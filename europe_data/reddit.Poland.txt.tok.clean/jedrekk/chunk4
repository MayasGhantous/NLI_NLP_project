  well , you see , it 's because the ussr won . 
   porn capital of europe not budapest ? 
  yeah , my friend peed on a stick , got a plus sign , went to her gyno , he says , `` you 're pregnant '' , she paused for a beat and he said something like , `` if that 's unacceptable , we can deal with it '' . 
  she laughed as she and her bf had been trying for kids , but it was funny how quickly the doctor went there . 
  i absolute adore [ super girl & romantic boys ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vokm01w2tc ) - their full album is on spotify . 
  i know the barbed wire in this comic is symbolism , but this is what [ part of the border actually looks like ] ( http://imgur.com/azl0qkm ) . 
  [ sv link ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=augustow%2c+poland&amp;data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d22.816838!3d54.381021!2m2!1f128.04!2f87.47!4f75!2m4!1e1!2m2!1s8ix-bvk9pko4ajloe6vaiw!2e0!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d36167847!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1479!2i1065!4f13.1&amp;fid=5 ), 
  i wish there were a ` electronics ' and ` premium goods ' graph , poland would be # 1 !, 
   by the was more than 95 % of polish energy comes from some sort of coal . 
  yeah , i always tell people that the difference between nuclear and coal power plants is that one spews out radioactive waste into the air 24/7 and the other does so only when there 's a major malfunction . 
  there 's actually a lot of discussion on that around the internet . 
  from what i 'm reading , it was trying to frame itself as a third world nation . 
  sorry , you misunderstood my point . 
  nyc is considered one of the most european cities in the us , mostly due to the population density ( and public transportation ) . 
  the reality is that even densely populated us cities are sparse and spread out compared to those in europe . 
  how so ? 
   the terms first , second , and third world are n't politically correct anymore . 
  your use of them was never considered correct . 
  the first world was the u s and its allies ; the second world was the communist bloc ; the third world was unaligned ( mostly african and south american nations ) . 
  barcelona 's population density is 16k/sq km , compared to new york 's 10k/sq km . 
  more bikes than cars in picture . 
  checks out . 
  a year or two ago ? 
  it was a thing when i lived there in 2005/6 . 
  i would n't pick a country , i 'd pick a city . 
  barcelona , berlin , copenhagen , stockholm are all on my list . 
  i have a lot more in common with other 30 year olds in those cities , than with 30 year olds in the rural areas of any of those countries , or mine for that matter . 
  yeah , but if helmut von deutschemeister goes to the store and buys 20kg of food , of which 5kg is packaging and recyclable while zosia kowalczyk goes to a market and brings home 16kg of food , of which only 1kg is packaging and both end up throwing away about 5kg of food waste ... 
  this is starting to sound like a elementary school word problem, 
  well in krak\u00f3w they make up for it with volume - about 10 years ago we used to go there to party and would just bring a roll of 10z\u0142 notes , since each cab ride would be 8-9z\u0142 + tip . 
  cabs are all we 'd use during our visit . 
  warsaw a big city where lots of people do n't like to drive so they 'll cab it . 
  i have no idea . 
  i think poland may be slightly unique in that bikes have traditionally been much more popular in rural areas than in cities . 
  warsaw taxis are cheap ( relatively ) , due to the amount of competition . 
  welcome to poland . 
  not really . 
  my problem with modern polish architecture is n't the * bloki * , they 're all the same all over the old eastern bloc and the ones in poland are n't really bad . 
  i thought they were , but then i went to the ukraine and czech republic and saw how bad they can get . 
  the problem i see is that a lot of modern developments emulate those old ones , with tiny , cramped flats built in seas of concrete , everything fenced in like you need to hide you 're wife , hide you 're kids , they 're stealing errything . 
  do n't get me started on the ugliness of modern single-family homes here . 
  it 's a goddamn mess . 
  they 're also quite popular in rural areas . 
  you 'll sometimes be driving down some tiny country road and see a pair of these in the middle of a field , remnants of an old * pgr * ( collectivized farm ) . 
  all the disadvantages of living in the middle of nowhere with the lack of intimacy of living a * blok * . 
  well then write ` romania ' instead of ` eastern europe ', 
  there 's enough room in shelters in warsaw for anybody who wants to stay there , but many people in need do n't want to because the shelters require them to be sober , and they 're not willing to do that . 
   1 ) there 's no state help for college , plus college is not free . 
  there are no study loans either . 
   2 ) working part-time is not really a ` thing ' so only full-time . 
  without college , you 're restricted to factory or waiting tables , both of which will only cover your rent and maybe a bit of food , but not college expenses too . 
  i 'm sorry , but both of these things are not true in poland . 
  i know people who go to university for free and lots of people who work part time jobs ( especially in retail/food service ), 
  the homeless people we notice using public transportation in warsaw stink . 
  there 's really no other term for it . 
  they smell like rotting meat . 
   the most expensive hotel in the city !, 
  i know you 're kidding , but at 250z\u0142 it 's cheaper than most hotels . 
  put 38 million people together on 312k km of land and things will always happen . 
  i mean , one in a million events will still occur 38 times . 
  so ... nothing , really . 
  t-mobile . pl 's roaming packages are for the entire eu , not just specific countries, 
  forgot one : 1 000 z\u0142 - ko\u0142o ( wheel ), 
  my slang is more criminal than higher education . 
  a couple more terms for money : szmal , dzi\u0119gi , plny , 1 000z\u0142 - tysiak , kafel ( tile ) 100 000 z\u0142 - du\u017ca ba\u0144ka ( used to mean 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 plz ) any number of z\u0142oty under 10 can be expressed as ` blach/y ' ( 2 blachy , 5 blach ) ( sheets of metal ) - not to be mistaken for blachy meaning license plates . 
   ba\u0144ka used to be 1 000 000 plz before we denominated fun fact : z\u0142ot\u00f3wa is a derogatory term for a cab driver, 
  ** poland ** 1 . 
  nothing . 
  yeah , some stuff happened , but stuff happens every second of every day everywhere in the world . 
  nothing of importance happened , something 's that quite obvious from the 24h news channels . 
  five years after poland entered the eu , a newspaper ran a series of interviews with people from around the eu who had moved here since . 
  i read the one with people from slovenia , who said the worst thing about living there was having their mail be delayed for 2-3 months as foreign post services kept sending it to slovakia ... 
  not the best source but ... http://www.fakt.pl/niewybuch-zabil-studenta,artykuly,170677,1.html, 
  we have it in poland , sure . 
  it 's called * pasztet * and chicken or pork are easily the most popular . 
  fun fact : when poland was finishing up the accession process in 2003 , there was a part of the political scene ( mostly the ` christian ' right ) that wanted poland to join nafta instead . 
  yeah , i own a crowbar . 
  if i use it to break into the neighbor 's flat is it the company 's fault , or mine ? 
   i guess what greece has to do is gas 10 million people , and shoot another 30 million to get a fair deal in the eu . 
  well , they could 've tried not cooking their books for years . 
  well , they updated the a2 extension and most p\u00f3\u0142nocny sometime around september , but one of the streets by my house which has been open since last year is still invisible . 
  the worst thing is , the routing data is completely disconnected from the visual presentation - so i saw the a2 and most p\u00f3\u0142nocny , and it just would not route . 
  man , stop shitting on apple maps . 
  i used google maps to go from the bielany district in warsaw to a dog kennel in piaseczno and it took us through a total of five closed or dirt rodes . 
  five . 
  a 30 minute drive turned into an hour 15 . 
  just because 5,000 miners show up for a strike , does n't mean it 's silesia either . 
  this conversation is so telling of poland right now . 
  the polish ex-pat who lives in switzerland identifying with a swiss flag telling everyone how awful poland is , while a foreigner talks it up . 
  do realize that a lot of countries have very high rates of taxation and you get fuckall in return for it . 
  someone needs to put that branch back . 
  i have a theory that native english speakers have a tough time learning other european because english is very simple . 
  if you speak french and you 're learning german , there 's a lot of overlap as far as all nouns being gendered and such . 
  when i learned german , spanish and french in english , it always started with : `` in this language , every noun has a gender . '', 
  yeah , bicycle touring through eastern germany i did n't meet many english speakers , especially in hotels . 
  i personally know a dozen ukrainians in poland . 
  they are all dual-citizens or have work visas . 
  the fact that less than 1 % of poland 's residents are immigrants is a lot more worrisome than anything else . 
  attempted armed robbery ... 
  i think 12 years is fine for that .
