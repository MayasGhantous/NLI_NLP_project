  yeah , dude 's not getting 12 years . 
  more like a night in the drunk tank and psychiatric screening . 
  then he would have probably brandished it instead of showing a drawing ? 
  really shitty dorms . 
  yes , but at the end of the day , all he had was the drawing . 
  yeah , i always tell people : after jfk was killed his policies flew through a very divided congress . 
  here , kaczy\u0144ski 's * identical twin brother * lost to a very lacklustre presidential candidate two months and 10 days after the crash . 
  can we stop with this trope that we have many immigrants ? 
  we have fuck all immigrants in poland , we are the least immigrant-friendly country in the eu . 
  i absolutely hate the fact that if i want to take a train to another eu capital city that 's 400km away ( warsaw -  vilinus ) , the current train connection through belarus . 
  i 'd love to have you but our politicians do still hate gays and the polls are trending right , until they spend 3-4 years in power and fuck up again , and then they 'll trend left again . 
  sure , come to poland . 
  if you 're christian , we 'll accept you as a refugee . 
  traditionally non-catholic countries do n't celebrate it at all , as your name day is the day of the canonisation of the saint that has your name . 
  i 've traveled more than my fair share of europe and no where did i feel as welcome as in croatia . 
  even in that one restaurant where the menu was a machine translated to polish and czech seemingly randomly, 
  i 'm polish and i do n't mind , but the one thing the author should remember is that hitler had it out for all slavs , croatians included . 
  that really reminds me of how my gf and i are n't typical polish tourists . 
  we went to a little village maybe 20 minutes south of makarska ( btw , when i first saw the riviera with its blue waters it took my breath away ) , our land lady spoke perfect english ( having lived in australia for a few years ) and it turned out that the only other people in our tiny little hotel were other poles !, 
  first thing the guy asked me was , `` how long did it take you guys to get here ? 
  i drove for 14 hours straight ! '', 
  to which i replied , `` we 've been on the road for 4 days , stopped in krak\u00f3w , budapest and zadar on the way '' . 
  we did n't talk for the rest of our week-long stay . 
  prague also has a lot more tourism than it did pre-1990 and that is a major magne for crime . 
  warsaw has lower numbers for street crime than london , berlin , paris , brussels , dublin , barcelona , etc etc, 
  because when polish people do stupid shit in ireland i facepalm and go , `` stupid motherfuckers had to do their stupid shit in ireland '' . 
  it does n't have anything to do with stereotypes , i 'd just rather my countrymen behaved abroad . 
  and murder !, 
  except for the fucking drug dealers . 
  i do n't hate slovakia , i 'd just literally rather go to any other country in the eu . 
  just because you do n't hear about them does n't mean they do n't happen . 
  a couple bombs and grenades are found in here in warsaw every year , it does n't make the news unless it 's a massive bomb ( like the 1500kg one they found in 2012 ) or it messes up traffic . 
   surprisingly , he wants a social security system ( presumably it 's due to the catholic influence ) the only parties that talk about dismantling social security here are fringe libertarians ( janusz korwin-mikke got 3 % of the presidential vote , for example ) when obama was pushing through the aca ( obamacare ) , american right-wingos were scaring their electorate with visions of nationalised hospitals . 
  at the same time , pis ( duda 's party ) was scaring its electorate with visions of privatised health care if their opposition won . 
  you forgot about germany losing quite a bit of land ( that they took in the 17the century ) . 
  so we 're not going to talk about how countries where car travel is incentivized ( poland , lithuania , the uk ) are some of the fattest while those where cycling and public transportation are popular ( denmark , holland , germany ) have some of the lowest rates of obesity ? 
  also check out the [ off festival ] ( http://off-festival.pl/ ) in katowice , [ orange festival ] ( http://orangewarsawfestival.pl/ ) in warsaw , and [ audioriver ] ( http://www.audioriver.pl/audioriver,2.html ) up in p\u0142ock . 
  they are very cheap compared to the big name festivals in western europe like roskilde , rock am * or glastonbury . 
  literally one of the two biggest festivals in europe . 
  when we moved back to poland in 1993 , i remember reading an article in the paper about how poland had started accession talks with the eu and remember thinking : `` i hope i live to see that '' now it 's 22 years later and i 've traveled to half the eu without more than my national id card in my pocket , what a time to be alive . 
  ** the lesser dutchy of poland ** * [ w\u0142adys\u0142aw bartoszewki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_bartoszewski ) - auschwitz survivor , politician , political prisoner under stalinism , social activist , anti-communist opposition member , wwii resistance fighter , journalist , writer , and historian - passed away at 93 . 
  he will be missed . 
  * two miners in the wujek coal mine have been trapped since last friday . 
  rescue operations are ongoing . 
  * the night wolves - a russian nationalist motorcycle club that planned on touring places the red army had fought in and died for during wwii - has been denied entry to poland as well as germany . 
  * * gimnazjum * students ( 9th year ) have spent the week taking exams to be placed into the high school of their choice . 
  sorry , that line should 've read : the smallest military to be an effective member of nato and secure the borders as we can . 
  because military spending , at the end of the day , is throwing money into the garbage . 
  look , just think of poland as a teenager with low self esteem : they hate themselves , think their lives are garbage but if you say anything bad about them get ready for a fight . 
  except that the `` working poor '' in poland take multiple international trips , own their own flats at 30-35 , have two relatively new cars ( because car ownership here is ridiculously cheap and if you 're making ~ 2000 $ / month you have a company car ) , eat out often and complain about taxes even though their effective income tax rates are under 18 % . 
  yep , as with anything , there is a balance . 
  getting rid of conscription was a great idea - we 'd been a country who 's military was made up of people too dumb to get out of serving . 
  no , car insurance is n't useless because your payment supports the car insurance industry . 
  it 's a shared cost that takes into account the fact that you will most likely as some point in time have a collision ( which is true of 2 % of polish drivers every year ) . 
  also , you paying for car insurance supports the system , which means that if someone crashes into you , their relatively low payment will cover the damage they do to you . 
  your analogy is crap and the people who 've upvoted you are idiots . 
  now , back to the original thread : the optimal thing to do is spend as little on the military as possible . 
  look , let 's be real : who can attack poland ? 
  germany , russia , ukraine , belarus . 
  everybody else is literally too small or is our ally . 
  we outspend ukraine and belarus , but we ca n't outspend germany or russia . 
  russia 's economy is 3x ours , germany 's is 7x - to get to their level of military spending we 'd need to allocate 8-12 % of our nationwide gdp to it . 
  if russia decides to come at as , and i mean really come at us , two things can happen : we can get beat or we can fight them back . 
  except that if we fight them back , they can pull out a couple nuclear bombs and we 're done . 
  our military needs to be able to handle countries that could realistically attack us and who we 'd have a chance of fighting off . 
  trying to build up an army to win with an all out russian offensive is a way to get beaten by them without them needing to fire a single shot . 
  but how does this fit into the polish circlejerk of how everything 's shit and poland keeps getting worse day by day ? 
  defense spending is social welfare for military contractors and do-nothing jobs for soldiers . 
  it is a societal and financial cost , unless you use it to project economic power , like the us or china do . 
  if we 'd bought $ 500 million of attack aircraft 25 years ago , we 'd be scrapping them now , half a billion dollars of taxpayers money in the shitter . 
  even money spent supporting unprofitable coal mines is better spent , at least those miners spend their money into the local economy . 
  ** the grand kingdom of poland ** * some 60 000 people were left without power on monday after hurricane-force winds swept through poland . 
  * the presidential campaign is in full swing , so there are more idiots in the news than usual . 
  * the head of america 's fbi wrote an op-ed where he referred to the `` murders and accomplices in germany , poland and hungary '' in the context of the holocaust . 
  unsurprisingly , polish politicians reacted with a big , `` fuck that dude '' and the america ambassador has apologized . 
  because , really , fuck that dude . 
  * local governments are considering fining parents who do n't vaccinate their kids . 
  * thousands of government employees/union members ( railroad workers , teachers , farmers , cops , firemen , etc ) protested in warsaw over ... something or other . 
  i just spent like 5 minutes trying to figure out what they were protesting and came up short . 
  great way to get your message out , guys . 
  * new information about the 2010 air crash that killed president lech kaczy\u0144ski and 92 others cast the air force in a poor light . 
  the crew was under-qualified , the weather data was bad ( or possibly falsified ) , etc, 
  nobody is giving this proper context . 
  the name was apt , it was factories , great and small . 
  like most factories from before the fall of communism , they were gone by the late 1990s , leaving behind large , open spaces and empty factory buildings . 
  mokot\u00f3w is warsaw 's largest district and the fastest growing district of the 1990s , ursyn\u00f3w , is right next door . 
  now , sp is small , it 's not even 2.5 sq km of land . 
  in the late 1990s a developer bought a parcel of land and built the first office park there , four buildings iirc , and a shopping mall across the street . 
  there was a massive deficit of office space in warsaw , back then , so developers started building there like crazy , there was so much relatively cheap land in a relatively central location !, 
  of course , as with any such quick growth infrastructure lagged behind heavily . 
  public transportation to s\u0142u\u017cewiec przemys\u0142owy was poor , and parking at a premium . 
  since a car was the ultimate status symbol and getting there by bus or tram was crap , everybody who could drove . 
  that resulted in massive traffic jams and cars strewn everywhere . 
  the mall built there had to limit free parking to three hours so office workers would stop filling up its parking lot all day . 
  for a long time , there was almost nothing there but offices . 
  some manufacturing remained ( very little ) , some sales offices for industrial equipment , but most of it has been sold to build more office parks . 
  and until lately , there was n't anything in those office parks but offices : no stores , restaurants , etc. 
  now , the biggest issue in the past few years has been simply : if you work at a corporate job , there 's a good chance this is where you 'll work . 
  almost any time a large corporation announces it 's moving offices , they 're moving there . 
  do you work at an ad agency ?
