  on any friday or saturday night , starting from 8pm you see groups of friends walking between clubs until the wee hours of the next day 's morning . 
  otherwise ... well , we 're a city with a metro area of 3.5 million . 
  people go to concerts , climb walls , take their boats out , ride bikes , dance , whatever . 
  the only thing you ca n't do here is anything involving mountains , since the entire area here is flat as fuck . 
  like kansas flat . 
  to expand : the two largest parties in poland for the past 15 years have been po and pis . 
  once political allies ( especially during the solidarity days ) , they 've grown apart . 
  after pis ' upset win in the 2005 elections , the parties fell out . 
  pis was unable to build a useful coalition with po so they went for the fringe parties in the parliament . 
  how fringe ? 
  none of them effectively exist anymore . 
  the government fell within 2 years and po won the next two elections easily . 
  then donald tusk , po 's leader , left to take over as the president of the european council and it turns out that po had nothing . 
  they completely botched the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections , losing both . 
  then-president bronis\u0142aw komorowski pretty much forgot to campaign , while his challenger - andrzej duda - was everywhere he could be . 
  still , duda only won by 3 % , a margin easily coverable if komorowski had actually bothered to show up . 
  that win helped pis take a first-ever ( since communism fell ) single party majority in the sejm just a few months later . 
  i too support razem , but i think pis is a lot more dangerous than korwin or wherever party their woman-beating leader is this day of the week . 
  thanks . 
  she 's - objectively - the best . 
  my daughter was born . 
  i had a friend working there for 6 weeks and she summed it up as , `` we loved that it was close to other places '', 
  negatives : in belgium, 
  if you 're worried about going to brussels because you might die of a terrorist attack ... then just stay home and keep your fear mongering there , thanks . 
  i think the problem is n't the price , it 's just you 're too scared to travel . 
  blablacar is the largest ride sharing service in the world . 
  about a quarter million rides are shared every day around the world . 
  you 're a lot more likely to be killed walking to the meet-up , than to be killed by the driver during the ride . 
  here 's the [ 40 $ round trip flight out of venice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8qe85al.png ) . 
  that 's to barcelona . 
  here 's a [ 25 $ round trip to berlin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ofjapjr.png ) for 3 days . 
  of course , you could just fly directly out of lju to [ brussels in a month for $ 29.98 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xqjy20r.png ) for our days on wizz . 
  and just for proof , here 're the 1 $ tickets we bought to [ budapest and milan ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7aju2 ) . 
  today , 4pln is 91 eurocents . 
  ride with [ tatjana in her q7 for 12 $ ] ( https://www.sk.blablacar.com/cesta-ljubljana-venice-697226682 ) . 
  fly ryanair to barcelona for [ 20 $ ] ( https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/booking/home/tsf/bcn/2016-12-30/2017-01-06/1/0/0/0 ) and fly back for 20 $ . 
  ride back for 12-15 $ with blablacar . 
  congratulations , you 've traveled 3000km for 64 $ . 
  note that the flight is n't in a year , it 's in 3 weeks . 
  i 'm seeing berlin for 26 $ round trip , corfu in march for 40 $ . 
  good stuff . 
  shit man , i had to pay 100 $ for corfu , got totally ripped off !, 
  i live in poland doing front end dev and i make a lot more than 1500 $ / month . 
  it 's not anywhere close to a lot of money . 
  naw , travel around europe is super cheap . 
  we skipped going to italy even though we had the tickets bought because we wanted to go to a friends ' party and the tickets only cost 1 $ . 
  we flew from poland to spain and back for 90 $ / person on a full fare airline ( lot ) . 
  if you have lots of time but little money , you can take a coach instead . 
  at 14km , it would n't be in the top 30 longest bridges in the world . 
  it would be the longest bridge in europe , as the current [ longest bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasco_da_gama_bridge ) is only 12.5 km long . 
  if you pretend that if it were n't for the british empire , then those countries would remain as they were before the british invaded them , then sure , it was amazing . 
  it 's kind of amazing how you speak against foreign cultures invading and the fall of the family unit , but not before bragging about the most invasive foreign culture that completely destroyed generations of people the world over . 
  your people killed others outright , through starvation , through policies , etc. 
  yeah , thanks for the ... 
  i 'm not sure what . 
  you did n't keep germany out , you did n't help the soviets get in . 
  poles died over the skies of britain . 
  oh , i know what you did : you sold us out to stalin , helping legitimize 45 years of soviet rule . 
  that 's some right wing dick juice backwash . 
  the `` family unit '' is great until your parents decide to beat you , abuse you , or control your life well into adulthood . 
  families are great in stories , the reality was one more of men selling off their daughters into marriage . 
  / v/stormwatch is over there . 
  extremist islam is more or less exactly like extremist catholicism . 
  i think the uk 's biggest failings is bitches like you do n't get your hands broken at birth . 
  people on here are pedantic until they make a mistake and then suddenly they get all mad and shit . 
  americans not paying into the health care system then flying over when they get cancer would get annoying very quickly . 
  lol in thinking that we 're the only nation that blames everything on jews . 
  see : france , germany , russia , etc. 
  ukraine . 
  because it 's always the jews . 
  when the communist party decided that poland 's problems in the mid 1960s did n't stem from the fact that we had a poorly run central economy , or that we were a soviet playtoy , or any of the real reasons ... no , it was the jews . 
  so by 1968 , polish jews were told that they could leave , but never come back . 
  and that 's where there are maybe 6,000 jews left in poland in 2016 . 
  no no , i mean that the kid that jumps out to mug you is your polish friend from school . 
  getting hit by a car at a pedestrian crossing when you have a green light means you might get a ticket and have the cops come to your house to make sure you 're not living with degenerates . 
  sidewalks in the very center of major cities are closed during massive construction projects to avoid narrowing streets from 3 to 2 lanes . 
  the fine for not paying for a parking space is equal to the cost of that space for a day . 
  getting a ticket for crossing an empty street . 
  the cops say `` this is a dangerous intersection '' . 
  it 's dangerous because drivers come off the street onto the sidewalk and kill pedestrians . 
  the first three things all happen in poland , except the gypsy kid is also polish . 
  england , germany , france , italy , spain , croatia , bosnia , austria , slovakia , slovenia , denmark , sweden , poland , holland , hungary , greece ( corfu ) , cyprus , ukraine , russia , vatican city ( although i hate the concept of micronations ) , portugal and czechia . 
  i loved berlin , copenhagen , and barcelona . 
  i 've edited this list ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 6 times as i 've remembered countries i 've visited . 
  a lot of the smaller restaurants and businesses in warsaw have gender neutral bathrooms . 
  they just do n't have the room for more than one sink/toilet . 
  that 's the personification of the country , not specific people . 
  also ... you 're kinda creepy . 
  poland is the annoying kid from middle school , the one with low self esteem who 'd be ok if he just got out of his head and stopped being so fucking needy . 
  berlin is n't even the financial capital of germany . 
  munich rents are much higher . 
  here in poland , the difference between the two groups is that people living in the sticks have no qualms calling city folks fucking idiots , while city slickers feel bad when they make fun of country bumpkins . 
  america 's relatively low col is the direct result of there being so many poor people . 
  pro-business politicians actually * love * illegal immigrants , they just fight programs that are meant to legalize them , because making them legals would mean they would have to be paid minimum wage . 
  how many full time european employees are on social assistance vs americans - when it 's much harder to get it in the us . 
  the poles who love american health care do n't realize private health insurance in poland costs less than many americans ' copays . 
  i spent a decade in the us and a week in canada . 
  it was ... * ok * . 
   she set up her own e-mail server , which is unprecetented . 
  there is simply no comparable case .
