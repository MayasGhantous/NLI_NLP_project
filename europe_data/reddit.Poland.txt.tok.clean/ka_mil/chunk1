haha , your political situation seems to be worse than the one in poland . 
  your left is actually populist nationalists ? 
  would n't say that there 's something wrong with a slogan such `` proud to be romanian '' , but if there 's nothing more to it then i would start to worry . 
  also did n't your big parties ( i think there are 3 main parties in romania ? ), 
  pass the legislation that actually favours them in the elections , so it 's harder for the newcomers to get into politics ? 
  remember news like this from last year , few romanian redditors were posting stuff about it here , in r/europe . 
  yes , because how romanian is someone 's name is the most important factor in the election . 
  if i remember correctly someone posted an article here how this whole internet tax thing was basically a cover story for orban 's government pushing to start building south stream . 
  he did it without consulting or getting approval from the eu . 
  but yeah , everyone focused on the internet tax and forgot about the other thing . 
  do you still love us ? 
  well it seems that you live in the us so that 's a tough choice to make . 
  but i think it 's now easier to get polish citizenship for a jewish person , however i never looked into it . 
  but yeah , i wish poland would be multicultural again . 
   there were pogroms in poland i mean yeah , they were , but i 'm pretty sure the number of victims was n't that huge . 
  ( and i do n't meant to defend the idiots that are responsible for it ) . 
  there was still a huge jewish population in poland after regaining our independence . 
  they should come back home . 
  there was a short documentary on guardian 's website telling a story of few refugees who said that sweden gives them more options and opportunities than other countries so that 's the main reason for them to go there . 
  found it : http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/20/death-sea-syrian-migrants-film-europe-video, 
  we should accept way more than that . 
  where the fuck are we ? 
  :( i though you liked us :(, 
   why complain ? 
  this is what multiculturalism is all about . 
  no , no it 's not . 
   for the first time in history of football poland won with germany we won with east germany few times !, 
  that counts !, 
   poland yeah , sorry about that . 
  what 's worse it does n't look like it will change anytime soon . 
  and she says shit like this :  `` you know , i 'm a woman , '' she said . 
  `` i can imagine what i would do if i saw a person waving a sharp tool or holding a gun . 
  my first thought would be : right behind me , there is my house and my children . 
  so i 'd rush back and protect my children . ''  a man , she said , would react differently . 
   `` he would think : i do n't have a decent stick at hand , but so what ? 
  am i not going to stand up and beat them up just because they dared to come here and threaten my family ? '' she said . 
  she was asked if poland should sell weapons to ukraine ... http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/world/europe/new-leader-likens-poland-to-reasonable-polish-woman.html?_r=0, 
  estonia can not into nordic :p, 
  no one is better than berba . 
  well maybe zlatan . 
  even that you only mentioned konigsberg i 'm already nervous ... 
   annexation by poland is n't that place one giant military base by now ? 
  it 's too late man , i do n't see that anythign about kaliningrad can change in next few years . 
  do they even have some kind of autonomy/independece movement ? 
  i doubt that . 
  apparently yeltsin offered to sell it back to germany in the early 90 's but germany refused . 
  i like schetyna as a politician , but do n't see him as a foreign minister . 
  i think it 's pretty stupid to do this right now , it weakens poland . 
  schetyna was a a leader of a foreign affair committee in our parliament but that is n't enough . 
  and it was still considered to be a downgrade for him . 
  kopacz wanted to make everyone in the party happy , when the news about sikorski leaving got out schetyna and his people were openly criticising it , so i guess she offered him the place . 
  i was hoping that president wo n't allow it but his relations with sikorski are n't great either . 
  to be honest schetyna as a fm might be his idea , they seem to get along well and with tusk in brussels these two might want to take over the civic platform . 
  few that have n't been mentioned : * [ warszawskie dzieci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxytwuye8wq ) * [ czerwone maki na monte cassino ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iab33qfdw-g ) * [ hej ch\u0142opcy bagnet na bro\u0144 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9ulddhixmq ) * [ my , pierwsza brygada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsl6gfvfc0a ) * [ warszawianka - la varsovienne - 1831 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb_zqdateog ) * [ \u017burawiejki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndy0ea6gc4 ) - these were pretty short songs wirtten for our cavalary . 
  they 're usually pretty funny . 
  the chours says : `` lances for the battle , sabres in hand , chase the bolshevik , chase , chase . '', 
  yeah , like it did n't cause us enough trouble last time . 
  well first they should stop occupying north cyprus , then we can start talking . 
  i ca n't imagine even discussing it with them while they 're in a conflict with one of the eu members . 
  argh . 
  we did n't do it . 
  it 's was german propaganda that was supposed to show how much more advance technologically they were . 
  and for some reason was used by our filmmakers after the war to show how heroic polish soldiers were . 
  well yeah , but right now both sides almost hate each other ... 
  that 's what i always thought about you and scots . 
  similar history and lots of alcohol consumption . 
   czech and slovak are basically the same , too to each other yeah , but not to poland . 
  well maybe slovaks , but i 'm not sure about czechs . 
  they think about us as a backwards country full of fundamental catholics , we think about them as germanised slavs without god and cowards because they did n't fight in ww2 . 
  i remember a good article about it , but it 's in polish so majority of this sub wo n't understand it . 
  anyway for the fellow poles from r/europe : http://www.ahistoria.pl/index.php/2011/06/co-sadza-i-sadzili-czesi-o-polakach/, 
   i would also point out that britain and france offered to give poland military materiel . 
  but they refused on the grounds that it would anger nazi germany . 
  did n't hear about that , i got to say i 'm surprised about the whole `` not making germans angry '' thing as i do n't think we cared back then . 
   t 's the unholy trinity for them nah mate , i mean yeah , many poles still feel kind of betrayed but you will never top germany and russia . 
  also moods about germany and germans changed in recent years , majority of the society thinks about them positively nowadays . 
  although there 's a lot of `` white flag '' jokes about france . 
  but it 's mainly people who do n't know french history , how many people died in wwi and how successful their army was till wwi that make those jokes . 
   i 've had this conversation . 
  it boils down the polish being mad at the french and british for not kicking nazi germany out of poland from day one . 
  of course it 's utter bullshit since we still went to war and after dunkirk got our cities bombed etc. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal well we expeteced your reaction from day one . 
  but as it turns out britain was n't even preaper for war at that point . 
  all you did was dropping leaflets in germany . 
  france on the other hand was ready to fight but they got stuck on the siegfried line . 
  both sides promised too much to each other . 
  according to reports that were sent to london our army was n't read either and germany airforces really fucked us over . 
  this is what one of our general , j\u00f3zef jaklicz said when someone from the britsh army asked him how could britian help poland . 
  it was on the 9th of september :  it ca n't . 
  ( ... ) it 's too late . 
  we expected your help from day one , everyday . 
  we were expecting bombing of germany and their army which is now devastating our armies . 
  bombardment that could at least partially liberate polish sky from german planes , slow down the pace of german tans and give us time to organise the defence on the vistula river . 
  today is too late . 
  ( ... ) but the fate of our independence will be decided not on the vistula river , but on the rhine . 
  and yeah , it 's worh noting that few days later our eastern `` friends '' decided to pop in and help germans out . 
  also yeah , we did feel betrayed when we felt under soviet union wings . 
  but churchill ca n't be blamed for that , it was roosvelt 's fault . 
  he trusted stalin too much and ignored every warning . 
  that 's impressive .
