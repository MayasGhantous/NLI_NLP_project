  they probably know english , to a certain point , and someone that 's already in the uk . 
  not all that welfare bs that some idiots on here are trying to push . 
  my bad . 
  yeah , by finns , norwegians and poles . 
  why is there such a big afghani population in that one region in eastern germany ? 
  election has been announced last week , they 've probably just realised their new manifestos . 
  the wiki article is probably older than that . 
  i 'm actually surprised that social democrats want to keep it , and pretty much almost everyone else ( except people 's party ) want to revoke it and make immigration easier . 
  good for you denmark !, 
  i do n't think they had a choice , they would n't be able to form a government otherwise . 
  besides , are n't both of the ideologies similar ? 
   right wing parties on the rise in serbia so , nothing new ? 
   declaring jesus christ as king of poland there actually was a candidate that was proposing this in this year 's elections ... 
  sierra nevada and rekordeling ( well that 's a cider , but i guess it kind of counts ? 
  great , so we have two centre-right candidates in the 2nd round . 
  one of them does n't believe in global warming , wanted to put doctors into prison for preforming ivf and would probably be strongly influenced by a leader of his party . 
  another one is n't really a great president , making gaffes everywhere he goes and probably would veto more socially liberal bills . 
  it sucks to be a polish liberal . 
   because that would mean end to ( partie wodzowskie - i have no idea how to translate it ) . 
  would it really ? 
  something like a chief whip would be established in each party and they would still vote like their leaders would expect them . 
  look at uk and usa again . 
   but first past the post is such a stupid idea and it 's good they did n't deliver . 
  but they did !, 
  they 're used everywhere except sejm because that would require changing the constitution . 
  it 's a bit funny , because people claim that it would get more local , independent politicians in but just look at senat elections results or election to voivodeship sejmiks . 
  only 5 , or 6 of them have some kind of local political groups in with very few seats . 
  he only had 65 % in early january when no one knew who duda was and no one else was running . 
  his campaign was awful but there was no way he could have got 60 % in a first place . 
  but they wo n't as example of france , usa , or the uk shows . 
  it would be pretty stupid to switch to such an archaic system . 
  if we were changing system stv is the best option . 
   we got few mosques here who openly support them how does your government react to that ? 
  do they ignore it , or maybe arrest someone ? 
  actaully , why are lib dems so popular over there ? 
   isis does n't have much to do with migrants crossing the mediterranean . 
  well it kind of does . 
  there 's a war in libya and isis are supporting one side of the conflict . 
  we really fucked up there ... 
  well cameron and sarkozy promised to help libya few years ago , but i 'm not sure if anything happened ... 
  if i 'm not wrong the country is torn apart right now . 
  eu has to work with north african countries if we want to control the immigration and asylum seekers . 
  we had a similar pact with soviets and that did n't stop them either . 
  also you 've mentioned cherry picking , and then ignore the fact that zaolzie was taken from us by czechoslovakia in 1919/1920 when we were fighting bolsheviks . 
  our sea is n't that great to be honest ... ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ germany , ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ back . 
  poland was always multicultural , and was known for being a fairly tolerant country . 
  we had a huge jewish population and a pretty big armenian population , and most people were getting together . 
  tensions started to appear in 19th century and later in the inter-war period . 
  it 's because of stalin that poland became mono-ethnic . 
  anyway poland will have to become multicultural again anyway , mainly because of demography . 
  there 's already a fairly big vietnamese population living in poland . 
  what we should do is to look what others had done , what they did wrong ( like putting all the immigrants in badly designed ghettos and leaving them on their own ) and make sure both sides integrate together . 
  yeah , fuck them for trying to improve their lives and lives of thier families . 
  all the smole\u0144sk 's crash theories ... also there is a few conspiracy theories about [ sikorski 's death in 1943 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w\u0142adys\u0142aw_sikorski%27s_death_controversy#alternative_explanations_and_conspiracy_theories ) . 
  we could have been best buddies ( lithuania does n't want to talk to us :( ) . 
  off topic but i really like your white-red-white flag , wish you were still using it , instead of that communist abomination . 
  guys , what about [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/flag_of_central_lithuania.svg ) ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it was mentioned in my geography lessons , especially problems with water in silesia . 
  for some reason he 's posting videos about poland now : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/312an7/the_animated_guide_to_polands_success/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/312ajk/a_trip_around_poland/, 
  well , except people being just stupid , forgetting about hundreds of years of history of jews in poland and both nations coexisting , there are some arguments that people disliking jews usually comes up with : - they claim that jews did not assimilate with the polish society in the past . 
  - they claimed that most of the communist secret police were jews and after the war they were chasing after poles who fought nazis and soviets . 
  i have no source of that being true , but i 'm guessing there should be a way of finding out if it 's true or not . 
  - they ( jewish people ) are ungrateful to us for all that we did for them , they still want our money and our property . 
  personally i think it 's a shame that there 's still some antisemitism in poland . 
  i wish we were still a divers and multicultural as in the past . 
  it 's because people are idiots and think that romanian and romani people ( who do n't have the best reputation in poland ) are the same . 
  sorry romania :(, 
  part of czechoslovakia that was a part of poland in 1920 , with a polish majority living there , until they annexed it while we were to busy fighting bolsheviks . 
  as far as i remember they were also blocking western supplies coming to poland during that war . 
  kind of a dick move . 
  that also lead to hostility between both countries during inter-war period , which is a shame . 
  do n't you guys like austrains more than us anyway ? 
  i 'm too lazy to look for some recent statistic though . 
  not this bullshit again . 
  you know slavs were next in line after jewish people right ? 
  i 'm curious , how are bavarians feeling about him ? 
  i know that some/most of them hated prussia . 
  nah , thanks , we 're not falling for that one again . 
   hit the poles so hard that they despair of their life ; i have full sympathy with their condition , but if we want to survive , we can only exterminate them ; the wolf , too , can not help having been created by god as he is , but people shoot him for it if they can . 
  what a lovely man , he sympathised with us . 
  i 'm not a fan of bismarck but come on , ad hitlerum is not helping your case . 
   atilla oh , so he 's a jobbik 's mp ? 
  so is lithuania planning on improving their air force , or not ? 
  nah , let 's bring the commonwealth back instead . 
   first european country to recognise a palestinian state . 
  not really ... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine, 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm not so sure about that ... 
  i think at first it was our join project to get into eu . 
  then it became rather irrelevent , now , because of the war in ukraine , it could be playing a bigger role but i 'm afraid it wo n't . 
  i read somewhere thar everyone except us is getting closer to austria ... screw you guys :(, 
  go away , join your northern friends , leave our bros alone . 
  to russia , we do n't want anything to do with him and he 'll fit right in in putinland . 
  he 's coming to visit soon . 
   we even had a very nasty civil war that lasted years . 
  and back then we actually accepted few thousands ( 12,300 ) of greek refugees of that war . 
  some of them returned and apparently got deported because our communist government suspected them of being titoist agents . 
  i did n't actually know about that part . 
  anyway , according to the latest census ( 2011 ) there was only 3600 people identifying as greek living in poland .
