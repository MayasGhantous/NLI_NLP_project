  what a shitty club to be a part of . 
  any rundown of serbian election ? 
  looks like the ruling party/bloc has around 50 % in the opinion polls , so i 'm guessing the next parliament will be pretty pro-european ? 
  so a french person want british people to do something ? 
  they 'll vote `` remain '' just to piss her off , 
  there 's also [ polin ] ( http://www.polin.pl/en ) - a museum that covers the entire history of polish jews , and i think it gets a really good press , same as the warsaw uprising museum . 
  i 'm sorry but you 're missing out , pola\u0144ski is a great filmmaker . 
  that 's what the government is trying to tell people but a lot of activists and conservationists disagree . 
   nd sell them for foreign hunters lol what , they do want to cut trees there but no one is going to be hunting bisons . 
  most poles from areas that we 've lost to the ussr were forced to move to [ recovered territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) . 
  yeah , at first i thought it was supposed to be a statistic of all sciencists in the ussr back then , then i realised i 've misread the title . 
  and yeah , they 've managed to get rid of most of the [ poles in the ussr in the 1938 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_\\ ( 1937 -- 38 \\ ) ) . 
  only to deport people from easter poland to [ siberia and kazakhstan two years later ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_\\ ( 1939 -- 46 \\ ) #mass _ deportations_to_the_east ) . 
  no poles ? 
  [ balcerowicz to the rescue ? 
  ] ( http://wbj.pl/leszek-balcerowicz-may-become-the-prime-minister-of-ukraine/ ) ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ lviv ^ ^ ^ ^ back, 
  good . 
   by trying to take over the world . 
  looks like we found sultan erdogan 's account guys !, 
  was he killed because he wished people happy easter , or because he was most likely a ahmadiyya muslim , which some other orthodox muslims consider to be heretics ? 
  although i 'm not actually sure which one is worse ... 
  wait , what 's actually wrong with that website ? 
  when i 'm looking for news about middle east i usually use that or al jazeera . 
  oh sorry , my bad . 
  so you can use your 0 numbers of bombers and tanks . 
  daesh is probably shitting themselves right now . 
   our president wants war . 
  with what ? 
  0 fighter jets that lithuania has ? 
  abdeslam claims that he did n't know about the plot to attack brussels and i 'm sure as hell not going to take rt 's word as a gospel . 
   i 'm generally a leftist ideologically and voted for . n , well then you 're not really a leftist if you 've voted for a neoliberal party which is at best centrist when it comes to social issues . 
  shameful . 
  but that 's what happens when populist nationalists get the majority . 
   secularist dictators supported by the west is exactly what gave us the middle east that we have today . 
  west made sure that leftist secular parties were marginalised during the cold war because they were scared that they were going to cooperate with the soviet union . 
  and now it came back to bite us in the butt . 
  here 's me hoping for an upset and both benfica and atletico going further . 
  especially with the whole ` curse '' thing going on around benfica i would n't mind seeing them in a final , 
  well duh . 
  semidictatorial state , with awful human rights record , that seems to drift away from europe , not closer and is alsooccupying territory of one of the member states . 
  of course they should n't join . 
  yeah , what was that navy bs ? 
  one day i do n't come on this sub and thst happens ... 
  i think they 're quite popular in western ukraine , but i do n't think anyone related to them is in ukrainian parliament . 
  right sector has 1 mp , not sure about other nationalistic parties . 
  however like i mentioned above it was yushchenko , who had our and wester support and was considerated moderate who awarded these people . 
  ukrainian neonazist celebrating nationalists and nazis from ukrainian insurgent army , in particular roman shukhevych , who 's responsible for this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia he was even awarded the hero of ukraine award by yushchenko , but fortunately some ukrainians came to their senses and it was annulled few years later . 
   the party characterizes itself as a eurosceptic , nationalist party based on historical continuity with slovak people 's party ruled in clerical fascist world war ii slovakia wtf slovakia . 
  are you planning on invading again ? 
   each of whom came out of the different sides of the irish civil war any more insight into it ? 
  fg were pro-treaty and ending the war while ff wanted to carry on fighting ? 
  take orban with you . 
  scumbags, 
  as far as we know he was only their agent during the 70 's . 
  solidarity started in 1980 . 
  the only new information is the fact that he did in fact received money from the secret police , he was always denying that part . 
  from what i read they were mostly algerian and moroccan . 
  not exactly refugees . 
  i thought yabloko was the biggest opposition party in russia ? 
  eleven . 
  i 'll probably just look for a stream on reddit . 
  how 's obama 's legacy fucked ? 
  lead the country out of the recession , pretty low unemployment , got the deal with iran and restarted the relations with cuba . 
  how is that bad ? 
  cruz talks about `` carpet bombing '' syira , trump apparently has a magical plan how to destroy daesh . 
  sanders and paul were the only dove candidates ... 
  started with grunge and bands from seattle . 
  it seems like a pretty great city , so in american sports i kind of support teams from there , shame about them losing sonics . 
  yes , but i 'm a neutral this year , panthers kicked `` my team '' out , so i might give up during the game . 
  depends on how does the first half end . 
  so their going to get unarmmed helicopters instead ? 
  because that 's what was offered ( i think by sikorsky ? 
  and airbus would have a factory in poland as well ( i think it was supposed to be in lodz ) because that was in the deal . 
  germany doesnt recognise immigrants as an official minority . 
  it has been explained so many times and yet there are still people complaining about it . 
  this is seriously their official party broadcast ? 
  because it looks like an amature work of a random youtuber . 
  anyway , there is a long way for them to join eu , they 've only closed one chapter . 
  [ 15 to go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) . 
  they have a bad human rights record , pretty much an authoritarian governmant and i serioulsy ca n't imagine them joining eu while still occupying terriroty of another member of the union ( cyprus ) . 
  it pretty much a no issue right now , no one wants them to join , i think erdogan is n't interested as much as he used to be . 
  so again , they 're creating a fictional issue rather than deal with actual problems . 
  also that farming bit , i 'm pretty sure that the reason why the uk rebate exists . 
  well yeah , but moldova is the poorest country in europe . 
  if all of a sudden they would become romanian therfore eu citizens they could move wherever they wanted . 
  with the current mood around immigration in europe i ca n't see any of the old eu countries being happy with that . 
  theoretically could eu block this ? 
  what would moldova 's status be in the union ? 
  centre right has been in power in germany since 2005 ... 
  the current minister of interior is from merkel 's party , same as the guy who 's vin charge of finance . 
  why on earth is he bringing falklands back into the public debate ? 
  there 's nothing going on and the new president of argentina wants to bury the hatched , but all of a sudden corbyn is proposing this . 
  just why . 
  it 's like he does n't want to win in the future ... 
  hahaha , how long are you guys planning of using that pathetic excuse ? 
  previous government did something bad so we can do it as well and you ca n't criticise us !, 
  this law is even worse than what previous government proposed , which , by the way , was blocked by the constitutional tribunal that currently is pretty much paralysed , thanks to the new government . 
  plans ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the law was passed few days ago ...
