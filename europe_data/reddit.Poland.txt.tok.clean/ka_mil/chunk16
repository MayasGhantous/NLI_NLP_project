  or le pen 's fraction if you want to go full on nationalistic . 
  verhofstadt is considering running for schultz 's position so i guess he would need their votes ... 
  she 's actually appealing to disenfranchised working class in the north , it 's her party in the south ( led by another le pen , marion ) that are full on libertarian . 
  i think the divide was pretty visible in the last regional elections . 
  because he 's probably an edgy libertarian/conservative liberal and thinks that everything should be privatised . 
   more religious version of margrethe thatche that 's fillon . 
   french orban with light vichy sauce that 's le pen . 
  the article is about centre-left candidate , macron , gaining support and coming closer to these two . 
  your point ? 
  so how does it work , president appoints a new pm or do italians go out and vote in couple of weeks/months ? 
  well if that 's the case , why the hell would renzi risk it and go ahead with this referendum ? 
  renzi 's party ? 
  a lot of the voted for no , or at least that 's what i 've read . 
  we 'll see what the polls say after the referendum . 
  a lot of leftist voted no you genius . 
  the reform seemed undemocratic for some . 
  jusy v4 things ... 
  what the hell merkel ? 
  putting schroder and merkel next to each other , claiming that she 's somehow pro-russian is just ridiculous ... 
  jesus , the anti-german sentiment was n't this popular since the polish people 's republic ... 
  pretty sad actually , as they 're one of out biggest allies ... also it 's rich coming from a bunch of far right skinheads using a still frame from an old soviet movie about the the anti-german resistance in belarus . 
  poor cyprus :(, 
  officially not , but there 's more and more weird russian connection to the ministry of defence ... 
  [ ftfy ] ( http://cdn12.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/108360/jaroslaw_kaczynski.jpg ), 
  we already are . 
  also the christ among nations mentality does n't help . 
  you 'd be surprised how many idiots refuse to acknowledge that fact and really think that allying with nazi germany was an option . 
  it got a lot of traction in recent years in the right wing circles , which is funny , because polish nationalist were always pro-russian . 
  how many of them are privatised ? 
  are you really expecting a thank you card after 300 years ? 
  another reason that shows how useless the v4 is . 
  would be much better if we got closer with nordic countries and baltic states . 
  at least they share our doubts about putin 's russia . 
  the group fulfilled its goal in 2004 when all of the members joined the eu . 
  well even though the solidarity was a trade union it was a mix of lot of people with different ideologies . 
  leftiests , social democrats , christian democrats , liberals , and conservative catholics . 
  so after the fall of communism/real socialism , everyone went their own way and somehow there was a consensus that the party of the old regime will become the main left wing party in the new , democratic poland . 
  there were attempts of restarting the historic lefties party , [ polish socialist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_socialist_party ) or establishing a brand new social democratic party that had it roods in the old opposition ( [ labour union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labour_united ) , they did surprisingly well in 1993 , but lost the election in 1997 and were out of the parliament ) but that did n't work . 
  right now left is n't even represented in polish parliament . 
  what makes it harder for them to establish themselves is the fact that pis has used a lot of left wing slogans and is introducing some reforms that could be described as left wing . 
  there are grassroots attempts of creating a new left , by the greens , local city movements and by the new [ razem party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razem ) but do n't know if that will change anything . 
   it was the feeling of supremacy , the imperialism and a pure greed for riches , resources , land . 
  that 's exactly what nationalism is . 
   you do realize that poland exists today because of nationalists who fought for their country and their nation during wwii and the communist regime imposed by ussr ? 
  rewriting history are n't we ? 
  because you surely ca n't call ak nationalists . 
  nationalists were `` great '' when they were burning belarusian or lithuanian villages , or attacking jews in pre-war poland , but actually helping poland ? 
  not so much . 
  their chauvinistic policies and their influence in the government exile did us no favour in the aftermath of the war . 
  disgraceful and repetitive . 
  same soundbites over and over again . 
  not really different to the right wing of pzpr from the 50s and 60s . 
  too bad our opposition is a joke and the left does n't exist in poland . 
  it 's an outspoken minority on the internet that keeps repeating it . 
  same like you 'll find some ukrainians claiming przemy\u015bl to be ukrainian clay . 
  nation of immigrants and refugees is now turning its back on people in need . 
  shameful . 
  you 're part of europe !, 
  good job france !, 
  vive la france !, 
  hmmm , on one hand with got an exbanker with a centrist manifesto and an allaged bank account in caymans . 
  on the other hand we 've got a far right/fascist candidate . 
  who do i choose , it 's so tough ... 
  przemys\u0142 ii got assassinated/murdered .

  hey op :  native speakers 55 million ( 2010 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_language, 
  i mean they were using cyrillic only since 1940 , before that they 've used latin alphabet . 
  they 're in the uefa , they 're european by my standards . 
  french get lots of money for their farmers , british get a [ rebate . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate ), 
  spending on research and development in poland is a joke . 
  he 's there representing eurosceptical people , and verhofstadt is n't really helping by calling farage 's wage the biggest waste of money in eu . 
  i love that part when lenin was brought by germans . 
  this reminded me of this clip form the west wing : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zbc2dverm, 
  because if he was green he would die . 
  exacly , they needed help form an old friend , could n't do it alone . 
  why ? 
  on 11th ( or 7th for some people ) of november 1918 poland became independent again , after 123 years of partitions . 
  15th of july ? 
  so you would much more prefere to celebrate a victory that happend in 1410 ? 
  we celebrate a constitution day in may , and more people start to celebrate 6th of june as well , to mark our first , almost free elections . 
  we also celberate a day when we kicked their asses 1920 , so we win . 
  well it 's not a typical polish dish , it 's a fast food , usually sold in places that serve burgers , hot dogs , chips/fires . 
  and yeah , most of the time it 's from the freezer so it wont be fresh . 
  also on that day poland celebrates its [ independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_independence_day ) . 
  take that germany , austria and russia . 
  whhaaat ? 
  are you serious ? 
  it 's like a cheap version of a pizza on a baguette . 
  it 's really not that bad man . 
   a polish dish without ~ ~ mushrooms ~ ~ cabbage on it ? 
  that cant be right . 
   ftfy , 
  czechs are ahead of us again . 
  it will take a while till a na ` vi will try to become a president in poland . 
  depends where are you going ? 
  if you 're going to be in northern parts you 'll defenetly need a coat , or a jacket , plus some hat and gloves . 
  it should be snowing in most of europe by then . 
  opposition should be happy , right ? 
  there 's no way she could win ?
