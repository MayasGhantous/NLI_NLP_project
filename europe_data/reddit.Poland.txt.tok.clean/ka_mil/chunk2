  highest turnout in poland was 68 % in the second round of presidential election in 1995 . 
  oh yeah , that 's embarrassing . 
  at first i thought that `` valdeltagande : 83,4 % '' meant that 83 % of votes were counted , not that it 's literally means `` turnout '' . 
  if fi already got 3 % and votes from bigger cities have n't been counted yet it means that they might actually get some mps ... what the hell sweden . 
  first sd , now this ? 
  europe 2022 looks ok to me . 
  getting old colonies back plus some extra clay in the south . 
  also poor turkey , still a eu candidate in 2022 . 
  are you still an eurosceptic ? 
  how do you see the future of the eu ? 
  yep . 
  that 's why even that lib dems got 23 % of the votes they only got 57 seats . 
  meanwhile labour got 29 % and 258 seats . 
  well sweden does n't use fptp voting . 
  that helps ... 
  i see that social democrats will almost definitely win it . 
  what 's their stance on the war in ukraine ? 
  i 'm asking because our centre-right government worked fairly well with your centre-right government on international matters . 
   nobody can make an unwilling population change their currency !, 
  they only thing is , we agreed to it by joing the eu . 
  one of the requirments was that all of the new memebers will have to adopt euro at some point . 
  the last satirical party that we had in poland was [ polish beer-lovers ' party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers'_party ) but that was ages ago . 
  but the craziest we 've sent ? 
  them : [ self-defence of the republic of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-defence_of_the_republic_of_poland ) [ league of polish families ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_polish_families ) [ congress of the new right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_the_new_right ), 
   they want to ban the armed forces and send lgbt-groups to places like uganda and saudi arabia to solve problems instead . 
  it 's like they hate gay people ... do they have any chance of getting into riksdag ? 
  i think you 've got the elections this weekend/next weekend ? 
   well if he did a good enough score to be elected in the european elections i guess there 's chances he will make it also in the legislatives ... 
  turnout for european elections is always low in poland . 
  that works for him and his party because his voters always go and vote . 
  when it comes to general election the turnout is still low , but it 's around 50 % so it will be harder for him to pass the 5 % treshold . 
  although they are doing well in polls ... 
  sorry for no french post , sadly i picked german as my 3rd language at school ( and what 's worse i ca n't even speak german now : / ) . 
  nope mate , that flag is older than that . 
  i said this before , when that map was posted here last time : silesian autonomy movement is n't that big . 
  [ silesian autonomy movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_autonomy_movement ) is only popular in [ silesian voivodeship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_voivodeship ) and maybe in opole voivodeship . 
  lower silesia voivdeship is n't even inhabited by silesian people anymore , most of people who live there now are the descendants of poles who were forced to leave [ kresy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kresy ) . 
  [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/active_separatist_movements_in_the_european_union.png ) shows the potential autonomy region much better . 
  also kashubia looks huge on that map as well . 
  in reality it looks liked this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashubia, 
  well i guess he 's just too afraid to call our leaders . 
   also there has to be a better way to differentiate former heads of state . 
  those little crosses confused me . 
  for a minute i thought that george bush sr and king juan carlos had died . 
   and the only reason i actually think / u/pablospicyweiner [ 1 ] is so fervently supportive of this well i hope it is n't , i am kind of supporting it , as in my opinion every nation has a right to govern itself if they wish to . 
  also i like scots and irish because our history is kind of similar . 
  been bullied by bigger , stronger neighbours for ages now it 's finally their time to shine . 
   and yeah i agree with you , independent scotland is definitely in favour of germany and i would say france as well . 
   weak spain i hope spaniards wo n't be mad at me , but to my knowledge they were never big deal in eu and after the economy crisis they position became even weaker . 
  poland and spain could be comparable and i think that at the moment poland has more to say in eu than them . 
  of course this is because we have a big support from germany and our foreign policy was always pro eu . 
  well yeah , it will probably strengthen germany 's position in europe even more :p, 
  rip visegr\u00e1d group . 
  well it already exist . 
  battle group i-2010 and weimar battle group . 
   i guess po support will fall to around 10 % now i 'm pretty sure it will actally go up , at least for few weeks . 
  question to belgian redditors : did van rompuy get involved in your politics after he become the european council president ? 
  becaue i 'm wondering what 's going to happen now , it looks like if he 's going to take the job he 's going to be replaced by kopacz , and her best asset is that she 's loyal to tusk . 
  so i wondering if he 's still going to try being in charge from brussels . 
  but still , as i said before , i would much rather preferred sikorski taking the fm job and danish pm becoming the council president . 
  also wtf is going on in the comment section on guardian 's website . 
  apparently poland has sent troops to ukraine and we want to start a ww3 . 
  kremlinbots are getting more ridiculous with each day ... 
  i hope not . 
  i want sikorski to take over ashton 's position . 
  helle thorning-schmidt can become the new president . 
  also i feel like he is the glue that keeps his party together . 
  there 's a hug mix of christian democrats , liberals , conservative liberals and even some leftist in his part and there 's no one that could really replace him . 
  200 is completely different to the rest of them . 
  so you 've got two designs of fake currency going . 
  nice . 
  that 's interesting because i always thought that bulgaria is one of the most pro-russian countries in europe . 
  just next to serbia and belarus . 
  do n't read the comments under the article . 
  trust me . 
  [ independence day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_independence_day ) - 11 november . 
  regain our sovereignty in 1918 . 
  usually there are some marches in bigger cities , people leaving flowers at soldiers graves , nationalists and antifacists are fighting in warsaw , it usually is raining as well . 
  i mean it is november . 
  [ constitution day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_3rd_constitution_day ) - 3 may . 
  marches around the country and people having bbqs because it 's a long weekend . 
  on the 1st of may we celebrate labour day ( although it 's not call labour day any more , it 's * state holiday * now ) , and the 2nd of may is a flag day , which technically is a normal working day . 
  as it 's sunny no one is fighting and it 's just much happier holiday . 
  [ armed forces day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces_day ) - 15 august . 
  well it 's a public holiday because on that day catholic church celebrates the assumption of the blessed virgin mary . 
  as it 's armed forces day there 's a big army parade in warsaw . 
  oh , why do we celebrete our armed forces day on that particular day you ask ? 
  because on that day in 1920 we kicked [ bolshevik/russian/soviet asses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 ) ) . 
  so these are official public holidays , but except that we also `` celebrate '' 4th of june - a day that our first , almost completely democratic elections after the wwii took placed in 1989 , officially it 's called the day of freedom and civil rights , but i doubt anyone knows about it . 
  31st of august - day of solidarity and freedom , set on the anniversary of august agreement from 1980 . if you 're interested in more : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_poland, 
  you 're giving it to iraq or iraqi kurds ? 
  cause iraq 's army had a lot of equipment that was given to them by us but when isis came thry just left it behind and run away ... 
   the bbc also reported that hostages had nicknamed their three captors john , paul and ringo , after members of the beatles pop group . 
  no one remembers about george : /, 
  well we could have sorted that out , but instead we accepted the prussian homage and duchy of prussia became a fief of poland . 
  acording to these statistics : [ link 1 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24636868 ) , [ link 2 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) and [ link 3 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sm.pop.refg ) , sweden accepts a lot of refugees already , especially when we look how relatively small sweden 's population is . 
  12 medals and 6th overall . 
  quiet happy with that ( although i was hopping we 're going to end up higher than germany  ) . 
  also it was a great day today . 
  amazing finish by floria guei in that 4x400m final !,
