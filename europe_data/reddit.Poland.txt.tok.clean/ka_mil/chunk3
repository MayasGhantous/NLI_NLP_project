  felt quiet bad for swiss and dutch girls in the 4x100m final ... 
  culture marxism is a fictional term created by right wing journalist and politicians . 
  the whole surrender joke is historically untrue as well :  according to the british historian niall ferguson , france has participated in 168 major european wars since 387 bc , out of which they have won 109 , drawn 10 and lost 49 : this makes france the most successful military power in european history - in terms of number of fought and won . 
  do n't show daily mail and daily express that ... 
  good that someone finally has done something , i hope it 's not to late and this madness can be stopped . 
  right now all us does is some air strikes , right ? 
  so i ca n't see how could we help them . 
  and i doubt it would turn into some kind of boots on the ground action . 
  hey , it 's not just any movie . 
  it 's a great film . 
  that monastery in armenia looks amazing . 
  always wanted to visit armenia and georgia . 
  if i grew up on a farm , and was retarded , bruges might impress me but i did n't , so it does n't . 
  can we decler reddit to be galloway-free ? 
  he 's just like zhirinovsky ... 
  if we have to do `` xxx of eu/europe '' can we at least do it once a week or something ? 
  although i got to say , that this one was actually interesting . 
  it 's not the isis flag . 
  it looks similiar but it 's not . 
   first line was opened in 2008 huh ? 
  warsaw metro was opened in 1995 . 
  independence ? 
  i thought they wanted to join serbia ? 
  it would be silly to have to serbian states right next to each other ... 
  but i do n't know enough about the situation and how likely is it for republika srbska to split from bosnia and herzegovina . 
  hopefully no one would be silly enough to start a war over it ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that there still is n't any prove that polish nobles were descended from the sarmatians . 
  or am i wrong ? 
   i feel it would make a better anthem . 
  it 's more stately and glorious . 
  i think it would only work if poland was a monarchy . 
  i always liked [ `` gaude mater polonia '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv8lrictwxe ) , but i ca n't imagine this being played during the sport events nowadays . 
  he never really played at his actually position . 
  i really hope he 's gon na stay for at least one more season . 
  i love that guy . 
  well rakoczi stabbed us in the back during the deluge . 
  so there 's that . 
  and i 'm pretty sure there were few wars between us during the medieval times . 
  there 's a plane over crimea ? 
  i thought the airspace over there was closed ? 
  first they lost they 're awesome flag in 1995 , then this . 
  how ? 
  should n't you celebrate it on 27th of july , or 25th of august ? 
  i 'm sorry but you have to be really stupid to be a polish neo-nazi after what they 've done to this country ... 
  although i can imagine this term being very loosely used in media while they 're talking about nationalists . 
  i really do n't get why those idiots would come to the uk ... 
  why on earth would wprost release this recordings ... 
  this was a private conversation and right now it only weakens poland . 
  i can imagine it being pretty hard for him to negotiate with usa now , although i would be surprised if they already knew what he thinks about them . 
  i have no idea what abw is doing there then ... 
  it all looks so amature ... 
  got to say , it was executed in a pretty bad way , but wprost had to see this coming . 
  and obviously they had to have copies so it 's not like they 're going to stop this now . 
  edit : just to make it clear , i ca n't say that i 'm happy with how this is turning out to be , it is pretty much an attack on a freedom of press . 
  not really an outrage . 
  what dod you think would happen ? 
  they have to find the source of the leak . 
  someone was recording our main politicians for a year or longer and we have no idea who it was . 
  what made them put xherdan shaqiri into croatia team ? 
  he 's was born in today 's kosovo and has dual nationality , swiss and albanian . 
  ** poland ** * so it started on wednesday , when our parliament was voting either they should lift immunity of former central anti-corruption bureau head or not . 
  no media were allowed into the parliament when he was doing his speech , in which apparently he showed some shocking evidence about our former president , aleksander kwa\u015bniewski . 
  at the end his immunity stayed intact and he wo n't be appearing in front of the court . 
  [ brief article from the warsaw voice ] ( http://www.warsawvoice.pl/wvpage/pages/article.php/28520/news ) * [ oposition wants committee to investigate property of former president ] ( http://www.warsawvoice.pl/wvpage/pages/article.php/28570/news ) * that was the main news for last few days until [ `` wprost '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wprost ) released recordings of private conversation between our interior minister and our central bank governor . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/14/us-poland-government-tape-iduskbn0ep15920140614 ) right now i do n't find them to be that shocking , although i 'm pretty sure belka stepped over the line , as he 's supposed to be apolitical , and constitution forbids him to do whatever he agreed on . 
  i just assume that conversations like this happen everyday . 
  but on monday more recordings are supposed to be released so that 's going to be interesting . 
  the change in law that was proposed in that conversation was supposed to be presented to either parliament or the government on tuesday so i 'm guessing the timing is spot on . 
  so now this is a number one news , people are calling for tusk and his government to resign and are expecting elections soon . 
  tusk is waiting till tomorrow to give a press conference . 
  edit : press release from the central bank , right now it 's only available in polish , so most of you will have to use google translate or something like that : [ link ] ( http://www.nbp.pl/home.aspx?f=/aktualnosci/wiadomosci_2014/komunikat_2014-06-15.html ), 
  really , nothing about obama 's visit and 25th anniversary of the [ 4th of june ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1989 ) ? 
  the biggest leftist party is still full of people from the old system . 
  law and justice which is in ecr has , at least in my opinion , a lot of left-wing economical views and they appeal to pensioners , unemployed and working class people . 
  then again , not so long ago , our prime minister said that he thinks he 's a social democrat . 
  before he run as a liberal and a christian democrat . 
  but yeah , sadly the society is pretty conservative . 
  this [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/slawomirdebski/status/470650740206481409 ) pretty much sums up what happened today . 
   today putin lost some ground in ukraine but won more votes in the european parliament, 
  as i live abroad , i 'm guessing i wo n't be breaking election silence ? 
  anyway it 's pretty hard to tell from the polls . 
  it looks like only 4 parties would go over the 5 % threshold , but i 'm guessing that a low turnout will work in favour of smaller , eurosceptical party , congress of the new right , and they might get 2 meps . 
  it looks like law and justice ( ecr ) and civic platform ( epp ) are very close in polls , but i 've got a feeling that some people might not admit supporting law and justice so the margine might be higher . 
  also in this case a low turnout will work in their favour as well , as their voters always go and vote . 
  so it looks like : law and justice ( ecr ) - 26 % civic platform ( epp ) - 24 % democratic left alliance -- labor union ( s&d ) - 7 % ( also how i wish these postcommunist would finally vanish from polish politics ... ) polish people 's party ( epp ) - 7 % congress of the new right ( most likely meld ) - 4 % europa plus ( s&d , few candidates would probably join alde ) - 3 % united poland ( another catholic socialists , meld ) - 3 % poland together ( they would either join epp or ecr ) - 2 % national movement ( probably would n't join any group , like front national or jobbik ) - pretty much 0/1 % greens , libertarians/pirates did n't register in all constituencies so their results will be pretty bad as well . 
  but germany does n't deny holocaust , while turkey still does denial the genocide of armenians . 
  that 's the difference . 
   29 % pis ( ecr , ultraconservative ) with some leftist economical ideas . 
  they 're basically catholic socialists . 
   armenian leave our armenian bros alone . 
  also i 'm guessing they 're protesting because turkey is still in denial about armenian genocide . 
  you can release exit polls before sunday ? 
  i thought we all have to wait till sunday evening to know the results . 
  hovedstaden we 're coming for you !, 
  hah , i wonder how confused polish conservatives have to be right now . 
  they love orban , but i 'm sure they would not support doing anything that would benefit putin . 
   updated 6/24/2010 ehm ... 
  i think it wo n't get as bad as situation in bosnia or serbia . 
  i do n't think there were any deaths in past years , and floods became pretty common in recent years . 
  i actually do n't understand how nothing is being done with it , as it seems that the same places are getting hit each year .
