  ( and yeah , i know that for example in lower silesia a lot of houses were built on floodplains , so there 's not much we can do ... ), 
   the empirical evidence for that is extremely strong show it then . 
  there 's also something called [ world games ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_games ) , but they compete in sports that are not included in the olympics . 
  who 's in charge of these game 's and why would they give it to azerbaijan ? 
  i mean they 're human rights record is horrible . 
  i know they 're rich because of the oil , but come on . 
  also basketball 3x3 ? 
  first time i 'm seeing this as an official competition . 
  also i wonder how serious will these games be taken by volleyball teams , i 'm pretty sure their calender is already busy . 
  you sure you 're not scottish ? 
  putin will be even more pissed , poland is waiting for congressional approval to buy [ jassm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-158_jassm ) . 
  their operational range is pretty impressive . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ku-2t3r8y ) will help you . 
  really ? 
  what the hell bros ? 
  at first i thought a hungarian person posted it , 
  uk , france and poland i think . 
  can you really blame us ? 
  let 's hope illarionov only seeks some attention in the press ... 
  is n't professional army cheaper , and better prepared than this ? 
  and i propose that zhirinovsky should seek some medical help . 
  do n't understand why someone would take him seriously . 
  few weeks ago he blamed poland for ww2 , in the 90 's he wanted to partition poland with germany ( again ) . 
  besides , that would be a disaster if that happened . 
  we would get the poorest regions with a a strong nationalist presence . 
  great way to destabilise a country ... 
  yeah , let 's just give putin a perfect excuse for an invasion . 
  i hope no one in estonia would be stupid enough to do something like that . 
  oh man , i got fooled :|, 
  sounds like poland . 
  for some reason i always thought that hungary 's population is bigger . 
  it just makes the duopoly of two major party stronger and people and media do n't see anything wrong with it . 
  ** poland ** mainly focusing on ukraine , what has sikorski and other european foreign ministers achieved . 
  also we 've won few new medals in sochi this week . 
  except that : - [ russia ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/162524,poland-to-lose-a-billion-euros-over-russian-pork-embargo ) and [ belarus ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/162712,belarus-blocks-polish-pork-products ) introduced embargo on polish pork . 
  wild boar was found dead and it was infected with african swine fever . 
  - [ one in five would give life for poland ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/161752,one-in-five-would-give-life-for-poland ) - there might be a upcoming debate between our pm and opposition leader . 
  other parties said their leaders should also take part in it ( and they 're right ) . 
  so we 're leaving them no choice and pushing them into putin 's hands ? 
  i can see the symbolic value of that act but i doubt it will improve the situation in ukraine ... 
  well you guys tried : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_autonomous_oblast, 
  i acually think it was either brezhnev or khrushchev that suggested to keep kaliningrad . 
  and that line was drawn later on , originally it was supposed to look like that ( blue line ) : http://historia-wyzynaelblaska.pl/images/granica_pol_sow_pw.png, 
  university of k\u00f6nigsberg , or * uniwersytet albertyna * was a pretty important univeristy for poland . 
  of course the city was never actually part of the crown but yeah , it 's not just the name . 
  apparently at first it was supposed to be given to poland , but someone realised that it would probably be a good idea to have a ice-free port , so soviet union kept it . 
   in 16th century , the grand duchy of lithuania was the biggest state in europe , so here you go * cough cough * polish-lithuanian commonwealth * cough cough * looks nice though , definitely wanting to visit it some day . 
   1 ) every party flocking in the middle of the political spectrum - what 's wrong with that ? 
  you 're keeping the extremists out , which is good in my opinion . 
  oh come on , france is stealing our two elements . 
  ( radium and polonium ), 
   ivano-frankivsk oblast also , apparently in ivano-frankivsk oblast they started using red and black flags of oun-b and upa as official symbols ... 
  i do n't know how i feel about this , especially as there is a strong support from poland for the ukrainian protesters . 
  have you been following the news in last few months ? 
  also ukraine is n't even an official candidate yet so they wo n't be next . 
  my guess would have been iceland but if i 'm not wrong their new government is n't interested in joining the eu . 
  next closest is montenegro , but i 'm guessing we 're probably going to wait awhile now , as there 's a lot of problems and issues within the union that should be sorted out . 
  anyway this link will help you out : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union, 
   it 's mostly a holdover from the period when labour was actually a leftist party ; european integration has always been heavily associated with the socialist end of the political spectrum in the uk . 
  hmm , i thought the old labour was against eu , there 's this diehard socialist mp who 's totally against eu . 
  was n't it the conservative governmant that got you guys into the eu in the first place ? 
  poland * ukraine * [ more details of secret cia prison in poland revealed ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/159745,more-details-of-secret-cia-prison-in-poland-revealed ) * [ polish pope 's personal documents to be published against his wishes ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/159145,polish-popes-personal-documents-to-be-published-against-his-wishes ) * oppoistion tried to get rid of the minister of health , but they lost again . 
  * in sports : our handball team finished euro 2014 in the 6th place . 
  lukasz kubot and his swedish partner robert lindstedt have won the final of the men 's doubles at the australian open in melbourne and agnieszka radwa\u0144ska lost a semi final to dominika cibulkova . 
  half of them looks like olof mellberg . 
  are you guys cloning him or something ? 
  ** poland ** * so 25 years ago all death sentences were turned into 25-year in prison sentences because something like life sentence did n't exist in polish law back then . 
  so now all those people are coming out and no one bother to fix it through the entire time . 
  [ this is probably the case that got the most attention ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/158945,freed-paedophile-murderer-will-be-monitored ) * [ poland rises in economic freedom index ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/158747,poland-rises-in-economic-freedom-index ) - but i think it 's mainly because other countries did worse than poland . 
  * [ italian comic honours holocaust whistleblower jan karski ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/11/artykul/158713,italian-comic-honours-holocaust-whistleblower-jan-karski ) - probably did n't get much attention in media but i think it deserves to be mentioned * [ the first face transplant to be carried out in poland has been declared the world 's best example of reconstructive surgery of 2013 by the american society for reconstructive microsurgery . 
  ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/158797,first-polish-face-transplant-wins-us-honour ) * [ opposition leader blasts ` hurtful stereotypes ' of poles in uk ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/158938,opposition-leader-blasts-\u2018hurtful-stereotypes\u2019-of-poles-in-uk ), 
   leftist parties cemented their election coalition , basically taking in everyone from 4 parties ( some non-existent now due to former failures ) to maximize their rather slim chances of electoral victory . 
  they are basically this [ 7 ] . 
  only a section of the green party did n't join . 
  is n't that your former pm who said he 's been lying to the public for 2 years in this picture ? 
  why would someone vote form him ? 
  :| what about lmp , are they in this weird coalition against orban ? 
  crown and crown jewels were melted by germans . 
  frederick william iii of prussia lost a war with napoleon so he was broke and decided to melt them . 
   lithuania and poland were previously independent monarchies as well , but because of the elective nature of succession , i do n't think there could be a legitimate claimant to either . 
  there could be . 
  the constitution of may 3rd introduced changes and elective monarchy would have ended . 
  after king poniatowski 's death frederick augustus i of saxony and his dynasty was supposed to take over . 
  but as we know that did not happen ... 
  there were some talks about introducing monarch in the interwar period but i do n't think any names were mentioned . 
  currently there are some small monarchists groups and also some crazy people that clam their right and wear stuff like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/warszawa%2c_marsz_niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci_2011%2c_marek_\u015awi\u0119tope\u0142k_\u015awiatope\u0142k-zawadzki.jpg ) . 
  so you 're not a nationalist , you 're just a patriot . 
  i 'm in the uk and i 'm voting for lib dems . 
  do n't they just have the most liberal immigration laws in europe , while the rest of us is trying to tighten the rules ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it was sweden that welcomed the most of iraqi refugees after saddam was overthrown . 
  ( although there is a longer history of iraqi people moving to sweden ), 
  mainly battle of vienna and patrision of poland , how people lived in austrian partition , how backwards was galicia , but compering to prussia and russia poles had more freedom there and as far as i know there was no attempts similar to germanisation or russification . 
  also there was a lot of talk about austria when we covered age of enlightenment . 
  i remember that maximilian iii was fighting with sigismund iii vasa over who 's going to be a king of poland after king batory died . 
  and i 'm pretty sure few other member 's of the house of habsburg tried to get our crown but they always lost in the election . 
  except that in art and music classes we learnt about mozart , haydn , vienna secession . 
  belarus , western ukraine , czech republic , slovakia and hungary :d, 
  i find it funny that there 's no representation of wales in it , but there is a harp that 's representing ireland . 
  hmm , either [ tryumfy kr\u00f3la niebieskiego ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz4cxntghyo ) or [ mizerna , cicha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no7zlnwswug ) .
