  please no ... 
   we celebrate every year that we lost a war . 
  you would love poland then . 
  i do n't know , when i think about autonomy movements in france the only one that comes to mind is the one from corsica . 
  i 'm pretty sure rest of those movements are very , very small and have almost no chance of accomplishing their goal . 
  there is no way that entire \u015al\u0105sk / silesia would separate . 
  this movement only exist in upper silesia , so opole and wroc\u0142aw would still remain within poland . 
  also i 'm pretty sure there 's no autonomy/independence movement in bretony .

  so who 's the new guy , what can we expect from him ? 
  if i remember correctly georgian pm had some unclear connections in russia ? 
  where the majority was polish and jewish , and lithuanians did n't even make 10 % of the population back then . 
  raciborskie or \u017bywe for me . 
  from the most popular ones i prefer \u017bywiec over tyskie . 
  and here cgp grey explains it as well : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu, 
  biggest european economy , biggest population in eu , doing relatively well during the crisis . 
  it would be silly not to follow these elections . 
  why would you guys elect him ? 
  what the hell denmark , i thought you knew better . 
   but i 'm guessing he 's just the only one and venstre is n't full of people like him ? 
   911 truther what 's that ? 
  was he one of those conspiracy theories people , that think usa did it ? 
  i got that guy pretty high as well . 
  * alde - 67 % * ecr - 60 % * epp - 60 % * gue/ngl - 53 % * efd - 47 % * s&d - 47 % * greens/efa - 33 % a bit suprised how high ecr is . 
  my best national party match were folkpartiet liberalerna ( sweden ) , venstre ( denmark ) , fdp from germany and ... slovak nationalists . 
  no idea how i got them so high . 
  would n't australia benefit from this ? 
  that desert could turn into something usable . 
  the rest of us though ... 
  so if i was german , pirate party would be the closest to me : http://i.imgur.com/snxhwpn.png . 
  always thought that i 'm more fdp kind of guy . 
   general unpopularity of centrists in an increasingly polarised europe . 
  which is very , very sad . 
  imo i doubt much will change , epp will probably still be the biggest group . 
  if i 'm not wrong barroso 's term is over soon as well and epp and s&d will have some candidates for his position as well ? 
  the guardian . 
  they probably thought that more people will read it . 
  i did n't change it as many news related subreddits have a rule that does n't allow editorialize titles ( which i think is a good rule ) . 
   according to the british historian niall ferguson , france has participated in 168 major european wars since 387 bce , out of which it won 109 , drawn 10 and lost 49 , making the country the most successful military power in european history . 
  being a memeber of nato is more important in this case . 
  what about that black-yellow-white flag you used to have during the empire times ? 
  was n't that the main flag for the while ? 
  there were restrictions for lithuania in the uk ? 
  i think this cartoon was made in the response to labour 's latest statement that they got their policies wrong back in 2004 and complaining about tesco and next , that are hiring mostly migrant workers , not british people . 
  whoes line is it anyway was a british show bro . 
  `` big issue please ? '', 
  wliia is actually older than mock the week , first episode was aired in 1988 . 
  also wliia is n't based around the news like mock the week is . 
  things worse than greek economy, 
  cricket is such a fascinating sport . 
  things that are unlikely to be heard at nigel farage 's party . 
  guilty pleasure of us all . 
  what about the armenian genocide ? 
   and the third probably would be \u017beligowski 's mutiny majority of the population of vilnus its region was polish so there 's that . 
  but yeah , that pretty much screwed up the relations with lithuania back then and probably still does . 
   ( currently gazeta wyborcza ) they buy ads in wyborcza because it 's a well known and established title and it sells pretty well compared to other papers . 
  there 's no conspiracy to favourite them over some right wing weekly magazine that was established not so long ago ...  there is a huge movement in poland to change election system , i suggest you to contact them http://jow.pl/kontakt/ fpp is an outdated system that does n't really work nowadays . 
  you can see how skewed it is in britain , when lib dems got 23 % of votes , but only won 57 seats . 
  electoral reform is needed but we should move to a system used either in australia , ireland or even germany , which in my opinion are much fairer than the current system . 
  wow , is this really that common across our part of europe ? 
  we do have similar attitude ... 
  this kind of illustrates it : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2sedtlirwu ( in polish though ), 
  yeah , after submitting my last comment i realised that people probably lied about stds as well . 
  what 's with the stds infections in scandinavia ( and finland ) ? 
  one night stands are pretty `` popular '' in other countries as well , but stds numbers are much lower .
