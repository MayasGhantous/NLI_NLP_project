  for example [ polish ambassador to israel has been summoned to foreign ministry in jerusalem to explain the vote in parliament ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/141551,israel-summons-polish-ambassador-over-kosher-ban ) . 
  * new polls : [ law and justice is still ahead of civic platform and would win the next elections . 
  ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/141595,opposition-with-six-point-lead-over-ruling-party ) * i think this got a lot of coverage as well : [ progressive priest agrees to vacate parish ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/141457,progressive-priest-agrees-to-vacate-parish ) . 
  * also some people got a bit angry after barcelona cancelled their friendly match in gda\u0144sk with lechia , after vilanova 's resignation . 
  that 's why people really should stop posting them a day before , or at midnight . 
  ca n't mods set up a bot or something , so this thread would show up automatically every sunday morning ? 
   there is now a republican movement i 'm pretty sure you can read statements like this every time some major event happens that involves royal family . 
  same stuff happened during the royal wedding or the jubilee last year . 
   soccer & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; football bro , football . 
   volynia tragedy is promoted nowdays for the very same reason . 
  have to degree . 
  it 's `` promoted '' because 70th anniversary happens this year . 
  it 's also been pretty much forgotten till recently , not many people know what happened , who killed who . 
  we can not build good , stable relations without confronting our past . 
  also , it kind of hurts , when our side is doing a lot to make those relations better and then yushchenko names bandera a national hero on his last day of presidency . 
  bros in hosting euro 2012 corruption volhynia and eastern galicia massacres lviv used to be a pretty important city for polish and jewish culture holodomor better football team than ours , and also their clubs do better in european competitions than ours pretty messed up politics and it seems like it wo n't change for a while, 
   polish is there some kind of general feeling over it ? 
  i just read that even we lost it during the partitions , the polish influences were still pretty strong till latvia got its independence 1918 . 
  there 's a new theory which says that mieszko was a moravian prince , that was a christian from birth and he moved to greater poland later , when great morvia was failing . 
  so we start with ancient romans and greeks . 
  the origins of poland , battles with germans , covering few important kings , then we have a new dynasty and union with grand duchy of lithuania and how we kicked teutonic order 's asses in battle of grunwald . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth , how the union worked , wars we had with sweden , ottoman empire , russians . 
  we talked about weaknesses of the state and we moved to more depressing stuff like partitions . 
  constitution of 3rd may is a pretty big deal , same as french revolution . 
  later we cover all the uprisings that happened , how we fought to keep our identity under german , austrian and russian rule . 
  a bit about first world war , but i felt that it was usually left out . 
  the we talk about getting the independence back , how the government was formed , battle of warsaw in 1920 . 
  october revolution is mentioned as well . 
  then it goes on how second republic worked , a lot about pi\u0142sudski and his coup . 
  moving on we get more stuff about germany as well , especially after hitler come to power . 
  and the ww2 happens and we learn a lot about it . 
  i mean a lot . 
  which is good but then we usually run out of time so there is not much time to cover what happened after the war in poland . 
  wars in korea , vietnam are briefly mentioned . 
  some stuff about cold war , strikers in poland , hungary , czechoslovakia , solidarity and martial law in 1981 , but it 's all pretty brief in my opinion . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** romans , greek , battle of grunwald , polish-lithuanian commonwealth , how big we were , partition of poland , constitution , uprisings , second republic and ww2 . 
  not much emphasize on ww1 and what happened after the ww2 . 
  ** edit : ** i forgot , but there 's a lot of emphasize on how [ tolerant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation ) polish-lithuanian commonwealth was , how it was reffered to as `` the state without stakes '' , that jews emigrated here from other european counties and how many poles risked their lives to save jewish people during ww2 . 
  i got really confused for a moment . 
  i thought julio bashmore was in poland or something ... 
  well that deal is not good for us at all . 
  poor cornwall , always left out . 
  great tennis players . 
  ( yes , i 'm watching djokovi\u0107 right now ), 
  sikorski , who was granted an asylum status in uk in the 80s , already said no . 
  well he knew he ca n't go there but still tried to walk next to ma mosque , which could rise some tensions as police was saying . 
  also they knew that charity wo n't accept their money . 
  not saying that arresting him was the best way to deal with it . 
  yeah , that works better . 
  ( yeah , i know you 're gon na say that 's basically fascism ), 
   this disgusting faschist orb\u00e1n is in the eu . 
  he was elected by hungarian people , i 'm not a fan of his , but you have to respect their vote . 
  also calling him a fascist is a cheap shot . 
  oh you know , that german tv series ... 
  in politics : civic platform is in trouble . 
  * their polls are getting worse , pm approval rating it 's pretty bad , only 26 % of people thinks he 's doing a good job . 
  it 's even worse when it comes to government as a whole , according to tns polska , 79 % of people thinks their doing a bad job . 
  in other poll , done by cbos , that number is a bit lower , it 's 67 % . 
  * most likely there will be a referendum in warsaw to get rid of a current mayor , who is one of the main po politicians . 
  that would happened in october if i 'm not wrong . 
  * that already happened in [ elbl\u0105g ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbl\u0105g ) . 
  [ elections are happening there right now . 
  ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/139144,national-politicians-campaign-ahead-of-key-local-election ) * adding to all that there was an issue with how parties spend their money , as they got most of it from the budget . 
  recently there was an article about po spending it on wine and cigars . 
  then a news dropped about them buying a dress for pm 's wife . 
  * senate could n't decided for a while on a resolution about [ volhynian slaughter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
  but at the end they [ came to an agreement ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/139153,senate-ukrainian-wwii-massacres-of-poles-bear-hallmarks-of-genocide ) . 
  * also lewandowski got married , so tabloids are having a blast . 
  i want to conquer poland after listening to wagner . 
  that changes so often , i remember berlin being called that . 
  prague was popular for a while as well if i 'm not wrong . 
  now they 're all too mainstream . 
   the biggest crime since the holocaust . 
  ohhh , that 's a touchy subject today in / r/europe , 
  well \u017bywio\u0142ak are influenced by pre-christian tales , rituals and legends . 
  so they might not be a typical polish folk band . 
  but yeah , most songs by brathanki are like this . 
  oh , i got interested in balkan music after this album was released in poland : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoton and then felt in love with this song : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfi3egxkzh8, 
  the fuss started before , when it aired in germany . 
  right wing journalist went crazy , from the beginning . 
  i know that ambassador in germany complained to zdf about it , but i 'm glad tvp aired it . 
  it gives people a chance to make their own mind about it , also were n't there some discussion panel after each episode ? 
  [ \u017bywio\u0142ak - noc kupa\u0142y ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1neyaez6ue ) [ brathanki - czerwone korale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tep-t9onubw ) - yeah , probably a guilty pleasure . 
  there waa a time when folk-rock-pop bands like this were popular in poland . 
  i think it still counts ? 
  also sometimes i listen to this hungarian song , [ k\u00e1rp\u00e1tia - abb\u00f3l a f\u00e1b\u00f3l ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xesumuo4x-s ) . 
  do n't know much about the band , i hope i 'm not listening to hungarian rac , am i ? 
  anything with bregovi\u0107 in it is fine by me . 
  that community is so bad , apparently main problem in poland right now is islam and muslims , and how they 're taking over europe . 
  the problem with this ? 
  there 's like 30000 muslims in poland . 
  most of them claim to be all for freedom , liberalism , until the topic is about muslims , gays , feminists or jews . 
  most comments will `` give you cancer '' over there . 
  it 's not even funny any more . 
  because we still got some idiots on the right side who know that playing on emotions , clamming that germans are trying to change the history etc will give their papers better sales . 
  the whole outrage started again because polish national tv aired it recently , and that 's apparently bad . 
  maybe they were , maybe were n't . 
  there is no way ak , a huge formation could be portrayed that way . 
   speaking about `` polish concentration camps '' true . 
  anyone should be outraged about it , especially if it happens in media such as der spiegiel , new york times , die welt or german national tv .
