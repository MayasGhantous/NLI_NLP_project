  i 'm pretty sure few french papers used that term , and so did wall street journal . 
   speaking about `` nazis '' instead of `` germans '' i see the point they making , personally i would jump on that bandwagon . 
   any sort of discussion about modern or historical polish antisemitism , especially if anyone involved is german true , especially that antisemitism was visible in the entire europe before the war . 
  but these people now think that there is a plan of changing the history , so most people would start to associated us with the antisemitism , holocaust , and only us . 
  i already have to go through that sometimes while living in the uk , because `` schindler 's list '' showed something like that . 
  also people feel that while we are getting blamed for some incidents , world is forgetting about many people who were risking their lives during the ww2 to save jews . 
   any sort of discussion about german expellees from the so called recovered territories ( parts of germany that were incorporated into poland after wwii ) and then some may say that they were part of poland before germans took them , and we can go back and forth with arguments like this . 
  a ) they were running away from red army , as we all know how germans were treated by them . 
  b ) new borders were n't drawn by us , but by stalin . 
  there is still some fear that their descendants can come back and claim that land back , and people do n't think that 's fair . 
  and i understand that . 
  no , but it portrayed [ armia krajowa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armia_krajowa ) as bunch of uncivilised antisemites in few places . 
  oh yeah , but tusk really is n't that liberal when it comes to social issues . 
  also i did n't know romania wants to join the visegrad group . 
   nathalie kosciusko-morizet won the ump 's primaries for the municipal election in paris first we sent our plumbers , now we 're taking over paris . 
   but i 'm guessing as it 's a capital , and it 's paris , left is stronger there than conservatives ? 
  recently there was an interview with ponta in polish press , he said he want 's to `` copy '' poland , so i though he would be more like tusk , not orban . 
  ( here 's a link , it 's in polish , but maybe google translate can do a good job : http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,14053052,premier_ponta____rumunia_chce_byc_jak_polska.html ), 
  kashubians are , there is/was a debate about silesians being considered an ethnic minority , getting an autonomy , like they had before the ww2 , but it 's not going very far and i doubt it would happen very soon . 
  both of them do n't really need guaranteed seats . 
  they 're the biggest minority , you can see how big is the difference between german minority and belarusians : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_poland#demography, 
  * some floods in the south , but no where as bad as in germany , austria or czech republic * [ storms over poland ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/137860,storms-hammer-poland-but-neighbours-bear-brunt ) * [ warsaw metro is flooded , four stations are closed ( links in polish ) ] ( http://tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl/informacje,news,zalalo-metro-w-stolicy-br-cztery-stacje-sa-wylaczone,90012.html ) * [ former communist leader cleared of martial law charges ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/137450,former-communist-leader-cleared-of-martial-law-charges ) , which is pissing me off . 
  * there was some recent visit of eu officials in china and we all know what happened there on [ 4th of june in 1989 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiananmen_square_protests_of_1989 ) . 
  one of the officials that went there is a marshal of polish sejm , [ ewa kopacz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewa_kopacz ) . 
  there were talks if this visit was appropriate at this time . 
  * another thing that happened on 4th of june in 1989 were our first , [ almost free elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1989 ) . 
  [ it 's kind of celebrated as freedom day nowadays . 
  ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/137510,poland-celebrates-historic-june-1989-elections ) * our national football team is crap , they drew with moldova and our chances of going to brazil next year are very small . 
  * one mp left our biggest opposition party , he 's forming a new movement that will be a republican movement , small government , socially conservative , free market and all . 
  so he really did n't fit into law and justice anyway , as i 'd like to call them catholic socialists . 
  they are talks that some conservative mps from civic platform might join him , but we 'll see what happens after a leadership election within the party . 
  also nationalists are forming a new movement , all of those little organisations will get into one , but i really doubt they could get into parliament any time soon . 
   the chamber of deputies will have 300 members plus the 17 for national minorities ( 1 for each ) . 
  right now it 's 18 national minorities , who 's going to lose it ? 
  also that 's pretty impressive , there 's only one , or two guaranteed seats in polish sejm for german minority and you guys have 18 plus udmr as well .

  how the hell greeks would not culturally be european ? 
  european culture is strongly influenced by ancient greek and roman culture ... 
  as many people said , never met an armenian , but i know they have been part of poland 's history at least from 14th century . 
  i know that s\u0142owacki , herbert and penderecki are of armenian origins . 
  to be honest , from all of the countries of caucasus , georiga is a better known in poland . 
  yep , frederick william iii was a dick . 
  prime minister . 
  j\u00e1nos \u00c1der is the president of hungary .

  oh and also the minster of justice changed , he has been replaced by another conservative politician but new guy should n't make any troubles to the prime minister this time . 
  german law does n't allow to do expermients on german embryos , or at least that 's how he was explaining it . 
  he got sacked today , he was replaced by another conservative , [ marek biernacki . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marek_biernacki ), 
  * [ crisis in the coalition ] ( http://thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/133894,coalition-hits-deepest-crisis ) * loads of stuff about smole\u0144sk crash , recently one of the main politicans of the biggest opposition party said that 3 people survived .

  also cba means [ central anticorruption bureau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_anticorruption_bureau ), 
   fran\u00e7ois bayrou oh i remember him . 
  he was representing liberals in last year 's elections , was n't he ? 
  i find it quite funny that social democrats implemented austerity in iceland and centre right is now talking about putting more money into healthcare and social benefits system . 
  any icelandic redditors here ? 
  how did you guys vote ? 
  seems like two eurosceptic parties will form a coalition so how do you guys feel about your accession to eu ? 
  do you even want to be in it ? 
  schulz and zapatero ? 
  hell no . 
  is zapatero even popular in spain ? 
  also does a list like these , regarding epp exist anywhere ? 
  i would be interested to look at potential names . 
  37 % unemployment rate in andalusia ? 
  what the hell : o, 
  if schulz would be pes candidate , i would have to vote for someone representing epp instead of alde . 
  i do n't know much about italian politics . 
  as he 's that old , could he resign in a year or two ? 
  after the mess in your parliamentary politics is over ? 
  also how much power does a president have in italy ? 
  and why most of them are quite old ? 
   and invading the islands of 3rd world countries . 
  if you 're still reffering to falklands it would be good if you would actually know the history of those islands . 
  the truth is that argentina owned them for very short period of time : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rubnsmifr5m/uovsqwfbh_i/aaaaaaaaa10/em2i6qaihmg/s0/falklands.permanence.png, 
  what 's that diaspora mentality you 're talking about ? 
  france was opposed as well . 
  it makes sense , weaker germany would probably be better for both sides . 
  [ this comes to mind first ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7cg_aizbu ) :( also some stuff about ww2 that i 'm not going to bring up now  beyond that not much , i 'd love to visit riga one day . 
  btw i do n't remember where i read this , but apparently you really like poles over there . 
  do n't know if that 's an urban legend or not . 
  maybe some stuff that nuts on the right like to spread , i used to follow few of their blogs few years ago . 
  i just remember reading something about this . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017beligowski's_mutiny http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania majority of people living there were polish , if i 'm not wrong there were more jewish people than lithuanians living in this region . 
  so it 's not as clear as their trying to present it . 
  apparently when usrr collapsed people in lithuania were worried that poland would want to take the land back and invade the country . 
  we did n't have colonies but france was trying to sell madagascar to us in the 30 's . 
  i wonder if that would work and how would it look like after the ww2 . 
  except that i 'm pretty sure we tried something in liberia around that time , but well , western europe was n't happy about it , making it harder to trade for us , blocking our ships etc.
