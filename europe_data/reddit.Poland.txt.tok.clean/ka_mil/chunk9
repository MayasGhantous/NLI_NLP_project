   all the sunny countries hate the uk . 
  what about portugal ? 
  you guys love each other !, 
   oh do n't take that to heart , it was a fairly lighthearted comment and not about the retaking of vilnius so much as the underhand tactics used . 
  oh yeah i know , just pointing it out , so people will get a wider perspective on population in vilnius back then . 
    indeed , i ca n't say my polish friends have ever been more than polite to lithuanians , and vice versa about my lithuanian friends . 
  it saddens me , cause because of our history , we should be closer allies , but on the other hand i 'm not trying to be a dick to any lithuanian that i meet here in the uk . 
  i 'm not denying it , but many of these places changed `` hands '' a lot . 
  there a dispute over a silesia , and should some people living be considered a minority , right wingers are going nuts whenever it 's mentioned , but the truth is , silesia was once polish , once czech and once german . 
  gda\u0144sk was also a part of royal prussia which was a part of poland . 
  in my first post i only referred to wilno/vilnus , as it was n't really a lithuanian city and the war over it was n't pointless , or fact of poles just being `` naughty '' or `` greedy '' . 
  i know it will probably divide poles and lithuanians for some time , but it should stop both sides from cooperating like poland does with germany , and in my opinion we 're in quite good relations with germans , which i ca n't say about polish relations with lithuania in recent years . 
  gda\u0144sk was a weird one , it was n't trully polish , or german at the time . 
  in 1930 's only about 13 % of the population was polish . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_city_of_danzig we did n't get wroc\u0142aw until after the war , and pozna\u0144 was always a polish city . 
  and the east did n't get a lot and the division between western poland and eastern poland increased . 
  i think that can be considered a loss . 
  what cities are you referring to ? 
  [ that 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_poznan#area_and_population ) the only data i can find right now , about western parts that we got in 1918 , but they were always polish . 
  edit : acctually a better link , i forgot that grand duchy of poznan was dissolved : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/province_of_posen#religious_and_ethnic_conflicts, 
  i 'm surprised but it seems to be true , however the article is from 2009 , and unfortunately i 've got only google translate version for non-polish speakers : http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.money.pl/archiwum/wiadomosci/artykul/73%3b3%3bmld%3bzl%3bdotacji%3b-%3bsprawdz%3bkto%3bdostal%3bnajwiecej,194,0,446146.html&amp;usg=alkjrhizw5dr_qoeqojabed1g2ch7dclfa, 
  i consider po to be a centrist party , with an addition of christian democrats and few liberals , but they 're not really strong within the party . 
  i think the issue was more of the fact that german people who left territories that poland gained after the war , could come back and clam their land back . 
  i think that was the main reason in regions such as mazury and lower silesia . 
  acctually i 'm curious , does [ federation of expellees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation_of_expellees ) or how you would probably call it bund der vertriebenen , get a lot of media attention in germany , or does polish media and politicians exaggerated the issue ? 
  most of this part of prussia was taken from poland during the [ partitions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  so they really have n't lost their land . 
   wow , poland was naughty . 
  you may say that , but the fact is that poles were the majority in vilnius back then , lithuanians made only 2.6 % population of the city . 
  i was wondering why are we in this , i undestand polish and french historical ties , and that france used to be a place where many poles emigrated there during the partitions times , but it 's still looks pretty weird . 
   i would personally like to see germany be the main military superpower of europe . 
  no thanks . 
  yeah , but finding work after graduation is probably hard ... 
  i have n't followed that story long enough , what fiscal cliff actually is ? 
  is it something similar to what happened during clinton 's presidency , when federal government practically shut down for a while because they could n't get a compromise between democrats and republicans ? 
  am i the only one who likes `` never gon na give you up '' ? 
   a tv station might be a good idea euronews ? 
  well if easter europe is n't good enough for you , [ fine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmccc.gif ) . 
  you still trying to get into nordic club , huh ? 
  i think sweden just does n't want ot be a part of eurozone just yet ? 
  if they wanted , they 're already would be in . 
  same goes to denmark . 
  swedes had a referendum and they said no , and it seems that they 're still would say no : http://www.businessinsider.com/swedens-euro-hostility-hits-a-record-2012-12, 
  it 's not quiet clear if today 's lithuania can be call a heir of grand duchy of lithuania , i think belarus has an equal rights to this . 
  czech rep , slovakia , hungary , belarus and ukraine . 
  no they should not . 
  they have the same right to be there as lithuanias , and as germans living in poland . 
  this region was multinational , multicultural for years and it only changed after wwii . 
  i know there is a huge disagreement over \u017beligowski 's mutiny and other stuff , but as it 's history we should move on and sort the future out . 
  i just looked it up , and it seems like the coalition that won the election is made out of social democrats , liberals , and conservatives ? 
  how does that work ? 
  and their opposition was an alliance of conservatives and christian democrats ? 
  i know ideology is n't a big thing nowadays , but how are they suppose to govern when they 're should be some huge differences within the coalition ? 
  or is this conservative party only conservative by name ? 
  you just went full retarded . 
  too bad he does n't seem to care about polish minority on lithuania , or belarus . 
  that 's where the rights should be equal . 
  the only part i understood was `` sikorski '' . 
  i do n't understand , you voted no because of the cultural links ? 
  it 's not like voting yes means you 're anti-israeli . 
  why was ukraine absent ? 
   right-wing afd have n't they split few months ago and people who established the party wanting to create a new conservative party ? 
  i read something about afd being hijacked by pegida people and that being a reason for people leaving . 
  go back to / r/european, 
  cry me a river . 
  v4 has been dead since it achieved its goal , joined the eu in 2004 . 
  from that point it did n't have any purpose . 
  it 's not like there 's a great solidarity between the four countries anyway . 
  just last year , when poland was an outspoken supporter of ukraine hungary was making deals with putin and slovakia and the czech republic were calling for an end , or lighter sanctions on russia . 
  our government says it 's got what it wanted in these negotiation and let 's be honest , 10k of the refugees is the least that poland can do . 
  if we want to be big guys in the eu , and everyone seems to think that we 're almost there , let 's act like it . 
   what , is the polish government going to be reelected too ? 
  i hope so . 
  not really a fan of the idea . 
  australian camps in papua new guinea or christmas island come to my mind and they 're awful . 
   and in its beginning berlin was a slavic settlement no it was not . 
  slavic settlements were long time gone by the time berlin , as we know it , was established . 
  let 's just bring back the weekly thread where everyone posted in their own langauge , make it that it has to be dual-language so everyone can take part in the discussion and everyone would be happy . 
  that guy was fighting against daesh : http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-leader-seeks-europe-fleeing-govt-jihadis-163636165.html, 
  it only take place in 5 cities but they needed 4 countries to host it ? 
  not gon na pretend that i know much about european basketball but it looks like we won out first game , you go poland !, 
  obviously some of it is easier said than done ( `` end the war in syria '' , `` end the war in libya '' , `` end repression and extremism in eritrea and afghanistan '' ) but something like a standard asylum procedure across europe is a no-brainer to me , but obviously it ca n't be as liberal as it is in for example sweden , because rest of the union wo n't agree to it , but it 's a known fact that some asylum seekers are trying to get to specific counitres because they have a better chances of becoming refugees there ( an example that i 've used few times in this subreddit , eritreans that want to apply for assylum in the uk instead of france because france rejects most of their applications ) . 
  eu should also follow cameron 's idea of getting refugees from the camps in jordan , lebanon and turkey . 
  it could stop some people from trying to get to europe on the boats and save lives . 
  also there was already one war in lebanon caused by a refugee crisis , how much longer can they last ? 
  i 'm glad that the gurdian is mentioning gulf countries , but i do n't know how could we achieve that ? 
  resubmitted here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jquws/10_ways_to_manage_the_migration_crisis/, 
  i do n't see the edit option , can you change it ? 
  that 's the proper link : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/10-ways-to-manage-the-migration-crisis, 
  less than 2 % moved to europe , most refugees are in turkey , lebanon , or jordan . 
  ok so it might be different around europe then , because i 'm pretty sure that this is how it works in poland , after you become a refugee , instead of an asylum seeker you pretty much get the same rights as normal citizens . 
  i would have to look around for sources again . 
  i thought that was a part of the refugee convention that everyone signed . 
  but yeah , getting a job as a refugee seems to be difficult , ca n't argue with that . 
  ha , i love that accent and \u0141 's , too bad no one talks like that any more . 
  because german law clearly explains who qualifies to be a national minority in germany . 
  poles are n't because pretty much everyone emigrated there , either in the 19th century , or in the 20th century . 
  there 's only 4 national minorities that get some special treatment in germany , danes , sorbs , frisians and german roma people . 
  if i 'm not wrong if you get a refugee status you 're automatically get a work permit . 
  you 've got the same rights as other citizens .
