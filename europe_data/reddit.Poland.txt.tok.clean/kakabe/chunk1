of course not, 
  polish - native , english - c1/c2 , german - b2 , italian - b1, 
  ahoj , more knedliki please !, 
  you forgot poland, 
  well `` spindleshanks '' is not that bad compared to [ `` wrymouth '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boles%c5%82aw_iii_wrymouth ) , 
  how about dukes mieszko iv tanglefoot or w\u0142adys\u0142aw iii spindleshanks ? 
   our allies would gladly share the needed technology all would be eager to sell their systems , but it is not likely , that they would just share their technology . 
  it is all about business . 
  there is a polish project http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,1033795,title,mon-chce-budowac-tarcze-wisla-i-odnowic-polska-zbrojeniowke,wid,16747053,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=11359a the problem is the lack of proper technology and money to invest in its development, 
  oh , i 'm just sad . 
  polan is proud of you ; _ ;, 
  just some friendly advice, 
   poland has its own share of opt outs too , for example they are one of the few countries not participating in the unified divorce system . 
  unified divorce system was created within the enhanced cooperation procedure , so you ca n't say that countries that did n't participate in it , have an opt-out . 
  drunk ( former ) polish president aleksander kwa\u015bniewski gives a lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdghj2kgj8 some best phrases : `` now i will say something in french : `` savoire vivre '' `` you should look into women 's eyes '' `` the question is whether the time flows faster than we think '', 
  perhaps they 're having a * beef * with does and deers, 
  if the results are as in the prediction , who will rule the uk ? 
  could labour party become the ruling party ? 
  is coaltion with snp possible to any party ? 
  vwadiswav  ) or better : vuadisuav . 
  it would be easier using a phonetic alphabet, 
  it 's not that strange , it 's like voi in french , 
  we spell `` w '' like germans - it 's a `` v '' sound, 
  still he gave dyneburg ( daugavpils ) to latvia , although he could keep it for poland :3 edit : that comment was relating to prometheian doctrine principles  the purpose of the promethean enterprise was to liberate from imperialist russia , of whatever political stripe , the peoples of the baltic , black and caspian sea basins and to create a series of independent states as a common defensive front against russian aggression when lithuanian friend protested i realised that it could be misunderstood easily , and added a comment mentioning \u017beligowski 's coup . 
  auguri !, 
  that 's what i mentioned above . 
  ok , i fooled myself here , \u017beligowski , vilnius ... 
  nevertheless those actions were n't the part of prometheian doctrine, 
   besides the focal ceremonies , noted historians including professor norman davies and professor w\u0142adys\u0142aw bartoszewski will take part in a debate at westerplatte on 7 may . 
  that 's sad that w\u0142adys\u0142aw bartoszewski passed away today ... 
  oh no , supporting nations under tsar 's / soviet occupation . 
  what a deadly sin . 
  `  ` look german sounds wrong, 
   in poland we go : `` screw it , i 'm going in '' `` a wild policeman appears '', 
  i was just quoting wiki to show that poles would rather not be sad because of his passing . 
  i agree , it has been oversimplified and does n't show the proper meaning . 
  i was n't aware of it . 
  ( still uncle bismarck was n't a likeable guy for us ) however i do n't agree with the statement that he could have thought that  a strong polish state is dangerous for germany . 
  there was no polish state and position of poles was significantly weak then . 
  poland-lithuania was a past construct , even in bismarck times . 
  and as addition , sth quite funny  micha\u0142 drzyma\u0142a is a polish folk hero because , after he was denied permission to build a house on his own land ( only because he was polish ) by the prussian authorities in the village of kaisertreu , he bought a circus wagon and turned it into his home . 
  at the time , prussian law considered any dwelling a house if it remained stationary for more than 24 hours . 
  drzyma\u0142a use the mobility of the wagon to exploit the law and to avoid the negative consequences by moving the wagon each day and thus preventing the prussians the ability to penalize him, 
  the lands that belonged to germany should have been populated by the germans . 
  easy as that , become germanised or ... 
  the very german thing was that they were doing it by the letter of law . 
  in contrast - tzar did n't pay attention to the legal frames of russification or `` syberian expeditions '', 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i do n't agree with many of his statements , but i must admit that he is a very inspirational person . 
  i need to read some of his works . 
  a big glass of nope . 
   in prussia and later in germany , poles were forbidden to build homes , and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs financed by the prussian and german governments . 
   bismarck described poles , as animals ( wolves ) , that `` one shoots if one can '' and implemented several harsh laws aimed at their expulsion from traditionally polish lands . 
  the polish language was banned from public , and ethnically polish children punished at schools for speaking polish . 
  [ 33 ] poles were subjected to a wave of forceful evictions ( rugi pruskie ) . 
  italian invasion ? 
  i do n't feel scared . 
  they seem to be a classic libdem party . 
  do n't overestimate the influence of kashubians in pomorskie . 
  it is always funny to me to see all those maps stating that we are mostly kashubians there . 
  i really enjoyed steppenwolf , but i could n't get through siddhartha, 
  just finished doctor faustus ( t. mann ), 
  came here to read comments on pol-rom relations , not on gypsies and their , erm , struggle to integrate ... 
   the main tv channels ( government owned ) we should only consider one channel here - tvp . 
  it is a public television , but still , you ca n't say that it is `` government owned '' or even `` controlled '' . 
   make it seem like there are only two parties in poland - po and pis . 
  not true . 
  obviously those parties are the most popular in news , as they are the ruling party ( po ) and the strongest party of opposition ( pis ) . 
   either for korwin yeah , i expected mentioning korwin , go spam onet.pl or kwejk, 
  well , the government did not fall , his party is still ruling . 
  in fact , the half of poles hates him , the other half - likes him . 
  please invest in eastern poland, 
  was xd, 
   yep ... just check out why did they receive almost 8 % in polls after one day of creating a party . 
  http://www.wprost.pl/ar/406331/sondaz-republikanie-wiplera-tuz-za-po-i-pis-em/ how about 20 % for wipler ? 
  xd but wipler is the knight of libertarianism and other pure national and conservative forces !, 
  no plot behind !, 
  / s  most of anti-eu have checked out how eu works , and read some books/watched documentaries . 
  you mean the korwin 's blog and `` yellow subtitles '' clips on yt ? 
  have you read giddens , habermas etc. 
  or just watched clips with farage ? 
  nowoczesna it seems to be the only choice for those who find themselves proeuropean and `` libdem '', 
  country : poland favourite neighbour : germany least favourite neighbour : russia, 
  poor italy , the quakes are so intense lately .

  something like `` the obedience of citizens is the happiness of the city '', 
  ok , however i guess it 's something more than a department , as it can act in the court ( as here v. post danmark in soe - or handelsretten ) http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=c-23/14, 
  is it the only installer in denmark ? 
  is it the same company as the producer of such systems ? 
  is it the only producer ? 
  did they justifiy the extra fee in any way ? 
  i thought the authority 's name 's konkurrencer\u00e5det . 
  what 's the difference ?

  made my day, 
  not very active though,
