what has german law to do with it ? 
  i wrote about american middle class , germans in the 50s were way too poor due to war to live like that . 
  a german law that treated women like property is hardly surprising , that 's what you do when left alone , make fucked laws and try to exterminate anyone different . 
  [ it 's not a new thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%bcrzburg_witch_trial ) , it 's who you are . 
  `` the w\u00fcrzburg witch trial , which took place in germany in 1626 -- 1631 , is one of the biggest mass-trials and mass-executions seen in europe during the thirty years war '' want to kill people just because they are slightly different ? 
  welcome to germany !, 
  what law was that ? 
  women are ** forced ** to work for money , because state policy is actively hostile to traditional one-income household . 
  in the 50s , women ** could ** work . 
  current reality is much worse in that regard and there 's no reason to cling to it . 
  what ? 
  change minor details ( like clothes ) and that 's an average middle class american family from the 50 's . 
  supporting a house with one income is only very hard because of social welfare , the biggest state expenditure . 
  if you add all taxes , direct and indirect , they consume the majority of income from labor , which means without them it would more than double . 
  which means that one-income household could have the same or even higher standard of living as a current two-income . 
  there 's nothing ` incompatible with reality ' about low taxes and no social welfare . 
  unless you plan on invading them , they just wo n't pay . 
  they wo n't pay anyway , the debt is way too big . 
  unless for some reason it 's euro that hyperinflates . 
  i 'm not moving the goalposts , i explained why people just wo n't pay taxes and there 's no way to make them . 
  so tax is irrelevant to drachma usage . 
  at best they may pay past taxes after they become minuscule due to hyperinflation . 
   people would need drachmas if they want to keep their houses , cars , property , etc. 
  ok , but how do you base most of your budget on a wealth tax during enormous crisis without revolution ? 
  because that means that you ask unemployed families with houses to suddenly pay big amounts they do n't have . 
  they ca n't even sell because nobody is buying . 
  obviously they do n't pay . 
  then what . 
  send the police/army to throw them on the street ? 
  so now you have an empty house and several people who hate you and have nothing to lose . 
  that would be very stupid thing for a government to do , so i do n't see that happening . 
  so no evictions . 
  cut their electricity ? 
  [ they are doing it already anyway ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/11/05/greeces-ppc-to-cut-power-to-2-1-million-customers-owing-e2-5-billion/ ) . 
  2.1 million is 19 % of greece 's population ... 
  it 's probably going to make people use oil generators for basic needs , or just steal electricity . 
  cars - now that one is easy , hide your car from the collections . 
  solve random police checks with bribes . 
  physical enforcements aside , it would cause wide swaths of population to get into tax debt . 
  which means if they work they are going to do so completely off the books , as otherwise a big part of their pay would be taken . 
  i do n't see taxing wealth as a workable solution . 
  people just are n't going to pay . 
  edit : i just realized it 's 2.1 million households/businesses . 
  so that 's probably about 30 % of total population ... 
  i wonder if the cuts were realized . 
  look that 's what actually happened in many former soviet countries . 
  the state simply collapsed , and what remained had only a weak power in bigger cities . 
  outside - zero . 
  i understand it 's almost impossible to imagine for someone living their whole life in the uk . 
   people will need drachmas to pay their tax . 
  people just do n't pay . 
  tax evasion is already very big in greece , what do you think is going to happen when enforcers get paid shit ? 
  they stop enforcing the law , instead the use the threat of enforcement to get bribes ( in foreign currency obviously ) . 
   in many other countries people informally use a different currency to save , and due to gresham they avoid using it for anything else . 
  in the stabilization phase , the local currency is no longer a unit of account , it becomes just a unit of exchange . 
  to this day you can see prices in ` contractual units ' in russia , where you pay in rubles price denominated in dollars at current rate . 
  i heard they are becoming much more popular in ukraine . 
  that 's the later phase , when some stabilization occurs and state gets more powerful . 
  the initial phase is total rejection . 
  except what would actually happen is the whole productive economy would start to use physical euros , with nobody accepting drachmas . 
  as a result , the state would completely collapse , as they would pay every public employer with drachmas that would be probably worth less than the paper and ink . 
  given how many greeks depend on the state that would probably mean revolution . 
  even if not , widespread survival problems . 
  all this during the biggest immigration crisis since ww2 . 
  in any case , it would * maybe * help their trade balance after several years of complete chaos . 
  if we define fine as converting every euro in a greek bank at a 1:1 rate into drachma , which is then going to hyperinflate, 
  just plain racism . 
  although their social standing is higher than muslims, 
  i think it 's the first map of this type where moldova is n't last . 
  poland is the [ safest european country ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ) . 
  as long as you 're not an arab/muslim/black i guess . 
  it would make more sense ` anyone who can be mistaken for an arab , or otherwise muslim and/or black ' . 
  nobody is going to attack you if you 're for example vietnamese or chinese . 
  these images are a bit hyperbolic , but smoking is indeed [ very restricted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smoking_in_singapore ) . 
  weirdly enough , ecigs are totally banned , which is n't reasonable even from an eventual total ban standpoint . 
  they should embrace them as a less harmful replacement and ban cigarettes instead . 
  singapore is a [ fine ] ( https://thehikinghighheel.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/singaporefinecityparti_7.jpg ) [ city ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/everystockphoto/fspid40/15/15/85/06/apore-chinatown-15158506-l.jpg ) . 
  also porn is illegal , gay sex is punishable by up to two years in prison and [ internet is censored ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_in_singapore ) . 
  the current world order only began 71 years ago , that 's not even one average human lifespan . 
  pax americana is not eternal , to think so is delusion . 
  it may crumble during your lifetime , it may not , but eventually , it will . 
  the entity that 's going to attack sweden may not even exist at this point , it could well be internal . 
  with your lack of morale , an army of several thousand islamists would be probably enough . 
  also , you are n't even in nato and are n't otherwise allied with the us . 
  in case of russian invasion , there would be no military action , russia would get sanctioned and shunned , but that 's probably it . 
  there 's no way america is going to risk nuclear war for a non-allied non-nato country , especially one as pacifist as yours . 
   what i mean is that what used to be normal for a long time might not be so normal in the future . 
  even with infinite resources ( including living space !, 
  ) , all you need for war are people who are absolutely convinced that your way of life and/or laws are wrong . 
  which includes someone like erdogan who gets mad that a citizen of another country insults him without legal consequences , starts a war . 
  see [ trojan war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trojan_war ) for another possible reason . 
  how many swedes would be willing to risk their life to defend sweden in an actual war , where you have to kill foreigners ? 
  i would guess not many , and the very small minority that would , would classify themselves as nationalist . 
  which in your country would be called racism/nazism and heavily shunned , would n't it ? 
  so there you have it . 
  you are one invasion away from extinction , in the best case of swedish culture , language and state , in the worst , physical . 
  lack of nationalism is lethal in the long run . 
  there 's always going to be a war in the future . 
  as long as humans exist , there will be war . 
  so basically he wants estonia to become an european singapore .
