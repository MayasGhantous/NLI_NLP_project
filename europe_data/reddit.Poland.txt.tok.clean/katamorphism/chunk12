  that 's not exactly productive capital . 
  the whole western world is in a decades-long property bubble which ca n't last due to demographics . 
  nominal gdp can change much faster . 
  it depends entirely on exports . 
  to italy ? 
  definitely , just look at their growth rates from 1990 . 
  germany - unlikely to happen in xxi century , although they are going to hit a demographic cliff very soon . 
  within small realm of possibility . 
  ireland - i do n't think so . 
  while spending cuts are good , increasing taxes is a really stupid move , they are already very high . 
  you ca n't squeeze blood from a stone . 
  the only real result is going to be increased emigration of those with highest added value . 
  greece is definitely at a point where increased taxes decrease budget revenue in the mid and long term . 
  romanians are n't slavs, 
  i 'm sure there 's much more to it , but signing documents , licensing a business and filling taxes online is hardly exceptional . 
  i think the author is from croatia ? 
  czech republic is nothing like poland . 
  they used to be much , much richer , but stagnated . 
  in 1990 their gdp ppp per capita was 112 % bigger ( [ google public data explorer 1990 ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:cze:pol&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) ) , now ( 2016 estimates from wiki ) just 18 % . 
  this also explains why ( mainly older ) czechs feel superior ( polish stereotype is pretty much a poor hustler ) : they still live in the past when the economic distance was bigger than between current poland and germany . 
  there 's no free market in healthcare . 
  free market means you could go to a pharmacy and buy any drug you want without prescription , or start offering medical services of any kind . 
  what 's in place is a guild system , straight up from medieval ages . 
  gaining entry requires paying enormous sums for guild-licensed education and passing the guild-approved exams and practices . 
  it 's highly illegal for people outside of the guild to practice . 
  not surprisingly it ends up being extremely expensive . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  the fact that most people think of healthcare in the us as ` free market ' only shows how powerful the said guild is - they won over the language itself , in the orwellian way . 
  import tax is only dangerous if you have something to pay with . 
  american gdp per capita is already 50 % higher than france 's . 
  taxing robots could turn eu into an open-air museum . 
   knows more about it if you ever try to build a house you will find that , in fact , cost is a sum of needed materials , which are overwhelmingly globally traded commodities , and labor needed to put them together . 
  if you ever try to buy something in a different currency , you will find that you need to buy it first . 
   who is doing it professionally what does that even mean , you 're a clerk at a bank that tells people whether their credit score is enough ? 
  definitely nothing with accounting , as you would know that owned commodities are assets . 
   read this paper which is about differences in impact of trade in tangible and intangible goods on the exchange rate - not relevant . 
  with your ` master ' degree and ` then you do ' it 's clear you 're functionally illiterate , so in simple terms : * everything tradable * is either a good or a service . 
  sometimes services are also treated like a type of goods . 
  fungible goods are called commodities . 
  intangible goods are things like intellectual property . 
  assets consist of all owned goods with positive value + special non-goods like goodwill . 
  owned houses are assets , whether they 're commodities or not depends on how fungible they are . 
   not driven by trade of goods and services [ . . ] is driven by asset prices and speculation a direct contradiction . 
  speculation * is * trading of goods and services . 
   my ** master ** thesis in finance lol  houses are not a commodity but an asset these terms are orthogonal . 
  you lack knowledge of basic concepts . 
  at least , try reading some wikipedia , perhaps next time you 'll manage to hide your ignorance for longer . 
   but the exchange rate is not driven by trade/gdp ( aka real value ) but by house prices that 's physically impossible , exchange rate depends on cross-currency trade . 
  exchange rate is literally trade - someone needs a currency , someone needs the other one ... 
  so the only way it could depend on house prices is with connection to cross-currency trade , but the existence of such trade directly contradicts the first part of what you wrote . 
   if the houses are really that much overvalued in poland they are n't , it 's because commodity prices are global , unless you are completely cut off from the global market . 
  concrete manufactured in poland can only be cheaper from a german one by the difference in transportation costs . 
  only land prices are completely local . 
  wages partially - the part of the living cost that depends on commodities is absolute . 
   by the `` nominal gdp '' logic the german just produced 12 times more value . 
  no , gdp is added value , you have to subtract costs . 
  the highest one is probably rent , then cost of being able to do labor ( living costs , transport , etc ) . 
  no way it 's going to be 12x , probably 2-3x . 
  there 's no such thing as an inherent value . 
  oil is much more valuable in an oil tank than underground , same with ice in saudi arabia compared to antarctica . 
  so yes , the barber is more productive in germany . 
  estonia has the best corporate income tax system in eu . 
  as long as you invest you do n't have to pay taxes . 
  also close to the nordics, 
  ppp is a completely artificial measure , worthless in practice . 
  you ca n't actually buy anything tangible for ` ppp dollars ' . 
  nominal levels reflect actual wealth and living standards much better . 
  a major part of difference in living costs is due to housing , but it 's only very expensive in places with high incomes . 
  it 's easy to find a house in eastern germany much cheaper than in poland , which makes total living cost rougly equivalent ( in absolute terms ) , which in practice means same ppp multiplier as for poland !, 
  for usa differences can be much bigger , land is very cheap outside of major cities . 
  a much more fundamental problem is with the ppp metric itself . 
  it depends on local inflation baskets , which are different for each country !, 
  they measure ` average household ' . 
  ** example : an inflation basket for very rich country would include prices of $ xxx - $ xxxx designer tshirts , which would be then compared to $ x tshirts in poland 's basket . 
  ** as polish ones are much cheaper = very high ppp multiplier . 
  it is the most meritocratic sector in the world . 
  you do n't need formal education to succeed . 
  are you serious ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_invasion_of_poland_ ( 1939 ), 
  at least that makes maidan useful in some way , 
  it is n't , results are low because of demographics . 
  for 2012 , [ asian-americans ] ( https://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/12/overall-pisa-rankings-include-america.html ) score above all european countries , whites score like switzerland . 
  similar story for the murder rate . 
  polish results are horrible , 2012 's were much better . 
  not sure why . 
  however , 2012 results were very close to the german ones and still are . 
  perhaps a change in methodology or just expected variance . 
  if it 's variance , differences of that magnitude mean pisa is n't worth much . 
  though i read somewhere that pisa has big problems in that they can - after the test - decide to ignore one or more question entirely in selected countries if they decide the translation was wrong or something . 
  that could change results drastically . 
   the road south is just over there putting you in a wagon to siberia is a simpler option . 
  current world order is n't going to last eternally . 
  when it falls , suddenly you will realize that lithuania has the economy and population of a city and zero chance of defending against anyone . 
   `` lived there for hundreds of years ... '' lived in lithuania . 
  no , they lived in poland . 
  current ` lithuanians ' are descendants of local peasants . 
  peasants do n't have nationality . 
  true lithuanians - nobles from the grand duchy of lithuania - that were worth anything became completely polonized , all you did was stole their culture and history . 
  there 's a reason why most ` lithuanian ' books you read in school are translations . 
  mickiewicz did n't even understand lithuanian .
