  singapore is like an inverse of sv , even though both are obviously rich . 
  many great american startups start by ignoring the law ( especially the financial regulations ) and the authorities let them be . 
  trying to create eg . 
  paypal , which was initially created by libertarians as a worldwide bank that allows people to become independent from governments , would result in a fast prison sentence in singapore and that would be it . 
  in the same vein , uber could n't begin in singapore , as it began as a way to ` disrupt ' taxi laws . 
  still , he is not a dictator , even though he personally likes a modern version of enlightened despotism does n't mean estonia is going to become like that . 
  making the government digital is good in itself . 
  https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/29/the-social-laboratory/ < - did you know that singapore is a total surveillance state ? 
  all those where the concept of their nationality was created in a late xix century . 
  so ukraine , latvia , estonia , belarus . 
  lithuania to a very large extent , as there 's no cultural continuity - old lithuanian nobles did n't even speak lithuanian , but ruthenian ( de facto official language ) and ( later ) polish . 
  probably more . 
   thilo sarrazin rotfl , mild criticism of lack of integration , and even that resulted in a major butthurt . 
   jesus , that 's laughably stupid . 
  :d you have no idea how courts and constitutions work , have you ? 
  you should learn basic history some time , and logic while you are at it . 
   which is in poland now also under control of pis . 
  it may be inconceivable to someone like you living in a totalitarian country , but it 's possible and in fact normal to have several media companies completely independent from the state . 
   unlike it ** might ** be the case in poland 's future . 
  do i really have to spell out what germany might do in the future ? 
  ( again ) uncertain future has no bearing on the current status . 
  can you go publicly ( tv , newspaper article , etc ) , call islam evil and totalitarian , and demand its total ban , all without any fear of criminal proceedings ? 
  if the answer is no , as of now , germany has objectively less freedom of speech . 
   it 's the court to defend freedom against any threat . 
  including a government if the court can overrule ` government ' it means the court is the real government !, 
  then you have the same problem again - quis custodiet ipsos custodes ? 
  the whole concept of constitutional court is a farce . 
  it 's illuminating how you ignored everything relevant . 
  i guess widespread censorship in germany is so unquestionable , the only possible answers are silence or agreement . 
   would n't be his first time in prison ... ( drug dealing , robbery , violent crimes ) so you 're implicitly saying it 's ok to trample his rights , because he was in prison in the past !, 
  shining german justice . 
   oh yeah , totaaally irrelevant , sure . 
  how is the state of constitutional tribunal relevant to freedom of the speech ? 
   the freedom of the press is threatened it is n't . 
  we have people saying on the tv that we should accept all refugees , and we have those that call for a total ban on islam and quran , calling it a criminal evil totalitarian system . 
  that 's what freedom of the press ( well , media ) means . 
  ideally all viewpoints would be ok , unfortunately we also have anti hate speech laws , but the enforcement is lax . 
  at the same time , [ germany mass censors internet posts ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-springs-to-action-over-hate-speech-against-migrants/2016/01/06/6031218e-b315-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html ) . 
  what would happen to the second person in germany ? 
  i guess you know better . 
  just do n't sugarcoat , [ pegida leader could go to prison ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/founder-of-german-islamophobic-group-pegida-to-stand-trial-for-hate-speech ) just for calling immigrants ` scum ' . 
  to be fair , you 're still miles ahead of the uk , which seems to use ' 1984 ' as a direct manual . 
   even worse the constitutional court is taken prisoner by your government that 's not relevant . 
  what is happening in poland ? 
  this has nothing to do with freedom of the press . 
  freedom of the press concerns state 's policy and law . 
  expected sun , no sun . 
  feel sadness . 
  a passive ~ 120m ^ 2 ceramic block house costs about $ 90k . 
  passive house is defined as needing < = 15kwh of heating/m ^ ( 2 ) / year . 
  that 's at most $ 100 for heating annually . 
  or nothing with solar panels . 
  norway near the coast has very similar temperatures so there 's no difference there . 
  $ 300k for a wooden house is absolutely ridiculous and pure waste of money . 
  there 's no secret technology to use there . 
  if that 's really what you have to pay i guess the answer is you do n't know how to build houses . 
  for the price difference you could build a 0.3 mwp pv , which would produce enough income to live comfortably even in a poorly insulated wooden house . 
   with heat recycling and climate control systems every house built in the past 20 years has these . 
  `` heat recycling '' is just air mixing + heating outside air by radiator heated by air pumped out . 
  perhaps you meant earth heat pump . 
  the disconnect between feelings of safety and actual safety in poland is enormous . 
  i found it to be common opinion that today is much more dangerous compared to the 90s . 
  or perhaps gut feeling is the better term . 
  the time where we had actual crime , small and big , like gang assassinations and mafia-police shootings . 
  unattended belongings quickly disappeared . 
  yet people who as kids were going to school alone ( walking + public transport ) now drive their kids to and from school for ` safety ' . 
  people with expensive bikes are paranoid about general security , but leave them for long and ` protect ' them with a $ 2 lock you could probably cut with scissors , yet nothing happens . 
  in fact i do n't know anybody who had their bike stolen in the last 10 years . 
  reason ? 
  economic development . 
  in the past ( mostly ) american tv series and movies were clearly about alien world . 
  now differences are mostly superficial . 
  so the western tv reality seems way more real which translates into people 's gut feelings , which results in paranoia . 
  this also makes people associate old times with safety , just because they were different . 
  i hope the youngest generation is going to be more realistic about safety . 
  yeah , which is why i asked . 
  is there an european country without them ? 
  in the past they just lived nomadically on the whole continent . 
  they are so concentrated in your areas because of slavery in wallachia and moldavia . 
  what . 
  they were literally enslaved for 500 + years in romania , till 1856 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania you call that tolerance ? 
  gypsies were never discriminated in poland , but there were n't many of them anyway . 
  about 30k before wwii , half after . 
  hard to say how many of them died because borders changed substantially . 
  now there 's about 30k again . 
  not really , we do n't have gypsy ghettos at all . 
  at worst , we have places where several gypsy families are a problem . 
  [ families like these ] ( http://polska.newsweek.pl/polacy-i-romowie-w-limanowej-cyganie-newsweek-pl,artykuly,347162,1,1,3.html ) , but they are mostly an exception , and interestingly enough not really liked by other gypsies . 
  not surprising , who would want to be grouped with them . 
  that does n't mean gypsies are great , obviously they beg and steal . 
  their begging is usually organized . 
  like a van parks , 6 children + mother + father emerge , father starts to give them bags and instructions , they go to the neighboring houses to beg , every child to different area ... to be fair , many of them work simple physical jobs . 
  still , nothing comparable to lunik ix . 
  there 's a geoblock and a weird puzzle to solve , pls help https://imgur.com/dguehst edit : the answer is 7  sfetovan\u00fd is that the word because of am ** feta ** mina ? 
   up to 7-8 % of slovakia are romas what about the future ? 
  because it seems the average gypsy family has 6-8 kids , and they marry at ~ 13 . 
  are gypsies going to be half of slovakia 's population in 2050 ? 
  holy fuck compared to them , polish gypsies are upstanding citizens, 
  it 's legal , pimping is illegal though . 
  there are several online sites with prostitutes ' advertisements , containing description , photos , movies , etc.
