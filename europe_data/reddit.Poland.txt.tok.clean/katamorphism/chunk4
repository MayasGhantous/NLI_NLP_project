  why ? 
  because your german solar industry is worthless . 
  it 's an inefficient centrally planned monster that can only exist by sucking the money from everyone else , thanks to the government obviously . 
  ** due to their lobbying power solar power is much more expensive eu-wide than it could be . 
  thanks for fucking up the environment , germany . 
  ** i mean actual pollution , not co2 . 
  archive is/psvlq fucking self-contradictory automod ` chinese subsidies ' mean [ $ 42 billion in cheap ** loans ** from the government ] ( https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:koxj-s7wkowj:www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/why-millions-of-chinese-made-solar-panels-sat-unused-in-southern-california-warehouses-for-years+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=pl ) . 
  that 's two times what germany ** spends ** in [ two years ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/solar-subsidy-sinkhole-re-evaluating-germany-s-blind-faith-in-the-sun-a-809439.html ) for subsidies . 
  data is old , but both periods are the same ( 2010-2012 for china and 2011 for germany ) , which makes them comparable . 
  wow you have a really positive outlook on life . 
  it 's sad that in poland ` romanian ' became almost synoymous with gypsy because of politically-correct media who reported them as ` romanian citizens ' in every crime related case . 
  the meaning is slowly changing though , especially in the younger people . 
  only one counterexample is needed to disprove a theory . 
   the worst confirmed symptom of hypervitaminosis c is kidney stones that 's hardly ` toxicity ' . 
  the supposed mechanism is that vitamin c decreases ph and that makes stones more likely . 
  that may be true , but that would mean that one bottle of coke would be much more dangerous than weeks of several grams of vit c per day . 
  also vitamin c supplements may be taken preferably by meat eaters , which would increase acidity on its own . 
  in any case , that 's not really something to care about . 
  that 's absolutely ridiculous . 
  linus pauling was taking [ 18g/day ] ( https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/mmbbkt.pdf ) for the majority of his life and he lived for 93 years . 
  so no , 2g/day is not toxic . 
  american rda is laughably wrong , the worst one is vitamin d . a typical office worker , who sees close to zero sun , should take 10k iu/day . 
  a day in the sun can produce as much as 25k iu !, 
  yet the rda is a ridiculous 600iu . 
  not surprisingly , the [ cardiac problems due to insufficient vitamin d ] ( http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=2507290#tab1 ) are widespread . 
  you do n't need fruits for vitamin c , vegetables are sufficient . 
  in fact bell pepper has the second highest content per g after guava , more than three times that of oranges and lemons . 
  the biggest practical source is sauerkraut , about half orange 's content per g , but it 's usually eaten in bigger portions and much more often . 
  that , or you can buy 1kg of vitamin c powder for $ 5 and take 1g every day . 
  i eagerly await a similar article in the 2036 's edition about a ` global warming conspiracy ' . 
  regressive left strikes again . 
  in a sensible world this is something you would expect from a theocracy . 
  the way things are going , in a decade some ` progressive ' government is going to reintroduce death penalty for some anti-state crime , and the ` far right ' is going to protest . 
  pro-choice slogan fits perfectly here : [ ` my body my choice ' ] ( https://peonymoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/my-body-my-experience-my-sexuality-my-choice.jpg ) . 
  [ doubleplusgood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspeak ), 
  lol no that would be a massive liability . 
  only old buildings and tombstones are polish and they are of purely sentimental value . 
  everything else is close to worthless . 
  even ignoring hostile part of population whose favorite past time is masturbating to bandera 's portraits , the total social-economic disparity is closer to the south/north korea 's than to the gdr/frg 's one . 
  the germans spent two trillion euros on reunification to date and the results are n't that great . 
  yeah , it 's clear the current borders does n't work . 
  what 's needed is a country-wide referendum which would result either in two countries , or a smaller ukraine with the eastern part joining russia . 
  ukraine has no future in its present state - the most likely outcome in 10 years is being europe 's poorest country ( by nominal gdp per capita ) with no chance of growth due to old population . 
  young men in particular are running away en masse to escape draft in addition to poverty . 
  it seems to be a case of ` drunk girl agrees to fuck with drunk men ' , changes her mind when sober , men go to prison . 
   everybody who had already been born due to that procedure would have it mentioned on their id card that sounds like insane anti-pis propaganda . 
  the probable source of it is the fact that method of conception is indeed being registered now in the birth act . 
  however , the law was created by the ** previous government ** to deny lesbians chance for in vitro children ( effectively donald tusk 's government , very progressive for ec 's president ) . 
  this law sort of surprised everybody . 
  that 's because it 's concentrated , you vape much smaller amounts, 
  exact same situation in poland . 
  close to 100 % of social spending is for old and ` old ' ( like 40 year old pensioners ) . 
  the total taxes take about half from a salary , of which about 60 % goes to pensions . 
  the result is that pensioners have the second highest average income in the country ( after a much smaller group of company owners ) . 
  they also own apartments which they got for free from the government , while young people have to go into debt for 30 years . 
  not surprisingly the fertility rate is low . 
  if you wanted to depopulate a country it would be hard to create a more effective policy . 
  there 's no church tax so it does n't really matter . 
  what ? 
  ii rp too , poles were only 69 % of population . 
   it 's irrelevant now . 
  it 's relevant - it 's important to learn from history and not repeat past mistakes . 
  do you realize poland was the most multicultural state in europe ? 
  it lost independence because of that . 
  first , cossacks on the east waged a huge uprising . 
  shortly after that , protestant minorities cooperated with swedes which [ completely devastated the country and left 25 % of population dead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29#destruction_of_the_commonwealth ) . 
  the state never recovered and eventually lost its independence to austria , prussia and russia . 
  again the minorities ( mostly foreign eastern nobles ) helped , but it was nearly certain anyway . 
  then there 's world war 2 , which occurred only after 21 years of newly won independence , during which ukrainian minorities exterminated about 300k poles , their neighbors . 
  so if anything , your argument proves the opposite of what you wanted !, 
  repeating the mistakes of the past ( ie . 
  multiculturalism ) would be idiotic . 
  that 's only murder according to western values . 
  that 's presumably a reasonable self-defense in their tribal culture . 
  failure is when you fail to obtain your goal . 
  instilling western values was never their goal . 
  in fact as you can see the murder was a good decision . 
  there were no bad consequences , and presumably his and his family 's social standing among his arabian peers substantially increased . 
  i bet he is now a prime candidate for a husband in their circle and his father received many marriage proposals from other families . 
  so effectively , they prepared him well even for life in sweden . 
  the only entity that failed here is the swedish state . 
  it 's not really failed parenting . 
  it 's adequate parenting for a tribal warrior culture . 
  the parents successfully raised him according to their values . 
  a nationalist socialist who thinks of certain foreign people as inherently inferior ... sounds vaguely familiar to something . 
  you ca n't get addicted to meth . 
  `` psychological addiction '' means you just like it . 
  do you have a hobby you like to do often ? 
  you 're also ` psychologically addicted ' . 
  also , pure meth has basically the same risk profile as amphetamine . 
  does that party support drug liberalization ? 
  in that case , i see nothing wrong here . 
  they are n't , that 's just what the far-left calls them , ie . 
  those that call all nationalists neo nazis . 
  if anything they are similar to francoists , but are n't them either . 
  they are no neo nazi organizations in poland now . 
  a loose offshoot of blood & honour existed about 10 years ago but does n't seem to exist anymore . 
  very unlikely . 
  all putin wants is a xx century style meetup with lines drawn on a map . 
  that line is going to be at the eastern eu border .
