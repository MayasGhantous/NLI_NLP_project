  he gets to do whatever he wants in ukraine and georgia , including a full invasion , some agreement on syria . 
  that depends on ( 1 ) what 's your opinion about drugs and ( 2 ) how informed you are . 
  they are by far the most criminal ethnicity at least in the [ uk ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sl4hn5v.jpg ) . 
  they seem to specialize in drugs though , as opposed to real ( malum in se ) crime . 
  do n't know where to find similar statistics from poland , but in a ` general opinion ' they grow the majority of marijuana . 
  looking at the uk stats it definitely has some basis in reality . 
  it 's sildenafil , the fake part refers to branding and lack of permits, 
   when looking at gdp per capita , always look at constant prices , not current prices . 
  absolutely not . 
  this only works for gdp in national currency . 
  that 's because each country has a different inflation basket * and * the whole idea of a basket is arbitrary . 
  dollars are deflated using each country 's inflation rate . 
  by using constant $ gdp you are comparing apples to oranges . 
  the graph you posted proves that . 
  constant dollar * ca n't * change real ranking . 
  that 's absurd . 
  the fact that it does proves it 's a wrong metric . 
  to get true constant dollar you would have to compute something called ` constant ppp $ ' because it would first convert gdp to us-equivalent ppp units which could then be deflated with american inflation rate . 
   but i kind of assumed that was a small companies thing is this normal ? 
  size does n't matter , in fact it 's very common in semi-large factories . 
  it depends on a job type , well paid jobs instead migrate to an independent contractor model , as this limits company 's cost to pay + neutral vat , employee pays 19 % tax + ~ 300 $ monthly in social taxes . 
  those that work remotely for non-eu companies may find it easy hide their income . 
  the only sector where official wages are true is the public sector . 
  that 's because labor taxes are enormous , basically half ( partially hidden by 'em ployers portion ' which is paid in addition to gross ) . 
  first , there 's lots of double counting , because being long and short the same instrument , indirectly in one case , is going to net to a much smaller value , perhaps zero . 
  second , actual payment on a net exposure is the difference between starting price and closing price , not total net value . 
  which is also why fed bailed out banks in 2008 , as derivatives net to manageable numbers only as long as the other side does n't default . 
  that money allowed the system to clean itself out . 
  at the end , the losses were n't that big and banks returned the initial bailout money . 
  it 's surprising to me that you think poland is different . 
  apparently we have good brand image in russia . 
   i wonder how the average russian is going to handle being quite a bit worse off than the average pole in the coming years . 
  coming years ? 
  [ net monthly average wages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) : russia - 409 $ poland - 752 $ russian average income was always lower since the fall of ussr . 
  from data that 's easier to find , they had slightly higher nominal gdp per capita only in 2012 ( 7 % ) and 2013 ( 5 % ) , so they 're the only reasonable candidates ( in the 90s it was more than 2x smaller ) , but using that wikipedia page incomes were still lower . 
   `` unity makes power '' wow , it 's like you 're an antagonist from a story about totalitarian dystopia . 
  absolutely horrible policy . 
  all it does is breed resentment and culture of snitching , increases social divide and risk of crimes . 
  i have normal relations with people that make less in two years than i make in one month . 
  that 's because they do n't know . 
  when buying food on one tab we split it equally . 
  relations would get destroyed if they knew the difference . 
  criminals would know it too , i would probably have to move to a gated house with constant security instead of a standard apartment . 
   so little heart and a society so devoid of principles on the contrary : family before friends , friends before nation , nation before everything else . 
  or the much older saying : god , honor , fatherland , where the honor part covers personal obligations to family and friends . 
  soft heart is for them and the fatherland . 
  206 muslim refugees are 206 too many . 
  they bring nothing that is of value to us , and many things that are negative . 
  well , at this point it should be clear to everyone that the pendulum started to irreversibly swing back right , and probably will for the next two-three generations . 
  i do n't think so , a big fraction of emigrants try to be more british/german/etc than the natives , like they purposefully do n't speak polish with and near their kids . 
  that would mean there 's a small multiplier applied to the real data , but does n't explain the general increase and regional differences . 
  also it seems improbable because the whole point of testing groups at risk is to save time and money on pointless testing , are the hospitals really allowed to waste money so carelessly ? 
   when they gave it only to black parent ok so [ other groups ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498028 ) are supposed to be tested too , but from those the mediterranean countries have a very low fertility rate so they ca n't be responsible for the increase, 
  how is that even computed , are n't ethnic/religious statistics banned in france ? 
  i bet they used tfr data for origin countries . 
  the error also lies in the assumption that all immigrants are muslim . 
  lots of black african christians . 
  as of 2016 , ~ 40 % of newborns in urban france ( 80 % of total population ) have background from [ north/subsaharan africa ] ( https://i.imgur.com/73akbau.png ) . 
  the rate of change is way too high for such a small difference and population demographics . 
  that 's why joining the eu was horrible in retrospect . 
  it would have been great without free labor movement , but then the old-eu countries would have no reason to let poor countries join . 
  politically it ensured only old people 's votes matter , and what they want is second people 's republic ( only without russia ) , where everyone is equally poor , everything not explicitly allowed is prohibited and we are the world 's 10th coal producer , ie . 
  what ` strong industry ' means in their minds . 
  i 'm curious what 's so different in romania , they are poorer at the moment but that 's going to change soon with their free market policies ( eg . 
  no income tax for it and r & d workers , 16 % linear for the rest ) . 
  in poland current government plans about ~ 50 % for the ` rich ' ( ie . 
  close to average wage in germany ) . 
  [ what these numbers mean ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498028 ), 
  sweden has only [ 1.85 ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/population/population-composition/population-statistics/aktuell-pong/25795/yearly-statistics--the-whole-country/26040/ ) , and that 's with their big number of migrants in younger age groups . 
  foreign background 14.5 % to 22.2 % in 15 years , and migrants are hardly old ... data shows the same thing everywhere : no currently existing goverment program compelled people to have more kids . 
  it 's 2.4 according to the most recent [ source ] ( https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/dam/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.11/2016/wp13_r.pdf ) i could find . 
   israel 's welfare system is n't really that great either . 
  um , they basically have [ basic income ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052748703848204575608473772263624 ) for haredim , as long as they ` work ' studying the torah ... given their 6.9 tfr it seems there 's a lot of free time . 
   oh , and inb4 `` but le orthodox jews '' . 
  that 's not an excuse because having such groups changes norms in society . 
  here ` multi kid family ' meaning 3 + , sometimes 2 + is almost a synonym for ` dysfunctional , irresponsible , poor ' . 
  seeing a not that rare 10 + family ( so like ~ one std dev from haredim avg ) would shift the numbers upward . 
  i guess there 's also a factor of some basic instinct ` my neighbours are outbreeding me omg my genes ' . 
  mathematics is not a directly productive job , different category . 
  as for computers , actually you increasingly need them , many things are impossible to calculate manually but trivial on a computer . 
  then there are proof assistants which massively speed up everything . 
  doing anything math related without a computer is like fighting in a modern war with a spear as for electricity ... candles suck, 
  it is the most meritocratic sector because the only national infrastructure needed is electrical , and everyone in these countries can afford a computer since ~ 2000 . 
  what i do n't get is what 's the point . 
  almost everyone from an eu country who wanted to move to the uk already did . 
  new generations are going to be very small due to very low fertility rates . 
  if any new accessions happen it 's going to be a maximum of about 10 million people in 2025 at the earliest ( serbia + montenegro + albania ) , so a ~ million migrants at most , which uk could block for 7 years and most would go elsewhere , as in 2025 there 's going to be big eu-wide labor shortage due to demographics . 
  2004 's enlargement was 7 times larger . 
  even deportations after withdrawal from eu would be pointless as now those that intend to remain can easily get citizenship , all you need is basic english +6 years of residence + no crime record . 
  given how slow everything is happening this is going to apply even to romanians and bulgarians . 
  that image with electrocution is really silly , air breakdown distance of 750v ac is < 0.2 mm ... you would have to actually touch that rail to get electrocuted . 
  1938 from poland 's , 1990 [ google public data explorer ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) , for 2016 converted [ $ 1854 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine ) to 1990 with [ this ] ( http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl ), 
  ** ukraine ** 's numbers are very interesting ( in 1990 's $ also ) : | year | 1938 | 1990 | 2016 | | ---------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | | gdp per capita | $ 1100 | $ 1569.74 | $ 1006.94 |, 
  the difference is in conscious decision . 
  were these just temporary lapses in self-control ? 
  a true christian would regret that afterwards and try to change so that it does n't happen again . 
  do n't care at all whether it 's a sin or not , or create your own interpretation where it 's not ? 
  yeah you are n't catholic/orthodox/whatever . 
  porn is n't a very good example because there 's nothing about porn in the bible . 
  so i guess you could argue it 's ok ( as long as you do n't masturbate ) and call yourself christian , although not ( for example ) catholic .
