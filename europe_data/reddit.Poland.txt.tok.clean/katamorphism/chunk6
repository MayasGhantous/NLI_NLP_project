  homosexuality however is clear , even ignoring old testament , there 's st. paul . 
  well being an active homosexual and a christian is just fundamentally incompatible , that 's a mortal sin . 
  i ca n't understand why they do that , because they obviously do n't actually believe . 
  are there some special tax breaks for being an anglican bishop or what . 
  that 's only fair if they do n't have to pay their health insurance . 
  sse in only for simple labor-intensive businesses . 
  employing a big number of local workers is one of the conditions . 
  also it 's not tax annulment , it 's really a [ small tax credit ] ( http://ksse.com.pl/ulga-w-podatku-cit,7 ) , like 25 % of initial investment + 25 % of two years of employees wages . 
  now compare that with estonia where all these taxes , as long as you reinvest/keep profits , are exactly zero . 
  so sse only makes sense if you need lots of cheap simple labor ...  tax breaks for companies working on intellectual property if you 're referring to [ this ] ( http://focusfinance.pl/nowe-preferencje-dla-podatnikow-ponoszacych-wydatki-na-dzialalnosc-badawczo-rozwojowa/ ) , that 's not a tax break . 
  that 's * allowing * to subtract r & d cost from profits , under severe limits , the worst of which is it maxes out at 10 % of total annual spending and 30 % of total salaries , whichever is lower . 
  fully automated factory where 90 % of staff is for r & d ? 
  haha , fuck you . 
  previously reducing tax by r & d was n't possible at all as that was n't * cost * of making something ... for r & d even france is much , much [ better ] ( http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2014/global/tax-july-2014/france-r-and-d-tax-incentives ) . 
  they have 100 % deduction with no stupid limits and a 20 % tax credit !, 
  a tax credit is subtracted from tax , not from profit . 
  basically , unless you have direct government money for specific research , it takes a special kind of idiot to do any kind of r & d in poland . 
  that 's even ignoring the reality of all these deductions , where the cash-starved state can just say that your r & d was n't really r & d just because , or even treat it as some kind of tax evasion ( especially if part of the r & d expenditures goes to foreign companies ) . 
  poland has one of the least r & d friendly tax structures in the world . 
   seems like lowering taxes even more wo n't solve a thing , does n't it ? 
  taxes are only relatively low for low-tech labor intensive businesses , so it 's not surprising they are the only ones that exist , outside of it . 
  it is unique in that it 's easy to treat r & d as ` normal business ' as that 's very hard to distinguish for the tax office . 
  which actually means a copy of existing business which has no chance of success . 
  if bureaucrats were good at investing they would n't work for the state . 
  also , private investors are very open to ` pivoting ' ie . 
  drastically altering the original idea , but if you do that with eu funds you will have to give them back , because of funding goal violation . 
  twitter was a pivot by a podcasting startup , android was initially designed as an operating system for cameras , flickr was a pivot from a mmo . 
  [ that 's what happens when bureaucrats decide who deserves money ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-15/meet-the-italian-man-who-beat-google-to-web-search-and-gave-it-away-for-free-.html ) . 
  nobody owes anything to ` society ' , as if such thing existed . 
  what actually exists is a state that takes money from a productive minority to ensure the majority likes the current system and helps in subjugating the productive minority . 
  literally slavery , only instead of one owner there are thousands/millions ( depending on the population size ) ` shareholders ' . 
  ketchup is made from tomatoes which makes it another type of tomato sauce . 
  it tastes better than the typical one, 
  pizza without ketchup or some other sauce is way too dry and clogging due to that , not sure what 's the issue . 
  a swap means that parties agree to exchange currencies now then reverse the exchange later , paying interest rates on what they got during that . 
  so poland gets euro and some counterparty gets yuans . 
  poland pays interest in euro , but ecb deposit rate is -0.4 % and lending 0 % , so poland either gets paid or perhaps pays nothing . 
  the counterparty pays poland interest on cny , with central bank 's rate at 4.35 % , so something around that . 
  from that payment poland pays 3.4 % to the original lenders . 
  apparently at the end all rates and fees add up to -0.173 % . 
  at the core it 's due to ecb 's negative rates , but also due to market distorting capital controls . 
  not sure why the chinese allowed this issuance , it 's not really compatible with the controls . 
  perhaps it 's part of a larger plan to supplant western financial system and making yuan free floating . 
  or maybe some powerful chinese businessmen saw this as a way to make money off the pboc 's arcane lending policies . 
  or there 's some deal that 's not yet public . 
  they got [ 2 million people ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2016/07/pd16_246_12421.html ) in 2015 ( net change 1.1 million ) , so housing shortages are n't surprising . 
  that 's ten years of replacement migration , also the houses vacated by the million that left probably were n't available immediately . 
   if they can not move to these areas , they will have be dependant on welfare and not integrate . 
  is there still anyone who sincerely expects current migrants to integrate ? 
  the optimists just hope the second generation and perhaps very young children will . 
   so germany needs to build a city like freiburg or l\u00fcbeck each year to handle the population growth . 
  they do n't , that 's roughly the advantage [ of deaths over births ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#statistics_since_1900 ) . 
  a rate of ~ 200k should keep the population stable for the next decade ... then they are going to need even more . 
  there 's no reason to have separate car and airport manufacturers in every country , it 's a very specialized job . 
  it 's already the case if you do any creative artwork . 
  every cd , cd writer , printer ( !, 
  ) , scanner and similar has a 1-3 % tax in it that goes to organizations like these . 
  you wo n't get any money from them unless you prove the specific instance in which your artwork was used publicly ( like music played in radio ) or you are a member of one of these organizations . 
  to be a member you must be invited by an existing member and your share in money is going to be completely arbitrary . 
  just another tax . 
  the way things are going , everyone in eu is going to need a vpn to use the internet normally . 
  just like in china . 
  it seems what you actually lament is the fact that mainstream media ca n't spin the reality any way they want any more . 
  you 're right about trump of course , but clinton ? 
  she 's the establishment candidate . 
  nobody would even * know * about email leak ( or something equivalent in a world without internet ) , benghazi , clinton foundation , fbi investigation , possible health problems etc. 
  main media simply would n't report anything . 
  also it 's not like without internet independent media [ ca n't exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samizdat ) , although the spread of information would certainly be hampered . 
  that would n't be really an enlargement , as you get insurance if you register as looking for employment . 
  people with serious problems would just register , or even get a fake part-time employment . 
  so it only deterred people with trivial problems at the expense of a big bureaucracy . 
  it 's a pointless system , which is what happens when you get a compromise between incompatible ideas - a worse result than any of the original proposals . 
  very common in politics everywhere . 
  i think it 's very likely it will go through . 
  i do n't think there 's an eu law that makes universal healtcare compulsory . 
  although it 's probably going to become a moot issue , as the new government plans to make the system universal , which should actually save money on bureucracy . 
  funnily enough , after euroswaps the interest rate ( in euro ) is [ -0,173 % ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/polska-wyemitowala-obligacje-denominowane-w-juanie-7474730.html ) , which is much better than what germany [ got in july ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25ae95da-48db-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab.html ) ( -0.05 % ) . 
  china has capital controls . 
  you need government permission to sent money ( including yuan ) abroad . 
  these bonds are the first to be issued in unrestricted internal market . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-onshore-and-offshore-renminbi-2013-2?ir=t https://news.markets/explainer-articles/cny-cnh-rmb-heres-how-they-differ-12107/ the practical result is that there 's much more demand . 
  after euro swaps , the resulting interest rate in euro is -0.173 % . 
  which funnily enough is better than recent german 10yr eurobond july issuance at -0.05 %, 
  lol @ looking for antisemitism where there is none . 
  persecution complex forever . 
  it 's not ` antisemitism ' ( hate ) but indifference . 
  they do n't care about actual jews at all , including their feelings about being used as a name for a football club . 
  this is about unavailable advanced therapy , but universal healthcare is only for children and students . 
  adults are n't insured by default , although only a minority is n't . 
  definition of religion is completely arbitrary . 
  in practice it 's just a popularity contest . 
  so what you are actually deriding is disagreeing with the common opinion . 
  treating `` religion '' as a special category is historical baggage . 
  child rapists ? 
  did you miss the part about 14 years old . 
  that 's a normal historical marriageable age , which is currently also the minimum marriage age for females in myanmar . 
  before xix century in europe the most common limit ( for females ) was 12 . 
  it 's not like they would be in school otherwise . 
  no , most likely they would be starving , working much worse jobs on a farm , or prostituting themselves . 
  having a job like that allows them to have some stability and save something for the future .
