  also 14 years should be ok for a job even in europe , i was working part time distributing leaflets when 12 and it was ok , having your own earned cash is very nice, 
   it 's a country which is upper-middle-income and has a real shot at becoming a high income ( by world bank definition ) within the next decade . 
  compare their [ fertility rate map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:turkey_total_fertility_rate_by_province_2013.png ) with [ ethnicity map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:t%c3%bcrkiyeetnikharitas%c4%b1.jpg ) . 
  losing a bunch of territory seems more likely than becoming high-income . 
  just as hard as in the current most developed and peaceful states . 
  in fact much easier , as a house would be much more accessible to the general population ( either cheaper or easier to build yourself ) . 
  if you have a nice comfortable cheap place to live it 's unlikely you 're going to go on a rampage, 
  it 's pretty amazing the spanish government did n't demolish it and fine him for unauthorized construction , it 's like some kind of libertarian fiction . 
  why poland and not romania ? 
  not like it 's bad to be in it here , but it 's better in romania due to tax exemption or even 16 % linear if not applicable . 
  also their language should be way easier for you . 
  i definitely would n't move into poland , future is going to suck . 
  that 's a private newspaper , so there 's no relation . 
  krak\u00f3w and its neighborhood is special , because the old nickname for one of the football clubs - cracovia - is ` jews ' , because it had a big proportion of them before the war . 
  so opposing football fans use swastikas and antisemitism to fight them , not actual jews . 
  i guess it also inflamed actual antisemitism through conflation , but football tribalism really is the prime cause here . 
  i know it sounds ridiculous . 
  now an antisemitic graffiti in warsaw or somewhere far from krak\u00f3w is unquestionably about actual jews . 
  previously they used assault rate along with homicide rate . 
  now they mainly use the proportion of citizens that feel safe . 
  seems to be objectively worse to me - literally - previous ranking was objective , now it 's subjective . 
  poles are ridiculously paranoid about dangers , not just crime , so that result makes sense . 
  note that ** the ranking now places japan on par with france ** and as more unsafe than sweden . 
  a country where little kids travel between cities alone to school and nobody bats an eye . 
  apparently japanese are also on the paranoid side . 
  based on japan 's result alone , new oecd safety ranking is worthless . 
  wonder if the change was politically motivated or a result of well meaning stupidity . 
   but this situation is about non-performing loans at its heart . 
  which was solved by printing lira ( then in large part literally ) . 
  high inflation is effectively a continuous bail-in , so this stopped excessive socialization of losses . 
  good investments produced positive real return , bad only nominal . 
  it also was an effective tax on the shadow cash-only economy . 
  it made over regulated labor market more efficient : unproductive workers could trivially get raises below inflation . 
  even government wage-indexed payouts were much more flexible because it 's relatively easy for the state to understate inflation . 
  many more perks i guess . 
  that was the italian way and it apparently worked . 
   how does a rule that creates the outcome it is supposed to prevent make sense ? 
  what is logical about forcing a state to implement capital controls , panicking the populace , and victimising innocent people ? 
  it 's the opposite - innocent people are getting victimized now . 
  they have youth unemployment rate of [ 44.2 % ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-31/italian-unemployment-rises-with-youth-jobless-at-record-high ) . 
  that 's a good symptom that a system is fixed by those currently in power . 
  from the unionized workers that do n't care that their demands make it almost impossible to employ new workers , to big companies that cooperate with the government in making it impossible for competition to grow , and last but not least politicians that buy votes with irresponsible spending promises . 
  so the current italian system is evil and destined to completely devour productive sectors before total collapse . 
  if you take low-inflation euro as an axiom ( as germans do ) the only path to salvation is to force a smaller localized collapse that hopefully results in reform . 
   tbh , i really get tired of this ` blame the person in distress ' argument . 
  it 's not blame , just incompatibility . 
   in that sense , i think the ecb should step in directly and fix the italian banking system , taking upon its balance sheet npl to be disposed of as it wishes , and recapitalising banks to restore stability . 
  that 's not state aid -- neither the government or the taxpayers ever see a dime , nor are further indebted as a result . 
  that would share the cost over the entire eurozone so there 's no way it becomes standard practice . 
  it 's probably going to happen soon , but too much of that and even germany is going to start thinking about leaving the euro . 
  current ecb debt monetization already caused high inflation in advanced technology goods , just look at eurusd . 
  it 's entirely possible that the german system would be working perfectly right now with [ high deflation with no nominal rises ] ( https://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screen-shot-2013-05-14-at-12-33-06-pm.png ) - a complete opposite to italy . 
  it 's hard to imagine the true scale of misallocation that occurred due to the euro . 
  the total opportunity cost would probably dwarf loses from both world wars . 
  it would be unfair to blame germans for that one : all this is ultimately [ france 's ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-price-of-unity-was-the-deutsche-mark-sacrificed-for-reunification-a-719940.html ) fault . 
   result = capital controls , panic , insolvency for italian banks . 
  this eu rule is both idiotic and ill-conceived . 
  it 's not a solution . 
  the rule makes sense . 
  the real issue is with euro . 
  apparently low inflation currency is fundamentally incompatible with italian way of doing things . 
  [ inflation-adjusted gdp was lower in 2014 than 1997 's ] ( https://www.quandl.com/data/oda/ita_ngdprpc-italy-gdp-per-capita-at-constant-prices-lcu ) . 
  given that + balooning debt ( both private and public ) , italy and italian banks are going to default eventually anyway . 
   for them it 's moral hazard above all . 
  those are not empty words . 
  a system where big losses always get socialized has no future . 
  it causes enormous waste as instead of productive investments everyone ` invests ' in bubbles . 
  then the state forces the truly productive entities to cover the losses . 
  this repeats and repeats , so they either leave or join the ` winning ' side . 
  the only way this ends is with total collapse . 
  not just default , but a situation where it turns out there 's nothing productive left . 
  venezuela is currently in that last stage , although their road there was slightly different . 
  that 's what they are designed to protect against , not a relatively small crisis . 
  still it does n't matter , of course they are going to kick the can yet again . 
  they all hope that when it all collapses it 's going to be someone else 's problem . 
  let me guess , clients effectively saying they were too stupid to understand what they were buying and calling not treating them like mentally deficient fraud ? 
  actual fraud would be something like falsely stating the money is insured by the government . 
  they are rapidly destroying their grassroots support in poland with actions like that . 
  just a few years ago , mentioning upa or bandera in context with current ukraine was seen either as russian propaganda or unpragmatic nationalism at best . 
  now it 's a part of acceptable public discourse . 
  it 's not related to any political party or change in government , if i had to pick a turning point i would choose 2015 komorowski 's ( then president of poland ) visit in ukraine during which their parliament declared upa as ` freedom fighters ' . 
  also minor things like a ukrainian student visiting death camp and uploading [ this ] ( http://x0.cdn02.imgwykop.pl/c0834752/01z99dl_dolcuoyfhvfv3cnxidwnsuc36ifmfea9,wat.jpg?author=tomasz-maciejczuk&amp;auth=b914dc01092df92f243237b3840fae5c ) on his facebook or [ a group of ukrainian students in przemy\u015bl posing in the parking lot ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/1a/0a/10/z16821274q,ukrainscy-studenci-panstwowej-wyzszej-szkoly-wscho.jpg ) add up . 
  part of it is due to generational change , young people are most knowledgeable about that part of history . 
   ukraine has the resources and potential to be one of the bigger economies in europe no they do n't . 
  it 's nice to believe that everyone can make it but reality does n't care . 
  ukraine missed the great western turn to outsourcing which lifted most of asia out of abject poverty , now it 's actually starting to reverse thanks to automation . 
  it 's too late . 
  their transport infrastructure is worthless , law enforcement and bureaucracy horrible in all aspects and demographic future even more horrible . 
  [ with ultra-low fertility rates and high death rates , ukraine will experience the single largest absolute population loss in europe between 2011 and 2020 ] ( http://blog.euromonitor.com/2012/05/ukraines-population-in-rapid-decline.html ) . 
  and that prediction was made before the maidan and war in the east !, 
  the minimum pension is [ about $ 38/month ] ( http://blogs.elenasmodels.com/en/salaries-and-costs-of-living-in-ukraine/ ) ( 949 uah ) . 
  how is pension system supposed to survive the ever-worsening demographic collapse ? 
  it just wo n't , they are going to need constant outside aid just to keep old people without big families from starving . 
  if there 's a need for cheap unskilled workers they are going to get working permits for poland and germany . 
  the pay differences are astronomical so there 's not going to be any ` problem ' with people staying home . 
  the more skilled the easier it is for them to emigrate , total brain drain . 
  all that despair is going to lead to yet another pointless revolution ( remember orange revolution ? ), 
  or two , not like it matters at this point . 
  it sounds insanely pessimistic but there really are no positives . 
  ukraine is doomed just like poland was in 1938 .
