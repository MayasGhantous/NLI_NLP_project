  russia could easily cripple their economy if decided that they were n't good friends anymore . 
  yes !, 
  our education system focuses on test solving skills , hence the good results in pisa tests .

  maybe not the whole economy , but the ttip 's isds would be better for us than our current bilateral agreement with us .

  here are [ details and more statistics ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/residence_permits_statistics ) . 
  the arrested man was , as far as i know , what is called white ( if your colourful terminology considers slavs as white ) and , if you look at the religion statistics in poland , probably a catholic . 
  so that 's why i think it 's our ( polish ) cultural heritage now . 
  we had something similar here few days ago . 
  a girl was found with a slit throat and other wounds . 
  luckily she survived . 
  police arrested 21yo man from warsaw . 
  i guess it 's a part of our cultural heritage now .

  and about war with the machines . 
  any text version of this ? 
  i have problems absorbing information from youtube videos ( especially 1 hour long ) . 
  i would say : ban the removal of the chip !, 
  this idea with changing the dna is interesting , but : * it 's too late for some people as over 7bn of them are already past their embryonic phase of development * would n't some ( futuristic ) gene therapy flush ( or replace with other ) this id gene ( s ) from my dna ? 
  what about good , `` old fashioned '' id chips under your skin instead of this ancient technology ? 
  did n't we have here a few days ago an article about falling real wages in uk ? 
  higher birth rates for polish ( and some other immigrant nationalities , i guess ) women in western/northern europe are mainly the result of specific age structure of immigrant groups . 
  in short : birth rates are usually defined for women in age group 15/18-49 but 75 % of births occur in the age group 25-34 . 
  70 % of polish women in uk are in the group 20-39 , so the most reproductive group is overrepresented compared to the local british women and women in poland . 
  no problem , [ they will just use cheaper weapons ] ( http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/06/06-12-feats-of-putin3.w529.h823.jpg ) .

  i guess this is his power nap before the main assault . 
  author of this article [ has published some photos of these works of art on his twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/asluhn ) . 
  reading the title i had a tiny bit of hope that the article is about recent improvements in transport infrastructure in poland , even in the eastern part ( that 's from where putin would come , i guess ) . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  but you have to take into account the level of destruction in poland after ww2 . 
  in 1945 we started from much lower level than southern europe ,, 
   except soviet states to tell the truth the eastern europe also was recovering after ww2 , although using different paths than the rest of the continent . 
  nonetheless the standard of living was rising and event gdp went up . 
  in poland we had serious economic ( and political ) crisis in 80s , so we entered the 90s as one of the poorest countries in europe . 
  i do n't think so , the polish intervention took place after the situation in russia had seriously deteriorated , thanks to civil war and [ russian famine 1601-1603 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_famine_of_1601\u201303 ) . 
   the russian famine of 1601 -- 1603 was russia 's worst famine in terms of proportional effect on the population , killing perhaps two million people , a third of russian people . 
  the commonwealth intervention that has support of sigismund iii started in 1605 . 
  general overview of the period : [ time of troubles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_of_troubles ), 
  are you sure this was not caused by the famine that took place before the commonwealth intervention ? 
  do they know already if the tomb was robbed in the past ? 
  you are not alone . 
  now i know what was all this shouting i heard yesterday evening about . 
   we already produce enough food to feed well over 15 billion people really ? 
  so what these guys from fao are talking about :  by 2050 the world 's population will reach 9.1 billion , 34 percent higher than today . 
  nearly all of this population increase will occur in developing countries . 
  urbanization will continue at an accelerated pace , and about 70 percent of the world 's population will be urban ( compared to 49 percent today ) . 
  income levels will be many multiples of what they are now . 
  ** in order to feed this larger , more urban and richer population , food production ( net of food used for biofuels ) must increase by 70 percent . 
  ** annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today and annual meat production will need to rise by over 200 million tonnes to reach 470 million tonnes . 
  from : [ how to feed the world in 2050 ] ( http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/expert_paper/how_to_feed_the_world_in_2050.pdf ), 
  ... by some beer buddies club , after heavy drinking evening . 
  serious politics . 
  we have one of the highest gdp growth in eu in recent years , and one of the lowest fertility rates . 
  france , sweden . 
  you ca n't compare rates for cities in germany with averaged rates for regions in poland . 
  crime rates in big cities tend to be way higher than in other areas . 
   trade confidence where do they get all these crazy ideas for new indexes ? 
  no , no , you do n't understand . 
  schetyna has ousted sikorski and now it 's time for 2nd season of our local `` house of cards '' . 
  the program is as insane as the party leader . 
  still , `` the doomed sweden '' is and probably will remain in the foreseeable future , better place to live than dynamically developing and culturally homogeneous poland . 
  other option : the convoy will be attacked on ukraine territory by , according to russians , ukraine fascists -  ... -  profit . 
  [ rt seems to be preparing the audience for such scenario ] ( http://rt.com/news/180664-ukraine-russian-humanitarian-convoy/ ) . 
  i remember that braudel mentioned in one of his books about a french plan in late xviii century to introduce wolves again in england in order to severely reduce the englishmen population . 
  although he also listed some serious events involving humans and wolves ( eating children on the streets and so on ) in france , i do n't remember the number of casualties being so high . 
  i suspect that the fear of this animal was greater than the real danger ( nonetheless still existing , but there is the question of its scale ) and hence the idea of this plan to `` invade '' england .

  well if we 're saying about polish government , parliament and various other institutions ( police , secret service etc. 
  ) , it is true that citizens privacy is n't high on their priority lists ( as confirmed by the ruling ) . 
  it 's changing but slowly . 
  have n't played anything from total war series since barbarian invasion , i prefer paradox games . 
  btw with winged hussars you should rather listen to [ bogurodzica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogurodzica ) - it was an anthem-like song in the times of pl commonwealth . 
  the current anthem was written only in the late xviii century . 
  too militaristic in my opinion . 
  waving sabers , marching armies , napoleon etc. 
  melody is ok though . 
  ode to joy is much better , so i 'm hoping for eu federation . 
  and you 're right . 
  wyborcza is second ( or third if we take only paper editions ) , super express ( [ cover ] ( http://cdn10.se.smcloud.net/t/okladki/2014/07/01_2907.jpg ) ) third ( or second ) . 
  i can think of one or two famous russian navy ships currently in foreign territory .
