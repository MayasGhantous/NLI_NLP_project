  so , has this really happened ? 
  i mean cameron saying he will freeze russians assets . 
  i 'm asking because , you know , dailymail ... 
  still it lefts us one of the most religious country in the eu . 
  religiousness of typical believers in other eu countries is probably on the similar level as in poland , but other countries have usually way below 90 % official believers . 
  from [ the eci page , section basic facts ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/basic-facts ) . 
  there are two main requirements : * at least 1 million signatures in whole eu * at least 7 countries have to collect more than predefined tresholds, 
  i do n't think so . 
  first you need a million signatures , not a small number and it 's not easy to get it through facebook fanpages . 
  second , only adults can sign ( in austria 16 years old ) so sites like kwejk.pl wo n't help you much . 
  i suppose that the large number of signatures in poland was mainly collected by organizations like `` wolne konopie '' ( free cannabis ) or political party supporting the initiative ( tw\u00f3j ruch ) , that have some structures in real-life . 
  and at the same time , the number of people regularly ( every sunday ) going to church is falling . 
  the average for 2013 is 39 % of all formal members of catholic church . 
  kids these days ... 
  if you do n't want to choose the lesser evil , vote for [ the greater one ] ( http://wybierz-wieksze-zlo.pl/votes/wybierz_wieksze_zlo_karta_01.jpg ) . 
  and let 's not forget about the most interesting group from the `` liber '' set : the libertines . 
  thanks for expressing your opinion on the topic by editing the title . 
  someone with other point of view could change it to something like `` france tries to protect its small bookstores from the dumping practices of large online retailers '' . 
  there are of course pros and cons of this solution . 
  if you see it like that , although if you read the article carefully , you will find the fragment saying that the church exerts its influence through the mps with conservative views , who are majority in the polish parliament , so it does n't say the country is n't a democracy . 
  but beside that the church uses other ways to save ( or even extend ) its strong position gained after 1989 , and about one such way tells this article . 
   sexual education you mean there is this `` family life '' subject ? 
  turning it upside-down solves most of these problems . 
  well , here too he 's a hero to a large group of people . 
  i wonder if we will see him on the list of some political party in the next year elections . 
  his story is different . 
  he performed abortions without a protest when there was less restrictions ( before 1993 ) . 
  later , as he claims , he changed his mind about the topic . 
  they were in [ non-aligned movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-aligned_movement ) . 
  us would be more like canada i guess , only bigger ( in population size ) . 
  this [ perfectly credible picture ( nsfw ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2pb2q.png ) from the depths of the internet confirms that he did . 
  we have similar situation after wwii when the westward shift of our borders was hailed not as war gains ( or as a recompensation for the loss of our poor and troubled lands on the east #thanksiosif ) but as a return to our rightful territories from the times of piasts ( dynasty that ruled poland 10th-14th century ) . 
  this ignored the existence of various demographical and political changes that had occurred before the 1945 ( for example german colonization of territories east of the oder river ) , similarly like this articles does this in case of the history of ukraine . 
   polish occupiers u wot m8 ? 
  still not illegal if the favors were n't personal , and from what i know they were n't . 
  the government resigned from something and the national bank gave something - looks like a normal political deal between two independent institutions . 
   sienkiewicz spoke about doing illegal stuff what illegal stuff ? 
  from what i 've read earlier he talked with belka about introducing quantitative easing as a one of tools of the national bank for stimulating growth . 
  something new occurred ? 
  then you should make your statement more precise . 
  like `` any country in the world would mass their troops on its border with a ** region ** in civil war '' . 
  well , not really , we are n't doing that . 
  although the west of ukraine ( bordering poland ) is quite calm compared with the east . 
  news are overrated . 
  there is overproduction of it , abundance of sources and at the same time decline of importance and quality . 
  the chart is also [ published ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist/photos/a.10150279872209060.361054.6013004059/10152488528689060/ ) on economist 's facebook page, 
  alternatives for the current government are even worse , this is the real shame of polish politics . 
  copying not destroying ? 
  have n't i heard cries that secret services trying to hide something that has n't been published yet ? 
  copying is n't going to help them with it . 
   he claimed that it [ abortion ] is against his conscience interestingly he has performed abortion procedures many times when the law was more liberal ( communism times ) . 
  so , how many turul statues do you have in hungary ? 
  i do n't remember this info was there when i first read the article . 
  it 's possible i overlooked it , maybe they added something . 
  yes , and this is the communism substance that is coming out of his wee wee . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/krakow,50/sikajacy-lenin-w-krakowie-pis-protestuje-zalozylismy-mu-prezerwatywe,438788.html ) article ( in polish ) the statue has been already moved indoors , supposedly in accordance with the earlier agreed schedule . 
  so the fun has ended . 
  nowa huta is not a town it 's a district of krakow ( though some local sentiments in the `` old krakow '' as well as in nowa huta present it as a separate entity ) . 
  and the `` urinating lenin '' afaik is a temporary installation , part of the artboom festival , so it 's not going to stay . 
  personally i think it looks great and brings some humour into generally dull landscape , but the statue already has caught the attention of the usual defenders of `` traditional values '' and is accused of propagating communism . 
  i 'm not particularly fond of vodka . 
  this recent one from eurovision , about slavs and with busty milkmaids , i do n't remember the title . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ), 
  jan olbracht ( john i albert ) . 
  there is this saying about him that his reign saw the extinction of polish nobility . 
  sadly it was n't the truth but i am grateful to him for trying ( unintentionally but still ) . 
  are these new jobs for humans ? 
  or rather 1792 , 1794 , 1830 , 1863 , 1939 etc. 
  i do n't see any leading theme in the campaign here , mostly parties fighting each other . 
  there was some more talk about security ( energy security in europe especially ) due to the situation in ukraine , but i would n't say it 's a main topic . 
  and as always minor parties add some unexpected viewpoints to the debate : [ one recent example ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/9fcfca04193ce063d63c870817ee3176,641,0,0,0.png ) ( the caption translates roughly as `` no to homo '' , and no , word `` homo '' does n't stand for latin `` human '' here ), 
  of course you mean the observable universe . 
  as for the rest ... 
  it 's hard for native polish speakers too , sure we all learn some version of it from childhood , but it 's very rare to meet somebody who can speak without mistakes , obeying all the language rules . 
  i did n't know there are catholic holidays on 1st and 3rd may , these days are always mentioned in media as labor and constitution days . 
  it started from economy but now it 's also a political union . 
  ceu aka upper house is made from ministers from eu countries , do they get any additional money for their job in this body ? 
  ukrainian army is apparently trying to take control of sloviansk . 
  five separatists died in the shootings outside of the city . 
  yes . 
  there is a list of places at the end of the video . 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about these `` beautiful country/region/place '' movies . 
  on the one hand they 're nice to watch , but on the other i am aware that locations are highly cherrypicked and movies are carefully edited to avoid any unpleasant views , which in effect gives the feeling of slight falseness . 
  nope . 
  even with this additional money we are in the eu second league by military spending . 
  i doubt this 4bn euros per year will be simply added to the current level of spending , it will be rather partially taken from the military budget in order to get the overall number slightly above theoretical nato treshold of 2 % of gdp ( currently we are at 1.8-1 .9 % iirc ), 
   if the four parties win the september elections which according to polls is not going to happen , or am i wrong ? 
  european parliament competences are clearly defined . 
  strengthening putin could be done for example by killing ttip , which lies within these competences . 
  that 's nice but how ? 
  there is no pipeline from iran to europe or am i missing one ? 
  so we need serious investments to build it ( through turkey i guess ) . 
  i have n't heard about iranian infrastructure and fleet for lng export - so this route probably also needs sizable funds before it can works . 
  i think it 's like with others alternatives for russian gas , it 's several years away . 
  10/12 of your links is from `` comment is free '' section which is by design a place less strict than the rest of the newspaper . 
  these are more like blog posts and opinions of various people ( most of them do n't even work for guardian afaik ) . 
  from the [ description of the section ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/help/2008/jun/03/1 ) :  on comment is free , we host hundreds of discussions every week on a wide range of topics , from across the world . 
  we publish a plurality of voices , but our centre of gravity as a progressive , liberal , left-leaning newspaper is clear . 
  i understand that the second part of the last sentence ( after `` but '' ) is equal to communist manifesto for some people . 
  it was n't so evident in other articles about russia , eastern europe before the maidan and crimea .
