  where is the inaccuracy ? 
  besides lithuania in all mentioned cases the polish state , together with other partner divided some other country and took some land . 
  do you want to say that this was n't a partition because in most of the cases there was a significant polish population in taken territory ( except germany ) , like in crimea case ? 
  the only joke part is that we love it . 
  not anymore i hope . 
  what ? 
  we love it !, 
  in 20th century we took part in partitions of : * ukraine ( together with ussr ) * belarus ( with ussr ) * lithuania ( well , this was actually land grab ) * czechoslovakia ( with 3rd reich ) * germany ( with allies ) edit : formatting,

  in poland you 're not a man if you ca n't drink at least 1/2 litre of vodka per day .

  nato has prepared [ plans ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/wikileaks-cable-exposes-nato-war-plan-against-russia/22349 ) for defense against russian attack . 
  bad news is we have to give some ground before the strong defensive line can be created in pirenees . 
  1 % is number from 2005 , the newest eurobarometer poll from 2010 gives 5 % atheists for poland . 
  check the wikipedia source page from one of comments below . 
  from what i see the graphs are from 2005 poll . 
  the data on wikipedia page are from 2010 . 
   catholic church accepts evolution well , that does n't mean catholics accept it too .

  i do n't know hot it has changed ( and in which direction ) since then .

  short summary from news stream on [ wyborcza.pl ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/relacje/1,126862,15300590,kijow_burzy_sie_po_uchwaleniu_restrykcyjnego_prawa.html ) ( polish newspaper ) : protesters are occupying public buildings in lviv , rivne , ternopil , ivano-fankivsk ( all western ukraine ) . 
  other news from the same source : the governor of volyn oblast ( western ukraine ) has resigned , forced by protesters, 
  poland can not into science funding . 
  i guess polish church also does n't know what the term `` gender '' means . 
  they 've created their own definition , have thrown there all the scary ( for them ) things like feminism , homosexuality etc. , and transmitted it to their public . 
  now `` gender '' together with `` the civilization of death '' ( abortion , euthanasia ) are simple banners used in ideological fight . 
  it 's easier to say for example that gay marriage is evil because it 's part of some evil genderrrr ideology , than to explain why the union of two men is wrong from the perspective of the not very coherent catholic doctrine . 
  the recent church obsession with the word `` gender '' resulted in some interesting works , examples : * [ the first photo of gender ] ( http://deser.pl/deser/51,111858,15200534.html?i=1 ) * [ stop bender ideology ] ( http://deser.pl/deser/51,111858,15200534.html?i=16 ) * [ the exorcism of gender ] ( http://www.polityka.pl/galerie/1558745,9,rysuje-jan-koza.read ),

  there is a fragment about magnificent century , its popularity in greece and right-wing protests against it . 
   there are no scientific assessments confirming gmos are safe for the environment and people . 
  thanks for including this untrue statement from the article into the title . 
  that shows that both italy government ( if they used something like that as justification in this case ) and trueactivist do n't mind questioning broad scientific consensus about safety of gmo foods allowed into market , when it suits their purposes , whatever they are . 
  i wonder what is their stance on climate change . 
  [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/jwsml61dymi?t=36m ) from the incident . 
  you did n't mention one funny ( or some would say strange ) incident that shows that poland in fact is in some aspects a special country . 
  it started previous week but continued into the current one . 
  in radom , city in central poland , new police chief ordered to remove crosses ( i mean catholic religious symbols that hang on the walls in many places in poland , even in the parliament ) from his office and two others public rooms in police . 
  this started a series of interesting events . 
  anonymous group of policemen write a complain , saying that their new chief is rude , uncivil and last but not least , he does not believe in god . 
  the complain was sent among others to regional police hq and to local bishop ( they know who has the real power here ) . 
  the case gained interest of right wing politicians always ready to defend the faith against mounting armies of atheism . 
  especially eager in this fight was well-known mp '' [ agent tomek ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/32/9d/c5/z12950834q,zdjecie-wykonano-29-lipca-2009-r---o-godz-10-54--t.jpg ) '' , who sent his own complains to various central offices and accused radom 's police chief of insulting the religious feelings of his subordinates ( in polish law this crime can put you in jail for two years ) . 
  the accused police chief came back from his holiday and had to explain what happened to his superiors . 
  he also wrote an open letter explaining his actions . 
  i do n't want to break any special bond ( although i 'm not really sure if such thing really exists , beside the saying mentioned in the picture i 've seen little proof to support it ) with hungary , but i have impression that in poland in recent years this phrase `` pole and hungarian cousins be ... '' has been almost exclusively appropriated by right wing supporters , who , in that way , express their strong desire to `` orbanize '' this country . 
  the leader of right wing opposition ( who currently leads in polls ) said some time ago that `` there will be budapest in warsaw '' , hinting at what type of politics he wants to introduce if he wins elections . 
  later he many times has expressed his admiration for hungary 's pm . 
  there are also that strange groups that go to sponsored by orban party trips to hungary to wave polish flags during some official events , there are football hooligans ( by definition extreme right wing ) that loudly say about their brotherhood with hungarians . 
  i 'm not sure if this is how it works from hungarian side , but i 'm afraid that this saying ( and this alleged bond ) is becoming compromised ( at least in some part of society ) , by narrowing its use to express support between right wing groups in both countries . 
  why did you edit the title of the article ? 
  it does n't say about riots after the legalization , only about police preparation for possible violent outcome . 
  all photos of clashes come from the protests that took place before the legalization and as [ bbc describes it ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494 ) : `` although rallies opposing the change have been overwhelmingly peaceful , there have been some clashes , blamed on far-right elements . '', 
  if this picture is true i 'm not sure if this can be called riots . 
  no , there is no playing here , it 's only some bullshit that got out from the not-entirely-rational mind ( my personal opinion ) of our minister of justice . 
  the anti-german sentiment is sometimes used by right wing opposition but i 'm not sure it can be called nazi card . 
  poland was also added yesterday ( earlier only the biggest cities had coverage ) . 
  in one of polish clinics an empty container used for storing frozen embryos for [ ivf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_vitro_fertilisation ) has been found . 
  polish justice minister jaros\u0142aw gowin ( devout catholic and strong opponent of ivf ) deduced from this fact that there is an underground embryos trade , that probably thousands of human beings lost their lives in result ( for him frozen embryo equals human being ) and that experiments was conducted on missing embryos by those evil ... germans . 
  no proof of these claims has been presented . 
  [ german embassy has reacted recently ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/133659,poland-and-germany-in-embryo-experiments-row ), 
  what do you mean by insane ? 
  they are n't that high , at least comparing with the rest of europe . 
  i 'm sure many people took the deep , philosophical approach to this question and wondered how long it will take for humans to get to mars . 
  kudos for the kid who got it correct . 
  i 'm sure you can . 
  i did n't want to suggest there is no difference whatsoever . 
  sure , you have higher sentences in such cases and they are more often , but here ( in poland , but i guess in some other european countries too ) you can also be sentenced for only saying something about religion . 
  we are not so different : [ polish singer convicted for `` offending religious sensibilities '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doda_ ( singer \\ ) #blasphemy _ charges ), 
  is it possible that this tangible effects on productivity etc. 
  was caused by the decrease in value of euro due to the financial crisis , that made german products and services cheap for the rest of the world ? 
  does this doctrine prevent europe from being nuked ? 
  i do n't mean entirely but similarly to japan and the end of ww2 . 
  the sheer cost of planned invasion of main japanese islands was also considered to be enormous , so usa tried the other way first and it worked . 
  i have exactly the same thoughts and that 's why i signed this . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) no . 
  it 's not only balkan thing - as far as i know lithuania forbids bi-lingual street name signs in the areas inhabited by polish minority . 
  i think ( though i 'm not really sure ) this could be characteristic for small ( by population number ) nations that have recently regained independence and are afraid of loosing their cultural identity . 
  i agree . 
  making the poll in the midst of the financial crisis probably has huge influence on the results . 
  i think this reasoning has a lot of sense , there is a lot of similarities between poland-ukraine ( and to some degree belarus ) situation and western countries-their colonies . 
  you mentioned colonization actions ( this also took place not only in interbellum period but also in xvi-xviii century ) i would add also oppressing the local population , some brutal episodes when the colonial system fell ( in that case during ww2 and immediately after ) and the current situation when many ukrainians come to poland for ( rather low wage ) work . 
  there are groups in poland that romanticize the image of ukraine under polish rule ( as a some kind of our wild west ) , some feel nostalgia for the lost lands . 
  i guess this is quite similar to some situations and views in the west . 
  the major difference is the lack of sea/ocean between poland and ukraine . 
   in the name of polish nation we apologize ... 
  so who exactly are you ? 
  for now i do n't see any mandate only big words put into highly compressed and thus blurred image .
