  have you read my first comment at all ? 
  and what am i suggesting ? 
  it was n't during the protests , just two guys talking ( loud enough to be heard by others ) in a tram in krak\u00f3w . 
  i 'm not going to try to convince you ( impossible `` on the internet '' ) but i can add i was quite surprised too . 
  i had read earlier that people are saying this ( well , i had n't heard the part about soap till then ) on facebook or in comments section , but you know , it 's the internet - kids , attention whores etc. 
  seeing someone saying this few meters from you was , at least for me , quite shocking . 
  and i 'm generally accustomed to verbal racism - my family is from the eastern poland countryside , many older people from there are n't afraid of expressing their strong opinions about jews , but still , they usually do n't say about burning people in ovens again . 
  you might be on to something - today in a tram i heard two 40 + yo guys talking about refugees . 
  their proposals : move them to auschwitz , then to ovens and make soap of them . 
  i do n't even ... 
  with this wave of support they will get 100 % or even 200 % more seats in the next parliament . 
  i think we need a megathread for articles about various plagues ( economic/political/natural ) that descend on russia . 
  soviet republics shown separately but czechoslovakia as a one country ? 
  yugoslavia in eastern bloc ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  as a citizen of krakow , i have to admit that the perspective of being ruled from vienna instead of warsaw is enticing . 
  are you sure it 's left-wing ? 
  i remember that jkm was one of columnists there for some time . 
  and i know at least two people that read this magazine 's jokes literally , not as a satire on polish stereotypes . 
  probably more people in poland also do n't get it . 
  c'mon battle of orsha was n't pyrrhic - see the wikipedia article you linked , section aftermath . 
  it was properly used , allowed to sing a peace with habsburgs and avoid a difficult situation . 
  smolensk looks important , but rather from the perspective of few hundreds years , unavailable to the people of that times . 
  160 km/h means upgraded value , it 's the highest speed trains can travel in poland , save for the part of the line between warsaw and silesia which allows 200 km/h . 
  hope for what ? 
   they are fully integrated yes and it 's a shame that some elements of the local polish population , evidently supporters of recently popular in this country idea that every muslim is a terrorist , want suddenly to show them `` their place '' . 
  there was a devastation of their mosque last year and surge in hate speech . 
  afaik several people were arrested but i 'm not sure if they got any sentences . 
  eh , i do n't like to be in a position of a defender of gw because i do n't read it that often ( and only online ) , i do n't like it , i hate some of their journalists , but still , the picture this newspaper has in some groups is so caricatured that sometimes i ca n't hold back . 
  so ...  almost monopoly what do you understand by that term then ? 
  because if you look [ here ] ( http://www.ujk.edu.pl/ibib/studia/pdf/152/dlaczego_polacy.pdf ) in 1990 there were 83 newspapers in poland with total daily circulation of 5.6 million , where gw was selling in that year below 400 thousands . 
  you can read there also that in 1990-1993 poles experimented with many new titles , what resulted in rapidly changing market . 
   rzeczpospolita niche it had almost 300 thousands in sales 94 , do n't know earlier number , but it hardly looks like niche . 
   [ government ? 
  subsrciptions ] significantly boost their sales look at latest [ numbers ] ( http://www.wirtualnemedia.pl/artykul/sprzedaz-gazet-w-kioskach-wzrost-super-expressu-fakt-liderem-mocno-w-dol-dziennik-gazeta-prawna ) . 
  without subscriptions ( do n't know how many of them are private ones ) they are still high , behind two tabloids ( who would subscribe a tabloid ? 
  ) , and their proportion of sales by subscriptions is much lower than for example dgp or rzeczpospolita . 
  i know that this conviction about gw being government propaganda machine heavily supported by tons of taxpayers ' money is quite popular ( again , among certain groups of people ) , but did you think for a moment , that this subscriptions are results of still quite high popularity . 
   it says absolutely nothing about another 90 % yes , this brings even more solid evidence for the `` very hated '' statement . 
   first non-commie newspaper that 's true , but  almost monopolising the press market in poland in the 90s what ? 
  leading position is n't monopoly . 
  `` rzeczpospolita '' , that for a long time was something like conservative counterpart of gw , became independent also in 1989 , not to mention lots of other newspapers starting or changing their character in that time . 
  and still , despite of decline of gw 's sales : the second biggest does n't mean `` very hated '' . 
  the context of this citation indicates that we 're talking about the current polish state , 3rd republic or whatever is the correct name . 
  really ? 
  it 's the second biggest daily newspaper so your personal view about it being `` very hated '' is n't so widely shared . 
  the newspaper is hated though , but by certain groups mainly ( but not exclusively ) from right side of political spectrum , as you forgot to mention . 
  and from what i see the article is n't from gazeta wyborcza , it 's written for guardian by a journalist working for gw . 
  just informing man , do n't take it personally . 
  new data from 2015 ( see my previous comment ) show that the difference is 24000 vs 26000,

  what is wrong with this site ? 
  it claims that 2015 gdp in poland will be 10 % lower than in 2014 . 
  is there something i do n't know ? 
  so this is replaced with / r/europeans now ? 
  not sure if it makes sense , i suppose participants of that subreddit are well aware of different `` masterraces '' . 
  or is it / r/european ( without `` s '' ) ? 
  i always forget . 
  our historical experiences are n't that similar . 
  you landed in relatively modern ( at least since xviii century ) austrian empire , we had our archaic nobles republic with elements of anarchy . 
  and czech lands have been always more cities and mining ( later industry ) oriented , poland has been rather agricultural country with weak cities and industry . 
   / int/olerants too much 4chan man , take a break from time to time . 
  remember at least to call your dad today ( hint : father 's day ) . 
   the probe tweeted the message , `` hello earth !, 
  can you hear me ? '', 
  really bbc ? 
  i guess '' \u015bmiech\u0142em '' which is grammatically incorrect translation of `` i laughed '' with a timespan of the laugh being infinitesimally short . 
  it 's competing now with newer `` skis\u0142em '' which roughly translates to `` i 've just fermented '' ( fermented as in sauerkraut ) . 
  xd is also quite popular and there are cases that it transpires to the spoken language as its phonetic interpretation : `` iksde '' . 
  actually it 's suburbanization . 
  the highest growth rate have areas around big cities . 
  there are chances that this can be reverted yet , but still the ban is planned to enter into force only since 2018 . 
  the article goes in a strange direction pointing finger mainly at big coal power plants and criticizing the ( weak tbh ) attempts to combat low-stack emissions . 
  whereas coal plants have cut emissions by a large margin , the individual sources of heating are still the main problem in many polish cities . 
  we do n't have quality standards of what kind of coal can be used at home and often it 's coal with various additions ( garbage ) that is burned by people . 
  the latter is illegal but the enforcement has been laughable so far . 
  compared with the rest of europe we 're extremely religious . 
  half of believers in average european country also goes to church on rare occasions , but there the overall number of religious people is closer to 50 % ( on average ) not 100 % like here . 
  and what 's after '' ... '' ? 
  all polish a4 and later a5 are planned to be upgraded to a new 2pl standard . 
  i 'm not sure if there is a final concept of this upgrade yet but from what i read it should bring old tanks closer to the a6 capabilities . 
  yes , i heard they come down from the mountains from time to time and pillage northern italy . 
  what 's the start date here ? 
  june 1941 or earlier one , that includes loses from the winter war ? 
  we had pretty well organized action of distributing lugol 's iodine mainly among children to prevent absorbing some radioactive isotopes . 
  i was few years old then but still remember that awful taste of blue liquid they gave us . 
  it 's very dangerous , standing on the rotating ladder hold by two people . 
  the canonical solution is to stand on a table rotated by four people . 
  the rich have private roads ? 
  where ? 
  this study gives some concrete numbers . 
  it was n't certain what was the characteristic of the anglo-saxon `` invasion '' , did they mix with romano-british locals , or wiped them out , or there were only few german invaders but they culture and language spread widely . 
  now the theory about substantial number of german `` invaders '' that did n't abstain from mixing with locals gets more support . 
  [ soon !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psaeplkmbfy ), 
  it 's not like you 're only on the losing side . 
  the deal was we get the development funds and your much more advanced and wealthier than our companies the free access to market with 100 millions population . 
  the large part of this new manufacturing power ( and some part of gains from it ) is n't owned by the host countries , but by the capital from `` old europe '' . 
  not the ukrainian refugees but migrant workers and generally without question whether they 're working legally , or getting at least minimum wage . 
  as for the real ukrainian refugees , most of the asylum requests are rejected .
