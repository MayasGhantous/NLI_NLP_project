you can not point such thing in quran https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4fj7jk/switzerland_suspends_the_citizenship_process_for/d29dym8, 
  and it 's really telling that this confusion happened in the past even to such newspapers like [ `` le figaro '' and `` le monde '' ] ( http://www.wirtualnemedia.pl/artykul/francuski-blad ) . 
   they even mentioned it 's pathetic and telling that europe so far has n't created even 1 tech-giant like google , microsoft , facebook or twitter . 
  sap is the 3rd biggest software company in the world with higher revenue than facebook . 
  bijstand is welfare for people with no income or income too low to survive . 
  no much better in the netherlands : https://i.imgur.com/dqta8d4.png, 
  + irregular stress position . 
  it 's not hussars , it 's our [ coat of arms ] ( http://www.everydaynodaysoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/poland-coat-of-arms.jpg ) . 
  i would n't be surprised at all if he was . 
  after all , we had [ a prayer for rain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbt21orgne ) in our parliamentary chapel 10 years ago . 
  you forgot the minister of environment who [ believes in chemtrails ] ( http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/polityka/artykuly/505166,kpia-z-jana-szyszki-interpelacja-chemitrails.html ) . 
  told by ronald reagan : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn3z3esvg7a&amp;t=2m13s,

   grammar vocabulary, 
  doublethink . 
  just for the sake of clarity , we do not capitalize names of months in polish . 
  yes , you 're correct . 
  if you have more specific question i would suggest that you post them in / r/learnpolish, 
  if you 'd like to say it 100 % correct you should use the vocativ form of the nouns : `` dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 , bardzo przystojny m\u0119\u017cczyzno lub pi\u0119kna kobieto '', 
  what 's your problem ? 
  the official name of auschwitz by unesco is `` german nazi concentration and extermination camp '' , like it or not . 
  conservative socially and liberal economically . 
   there are left-wing as well as right-wing ultras groups that 's how it is in germany ( st. pauli comes to my mind ) but in poland ultras are almost exclusively ( far ) right-wing with the small exception of some of polonia warszawa supporters . 
  out of curiosity , can you distinguish between ` trzy ' and ` czy ' when listening and speaking ? 
  a colleague of mine , who is an arab but after over 10 years in poland speaks almost on native level , told me this was one of the things he 'd struggled for the longest time as he could n't hear the difference between the two , not to mention pronouncing them correctly . 
  how is your polish grammar anyway ? 
  i 've been always wondering what it is like to learn cases when your native language does n't have them at all . 
  but you 've omitted one ` z ' . 
  what currency issues ? 
  i think she was simply just really pissed off with go\u0142ota over [ the disgraceful end of his fight with tyson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abtb63fkjy0&amp;t=540s ) and she did n't actually mean that . 
  but the netherlands require you to renounce your other citizenship when you get the dutch one ? 
  actually it 's more than one church : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_catholic_churches#list_of_eastern_churches, 
  and ukraine, 
  wikipedia has a quite good article on that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0141#polish note that the difference between ` l' and ' \u0142 ' is not merely historical and can change the meaning of a word completely , e.g. 
  ` laska ' means ' a walking stick ' while ' \u0142aska ' means ` mercy ' . 
  i think the letter \u0141 is something that can be compared to what you described about the dutch r but the other way round . 
  it used to sound softer , close to l but nowadays it 's a much more distinct sound , like the english w in ` wow ' . 
  there are some exceptions but generally  people who want to acquire dutch nationality through naturalisation are , as a rule , required to give up their other nationality if possible . 
  but the netherlands do n't allow for dual nationality ? 
  i think it 's [ another one ] ( http://pobierak.jeja.pl/images/e/4/6/236768_kiedy-musisz-posilic-sie-kebsem-u.jpg ) gaining popularity recently . 
  it 's also interesting that our eastern neighbors have adopted and use the motto themselves : http://arctus.livejournal.com/181254.html, 
  i do n't see any other reason to register apart from voting . 
  i only had to register with the local municipality . 
   according to me its better for a country to focus on working then on complaining . 
  and that is [ what we do ] ( http://lifestylewellnessstudios.com/uploads/3/4/5/2/34522724/1_orig.jpg ) . 
  what would be the plural form in turkish ? 
  i 'm surprised by such a low percentage , considered the number of spaniards i 've worked with in poland and the netherlands . 
  literally the most numerous group of foreigners . 
  but maybe it 's just it specific . 
  you are right , as a pole living and working in the netherlands i did n't register in the polish embassy , i do n't see why i should . 
  where did you go ? 
   they told me that poland is backward country compared to the west and nothing special is here . 
  said also that `` poland is not in europe '' it looks like a common sentiment amongst turks :  i do n't think east europeans should feel pride over european civilization , since they didi n't contribute that much to it . 
  it 's sort of cringy and sad . 
   krakow ( krakow ) is awesome !, 
  also known as krakow . 
  here you can see polish media and their owners ( from the top to the bottom : tv , radio , web portals , newspapers , weeklies ) : https://static1.money.pl/i/h/74/art377930.jpg local press and gossip magazines : https://static1.money.pl/i/h/160/oryg378528.jpg,

  they 're simply janitors with a fancier name .

   does romania have rakija they have palinc\u0103 . 
  that reminds me of a joke : \\ - fries please . 
  \\ - unfortunately we 've run out of potatoes . 
  \\ - no problem , you can serve team with bread . 
  yes , if you have speech disorder . 
   but we have cruzifixe in classrooms [ so do we ] ( https://tobrze.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/szkola.jpg ), 
  i work with two romanians . 
  looking at their diet and activity i 'm quite sure they 'll contribute to this map . 
  are you thirsty too ?

   they hate western europe and dont want to integrate . 
  oh , for a moment i thought you were talking about muslim migrants . 
   because the few dozen flown in by private charity institutions fled to germany already . 
  not only this , some of them have requested their refugee status in poland to be revoked as it prevents them from getting benefits in germany : http://www.rp.pl/uchodzcy/303289891-syryjczycy-nie-chca-byc-uchodzcami-w-polsce.html, 
  our media report problems the polish minority in lithuania has like being forced to use lithuanian spelling of polish names or being fined for using polish names of streets so maybe that is the reason of the score . 
  personally i do n't have anything against you . 
  it looks like the last year you were included was 2013 when you were 17th ( 38 % / 29 % / 17 % / 16 % ) , see page 6 : http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2013/k_012_13.pdf that 's quite high number of `` hard to say '' answers , we really do n't know much about you ( and vice versa i suppose ) : /, 
  in 2016 you held the 17th position : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg, 
  last year you were on the 11th place : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg, 
  your score last year was 46 % / 31 % / 14 % / 9 % ( 5th position ) : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg, 
  [ marek papa\u0142a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marek_papa\u0142a ) polish chief of police killed in broad daylight in front of his house . 
  the papa\u0142a contract killing is widely regarded as the most serious unsolved crime involving former communist security services sb , high-ranking members of the government , and the mafia , since poland 's transition to democracy in 1989 . 
  the murder of [ piotr jaroszewicz ] , a former communist prime minister , and his wife . 
  i would have a hard choice between legalizing soft drugs and abortion on demand . 
  so who took the rest ? 
  haha , i remember my foreign colleague telling me how long it took him to get the difference between ` trzy ' and ` czy ' . 
  while another foreign colleague listening to this said he could not hear any difference . 
  there is a formula but it has nothing to do with overstatying . 
  for a country to qualify to the visa waiver program ** a visitor ( b ) visa refusal rate ** must be [ below three percent ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visa-waiver-program.html ) . 
  the catch is , this entirely depends on us officials who arbitrarily decide whether to grant or refuse a visa . 
  we 're not even in [ the top ten overstaying nationalities ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/03/homeland-security-produces-first-estimate-of-foreign-visitors-to-u-s-who-overstay-deadline-to-leave/ ) . 
  is us going to impose visas on germany , italy and uk ? 
  please abolish visas . 
  in polish you would say `` jest du\u017co / wielu polak\u00f3w '' , where `` jest '' means `` there is '' . 
  - what is the boar doing in the castle ? 
  - exploring dungeons . / having sex with sows . 
  that makes sense , thanks .
