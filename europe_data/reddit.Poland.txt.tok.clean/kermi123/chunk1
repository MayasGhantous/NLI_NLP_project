as i know polish are treated the worst from all nations in lithuania . 
  i mean ... nowadays . 
  are you sure ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8m8xn0hzhy i 've been on protests in gda\u0144sk , there was n't so much people as in krak\u00f3w ( 30k ) but i think there could be about 3-5k . 
  thank you mariusz . 
  in most cases they are probably widows living without children . 
  everyone can buy a ship in a mall . 
  it 's not only about lyrics . 
  great ammount of people singing together patriotic song is amazing . 
  i 'm so proud of being polan when i see over 60,000 people singing polish anthem [ a capella ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpwz-hbpk_e ), 
  a couple of muslims is enough to fly into a skyscraper . 
  2 days ago it was 20 % less to poland and yestarday 45 % less, 
  true . 
  and i think that we leant about that in school . 
  but again ... ottoman empire and [ 1683 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ), 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka is russian . 
  i 'm also against ue for some time , but i was for it . 
  first of all westeners think of easteners as people who seek for their jobs , but they do n't know or they even do n't care that west corporations are destroying our market and they are paying much lower wages than would local company , but they are leading on the local market and others go bankrupt . 
  for example farmers , as i know personally some , are telling that in poland before eu was better , even if they got donations their products are for lower prices because for example we can not sell as much milk as we would without eu , because other countries have to sell theirs . 
  benefits from donations are only for huge farms which would be healthy even without them . 
  additionally germany is trying to force others to do what they want , they firstly tell you what you shoul do , than when you fail they buy you out ( greece ) i 'm tired of listening how we are retarded and we are idiots because we do n't change our society to show you how we are pro homo and multiculti , and shit ... we are retarded catholics ( 120 % of our nation ) . 
  i 'm taliking about west medias and commentators , every foreigner i met were nice people ( except some muricans in mall throwing everywhere a food , disrespect ) and i 'm sorry that because of my english limitations i could n't show you my full iritation . 
  although you are defending yourself ... why ? 
  do n't they deserve for equal life ? 
  there is excellent proverb for this situation , ` prevention is better than cure . ', 
  shall we wait firstly for any violations ? 
  we could compare it to invasion ... withouth tanks . 
  in australia you may not have any ground borders , but here in europe you should not allow cross your border by any foreign . 
  they are crossing our borders in thousands . 
  can you even imagine this situation 50 years ago on the border between eastern and western europe ? 
  than on the borders were tanks , now there are bottles with water . 
  how are those rights in australia being violated ? 
  do you have right to shoot to refugees ? 
  it 's the same . 
  pff , poland here , education free , we got some private universities but they are seen as worse , so most recognized universities are public and free . 
  i 'm only paying for not passed exams . 
  you are right , but eastern europeans are more grateful that refugees wo n't cross closed borders from the west  btw : finland is so far west , that i ca n't find it on my map , maybe shall i look in another direction ? 
  my friend was pro immigrant and i was arguing with him . 
  today he is in greece , and he has totally changed his mind . 
  there are plenty people who lie everywhere on the ground , they stink and do nothing , probably waiting for better life . 
  edit : greece description - as my friend is relationing it to me . 
  poland , spain , czech , iceland . 
  some years ago it would look different , 
  i 'm proud !, 
  oh , i did n't notice that . 
  people who sought asylum are now in western europe , people who are now in eastern europe are people who did n't seek for western life or did n't achive it . 
  so , still ... ` how is that hypocritical ? ', 
  i 've got polo , check again if your is safe, 
  poland was trying to do this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sylwester_kaliski this article has more details in polish . 
  it was in a secret from ussr to develop our own nuclear weapon . 
  and there is rumor that in 90s we had about 170 nukes from ussr . 
  in poland customer is obligated to get receipt . 
  if i 'm not wrong you can pay fine if you do n't take it , but no one cares . 
  really ? 
  i 'm polish and the most opposed people , that i know due to gay marriage are also against polish church . 
  i do n't support gay marriages and i do n't oppose it , let them marry , but i do n't like their gay parades which are awful . 
  man in pink feathers with make up ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1le8kipqt5i edit : generalization of islam ? 
  they call themselves ` normal ' not extermists , but they approve extermist 's values . 
  any source ? 
  you can use it in every place in sentence , it is always correct ( not political ) . 
  many polish people call it as a polish coma . 
  and it means whore , but you can say it as / u/bunhque wrote . 
  this is one word which means everything . 
  kurwa , come here . 
  come kurwa here . 
  come here kurwa . 
  as you want , wherever you want . 
  as i know today were 3 terrorist attacks in france , tunisia and kuwait . 
  personally i would 'em igrate ' for a year or so just to ` polish my english ' , but i do n't want or need to work abroad . 
  i 'm good here . 
  but i 've heard that americans do celebrate my name day - saint patrick 's day . 
  yeah !, 
  edit : and in poland we rather celebrate name day . 
  `` polish death camps '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxhltkqufpg, 
  oh , my bad sorry . 
  last time i had a history lesson was in a high school and i 'm not sure if i even was learning about this event there . 
  as aerospacemonkey was mentioning 1618 and i knew that this event had been in xvii i 've mentioned about this above , but now i see that i was wrong . 
  poland defeated russian army many times , russian army defeated polish army also many times . 
  we had a long history of battles . 
  but 1618 is a year , when poland occupied moscow and had polish car . 
  i can see only at wp.pl article about it with title `` acta is coming back in silence '' i 'm not sure if i 've translated it correctly . 
  70 zlotys = less than $ 20 you get unlimited net connection , calls and text messages in poland + 1gb in eu, 
  if it is about pln than you can look at this stats as a number of querter-millionaries 1pln ~ 1euro, 
  [ that carpet !, 
  ] ( http://calvertjournal.com/images/uploads/features/2016_feb/coming_of_age/transnistria/25_juliaautz_transnistrien.jpg ) my grandma had the same one !, 
  or it 's still somewhere in house . 
  naming any street after someone is like giving him a glorious rememberance . 
  maybe spanish think that he does not deserve to live forever in their daily life . 
  what will you do in 20 years ? 
  blaming a country that there is even less workers than 20 years ago and it still wants to support baby bum ? 
  is it sarcasm or you are thinking like a political who thinks about his next election , not about next generations . 
  a lot of wars https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland before i would say that germany or russia , now i 'm not as sure . 
  i got my mobile 10gb lte for 2.5 $ pre-paid . 
  i 'm not using wi-fi anymore . 
  it 's like in gda\u0144sk in every 6th of december . 
  there are motorcyclists driving from gda\u0144sk to gdynia through sopot , those 3 cities are creating tricity . 
  today for me comes star-man and it 's quite common , 6th of december is a day of santa claus  i 'm from gda\u0144sk . 
  i do n't know about others but people i know and i are thinking about star-man as about a santa claus , just another name . 
  because 24th of december is called here also as gwiazdka ( little star ) , as tradition says we should wait to a first star on a sky to start our meal .
