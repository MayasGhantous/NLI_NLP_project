  just in case . 
  especially radioactive fallout in half of europe . 
  why not eastern european writer , warsaw pact , or the communist bloc ? 
  poland was not part of the ussr . 
  lem started writing sci-fi immediately after the war , so it 's hard to say that he was inspired by the soviet writers . 
   during the cold war america was planning to hit moscow with 400 nuclear weapons . 
  they had no other choice . 
  during the cold war the russians had the [ a-35 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a-35_anti-ballistic_missile_system ) ( now [ a-135 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a-135_anti-ballistic_missile_system ) ) deployed around moscow . 
  literally nuclear anti-ballistic system . 
  they planned ( and they still do ) to shoot down nuclear missiles using smaller nuclear missiles . 
   good ** soviet ** sci-fi you can move on the strugatzkis and ** lem ** !, 
  man , this is even worse than the `` polish death camps '' . 
   russia the christ of nations i 'm sorry but this job is already taken . 
  quietly . 
  do not tell them !, 
  from what i heard we have quite a lot , but exploitation is unprofitable . 
  besides we have oldest oil well . 
  relax , we do not have oil . 
   poland is just mini-russia  poland is a watered down version of russia . 
  you have no idea how insulting this is . 
  it sound like some panslavism shit . 
  but not in 40 's . 
  at the end of the war americans produce more tanks per month than russians . 
  besides , russian soldier walked in american shoes , wore an american made uniform , eating american canned food , and drove an american truck . 
   pis as well is trying to restrict women 's rights by making abortion almost impossible in poland , no . 
  it was not their initiative . 
   is very against lgbt rights as if some party in poland supported them . 
  if they are so against as you claim , why they did n't do anything against lgbt ? 
   against immigrants again . 
  as every major party in poland . 
   against balance of power yes , but they are far from what is happening in russia . 
  rather they slide on the edge of the law , sometimes leaning beyond . 
   freedom of press they did n't limit the freedom of the press . 
  they took over the control over state media , it 's quite a big difference . 
  wait , what ? 
  what it has to do with poland ? 
  guys , we need clear white sky above a bloody battlefield , optionally field of poppies . 
  some monk just made a mistake when copying calendar . 
   you 're really going to tell me you would n't avoid certain neighbourhoods if the police did n't tell you what ethnicity is involved in relatively more low level crime then the other ? 
  why do you keep hold of this `` ethnicity '' . 
  in the first comment i wrote `` social group '' . 
  if the police does not provide such information , how do i find out about this . 
  stereotypes ? 
  because people say that there is a dangerously ? 
  certainly better source of information . 
   and you really think that singling out an ethnicity because of what are environmental factors ( unless you think some are more genetically prone to crime , which would end this conversation right now ) makes anyone safer i think so ( except brackets ) , hiding them certainly not . 
   , and not just fuels the type of bigotry that has left more people dead over the last few centuries then anything else ? 
  hiding such information fuels bigotry even more . 
  people know that gypsies steal , but the police hides data about that . 
  this is how conspiracy theories start . 
   you 're honestly telling me you ca n't actually tell when someone looks dangerous or not ? 
  there are cases where it is obvious , there are cases where it is not . 
  rapist/pickpocket would not be very effective if one could recognize him from afar . 
  additional information can help . 
  hiding them not necessary . 
   exactly my point !, 
  what does this link add to the discussion ? 
  you think that if nationality of criminals would be hidden , the problem with mafia would be solved ? 
  in italy , where everybody are italians , mafia is doing well . 
  and thanks to this we can now criticize the bad west for colonialism :p . 
  the problem is that this thinking moves on the european level, 
   ah yes , the best way to stop crime who 's talking about stopping crime ? 
  this is the role of police . 
  the point is to give people a chance to avoid danger , because police cann ' t be everywhere . 
   , by ostracising a whole group of people and making sure they never manage to integrate into society . 
  of course , better to hide the uncomfortable truth , to the detriment of society , for the sake of integration . 
   that 's how they stopped the mafia , right , by everyone avoiding italians . 
  certainly they did not hide their nationality . 
  equal before the law . 
  but if some social group commits more crimes , i prefer to know , and keep away from them , just in case . 
   but soon china will have the biggest economy and military in the world , and they will have better or equally good technology too . 
  their economy already slowing down , and they are still far from eu . 
  they may try , soviets also tried , without a free market , they have no chance in the long run . 
   btw us is virtually a european country so what ? 
  what this changes from the perspective of european . 
  chinese stamps on fizzy drinks instead of coca cola brand ? 
  the only noticeable difference will be that instead of consume american culture , we will start to consume chinese culture . 
  or we will just focus on our culture . 
   africa africa has no chance of catching up with us in this century , the more that the current population growth and climate change provide them famine . 
  china , india , south america , but no africa . 
  united states dominated the world militarily and economically 70 years ago . 
  japan caught up with europe about a hundred years ago . 
  korea did it in the 80s . 
  this is nothing new , and did not affect negatively the lives of people in western europe . 
  as the eu , we are still the strongest economy and technologically surpass all except the us and japan . 
  population does n't matter , otherwise china should rule the world for hundreds of years already . 
  we are still and a long time will be in a position from which we can easily regain influence and military power . 
  but that costs money and political will . 
  the question is not whether we can , but why ? 
  as european you still have a relatively high standard of living , and you exploit third world countries by buying cheap clothes , electronics etc. 
  the difference is that we do n't need to send troops there . 
  at least no one has to die serving somewhere in africa . 
  why ? 
  we did not have colonies . 
  their vision of the eu is different from the west , but i would n't call them eurosceptics . 
  they are not afraid that this may reduce the number of listeners ? 
  especially the younger ones ? 
  i probably would n't buy a new radio for home or car , instead i 'd start to listen more music from smartphone . 
  i do n't know who called the idea of the distribution of refugees `` refugee quota '' , and who later added `` forced '' , but the name stuck . 
  and there was no agreement on this point .
