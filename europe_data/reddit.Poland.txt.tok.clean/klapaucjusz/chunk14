  strange . 
  poland is a very catholic , and women can do things like these since 1921 . 
  i do not know what you mean . 
  in poland there is no hatred to the british who live here . 
  no one here has a problems with the europeans , americans or canadians , although there is no many of them here . 
  we like our homogeneous population , but by joining the eu and the schengen area , we agreed to uncontrolled immigration from eu countries , and so far , after 12 years , you do n't hear complaints . 
  then they are french citizens ( if their parents got citizenship ) . 
  but there are boobs ( as if someone wanted to watch with children ), 
   and a moon colony would depend on supplies from earth forever . 
  that 's the difference . 
  of course it will take a while to get a mars colony off the ground , but once that happened , it can not only sustain itself , it will be able to colonize the whole planet on its own . 
  you ca n't do that on the moon . 
  without terraforming ( which is impossible in the near future ) , both mars and the moon will rely on food production in a some kind of greenhouse , and occasional supplies from earth . 
  as for the lack of raw materials , the moon may base its economy on the exploitation of the asteroid . 
  with low gravity , sending automated ships and bringing the excavated material will be much easier than doing it from earth or mars . 
  but it is so distant future as self-sufficient mars . 
   no we do n't need a `` spaceport '' , an ascent vehicle that can get you into low mars orbit can be brought from earth . 
  the trick is to not bring the fuel and instead create it out of the martian atmosphere . 
  ok i do not know why but i thought that gravity is approximately 0.6 of earth 's gravity . 
  it is 0.38 . 
  so we do not need such big rockets as i thought . 
  i agree that mars is better in the long run . 
  but the colonization of the moon can bring benefits to our grandchildren and not the indefinite future generations . 
  even if we assume a colony on mars , the colony will depend on the supply from earth for decades . 
  just like a colony on the moon . 
  except that the transport of supplies to the moon will be cheaper and cheapest supply route to mars will run through the moon . 
  anyway , for now the road to mars is one-way street . 
  we need to build a spaceport on mars to be able to come back . 
  its construction and maintenance will not be so easy without the earth 's infrastructure . 
  the low gravity of the moon helps . 
  let americans to pump money into the colonization of mars that will not pay for itself for decades , during that time we will build the foundation for the trade route . 
  and then let them pay a toll . 
  peanut butter is not very popular in poland . 
  but i checked and found out that i was wrong . 
  use of the name `` butter '' is regulated by the european union : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32007r0445 but there are exceptions :  the rule does not apply in particular to designations where the exact nature of the product is clear from traditional usage and/or where the designation is clearly used to describe a characteristic quality of the product . 
  and the name `` peanut butter '' is one of the them : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:31988d0566&amp;from=en, 
  i do n't see a problem . 
  in poland , for example , products from vegetable oils ca n't use the name `` butter '' . 
  what 's the point ? 
  i have an account on facebook . 
  i 've have one photo and not logged on there for half a year . 
  this is ok , or maybe i am now even more suspicious , because i do n't publish any information about my personal life ? 
  the problem is that nobody controls the internal borders . 
  a refugee can easily go to another country . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm not expert . 
  but the old rural buildings look different in different parts of the poland , so i assume that in the west it also need to be different . 
   i was talking about high arts and architecture , which is also an important part of a cultural identity . 
  yes , but i was writing about the video game . 
  our high art is heavily dominated by partitions of poland , and attempts to regain independence ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanticism_in_poland ) . 
  in contrast , for example , to russian literature , which is more universal , and it is understandable for the average european ( war and peace , crime and punishment ) . 
  even our painting focuses on these topics , as matejko , or kossak . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/jan_matejko%2c_sta%c5%84czyk.jpg http://herbowi.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kossak-husaria-pod-kircholmem.jpg i do not deny that the polish culture and art was connected to the rest of europe , but also was significantly different , and probably the same can be said about the culture of other nations . 
  the second picture i gave is irl . 
  you say that the villagers , often illiterate , who painted murals on the walls of their homes , for centuries , were cosmopolitan ? 
  cities in the former poland were very to those in other parts of europe , but the villages have ave preserved their character to the end of the xix century .

   like what ? 
  the character ( s ) do not look very polish to me . 
  classic polish rural architecture , classic polish paintings on the walls of houses . 
  in one of the tasks it is shown dziady ritual , referring to polish folklore , and polish classical literature . 
  not to mention the countless references to polish books , movies , or folk songs that are likely to have changed in the translation . 
   because i do not view my own food as superior who 's talking about the superiority of food ? 
  it 's a little extreme do n't you think ? 
  i eat polish food , because it is good , and it is cheap because most components is produced here . 
   what i like most are video games , since none of them associate with a particular nationality or culture . 
  are you kidding ? 
  then why in the majority of games we play as the americans ? 
  games do not arise in a vacuum . 
  the witcher 3 is a very very polish game . 
  you have no idea how many things in the witcher 3 is incomprehensible outside poland ( except perhaps some slavic countries ) . 
  many things were lost even in translation . 
   yes but i kind of find local memes a bit annoying . 
  it does n't matter . 
  they exist , and it matters . 
  yes , today we have a lot in common . 
  but this common part is mainly the american/english ( and already localized christian and roman ) part . 
  we dress like americans , watch american movies , listen to american music , eat american food , and communicate in english . 
  but most of our culture is completely different . 
  i watch polish films , read polish books , eat polish food , and i communicate in polish . 
  and i bet that you 're doing swedish things . 
  our cultural code is different . 
  our history is different . 
  we even have local memes !, 
  something that came into existence in the internet era , mainly exist in the internet , and should therefore be global , but it is not . 
  yes , and they 're going to kill all infidels / s. 
  i would say that their knowledge on these topics is even worse . 
  creationism is popular among people with low education , this is a very simple concept ( god created everything as it looks today . 
  the end , you are the expert now ) . 
  people who do n't have a clue about economics , politics or history can be found at universities , without much of a problem . 
  of course , you ca n't be a specialist in everything . 
  i do n't have a clue about the economy , but at least i know that . 
  there are many people i know who think they know something about the history , but they do not . 
  i would n't care too much . 
  i think that after 50 years of communism , our society still has much bigger problems than creationism . 
  it does n't have a major impact on everyday life . 
  many people , unfortunately , despite the fact that vatican accepted evolutions in the 90s . 
  many people who do n't believe in evolution has a an image of john paul ii at home , and they do n't even know that he accepted it :p . 
  even the construction of camp in the desert would be cheaper than feeding and accommodation all of them in the center of europe . 
  yes .
