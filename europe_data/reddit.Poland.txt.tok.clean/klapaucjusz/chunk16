  in place of hungary , i would like to have them in the eu . 
  yugoslavia is something else , wounds are still fresh . 
  our homogeneity is fine , thanks . 
  at least for now . 
  there is no country in eastern europe who seriously considering exit from the eu . 
  even the right-wing pis is pro-eu , although their vision of the union is a little different . 
  please , do n't even start that . 
  do you want to hear how west betrayed us in yalta ? 
  these people fought for them throughout the entire war , and the british did n't even thanked so as not offend the new communist friends . 
  intentions of the government are obvious , which does n't mean that the current situation with ngos is ok and nothing should be changed . 
  i do n't know if i 'm happy with this , i have n't seen the end result yet . 
  this is poland , nothing here is just black and white , everything is gray . 
  ngos are not innocent . 
  we can try , but it does not imply that we will succeed . 
  and if not , well , our people are more important . 
  when someone asks for help , it is ok . 
  when someone breaks into your house and demands help , it is not ok . 
  in the second option , at some point i would start to shoot , at least if i had a gun . 
  do n't forget about tsunami . 
  emergency diesel generators in the basement are very sensitive to flooding . 
  who would have thought . 
  of course , zaporozhian cossacks , best cossacks :p . 
  what does this have to do with what i wrote ? 
  except copy and paste you could just cite the source . 
  you are the largest exporter of food in the world , but what do i care if you do n't export that much to the european union . 
  technically , they were also our , before the khmelnytsky . 
  you overestimate . 
  us imports more food from europe than vice versa .

  kiev is not the whole ukraine . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/kievan-rus-1015-1113-%28en%29.png ) however , i see that the majority of sources indicating `` borderline '' has more or less one hundred years , newer sources are not as consistent . 
   food are you kidding ? 
  i somehow agree with the rest ( although it works both ways , but we are a group of small countries and it is not so obvious ) , but food ? 
  you gave us a fast food and starbucks coffee . 
   ukraine 's etymology though : / it was borderland for us . 
  and for kievan rus before , only from the other side, 
  i just nod , with the exception of close friends and old people, 
  because you did n't have this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squat_toilet . 
  like most poles . 
   overly cautious you cann ' t be overly cautious when it comes to food . 
  are you sure it 's unlimited internet , not `` unlimited . '', 
  a year ago i paid 45 pln for unlimited internet ( 100 gb ) on prepaid , without text messages and calls . 
  now it costs 49pln http://www.play.pl/uslugi/pik-miesiac-bez-limitu-gb/ now , i checked and if you buy [ `` formu\u0142a solo l '' ] ( http://www.play.pl/oferta/przejdz-do-play/play-abonament/#solo ) in the [ contract ] ( https://www.play.pl/resources/pdf/2016/regulamin-oferty-promocyjnej-formula-solo_01082016.pdf ) is written that the internet slows down after 10gb . 
  i do not know exactly , because i changed provider a few months ago . 
  at least in prepaid . 
  i checked again , and if you read the contract you get `` unlimited '' internet 10gb . 
  in the same provider . 
  i see that this is terribly confusing . 
  i recalled why i stuck with prepaid . 
  true , but in poland you can still have 100gb with lte speed and then slower for 12-16 euros . 
  in poland , it 's rather 50-100 gb at maximum speed and then reduce to 64 kb/s -1 mb/s , it depends on the operator . 
  in play it 's 100gb for 12 euros , or 16 euros with device , per month . 
   it promptly imploded due to internal quarrels true internet . 
  not only germany , unfortunately . 
  wait , lesbos was before `` lesbians '' , and this means that lesbian means `` steed '' , or `` girl from steed '' ? 
  unfortunately , eagles are under protection today , and we do n't have enough feathers . 
  but we can send them [ this ] ( http://robertlaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/leopard-mg-5474.jpg ) if you really want . 
  but that 's slightly overkill in my opinion . 
  if the company survives that long . 
   how to push germany to not give free money for all of that people ? 
  let 's be realistic , and just send soldiers, 
  porn and masturbation have already been invented long ago , what could be worse ? 
  i do n't know danish someone explain ? 
   if we could have turned russia into germany russia was in a worse condition than the most of eastern europe which is now part of the eu , and those countries are still far from germany . 
  they have so much to pay off that they probably will not even notice . 
   i feel certain that in 100 years western europe will be fractured and at war with the muslims here . 
  at the moment , at most , a typical european ethnic cleansing . 
  the scene on the boat at the beginning is from rome 2 : total war . 
  and all the scenes where the soldiers are marching . 
  i do n't know even if it was 30 minutes , the standard porn scene lasts about 20-30 minutes . 
  besides , 10 years old man has a different sense of time . 
  it gets more interesting when you realize that all these parties are pro-eu . 
  oh please . 
  i had contact ( accidental ) with porno movies at the age of 10 . 
  it was boring . 
  30 minute sex scene , no dialogue , no action , no plot twists , just two naked people . 
  nothing terrible has happened , my poor young brain did n't explode . 
  it was not until several years later that i realized what was going on in these films . 
   but the system will be proportional . 
  as you say  you inventing systems does n't make it real . 
  without a real possibility to influence policy i doubt that countries ( especially small ones ) would willingly joined to the federation . 
  of course , this can be solved in another way , such as the right to veto . 
  but you know that if the eu integration will go further in the future , the elections in europe will work similarly , and let say , the baltic countries will be able to outvote germany . 
  not for people who recognize the unborn child as a human being . 
  but in their eyes , yes , you 're probably right . 
  next time i 'll be more specific . 
  it is not just shortened version/synonym of `` i 'm against abortion on demand '' ? 
  technically , atheism is a lack of faith in god , there are no other rights and requirements , or holy book that tells what to do . 
  communist atheism is still atheism . 
  anti-theistic , slightly retarded atheism , but still . 
  and i say this as a pro-life atheist . 
  hitler turning in his grave :p, 
  this joke is so old :p, 
  more like `` you are very sick , you have to take a week off '', 
   so what is the alternative ? 
  minefields and barbed wire !, 
  they do n't spoil the view as much as big fences . ^ / s, 
  nothing new . 
  just typical ad hominem .
