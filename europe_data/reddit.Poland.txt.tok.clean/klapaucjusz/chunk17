  `` you are a racist , xenophobe , homophobe and islamophobe '' is just a new version of good old `` you are literally hitler ! '', 
  it was not their proposal . 
   so marriage is a human right only if a man and a woman want to get married ? 
  it depends on the interpretation . 
  from my point of view , yes . 
  but if this article would sound like this :  article 16 . 
    ( 1 ) ** people ** of full age , without any limitation due to race , nationality , ** sex ** or religion , have the right to marry and to found a family . 
  they are entitled to equal rights as to marriage , during marriage and at its dissolution . 
  then you are right . 
  but it is not . 
   its so funny , like you have one of the biggest diasporas in europe yet are anti immigration to the bone . 
  total cognitive dissonance . 
  you know that poles in poland and poles on emigration are two different groups ? 
  the map is weird . 
  poland and lithuania are separate countries in the 1500s despite having one king , so this is not a rule . 
  then we have this poland-lithuania-saxony thing in 1700s . 
  you ca n't dismiss the judge . 
  the judges do n't even retire . 
  pis will transfer the judges to rest . 
  maybe , later , they will put them in court , the sentenced judge stops being a judge . 
  art 187.3 is not inconsistent with article 180.5 . 
  judges remain judges for the rest of their lives , but they may be at rest or be moved to a different position . 
  your interpretation causes point 5 to contradict point 1 . 
  lack of ambition . 
  no expectations from parents . 
  in practice , if your parents are poor , you will almost certainly be poor . 
  unless you do n't get to the toilet on time, 
  i understand that toilet next to the bedroom was n't a good idea in the middle ages , but this is a slight exaggeration . 
  that 's true , but first and foremost because , like all medicines , it can also hurt instead of healing . 
  therefore , the doctor , on the basis of his knowledge , the condition of the patient , the symptoms of the disease , congenital diseases , allergies and other factors decide what drugs to take and in what amounts . 
  do you think a teenager would not take a pill if she ( theoretically ) was allergic to one of the ingredients , or would rather risk and take a pill because she does not want a baby ? 
  a little too far into the past . 
  in the west , with exceptions , homosexuality was decriminalized in the middle of the 20th century or later . 
   poland is n't a part of the western world . 
  and when in the west homosexuality was criminalized , but in poland was not , where were we ? 
  you will not get stupid antibiotic without a prescription but the free access to day-after pill is ok ? 
  it is very polish to enjoy the misfortune of the neighbor . 
  we have taught you well . 
   any thread regarding poland or the v4 or refugees is very unwelcoming to pro-eu comments . 
  do you mean comments that claim that we should be forced to accept refugees , we should be punished , we should be deprived of european funds , or that we should leave the union ? 
  if so , you are right , they are unwelcoming . 
   blame your inept politicians we took care of it already . 
  voting for the quotas was the last nail in the coffin of the former government . 
  i learned about it a few years ago and it 's still strange to me . 
  acceptance of homosexuality is small , but many people just do n't care . 
  maybe in the west . 
  in poland we just do n't want the next gypsies , just more explosive one . 
   when did europeans become such titanic cowards ? 
  cowards ? 
  instead of killing them on the border like our ancestors , we just want to stop them . 
  if it 's cowardice , maybe we should go back to the roots ? 
  krak\u00f3w is not an option , but with winged hussar in play again , we can arrange constantinople in replace :p, 
  do n't forget that we are almost nazis now . 
  and i think we should get a piece of vienna for saving the city a few hundred years ago . 
  you can always merge with hungary , they are first in line . 
  okay , your king will become king of the commonwealth , but he must convert to catholicism . 
  and you can keep estonia . 
  just do n't rebell this time . 
   maybe we get sanctioned again by the eu  not so fast . 
  this time you have to wait for your turn :p, 
  relax , this is not the eu . 
  the oecd is an international economic organization and is not directly related to eu structures . 
  a matter of perspective . 
  if you limit yourself to polish politics , for lack of a better alternative , you can call them good guys . 
  but i do n't know if i would like their new constitution . 
  more such news and in the next election pis will win by a constitutional majority . 
  at least it 's not the eu . 
   you 're still drowning , and we let it happen despite being able to help . 
  so , what is your view on euthanasia ? 
   not really . 
  but , but , it 's my salary :( . 
  and i think it 's enough for a reasonable life . 
  but i live in a small town so the cost of living is lower . 
  and the only company in the area that offers more is ikea industry , but i 'm lazy for it . 
  only part of it . 
  poland will be opposed to the russian state until the end of the world . 
   btw , this is why this government while borderline retarded in many cases is continuing to be popular and probably will be for a long time . 
  yep . 
  i did n't vote for them , but if all these financial charts will continue to be as good as now , they have my vote . 
  bialowieza forest is not a national park . 
  the bialowieza national park is part of the bialowieza forest . 
  the rest of the forest is hard to call the primary forest , its old , but people planted it . 
  state forests do n't even have jurisdiction over national parks , not to mention the felling of trees . 
   leave national parks they do n't cut trees in the national parks, 
  i wonder how bad it must be in other countries . 
  who will give them citizenship ? 
  the nobility had rights not because they had money but because they were born in a noble family . 
  nobility with money just abused the system , but we also see this today . 
  maybe i 'll explain it otherwise . 
  if you were a wealthy jewish merchant , you did not have the right to vote ( unless you were rich enough , and know right people , to buy a title :p ) . 
  if you were a poor nobleman , you had the right to vote . 
   the movement opposed the abuse of the existing laws by the higher nobility ( magnates ) , and demanded the `` execution '' , or actual implementation , of already existing legislature . 
  [ * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executionist_movement ) so , practically corruption , which does not change what i wrote . 
   the rich and powerful who say they `` represent the country '' will grant themselves the rights to destroy it if they can . 
  except , it was not about money but about birth . 
  a large part of the polish szlachta was poor and lived no better than the peasants , or serving in the army or richer nobility . 
  and they all had the same rights as rich magnates . 
  of course , the magnates often bought their support , but back then it was legal . 
  the fact that we do n't agree with the main political line of the eu does not mean that we are eurosceptics .
