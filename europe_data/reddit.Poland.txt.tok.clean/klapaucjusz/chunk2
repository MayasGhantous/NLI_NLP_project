  poland also pays contributions to the eu budget . 
  of course , we pay less than we get , but in the future we will pay more . 
  britain wants to reduce benefits , it 's in no way reduce immigration from the east . 
  but it is still a problem of western europe . 
  east at most , losing manpower . 
   the immigration crisis in eastern europe what crisis ? 
  there is no crisis in eastern europe . 
  you mean western europe . 
  we do n't want to take immigrants , we propose to close the external eu border . 
  but no , you still allow come thousands of uneducated , uncivilized people , who are unable to live in europe . 
  you know . 
  you were a little larger in those times :p . when it comes to vilnius . 
  it was like kosovo today . 
  historically , the city was lithuanian , but in the city and the surrounding area lived mainly poles . 
  we had a similar problem with lviv . 
  unfortunately , we solved this problem by force . 
  you know it 's dead law . 
  nobody in poland say that . 
  translating directly into polish means something like `` death camps owned ( or build ) by poles '' . 
  `` death camps in poland '' is more correct and does n't change the meaning when translated . 
  for saying that you do n't go to jail :p . 
  nobody uses the word `` gwa\u0142t '' in the original sense . 
  even in dictionaries its first definition is `` forcing someone into sexual intercourse '' . 
  unfortunately not . 
  auschwitz camp was just one of many . 
   the nazi occupation of poland was among the most brutal of the war , resulting in more than three million gentile deaths and the deaths of about three million polish jews . 
  the six million jewish , roman catholic and orthodox poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country 's population . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocaust_victims#poles of course , not all victims were killed in the death camps . 
  total holocaust deaths by nation/religion . 
  i would n't admit to this in a polish prison :p . 
  what does this have to do with the topic ? 
  you mean cieszyn silesia ? 
  you know it 's not us we started ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war  the czechoslovak government in prague requested that the poles cease their preparations for elections to the polish sejm in the area that had been designated polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas . 
  the polish government declined and czechoslovak units attacked the polish part of cieszyn silesia to prevent the elections in the contested territory . 
  [ 1 ] the attack was halted under pressure from the entente . 
  the result of the war was the new demarcation line , which expanded the territory controlled by czechoslovakia . 
  it led to the division of the region of cieszyn silesia in july 1920 , and left a substantial polish minority in czechoslovakia in the region later called zaolzie . 
  the division of cieszyn silesia did not satisfy poland and led to the polish annexation of zaolzie in 1938 . 
  poles fought against the germans from the first day of the war to the end . 
  on all fronts and in occupied poland . 
  how could we kill more jews ? 
  we wage with them a regular war for 5 years ? 
  of course we had few . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland  `` polish collaborators '' at around several thousand in a population of about 35 million ( that number is supported by the israeli war crimes commission ) but if you compare this to the netherlands  thousands of dutch volunteers joined the 11th ss volunteer panzergrenadier division nordland or belgium https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_belgium_during_world_war_ii#collaboration  after the war , 53,000 belgian citizens ( 0.6 percent of the population ) were found guilty of collaboration , providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period . 
  around 15,000 belgians served in two separate divisions of the waffen-ss ,, 
  what real polish responsibility ? 
  you mean those few thousand collaborators ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland  depending on a definition of collaboration ( and of a polish citizen , based on ethnicity and minority status ) , scholars estimate number of `` polish collaborators '' at around several thousand in a population of about 35 million ( that number is supported by the israeli war crimes commission ) . the estimate is based primarily on the number of death sentences for treason by the special courts of the polish underground state . 
  yeah . 
  or use a very long stick and push boat through the turkish border :p . speaking seriously , i think it wo n't work . 
  and then f-117 was [ shot down ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_f-117a_shootdown ) by using outdated s-125 . 
  of course , only one , but russia is not a third world country with outdated weapons , and untrained staff . 
  right , but remember that there are roughly 16 s-400 in kaliningrad , and it is unknown how many s-300 ( russians have almost 1,000 ( data from 2010 ) ) . 
  your planes your risk . 
  yes . 
  russians say it can , but it depends on the installed radar . 
  [ this is the range of s-400 placed in kaliningrad . 
  ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--aehilnud--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/tody8gdza4fvdy06e2o6.jpg ), 
   no , it 's special treatment . 
  do it for people of random gender , then it 's polite . 
  you can open the door for a man , but only if he carries refrigerator ( or similar ) . 
  so i can pronounce this ( at least the first part  in polish ch = h ( eg chowa\u0107 ) . 
  some hundred years ago there were some differences in pronunciation , but i do not even know what . 
  is google translate synthesizer pronounce it correctly ? 
  if so , ch = h in polish  . 
  relax , you did n't tell anything about refugees ( this western correctness  . 
  speaking of the refugees i wanted to show the difference between east and west europe . 
  the difference in the approach to refugees lies in the approach to nationalism . 
   polish nationalism    european nationalism you 're right , but one does not exclude the other . 
  a few days ago i saw this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jgrvq_15iy ) . 
  of course , it is rather something like `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' , but i think that the european nationalism is possible . 
  not today , and rather alongside national nationalism ( ? 
  ) , but possible . 
  so we do n't have a problem with brexit , english stays in europe : p. 
  oh , i forgot about it , we were not involved . 
  btw , what happened in 1648 ? 
  firstly , we wo n't send any tanks because we ca n't declare wars . 
  you can sleep well :p . secondly . 
  it depends on the definition . 
  i 'm a patriot , but in most agree with nationalists ( except some `` poles are better '' things , but that 's a minority ) . 
  if you read about the [ polish nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_nationalism ) , you 'll see that most of this is not something negative , at least from my point of view . 
  example of the recent problems with refugees . 
  eastern europe does n't want to accept refugees because they can be dangerous for our people , and our people are more important for us . 
  this does n't mean that we do n't want to help , we want to , but in a safe way for us . 
  i did not see similar thinking in the west , at least on the beginning . 
  without the uk we can treat english like esperanto . 
  it would be even more fair , no nation would be favored . 
  partly , yes . 
  but it 's easier to read `` sz '' , `` cz '' , '' \u017a '' , '' \u017c '' , `` d\u017a '' , `` d\u017c '' , or `` dz '' , than to pronounce . 
  i would not say that 's impossible . 
  you can always learn only to read and write . 
   personally , i 'd also love it if language learning was promoted more . 
  like encourage people to learn at least one slavic and one romance language . 
   learning is always a good thing , but to teach everyone one language ( as the second ) , like english now , it is easier , cheaper and more practical . 
  besides , slavic languages are not that easy to learn . 
   in europe its the mentality `` nationalism is right wing stuff and we are all citizens of the world , the latter is true we are citizens of the world . 
   in western europe , on the east ( at least in poland ) nationalism is still strong , although we stop calling it nationalism . 
  because in europe only hundred years ago they lived only white people , and women did not even had voting rights . 
  even when women have been allowed to study , about a hundred years ago , they were still only white people , because only they lived here .
