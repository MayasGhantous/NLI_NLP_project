  i read these comments and see that west europe totally does n't understand east ( and vice versa ) . 
  no , but it facilitates creation of varieties . 
  just throw dash and not change the whole character . 
  in a similar manner , this also works here : `` rz '' and \u017c sound the same , but mie ** rz ** y\u0107 - mia ** r ** a bie ** \u017c ** nia - bie ** g ** a\u0107 ( '' \u017c '' is also change to `` z , \u017a , s '' , but never `` r '' ) also `` ch '' change to `` sz '' , and `` h '' to `` g , \u017c , z , dz '' tro ** ch ** \u0119 - tro ** sz ** k\u0119 dru ** h ** - dru ** \u017c ** yna we had to change half of grammar to combine these characters , or learn everything by heart . 
  unfortunately . 
  current polish-russian relations are too bad to consider purchase of military equipment . 
  we replace post-soviet military equipment from years . 
  mostly by western production equipment . 
  no one considering buying from the russia now . 
  rather `` fshud '' , but what to do with all this variations without the '' \u00f3 '' ? 
  it does n't make sense . 
  i do n't know if there 's anything to recover . 
  youngest machines are 33 years old and the oldest 45 . 
  you can replace the engine , but not the hull . 
  anyway , i do n't know if anyone took this into account . 
  that 's stupid . 
  we need to replace old the mi-8 , and only airbus offered something suitable . 
  i think most men ( non-muslim ) would n't mind . 
  but `` what if your son married a man ? '', 
  will be interesting . 
  from smoke signals specialist to space laser engineers . 
  `` poland is the new russia '' ? 
  this is even worse than `` polish death camp '' . 
  i feel very offended . 
  if pis is ultra-conservative , how to call more conservative parties , like korwin , rn or knp ? 
  from the polish point of view . 
  the weakening of patriotism ? 
  dividing the country into regions ? 
  to me it sounds like the partitions of poland , or germanization . 
  i doubt the poles would support something like that . 
  the vast majority of us still believe in the idea of the nation state . 
  recent problems with immigrants show clear differences between east and west . 
  in this case federalisation makes no sense . 
  i go on holiday mainly for `` ancient stuff '' :d . i 'm not a `` lying all day on the beach '' person . 
  so rhodes is ok ? 
  i was planning to visit athens , but probably wait for the end of this crisis . 
  and that 's why s&p lowered our rating :p, 
  not between . 
  we need replace our mi-8 , something smaller is not enough . 
  is there any map which shows where in greece are immigrants , and where is save ? 
  yep , we have experience in [ liberum veto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ), 
  why do you think we are applying for nato base in poland ? 
  we are not going to wait for consensus . 
  it 's not dubbing . 
  it 's voice-over translation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voice-over_translation, 
  maybe in the center of warsaw . 
  my parents pay 10 euros for cable tv , so netfix is not that expensive , but still for 10 euros i have three dinners for four people . 
  as i said , a little homophobic . 
  we do n't punish them , like some western countries in the past , but try to be gay in a small village ... 
  it 's not so bad to call it fascism . 
  this guy was just a little too sarcastic , so misunderstood . 
  in short , he wanted to say that the leftist vision of progress may not be the only possibility and the best . 
  the new government must just learn the language of diplomacy . 
  still fascism is too strong word . 
  just conservatism . 
  i recall that even previous `` progressive '' government was unable to legalize gay marriage , despite the majority in parliament . 
  some members of the former ruling party , was against it . 
  nothing new . 
  we have always been little racist and homophobic , but now we chose government who dont hide with this . 
  it 's hard to call this incident terrorist attack . 
  he was n't designed to intimidate anyone . 
  besides , in the west terrorist attacks are n't only the domain of muslims . 
  there are also european terrorist groups ( eg . 
  interesting . 
  it seems that in western europe is now very quiet . 
  living in poland i have n't comparison , we did n't have terrorist attacks since the last war . 
  then who trained isis ? 
   even when that requires a little effort . 
  as `` little effort '' , you mean `` fatalities '' ? 
  we do n't talk about what governments are doing in reality , but what they should do . 
  no one normally does want to die in war for some resources , no one will choose government who wants declare war , it does n't work in democracy ( exept usa ) . 
  in poland we ca n't even declare a war first , it 's unconstitutional . 
  besides this becomes little off topic . 
   what do you think will happen when governments only give a shit about themselves , their own interests , ambitions and goals ? 
  not their own interest , the citizens interest . 
  war , except defensive , is never good for citizens . 
  sending aid do n't harm people , but if we ca n't identify who is a refugee and who is a terrorist it may harm them later . 
  all people are equal , but i pay taxes in poland and choose government . 
  their responsibility is protect my and other citizens in first place . 
  i think it would be like anti-russian orban hungary, 
  independence day was constituted in 1937 . 
  under communism ( 1945-89 ) independence day was banned . 
  instead we had then a `` national day of polish rebirth '' on 22 july . 
  only officially . 
  there is evidence that some polish knights at grunwald still worshiped sun next to god . 
  poland was then a catholic from 4 centuries , and lithuania only couple years . 
  nothing special , just an `` unfortunate coincidence '' . 
  the russians came , the germans came , and then the russians again . 
  at least it looks like a proper palpatine palace . 
  i prefer the interwar project . 
  after ww2 we became a puppet of the soviet union , it 's hard to call it independence . 
  practically impossible to implement in poland . 
  the standard ebook `` drm '' in poland is a watermark . 
  user has full control over the file . 
  attempts to introduce a more restrictive form of drm were unsuccessful . 
  in the the navy it would n't be a big problem . 
  only communication between the ships would have to be in english . 
  crews could be nationally homogeneous . 
  in aviation english is already required probably everywhere , so this is not a problem . 
  language is a problem only for the army .
