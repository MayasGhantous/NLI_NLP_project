  maybe they do n't eat enough potatoes and onions . 
  the problem is that polish army needs to replace mi-8 . 
  s-70i ( not uh-60 ) is too small . 
  all proposed helicopters are too small , although the caracal is the biggest . 
  the best solution would be to buy mi-17 ( not because politics ) , or nh90 ( not because the price ), 
  and what does this have to do with poland , and its immigration policy . 
  it is your country and your problem . 
  first you have to figure out how to make a good flour . 
   european fanta you mean , nazi fanta :p . 
  i would even say that their water surrounded your ship . 
  i did n't say that . 
  after all there was no nationalities back then . 
  we were plc back then and we should be treated as one country . 
  unfortunately , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth is difficult to remember for westerners . 
  let 's be honest , our ancestors were not very good at creating a good brand, 
  you 're right . 
  the first hungarian goulash was probably made from ottoman soldiers . 
  condom is not the only contraceptive , there are pills before , pills after etc. 
  and when it comes to unsafe sex . 
  if they are stupid and have sex without protection they must take responsibility . 
  i see it differently . 
  we were hospitable , and they fled to germany . 
  now we hate them . 
  and we can always say `` we tried '' . 
  it depends on your point of view . 
  from the polish pov , the cdu is at least a center-left . 
  ok . maybe it was too extreme . 
  you support a stronger centralization and integration of the eu , or rather a vision of a decentralized eu ? 
  i ask because no one can be objective , so i prefer to take correction based on political views . 
  you are both pro-eu , anti-eu , or you have two different opinions ? 
  ( i would prefer the latter ), 
  i always perceived the british royal family as a kind of national mascot . 
  but in poland the nobles chose the rulers since the xvi century ( and gave permission for the coronation even since xiv ) , and this may be the reason why i do n't get it . 
  people want a strong union , as long as it works according to their wishes . 
  and suddenly everyone is surprised that some country wants to leave the union . 
  that is the wrong question . 
  it creates an artificial sense of support for the current policy of the eu . 
  the question should be how the eu should intervene . 
  everybody want more intervention in the case of immigration . 
  problem is that a part of them wants to distribute immigrants among the eu countries , and the other part does n't want to let them in . 
   bloody vasas ' ? 
  they look that bad from the lithuanian perspective ? 
  ok , one parent is a pole , so that counts . 
  before we had almost the same . 
  the main difference is that the previous government has advertised itself as a modern and present as a conservative . 
  the majority voted for the current government because they did n't like the previous one . 
  the same thing happens slowly in the west . 
  better ? 
  the current system is so good that people are slowly cease to trust authority and the system . 
  how long such a system will continue ? 
   have rules against hate speech praising the attack on freedom of speech  law explicitly saying that , if there is no other way , the people are allowed to use all means necessary to stop the abolishment of this established system . 
  as i said , the dictatorship of the elite : p . we do not have such a law in poland ( as i think and hope ) . 
  too much space for abuse , the system can be changed for better or for worse . 
  yes , but we do n't have any better . 
  ok , maybe we have , but they are not possible to implement . 
  nah , you just need to build a flying car ( or something ) , to appease the people . 
  seriously . 
  i like the idea of technocracy , but unfortunately mankind is not that perfect . 
  communism is an example . 
   again , you 're defining a democracy in a very narrow sense . 
  yes . 
  if people do not have a voice , it is not a democracy for me . 
   the fact that modern democracies try to protect themselves against fascist takeovers democracy cann ' t defend themselves against fascism . 
  large enough majority can change the constitution ( at least in poland ) , and we can have fascism ( or not ) . 
  and there is nothing you can do about it ( except for preventive dictatorship ), 
  and then it is no longer a democracy . 
  people do n't like that . 
   what the ** people want ** is not what we should necessarily do . 
  it is not such a big problem . 
  the problem is that the present governments are starting to do things that ** people do not want ** . 
  you saw two black men . 
  the question is whether you saw two black poles ? 
  rather that nobody wants to fuck us . 
  nobody said that democracy is perfect . 
  the people have the power and they can give this authority to someone else . 
  the fascist governments in italy and germany are the result of the first world war . 
  italy gained not enough reward from joining the war . 
  germany lost the war , even though there was no enemy soldiers in germany . 
  the peace treaty was one of the most humiliating in history . 
  people felt betrayed and without seeing better way supported the extreme . 
  the same thing is happening right now . 
  well , hard science are exception . 
  but the prediction of social change , and determine whether it will be better or worse for us , this is futurology . 
  we have different view on modern democracy . 
  for me , the model is the swiss political system . 
  recent differences between governments and the people show that you ca n't govern against the people . 
  this system does not work and in the long run will lead to fascism or dictatorship of the current elite . 
   democracy is dependent on informed voters . 
  if they are n't , democracy does n't work . 
  it is impossible to say who is right or who is better informed , which is why we have a democracy , not a government based on meritocracy . 
   and i care more about democracy then about the will of the people . 
  democracy - the term originates from the greek \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ( d\u0113mokrat\u00eda ) `` rule of the people '' . 
  `` rule of the people '' \u2260 `` will of the people '' ? 
  sure , because a united europe is so strong that it cann ' t even protect its own borders . 
  western europe has become weak . 
  germany still blame themselves for world war ii . 
  france and the united kingdom blame themselves for colonialism . 
  now they want to be the good guys . 
  even if we remain united , how to compete with china or the united states , when the eu is afraid to act . 
   ignorance is really a problem .
