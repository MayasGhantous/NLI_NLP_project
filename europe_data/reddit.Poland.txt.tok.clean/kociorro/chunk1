well , it is impressive . 
  no doubt . 
  the precious specimen is finally captured !, 
  whoops ... better call mr tuomioja , then ;p, 
   suomi-superpower !, 
  fortunately finland is not located to the east from central europe , nor close to russian border ... also , historically finns were always * safe * in the scope of any russian territorial claims . 
  well , i hope that he will help to overwhelm the current pile of troubles . 
  yay !, 
  is this * reddit official * ? 
  i 'm gon na print this post and have it with me ... just in case . 
  i have a mixed feelings about this . 
  looks like trolling of russia + corporate ad ( bleh ) . 
  personally i find it rather funny but i 'm not sure if russian officials will too . 
  yup , it 's a nice anthem . 
  but [ i like the instrumental version better ] ( http://youtu.be/9i6ku92g4tu ) . 
  i 've heard ` zat russia iz ra ` zer big ... 
  it does !, 
  ^ it 's ^ plastic ^ but ^ shhh . . !, 
  yup , with extra creamy topping !, 
  well , if it 's fairly counted and will be used - i see no problem . 
  i 'd hope for balto - polish relations to improve soon , too . 
  especially with lithuania . 
  that 's true . 
  but it [ does look a bit better ] ( http://static.lovetotravel.pl/galery/th/th1_7505_dsc02320.jpg ) not from the parking side ... 
  hungarian inspiration , 
  warsaw is working hard to keep its second place and plans to attack the pole position soon ... 
  o ____ o, 
  it does n't have any doors - just like the warsaw bus in the op . 
  you 're right that it adds up . 
  but ... 
  i 'm pretty sure brazilian apples will be much more expensive than polish ones . 
  brazil is * a bit * further than poland , and has a rather big water basin blocking the way . 
   unless ... the [ kola borehole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kola_superdeep_borehole ) is complete and somehow it goes straight to brazil ... 
  interesting how downvoted you are here despite the fact that you are right :d it 's just the way it has been with poland for a long time . 
  `` the first to fight !, 
  '' , `` christ of the nations '' ... and then - you 've done your part , can go somewhere else now . 
  so , from apples to mangoes , bananas and maracuyas in one night !, 
  too much power in your hands ... , 
  nothing new , my friend ... nothing new . 
  just like vatican ... :(, 
  yup , most likely ... 
  i 'm aware of that  i think femmycommy wanted to make some kind of joke about all these `` something \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0430 '' wines ... 
  anyway , it 's a good wine . 
  i think i might actually try some , even if it was named \u0421\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0438 ( depending on the actual smell upon opening the bottle ) . 
  it 's not worthless . 
  it surely has some deterrent effect . 
  but should anything * real * happen ... well , shit . 
  like ` zis ? 
  i love how `` polish '' is written with small letter , but `` nazi '' with capital letter . 
  well done  but seriously - if such imbeciles turn violent , they should receive some serious spanking ... 
   we are a hundred years before the blacks actually : we are a hundred years behind the blacks ... ftfy, 
  also , if we 're talking about news , then [ pap ] ( http://www.pap.pl/ ) is quite near to being neutral ... or is it ? 
  is that you , [ voteman ] ( http://youtu.be/sqr5jqxqprc ) ? 
  hehe , yup - [ polish dziwadlo ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=dziwad%c5%82o&amp;tbm=isch ) means something utterly strange or senseless ... 
  oh , i know ... :  but this goes deeper !, 
  as far as a little * szukanie * together can be quite amusing , in polish * oszukac * means to deceit / cheat . 
  does it come from slovak / czech and so it means to screw / fuck someone about something ? 
  i can not find any lingual reason for this word in polish . 
  there are many words that mean something totally different in slovak , czech and polish - [ odchody autobusov for example ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/odchody ) or [ cerstve pecivo ] ( https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/czerstwe%20pieczywo ) . 
  i remember ivan mladek narrating the [ snow white ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kr%c3%b3lewna_%c5%9anie%c5%bcka ) in polish in front of czech audience and everyone was laughing at the top of their lungs ... , 
  that was very informative and it helps a lot . 
  thank you !, 
  i only hope they will stay mutually intelligible , as this thread taught me - it is very important . 
  please , never forget that it makes very little effort to speak the other language , too . 
  ta-ta !, 
  but does it make very little effort to speak the other language , though . . ? 
  this is of utmost importance !, 
  are you absolutely sure about ` zis ? 
  i 'm not implying anything . 
  i 'm imploring you to accept the fact that czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligable . 
  ^ sorry , ^ just ^ a ^ joke ... 
  czech and slovak unusual and good . 
  also mutually intelligable . 
  but i must add that vyprazany syr ftw !, 
  how come ? 
  but ... but did you know that it makes enormous effort to speak ** the otter language ** ? 
  it is not very intelligable . 
  are you sure , though ? 
  did you know that polish and lithuanian are not mutually intelligable ? 
  it makes huge effort to speak the other language ... 
  it did help me fo ' shizzle my nizzle ... 
  orly ? 
  oh , i stay corrected , then . 
  thanks , 
  no problem , 
  well , you have to know these things when you 're a king , you know . 
  using my * slavic power * i assume that ptako-pysk is quite literally birdy-snout . 
  so , it 's also the most precise one , 
  african or european swallow ? 
  i have noted everything . 
  thank you , kind internet stranger ... 
  they will never see me coming !, 
  but what about loud yelling in some foreign language ... preferably german . ? 
  will that add some extra quality to my image ? 
  thanks !, 
  but ... but * \u017c * and * rz * are pronounced the same . 
  they 're just written differently . 
  although in fact all these ch , cz , sz , rz have to be remembered to be read `` together '' so you do have a point here . 
  hm . . but i guess it might be hard to keep being a * clandestine tourist * all the time . 
  if your appearance do n't betray you , it might be your speech .
