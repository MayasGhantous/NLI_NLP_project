  * bicycles . 
  * landscape architecture !, 
  * tiny * skiing * shopping * very nice locals * mountains everywhere - spots for new buildings are being carved out of the rock * some strange system of authority with french president being a andorrian prince , or something like that * used to be very religious, 
  well , that 's your point of view . 
  you might be right to some extent . 
  snowden 's actions probably were helpful for kgb and chinese . 
  but it does n't change my opinion on the behaviour of polish authorities . 
  they are so eager to help ... 
  pity you can only choose between boot-lickers and butt-lickers in the elections . 
  if kgb was really helping him , he would not be trapped in the airport , do n't you think ? 
  shame on polish authorities !, 
  hopefully this bunch of cowards will be washed away during next elections . 
  too bad there is no real alternative for them . 
  anyway , today i am ashamed of my country :(, 
  came here to write that ... upvote for you , then , 
  what about `` hide behind a radiator '' part ? 
  was a bit confused , too . 
  but then i read :  fifa , uefa . 
  paragons of transparency and honesty aaah , it might be sarcastic ... , 
  good enough for me !, 
  what about red hair ? 
  true true thumbs up for the irish butter !, 
  yup , i 'm pretty surprised myself . 
  i would expect there might be a slight difference , visible on the map . 
  but that ? 
  it totally udermines the methodology used for creation of this map for me ... 
  true . 
  and quite surprising , too ... 
  i will say : `` have you done your homework , yet ? '', 
  not every stereotype is true , though ... , 
  it surely seems that way ... maybe it 's nsa-surveillance-proof , or something ? 
  funny how the most visible contours are the seacoasts , mountain peaks and the eastern polish border o_o, 
  well put , 
  most of them are actually pretty good . 
  way better , than one would expect . 
  especially if you take into consideration that the borders are distorted ( i.e. 
  poland looks like someone has stepped on it and krolewiec district is strangely swollen ) . 
  funny thing that lithuania is always placed somewhere in central-south ... 
  thanks for the link !, 
  so you get all the penguins then . 
  this is quite surprising . 
  i must admit i 'd have some troubles with naming all the states . 
  funny thing is those i know are kind of at `` outside fringe '' . 
  the more toward the interior of usa , the more lost i get ... 
  simply hilarious !, 
  pol ( e ) and = north pole = the penguins i ca n't wrap my mind around this concept ... heh, 
  yup , can confirm . 
  that 's how it 's done . 
  source : am pole . 
  trying to be bossy , eh ? 
  seriously though , many people do n't know where poland is , so you might need to improve your startegy ... 
  oh no , not this shit again ... quickly - hide this post from the poles !, 
  poland , i think ... 
  thanks , mate . 
  i appreciate the effort . 
  well , i must say it is rather saddening comment , indeed . 
  too bad people think this way . 
  i did n't understand it ( even through gt ) so i guess i 'm ok for now . 
  funny that i had to come to reddit to learn about `` polish internet going insane '' . 
  seems like the information bubble is true after all ... 
  but they work in a lazy manner ... or something something . 
  but they make the white coal-steam , duuuh !, 
  you 're right guys - sorry about that . 
  it 's 18 - reddit official !, 
  20 poles ... nice achievement , too . 
  this is a good one !, 
  i 'm gon na memorize it . 
  nichts to be sorry about . 
  schau mal , [ what your compatriot has done ] ( https://youtu.be/iw6ldbl6qng ) lately in warsaw . 
  ( h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6 ), 
  number 2 is unbelieveable !, 
  ( nooot ! ), 
  the video was fun , thanks . 
  chaos gods speak clearly now !, 
  90 % of sailing boats parts names come from dutch in poland , 
  came here to tell the truth revealed in your ` also ' part . 
  have an upvote then !, 
  it 's just the name and general people 's tendency to simplify everything . 
  poles get lots of butthurt over the [ `` polish death camps '' thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy ) but not many other people care ... 
  spanish people are not fond of the polish `` no '' as `` yes '' . 
  it confuses them . 
  i wonder why ... 
  which freaks out the spanish ... 
  remember the good old times . 
  forget the 20th century ... much nostalgic , such power , plc stronk !, 
  polish duke - [ konrad i of masovia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_i_of_masovia ) ... what a guy !, 
  he has devised an ingenious plan to invite the teutonic order to fight for him against `` the barbarians '' on his northern border . 
  so , he has invited a foreign and one of the most resilient , powerful , religion-fueled power to his own realm . 
  [ what could possibly go wrong ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93teutonic_war ), 
  what the heck is * kartofelnyy soyuz * ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'm just not sure if you write that with `` y '' or `` i '' in german ... 
  s ** i ** lvesternach ? 
  oops , i replied to the wrong post ... 
  the translation is just below . 
  more or less : `` i am no peasant , but a noble man . 
  although a poor one '' . 
  a citation from henryk sienkiewicz 's [ ogniem i mieczem - with sword anf fire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/with_fire_and_sword ), 
  true that .
