  and just going around in big hat with sunglasses on and with very serious face while not speaking a word , might not work as well . 
  so the staff ** will know ** anyway :(, 
  hehe ... true that . 
  english is a mess in spelling rules . 
  but somehow this mess is quite easy to learn ( or is it ? ), 
  i just realised that this rule is one major difference between russian and polish . 
  never thought of that ... 
  both languages are very similar phonetically , but in polish every character is always spelled the same way . 
  what 's going to happen in the third case ? 
  just curious ... 
  uhm ... so just like in english ? 
  like ... * piazza * in squares or * quadrato * in squares ? 
  3 - according to polish mainstream media it 's because of bicycles and lego . 
  so , now you know . 
  you 're welcome . 
  4 - oh , same here !, 
  every bloody time !, 
  sooo annoying ... she 's a good tennis player ? 
  well , her grandparents were polish !, 
  he 's won the championship ? 
  well , he lived with a polish friend during his studies !, 
  they bought dutch tulips ? 
  well , they came through poland !, 
  he thanked their allies ? 
  well , he did n't forget poland this time !, 
  she 's a good actress ? 
  well , she 's been to poland !, 
  once . 
  or maybe it was her uncle ? 
  his friend 's neighbour ? 
  yup !, 
  this might be a wider scheme ... 
  might need a gradation scheme here ... 
  you 're telling us now ? 
  i love this one . 
  so much sailorship . 
  right into the feels !, 
   i still can not believe how `` cerstve pecivo '' can mean something totally opposite in two neighbouring countries ( i believe we got it wrong at some point here in poland , though ) . 
  also - czech beer many tasty !, 
  and czechs are cool . 
  * about those highways - we also claim to have the most expensive here . 
  for our internal issues , i believe . 
  yup , that 's a good idea , too . 
  however , i think the first book ( * narrenturm * ) is way better than the other two . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm adding to my list :-) i thought about recommending [ pilecki 's report ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold%27s_report ) , but the op wanted fiction only , so i resigned . 
  ** poland ** something rather light , enjoyable to read and not stupid - * the witcher * by andrzej sapkowski . 
  well , you do n't really ** have to ** learn english , do you ? 
  i always wanted to :-), 
  from the south ... 
  ( or something ), 
  i think that sums it up  thanks for expanding the topic - i 've had some problems with wording what i mean . 
  interesting notice . 
  it 's some kind of self-suggestion , i guess . 
  are you all guys playing tricks with you minds , then ? 
  yup , your 're right that stigmatising wrong behaviours is generally a good thing . 
  what i am trying to say is ... hmm ... for example how people greet each other in different cultures . 
  there is a very apparent difference between anglo-saxons and poles . 
  in the anglosphere it mostly looks something like this : * hey !, 
  how are you doing , john ? 
  * great , thanks . 
  and you , jill ? 
  * see you , then ... * see you . 
  in poland it 's going to be something like : * hello , michael . 
  and that 's it . 
  if you ask `` how are you '' in poland or any slavic country , people will actually tell you the truth . 
  and it might take a while , too . 
  * hello , michal . 
  how are you , grzesiek ? 
  * well , i 'm doing fine in general , i guess . 
  but , you know what , i do n't know why , but my leg hurts when i 'm climbing up the stairs . 
  you think it might be something serious ? 
  maybe i should go and see a doc about that ? 
  i 've also had some problems lately with my dog . 
  i can not teach it to behave . 
  i 've tried so many things i 've found on the internet and yet it still turns my flat into ... blah blah blah blaaargh ... 
  if you were to say that people in anglospehere are happier than those in poland just basing on that , it might not be actually true . 
  you know what i mean ? 
  or it seems to you i mumble something that does n't make any sense at all ? 
  probably not . 
  but in fact it 's not that hard if you remember that it symbolizes ukrainian landscape - fields of grain under blue sky :-), 
  uhm ... 
  i 'm not sure how is this relevant to what i 've written above . 
  but to keep it possibly short - yes , this is true . 
  there were very many jews in poland . 
  they were part of this country for many centuries . 
  also many of them fled germany after 1933 . 
  in my opinion it 's not possible for 3 mio people to be `` totally harmless '' . 
  obviously jews did n't form one , solid political block . 
  there were so many different jews ranging from far right to far left , from very rich businessmen to totally poor simple folk ( just like any other nation , i guess ) . 
  most of those * poor jews * were strong pro-soviet supporters and this was not well received by majority of poles ( especially the right wing ) . 
  that 's why there was quite strong anti-semmitic sentiment in poland . 
  but it never escalated to a true , massive scale . 
  most of it were the infamous [ ghetto benches ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghetto_benches ) , some local actions asking `` true poles '' not to buy at jewish shops and such . 
  the shoah / holocaust to which i believe you are referring was one of the most terrible crimes ever . 
  the fact that so many people were murdered in ruthless , methodic way is truely much more than just * sad * . 
  it 's almost unbelieveable , how this could happen . 
  this atrocious crime was part of nazi-german war machine . 
  so many people were killed by it . 
  most of them jews , but not only .
