  i 'm not spurring anyone to do it , though . 
  just saying it would probably teach them a good lesson ( way better , than a 150 euro fine or whatever they might get in reality ) . 
  they seem to feel sooo steadfast and unpunishable here ... 
  scary ... someone twice the size of those guys should return them the favor ... 
  as a guy who consciously chose to get mortgage credit in pln instead of chf , i keep wondering when will be the time that some `` political hero '' comes and saves me from my `` oppressive credit interest '' ... 
  i pay double all these years , for franks sake !, 
  thank you . 
  i will manage from here , 
  `` this video is not available in your country '' i fucking love that phrase !, 
  also ... [ this ] ( http://www.slovak-republic.org/slovenia ) , 
  i believe slovaks and czechs do . 
  polish is similar , though , 
  me neither ...  peace : , 
  well . . what can i say ? 
  `` it was destroyed / annihilated '' . . ? 
  unfortunately this is what happens ( or rather is being done ) to `` the culture '' during wars ... many examples in the history . 
  i regret each and every time :'(, 
  indeed . 
  many times !, 
  something like dungeon , i believe ... polish tourists running around and looking for dungeons are quite amusing for russians ;-), 
  looks delicious !, 
  is it made of polar bears ' sweat ? 
  also the difference between * krassneey * and * krasseeveey * and their * sklep * is something totally different than polish sklep ... 
  yesh , zis is succulent . 
  hilarity ensues ... , 
  yes , we do ...  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ) is the newest thing being talked about ... ( some people prefer to watch it muted , though ) . 
  good to know . 
  thanks , 
  hmm ... interesting . 
  never heard of that . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  ... also women !, 
  when is the trip and on which wagon ? 
  '' , though . 
  that would be grrreat , maan ... could you provide victualling , please ? 
  does n't seem that hard to me ... but maybe i pronounce it wrong . . ? 
  interesting thing about that salad ...  but - who `` every one else '' calls roller coasters `` russian mountains '' ? 
  how peculiar ... are you guys alright ? 
  i really enjoyed the series . 
  learned a lot and also had chance to brag a little about what i already knew ( yay !, 
   looking forward to anything you come up with - definitely will participate . 
  cheers !, 
  we meet again , russia !, 
  :  loong looong history of reciprocal wrongdoings between russia and poland . 
  our people tend to fall in love when they party together , but anything on the governmental level goes straight to hell . 
  poles do n't stop bragging about being the only foreign force to take over moscow in 17th century ( which is very not precise - ask historians ) . 
  russians on the other hand accuse poles of being pompous , `` betraying the slavs '' and blindly promoting `` western way of life '' . 
  this goes well with centuries old history of wars and bloodshed in general . 
  * huuuge country * european/asian state started by `` vikings '' * lots of natural resources * enormous amount of corruption - there 's enough for everyone !, 
  ... and it 's also one of the major factors why russians do n't rule the world yet  * very rich culture , unfortunately part of it was damaged by the revolution ( and also new things were created , but they do n't impress me that much ) * lots of scientists , mathematicians * very famous novels authors * choirs and ballet * orthodox church * cyrillic alphabet - coming from greek * simple folk was always living in terrible conditions there :( * nowadays everyone has a video camera in their car ( it 's strictly for our amusement ) * some of the best examples of beautiful slavic women !, 
   * some of [ the best examples of terrible taste ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/russian-dating-site-photos_n_4227971.html ) on their dating sites * not so long time ago used to be the main part of ussr - powerful and sinister ( from our point of view ) super-state * gagarin and the rest of the space program * good vodka ( origins of the liquor are another reason for us to quarrel ) * problem with alcoholism in the country ( until 2009 alcoholic beverages like beer and other with amount of alcohol lower than 10 % were consider non-alcoholic ! ), 
  * moscow is a mega-city , very different from the whole country * many really rich oligarchs who can wipe their asses with $ 100 bills all their life and wo n't even notice that * also lots of poor people * great achievements like city of st. petersburg ( leningrad ) or trans-siberian railway - as usual building procedure claimed lives of thousands * many russians are real bad-asses . 
  rambo can go home , play hopscotch ... * they do n't really like raibow people, 
  * bier * wurst * haribo * aspirin * cars , machinery * dirndl * steadfast in technicalities , numbers and science ( lots of great thinkers ! ), 
  * very precise language - great for engineers , doctors and soldiers . 
  not so great for lovers ... ;p from the polish point of view - our centuries old neighbour , enemy and reason for jealousy . 
  the first mistrust happened millennia ago when it turned out that these guys to the west , unlike our eastern and southern nieghbours , are totally mute [ niemy ( mute in polish ) -  niemcy ( germans in polish ) . ], 
  since then it 's been a place where from steady stream of brilliant ideas kept flowing , interrupted by perodical fierce , bloodlust frenzy attacks . 
  till now we keep wondering how is it possible that johann goethe came from the country that later produced ( and used ) panzerkampfwagen koenigstiger . 
  to keep it short - very smart , technically skilled people , with strange language , longing for perfectly organised society ( slavic soul can not take it ) and very peculiar love for schadenfreude ... 
  in fact they 're really great friends ( if you make friends with them ) but our women are waaay prettier ( sorry  also - guys tend to have big jaws . 
  they look more sinister but it 's also easier to hit them there :p, 
  well-written , great read . 
  thanks !, 
  but i did n't ... 
  forget about poland !, 
  i think it is ... sort of . 
  does n't apply to every pole , obviously , but these `` images '' of other nations are present in the society . 
  and they would be mostly based on the experience of the wwii and its outcome ( horrible destuction of the country 's population and infrastructure and also in effect losing the war despite of being in the `` winning team '' - sort of opposite to italy ) . 
  the prejudice is also backed by still-present inferiority complex of many poles ( which sometimes has some objective basis ) . 
  poles blame blood-thirsty germans , too !, 
  and insidious russians ... and ignorant brits ... and unreliable french ... and lithuanians ( appropriate adjective in research ) . . so do n't worry , 
  * tblisi * wine * nice views * stalin * guys great for drinking together but unfortunately quite invasive towards women * some people believe that it actually does n't belong to europe ( but rather usa ), 
  aaah ... some kind of oligarchy nowadays . 
  lots of natural resources . 
  ties with russia . 
  many years ago some polish people were sent there by russians as a form of repression for their patriotic acts . 
  big country and a bit asian i guess ...  also - sasha baron cohen made fun of them by his stupid character of borat . 
  definitely [ gniezno ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gniezno ) anyways , thanks for your work !, 
  well , if you say so ... and it 's your cakeday today ... ok , then , 
  you 've got the point :d, 
  germanic czechs ? 
  o_o no halusky for you !, 
  oh , ok ... obviously i meant that these are the countries where it is really hard to assimilate to . 
  cheers !, 
  well , that only strenghtens my choice ... racism and xenophobia are not very helpful in the assimilation process , are they ? 
  belarus is very poor country , ruled by a dictator ... 
  it 'd would be hard to assimilate there because of economic situation and the language . 
  but culturally ? 
  i do n't think they are that inimical . 
  if you 're looking for cultural causes , i 'd rather go with some place in the balkans ( like kosovo or macedonia ) . 
  or maybe some parts of russia - which differ enormously from what you 'll find in moscow . 
  you stahp your evil-doings and act like an adult or i 'll hold my breath until you vill be very sorry for what you have vrote here !, 
  nope , far to modern ... :p btw , why the germanosphair uses logo of adobe reader ? 
  could n't express that better myself , my dear sir !, 
  here , please accept this upvote as proof of my gratitude . 
  i guess japan is too well developed to be a part of europe nowadays . 
  and there might be some minor geographical issues , too ...  anyway , i personally think irish postcard written in japanese would be pretty cool !, 
  i 'd go with french postcard , written in slovak and with small appendix of halusky !, 
  gather the folks !,
