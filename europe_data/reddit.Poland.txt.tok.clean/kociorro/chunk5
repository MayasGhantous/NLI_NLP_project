  ready the pitchvolks !, 
  eunk eunk ? 
  now i feel insul ( a ) ted , too !, 
  you , westerners and all these your so called `` inventions '' !, 
  we ought to travel the way it used to be in the good ol' days !, 
  no no no ... o_o well that 's a rather `` graphic '' reaction :d, 
   solothurn funny how this place is almost in the middle in between poland and portugal ...  tempting as it is , i 'll pass on the postcard , thanks !, 
  let 's all just send those postcards to op ( 's girlfriend ) . 
  cheerio !, 
  in fact , you speak the truth ... 
  mountains , chocolate , big financial institutions , penknives and people fighting `` the abzockerei '' . 
  why do you ask ? 
  make something up ... or write it in [ elvish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elvish_languages ) or something . . , 
  ` zis seems appropriate ... good , gut ... pleaze pm the secret data and i shall command my minions to prepare ` ze postkard at ` vounce !, 
  are you sure . . ? 
  i believe in english they do n't think twice before actually moo-ing ... o_o, 
  how clever ... 0.0 i knew you guys are experts in money-handling in general , but this is got me unguarded . 
  but ... how do you pay the '' - '' itself ? 
  well , there surely are bigger tragedies in life than that ... 
  but it was n't a pleasant surprise . 
  well , i surely hope you guys wo n't forget how to do the proper yoghurt !, 
  it 's not that bad in my opinion ... but there are some hints , 
  noooooo ... !, 
  can not really tell ... 
  but i would go with assumption that we 've got many people with serious case of inferiority complex here . 
  so what they do is getting obsessed with themselves and their `` knowledge '' and if anyone questions their infallibility , they get quite mad . 
  also - that was in primary school , so ... younger kids tend to fight over the silliest of the things , 
  the empire of polish diaspora , then ? 
  i used to buy lots of it when i lived in the other part of the city ... not anymore , unfortunately . 
  it was something like [ this label ] ( http://niebowgebie.blox.pl/resource/jogo.jpg ) but with nuts , instead of fruits . 
  anyway , i remember it was very tasty , `` natural '' in the flavour and quite expensive ... gosh , i wish i could find it somewhere around here -_-, 
  shrewd move there !, 
  good enough for me . 
  apparently , that 's the one . 
  thanks !, 
  ( oh , it brings back memories ... ) :d, 
  you bring me shipment of latvian yoghurt , we call it a deal and then you can keep the fort jakob ... ; , 
  the club is growing quickly ... might need bigger sofas soon , 
   high ratings for phallus size ( o_o ) interesting ... 
  i wonder if that was based upon willing cooperation or some kind of a new nsa spying system attached to underwear retailers ... 
  good luck !, 
  bring some latvian yoghurt with you . 
  they might like it ... , 
  so that 's why you were good at sailing ... 
  i believe i used to own a deck of cards called `` zwarte piet '' ... o_o, 
  well linked , and quite informative ... 
  thank you , 
  to make things more interesting ... apart from [ indonesian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indonesia ) and [ polish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland ) , there was also [ duchy of courland 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_courland_and_semigallia ) flag ... and i do n't know why but canada took the same colours for their flag . 
  are they really so appealing ? 
  oh yeah , you 're right !, 
  inferiority complex at its best ...  well , i 'm sorry you had to deal with such morons `` made in poland '' . 
  unfortunately there are quite many poles who do n't really know that much about the world or history , but will always find a way to be resentful and then tell you what you did wrong . 
  on the other hand - we really were fucked up by the history quite a few times . 
  but if you look closely - who has n't ? 
  does n't matter , really ...  the cunning invention of flags proved great for you !, 
  no problem . 
  it 's for the science and all that ...  no wonder you get these flags mixed up , since you live upside down all the time ... :d, 
  gosh !, 
  that 's some attitude ... o_o was the `` defender of all that 's different '' polish by any chance ? 
  wall of text , but a good read , indeed . 
  thanks , 
  ( gosh , i 'm hungry ... ), 
  yup , many years ago i 've had a fight over the austria / australia thing . 
  it was in primary school . 
  i got hit in the mouth ... -_- but i was right - australia is not and never have been in europe ... 
  the other thing is slovakia / slovenia . 
  even their flags are similar !, 
  m ( o_o ) m, 
  the thing is the biggest part of that `` polish economic success '' are thousands of people working in `` the west '' and sending part of their income here , while not actually living here . 
  it 's a system far from stable ... : / i think if you manage to fend yourselves from the `` agressive '' sea , you 'll do just fine . 
  i 'll drink to that !, 
  ( but after work ) , 
  cheeeeese !, 
  thanks , i 'll try to memorize that . 
  but frankly , i might have the letters mixed up soon ... : / ( side note - i did not use google for that one , but it does n't really matter ) . 
  i 'll try to remember - it 's worth trying , 
  it 's all a matter of relativity and the point of view you want to adopt . 
  i can think of myself just as polish ... 
  but if i 'd dig a bit deeper , i can pronounce myself half-masovian , half-kresowiak ... or much much more complicated , as so many different people were there in my family . 
  your judgement looks to me like the samogitian folk point of view . 
  and probably you 're right in the most cases . 
  but , please take into consideration that in general `` the folk '' always had it really hard , wheter they were german , polish , french or lithuanian ( samogitian ? ) ... 
  it 's also very hard to refer to kingdoms of the middle ages in the way we think about today national countries . 
  and this adds to the family history , where you might have many `` foreign '' influences . 
  if you look at history of [ lithuanian nobility ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_nobility ) and the processes it went through , you might come to a conclusion that they gained quite a lot . 
  on a side note - in commonwealth there was the highest nobility ( szlachta ) to peasants ratio in whole europe ( approx . 
  the very important noble family in the commonwealth - [ radziwill / radvila ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radziwi%c5%82%c5%82 ) has self-polonised , but always stayed loyal to their lithuanian ancestry ( which many times caused major conflicts in the country as a whole ) . 
  in effect they happened to be called `` traitors '' by both poles and lithuanians ... tough luck , eh ? 
  i would say it 's really very complicated , my friend ...  the least we can do is not to you use someone 's ancestry / national background to stereotype or blame them for anything . 
  peace and keep walking !, 
  never heard of those ... o_o on a side note [ poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) used to be quite formidable in the earlier ages , though ( before the surge of oversee colonies ) . 
  we never really took part in the whole `` colonisation '' thing and frankly , i 'm happy with that  anyway , your ego wo n't gain from pointing to those you regard as lesser ( unless you are quite strange ) . 
  i think dutch people have serious reasons to be proud of their history and these in my opinion do not need the whole `` empire thing '' . 
  i understand you may prefer to differ , though , 
  ye know too much !, 
  [ ye know too much !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzwturqnpp8 ) :d, 
  same in polish - lots of sailing definitions are taken from dutch , 
  [ i 've seen bigger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:the_british_empire.png ) ;p but you 're right , of course . 
  it was an empire .
