  well , at least kind of ... :d, 
  well , i 've heard something about that . 
  but there are so many different opinions and stereotypes about `` poles in the west '' that i do n't really know ( or , in fact , care that much ) which are true ... good to know we have some specialists . 
  personally i do n't know any . 
  too bad they all ( ? ), 
  left for other countries , too , 
   but the prices could be longer imho you mean lower / cheaper ? 
  abso-mooo-tely !, 
  from my experience ... - where are you from ? 
  - poland . 
  - holland ? 
  - no , poland . 
  - look , here is holland - the netherlands , here lays germany , deutsch , you know , and here poland ... polonia ... the ... ah , whatever . 
  yup , i 'm from somthing-oland . 
  does n't matter :p, 
  to me it sounds a bit like a drunk german is trying to speak english . 
  i pick some words ... some mumbling ... some more words ... 
  i feel like i 'm about to understand the whole sentence , just on the verge of enlightement ... and then it all collapses into some nonsense :(, 
  ... forgot about polders ( flevoland ) , tulips and horticulture in general , windmills and everywhere present wooden shoes + klm toys : i, 
  the heaven for cyclists . 
  good with money handling and trade . 
  used to be an empire ( well , kind of ) . 
  great painters in the past . 
  legal mj and other `` drugs '' . 
  red lanterns street in amsterdam . 
  very expensive flats . 
  nowadays lots of immigrants , what causes tensions ( no wonder ) . 
  also - [ m. c. escher ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m._c._escher ) rather easy-going in general . 
  good looking women who know what they want . 
  one of my personal favourite countries , i must say . 
  yup , i especially remember the last one . 
  that was on my checklist for saturday . 
  glad i managed . 
  i 'm pretty busy , you see ... 
  i would go with this one - [ komes zloty ] ( http://www.browarfortuna.pl/nasze_piwa/potrojny_zloty/ ) but it 's obviously my subjective opinion ... 
  there are many good beers , especially form micro-breweries , 
  can not say . 
  poland is all flooded with viagra ( or smurfs ) ... 
  to put it simple : not that many in big cities ( but still some ) , formidable masses in the countryside ... 
  with a huge polish viagra pill to the south ... ;p, 
  but what about the film festival ? 
  women , pivo , architecture & movies . 
  they 're also really easy going and do n't have many religious crazies . 
  who does n't ? 
  not much really ( sorry ) . 
  i know they produce cheap and rather good wine . 
  i remember something about medieval `` principality of moldavia '' from my history classes . 
  i also know their capital city has funny name in polish - kiszyniow ( you may translate that as `` the place of pickle '' ) o_o, 
  serious shit ... o_o, 
  our ( polish ) neighbour with some great stories in the old days . 
  and some more not-so-great stories , later on . 
  it turned out that in [ the commonwealth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) the things were out of balance and apparently poles were gaining much and lithuanians did n't . 
  we 've had a lot of history happen between us and nowadays we do n't really like each other in general . 
  poles learn in primary school that lithuanians were our bff , but anyway they tend to treat them arrogant and with disregard . 
  lithuanians on the other hand have built significant part of their national consciousness as a contrary to the `` bad poles '' ( they have their [ reasons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski's_mutiny ) , too ) . 
  our worst nightmare came true for them - they were sucked into ussr after the wwii . 
  nowadays ... good dairy products , even better bread . 
  nice alcohol , too . 
  rather tight-lipped , calm people . 
  it 's hard to melt the ice on the beggining but if you do - great , sincere friends !, 
  they have a female president - something we 'll have to wait a long time to get here . 
  i like them . 
  also - robert bruneika !, 
  vewy twue , thank you . 
  well , both come and go nowadays , i guess ... but actually zabookowa\u0107 might be more popular . 
  you 're right :-), 
  yup , well done . 
  this text is so old that it 's even hard for poles to fully comprehend . 
  you 've won !, 
  there are quite many . 
  the first few : * kamera - ** video ** camera * weekend - weekend * komputer - computer * rewolwer - revolver * ( za ) check ( owa\u0107 ) - to check-in/out , to reserve ( a room in hotel ) * biznes - business and lots and lots of vocabulary related to corporates ( management , info sheets , compliance , assistants , blah blah blah ... ), 
  damn ... 
  well , because [ mi aerodeslizador est\u00e1 lleno de anguilas ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirty_hungarian_phrasebook ) ... , 
  oh yeah , that 's the one . 
  thanks a lot , 
  oh , i know  `` do dna ! '', 
  in polish . 
  :  i like the meaning and i also prefer this toast as it 's easier to remember than the other ( eszesw-something ... sorry , do n't remember ) . 
  cheers , then !, 
  forgot about omega and sz-s in my post . 
  thanks !, 
  feast time !, 
  lecso , hot peppers , wine ( egri bikaver , but not only ) , nice people , beautiful girls , nice weather , superb architecture in budapest , public steam-rooms , mean ticket inspectors in the subway ( see movie kontroll ) . 
  we like each other in general ( pole speaking ) . 
  the best heavy cavalry in history ( polish husaria ) had its begginings in hungary . 
  istvan bathory & p\u00e1l teleki ( thank you ! ) . 
  also - [ year 1956 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) i like hungary and hungarians much but their language is a mystery to me ... fen\u00e9kig !, 
  when i read it was pripyat , i instantly thought of shadow over chernobyl ... 
  there might some biiig animals out there !, 
  serious strategic mistake !, 
  surely , soviets did . 
  but i think it should be considered from the polish point of view ... 
  anyway , i do n't mean to clamor in vain . 
  just wanted to say that for many poles , including myself , sentencing this guy to death and then executing in such barbaric way plus secretly burying the body is far from ` not wrong ' , especially because most allegations were fabricated . 
  thats all folks . 
  have a nice day everyone :-), 
  sure . 
  but also europe is becoming more and more either atheist or muslim , so ... 
  it 's relative . 
  well , i would strongly disagree .
