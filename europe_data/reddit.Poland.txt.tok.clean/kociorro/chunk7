  he was working for ii corps of polish army . 
  although it was in exile in london ( just as the government ) it was still the legitimate . 
  what was later done with his reports was none of his business . 
  he was a soldier and worked for the polish army . 
  in fact , i 'd risk saying that people who shot him in the back of his head after a year of tortures were subjects of foreign ( soviet ) imperialism , which occupied the country :(, 
  seriously badass :-), 
  aaa ... meaning what ? 
  apparently happened a few times , 
  [ somewhere around 1570 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx00ojiwcim ) ? 
  not sure , though ... 
  it 's probably because they could n't figure out your nationality , so they did n't know if you 're good or bad -_-, 
  i knew there must be a catch somewhere ... -_- oh , well ... 
  adopt , adapt , improve . 
  ho hum , let 's get on with it !, 
  heads up oh gals , here i come !, 
  you 've got my sword and paintbrush and pizza cutter !, 
  well put , my lord ... well put , indeed . 
  i would strongly advise on getting full ones , instead of empty :-p the rule is it 's going to be empty after , not before you meet :-d but unfortunately it is costly indeed ... absolut and finlandia are ok in my opinion . 
  but to get more `` slavic '' ones , try krupnik , wyborowa , zoladkowa , zubrowka or nemiroff ( ukrainian ) . 
  also belvedere is great , but again - expensive . 
  take care , drink responsively and so on ... :-), 
  there there ... no need to feel bad for yourself . 
  it 's probably because of your flair-flag ... `` yurop stronk , murica bad '' way of thinking . 
  yup , they could n't decide if it 's monaco or indonesia , so they got frustrated ... , 
  heh , maybe not that bad . 
  but i never enjoyed siwucha myself . 
  strange aftertaste ... o_o more likely i would go with one of [ these bottles ] ( http://socialcomposition.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/chopin-vodka-screenshot.png ) . 
  preferably the middle one , 
  well ... yes , that 's acceptable . 
  you have my blessing !, 
  if pierogi were served hot , she 's gon na be hot too ... 
  the real secret is to cook lots of them but then you got ta have some friends or so who will eat most of them , 
  are you serious ?!, 
  you tricky russian ... we 've seen through your true identity !, 
  thanks !, 
  actually that sounds pretty good !, 
  ehm ... from clearly linguistic point of view , of course !, 
  ` zis means waaah !, 
  oops ... so they either do n't know of the `` mouse pointer hovering over the flair '' trick or they only use mobile version of reddit . 
  anyway , take care - you 'll get through this somehow !, 
  edit : forgot to add that apparently they have their monitors set upside-down . 
  quite unusual ... 
  from my experience 3/4 of this `` loathing '' is happening in the media , so please do n't get too frustrated ;-), 
  apparently they did n't want to talk to you as well as to us ... ;-), 
  well , ok then :-), 
  what do you mean `` actual '' ? 
  if you think about cities ' current names , then sweidnitz is outdated . 
  if you mean `` currently being a part of the country '' , then klaipeda , siauliai and kaunas are definitely in the wrong place ... : /, 
  [ british movie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptijncdanvw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) about those guys ... :-), 
  sure , our pilots were highly motivated to fight germans after what they have seen in their homeland . 
  but there were many czechoslovak pilots , too . 
  anyway , 303 squadron did really well , as far as i know . 
  drop your panties , sir william ; i can not wait until lunchtime !, 
  well , yeah . 
  it 's always tough choice :-(, 
  i would recommend trying to watch the charge not from the first line of their enemies , though ... 
  this is great summary !, 
  sure is !, 
  high five for finns !, 
  wall of text , but i enjoyed that . 
  thanks !, 
  good for you , even better for them !, 
  interesting read , thanks a lot !, 
  is [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/r7ge_depzm0 ) relevant ? 
  you 've had enough before ;p, 
  bier !, 
  maybe you 're right ... 
  the may 3rd constitution was important . 
  other important document is [ warsaw confederation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation ) - light of religious freedom in rather dark times . 
  i 'll also add the [ pleograph ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleograph ) , [ kerosene lamp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerosene_lamp ) and [ bigos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) then , 
  yup , wilno definitely was a serious issue . 
  but this manuveur ... 
  surely it did the trick for us , so it was efficient . 
  but not very honorable . 
  definitely nothing to be proud of . 
  so now - i like lithuanians and their yoghurt but they do n't like me , you see ... 
  this sounds funny coming from a pole , but ... people would die . 
  lots of them . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks , will try to get my hands at it . 
  by the way - beautiful plumage !, 
  should i switch to [ opium tea ] ( http://youtu.be/qb2blmeyrak ) then ? 
  cheerio !, 
  may i get a quick explanation , please ? 
  i do n't know what 's happening there ... :(, 
  personally i prefer it without sugar or milk ... ( gross , i know ) . 
  i know you do n't produce tea , but if it was n't for the british empire i would probably be sipping some dirty water or cheap beer and then i would get sacked for using alcohol at workplace and then i would n't be able to pay my rent and then i 'd have to go to the forests and hunt down coypu and i would hurt myself , get infected with tetanus and die alone under weeping willow ... ;( well , thanks for bringing the tea !, 
  what about the tea ? 
  to keep it short ( poles can talk about their `` moral victories '' for hours ) i 'd pick these three : poles in moscow : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93muscovite_war_ ( 1605 % e2 % 80 % 9318 ) #poles _ in_moscow _ .281610.29 [ battle of vienna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) battle of warsaw in 1920 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 ), 
  well , yeah ... that too . 
  never heard of that uprising . 
  thanks . 
  gosh !, 
  i would pick these three : [ polonization in kresy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonization#polonization_in_eastern_borderlands_.28kresy.29 ) ; taking part in the [ warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) - we were a soviet puppet country back then , but anyways ; and the third probably would be [ \u017beligowski 's mutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski's_mutiny ) sorry :(, 
  better late than never , i guess ... 
  i love the `` sweidnitz '' , too . 
  something is wrong here ... 
  scary , too ... 
  what the heck is competition eater ? 
  well , sure !,
