  but i thought about trying to get help from unsuspecting stangers :d, 
  as far as i know it 's not a good idea to ` szukac ' anything in czech or slovakia ... 
  well , i 'm holding my thumbs / fingers crossed ( whatever works ) for the best for both lithuania and poland . 
  sorry to hear . 
  i was n't even aware of this situation . 
  me no likely ... :-(, 
  if you do n't know why poles get touchy or angry about ww2 , read [ this man 's ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) biography :-), 
  but seriously , i like slovakia and slovaks a lot :-), 
  great description . 
  thanks !, 
  true true ... 
  gosh , what abortion has to do with ethnic disputes ? 
  this is crazy :-(, 
  the latter thing is a nightmare for many poles ... 
  sorry guys !, 
  exactly !, 
  funny thing is that i always have a great time with lithuanians , whenever i meet them . 
  the only ` broken thing ' seems to be ` the big politics ' ... 
  also - stupid stupids !, 
  and the latter thing drives some people nuts here ;-), 
  well , it 's about time !, 
  =-o but anyway ... ** 1,389,289 landmines ** ? 
  did the wehrmacht have some explosives diarrhea ? 
  these are some serious numbers !, 
  you 're right !, 
  < winkwink  ** i was joking , guys . 
  nothing to see here . 
  just move on , please ... **, 
  might be ... depends on the case , i guess , 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  i might have watched the movie ... 
  but i ca n't recall it right now precisely : / will put it on my list , though , 
  well , i certeinly hope so ... as i would n't see any justified reason to stats quo ... , 
  or pms ... 
  that 's the spirit , soldier !, 
  keep up the good work , 
  the irish football fans were a big news last year . 
  they were voted the best to cheer and party with . 
  there was definitely some good time our people had together  the sad thing was that one of your guys got drunk and drowned in ... bydgoszcz i think . 
  poor bloke . 
  it casted terrible shadow on the whole experience : / anyway - i would say taking a cheap flight and coming over for some partying and a bit of sightseeing is definitely worth trying !, 
  no idea , man . 
  but i think most of these plans were made in moscow , so we might ask them later ... 
  hehe , as far as i love dutch ( the country , people , their mentality and way of life ) i never could really get over with the language ... not to offend anybody , but for me it sounds a bit like a drunk german trying to speak english ... 
  i catch a word or two out of the sentence and then i have to remind myself that i do n't know that language and my mind might as well just give up yet . 
  poles on the other hand have very ssss ... ssssh...-ing language , so let 's call it a draw , 
  yup , that might actually work , 
  in the country side - unfortunately so . 
  but if you look on the streets of warsaw - there are more and more people with dark skin and it 's no big deal anymore . 
  many of them are tourists but some live here . 
  they often do something they 're way better than poles at . 
  restaurants with original cuisine , salsa dancing lessons , and so on ... maybe it 's not `` normal for everyone '' yet , but we 're certainly moving that way . 
  full speed ahead , mr. cohen !, 
  fetch me another exotic salute !, 
  well , you 'll need to invest in governmental payments for the hair dye then ... or try to change sexuality of those lonely poles ( might be tricky ) or ... 
  i do n't know . 
  good luck , anyway !, 
  but you 're refering to the language and i thought about ethnicity ( skin colour , ethnic background ) ... 
  things are changing - especially in the largest cities . 
  i do n't live in ireland , so can not really refer to the situation , but i know that many poles like redheads ... 
  so if you have them , there ought to be some kind of balance ... , 
  had to google stilon ... well all i can say is what you wrote is not a complete vision ... hopefully !, 
  i rarely become a tank myself , but i must agree with you ... 
  if i remember correctly sweden was the only country that thought it 's appropriate to apologise about an invasion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) ** 350 years later ** . 
  amusing , 
  true . 
  first cannon fodder and then fallout wastelands ... : i, 
  how could we loose the pole position to lithuania ?!, 
  just you wait , until appropriate politicians will get to know this !, 
  well , in poland wearing tracksuits everyday would put you in a group of rather stigmatized crooks ( from the point of view of the rest ) . 
  we have our own version of the song ( different lyrics ) and there is quite big sailing community in poland . 
  mostly in masurian lakes district , but also on the sea-side . 
  also `` sailor 's taverns '' are very popular in warsaw which is totally , like ... inland . 
  songs about jolly roger , marco polo , cutty sark , lots of alcohol , rather kinky girls and so on ... aye aye , captain !, 
  obviously the drunkard !, 
  ca n't you see that ? 
  ;p frankly , most of the time i stay in poland , so i 'm not in any of the groups i was refering to ( migrants ) . 
  but when i visit abroad , i always behave well . 
  from my point of view - if you visit , play by the local rules and be nice . 
  if something seems strange to you , take note , think about it , but do n't instantly criticize . 
  being a boor is another thing , but i never noticed that about myself ( would need an external audit to be sure ) . 
  the sad thing is that if i hear ( loud ) polish voices somewhere in a `` touristic place '' , i prefer to walk the other way < foreveralone  . 
  i know and i cringe inside ... : /, 
  trivia fact . 
  during the times of warsaw pact ( communist block ) according to the plan , polish forces were to [ attack denmark ] ( http://coldwarsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/p1000452-www-384x248.jpg ) . 
  many polish officers learnt danish and vice-versa ... 
  in the big cities and amongst younger generation - not that catholic anymore ... 
  your remarks on the love for the last letters of the alphabet made me giggle . 
  my name in polish is krzysztof , so i should know :d and about those bisons ... where are bisons , there is bison grass , and where is bison grass , there 's [ bison grass vodka - zubrowka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbubr%c3%b3wka ) a la votre !, 
  i feel for you . 
  this definitely is an issue . 
  i 'm getting mad ( inside , as i 'm doing my best at `` being placable and helpful '' at all those cross-eyed ... persons , wandering around the bicycle paths . 
  unfortunately it 's going to take years to educate people on that matter . 
  warsaw 's chief traffic technician was famous 10 years ago or so for saying officially that `` warsaw is a big city , not a shit-hole village , so there 's no place for cyclists here '' . 
  but i have to admit it 's improving really quickly for the last few years . 
  there 's hope and i want to believe !, 
  the hood definitely needed some polishing !, 
  * polishing * . 
  guys , hey guys , you get it ?!, 
  polishing !,
