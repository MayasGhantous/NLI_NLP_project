  there is a difference between enjoying the idea , and taking actions . 
  sorry to be this guy , but not thought police in action yet . 
  really ? 
  not wanting mass immigration from black african countries means no respect for democracy ? 
  tell me , which country had the quality of life improved by increasing the number of tribal/clan muslim africans ? 
  which country with majority being muslim african would you chose to live in and raise your kids in ? 
  and last , even if they openly state disrespect towards democracy , does it make them equal to germans murdering certain groups of people ? 
  there is a difference between opinion and action . 
  what they did that you consider them equal to nsdap ? 
  itt , using `` nazis '' to discredit anyone not welcoming mass african immigration . 
  what is wrong with being white ? 
  nope , far from it . 
  stop using this insult for anyone thinking more right than you . 
  please do n't make equal eu freedom of movement with mass immigration of black africans, 
   the fact that they called themselves `` left '' is just a cruel joke indeed ... to be honest , pis does same great job for `` right '' , 
  more like big cities / medium-small cities division . 
  i think you are mostly correct . 
   this is bigger than the black protest against the total abortion ban . 
  one important difference , black protest was more broad across the political spectrum , female pis supporters took part as well . 
  this time it is more anti-pis protest than pro supreme court . 
   we demonized the left the so called `` left '' was too much post commie to get support from typical left voters , sld was way too much connected with business . 
  them being post pzpr did not help either . 
  pis did a smart move and managed to get `` social '' label for themselves . 
  oh they failed , but they tried so soo hard , they just did n't manage . 
  does sicily actually benefits of the africans arriving ? 
  i mean he should be aware this is human trafficking , they are not really rescued sailors of the troubled waters . 
  i have my opinion , that is correct . 
  it does not change that them climbing the roof building to display a banner is hardly a `` gang '' activity . 
  when there is action , there is reaction , get used to this word . 
  because it is biased against them . 
  you do n't need to know much about them to get the feeling from reading the article . 
  i asked about them to see if the bias was ** justified ** , meaning weather they had a record of dangerous extreme actions , which may indicate they will continue in such a fashion . 
  i do n't see this an disingenuous . 
  apparently the rest just stood peacefully and photo would not be cover worthy , 
  what is wrong in asking questions ? 
  they are called extremists here , i asked how they earned that `` extremist '' name . 
  out of the responses , i do n't really see any activity being such extreme . 
  what part you do n't understand , asking questions or checking answers . 
  what is wrong with discussion ? 
  from the article : `` the group drove a rental truck toward the building , narrowly missing an official . 
  people then took a 10-meter ( 32-foot ) ladder and tried to ** climb onto the roof of the ministry ** , while throwing pyrotechnics , a police spokesperson told national daily `` die welt '' . 
  if it was greenpeace , everyone would approve as that is their daily shit . 
  well , at some point of the journey these 50 + young male immigrants realize the direction is not ok . how they want to stop them from taking over the ship , some may be already experienced somali . 
  extremism ( and many other - isms ) is an emotionally loaded term . 
  it is not simply statement of political affiliation , but used as a judgment . 
  extremist is a person you do n't want to waste time talking to . 
  po+n can get thousands of people on the streets , but it is not significant number to be reflected in polls . 
  pis has lower support in big cities , so it may seem from the warsaw point of view that outrage is massive , which is not the case . 
  people protesting now , were mostly anti-pis since a long time , they use the opportunity to voice their objection . 
  i do n't think they qualify for extremist , unless you use your own vocabulary . 
  they are for sure far right group , stating some radical ( at this moment ) opinions . 
  still , their actions are not extreme , they obey the rules . 
  kind of peaceful for an extremist . 
  yes , far-right is fair statement , extremist is not in this case . 
  extremism is type of action . 
  calling someone an extremist is a judgement . 
   if you do n't like a law you do n't use the force to change it , you elect someone to change the law . 
  be careful , the law may not be in line with current eu direction . 
  so they had a demonstration , this is what they are most famous of . 
  really , you want to call extremist anyone that you disagree with ? 
  how do you call them if they start rioting and looting shops ? 
  you use a term which primary meaning is crime related . 
  you use it for group which only blame is voicing opinions that you disagree with . 
  that is low blow . 
  i would say it is what they ** do ** to achieve what they want matters . 
  unless you want to categorize people based on their opinions not actions . 
  it is still allowed in europe to voice opinion , or desire . 
  extremism starts where you take actions outside of the allowed spectrum . 
  so what do you mean by using the word `` gang '' ? 
  what they did ? 
  what about the `` gangs '' you mentioned ? 
  nothing about them in this interview . 
  are they ? 
  never heard of them , what are some of their extreme actions ? 
   read about these identitarian gangs google knows nothing about them . 
  share a source ? 
  there is ( or maybe used to be ) difference between `` groups like these '' and reputable news sources , like dw . 
  slightly ? 
  it starts with : `` european right-wing extremists . . '', 
  he is a very good speaker . 
  but , after some years it became obvious there is not much more about him , other than pretty words . 
  yea , po did very little in general , kind of drifted along eu . 
  pis took over and made some significant changes to social spendings , education , tax collection . 
  people may/may not agree , but the fact is they are doing many of what was promised pre election . 
  that is the reason for many poles not to take opposition ( rightful or not ) current activity serious . 
  oh you [ joker ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/08/cbsbeee005049_20170707_bsmfn0a001_11n.jpg ) you, 
  with the point being , people are too dumb to grasp the idea of how much a fraction of % is ? 
  what a time to be alive ,, 
  happend with facebook and google , be prepared for win-xiu the panda ,, 
  poles do n't want to take migrants - bad poles , 1 million ukrainians working in poland - `` this creates conditions for hatred to thrive . '', 
  - bad poles ,, 
  not even done yet , to be honest , just a project . 
  po should focus on being an efficient opposition party first . 
  you need to win election to make law , does not seem now like this is going to happen very soon . 
  there are usually two sides of the story , you present one , u/tartyron another . 
  neither of you should be dramatic of another sharing opinion . 
  the situation in poland is not as simple as you present , there ** is ** a reason to reform judiciary system . 
  it is easy to say the way pis does that is arrogant and `` power hungry '' , but i doubt if any reform here is possible unless you change the whole system . 
  judges are known for supporting each other and will block any reform they can . 
  38 not 40 is the population , the ones that can vote is approx 30 .
