  600 , no questions asked , 
  swedes so far stay on their side of the water , but we keep an eye on them . 
  shit , i missed that , how much did they pay ? 
  poles have some [ experience ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93ottoman_wars ) with islam states . 
  this is present in the history and poles do remember that islam means conquer . 
  i was under an impression they were mandatory across europe . 
  how else can you control the disease spread ? 
  no jokes of vodka ,, 
  cool , can they call for bigger boobs on the next session ? 
   actually , we 're one of the youngest societies in the eu , it 's just that our birth rate nowadays sucks well , one factor to us being young is lower life expectancy , hence less old people  still valid point . 
  yoda into politics went ? 
  wow , such an unbiased article  . 
  if kaczy\u0144ski was walking on the water , the economist would say he ca n't swim . 
  i am not even mad ,, 
  nah , would not see that , magnifier glass was lost . 
  now go to saudis and check how shitty it to be an atheist . 
  and people wonder why we want to make business with trump and not fully trust eu ( aka germany + france ) . 
  100 % real atheism is a religion , you ** believe ** in it , you fight ** non-believers ** like christian , muslim . 
  it is basically the same chemistry in brain , but the `` god '' is different . 
  you `` declare '' yourself to be an atheist , a bit similar to feminist . 
  your mom did not approve you being an atheist ? 
  the thing is they are pulling the opposite direction with their powerhorse ,, 
  czechs have a thing for proper naming , might be something about being from czech republic xd, 
  let 's focus on making this a place people want to visit and move to . 
  i do n't care how they call it , but it is up to us what meaning the name has . 
  anyway , good luck on the crusade , 
  your impression is correct . 
  being in your neighborhood contributed a bit , 
  right , but even here you need to make wise choices and have some luck . 
  see ukraine , among our `` care unit '' , they are worst shape , while we started in similar conditions . 
  that is lost cause , people need bipolar terms , good/bad , black/white , wealthy/poor and west/east . 
  let it go and have some czech eastern beer . 
   i saw many poles complain about ... 
  it is in the mind , people still consider complimenting their jobs as bragging and being impolite . 
  poles complain as a habit , it was shitty here for a loooong time . 
  it will take some time to readjust . 
  well , last 250 years of polish history is mostly resistance against germany and russia , not aggression . 
  but i see you 've already made up your mind . 
  it is europe , there is no nation ( still present ) on this continent which was not an aggressor once . 
  well , seems you do n't know much about the first one either . 
  it was a [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war ) , what do you expect ? 
  something more common back then . 
  both states were newly formed and fighting for land . 
  not remotely close to now . 
  pis may be considered stupid or harmful , but they are very predictable . 
  easy to say if you do n't share a border with the brothers from russia , 
  really ? 
  this is your best ? 
  100 years ago failed plot and 17th century voting mechanism ? 
  and these ** shitty things ** were ? 
  we have [ bractwa kurkowe ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=bractwo+kurkowe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiv-bed3phuahxjthqkhcicd5cq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ) , they come in many flavors and even have own `` king '' . 
  perfect , i am sure the club you are in does that . 
  good for you . 
  still , some prefer to spend their time in a different way . 
  do n't force people to change what they like . 
  there are plenty of opportunities around for anyone and there is no need to tailor everyone 's playground according to one 's desires . 
  diversity is our strength . 
  oh do n't worry , we are not even getting close to your levels . 
  what ? 
  i answered you questions , simple as that . 
  you said :  it depends on the actual reasons for a club to be men or women only . 
  tell me why a particular shooting club needs to restrict membership to men only , i answered , again , not us to judge . 
   i 'll agree with you as long as there are equivalent opportunities for women to participate in mixed clubs and women only clubs . 
  again , answer is yes , they have , no law in place to stop them . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the reason might be to spend time in men-only company , or simply just wanting it to be this way . 
  who are you to claim authority to judge someone 's reasons ? 
  it is their freedom , not hurting anyone . 
  there is no law to prohibit women in forming women only organisations . 
  women have all the opportunities they want in this matter , especially in the `` west '', 
  they are them ,, 
   in the late medieval period , richly dressed africans were mascots of the wealthy and the guilds , acting as ornaments at events and decoration at processions . 
  not exactly what multicultural means . 
  same as saying stockholm was always african area , because of the zoo . 
  what is wrong with some clubs being men or women only ? 
  over 80.000 migrants crossed the sea this year . 
  does not seem to be this of a hell , as there were a lot of migrants from bangladesh , nigeria or morocco among them . 
  they were certainly not running away from war , they are entering war zone ( libya ) on purpose to improve their material status , aka get benefits . 
  it [ does not ] ( http://www.theafricancourier.de/europe/asylum-seekers-use-multiple-identities-to-defraud-german-city-of-millions-of-euros/ ) always work well . 
  there are simply too many of them to keep it under control . 
  nah , he can change his name , age , origin and apply in germany again . 
  take a flight to tripoli first . 
  rest is easy , go swimming and they will fish you out of water . 
   but a spokesman for the libyan coast guard claimed the ngos were acting inside libyan coastal waters in breach of international law . 
  more than 84,000 migrants have landed in italy this year , and 12,000 in the past few days . 
  the past three years have shown june to september to be when migrants numbers peak . 
   libyan coast guard spokesman ayyoub qasem accused the ngos of `` encouraging illegal immigrants -- who flock to libya from over 30 african countries -- and not worrying at all about libya 's sovereignty over its territory and its territorial waters . ''  he claimed the rescue groups were acting in open violation of libyan maritime sovereignty , adding that the number of migrants embarking from libya had risen 20 % since last year despite measures designed to reduce the flow . 
  `` this is a clear indication that the measures taken to stop or reduce the phenomenon are partly wrong -- or rather increase the number of migrants and smugglers , '' he said . 
  so at the moment ngos actions sabotage the libyan attempts to stabilize the situation . 
  [ un reports ] ( http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205 ) on the migrants demographics/ethnics seems to agree with the libyans on the matter . 
   careful with the ~ ~ planes ~ ~ drones . 
  it is `` pepe mr. platypus '' , you peasant . 
  most common will be `` xx minutes past midnight '' ,, 
  this kind of studies should differentiate between faith and just keeping rituals . 
  religion customs are important part of our civilization , while the true belief in the old white-bearded guy ( whom may , or may not have family ) is fading away , even in poland . 
  sneaky germans will bring them in buses ,, 
  oh i am sure he already picked the ones to get fired , 
  polish people travel more and more , they come back with experiences from paris , london , frankfurt . 
  they have their own opinions on the 2nd/3rd gen of mena imigrants . 
  meanwhile [ this many ] ( http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205 ) `` libyans '' entered italy this year .
