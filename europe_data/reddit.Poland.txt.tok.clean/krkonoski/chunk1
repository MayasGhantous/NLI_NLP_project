who knows ? 
  tamgas in polish heraldry are really intriguing . 
  but they are probably closer to iranians , i think . 
  btw https://borissoff.wordpress [ dot ] com/posts /, 
  there is a very great resistance among historians and archaeologists , but for every biologist this case is already clear . 
  genetics has the plus that it is based on scientific methods , not presumptions .

  on : http://www.forumbiodiversity.com/forumdisplay.php/7-europe http://www.forumbiodiversity.com/forumdisplay.php/30-linguistics a lot of reading . 
  many posts are with references to scientific papers and so on . 
  nope . 
  for y-dna haplogroups the results are very similar . 
  i studied biology and linguistics ( evolution of languages specifically ) is also merely hobby for me . 
  i sank in this topic completely a few years ago , when i accidentally came across the text about the similarity of slavic languages and sanskrit . 
  if you want i can send you later a bunch of interesting links . 
  as you can see `` those who can not speak '' are already down-voting me . 
  just like in poland , v-vi century , swamps etc. 
  definitely !, 
  i refer only to central europe . 
  italy and north africa is a completely different matter .

  are you biologist/historian/archaeologist maybe ? 
  edit : or linguist ? 
  e2 : which version of slavs origin is taught in the czech republic ? 
  recent genetic studies are rather against this hypothetical `` migration period '' . 
  and westerners from brussels know czech language ? 
  so maybe they should learn . 
  in poland german and russian bombs are almost everywhere ... but it is n't a big problem , really . 
  i 'm more worried about chemical weapons sunk in baltic sea .

  in the meantime - http://i.imgur.com/mkqfwo3.jpg - map from fb/avoidhungary profile spotted among refugees on kos . 
  it 's a part of the deal . 
  yesterday in secret negotiations under pressure from mutti merkel we accepted german sense of humour instead of part of refugees . 
  writing `` migrants '' i meant british companies such as tesco . 
  funny thing : [ jack cohen , the son of jewish migrants from poland , founded tesco in 1919 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tesco#origins ), 
  so ... british products and companies around the world are `` economic parasites '' ? 
  ok , but we have a lot of british `` migrants '' in poland too . 
  it works both ways ...

  you should n't change the flair . 
  it 's a [ flag of whole europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) , not only eu . 
  maybe because that central europe was forced too many times to `` accept '' quotas of germans and russians ? 
  maybe not the first time germany force us to a new religion ? 
  it seems that the white-and-blue flags bring bad luck ... especially in economy .

  imagine that your family receives a package of \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437-200 . 
  new holiday season - this time syria !, 
  umh , like v4 ? 
  and this is exactly what v4 proposed , but back then we were depicted as heartless selfish ungrateful racist bigots . 
  you mean censorship ? 
  i know , but something we must assume . 
  12 % is with border on emba river . 
  maybe 14 . place is with border on ural river ... other proposals leave kazakhstan outside europe , i think . 
  12 % of kazakhstan is located in europe , 88 % in asia . 
  and if we count whole country kazakhstan should be number two . 
  it 's huuuuge . 
  should n't kazakhstan be between finland and poland ?

  ok , maybe two decades . 
  on this chart is rather tree decades , not four . 
  but this is not accurate . 
  you 've forget about ukrainians , belarusians , lithuanians and poles who have `` changed country '' without moving from their home . 
  you know , in soviet union you do n't cross the border . 
  the border cross you . 
  it 's absurd . 
  not europe , not european nations . 
  only capitalists need immigrants . 
  after the wwii population of poland rebuilt itself in something like ... one decade ? 
  just give us the opportunity ... to find a job , to buy a flat . 
  we have paid you for this possibility and i hope that you understand how we did it .
