   eastern europe has relatively little experience with immigration on a large scale no . 
  we have a lot of experience . 
  with the new religion imposed by the germans . 
  with migrants and refugees , e.g. 
  from germany ( they settled , until we lost our land ) . 
  we have experience with liberal multi-ethnic countries that have slowly fell until they were torn by our beloved neighbours . 
  in the end , we had countless internal conflicts leading to civil wars and fratricide on a frightening scale . 
  that 's why we like our present national states . 
  but such map actually may cause this ... if it 's not accurate . 
  actually they [ did this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/russia-jails-estonian-police-officer-allegedly-abducted-border-eston-kohver ) last year . 
  so ... if you do n't want to be run over by a car it means you hate cars ? 
  we `` hate '' rather incompetent european politicians , than refugees or migrants .

  [ preventive war on germany ] ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/1874988?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ), 
  not against any refugees or migrants . 
  in poland we have a lot of ukrainians . 
  we have [ greek refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_greek_civil_war#poland ) . 
  we have vietnamese , tatars ... and we like them all !, 
  w-w-w-hat ? 
  o_o first of all ... in the old eu it 's quite fair game , because all countries have money . 
  we did n't have any money to buy any western company when we entered eu . 
  polish companies were almost wiped out from the market . 
  it was a huge cost of the eu membership and you 're telling us that we want money only ? 
  : / you know that from every euro from eu funds ~ 0.80 returns to germany ? 
  you know that good infrastructure in poland is also your interest ( trade with east ) ? 
  yes . 
  you pay . 
  ** and you earn money **, 
  who feel this ? 
  french ? 
  actually orange is paying themselves . 
  they bought tp and changed name to transfer additional cash for license to the west . 
  we could choose the japanese/korean way , but instead we entered eu . 
  yes , we can travel and work across eu . 
  yes , we have eu funds . 
  but ** it 's not aid ** . 
  all your patents and trademarks are respected . 
  you 've gained almost 40 million market to sold your products free of any additional taxes . 
  you 've bought polish companies cheap eliminating any competition in future . 
  you 're exploiting polish cheap labour . 
  so no ... it 's not aid , it 's just a deal . 
  we do n't get anything for free from eu . 
  economic aid from the eu ? 
  it 's aid when billions are transferred to the west by western companies ? 
  now give me numbers about western companies exploiting polish market . 
  former national polish telecommunication operator pays ** 1.6 % of income ** to orange ( french national operator ) just for using `` orange '' name . 
  first thing , which spaniards did after buying bank ( in which i have my bank account ) was transferring billions to santander to rescue them . 
  there are examples of german companies that bought polish ones just to shut them off .

  there is one sign that slavs could use something similar to quipu : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wici https://youtu.be/lioin41xl9c?t=2h22m6s but probably we will never find out if its true .

  [ man dies after tapeworm inside him gets cancer ] ( http://www.livescience.com/52695-tapeworm-cancer.html ), 
   just look at germany - it was never a great colonial power and at the end of ww2 it looked pretty much flattened out ( at least in the east ) this is how `` german '' border looked before `` drang nach osten '' : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/germanische_und_slavische_volksstaemme_zwischen_elbe_und_weichsel.jpg, 
  for me it 's even possible that : raj -  kraj -  kral -  proto-germanic * karlaz ( `` free man '' ) [ see churl , krajan ] , * karilaz ( `` man , elder '' ) ( slavs did n't have `` kings '' , but something closer to `` elders '' -  old high german karal -  karl also : * karilaz -  old english \u010beorl -  middle english churl, 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/krajan - krajan - inhabitant of kraina , compatriot , countryman https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/churl - from old english \u010beorl ( `` a freeman of the lowest class , a churl , a countryman , husbandman , a hero , husband , man , male person , a man of inferior class , peasant , rustic , commoner , layman '' ), 
  ... and the kral ( king ) ruled the kraj/kraina/krajina / \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 ( country , land ) . 
  btw in polish we have another and very special `` kraina '' - raj ( paradise , heaven , eden ) . 
  raj -  kraj -  kral k - in polish is not just a random letter . 
  it means `` to '' . 
  so kraj belongs to raj ( probably king in original meaning ) . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/marchia_wschodnia_ok._1000.svg in red - tribes of western slavs wiped out by germans + old prussians ( real , original , indigenous ) . 
  radogoszcz - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rethra - big cultural center of slavs ... today we even do n't know where it was exactly . 
  [ lech , czech , and rus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech,_czech,_and_rus ), 
  latin alphabet is fucked up , not the slavic languages . 
  most of the old prussians were ** exterminated by the germans ** . 
  a remnant of survivors melted into lithuanians , poles and german colonists . 
  and this is the main reason why central europeans do not feel obligated to host people from former colonies . 
  actually , we were colonies too .

  definitely `` new mixed '' because it 's not a dialect , but rather standard polish with local influences smoothed out due to mixing of people from all around pre-wwii poland .
