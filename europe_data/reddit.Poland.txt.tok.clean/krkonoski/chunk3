  they always `` did n't vote '' . 
  `` nothing changed , everything is fine '' yeah , right . 
  indo-european sympathies lean toward indo-european . 
  simple . 
  yeah ... `` democracy '' as in `` belorussian democracy '' . 
  ex-commies and thieves are in the current government . 
  together with vatican-boot lickers and russian agents . 
   although this government just reverts the changes the predecesor made . 
  why you 're lying ? 
  ______ thx for downvoting . 
  best evidence that polish `` patriots '' are afraid of truth . 
  so you admit that their families are safe and they are n't refugees at all . 
  mistaken body parts ( which definitely would happen ) . 
  they want to create a new scandal and gain few points in the polls . 
  we have not enough minerals !,

  with everything , you hypocritical neo-nazi bastard . 
   pure , shameless propaganda . 
  thank you for your self-criticism . 
   i thought czechs are the most reasonable slavs in the world . 
  they are reasonable when they say that zaolzie can not be returned to po ... uhmmm ... crimea to ukraine . 
  probably because of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pzl_w-3_sok%c3%b3%c5%82 ) . 
   i thought most of them were from arround greece that 's correct . 
  i was talking about a part of mythology common for indo-europeans . 
  we ( slavs ) have a thunder-god too and this slavic `` medieval '' god is as old , as dzeus . 
  if not older . 
  \\* hugs \\* \\* pours vodka \\* in fact finns are hard core ne europeans with some minor uralic ancestry . 
  and you 're not so alone . 
  it 's possible that ie , uralic and some siberian along with native american languages have common ancestry . 
  if scythians were really an iranian tribe , then they did a tournee around asia before settling back around ukraine . 
  so there was a lot of interactions/mixing with other cultures and people and no continuity . 
   why do you keep bringing dna up ? 
  just change the `` dna '' to `` people '' . 
   there are living non-ie-speaking people today in northeast europe that have far more pie ( or pie-like , at least ) ancestry than the 13th century bc scribes writing those linear b tablets likely did . 
  but someone brought this language to greece . 
  we just need to find out who . 
   the early proto-greeks who came down to greece ( 17th century bc or before ) via the balkans were still very steppic in ancestry most likely , anyway , so you 'd have already somewhat differentiated languages being carried by people with very similar ancestry , who did not make as much of a genetic impact in more populated and/or distant areas ( though almost all of europe has some ancestry carried by those migrations , obviously ) , so dna would probably not help much . 
  it depends what we will find in the samples . 
  it 's possible that dna will be just a `` generic yamna '' and it wo n't tell anything new about origin of proto greeks , but if we will find some young and rare clades of e.g. 
  y-dna it will be the opposite . 
  and not necessarily the language was differentiated at this stage . 
  it 's possible that proto greek emerged in situ after migration . 
   pre-proto-germanic if r1a folks from corded ware indoeuropeanized local people in scandinavia and thats the origin of germanic languages then this is possible ( we do n't know exact clades ) . 
   pre-proto-greek we will see . 
  dna is on the way . 
   calling them `` pre-proto-slavs '' is meaningless not exactly . 
  in case of balto-slavs i can say this with a very high degree of certainty . 
  in other cases - it depends . 
   they 're at least both centum languages . 
  which does n't mean anything as you should znow . 
   if they actually spoke some predecessor to tocharian that 's why i wrote `` tarim mummies '' and not `` tocharians '' . 
  my bet is that tocharian was a language of andronovo . 
   unrelated stuff ( e.g. 
  genetics genetics is a crucial stuff here . 
  few years ago tarim mummies were noble ancient celts . 
  both linguists and historians were sure of this and then ... surprise - `` just '' some pre proto slavs ( iirc they are not piir . 
  but another wave from europe ) . 
   you seem to have confused i did n't confuse anything . 
  just simply no one ( from ie speakers ) is closer to pie homeland than slavs . 
   under a steppe pie scenario currently there are no other scenarios . 
  anatolian hypothesis is dead . 
   even more recent separation from baltic not everyone agrees with the existence of balto-slavic branch , but yes , it 's quite probable . 
  if the separation is `` recent '' we just do n't know . 
   proto-slavic is likely not as old as that yes and no . 
  all languages ( maybe excluding creoles ) are equally old . 
  proto-slavic separated into different slavic languages recently , but it does n't mean that it did n't existed two , tree or even four thousand years ago . 
  it 's like saying that latin is young , because romance languages also separated recently . 
   and certainly not \\  4500 i think that there are two options . 
  balto-slavic separated ~ 4500 years ago or ... this separation never happened , and balto-slavic forms a continuum with pie ( simply it is very-late-pie ) . 
  why 4500 ? 
  because of indo-iranians ( or rather supposed proto indo-iranians from sintashta ) . 
  just dive into genetic stuff and you 'll see . 
   its likely urheimat also does n't exactly occupy the same space as yamnaya ( an area much of which seems to have been the domain of various iranic and turkic speaking steppe groups at the beginning of the documented early slavic expansion ) iranians do n't come from yamnaya , but rather from corded ware . 
  sintashta people have quite a big chunk of western european ancestry , and they are most similar to ne poles , w belorussians , se lithuanians and some scandinavians from sweden and norway . 
  so in fact slavs are equally close to the pie homeland . 
  and there is also a forest steppe zone ... and when it comes to greece ... http://www.ancientpages.com/2015/09/15/zyndrams-hill-oldest-known-stone-wall-a-masterpiece-of-architecture-discovered-in-poland/ there is an error in translation - not 12 , but 200 people . 
  also since last month the part about inhabitants being from around hungary is not valid . 
  closest wall like this is somewhere in croatia . 
  but this is still valid :  among earlier findings made in the area of ` zyndram 's hill ' is a stylized human figurine -- so-called violin idol that resembles statuettes usually found in the northern balkans and mycenaean greece . 
   `` this direction contacts of at least some of the prehistoric inhabitants of ` zyndram 's hill ' has already been indicated by previously discovered fragment of a stylized human figurine -- so-called violin idol . 
  such statuettes were produced in large amounts in mycenaean greece , and northern balkans '' -- he added . 
  the best part is that this settlement predates mycenaeans in greece . 
  your myths ( indo-european part ) and language come from around the ukrainian steppe . 
  guess who lives there since at least 4500 years . 
  ancient greece is not so ancient as you think . 
   other than remove women 's freedom http://i.imgur.com/mbctdxo.jpg, 
   i have the most trouble with some of those really old polish geographical names . 
  names like `` wda '' ( a river ) and `` wkra '' if so , than you have a problem with speaking polish in general . 
  there is nothing unusual in these names . 
  it have nothing to do with russians . 
  pis buy votes ( literary , for cash and privileges ) and creates own sa nsdap . 
  the single has already leaked on the internet !, 
  hot !, 
   the germans have no defense against such attacks [ no one have ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienp4j3pw7u ), 
  there was no `` relationship '' , they just worked in the same place . 
  you know where place of germans is ? 
  behind the \u0141aba river . 
  at least .
