  and communist party had over 20 % support in france when ussr was planning to invade western europe . 
  that does n't change the fact , that mainstream politics choosed alliance with us to cotradict that threat . 
  geography is the main factor determining political decisions and that 's why you wo n't find to much attention about the ukrainian war in spain and that 's why poland , sweden or the baltics have different opinion about russia than germany or france . 
  i did n't downvote . 
  and please ... stop whining , it 's pathetic . 
  stop crying about downvotes , you 're being pathetic by doing that . 
  geopolitics . 
  look where did russian influence reached back then and where does it reach now . 
  western europe is not endangered by russia today . 
  it was endangered in soviet times when russia was a superpower that had already half of the continent under control . 
  is n't it to close to britain ? 
  i know i would n't argue about that becouse it 's not important how someone else sees this music . 
  those genre names are just landmarks on the music map helping with orientantion . 
  for someone that 's not into metal , calling it heavy metal is much more helpful than calling it death metal as such person would n't know what this term even means . 
  arguing about in which drawer some musician is ment to be cataloged is childlish . 
  well , personally i 'm aware that it 's not the only face of britain , it 's ignorant not to see how rich that culture is . 
  it 's just the face of britain seen quite often on the cracow market square ... and in the news lately that 's dominating mass imagination right now . 
  i follow statistics , not media bias so it 's not an argument to me but certainly uk has a very , very bad press right now in poland . 
  i meet more and more people for whom ** ` british ' means chauvinist ** , white-trash or something primitive while as 10 years ago , the first thought a pole had when hearing ` british ' was the queen , something royal , mr bean or monty python . 
  i 'm very surprised how fast it 's changing . 
  yes he can , and what are you like 15 ? 
  yep . 
  to know and to believe are two different things . 
  in ** geo ** political terms of course . 
  if i would consider emigration i 'd also choose germany before uk . 
  the culture is more similiar than british and it 's much closer . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  it 's a very typical stance . 
  the same reason why britain quit and then were against catholicism , napoleon , iii reich or any other attempts to unite the continent , now it 's the eu . 
  it 's geopolitics . 
  becouse uk does n't want to end in situation in which taiwan is . 
  but their people want that . 
  that 's the fuss . 
  being outside of the eu , britain will be doing everything to destroy eu . 
  the goal is to replace nato with eu army . 
  betrayal ... both sides knew not to trust eatch other . 
  idiots like these ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6our-l7u8 it 's probably a joke becouse i ca n't believe this guy but this is the image of uk around here that people get from the media after news like that nowdays ... 
  religions are not fucked up equally . 
  uk does n't know what hard lesson even means . 
  becouse the tribute was too low . 
  and that 's what may had in mind . 
  so the remainers voted to stay becouse they knew the leavers from poor areas are going to reach for their money instead eu 's ? 
  i do n't blame brits for anything . 
  i want polish people in uk to feel safe . 
  if police wo n't grant them security then organizing their own protection is the only way to feel safe . 
  is that so hard to understand ? 
  you have no right to judge this , it 's not you , to become a possible victim and yet you want them to become passive victims . 
  that 's totally unfair . 
  people have right to feel safe . 
  i would like the state to provide that security , but if it 's not possible , then i do n't care if you call it a gang , please do . 
  it will make you feel better . 
  no , a thug beats people , i 'm calm like a hindu cow . 
  who said anything about gangs . 
  it 's about organizing themselves in case police is unable to help stop the murders and beatings while you 're suggesting them to be passive victims . 
  it 's unfair and it wo n't happen . 
  and last but no least , it 's not you who 's gon na tell anyone to go home or not . 
  poles gon na stay there , if you like it or not , and if the police wo n't help them , they 're going to defend themselves , if you like it or not . 
  that 's what happens , man , that 's what happens . 
  what has that to do with anything . 
  besides , last time i checked i was n't, 
  i would lie if i 'd say i care if you 're embarrased . 
  mob rule is always the answer in case if there 's no law . 
  it always been this way , that 's why people invented law . 
  i 'd rather wait and see if there 's no if . 
  answered that already, 
  maybe the crime rate in poland is lower than in uk , but remember that among the ones emigrating there 's an overrepresentation of underclass . 
  there 's a lot of poles in british prisons . 
  i 'm talking about normal poles that are victims of chauvinism . 
  glad to hear , if you want to learn more , feel free to ask . 
  answered that already . 
  answered that already . 
  thanks for the good word , i appreciate , but you missed my `` if ... ''  . 
  yeah , i know that . 
  that does n't change the fact that they can be dangerous . 
  not answering to ad hominem , sorry . 
  if you ca n't respect someone with a different opinion , i do n't respect you , so get out of my face . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm just saying that the opinion about great britain is changing in poland , that 's just an unfriendly place to live and be . 
  not , that my personal opinion has changed . 
  if you ask me , it 's just the further a pendulum swings to one side , the further it swings back . 
  i fear that after decades of propagating extreme tolerantionism , we 'll end with extreme racism and ethnic tensions on regular basis in europe . 
  with every month i 'm getting more and more sure about that . 
  no , not as neozazis . 
  for showing those chavs very clearly and emphatically ( to put it nicely ) that beating a pole is a bad idea so they can reflect twice in the future  . 
  if the police ca n't protect the poles , they should protect themselves . 
  there is absolutely no doubt about that . 
  oh no , not there . 
  here ... 
   russia should manipulate japanese politics by offering the kuril islands to japan and provoking anti-americanism is of happening i wonder why has he so much wanted to annex finland , while as balts and poland are to given ` special ' status in the ` eurasian sphere ' but at the same time , kaliningrad and estonia is ment to be controlled by germany . 
  it seems a crazy geopolitical spaghetti to me . 
  poles in uk should start to organize themselves . 
  i 'm shocked how fast is the opinion about great britain changing around here . 
  poles can be very emotional . 
  and the current first lady has a jewish dad  a fact well known during the elections and which did n't change anyrhing, 
  as refugee ? 
  france will be pretending , that it did n't know it was a trick , where as in fact it 's gon na be `` fuck crimea ( and fuck ukraine , baltics ... ) , we 've got business to do '' . 
  i 'm not talking about the state but ordinary people . 
  the thing is that british tourists appeared in much larger numbers after 2004 , interested in cheap booze and cheap hookers but not quite in the country . 
  that 's when the stereotype of the british changed . 
  of course i 'm not saying that normal british did n't visit , but those drunks were very visible at some point and they 've done their job ,
