   france is literally the only state that surrendered so easy . 
  not important . 
   no matter how you interpret elected french officials , they are the legitimate government from before and during the occupation . 
  no , the vichy government and the constitutional change of 1940 was judged illegal . 
  you 're ignoring my posts , not adressing to arguments and only repeating your stuff which i already answered to . 
   a government does n't become illegitimate because people disagree with their actions . 
  never was my argument . 
   sure , they made bad decisions . 
  that 's why france needs to acknowledge responsibility . 
  to make sure these things wo n't happen again . 
  it does n't need to acknowledge responsibility and it does n't work this way . 
   it matters . 
  because they were the elected official government . 
  and then became illegal after constitutional change . 
   you claim it 's the surrender . 
  so it is illegal for a state to surrender when overwhelmed by a military force ? 
  no , i claim it 's the constitutional change of 1940 . 
  it 's then when they accepted that half of france is under nazi rule and half is becoming a puppet nazi german state . 
   your logic is failing . 
  you 're grasping for straws at this point . 
  it is n't , your has fallen long time ago . 
  that 's why you 're ignoring large parts of my posts . 
   i never said civilians did n't take part . 
  you did . 
  you said :  ** citizens did not execute the roundup ** . 
  citizens organized a resistance while the vichy government obbeyed nazi orders . 
  now i see . 
  it 's not that you 're just ignoring arguments of the discutant like the fact that vichy goverment was judged illegal . 
  ** you 're openly lying in the discussion ** and i 've just proven it . 
  you do n't deserve any attention anymore and you should not be treated seriously . 
  you 're pathetic at this point . 
   saying it wo n't make it true . 
  you are getting desperate . 
  it 's you , who was saying that in the first place , but i 'm surprised you 're desperate if you had to lie to prove your point . 
  it did n't help . 
  i think you know that . 
   what alternate reality am i fabricating ? 
  that vichy government was legal . 
   if what you say is true , something happened that made them illegal . 
  and no such thing happened . 
  i wrote one of the reasons in my previous post , but you 've ignored it . 
   why ? 
  because you say so ? 
   you 're behaving like a kindergarten kid . 
  you started it , dear . 
  i 'm adjusting to your retarted level od discussion . 
  i 'm not wrong . 
  you are ! '', 
  it was an answer to your `` argument '' which started this level of discussion . 
  it camed out from you , becouse you 're a desperate little guy who ca n't prove his arguments based on knowledge , who 's openly lying as proven above and who 's not even reading discutant 's posts with understanding . 
   the government did not change when the nazis invaded france . 
  the state did . 
  this is a historic fact . 
   france surrendered and accepted nazi rule . 
  which is n't making vichy , which was n't iii republic anymore any more legal . 
   i 've answered all of your absurd claims . 
  nope , you 're just ignoring some of them and repeating stuff you said and which i 've already answered to . 
   please stop assuming things on my behalf . 
   i 'm not , you 've ended this discussion . 
  it was your decision , not mine . 
  you 're only answering after that becouse you 're an emotional , weak person that ca n't stand about being wrong . 
   your opinion is not a fact , bro . 
  you can not rewrite history . 
  it 's a fact and there 's a general consensus among historians that vichy was a german puppet ( client ) state . 
  i 'm not rewriting history , you are . 
   he was granted power by the elected president . 
  in iii republic . 
  we 're talking about vichy where he was granted dictatorship powers , changing the system and state itself into the vichy france and this constitutional change was judged as illegal and annulled with the law of 9 august 1944 that declared it null and void ( you seem to missed this part ) . 
  one of the reasons was that albert lebrun did n't legally approved that constitutional change . 
  you 're ignoring historic facts . 
  but you ca n't spin this as you 'd like . 
  history and facts are against you . 
  no , history and facts are against you . 
  you 're ignoring historic facts . 
   there is no `` alternate '' france as you claim . 
  i do n't claim that , but current french state is a legal continuation of iv republic which is a legal continuation of iii republic where as vichy state period was judged as illegal and annulled with the law of 9 august 1944 that declared it null and void . 
  you 're not arguing with me on this , but with french lawyers which reasoning i find reasonable . 
   elected officials did n't become nazis over night as you claim . 
  will you start reading my posts finally ? 
  i 'm not talking about personal responsibility , but level-state responsibility . 
  it does n't matter when they started being nazis , what matter is that vichy state was n't a legal continuation of french sovereign state and even if it was , it did n't control the territory where the discussed events took place . 
   you are fabricating an alternate reality just so you can get away with ignoring the jew roundup and deportation to death camps . 
  i 'm not ignoring the jewish roundup , i even teached you a lesson about it ( you thought civilisans did n't took part in it ) , so this is an absurd , but not surprising statement coming from you . 
  it 's you , who is urgnet about fabricating an alternate reality . 
   and it 's not working . 
  facts and history are against you . 
  no , facts and history are against you . 
   it does n't matter . 
  what matters is that the french government did those things . 
  it was n't a legal french government becouse it was n't a legal continuation of a sovereign french state and people who run it were even accused of treason . 
   call it whatever you like . 
  these are the facts . 
  no , you call it whatever you like . 
  these are the facts . 
   this discussion is over . 
  and you lost it , not being able to answer my arguments for like 3 posts and finally giving up as you should . 
   this is my point . 
  that the french government surrendered and accepted nazi rule . 
  which makes it a nazi-german puppet state from that very moment , not a sovereign french state which iii republic was and of which iv republic was a continuation . 
   this is the same government that was elected by the french people .
