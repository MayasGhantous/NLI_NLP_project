  article mentions other social groups which are n't based on their skin colour who he also sees as problematic with different reasons . 
  having that in mind , i do n't see him being racist . 
  he 's rather a ` collective responsibility ' type of guy towards all sort of social groups that can be problematic with different reasons . 
  i do n't support collective responsibility , when i need to make quick decisions but if it works for him then i 'm fine with it . 
  this is really a common practise . 
  i see a lot of renting ads where the owner is open about the preffered sex of the person seeking for a room to be female . 
  why ? 
  becouse females are generally seen as less problematic when renting a room and more caring about the tidiness . 
  i do n't see any reason why cultural background of a person should be more controversial than this . 
  ** should i name all those female-prefering owners as sexist pricks ? 
  ** no , i understand why they prefer females , the same way i understand why this guy preferes ` not-coloured ' people . 
  i ca n't blame him or them for choosing the ` fast and easy ' solution , nobody 's being harmed here , some just do n't get to do business with him , but at the same time he does n't get to do business with them , including those who are n't leaving a smelly room behind . 
  that 's pretty much it , no need to raise a shitshow about this . 
  ** nobody 's giving him the chance so i will ** . 
  you 're all critisizing him for his rhetorics or becouse of his weight , which is primitive and childish . 
  you probably are intelligent to know , that it 's not just about curry . 
  maybe those `` coloured people '' are more messy and problematic on average than others and that 's why he does n't want them ? 
  maybe they do generate more costs ? 
  not even bother to glance at the issue , do n't you ? 
  if this is the case , which he sees as proven , ** then i can understand his decision ** . 
  however , with this collective responsibility he might lost a lot of business becouse we all know that ( even if on average it 's true ) there are plenty of coloured people who are n't messy . 
  if collective responsibility is worth it in this case then there are two options : `` coloured people '' really are more messy or he 's making an error on his estimations . 
  but tbh , the fact that he was long-term succesful in his business is making me rather hard to believe in the second option . 
  im strucked each time i see how many russians are following this stupid narrative . 
  is n't he considered to be just putin 's puppet ? 
  the good cop in the duet , but not really an independent political figure ? 
  if the opposition sees him this way , then hating medvedev is a natual and logical consequence , nothing to be surprised about . 
  but we wo n't stop giving terror attacks attention , they 're too spectacular . 
  the attention that authorities are giving for preventing terror attacks is n't about the scale of death terror attacks cause , but about political implication of those acts . 
  the attention given to car accidents is becouse of those deaths as it 's still a noticeable number . 
  however , a number which in we is imho small enough to make it not deserving the attention it has . 
  we should focus much more on cancer and heart deseases which are even far less spectacular than car accidents but cause far more deaths . 
  the number of car accident deaths is going to fall anyway as there are more safe cars on streets and as road conditions improve , this dynamic is already working . 
  that 's becouse you 're wrongly assuming that importance of terror should be measured in dead bodies which is wrong , becouse the targets of terror are n't the dead ones , but ones sitting in front of tv . 
  those few dead bodies are a small loss in scale of a country . 
  the political change that a terror attack can cause is far more important . 
  and that 's why it 's nonsese to put terror attacks as an example here for comparsion . 
  which part is problematic to you ? 
  the political tension has also decreased compared to 2016 . 
  so that 's why basketball is so popular in lithuania . 
  why should a terror attack be a benchmark here ? 
  victims of terror attacks were never really big , death is not the point of a terror attack . 
  and no , transport ( not only car ) accidents are responsible for a small percentage of deaths : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:causes_of_death_%e2%80%94_standardised_death_rate,_2013.png and falling : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:causes_of_death_%e2%80%94_standardised_death_rate_per_100_000_inhabitants,_men,_eu-28,_2004%e2%80%9313.png it really is n't a major issue today and a lot is being done already as cars on streets are getting newer and road conditions are getting better . 
  the number of fatalities is gradually falling and it 's really low compared to what it used to be or compared to third world countries . 
  this issue is n't really big today in western europe . 
  cars in the last decade or two have really become safer so as time passes , the number of fatalities will continue to drop . 
  in my opinion , turkey is having a chance to build even stronger empire than before . 
  their population is peaking while the population of south-eastern europe is falling . 
  most of their middle eastern neighbours are a mess . 
  and their nationalistic government got rid off people who follow anything else but islam 100 years ago . 
  and islam itself , now completely dominating in turkey ( which was n't the case in ottoman times ) is a good ideology to conquer and expand . 
  istanbul aglomeration itself is having almost the population of greece now . 
  in my opinion turkey is only going to grow . 
  everyone knows who these people are . 
  and who let them in ? 
  sweden . 
  that 's how most of the world , europe included , was marrying most of the time and yet , here we are . 
  i 'm banned there too becouse i 've pointed that if russia wo n't change , people in russia will start rioting in few years ahead and this might end with a disaster for russia . 
  but in was at the peak of the nationalistic amuck after crimea annexation . 
  it 's common knowledge that roma are begging not becouse they have to , but becouse they choose to as their shitty culture does n't value work at all , so they 're not interested in getting a normal job . 
  why are people giving them money then ? 
  the dead ones are n't really the targets of terrorism . 
  those in front of tv are . 
  that 's why number of deaths is n't that important , this is a tiny loss in context of the whole society . 
  what matters is the political change , that the act of terror provides after the public opinion changes it 's opinion . 
  some did , they started developing in xviii century , but austrian nationality is basically a post ww2 thing . 
  u.s. does n't have a large rural population . 
  also in turkey over 70 % are living in cities . 
  becouse western countries treat islam like just another religon , ignoring the fact that 's also a political ideology like nazism or liberalism . 
  offtopic : what 's with ukrainians waving flags anyway ? 
  i often see them waving flags in our cities , often but not always in tourist spots , for example in cracow . 
  not that i have something agaisnt it , it 's just that i did n't see anyone else doing it and cracow is no mt. 
  everest  . 
  the napoleonic wars was the first time when the world war in europe schema occured . 
  the dominant sea empire had to fight along with the dominant land empire against the growing hybrid empire in europe . 
   why ? 
  becouse i do n't consider russia being a power with capabilities and political position that would make this move reasonable or even possible . 
  russia is n't capable to even succesfully invade and take over georgia or ukraine , not to mention nato pact . 
  this is fantasy . 
  i see it as a crumbling post-imperial state that has more bark than bite and which will have more and more troubles with separatist movements in the future . 
  but notice , that i do n't wish russia to implode , as it would have very negative economic consequences for cee , destabilisation of russia is n't anything good . 
  i just think it will happen , becouse on almost every economic or social field russia is doing quite badly . 
  if it goes for the way the society is shaped , murder , suicide , alcoholism , drug use , violence , other criminals rates , divorce rates , population changes are very high in russia , it means that their society is very demoralised compared to russian neghbours . 
  no to mention corruption which is something normal in russia and most russians does n't even see that fighting corruption is essential to keep the state working in the long run . 
  for russians corruption is a part of how their state works . 
  if it goes for economy , ussr was the second world economy , today russian gdp is smaller that italian . 
  they do n't produce anything aside weapons that somebody would want to buy , so their economy is backwarded , based mostly on selling raw materials , oil , gas , minerals . 
  this is a disaster becouse it works only as long as prosperity on oil and gas markets is present . 
  and no prosperity stays forever . 
  russia lost 2 decades on being a gas station instead of reforming their economy towards a modern free market , innovative economy that would work even is there 's no prosperity on oil and gas markets . 
  polish levels of innovation suck but russia , despite having 4 times more people is having our levels of new innovations each year after decades of being on the scientific top in ussr times . 
  and where is all the money from oil and gas going ? 
  to oligarchs , which spend a big chunk of that money abroad buying prosperity in england or other places . 
  ca n't really blame them that they want to live elsewhere but an average russian does n't see much of that money . 
  http://i.imgur.com/yu4qi4k.png the disproportion of wealth in russia is enormous , which is n't a good indicator for the future , it rather suggests unrest in the nearest future . 
  i just ca n't see any way for russia to get out of this dynamic of events which ends badly for them , and i 'm far from being happy about it , furthermore , that 's why i do n't want my country to get involved in the east . 
  not true , in 1939 russia was recognized as a superpower . 
  it had the biggest army in the world and profited largely from grabbed property , selling resources . 
  also , russia controlled much bigger territory containing numerous resources in central asia and eastern europe . 
  also , population numbers for russia were much more favorable .
