  you should go allahu akbar mode against them , otherwise you 'll end with kleptocracy back again and it does n't matter if you think that you do n't deserve it . 
  russians are the biggest loosers of putin decisions ( maybe except ukrainians ) , however they still think he 's some kind of defender of russia . 
  they have a strong allergic reaction when they hear the truth , that they are , in fact , constantly being fucked hard by their government and president . 
  russians have developed a kind of slave mentality that makes them stand behind their government no matter what this government is doing to them and they always believe that their problems are western fault . 
  dunno , maybe they 're so depressed and used to it since forever , that they do n't even feel and notice that something is being constantly taken away from them . 
  i 'm pretty sure , that many russians think that declaiming such views about their society is trying to make them harm . 
  how does it feel to be so wrooooooooooooooooooooong ? 
  and do you know when companies started to develop self-parking ? 
  in mid 90 's . 
  it 's 2017 and still the vast majority of cars that you see on the streets are not having it . 
  do you see how much time it took and takes ? 
  we 're talking about a fully automated , full-fledged car . 
  it 's then when the job shift will happen . 
  a fully automated , full-fledged car is far from being even exclusive right now . 
  we 're going to have to wait a pretty big while for that , but yeah , when that happens , then things will start going very fast . 
  we do n't hate russians , at least not me . 
  and for your question , yes , language is making a whole lot of difference . 
  while being a pole , it 's much easier to understand a person speaking ukrainian that russian without knowing those languages . 
  even with a czech person it 's not that easy as when talking with a ukranian . 
  i , for example knew we 're going to be somwhere around here . 
  it 's a relative measure . 
  no , it 's not common sense . 
  it 's just nothing . 
  the development wo n't end in few years , as a matter of fact , it will be far from the end . 
  probably in some stable politically place that 's offering good conditions for business . 
  tbh , i never heard a bad thing about ukrainians working in poland . 
  the only thing i could say is that a big part of the males among them are looking devastated , probably becouse alcoholism , but this desease itself is n't a reason not to like someone . 
  then start believing , becouse that 's what happens , man , that 's what happens . 
  i like being arrogant , deal with it ( alone ! ), 
  or leave . 
  and i 'm not shooting myself . 
  i 'm glad that we do n't have lw\u00f3w anymore and the reasons are rational , it 's better for me if poland stays away from that mess . 
  we should focus on integrating with the west and leave ukraine to ukrainians , instead our stupid government is sending them money each year , nobody knows what for given the scale of corruption around there . 
  our experts are hired by ukrainian government to help them getting their shit together . 
  i want those people here helping getting our shit together , but our stupid government wo n't hire anyone from ` the other side ' of the political spectrum . 
  lol , this is n't a real business analysis . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
  glad that we do n't have lw\u00f3w anymore . 
  there 's no interest in expanding into notoriously chaotic and poor east . 
  no income , only trouble . 
  it 's better to have a peaceful life . 
  tbh , i thought russia 's more important to germany as an export partner than this . 
  it 's not even in the top10 . 
  i know that . 
  still , you overestimate the amount of profit this could cause and so overestimate the speed at which corporations will push for it if you think it will happen that fast . 
  i agree . 
  you overestimate the amount of profit this could cause and so overestimate the speed at which corporations will push for it . 
  i predicted in 2002 that we 're going to be somwhere around where we are today when it comes to technology . 
  i know that automation is the future , just not that close future , these things are n't going en masse that fast , there 's a lot of crawling to do in the beginning . 
  exactly . 
  30 % of automated trucks in us in 15 years is the extremely positive scenario . 
  it wo n't even happen in uk/us in 15 years . 
  :d . ok , so my claim is that globally at least 70 % of trucks in 15 years wo n't be automated . 
  let 's make a bet . 
  wan na bet that in 15 year time there 's still going to be plenty of truck drivers ? 
  it 's strange . 
  i can clearly see what finland can benefit from further integration given your geopolitical situation . 
  nordic federalists or eu federalists ? 
  it does . 
  there ca n't be a dictator if there 's still a democracy . 
  it 's contradictory . 
  no , you do n't stand by it . 
  if you 're saying that there is democracy in poland ( for now ... ) that means we do n't have a dictator . 
  that would be a logical fallacy . 
   so , 37 % of the popular vote means you should be above the law ? 
  no it means that saying that democracy in poland is over becouse of that is an exaggeration . 
   i do n't think you know what democracy is . 
  i do n't think you know what democracy is . 
   also , they 're not done dismantling it yet so , there is democracy in poland . 
  just like i said at the beginning . 
  so what 's the fuss . 
  they wo n't dismantle it becouse they do n't have the power to do it , pis is too ineffectual to do it . 
   the fact that anybody is elected democratically does not necessarily make them them democratic rulers . 
  that was n't my argument . 
   we now have a tin-pot dictator . 
  no , we do n't . 
  that 's a silly exaggeration . 
  i do n't think that pis will improve anything , quite the opposite , it will lower the quaility of life in poland . 
  i 'm just saying that an opinion that pis destroyed democracy in poland just becouse they 've broke the law in few places is a huge emotional exaggeration . 
  but now , after calling me a pis cronie , which in fact , it 's a primitive ad hominem argumentation , i 'm pretty sure why are you falling for it . 
  where is new testament endorsing slavery ? 
  violating the constitution doens ' t mean that democracy magically ends at that moment . 
  it 's a far more complex mechanism that still functions and pis does n't have the power to remove it . 
  according to your logic , the law does n't exist becouse someone commited a crime . 
  no , it does n't work that way . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it 's a primitve term that never should have been used . 
  if you like it , and to my consternation , you 're using it to explain why other people think this way , then you 're a deceitful person , just like many people on ` the other side ' , who ca n't handle truth and that 's why you 're reaching for these exaggerations . 
  to get an easy anwer and counter theirs . 
  are you saying that he is autocratic ? 
  then you are delusional . 
  democracy is still there . 
  what a primitive straw man , you 've got there . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  how come ? 
  ** what are these people ** ( rydzyk , jerzy wi\u0119cek , adam kalina , antoni dydycz ) ** saying about refugees that contradicts what pope said ** ? 
  i 'm not counting miedlar becouse he 's not a priest anymore , so it 's unfair to put him as an example a.d. 2017 . 
  if anything , he 's an example that church is pushing away priests that are cutting ties with popes message . 
  so , generally you 're supporting what i 've said . 
  great .
