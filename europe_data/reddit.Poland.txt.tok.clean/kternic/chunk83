  with no-boundaries free-speech you have no way of protecting yourself from this . 
  free speech comes with limits that protect not only ` big institutions ' but also ordinary people , thankfully . 
  and blue baloons, 
  not true , you can compare them and in both cases you can sue them by the same law if you feel insulted . 
  it 's not comparing apples and oranges as you like think it is . 
  on these levels , when it comes to insults , the news media as well as the humouristic magazine have similiar responsibilities and both can be ( becouse of that ) sued by the same reasons . 
  so you do n't seem to understand that these differences does n't matter here , where a certain limit has been crossed . 
  i do n't agree with that at all . 
  there 's always someone who 's not satisfied with someone or hates something . 
  people would have to be machines to equally hate/love something and this wo n't ever happen . 
  that 's why we have those laws . 
  for someone 's macron doing a good job , someone else would gladly say `` fuck you '' to him . 
  for someone trump 's doing the right job but someone else decided to say `` fuck you '' to him . 
  this is n't a debate based on argumentation , it 's telling the readers what should they think about trump or macron based on emotional , not rational argumentation and therefore this is n't press worth reading . 
   you 're from poland like me , would n't you say that ` fuck ' is actually a semi-acceptable word here ? 
  everyday language and press language are not the same thing . 
  i 'm not going to comment on the language you 're using when talking with your mother , well , i was n't kurwing to mine . 
  in this context it does n't matter at all if trump was right or wrong . 
  besides , it 's still a worldview , if a worldview does n't correspond with scientific facts it still not a reason to be disrespectful to someone . 
  a respectful source of information should not break it 's content levels depending on if author ( or his readers ) agrees with someone or not . 
  it 's an ugly double standard practise and normal people should n't tolerate something like that in their newspapers . 
  this newspaper from berlin and those british tabloids chosen freely to be what they are . 
  there are polish examples as well , like gazeta polska dressing tusk or tomasz lis in a nazi uniform . 
  i know , but brexit gave a momentum to it now , like diana 's death some 20 years ago . 
  i do n't think you should n't be able insult a president like that . 
  i just think a newspaper that does that is on the same level as these british tabloids . 
  i see a difference here but it does n't change the fact that it 's the same level of nonsensce , just different thematics . 
  i expect from satirical , tabloid and normal newspapers to keep some level of content . 
  you could also say that `` well , the sun is just not for me '' as you referred to charlie ebdo . 
  they 're just both low , and if the form is intended to be low , it does n't change much to me . 
  it 's only fitting for you becouse it fits your worldview . 
  it 's the only difference . 
  it 's below any levels i except from a normal , non-tabloid newspaper . 
  seems like a good way to create jobs / s. 
  so britain under this corbyn guy is going to be back to the times when pink floyd had to leave the country ? 
  it seems like he wants to repeat hollande mistakes on taxing the fuckery out of businesses . 
  when will people learn that when you tax a business , for example , camel selling with 10 % , then the camel selling company will just raise prices of their camels about 10 % and the higher tax is being paid by customers ? 
  i thought british press is worse than others , but lately i 've seen a german newspaper berliner kurier saying `` fuck you ! '', 
  on it 's cover , adressed to trump . 
  https://twitter.com/per_bike_berlin/status/870253855212285953/photo/1 not to mention some of our tabloids or right-wing covers , and i 'm not a fan of charlie hebdo either , i think it 's primitive . 
  so i now think that bad press is pretty much the same everywhere and british is n't particulary more bad than others . 
  it 's just in vogue to hate british press becouse the brexit , it 's not in vogue to hate charlie hebdo becouse they were shot , it 's not in vogue to hate primitive trump slaming becouse it 's in vogue to hate trump . 
  but it 's quite the same . 
  sounds like polish . 
  czech would be something like pstrtscna, 
  we should look at this as an attempt to make two-speed europe . 
  from our perspective comission actions seem crazy and irrational , but when you think about two speed europe plan , there is a reason to do it , actually . 
  your knowledge is pathetic becouse you do n't even know about things like gini index which is the basic measure of inequality in econometry . 
  cheers !, 
  how would i answer to someone spitting nonsense about `` being slaves ( rotfl , yes , he said slaves ) of corporations '' . 
  it 's was much more complex than that . 
  true , a part of polish tatars settled as political refugees , many of those with aristoctratic background and this was one major group . 
  another big group were tatars taken in captivity and later released to settle . 
  but it 's false that they all just peacefully integrated with the society since then . 
  some tatars served in polish army , but some took the mehmed iv side in later wars and acted against poland in wars with turkey . 
  it was later on , when these things cleared up . 
  russia is far from ubercapitalism . 
  the main condition is n't respected - rule of law . 
   it would be so awesome . 
  there are other countries in europe you know where life is good . 
  countries with societies that do n't fetishize social benefits and working rights but just put them on rational levels . 
  for example - germany and if i had to choose , i rather live there . 
  the economy is better and average working time is n't high at all  . 
   i 'm just replying on your level . 
  no , you 're way below my level . 
  you did n't provide any argumentation at all . 
  i 'm suprised about myself that i even responded to such trash content . 
   wealth inequality in french society ( growing ) gini index in france is close to european average and european average is one the highest in the world . 
  the most equal contries in europe are countries like germany which cut benefits when they could n't afford them on previous levels anymore . 
  ask yourself why , but since you shown your utterly pathetic level of knowledge already i doubt that you find any real answers . 
  rotfl , this is a typical left-wing primitive rhetoric that does n't even consist any real content and argumentation . 
  just emotional garbage . 
  this is obviously not true and it 's easy to prove it by the fact that the world is n't dominated by countries with no working rights at all and those do n't even exist . 
  but even if the state wants to be very generous and therefore sacrifice some growth for a welfare state it should n't be generous above the levels it can afford while still being competetive . 
  and this value of benefits is n't constant . 
  sometimes you can add some , sometimes you have to cut them . 
  germany has cut benefits when it got to a point when germany could not afford them at those levels and keep up it 's economy on the track . 
  this was a completely rational and good decision and that 's what needed to be done in france , the sooner the better . 
  nobody 's saying about racing to the bottom . 
   oversized in whose mind in a mind of every rational human being that realises that oversized working rights and benefits are harmful for the economy and workers as well , epsecially when the state ca n't afford that longer . 
  you did n't really cotradict what i 've said . 
  this allergry to reforms you speak about is really dangerous considering the fact that people like le pen are now becoming the voice of the `` give me more for free '' electorate . 
  i just have a feeling that many of those voices praising macron on / r/europe will regret it just when i 'm going to start appreciate him for what he 's doing for french economy and therefore , for the eu . 
  fetish for ** oversized ** benefits and ** oversized ** ( is n't it nice to manipulate someone 's words like that ? ), 
  working rights is such a bad thing ~ ~ / s ~ ~ if you care about your economy . 
  why kill . 
  it 's quite funny ... for a german . 
  i agree . 
  french have some kind of odd fetish for socialism , oversized social benefits , oversized working rights , lack of market flexibility and so on and the large chunk of this is what macron has to take away if the french economy wants to get back on track longterm . 
  i said it few months ago , he might end as popular as hollande if he really decides to reform france . 
  when tatars came to plc lands , they also did n't want to integrate and were far from being calm . 
  may i remind you that they came here along with the golden horde armies . 
  then some of them took pro-polish sides in later centuries . 
  they are calm and integrated now , becouse there 's not many of them and they are highly influenced by local culture instead of their own . 
  no , becouse even most of pis electorate is pro-eu . 
  anti-eu electorate in poland is 20-30 % , it 's the far-right , alternative-right and the pis core and these people will never vote for po or any other liberals or christian-democrats . 
  it 's rather to early do judge if french liberals are competent and energetic . 
  does it differ much though ? 
  muslims in western europe were also calm when they were small in numbers . 
  that 's exactly the kind of attitude that makes germany in charge , not france .
