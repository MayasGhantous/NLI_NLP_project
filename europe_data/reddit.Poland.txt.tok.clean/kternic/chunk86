  rotfl . 
  what were the governments thinking . 
  how come a 15 year old 15 years ago knew that this will start happening , and grown-ups had no idea . 
  pinochet invaded chile 's neighbours ? 
  it was three poles that defeated the soviet union , wa\u0142\u0119sa , wojty\u0142a , brzezi\u0144ski , with a little help of reagan . 
  maybe , however i doubt he intended a joke there . 
  where would be the funny part ? 
  wow , you really missed that one . 
  never heard of it ! '', 
  well , i did n't say that those ties are completely cut off , but that they are n't so tight as they used to be still in the 60 's . 
  i wanted to point out the general trend as canada is moving towards building it 's own identity . 
  american influence and being open to mass immigration from non-uk countries is accelerating this process but it cannnot be stopped as it 's rooted mainly in the different geographic context . 
  and when it comes to monarchy i based on : http://globalnews.ca/news/3145545/majority-of-canadians-say-ties-to-monarchy-should-be-cut-when-queen-dies-poll/, 
  there 's something about her that reminds me our pm kopacz , who drowned po . 
  lack of self-confidence maybe . 
  better not , it causes deseases https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome, 
  some parts of canadian political class are seeking a way to balance us influence upon them . 
  us generally took over the influence in anglosphere . 
  uk can join , but it ca n't lead . 
  canadians in the 60 's were still feeling a lot british , but now it 's the us cultural influence that 's shaping that nation . 
  i read an article about post ww2 canadians and many of them did n't like this cutting ties with britain , for example the flag change caused an outrage in many parts of the country . 
  today many canadians say that for them those ties that are left , like sharing the head of the state is more like a burden and this process will probably continue as canada is filling up with people that do n't have any connections with uk . 
  after leaving eu , supporting us internationally and creating the anglosphere , but with us leadership is probably the best that uk could do now , until the cultural ties will slacken and it 's too late . 
  man , this is just some webpage . 
  who cares . 
  hopefully . 
  yes , and ? 
  the question was why is he disliked in poland/baltics . 
  he caused these problems for us . 
  why would we start disliking him becouse of his problems ? 
  absurd . 
  all these discussions can be summarized as : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmjxvsclu6s, 
  liberals should stop referring to second half xx century memes ( the berlin wall ) if they want to be popular among youth . 
  i see us as a good example of a presidential system . 
  i do n't see why it would be `` bad '' . 
  obama abandoned missile defence shield in europe in 2009 and after that he started a policy of ` reset with russia ' which was considered here as naive , especially after georgia war , not to mention crimea , and tbh these comments were right . 
  russia at that time was considered as a growing threat for stability in the region and obama 's policy made us look like it 's leaving us alone . 
  also , people did n't like his middle east policy and were partly blaming him for immigration crisis in europe . 
  in western europe . 
  maybe those who predict are n't rational ? 
  it 's good when pm or president has the leading role , it can be the president like in us , or pm ( chancellor ) , like in germany . 
  it 's bad when these two poses similiar power and influence . 
  and that 's our case today . 
  the only way i see is to prevent it , otherwise it will end up with rising ethnic tensions , like in france or uk that does n't seem to have end anywhere near , or a complete bloodspill like in almost all historical cases . 
  that 's a nice theory , which never worked out really when a demographic shift came . 
  it 's an utopia for naive people and smart countries should n't allow for a massive demographic change if they want to avoid bloodspill . 
  research centres are often disagreeing on russia economic outcome , but they also usually agree that russian economy is still very sensitive on oil and gas prices , it all really depends on that . 
  muslims are not denied from practising islam in israel . 
  there was a lot more discussion on / r/russia before they banned everyone who did n't agree with them . 
  i guess it 's russia in a nutshell . 
  yep , those are small atrocities if you put them in the context of most of ** conflicts ** that are going right now where things like burning people alive in cages took places . 
  besides , you 're not telling the whole truth . 
  otherwise gaza citiziens would be dying out from starving and deseases and that 's not the case . 
  the fact is that israel is allowing help for gaza strip , as a matter of fact , it 's the basis of their poor ( since israel left gaza in 2005 , taking away their companies ) economy . 
  water supply issues happened also becouse israel left gaza . 
  and why ? 
  becouse israel was attacked from gaza , so it 's competely reasonable to block it in such situation - meanwhile you 're openly suggesting that it 's israel fault . 
  they had a ** full ** right to respond with gaza blockade after israeli territory was attacked from there . 
  it 's yet another time when arabs broke the peace with israel and then start yelling after they 've meet with response . 
  you really do n't understand how conflicts work . 
  nonetheless , gaza population is booming . 
  death toll difference - i do n't see a reason why israel should be saying sorry that 's more effective in this ** conflict ** in which both sides are being attacked . 
  absurd . 
  tbh , i thought the difference was wider . 
  when it comes to turkey , it 's one of the main geopolitical laws . 
  the strength of a country is measured in weakness of it 's neighbourhood . 
  most of countries surrounding turkey are failed states , like syria , iraq , liban or just weak states , like georgia , armenia , bulgaria . 
  israel is the biggest power in the region that could balance turkish growing influence in me making it harder to spread influence over levant . 
  however yes , turkey will have to confront iran at some point , we should except a conflict like this in the first half of xxi century , not sure if open war though . 
  okay , then call me a nazi , becouse for me the reasons behind his views are pretty obvious and i do n't care about people like you labeling me anyway . 
  a ) what can i do that you ca n't see that . 
  it 's pretty obvious to me . 
  b ) they do , those reasons are why he was forced to resigned . 
  not becouse he said something . 
  i do , and that 's what matters to me . 
  it was n't needlessly . 
  he stopped trolling . 
  becouse his ethnicity is the reason of his lack of support for nato . 
  he wants the country of his ethnicity origin to have more influence in the country he 's currently living in and nato is making that harder . 
   i would want the entire world to come to their defense if attacked . 
  good to hear . 
   israel has essentially made the two-state solution impossible as of now . 
  new settlements have been any boundaries impractical , and it 's not stopping . 
  at this point , it 's impossible to divide it neatly . 
  it is . 
  just like arabs living in israel , where in northen parts they 're even a majority . 
  but practically now you 're talking that there ca n't be a palestinian state becouse it would have a jewish minority in it ? 
  that 's what i was talking about but you downplayed it . 
  arabs have rights in israel , israelis would n't have in a palestian state as for the shape it would took today . 
   this is a hole israel dug for itself . 
  no , actually it was the arabs that first start the fire and it was almost always the arab-side who broke peace . 
  for example , israel accepted the un borders long time ago , arabs broke that peace so they had to take more land to be able to defend themselves and that 's reasonable , becouse with un borders ( which israel however accepted ) israel was n't even a consistent land mass and during war conditions it would be easy to break communication between various parts of the country . 
  after that and few conflicts more , occupation is the best solution that israel came out with . 
  it 's those arabs who self-caused this on themselves . 
  why should israel allow to loose it 's jewish character . 
  it would be ackward thing to do , the main reason why this state started is becouse they wanted to have a jewish character state . 
  i repeat , israel would be willing to get palestinians their state if the fact of independent palestinian state was n't a threat to israel becouse of their lack of strategic depth . 
  giving them that state now would be completely irresponsible when having israeli citizien safety in mind . 
  if palestians would finally stop attacking israeli citiziens and be willing to live peacfully as neighbours , they would get their state . 
  zionism is n't jewish fanaticism , above all it was an independence movement , similiar to irish , polish or other such movements at given time and jews are n't a hiv-mind like you 're trying to suggest .
