  they 're a nation , like all others - deeply divided . 
  whatever , but why share it with me ? 
  besides , are n't those brits after their fertile years anyway ? 
   no middle ground , eh ? 
  no room for criticism , or they all die ? 
  if your country would be surrounded by enemies making open threats to you , i think you 'd change your perspective from sitting in a cozy chair , far from any danger that you have now . 
  i did n't say criticism of israel is n't allowed , so do n't impute on me things that i did n't say . 
  i said that people who care about israel should support it in general sense . 
  it 's just imho that their astrocities are a small price ** if ** needed for israel to stay as a regional power . 
   palestinians are an occupied people with no rights in israel . 
  the only reasons a group called `` palestinians '' exist is israel . 
  there was no palestinian nation before israel was created , even early israeli wars are called israeli-arab wars , becouse they were pretty much that - arabs . 
  a palestinian nation is being under creation right now , and the main reason is becouse their interaction with the israeli state . 
  it 's not how israel is viewed in the world , but i 'm pretty sure , that if israel is assured that their civilians are safe from arabs attaking them , they would agree on two-state solution in practise . 
  from a military point of view they ca n't allow to give up on any tiny bit of land and that 's becouse something that in military studies is called ` lack of strategic depth ' which makes that israel ca n't allow at any reason to fight a war on their own ground . 
  that means that they wo n't stop controlling palestine as long as there wo n't be any danger emerging from those territories on them . 
  and this is completely reasonable , own citiziens and the existence of the state matter the most . 
   one party is a globally-recognized state and has all the power , and the other party is powerless and does n't even have water . 
  i ca n't think of a situation more one-sided than the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  i meant one-sided as media narrative , where israel is always the bad guy . 
  the fact that it 's stronger ( which imho is good ) does n't mean that it 's israel breaking peace threaties and attacking civilians . 
  as long as arabs will attack israel , as long the astrocities will take place . 
  i 'm not happy about that , but at the same time imho , ** if ** this is needed for israel to survive , then it 's a small price compared to what would happen if israel falls . 
  no , seriously , if you have n't got anything essential to add to the discussion , go troll elsewhere . 
  no , do you perhaps have any essential argumentation in given topic or are you only able to troll others with your primitive ad hominem groaning ? 
  if the second is right , please do n't waste my time and get lost . 
  thank you . 
  of course i do . 
  i do n't see anything bad in it . 
  i mean , who cares about their opinion and their labeling anymore ? 
  they 're a joke at this point . 
  about the people themselves , you 're right , i do care about them :3 . 
  they have a suicidal tendency . 
  i 'm not , you got it all wrong . 
  i 'm looking from a geopolitical perspective and turkey is attempting for a much more assertive policy than western powers are willing to give them . 
  it 's clearly a rising power in the region , spreading influence not only in the middle east , where it slowly becomes the most important power but also retaking influence in countries like bosnia or albania . 
  the geopolitical factor is constant and without israel , there 's one strong power less to balance turkey in this region . 
  politics is n't black and white , and as i said before , israeli attitude towards arabs in palestine is a small price from preventing a much bigger distastaer that would happen if israel falls , not to mention that many of those astrocities are caused by arabs themselves and many others are n't how they look like in left-wing media . 
  arabs have democratic rights in israel , jews do n't have those nor in gaza , nor in ` palestinian state ' structures and if you look at the history of arab-israeli wars , it 's almost always arabs breaking the peace and then loosing . 
  so this is n't one-sided as you 'd like to see . 
  it was n't idiotic , it worked for the time to make most of the continent join the effort . 
  the 're was n't a competing ideology able to do that . 
  you 're judging history from a xxi perspective . 
  that 's idiotic , but i 'm not surprised . 
  the geopolitical factor is constant and turkey 's influence in the region is on the rise , so you 're wrong again . 
  i do n't like repeating myself . 
  no , you 're wrong becouse you 're imputing me things i did n't say . 
  i did n't say crusades went well . 
  they obviously did n't , that 's why we had the ottoman empire . 
  the reasons behind crusades was to prevent something like that from happening . 
  today , if israel falls , there 's going to be one important power less balancing turkey , which is going to be free to push it 's influence and power on greece , serbia and bulgaria . 
  who cares about these pc people anymore ? 
  oh god , how old are you , 14 ? 
  deus vult was a pretext and a unifying ideology , the reasons why crusades happened were the same as always - geopolitical , which was an islamic threat for south-eastern europe and for christian ( western , back then ) population living under islam in the middle east . 
  why do i even have to write such obvious things . 
  i can support israel easly . 
  i know that if israel falls , it 's going to be geopolitical catastrophe during which these few current , rather small atrocities done by israel wo n't be even remembered with the amount of bloodspill that would happen in such scenario and with the geopolitical change this would cause , making turkey a much stronger power . 
  if these few atrocities is what it takes , to make israel a strong , stable power in the region , then bash me how much you like , i wo n't change my mind , it 's not a high price in geopolitical terms . 
  wrong . 
  anyone with decency and europe 's values at his heart should support israel as a stable regional power . 
  the same geopolitical reason why europe went to crusades . 
  sorry , i did n't mean to address this post exclusively to you , i got your intentions . 
  every country that cares about western civilisation should support israel as much as it takes . 
  people used to die for their countries . 
  if you 're afraid of being called a racist , then you already lost and you deserve it . 
  not in europe . 
  killing innocents is n't the goal of terrorism so it should n't be the way of measuring the influence terrorism has on lifes . 
  told you it will happen . 
  this is the new normal . 
  do n't be grumpy !, 
  oh , the obligatory `` well , i 'm an atheist but i do respect this guy '' comment . 
  it can . 
  it 's called revolution . 
  being called a racist is a very small price for safety . 
  screw them . 
  you are the person that 's stupid and did n't get it . 
  i was n't talking about the moral sense , but about biological sense . 
  nature rewards being smart , punishes for being stupid . 
  you ca n't avoid that . 
  and downplaying islamic threat is being stupid - as a society . 
  nothing , you just lack knowledge on this event . 
  read other comments . 
  civilisation is far away from `` being nice '' . 
  you have no data so get lost and stop groaning . 
  they do n't care . 
  now what ? 
  it 's not a statistic , maybe when you end 4th grade you 'll learn what 's a statistic and how do you measure them , you do n't have those . 
  i was massively downvoted here about a year ago when i said that radical islam is spreading in kosovo . 
  i know , becouse you never had any sources and statistics and despite that you 're spitting shit out of your mouth . 
  i knew that from the beginning . 
  no , actually i did n't . 
  a pan-european burglary ring . 
  integration goes well also on the crime field . 
  i wonder if the commision is somehow supporting similiar standards in crime for all of our burglars . 
  that i understand . 
  what i do n't get is that forever clause on this . 
  wishful thinking of the authors ? 
  this is n't contradicting anything i said in that post . 
  the amount of downvotes i got when i said 2 years ago that putin is n't any geopolitical genius . 
  so what 's the reason of having this forever clause ?
