  what 's the gdp of this ` federation ' . 
  spanish ? 
   hadith not only . 
  according to quran too :  they wish that you should reject faith as they reject faith , and then you would be equal ; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them , until they emigrate in the way of god ; then , ** if they turn their backs , take them , and slay them wherever you find them ** ; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper . 
  not all muslims are terrorists but all of them are reading quran . 
   they wish that you should reject faith as they reject faith , and then you would be equal ; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them , until they emigrate in the way of god ; then , ** if they turn their backs , take them , and slay them wherever you find them ** ; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper . 
   but if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due , then are they your brethren in religion . 
  we detail our revelations for a people who have knowledge . 
  and if they break their pledges after their treaty ( hath been made with you ) and assail your religion , then fight the heads of disbelief - lo !, 
  they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist . 
  and hadiths sahih bukhari  ... the prophet said , ` if somebody ( a muslim ) discards his religion , kill him . ', 
   allah 's apostle never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations : ( 1 ) a person who killed somebody unjustly , was killed ( in qisas , ) ( 2 ) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and ( 3 ) a man who fought against allah and his apostle and deserted islam and became an apostate . 
   allah 's apostle , ` whoever changed his islamic religion , then kill him . 
   there was a fettered man beside abu muisa . 
  mu'adh asked , ` who is this ( man ) ? ', 
  abu muisa said , ` he was a jew and became a muslim and then reverted back to judaism . ', 
  then abu muisa requested mu'adh to sit down but mu'adh said , ' i will not sit down till he has been killed . 
  this is the judgment of allah and his apostle ( for such cases ) and repeated it thrice . ', 
  then abu musa ordered that the man be killed , and he was killed . 
  abu musa added , ` then we discussed the night prayers ' al-muwatta of imam malik  the messenger of allah said , `` if someone changes his religion - then strike off his head . 
  reliance of the traveller ( islamic law )  when a person who has reached puberty and is sane voluntarily apostatizes from islam , he deserves to be killed, 
  it 's scary , that people were talking about this for fucking 20 years and nothing happened , except that they were labeled racist and bigoted . 
  a 15 year old could predict where is we and me heading , but grownups in power could n't . 
  strange  . 
  i can live without them . 
  zapiekanka anyone ? 
  people from many third world societies does n't understand the concept of atheism . 
  people here do n't understand that without basic knowledge about science , atheism is just an alien , incomprehensible ideology . 
  you could not have been an aware atheist before darwin , newton and generally modern science was born becouse there were no non-religious ways of explaining the world and these people often come from a background that is n't aware about what modern science is , even in generals sense . 
  it is n't . 
  this guy is like that . 
  old-school . 
  was massively downvoted here for saying that about 2 years ago when wikileaks was still that romantic weapon against us-led corporated world status quo bullshit . 
  which proportions are bad here and why ? 
  yeah , but focused on eu . 
  euronews is n't an eu initiative , explaining eu 's point of view . 
  i 'm talking about a national tv news station , but on eu level . 
  euronews is a private initiative . 
  once you 've served your purpose , you 're no longer needed, 
  if you do n't vote , you 're supporting ones with the most mobilised electorate . 
  this is how mathematics work in this case . 
  people who do n't vote , vote too , just indirectly , there 's no escape . 
  eu needs to know how to sell itself . 
  those stupid blue baloons are only making people sick . 
  it 's crazy that we have our national tv news stations , american , russian , but no european . 
  well in that case you 're going to have proxy wars with others that want to have a market in future 4bln people africa , like china other asian powers or us . 
  soft power is cool , but without hard power , you wo n't do much about the declining . 
  however , africa has to get some shit together first before it comes to that . 
  now we 're having islands of quick development in a sea of misery . 
  i believe that while it is n't a quick process , this new world we live in with instant communication will blend us together into bigger geopolitical forms . 
  current status-quo is n't in eu 's interest . 
  in this status quo europe 's power is predicted to drop in terms of economy , demography and political power . 
  current status quo is fitting sea-powers . 
  it brought peace to the west but imho eu 's ambitions are above that . 
  cultures mix and change . 
  even the great ones . 
  besides , china is n't the oldest civilisation . 
  mesopotamian , egyptian and indus are older . 
  and changed throught history as well . 
  china is big , but not exceptional in this matter and in my opinion it 's in their own interest to blend in a bit . 
  yeah , but i think you 'd agree that it would be much easier if china became a westernized country , like japan or south korea . 
  china is n't seeing international relations as a mosaic of partnerships . 
  i 've talked to many spanish and all of them seemed to be very liberal . 
  so it 's surprising to me that you 're having neo-francoists in power . 
  why it 's only me around here that thinks china and eu are natural allies in geopolitical context - if ideological issues are being put away . 
  there are no conflicting interests between those two organisms . 
  it 's not . 
  what bad decisions has trump done so far ? 
  it depends what 's the level of stupidity . 
  someone can be intelligent but lack wisdom . 
  i do n't believe that someone leading a big organisation like a political party can be stupid . 
  they are smart , yes , those politicians we do n't agree with too . 
  that does n't mean they all have wisdom which is needed to make long-term successes . 
  she wanted to look fun , end up looking odd . 
   you ca n't stop these programs because there are people who genuinely need them . 
  nobody proposes to stop them , but to do what germany did or other european economies when found that they ca n't afford them any longer at those levels . 
  you 're constantly imputing people things they did n't say , you 're a dishonest debater  this discussion is over . 
  and you lost it . 
   the government ca n't force people to work . 
  that 's what dictatorships do . 
  nobody wants to force people to work but it would be more effective for the economy if they 'd choose to find a job instead getting benefits and they wo n't start searching for a job if the state is generous and unconditional at giving them away . 
  at certain level of income , it 's nonsense to work for money , if you get money for free and it 's a rational decision to avoid work . 
   i disagree . 
  then you do n't know anything about human nature or nature itself . 
  i blame the government becouse they should know how people are motivated , education wo n't change this . 
  i 'm sure he knows the solution , but he does n't know how to force it , it 's going to be even harder since as i heard from french redditors , socialists are already trying to stick to him . 
   again , france has always had employee friendly regulations . 
  but they were n't always exaggerated like they are today and most of european countries cut benefits when realised that they ca n't afford them longer on previous levels . 
  it happened in germany and it fixed a lot of things , while france went the other way and now faces problems . 
   you 're repeating tabloid propaganda . 
  you 're not providing any arguments and i do n't even know any french tabloids . 
  our tabloids are n't interested in your economy . 
  these are my conclusions . 
   france has spent millions in helping these people find new jobs . 
  some simply refuse to do so while invoking age and stubbornness . 
  why would they seek for a job , it costs time , effort , it 's probably not satisfying at start , they 'd have to learn something new ... if they get benefits anyway . 
  i do n't believe he has the balls to stand against the angry working business hating french mob that got used to current , unhealthy situation where workers are spoiled with working law benefits and it 's still not enough for them . 
  he wo n't do it , especially with populists being so high in polls . 
   the economic problems are mostly due to technological shifts in the industry and people that are mostly unwilling to learn new things . 
   there are lots of coal towns , that ran out of business decades ago , which are still asking for coal jobs to return .
