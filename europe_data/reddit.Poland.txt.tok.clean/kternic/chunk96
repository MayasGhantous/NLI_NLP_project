  the damage that pis could done to our country or eu has already been done . 
  they calmed down , they probably wo n't be trying to change the constitution , we 're not even half-way where hungary has put itself , but it 's we who are being critisized the most . 
  imho , macron who sees france as a strong eu leader is just trying to shut down any competition to merkel 's heart in an attempt to rebuild the old eu which was based on german-french leadership and this was pretty much gone after eu expanded eastward . 
  according to this site which shows average results from 5 research centers , pis support is stable and po gains are due to n. loses . 
  pis is far from `` clearly '' losing support , but the situation on the opposition changes . 
  po + . n had always have bigger support than pis alone , so this is n't a big difference in this context . 
  po is gaining becouse . n fucked up : http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/, 
   we french really love to ( pretend to ) have the moral high ground  it 's not getting worse at all . 
  au contraire . 
  rotfl . 
  maybe that 's why after 16 years of fighting islamic terrorism it 's only getting worse with every year . 
  maybe give a chance to revenge ? 
  okay , thanks for clearing that . 
  `` most '' are already included in my example . 
  so it 's about numbers . 
  having that logic in mind , according to you , death penalty should be in our law systems if ( number_of_prevented_crimes  number_of_executed_innocents ) . 
  am i right ? 
  becouse i do n't really believe anyone has this data as we ca n't have both solutions at the same time . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm against death penalty , but with different reasons . 
  even if some of those 999 who were n't innocent were stopped from commiting further crimes on innocent people thanks to death penalty becouse otherwise 222 of them would get out of prison for good behaviour after 25 years and 22 of them would murder someone after that ? 
  in such case it 's still not worth it ? 
  so you 're a death penalty supporter . 
  allright , not blaming here . 
  i 'm not asking for it . 
  finally , an answer with some reasonable argumentation . 
  thanks . 
  but did he deserve it from a moral perspective ? 
  agree, 
  there 's a bit of correlation on this chart . 
  people from smaller countries but with their own language are usually more often learning foreign languages becouse not everything is avalible in their language . 
  that 's now how law works at all . 
  if my method is ` pillow fight for anything ' , does it means that i should be hit with pillows if i do something ? 
  nope . 
  becouse people should be equal under one law and your proposal is contradicionary to it . 
  nothin , just trying to get those centrist 's hearts . 
  so , / r/europe is in favor of death penalty now ( since mussolini ** deserved ** his ) ? 
  how do you know that ? 
  there was a poll ? 
  it 's of course you who 's denying , ** you did n't prove anything ** and you ca n't stand that you 're wrong . 
  islam seeking the poor to join is one of the reasons islam is better at expansion and none of your data contradicts that the share of muslim in world population will grow , just like it grows almost constantly for the last 1400 years . 
  you 're being completely ignorant becouse you ca n't read statistics or you do n't know them . 
  glad that you run away . 
  i hope you can at least keep your word , becouse you do n't add anything to a discussion but primitive denial which you ca n't even support . 
  you did n't at all . 
  if reaching to the poor is one of the methods islam has , it proves mu point , becouse as data shows - it 's a good method . 
  in one century it 's going to be conquest , in another this . 
  i did n't say islam has one method of expanding . 
  i know these statistics on world population . 
  how does it contradict what i 've said ? 
  islam share of world population is going to grow independently from the fact that world growth is going to slow down and probably even start falling . 
  it 's mostly muslim-dominated countries where fertility is still higher than world average ( this is the main reason this share will rise ) or it 's africa , where islam is fastly developing . 
  your argument about africa is n't a real argument , it 's a big question and this one thing you understand , becouse you used `` if '' . 
  so , basically , you did n't prove i 'm wrong . 
  the share of muslims will grow . 
  you did n't provide any argumentation to prove my ignorance . 
  you ca n't read statistics though . 
  these statistics are clear , islam is the fastest growing religion which was my statement . 
  there 's nothing to misinterpret here . 
  data is completely clear , you 're being ignorant : https://www.google.pl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=islam+fastest+growing+religion+pew+reseach and you 're completely wrong on christianity . 
  when christianity was facing islam it lost almost everytime . 
  people in this age are most concerned about safety becouse they 're having a growing family , and she focuses a lot on safety issues . 
  distancing herself from fn makes her more tolerable for less extreme electorate . 
  i thought it 's obvious why she 's doing this . 
   have you really looked the past of christianity to see how it grew too ? 
  yes , when it was confrontating tribal societies it usually won . 
  when it was confrontating islam it usually lost . 
  christianity lost whole middle east , egypt , caucas region , with only few exceptions when it was able to stand against . 
  data is clear on the fact that islam is the fastest growing religion . 
  there 's no doubt about that actually . 
  in every society where muslims became a majority , there 's much less people ready to combat fundamentalism . 
  christniaty was never as dominating as islam is as soon as it takes over . 
  no , i 'm not . 
   anyways , that is a very big if you have there . 
  nature and how the world works is very easy to misunderstand and misinterpret . 
  and yet , the data is clear . 
  islam is the fastest expanding religion on earth , it 's expanding for 1400 years and data shows it will expand in next decades . 
  christianity is growing when it faces tribal societies , like in africa . 
  where societies follow usually a very primitive ideology or religion . 
  it 's fading in old secular societies and there 's nothing to stop it . 
  and when it faces islam it usually loses territory , like in middle east , south russia , turkey , north africa . 
  all data says it will expand in next decades . 
  just like it was expanding for 1400 years before . 
  i have no idea why one would think it will suddenly stop expanding . 
   ** was ** on its way to have a similar fate to christianity exactly . 
  and christianity ** is ** still on that way with nothing to stop that trend . 
  which proves my point . 
  i 'm not blaming islam for anything here . 
  i admire it for how effective it is in taking control . 
  i do n't care that people will have shitty lifes in these societies . 
  i just think that islam is the fate of humanity . 
  if islam is what plays the best with nature , if people under islam are the most biologically effective with populating a territory , then let it be . 
  who am i to blame nature ? 
  you 're repeating unproved myths . 
  christianity did n't succeeded on stopping it 's societies being taken over by secular ideologies becouse it 's not that good at expansion and dominance as islam . 
  that was my whole point . 
  that islam is much better than christiniaty or any other religion at this . 
  in one historical period it 's saudi money in other it 's something else , the fact is that islam is constantly expanding from the time it was created with only few times it was being stopped with an enormous effort . 
  christianity has some successes at expanding when the societies are completely tribal at start . 
  islam has also successes with societies that already become christian or buddhist .
