  hmm , lets check this hypothesis ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weimar_constitution#hitler.27s_subversion_of_the_weimar_constitution  less than a month after adolf hitler 's appointment as chancellor in 1933 , the reichstag fire decree invoked article 48 of the weimar constitution , suspending several constitutional protections on civil rights . 
  the articles affected were 114 ( habeas corpus ) , 115 ( inviolability of residence ) , 117 ( correspondence privacy ) , 118 ( freedom of expression / censorship ) , 123 ( assembly ) , 124 ( associations ) , and 153 ( expropriation ) . 
   the subsequent enabling act , passed by the reichstag on march 23 , 1933 , stated that , in addition to the traditional method of the reichstag passing legislation , the reich government could also pass legislation . 
  it further stated that the powers of the reichstag , reichsrat and reich president were not affected . 
  the normal legislative procedures outlined in articles 68 to 77 of the constitution did not apply to legislation promulgated by the reich government . 
   the enabling act was effectively a constitutional amendment because of the foregoing alterations to the normal legislative process . 
  the act met the constitutional requirements ( two-thirds of the reichstag 's members were present , and two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the measure ) . 
  the act did not explicitly amend the weimar constitution , but there was explicit mention to the fact that the procedure sufficient for constitutional reform was followed . 
  the constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed , but the enabling act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter . 
   two judges what a surprise .

  afaik orban did n't break the law .

  if the protest was 2.7 km long , 30 m wide , 240 000 people means 3 people per square meter . 
  plausible .
