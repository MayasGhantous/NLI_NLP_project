  polish law does n't allow people who are not members of the family to pay fines for other people . 
  one of the reasons for the mentally-ill person to be sentenced in the first place is that there 's no central database of mentally-ill people . 
  [ rmf24 ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-ukradl-wafelek-pomogl-mu-dyrektor-wiezienia,nid,1432691 ) - serbian war criminal gen. radislav krsti\u0107 will serve 25 years in polish prison . 
  he was sentenced in hague for 35 years , but in poland he can be imprisoned for maximum of 25 years ( except for the life sentence , that is ) . 
  after he serves 25 years , he is going to be sent somewhere else for the remaining 10 years . 
  he was responsible for men who committed [ srebrenica massacre . 
  they claimed that the machetes they had on them were meant to be used to take care of their gardens .

  according to the testimonies of the witnesses the sounds the gun was making resembled real shots . 
  austrians placed first ( they probably had more experience with pulling people out of basements ? ) . 
  - students from bia\u0142ystok university of technology have won the [ [ rover university challenge ] ] ( http://urc.marssociety.org/ ) for the second time .

  [ rmf24 ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/nauka/news-lazik-polakow-najlepszy-na-swiecie,nid,1435044 ) - the prosecutor 's office will investigate if one of the mps to the eu parliament , korwin-mikke , incited people to commit crime of rape and/or paedophilia . 
  he said ( i do n't know the context ) `` if you knew anything about women , you 'd know that you always rape them a little '' , `` women always pretend to resist '' , `` paedophilia-like behaviour sound much better and is more reasonable than sexual education of the youth '' . 
  it 's one of the three films about the trilogy of sienkiewicz . 
  the books are quite good . 
  the guy who wrote them got nobel prize for his overall performance in literature , so finding a translation should n't be as hard . 
  the books might be hard to follow without the knowledge of the polish history , though . 
  ooops , you 're right . 
  thanks for pointing it out . 
  [ somewhat reminds me of this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nn-jekeomly#t=2137 ), 
  in poland they are `` optional '' , as in until you are 18 your parent can ask to have ethics lessons instead . 
  while the lessons were technically called `` religion '' , they might have been just as well called `` roman catholic church education '' , as i 've never really learned much about other religions ( with exception of judaism , but it was just cursory knowledge ) . 
  people attend these lessons because without passing them you might have a hard time getting married as a catholic , and parents pretty much force children to attend . 
  there was an initiatives a few years ago to make these classes opt-in and organized by the churches instead , but it 's failed due to part of the polish political scene being rather devoted catholics . 
  it 's unlikely to change any time soon , at least in this region of the country . 
  in poland these subdivisions are similar to voivodships , the top level subdivisions . 
  basically each party can start in any of these subdivisions and each subdivision gets certain amount of representatives , as you said . 
  they can take it if they want . 
  nothing at all . 
  they drive around the border once in a while but usually not bother people unless they have a wheelbarrow full of drugs . 
  when one falls apart the remaining bits are taken apart and serve as spares . 
  it 's popular all across the country but somehow it 's become a local speciality . 
  the most popular ones are sold on plac nowy , in the middle of the former jewish district , kazimierz . 
  it 's basicly a baked baguette cut in half , with all sorts of toppings . 
  prices vary from 5 to 10 z\u0142oty ( ~ 1,5-3 $ ) . 
  not my personal favourite but it can stuff you well and waiting in lines to the most popular places became a part of krak\u00f3w 's social life . 
  to say about what they are - you cut a long bready thingie in two halves , put whatever you like , chicken , some mushrooms , onion , leeks , sausage , whatever really , then you drown it in cheese and then put ketchup/mayonnaise/some sauce or whatever really ( again ) , then put it into an oven . 
  they do n't really have to reverse-engineer to copy , but they can to see which technologies are available to a potential enemy and what are the capabilities of the arms , so that they can take these into account when designing their new systems . 
  hands off our submarines , though . 
  unfortunately some of them were captured and likely reverse-engineered by the russians . 
  after we take belarus back , yup . 
  what would be the point of this subreddit if you had to ask everyone in their respective language ? 
  it 's not france . 
  exactly . 
  the whole point of the proportional vote is to pick the set of candidates which represents interest of their respective groups in proportion in which they relate to the whole population of country/region/eu . 
  it 's not about one 's vote being decisive , if it was we 'd still live in separated caves angrily fending off neighbours with long pointy sticks . 
  it 's not necessarily meaningless , politicians join larger groups in the european parliament . 
  while slovakia might have fewer votes than germany , ultimately their politicians represent their respective views by joining bigger parties formed in the eu parliament , so you are still represented . 
  your vote in the elections means even more than this of a german due to the seat distribution . 
  even in larger countries like poland politicians have to join these bigger groups in parliament , but they effectively represent similar views on how things should be done , above national borders . 
  they wo n't only represent interest of their country , but also the interest of all similar-minded people in the whole eu , which is most of the point of the eu parliament . 
  national matters can be still discussed in the council if they do n't get enough track in the parliament . 
  reminds me somewhat of [ [ polish beer lovers ' party ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) . 
  [ [ here ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kqcfddf.jpg ) they are discussing their strategy in the oncoming parliament session . 
  [ [ here ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zliuwon.jpg ) they are meeting with their voters , and [ [ here ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ivn3m7z.jpg ) they are chilling in between parliament sessions . 
  ooops , sorry , i misunderstood your original post then . 
  krak\u00f3w also voted 70 % against the winter olympic games in 2022 , which means that they wo n't take place in poland . 
  it was n't the case , though . 
  i think voting 70 % against means that the city ca n't host the olympic games , regardless of what the whole country says . 
  if the whole country voted against , of course the olympic games could n't take place either as finances come from the central budget . 
  the referendum here was also held in krak\u00f3w only , but was accepted as a no for the whole country . 
  they knew !, 
  they must 've been the ones who planted the birch 50 years ago !, 
  i can remember a huge 100m banner at hotel forum , near wawel castle `` zimny lech '' ( `` cold lech '' - lech is a brand of beer here , but also the name of then recently deceased president who was buried at the castle ), 
  is n't it pretty much a crime to not allow them to vote ? 
  if something like that happened here during parliamentary elections and if a written complaint was made ( with a statement from a witness ) someone would get at least suspended prison sentence . 
  [ / r/shittyaskscience has solved the perpetual motion problem already ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4rf5w.jpg ), 
  over here you can encounter places where your average speed is calculated based on the time it took you to cover a distance of , say , 5km . 
  it tends to make people slow down a lot . 
  yup , i know about that , i commented on amazon prime streaming . 
  unavailable outside of the us . 
  it 's funny because polish army was meant to invade denmark , should the cold war have evolved into a more active conflict . 
  edit : [ a tactical ( or strategical ? ), 
  we 'd better not ask about what kind of biomass they are burning to get bigger renewable energy share ... 
  the costs are likely to be much higher than related income ; many venues would have to be modernised or constructed from scratch and then they would be unlikely to be profitable . 
  krak\u00f3w 's budget seems to be mismanaged as it is , without strain of hosting olympic games and then funding the venues after the games ( we 've built two big stadiums literally a kilometre apart of each other for euro 2012 ; in the end no games were held in krak\u00f3w . 
  they ended up costing more than they were meant to and one of them is ugly as night ) . 
  [ in poland it 's called italian strike . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/work-to-rule ), 
  it might be that romanians are as used to bitching as we are here . 
  it 's a national pastime in poland . 
  as you can see even i 'm bitching about people bitching at things . 
   in high school final exam ( the matura ) 1/4 of students failed to pass the math test . 
  i see that you also have the cut-off as low as possible . 
  we only require 30 % to pass and somehow 16 % of students did n't manage to get this much last year . 
  you can also get 50 % of points for single-choice a , b , c , d questions . 
  one really has to be shit at maths to fail this . 
  edit : [ this gif shows how low the bar is set ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6a8sdmu.jpg ), 
  growth is relative , in a poor country of course people are going to be unhappy even if they had 5 % growth . 
  they do n't want to wait 10 years to see the change . 
  `` to fight with the ever rising unemployment problem in the eu angela merkel suggested creating network of arbeitslagers in strategically placed locations all over europe . '',

  [ [ gazetalubuska.pl ] ] ( http://www.gazetalubuska.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20140516/powiat17/140519544 ) - it 's been raining and there are risks of local floods ( especially in the south-east ) , but it 's not that bad as in 2010 . 
  some police and army units were dispatched to help in the areas most affected by the floods . 
  [ at least one fatality . 
  basically it 's a country-wide students ' party with roots in xvth century .
