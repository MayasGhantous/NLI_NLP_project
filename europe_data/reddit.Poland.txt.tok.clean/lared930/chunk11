  it 's a quite popular annual event during which various museums all across the country are open for free at night . 
  - krak\u00f3w is going to have a referendum next week ( parallel to the eu parliament elections ) about hosting the olympic games . 
  given the attitude of most people towards the games , poland will withdraw from being a candidate for hosting the games . 
  [ [ urz\u0105d miasta krakowa ] ] ( https://www.bip.krakow.pl/?bip_id=1&amp;mmi=12652 ) - students from bia\u0142ystok technical university are going to take part in university rover challenge in utah . 
  last year they won , closely followed by their colleagues from wroc\u0142aw university of technology [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-studenci-ponownie-ruszaja-na-podboj-marsa,nid,1425227 ) - nato exercises dynamic monarch 2014 are taking place at gda\u0144sk bay . 
  their main purpose is to exercise submarine rescue missions . 
  the next week a simulation of collision of two submarines will take place .

  ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ip_over_avian_carriers ) - a motorcyclist managed to collect 140 points on his licence when running away from the police . 
  it 's 5 times the amount you have to get to lose your licence . 
  he is going to face court soon . 
  it saved your asses one or two times . 
  we 'd acquire some new borders , there 'd be plenty of choices !, 
  and these bloody mountains make it harder to invade them . 
  at my university even some wooden boards at the wall ( placed so that benches would n't damage the walls ) have these little eu stickers . 
  apparently the eu funded only half of them , as only every second one of these have the sticker . 
  i think / r/europics is a more appropriate subreddit for these . 
  correct . 
  the new ministry of education textbooks are not to change for at least three years . 
  they will lose a ton of money if these textbooks go into use . 
  they charge 235z\u0142 a set of books for each year in primary education . 
  it 's interesting if it 'll affect the plans of rolling these textbooks in september . 
  i agree that they are one of the most prestigious universities in poland , and the media is also to blame ( completely unsurprisingly ) , but i 'd expect them to handle it more gently , as in not giving the media hyenas more political meat to feast on . 
  they could have said just that they do n't award h. c. to active politicians , and just it . 
  would n't it look more professional ? 
  i 'll try to make them more readable the next time , thanks for the tip !, 
  that 's true . 
  apparently the vote took place a year ago , and some professors objected due to the reasons listed . 
  the rector also said that it 's not usual to award honorary doctorate to an active politician . 
  one of the professors who spoke against it is a member of quite far right party `` liga polskich rodzin '' , she also has close ties to `` radio maryja '' , a controversial catholic radio station . 
  another professor , ryszard legutko , is also an active politician in another right-wing party `` prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 '' . 
  he said that barroso `` should kiss hands of the members of the department 's council for even considering granting him a doctorate '' . 
  so you can see what kind of people we are talking about here . 
  while i do n't really consider barroso a person who should definitely get a honorary doctorate , in my opinion the professors should n't have made a scene and political statement out of this situation , as it 's not what universities are for . 
  they could have just refused the proposal of their colleagues and move on .

  the award consists of three elements - 250 000 euro for the recipient , 700 000 euro for a programme picked by the recipient , and the third part , 50 000 euro will ... pay for the trip to make the candidate `` more familiar with our successful fight for freedom '' [ i did n't make this part up ] . 
  ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-nagrode-solidarnosci-otrzyma-mustafa-dzemilew,nid,1421331 ) - [ when a nation-wide exam similar to gcses was taking place , a police patrol bumped into a man who was sitting in his car and reading some maths-related things over a radio . 
  as it turned out , he was helping his friend , who was taking the exam in the nearby school . 
  the cheating man might get up to 3 years in jail for fraud . 
  after contractual penalties were charged , the company said that they could n't get such a homologation because there is no railway in poland where they could achieve such a speed .

  especially as it seems that after the next year 's elections the current government might get less seats than the even more conservative opposition . 
  yup , i can remember it being on the news back then .

  well , we 've bought some training aircraft , some rockets for f-16s , a few krabs , we are , i think , planning to add some wings to the tanks . 
  we need to invest in anti-aircraft and anti-rocket systems . 
  there were also talks about drones , i think ? 
  we are in the middle of a military shopping spree . 
  the expenses will decrease in the following decade . 
  just as a comparison - [ polish beer lovers ' party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) had more votes than he did . 
  he was beaten by a political party made purely as a joke . 
  regardless of their political goals this man is not suited to be a reasonable politician . 
  he said very clearly what he thinks about women , homosexuals and other social aspects without others forcing him to . 
  listen to him and think if you want him to be someone who represents you . 
  as someone once said he could get into the parliament if people vote for him , the thing is that most of his electorate would n't be in the voting age within the next half of decade .

  purchasing power in 1970s poland was at least an order of magnitude lower than that of the us in 1970s . 
  and we are talking of 1970s dollars , too . 
  they were available in the later years ; there was a state-owned network of shops called pewex in which you could buy something in exchange for american dollars . 
  according to an article i found in 70s a pair of jeans would have cost you 10 $, 
  he was aired in polish tv , although with less silly name . 
  russians are somewhat famous for copying and pasting buildings . 
  look at the royal castle in warsaw , i bet you could find similar buildings all over the former russian empire .

  ooops , i 've made a mistake - the northern part of the motorway is finished . 
  the other part is still not . 
  [ here 's the overall state of the motorways and expressways in poland ] ( https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81380146/mapka-igorsel.png ) . 
  green is finished and opened , red is under construction ( except for red with green inside - it 's finished , but not opened ) , blue is d\u015au - environmental concerns and lots of paperwork , yellow means that a bid is currently opened . 
  there are , however , some issues with it . 
  the quality is somewhat criticized as some say that it was made for children younger than 1st graders , or that the content is not very interesting and might fail to encourage children to get engaged in lessons . 
  another issue is the cost - according to the data i was able to get to it will cost 140z\u0142 a piece + ~ 45z\u0142 for exercise books + 25z\u0142 for language learning textbook . 
  i really ca n't see a textbook for learning any language for less than 50z\u0142 . 
  anyway , this is paid from taxes , so it should benefit the less financially fortunate families .
