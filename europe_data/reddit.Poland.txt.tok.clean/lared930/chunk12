  this year the project is going to cover only the 1st grade students , by 2017 all students of primary and middle schools . 
  high school is going to be a much harder problem to solve as i ca n't really see teachers giving up their favourite exercise books in favour of the new books . 
  one of the deciding factors in your future life is how well you pass the matura exam , which is the polish equivalent to gcses/a-levels . 
  you do n't have to pay for the university if you pass it well enough and the public unis have a much better reputation than the private ones . 
  overall i think that these textbooks are going to benefit students , but we are going to see them in action in september and the long-term effects of introducing these new books wo n't be clearly seen for the next decade .

  each school gets a certain amount of money to buy the textbooks and additional materials , then these are bought by the school and then the school allows the students to use them for free . 
  if they get destroyed , the parents are charged for a new one , of course . 
  these textbooks are meant to be used in its initial form for 3 years , after which any necessary changes to the content are made , and then the 3 year cycle begins again . 
  it 's estimated that the cost of buying textbooks will drop by over 30 % .

  imo you ca n't call yourself german if you 'd have major problems when magically thrown in some city in germany .

  jan karski is the person after whom the polish paliament named the year 2014 . 
  he is considered to be one of the most important people who lived through the war . 
  he was a member of the polish underground state , who , amongst other activities , gathered information about the holocaust . 
  one of his feats was getting into a concentration camp while disguised as a german soldier . 
  in 1942 he was designated by the underground to deliver the whole gathered documentation about the holocaust to the polish government in exile .

  glass trap . 
  worked for the first one , for the following ones - not so much . 
  it 's too broad , imo . 
  a train can doje\u017cd\u017ca\u0107 do stacji , but a train ca n't commute to station . 
  do n't even get me started on die hard ... 
  the legal drugs you 've mentioned were banned in poland ~ 3 years ago , too . 
  `` ocala\u0142y '' might be a better match , i think ? 
  same in polish - dojazd do pracy is the closest thing i can think of . 
  to add to that : litigious ( as in someone who really likes to sue everyone around him ) and a subreddit for these things : / r/doesnottranslate, 
  the internet is what you ca n't see as a user ( except if you ping things ) . 
  it 's a bunch of protocols which are responsible for , amongst other things , routing data through the network . 
  the web on the other hand means the www service which works on top of that . 
  so for example a web server ( the thingie that served you this reddit site for example ) gets your request which was transported using tcp/ip protocols , assembles the response and sends it over using these very same protocols . 
  think of it as of sending letters - the web server writes a letter , but to mail it ( send over the internet ) it has to pack it into envelope , address it and then drop it off at a mailbox . 
  everything from then on is tcp/ip until it reaches its destination . 
  an example of services using the internet but not the web might be the smtp protocol used for sending mails , or ftp used to send files . 
  my parents are . 
  all i had to do was pointing them to how to open a web browser , how to run a file explorer , where their e-mail client is and how to turn the machine off . 
  they do n't use more of it anyway .
