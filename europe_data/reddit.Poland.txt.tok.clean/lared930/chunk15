  the last execution took place in 1989 , but death sentences had been handed out until 1996 and death penalty for civilians was outlawed in 1997 . 
  in 1989 there was an amnesty which changed death sentences to 25 years of imprisonment , as apparently they could n't have changed it to life imprisonment due to the law at the time . 
  yes , but some countries might choose not to restrict it , like all the green countries here . 
  ** poland ** we 've won 4 gold medals and not a single silver or bronze one : - kamil stoch , a ski jumper , won two of them . 
  - justyna kowalczyk won one in cross country skiing despite fractured foot . 
  - zbigniew br\u00f3dka won another gold in 1500m speed skating , pissing off the dutch because their skater was 0.003 s slower . 
  also the standard incomplete news : - we are going to count our storks this year .

  - [ two trains were involved in a low-speed crash . 
  all of these countries had their own governments , though , who had some , albeit limited , freedom to chose how to develop the country . 
  their infrastructure was also not built as if they were part of the ussr , either . 
  english ` j' is closer to d\u017c . 
  rz is somehow comparable to a buzzing transformer . 
  could you give some examples of these laws ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  both rz and \u017c are what you 'd say is a j. 
  however it 's not the end . 
  rzy\u0107 and \u017cy\u0107 . 
  the format means `` arse '' while the latter means `` to live '' . 
  they are pronounced exactly the same . 
  rz and \u017c , \u00f3 and u , ch and h are pronounced exactly the same but it 's a huge mistake to write the wrong one . 
  they used to be pronounced differently but during the last century they became the same . 
  it 's due to close to none exposure to the german language in everyday life . 
  when i was learning german i surely was able use most of the features the german grammar offered and could understand b1-ish german vocabulary , but it 's been several years now and i ca n't really recall a single situation when german would have been more handy than english . 
  it 's the same with russian knowledge - yeah , surely people in the 50s through maybe 80s were learning russian in schools , but who is using russian nowadays ? 
  another thing is that while i 've been learning english pretty much since the very beginning of the primary school , german was only introduced six years later . 
  i believe that nowadays you start learning english in kindergarten and the second foreign language is introduced a couple of years earlier than it used to be , but anyway i 've never learned german to the degree at which i 'd feel comfortable thinking in it , while i 've been able to pretty much switch instantaneously between polish and english for quite a few years already . 
  i suck at speaking english , though . 
  i somehow still ca n't travel to the us without spending more time and money than most of the eu citizens . 
  and i still ca n't exactly see reciprocal fees for the us tourists . 
  which one is that ? 
  could you make a summary of the most common running jokes about specific regions of the uk ? 
  it 's obvious that the welsh shag sheep , and now i know about the norfolk deep family love , is there something else ? 
  it 's interesting that one of the excuses for invading estonia was [ an escape of a polish submarine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orze%c5%82_incident ) which was overtaken in the tallin port by the estonians who were operating under german orders . 
  the submarine escaped in the night following the soviet invasion of poland . 
   never refuse shot of w\u00f3dka in poland . 
  if you wo n't find an excuse quickly enough and drink it then you 're not going to be able to finish drinking in any polite way until the second bottle is at least half empty . 
  in poland `` jak si\u0119 masz '' ( how are you ) somehow evolved through `` sie masz ? '', 
  to `` siema '' , which is quite informal and it 's not even considered a question either . 
  it evolved because it was too long i guess . 
  these jpeg artefacts hurt my eyes , people should learn to use png or similar lossless formats with images with text or anything which is meant to be detailed , really . 
  well , we also had some priests blessing [ grenade launchers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcswi76.jpg ) .

  did n't help all that much . 
  it would be foolish to risk building that important link with technology which has n't even been implemented anywhere . 
  hmmm ... 
  in polish buda means some sort of shabby shack or dog house . 
  is it similar in romanian ? 
  we have a lot of these in krak\u00f3w , poland . 
  they used to be used somewhere in austria , too . 
  they are used on the more shittier rails as they are being replaced by new bombardiers of some sort . 
  or near the sellers of mobility scooters for fat people ... 
  they have big breasts both at the front and at the back . 
   they are all affected equally ( isolating other variables ) you could have just written `` ignoring all the data that does n't fit in my theory '' right there . 
  ooops . 
  sorry , i just glanced at some entries on the list , i guess you 're right . 
  that 's true , but the relation between cost of living and earnings might not be linear and vary significantly between countries and regions . 
  by your logic there should be no organisation whatsoever - no town councils , no governments , nothing . 
  all of these organizations can enforce laws which might seem unfair to me , but they also give a lot of opportunities . 
  for example thanks to the eu i can pack by bag , fly over to romania and start some kind of business without much hassle ( not much more than any romanian who does n't know the language , anyway ) . 
  similarly i can go to the uk and steal some jobs without any need for visas . 
  eurozone members are not `` better '' than any other member of the eu , they have the same responsibilities and privileges and are affected by the same laws the other members are . 
  if the eurozone members do n't like the eu they can just say `` ok , we 're done with that '' and stop being members of the eu . 
  capitals are usually one of the most affluent areas in their respective countries - now try this statistics with an average city for each of the countries . 
  they 've been talking about installing it for a decade if not longer by now , with no effect whatsoever .

  [ here 's a map i 've found recently . 
  i ca n't vouch for accuracy of this map but it shows that roads in krak\u00f3w are a disgrace , which they certainly are , so it 's at least a bit legit . 
   katowice / slask : half-germans who have strange language , look like they 're all made from the same fold and keep bitching about their independence from `` the lesser poles '' who plot to steal from their all the time ( especially warsaw ) . 
  rather stupid , but also strong , so watch out !, 
  and they live in the coal mines , the more civilized ones have made shire-esque homes in the local slag heaps . 
  wikipedia says that its pure form was discovered by a german . 
  just to remind - 69 years ago today auschwitz concentration camp and auschwitz-birkenau extermination camp were liberated . 
  also when it comes to opposition i 'm not quite sure if poland would want to have anything to do with supporters of upa and the more extreme nationalists . 
  i was led to believe that they do not constitute any kind of majority of the opposition but it still might come up as an issue . 
  on the other hand ukraine is a valuable trade partner . 
  yup , \u015al\u0105sk cieszy\u0144ski was certainly mentioned , just as brzetys\u0142aw . 
  i also forgot about \u0141okietek playing hide and seek with wac\u0142aw ii . 
  in poland it 's limited to : - baptism of poland - jan hus and reformation - creation of czechoslovakia - 1968 invasion and that 's about it . 
  spain would have its objections as it would n't want to encourage their own regions to seek independence . 
  the accession into eu is going to take some time too , it 'd be much quicker than this of any other country but still not immediate as a lot of paperwork is going to have to be signed . 
  it 's `` d\u011bkuji '' , is n't it ? 
  these helmets look like wz . 
  68 used in afghanistan . 
  our army was selling a few thousands of these for a few euros a piece a few years ago . 
  poke out !, 
  it does n't fit perfectly in the situation but i knew there was a bloody phrasal verb for that !, 
  if he runs into trouble odds are that the police are just seconds away !, 
  if i had a gun and someone was aiming this pistol at me i probably would shoot first and ask questions about what kind of weapon it was later . 
  i ca n't tell by the looks of it if it 's a fake gun or not . 
  i was thinking of wybite oko , permanent damage .
