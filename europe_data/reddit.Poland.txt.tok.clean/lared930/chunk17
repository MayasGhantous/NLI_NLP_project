  bastards !, 
  nope , even the crown and [ insert item ] were stolen by [ insert germans/russian/swedes / austrians where applicable ] . 
  elective monarchy was nice until it went to shit , because apparently you can buy yourself voters or introduce weird laws like liberum veto/no standing army without consent of most nobles which you can never take back . 
  what 's the `` sr '' language ? 
  edit : sorbian , apparently . 
  known in poland as '' \u0141u\u017cycki '' , hence the confusion, 
  the vietnam war . 
  polish people 's republic took some refugees , many of them stayed . 
  you can see them daily if you go to tandeta regions . 
  they often run shops/stands with various cheap clothing from asia . 
  where do you live ? 
  i do n't think i 've seen a nigerian in my life . 
  i went down the road to the town and the signs in english confused me a bit , too . 
  we do n't really have too many immigrants in poland , save for some vietnamese and maybe some ukrainians/russians/lithuanians / belarussians near the borders . 
  they are fine . 
  had russia been included as an option they would have probably won as the least trustworthy nation . 
  in poland it 's free . 
  but we have the smaller part of the mountains . 
  for those not aware of what 's referenced - immediately after bomb going off near the final line of the boston marathon some reddit users started a subreddit dedicated to `` helping the police to find the bomber '' , subsequently ending up blaming various unrelated people and posting their names and addresses . 
  and in poland . 
  we do export golf cars , but not nearly as many . 
  yes , [ melex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melex ) . 
  there might be some other companies , too . 
  you can see these little shits everywhere in krak\u00f3w , they are used to transport tourists . 
  they are also making hearses , actual golf carts and `` retro '' vehicles - you can see these abominations on their website . 
  where i live the tram driver has his own cabin and usually listens to some kind of music . 
  they do n't even sell tickets any more as there are ticket machines in every train . 
  i doubt they could hear anything from their cabins . 
  i guess it 's more common when they actually sell tickets . 
  also a lot of weird things happened . 
  there was a story in my family that one of the family members was a drafted soldier in german army , his brother was a volunteer from the us serving in the polish army in france and his cousin was drafted to the russian empire army . 
  apparently the man fighting for the german army fought against the same unit his cousin ( russian army draftee ) served in in 1914 and then later in the war he was stationed not further than 50km from where his brother ( the volunteer in france ) was stationed . 
  same in poland but you are allowed to ask questions ( as most 1 a ride ) . 
  wwi was also mentioned - fights for przemy\u015bl fortress , russian failure at battle of limanowa which basically saved krak\u00f3w fortress and then decisive battle near gorlice ( russia lost 350 000 soldiers , 100k dead , the rest captured ) . 
  i 'm not quite sure how to classify romania but the rest is i think a reasonable divide as of today . 
  that depends on your definition of eastern europe . 
  when talking about polish-lithuanian commonwealth we actually mean something which would be actually polish-belarussian commonwealth . 
  there was no way that we were actually using lithuanian language as of today to communicate . 
  lithuania used what we call `` j\u0119zyk ruski '' , which is one of the roots of today 's belarussian . 
  it 's actually just a cover . 
  due to decomposing of the body caused by botched ~ ~ mummification ~ ~ embalming the ~ ~ crystal ~ ~ glass stopped being clear . 
  [ here 's an album with photos of it ] ( http://www.audiovis.nac.gov.pl/obraz/87514:1/ ) . 
  [ also an article about the problems he caused after his death ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/religia/oltarz-tron-i-szklana-trumna/m5378 ), 
  i would n't mind a bit of kaliningrad either . 
  i always liked their mountains . 
  a small anschluss would n't hurt anyone in this case ... 
  when russians come up with this kind of ideas even the dead might start turning in their graves . 
  also it 's a bit boring in that crystal coffin . 
  they have too many usians seeping through the border . 
  we 've got a cake ... [ makes polish street signs for vilnus ], 
  i do n't like the idea in the slightest ... 
  especially these with albino squirrels !, 
  if he 's from a certain group of thugs in krak\u00f3w you might 've signed up for a machete fight with your cricket bat ;p, 
  [ ba\u017ce\u0144ski ii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/imwupda.png ) and [ el\u017canowski ii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cwjceok.png ) are quite interesting , also [ rawicz ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/pol_coa_rawicz.svg/730px-pol_coa_rawicz.svg.png ) , with slightly retarded bear . 
  now think about what og\u00f3rki kiszone and kapusta kiszona are . 
  [ i 'm referring to deluge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ), 
  except for the mongol part . 
  and the damned swedes . 
  the austrians also liked to destroy and steal things . 
  or multiple neighbours , the finns . 
  depends on how you think about it . 
  i think that the estonia 's statistics might be skewed a bit due to their richer neighbours going there to buy cheap booze . 
  many places were taken without a single shot , like krak\u00f3w . 
  the austro-hungarian soldiers were disarmed and sent to the nearest border . 
  i have to admit that there were many fights over silesia and the former prussian territories , not to mention lw\u00f3w where we fought the ukrainians . 
  many people died in the polish-soviet war , too . 
  but then again we had no other option than to take by force . 
  the wwi gave us the opportunity after we failed to become independent under napoleon or during the spring of nations or numerous uprisings . 
  there was no hope in making it peacefully , really . 
  yes , you can . 
  it 's a schengen visa valid for travel within schengen , which includes all the countries you 've mentioned . 
  there are no border checks . 
  if you are going to drive a vehicle on your own make sure that it 's equipped with everything you need in respective countries . 
  [ here 's a sample of polish ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ogugebzzh-g#t=50 ) . 
  it 's a bit longer and with laugh track , but sounds relatively normal . 
  croatian sounds like a bit of slovak mixed with something weird . 
  bosnian sounds like slovak but the speaker is drunk and can barely speak but he 's doing it impressively fast . 
  the problem with esperanto is that it 's not nearly as useful as english - amount of information available in esperanto is nearly non-existent compared to english . 
  it 's been discussed multiple times on this subreddit . 
  in my opinion if we are to adapt a single official language of the eu it should n't give advantage to any of the member states . 
  it would imply that one of the member states is in somehow better position . 
  you might think of some kind of esperanto-esque language , but then nobody would learn that . 
  there 's no best solution , there are a few with various flaws , adapting english being one of the most reasonable ones but then again we should ask a question about what would do more good - using national languages or maybe adapting english . 
  or maybe learning hungarian , then everyone except finns and hungarians would be equally fucked . 
  in polisg cze\u015b\u0107 ( glory , in some languages it 's chwa\u0142a or something similar ) is also used as both, 
  i 've made this table not so long ago : | po polsku | po angielsku | | : ----------- | : ------------ | | kurwa | literally ` whore ' , used as english fuck , but see also :| | kurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be a whore | | wkurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be pissed off | | nakurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be drunk | | przykurwi\u0107 , zakurwi\u0107 | to hit someone | | nakurwi\u0107 | to beat someone up | | pierdoli\u0107 | literally ` to fuck ' , means ` to fuck ' or ` to talk nonsense ' but see also :| | * od * pierdoli\u0107 | to snap off , for example ` odpierdol\u0119 ci g\u0142ow\u0119 pierdolony chuju ' - i 'll decapitate you , you dick . | | * do * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up , to make something fail | | * w * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * s * pierdoli\u0107 | to fail at something , but also to run away , destroy something | | * na * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * przy * pierdoli\u0107 | to hit someone | | * za * pierdoli\u0107 | to kill someone , but also to steal something | | * pod * pierdoli\u0107 | to steal something or to report someone 's bad deeds to the police | | * o * pierdoli\u0107 | to tell someone off | | jeba\u0107 | same as pierdoli\u0107 | | chuj , kutas | very vulgar way to say dick , but see also :| | chujowy ( adj. ),

  except for the older people who lived in cities . 
  you can clearly hear that ` h ' is different than ` ch ' , the sounds are created in distinct places in your mouth . 
  i 've never been able to hear any difference between \u00f3 and u or rz and \u017c , though . 
  they must 've died out in the early xxth or xxth century . 
  or maybe they were preserved in some other regions . 
  actually \u0105-on / om and \u0119-en / em are distinguishable , but as you 've mentioned the others are not . 
  it is , sorry , my internal spelling alarm did n't go off because it 's such a rarely used word . 
  and at least where i live the `` h '' is spelled a bit juicy so it could be `` ch '' just as well . 
  not to mention things like wichajster - something you have no idea what its name is . 
  it comes from `` wie hei\u00dft er ? '', 
  had n't he been criticizing putin lately ? 
  i put hitler there to point out that equating implementing parts of some ideology/thoughts with approving the whole ideology can be a logical fallacy .
