  not a single country in the world implements either pure communism or pure capitalism . 
  they take from both systems and then add some ideas from beyond them . 
  you probably do n't like hitler but you probably do support his idea of not using gas artillery shells .

  how many people were killed to achieve that .

  after seeing them being carried into hospital one of the nurses started weeping .

  -- why was poland divided into 49 voivodships ? 
  because that 's how many numbers there are in lotto ( popular lottery ) and each week they draw a number to pick which voivodship gets to eat some meat .

  or some nice `` new '' for loops . 
  or iterators . 
  are you using your mobile ? 
  i 've got polish flair . 
  the choice is going to change , yes , it 's already started with beer . 
  we are said to drink a lot of w\u00f3dka but it 's not true any more in case of young people , we prefer beer as it 's just more convenient . 
  you can drink one in between lectures , for example , try that with a bottle of w\u00f3dka . 
  also as you are never allowed to stop mid-bottle it allows you to think about stopping drinking more frequently . 
  it also increases time between the first sip and being unable to think clearly/move , which is more often than not a good thing . 
  if you want to get very drunk , very fast , w\u00f3dka is the way to go . 
  older people tend to drink w\u00f3dka , though , probably because it was cheaper , more available and more suited to the reality of the communist times . 
  one of the few situations when w\u00f3dka is drank more frequently , though , are weddings and , in my experience , more ` official ' meetings ( name days , for example ) . 
  if a guest , be it your uncle or a friend , brings a bottle of w\u00f3dka , it 's your duty as the host to provide something to eat and another bottle of w\u00f3dka . 
  or two . 
  in general if you are offered a bottle of w\u00f3dka you can turn it down if you have a valid reason . 
  wedding receptions are very special events , from my experience you should prepare at least half a litre of w\u00f3dka for each guest , including children , drivers and other people who do n't drink . 
  a couple of hours after the wedding reception starts , usually after the dinner and a few first dances the father of bride ( usually , depends on the setting ) distributes the bottles and the newly-weds make a tour and drink a shot glass of w\u00f3dka with everyone . 
  until then to the end of the party quite a few bottles are emptied , and when guests leave they usually get a bottle per car ( so the driver can also have a drink later on ) . 
  a few bottles also get distributed to people who were involved with the wedding , too ( musicians , photographers , etc ) . 
  the next day poprawiny ( after-party ) may take place , which also involves w\u00f3dka . 
  recently i 've also been to a wedding there the groom also provided wine ( usually for the women ) and paid for however many pints the guests ordered from the bar , so i guess that thing will slowly change over time . 
  when it comes to alcohol lore it 's worth mentioning the sobering stations . 
  these are institutions where drunk people collected from the streets are taken . 
  it 's the sole purpose of these places . 
  they are also known as the most expensive hotels in the town , as you will get fined if you end up there . 
  there 's always a nurse or a doctor there to help if something bad happens . 
  one of these is located at entertainment street , neighbouring a cemetery , which is quite funny if you take into account one of the euphemism for passing out from drinking - `` zaliczy\u0107 zgona '' , or `` tick off being a corpse '' . 
  i think they meant the whole conglomeration . 
  i ca n't see anything bad about that . 
  that 's true , it 's going to take some more eu funding until the warheads are ready . 
  we also sent something in space about a week ago . 
  lithuanians wo n't be amused if you mention pi\u0142sudski around them , though . 
  ukrainians and belarussians do n't need all that land anyway ... 
  a lot of them have many hundred years of national history , though . 
  you do n't need to have a country to preserve the nation , poland is a good example of that . 
  they are exceptionally small , though , are n't they ? 
  if rhode island conducted all of this it would n't matter much anyway , but if california did it would stand out . 
  poor iceland :(, 
  yet they do n't hand out visas , passports and do n't sign international treaties . 
  they also do n't have their own diplomats or armies . 
  economical autonomy is often not enough to make them stand out on the international scene . 
  i meant that they do n't have direct way of influencing foreign policies . 
  they have to make it through other institutions . 
  i think a more appropriate geography exercise would be to name geographical features like rivers , mountain ranges , bays , islands , peninsulas and such . 
  poor montenegro . 
  they have no meaning whatsoever in the international relations . 
  you are comparing being dick by not inviting for a parade to killing people due to their beliefs . 
  i have n't heard of the british shooting 10 000 polish officers . 
  it 's of course impossible to look at history without taking current state of affairs , which is not that fortunate for poland , as it 's been for the last couple of centuries . 
  out of these three only the last one was directly responsible for mass murders in poland . 
  the western betrayal is very well known , but the current geopolitical situation is forcing us to look west , not east . 
  people complain about it every time the army buys something . 
  some delusional people think that it 's easier and cheaper to develop our own tanks of similar quality . 
  or that the germans are trying to invade us again . 
  a bit off topic - are these aircraft carriers going towards the screen or the other way ? 
  i see russia as the continuation of the core of the soviet union . 
  given their policy regarding former warsaw pact countries i do n't think there 's a need to comment on that . 
  the difference is that most of the nazis are long gone , while the ussr dissolved not that long ago and the offenders went largely unpunished . 
  while there 's no denying that nazis were much more cruel , most of the people alive today spent most of their youth under the communist rule and all the countries involved are still recovering from the economical decisions made by the communists , not by the nazis .
