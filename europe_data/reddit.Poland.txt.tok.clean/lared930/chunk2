  we watch anything that we win at . 
  a decade ago it was strongmen and ski jumping , not exactly the most common sports in the world . 
  being ranked by fifa lower than jordan or libya usually does it . 
  i can assure you that we , along with your car , will be gone shortly . 
  apparently there 's streetview of the mines available . 
  i got a bit surprised when during looking for a specific place in wieliczka i got transferred several hundred metres under ground level . 
  is n't the alexa data collected only from people who < are stupid enough to  use their toolbar ? 
  especialy since the exercises are more relevant to alaska or japan than to europe . 
  do you suggest that at least 6 years ago russians named regular exercises named `` east '' ( because they are located in the east ) specifically so that they have something in common in 6 years with some chechen dumbasses ? 
  about now , rapid trident 2014 . 
  they are very small , but just about as irrelevant as cyclic exercises planned a couple years ago taking place at sachalin . 
  in 4 days [ anakonda-14 ] ( http://www.anakonda.do.wp.mil.pl/pl/1_189.html ) , exercises led by poland with participation of nato forces will take place at [ orzysz ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/hxrfi ) , 50km from the border of russia . 
  the main theme of the exercises is introducing other nato armies into the fight . 
  jesus christ people , exercises like that are done by militaries all over the world . 
  just next month poland is going to exercise about as close to kaliningrad as it gets and it will not be a very russian-friendly exercise either . 
  the russian exercises are taking place just about as far away from ukraine as it gets . 
  plus iirc if a holiday takes place on saturday you get a day off anyway ( you can pick when ) . 
  if there was a separate category for balice -  auschwitz -  balice then the rest of poland would get maybe 10 % . 
  the problem with estonia is that if you hop between countries estonia is almost always out of the way , just like the rest of the baltics . 
  i 'd vote no , the local authorities are just about as incompetent as it gets . 
  [ with interesting issues in the family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_b%c3%a1thory ), 
  they 've already been used by the [ 1st armoured division of gen. maczek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_armoured_division_%28poland%29 ) , at least as a symbol . 
  [ ^ ( by the way - slightly relevant to both scotland and 1st armoured division ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_polish_map_of_scotland ) edit : [ currently 11th armoured cavalry division uses the insignia of the first armoured brigade . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_armoured_cavalry_division ), 
  interesting , do other countries implement election silence in case of referendums ? 
  when i was a member of a local referendum commission we were to call the police and close the polling station in case of people agitating to vote one way or the other in vicinity of the station . 
  a nearby commission called the police after someone removed a flag of the city from above the entrance , as it 's also considered an offence . 
  that 's quite a low bar to set , though . 
  they are even linked in the sidebar of / r/whiterights . 
  by the way there are ~ 15 people who post in both / r/europe and / r/european who have more than 15 karma in the latter ( i ca n't tell who because i deleted the script i used ) . 
  not to mention that the germans attacked from three sides simultaneously . 
  comparing fall of the berlin wall to a referendum which was announced quite a while ago does n't make any sense . 
  there would be little surprise regardless of which way the vote goes , unless the uk nukes scotland . 
  there are also economical reasons for blocking it from entering right away - any candidate member state has to have functioning market economy and market which would survive competition from other eu countries - you need time to say if the economy of scotland gets fucked or not , because there is bound to be some turmoil in time following the actual separation . 
  i guess that , should a yes vote pass , people who currently reside in respective countries would get visas automatically . 
  after that you could negotiate bilateral visa-free treaties until scotland joins the eu . 
  apparently the spanish agreed not to veto scotland 's entry , but i ca n't see them agreeing on any sort of fast track eu admission . 
  they 'll likely be very scrupulous in following the existing regulations . 
  eu citizenship is not standalone . 
  it is linked to citizenship of all eu countries . 
  if you give up your citizenship it 's lost . 
  i 'd rather we did n't automatically admit breakaway regions as they can be unstable economically , which , as eu is more of economical union than anything else , is not advisable if you ask me . 
  it 's even more justified as reportedly citizens of new scotland would retain their current uk citizenships ( but not their children ) . 
  i 'd rather have some fast track eu joining process in place ( or more likely very fast efta joining process ) than indiscriminately let every newly independent region , however unstable , join the european union . 
  there 's nothing he can do , so it 's quite natural he is not emotionally affected . 
  nothing will change in poland regardless of which side wins . 
  yes , but that would be a little weird if in case of small `` yes '' lead they would offer no such referendum for the `` no '' side . 
  they also only need to convince a few more people to secure their victory . 
  are n't some/most/all of them actually property of the host country ? 
  for example in poland we relocated north korean embassy . 
  he 's a local troll . 
  look at his comment history . 
  my cursory python script lists him at -555 karma in / r/europe . 
  it looks like the patch includes sosnowiec and ends just short of krak\u00f3w , which is ridiculous . 
  are there any bookies who have better rates for `` yes '' than for `` no '' ? 
  they are angry if you have the cheek to actually use the fact that you have the right of way on a pedestrian crossing . 
  in case of a mercedes - very angry and reckless taxi driver . 
  for poles : do n't even bother scrolling , use the location filter . 
  we do n't pass the budget deficit requirement and our debt-to-gdp ratio is hovering just below the required 60 % . 
  that and you need to pass changes in the constitution , good luck with doing that now . 
  euro will have to wait a bit . 
  why would they ? 
  imgur compresses the pictures and strips some metadata from them and stores them for a couple of months , then deletes them . 
  they 'd have to hire a lot of people to determine whether or not the pictures are really yours and then would have no profit from them . 
  i believe fair use in our local law already covers that ( paragraph 28 pa ) , but it 's good that it 's now standardized across the whole eu . 
  we 'll be lucky if we build one nuclear power plant by 2030 . 
  meh , i could do without a job if i received salary every month . 
  some people travel extensively across europe , to do business or other things . 
  i would n't be surprised if they felt more european than anything else . 
  pisa tests are for children in age of 15 . 
  in poland that 's currently middle school , just before specialization of education . 
  it is fine to measure quality of basic education but leaves out most important part which occurs just before deciding to work/study . 
  unfortunately due to differences in the models of education across europe , not to mention oecd countries , it would be tricky to measure the quality of education later on . 
  nuclear power is unlikely to reduce oil consumption . 
  it 's much more likely to reduce the usage of coal . 
  bloody subscribers , taking our karma ... 
  it 's a shame our politicians did n't push poland to have connection to this pipeline . 
  now we can only rely on jama\u0142 going through belarus . 
  well , at least something that is labelled as tea . 
  i 've bumped into this kind of people in person . 
  they seem to be normal but when the discussion turns to politics they would organize prompt executions for all muslims . 
  even despite that there are virtually none of them here , and these who are have never caused any problems . 
   he deserves to lose his licence for that . 
  to lose his licence he would have to have one in the first place , he does n't . 
  he might have already lost it , given he is 37 . 
  he will be tried in court for his offences . 
  ** poland ** random order - polish mig-29s have returned from the fifth air policing mission in the baltic countries . 
  they saw increase in the number of intercepts , having intercepted foreign aircraft 30 times in total over the span of 4 months , 25 % more than during the previous mission . 
  the pilots were relieved by the portuguese . 
  [ rmf24 ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-30-akcji-na-przechwycenie-polskie-mysliwce-wracaja-znad-pans,nid,1494267 ) - while looking for unexploded wwii ordnance left by naughty germans during wwii , sappers bumped into axes left by another group of naughty germans ( [ teutonic knights ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_knights ) ) during late medieval period . 
  they are going to remain here until the middle of october and will take part in the biggest military exercises of this year , anakonda-14 . 
  video in the article . 
  [ [ polskieradio.pl ] ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1225551,amerykanskie-f16-wyladowaly-w-polsce ) * the exercises mentioned above will consist of joint operations of all branches of the polish armed forces , approximately 12 000 polish and 750 foreign soldiers will take part in them . 
  the scenario also includes forces other than miltitary ( whatever that is , probably crisis management ) . 
  the main part of the exercises will take place at orzysz ( 60km from kaliningrad ) , but some elements of the scenario can take place anywhere in poland ( two years ago they were doing something at krak\u00f3w ( ? 
  ) , several hundred kilometers away ) . 
  the anakonda exercises take place every 2 years . 
  one of the key points of this year 's exercises is getting ready to introduce nato fast response forces into fight . 
  - the school year started on monday - the new government-regulated textbooks were introduced in the first grade . 
  according to toe ministry of education cost of production of the new set of textbooks is 17.36 pln ( 4.14 $ or 3.30 gbp or slightly less than 0.5 l of drinkable w\u00f3dka ) and is covered from the taxes .
