  quite a few polish kings were chosen by vote , it did n't end up very well . 
  i would n't go that far , but we are certainly more welcome than you are :p, 
  you can at least burn them in your chimney so you wo n't be cold !, 
  in x and xi century in krak\u00f3w ( and basically the whole region ) they used iron axe heads as a method of payment . 
  why axe heads ? 
  because shitty iron would fall apart rather than form an axe head . 
  they weighed up to 0.7 kg each . 
  in 1979 someone found that under his town house there were 4212 axe heads , they were buried there a long time ago , in the second half of ixth century ( a century before poland was formed ) , outside the city 's fortifications . 
  they were never unburied , probably because of the moravian attack and terrain change ( a new chain of fortifications ) . 
  if someone unburied the whole 3.5 tonnes of iron back in xth century , he would become a very rich person , he could buy several hundred heads of cattle . 
  why do i mention this ? 
  [ when they were found they were connected by strings ] ( http://www.katalogmonet.pl/images/newsy_2013/krakow/krakow%2007.jpg ) . 
  and i 've just read about it . 
  by the way it was by far the biggest discovery of this kind in the whole slavic europe . 
  before that they could find no more than a couple of dozen of these axes in one place . 
  it seems like poles are no longer as profitable target as they were a few years back ? 
  actually poland made it into the space 16 years before belgium did . 
  only the ussr , usa and czechoslovakia made it into space before poland did . 
  i also liked `` apologies from archbishop hoser : ' i am not an anti-semite ! . 
  my statement was only meant to be homophobic . ' '', 
  a few headlines : no representatives from france and uk arrived on the anniversary of the start of the wwii . 
  there were only germans . 
  it 's a great victory of democracy !, 
  assad promised to murder people with only conventional weapons from now on . 
  a new disease started spreading on saturday . 
  it causes headaches , thirst , loss of memory and abhorring alcohol . 
  there was an assassination attempt on the royal baby . 
  it 's okay , but has a strange lightling-like scar on its forehead . 
  tens of thousands heads of cattle are seeking asylum in poland due to the ritual slaughter . 
  i think it 's what 's the pharmacist is called in the uk ? 
  it sounds nicer . 
  nope . 
  [ we 've only got a man with a trumpet warning about the mongol attack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._mary%27s_trumpet_call ) . 
  the test was planned , just not announced . 
  we knew it was unusual , some people even correctly guessed that it was an air raid alarm but nobody cared as there was no information whatsoever posted by news outlets . 
  the alarms are tested once in a while , but never in the middle of the day on tuesdays . 
  i guess that if something really happened it would cause a lot of panic , because , seriously , what would you do ? 
  especially as you are in the other part of the city and it would take you an hour to get home . 
  i could just as well continue on doing calculus exercises as air raid is not a good enough excuse to cancel a test . 
  there are basically two - one warns against air attack , so you go to the cellar or whatever . 
  the second one warns against chemical ( and possibly biological ? ), 
  attack , you really do n't want to hide in a cellar if a truck leaking chlorine is standing somewhere near . 
  they are in place so that if something actually happens they can blame the people for having no idea what the signal meant .

  he was planning to fill an armored personel carrier with explosives , have someone drive it into the building of the parliament and then initiating an explosion . 
  the experts estimated that if the attack was successful , it would destroy everything within 60m and kill most people within 400m . 
  a few months ago he was pronounced to have been of a sound mind , so now he is facing life in prison .

  in case of nuclear war our soldiers would n't be able to make it out of barracks , not to mention getting anywhere near denmark . 
  the west 's plan was to bomb every bigger city along vistula .

  his body will be buried hundred miles away and i will lie to you for 50 years about what happened . 
  that 's true , but the main change was that the new occupant murdered less people .

  [ for krak\u00f3w you can use this ] ( http://monitoring.krakow.pios.gov.pl/iseo/ ), 
  krak\u00f3w is pretty fucked in this regard . 
  it lies low in the valley of wis\u0142a , the natural ventilation is shitty . 
  the main source of heat in many old buildings is coal , the city does very little to promote for example connecting to muncipial heating system . 
  they are going to ban burning coal in a few years , but the council is not going to stop burning wood in their chimneys . 
  on top of that you have a lot of cars . 
  yup .
