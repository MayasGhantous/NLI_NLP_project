  the difference is that the majority of their population are not russians , but lithuanians , latvians and estonians . 
  a small update - the referendum in warsaw seems to not have passed ; not enough people went to vote ( 29 % attendance rate was required , ~ 26.2 % people participated according to polls ) . 
  other than that  90 % of votes were for getting rid of the current major . 
  well , what is n't ? 
  to be perfectly honest after all these years the city is no longer polish . 
  nor is l'viv . 
  it 's a shame , really , as it was one of four major cultural centres of poland ( krak\u00f3w , lw\u00f3w , wilno , warszawa ) . 
  [ semi-related ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6tedm-wlz4 ), 
  yes , why not ? 
  the only exception are the local jehowa witnesses , though . 
  apparently they do n't really know what fuck off means . 
  not to mention using the previous names of popes , like karol wojty\u0142a in historical context . 
  that was a really good read . 
  it cleared some of the lithuanians ' views on this matter . 
  in 1994 presidents of both sides signed a treaty one point of which was possibility of using the names of minorities in their own language . 
  the problem was that this was meant to be introduced by some law . 
  now since the beginning the polish side wanted the possibility of writing names in latin alphabet with diacretic charaters like \u017c \u0107 \u0119 \u0142 \u0144 \u00f3 \u015b \u017c \u017a , while lithuanians did n't want diacretic characters . 
  and it goes on and on from 1998 when poland proposed the first draft of the law . 
  at some point lithuanians proposed writing the names twice - once with lithuanian spellling and then in polish , but it was shot down as it would n't change anything ( the official spelling would still be lithuanian/polish ) . 
  in 2002 polish foreign affairs ministry asked the lithuanian side to talk about the issue again , with no lithuanian response . 
  [ here 's a short article from polish foreign affairs ministry ] ( http://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/dla_mediow/sprostowania/prace_nad_polsko_litewska_umowa_o_pisowni_imion_i_nazwisk;jsessionid=d6982580c3b28b2279734afe99664861.cmsap1p ) we could finally get together to fix this stuff , it 's been nearly 20 years . 
  oh yeah , have n't noticed that post down there . 
  also : dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 z g\u00f3ry - literally `` thank you from the mountain '' , means `` thank you in advance '' z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142e\u015b - literally `` you 've swapped heads with your dick '' , means `` your idea was stupid '' baba z wozu koniom l\u017cej - literally `` the woman is off the cart - it 's easier for the horses '' , used when you are happy that someone backed off from participating in something you did n't want him to participate in . 
  the plane is russian , it flies on vodka . 
  they can always dump some fuel into their cabin . 
  we actually fought against each other not that long ago . 
  we like you . 
  [ and your cars ] ( http://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=pl&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rmf24.pl%2ffakty%2fpolska%2fnews-kradli-auta-za-granica-w-polsce-zarobili-1-5-mln-zlotych%2cnid%2c1037829 ) .

  i agree with reducing number of cars , but not reducing them to zero . 
  unlike cigarettes they are actually useful . 
  for example if you work as a construction worker you have to have a car to haul your stuff . 
  if you are a salesman you have to get to your clients . 
  if your workplace does n't offer showers or you live in a hilly area you ca n't bike there , or at least not constantly . 
  not to mention that even in the cities you actually have to resupply shops . 
  so we ca n't reduce number of cars in cities to zero . 
  and we do n't really have any reasonable alternative to car transport . 
  when people die earlier than they should they stop working and contributing to the economy . 
  i do n't know the swiss law , but i think he meant the following ; let 's say that you make 10 000 chf gross . 
  when the pay day comes , you receive 10 000 chf . 
  it 's your duty , not the employer 's , to take care of your healthcare/pension/tax payments . 
  so while you receive 10 000 chf , you have to put some of it aside to pay the government later . 
  well , they both have mountains and a funny language ... 
  in polish it does . 
  `` u kraja '' means on the side/edge , but i doubt it has anything to do with ukraine . 
  the old injection types , yes . 
  the new ones are more humane . 
  not to mention in australia . 
  there is a bit truth to that , though , this week police chased a man who was on amphetamine , driving a car stolen last week in germany . 
  he did n't have driving licence . 
  that too , but attitude of germans towards my father and , on smaller scale , austrians changed the moment they heard him using polish or admitting that he is polish . 
  edit ? 
  : forgot half of the sentence, 
  neither have i ( except on policemen , these near consulates even have automatic pistols !, 
  ) , but stereotypes are stereotypes . 
  i guess that before joining eu some people thought that everybody east of germany spoke russian , drank w\u00f3dka all the day , had an ak-47 and was commuting using a horse carriage . 
  which amounts to about 34 246 years , or 428 lifetimes ( assuming 80 years of life on average ) . 
  incredible . 
  after looking at all that stuff there i wonder how many man-hours it took to design and build all of that ? 
  in poland some homeless people do n't go to shelters because they are not allowed to consume any kind of drugs , including alcohol . 
  they do n't allow any pets , like dogs , either . 
  oops . 
  i just changed all 10s to 20s , thanks for catching that !, 
  the funny thing about dismissing the president of warsaw is that , according to polls , she would be chosen again in the elections . 
  what kind of trams are they going to introduce ? 
  they were testing some bombardiers a year ago iirc . 
  and pants of some teenage girls , i presume ? 
  it 's 2 * 10 ^ 9 $ for the confused users of long scale , or 20 milliards . 
  that 's more than gdp of cyprus or estonia . 
  or about as much as gdp of both macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina . 
  edit : fixed things, 
  i did n't know that they were still using them . 
  til . 
  edit : [ they even give out badges for executing people !, 
  how nice ... ] ( http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027698/corrections-creating-commemorative-coin-for-ronnie-lee-gardner-execution.html ), 
  i guess that they define `` cruel and unusual '' as `` causing bleeding '' . 
  actually soviets knew this . 
  to kill polish pows in katy\u0144 and other places they used lugers , german pistols , and up until 1990s ussr/russia denied having anything to do with this war crime . 
  they argued that this was work of nazis . 
  but germans were n't stupid , the moment the graves were discovered ( it was 1943 , during the offensive against ussr ) they broadcasted the information trying to use it as propaganda material against the russians . 
  they even invited international and polish ( ! ), 
  red cross observers and captured british and polish pows to take a look at the graves . 
  even nowadays the russians are trying to justify this mass murder putting it beside the high death-rate of pows taken by poland in war of 1919-1921 ( which is false , by the way . 
  if you want more info , try / r/askhistorians ) . 
  edit : disambiguation, 
  i guess that chopping one 's head off would be much better than any of these . 
  it 's messy but there is very limited possibility of failure ( if using a guillotine , not baldrick and an axe ) . 
  if they are as similar as polish and slovak - not close enough to have a meaningful conversation without any previous experience . 
  they are still using this method in belarus . 
  maybe in a more civilised manner and on a smaller scale , but still . 
  the body is taken away from the prison and buried in an unmarked grave . 
  the family will never know where the body was buried . 
  edit : wrong preposition . 
  again . 
  you are alive as long as your brain is . 
  if you are shot at you might lose consciousness , but you 'll be still alive for a short period of time . 
  shooting precisely so that brain is destroyed , maybe . 
  that 's how soviets murdered people . 
  cheap method with very low failure rate , does n't require any additional facilities .
