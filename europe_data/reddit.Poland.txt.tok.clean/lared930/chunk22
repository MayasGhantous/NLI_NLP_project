  in poland a prisoner would be asked to enter a room for `` questioning '' , the room would be very small with a desk and a source of light . 
  the prisoner would be focused on the desk and light and be shot in the back of his head by an officer standing behind him ( behind the door , in the room ) . 
  [ something like that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geu0r4xgai4 ) , but this was not in a prison . 
  not that bad once you actually hear how it 's pronounced . 
  yeah , exactly .

  edit : why do i always pick a wrong preposition !, 
  on windows < left alt  while typing 0181 ( at least with some codepages ), 
  not on every keyboard layout , unfortunately . 
  unicode number given by / u/iwasanewt is more universal . 
  i have to admit that that 's a bitch to translate . 
  my try : it 's not enough to talk sense , you have to be able to talk in such a way that you can convince people of the sense of your point . 
  it would n't sell very well here , burek is a popular name for dogs . 
  you got balaton lake instead . 
  do n't be so picky ;p, 
  the slovakian version was a bit easier to translate ;p, 
   slovak-hungarian war til !, 
  there 's a reason why slovaks call it mal\u00e1 vojna ( the small war ) . 
  during a banquet in south america two gentlemen who were sitting next to each other started chatting . 
  to get to know each other better , one of them asked `` where are you from , sir ? '', 
  the other responded : `` uruguay , and you ? '', 
  `` i am from the kingdom of hungary . '', 
  the first gentleman said , scratching his head : `` i am sorry , i 've forgotten where hungary is located . 
  is it in europe or perhaps in asia ? '', 
  `` in europe , of course ! '', 
  `` oh , it 's one of the slavonic countries , is n't it ? '', 
  we are descendants of huns ! '', 
  responded slightly offended hungarian `` descendants of huns in europe and not in asia ? 
  i am sorry if i offended you . 
  you 've mentioned that it 's a kingdom . 
  what 's the name of your current king ? '', 
  `` we do n't have a king . 
  '' , said european . 
  `` we are ruled by our regent , admiral horthy ! '', 
  so you must be in command of a powerful fleet , then ! '', 
  `` actually no , sir , we are not . 
  we are , in fact , landlocked . '', 
  `` what an intriguing country !, 
  kingdom without a king , admiral without a fleet ... are you perhaps in a conflict with any other countries ? '', 
  `` yes , we are . 
  we have territorial disputes with romania and yugoslavia . '', 
  `` then i take it that you are in war against these two countries ? '', 
  `` no , absolutely not !, 
  we are fighting together against the soviet russia ! '', 
  `` given the circumstances i guess that you have some territorial disputes with russia , too ? '', 
  `` actually no , we do not . '', 
  confused uruguayan responded , while wiping sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief : `` dear sir , it might be just me going mad , but could we please talk about something different than hungary ? '', 
  but kudos for getting the bia\u0142owieska right !, 
  the time it took to deliver , on the other hand ... 
  it was the method of shipping that was unsatisfactory . 
  they are context-dependant . 
  for example if someone comments on the state of our navy you can say that we need more ships to counterweight the powerful czech fleet supported by hungarian navy and baltic aircraft . 
  of course we also need to protect shores better against possible joint icelandic-liechtensteinian army landing . 
  jokes about the czech republic 's navy are quite popular here :d, 
  a better economy would be nice . 
  this topic pops out once a month in this subreddit . 
  most of what can be said has already been mentioned .

  they are about pros and cons of federal europe and about different possible styles of this federation .

  [ btw you reminded me of this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mj9tl.jpg ), 
  i 've been learning mostly by reading , much less by listening not to mention speaking , and i have a lot of trouble with pronouncing words correctly and keeping with the flow of a sentence . 
  english also has a few weird sounds , like [ th ] ink , [ th ] e. of course learning proper usage of articles also requires a lot of exercises as they are not used in polish ( still better than learning gender of nouns in german , though , especially as these fuckers are usually different in polish . 
  on the other hand there is an abundance of very good books for learning grammar and vocabulary , constant exposure to the language ( the internet , various books , music , films ) also helps . 
  not to mention that almost a decade of compulsory foreign language learning does its job ( the kids currently in elementary school are going to have more than a decade of learning foreign languages ) . 
  edit : grammar and missing letters again . 
  you can kneel and welcome your spotted overlords if you want to . 
  nah , we are just going to establish a foothold there and then use their fleet to quickly disembark on the shores of the uk , steal all the jobs we can find and then send all the money back home and retreat .
