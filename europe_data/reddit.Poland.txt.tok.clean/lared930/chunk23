  they agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors ' office . 
  the losses are yet to be determined , but they can reach many millions pln . 
  the commander of the base is to be removed from his office soon .

  he is awaiting extradition . 
  ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-scigany-za-zabojstwo-szwajcar-trafil-do-polskiego-aresztu,nid,1028579 ) - [ a cameraman tried to steal 26 bottles of w\u00f3dka , 63 pieces of cutlery and an air freshener from a wedding . 
  he was a bit drunk . 
  it 's unclear why he was n't murdered on the spot . 
  `` i 'm glad that they are gone . 
  nobody is missing them , but one has to admit that when they lived here , these were interesting times . 
  in polish shops there was only vinegar and mustard but their shelves were full of various delicacies , so barter was thriving . 
  we were giving them w\u00f3dka and they would give us sweets , even furniture !, 
  i do n't think we have an equivalent . 
  30 % of ukrainian population consists of native russian speakers . 
  not very well . 
  the volume of gas was vastly overestimated . 
  there 's no surprise , the only gas lines that go through poland also go through belarus . 
  the other pipelines go through slovakia , czech republic and go to germany or are at the bottom of the baltic sea and go directly to germany ( thanks to lack of action of our government ) . 
  they all conveniently go around poland . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/rf_ng_pipestoeu.gif ), 
  they probably do , but there 's probably still plenty left . 
  the do n't specify encoding in their html file , which is probably the cause of these problems . 
  they also use some weird names in code , which show like that : in d3.v2.js :2706 : normal : function ( \u00c2\u013e , \u010e ) { i have no idea what these characters were meant to be , but using non-ascii characters and not specifying encoding is just a god-damn disgrace . 
  edit : found the bastard the script they are using uses utf-8 , which is ( or should be ! ), 
  the standard , but the page itself defaults to whatever the default is for the browser , in poland it 's some obscure iso encoding . 
  it 's called ponglish . 
  stream of english and polish and neither language is used properly . 
  it 's called ponglish . 
  stream of english and polish and neither language is used properly . 
  it 's illegal unless : - the pregnancy endangers life of mother ( it can even take place during the birth ) - the fetus is badly damaged or it has some type if illness which would kill it anyway ( up until it can live on its own outside of the mother 's body ) - it 's a product of crime , like rape or medical experiment ( up to 12 weeks ) ironically the only time abortion at-will was legal in poland was during the nazi occupation . 
  in vitro and contraception does n't seem to be bashed as much as abortion or euthanasia any more . 
  especially as in vitro is now funded by the state . 
  if anyone is interested in other programs you should look up [ coursera ] ( https://www.coursera.org/ ) and [ mitx ] ( https://www.edx.org/school/mitx/allcourses ), 
  especially western ukraine . 
  it could be much tougher in the east . 
  in poland you can lose right to elect , be elected , be a civil servant , a judge . 
  if you are a military member you will also be demoted to the lowest rank possible and if you have any distinctions you 'll loose them and would n't be able to receive any new ones . 
  additionally , the time of the punishment only counts when you are not imprisoned . 
  this verdict can only be used against people who are to be imprisoned for more than 3 years for crimes which are motivated by something outrageous . 
  an example would be breaking the law by the president , for example for ordering the military to assassinate the opposing candidate . 
  another being exploiting his position by a civil servant . 
  shit . 
  it looks like some sort of encoding problem . 
  thanks for your help !, 
  thanks !, 
  it does n't work in chrome 29 or ff 20 . 
  shitty scripts . 
  edit : it apparently does n't work with ff24 , either . 
  not that is interesting . 
  maybe something to do with the system ? 
  does it work for anybody on windows xp sp3/chrome29 | ff24 ? 
  i 'm afraid it does n't load for me . 
  there 's just the top menu and a column of text to the left . 
  could somebody provide a mirror if possible , please ? 
  edit : there is an error in javascript provided . 
  could someone who can see this write which browser he uses ? 
  there are enough hate - `` catholics '' ( these who do n't mind imposing their beliefs on the others , however skewed compared with the actual catholicism these beliefs are ) to make difference in the elections . 
  when they die off i 'd expect the policies with abortion to be a bit more liberal . 
  but it 's going to take another 20 years , so i 'm probably going to follow it from abroad . 
  we also use some words of turkish origin , like torba . 
  [ i keep this guide in my bookmarks . ], 
  ( http://imgur.com/r/youshouldknow/rnjkv ) do n't forget about the alignment , it wo n't work without it . 
  in poland it is technically meant to be that way , but as you know there are people who just would not learn it , due to learning difficulties or just pure laziness and stupidity . 
  everybody with matura certificate is expected to know a foreign language at at least b1 level and in most cases they choose english , some pick german . 
  they waste more than 9 or 12 years of their language education . 
  a bit more convenient form : | language name | first language | additional language | total | | : ----------- | : ----------- :| : ----------- :| : ----------- :| | english | 13 % | 38 % | 51 % | | german | 16 % | 11 % | 27 % | | french | 12 % | 12 % | 24 % | | italian | 13 % | 3 % | 16 % | | spanish | 8 % | 7 % | 15 % | | polish | 8 % | 1 % | 9 % | | romanian | 5 % | 0 % | 5 % | | dutch | 4 % | 1 % | 5 % | | hungarian | 3 % | 0 % | 3 % |, 
  to give some insight - about 30 % of ukrainian population speaks russian , and this 30 % is located mostly in crimea and the east . 
  does n't it kill the cupboard in the long run ? 
  i 'd expect mould to develop due to humidity . 
  yes , if there are only a few dishes to wash it 's much faster to do it by hand . 
  she might have been just an old witch . 
  flair up !, 
  there 's a difference in attitude towards life , probably due to the communist times . 
  when asked `` how are you '' , the most common responses you can get are : - same shit every day - nothing new - nothing interesting -- these might be only weird in some countries , not in the others : - do n't smile . 
  if you smile to people on the street you are either drunk , retarded , a creep or a paedophile . 
  - you do n't call every person you know `` friend '' . 
  there are multiple levels of relationship with other people . 
  a man you know could be znajomy ( acquaintance ) , kolega ( colleague ) , przyjaciel ( friend ) . 
  it takes effort to be called a friend of someone . 
  - if someone is waiting by the pedestrian crossing to cross the street , do n't stop . 
  if they wanted to cross the street they would have already been on the zebra crossing . 
  -- another thing is `` za\u0142atwianie '' various things : the word za\u0142atwi\u0107 has various meanings , depending on the context . 
  here are some usage examples ( the expressions in parentheses express the meaning of `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' ) : - musz\u0119 za\u0142atwi\u0107 z tob\u0105 pewn\u0105 spraw\u0119 - i have to ( talk with you ) about an issue . 
  - could you ( book me ) a room in the local hotel , please ? 
  - musz\u0119 za\u0142atwi\u0107 spraw\u0119 w skarb\u00f3wce - i have to ( solve an issue ) in the inland revenue office . 
  - za\u0142atwi\u0119 ci t\u0119 prac\u0119 - i ( will do my best to get ) you the job . 
  - the soonest the surgery can take place is 2123 . 
  - can i ( do something ) to book the operation sooner ? 
  [ pulls out an envelope and places it inside the pocket of the doctor ] - za\u0142atwione !, 
  - ( done ) !, 
  the operation can take place tomorrow . 
  and a more vulgar example : - za\u0142atwi\u0119 ci\u0119 , skurwielu - i will ( kill you ) , you son of a bitch as you can see , the word `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' has multiple meanings . 
  usually it implies at least a bit immoral deed - for example using bribes , knowing the right people . 
  it was closely tied to communism in poland . 
  for example if you knew a miner you could have possibly put your hands on some cheaper coal - `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' some cheaper coal . 
  with that coal , you could possibly `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' ( get ) some meat at the butcher 's ( there were times when the shelves at the shops were literally empty - there was nothing except maybe for some vinegar ) . 
  if the meat was of good quality you could offer it to a doctor to `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' [ in exchange for ] skipping the line for hip surgeries . 
  were you working at a chemical plant ? 
  you could `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 '' ( steal ) some brake fluid , then exchange it with mr. heniu who had just returned from germany with some new cassette players .
