  after you `` za\u0142atwi\u0142e\u015b '' ( exchanged ) the fluid for a cassette player , you recalled that your brother , zdzisiu , is illegally selling the beatles records on the black market . 
  your brother claims that he knows a guy looking for the very cassette player you have , and the guy can `` za\u0142atwi\u0107 twoim dzieciom '' ( send your children ) for a trip to yugoslavia for half the normal price . 
  i am yet to encounter a foreign word with the same meaning originating somewhere else than in eastern europe . 
  78 people dead , 1011 injured in 807 traffic accidents . 
  2603 drunk drivers stopped , mostly on monday and sunday - some of them were probably driving a day after a party and were still over 0.02 bac limit . 
  no spectacular bac levels i 'm aware of . 
  i think that if you cross the border you also have to wait for the [ bogies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogie ) to be swapped for the ukrainian ones as ukraine uses rails that are about 10cm further apart than these in slovakia or poland . 
  edit : [ here 's a video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmw_shobnnu ), 
  the official language does n't matter really as most of the population uses the same language - english . 
  within 500km of where i live there are over 10 separate languages , and i might be able to have some sort of basic conversation with speakers of 6 of them only because my language belongs to the same language group . 
  it would have been 8 if i had n't been a lazy fuck when i had opportunity to learn german . 
   also just spent about 60 hours in trains in ukraine - a ticket for 860km ride is about 17,2 $ [ ... ] i hope it was n't so cheap because it took 30 hours to cover these 860km :d, 
  it could also solve the problem of bitchy neighbours if executed properly . 
  this submission should have been titled `` the difference in train fares in 7 european countries '' in poland using przewozy regionalne it 's whooping 22,90 z\u0142 , or 5,45 $ , for 100km second class ( although it would take ethernity to cover that distance ) edit : the above price is for interregio second class turtle speed train fare . 
  the regio one is 19,80 z\u0142 ( 4,71 $ ) , regioexpress is 24,90 z\u0142 ( 5,93 $ ) . 
  regio trains operate within a small area , like voivodship and stop at every train station . 
  interregio connects the regions above and stops at every major stations and most smaller one near the beginning and the end of journey . 
  regioexpress stops only at major stations . 
  intercity trains stop in major cities and usually have fancier trains ; they cost significantly more , too . 
  second class ticket is 68,00 z\u0142 ( 16.18 $ ) for 100km . 
  the same company operates tlk trains , which are alternative for interregio and regio trains , 100km ticket costs 26,00 z\u0142 ( 6.18 $ ) . 
  it 's still worth looking for alternatives . 
  we ca n't switch to alternatives within * a * few months anyway . 
  oh , and here we go again . 
  it 's a group of policemen which main goal is to maintain law and order during protests/riots and this kind of events . 
  they are usually unarmed ( as in no firearms , they have shields , pepper gas and this kind of equipment ) and in full riot gear when deployed . 
  i knew i forgot something important . 
  editing ... 
  why do you think so ? 
  who the hell would murder a policeman inside a police station ?

   that 's simply something that will be edited out as more people read and modify the article . 
  the problem is that while it might be true for english wikipedia , the croatian wikipedia contributor 's community is quite small which can lead to a small group of people having much more power than they should have . 
  ukrainians are n't really that foreign to be honest , i 've never met a chechen though . 
  we might also have some illegal east asians ( vietnam/china ? ), 
  but they are also harmless . 
  well , it might be , but economy-wise - not so much . 
  and the economy is probably the cause of so many illegals trying to get a foothold in european countries . 
  edit : added a couple of commas to improve readability . 
  ... or poland being shit hole compared to some other countries which are easily accessible if you are already in schengen area . 
  a plus of living in poland is that they never stay for long . 
  you were right , it did n't contribute to the discussion . 
  while portuguese is certainly spread across the globe , it 's spread in such a way that europe has very little ties with the countries it 's spoken . 
  we are not strategic partners with brasil or some african countries , are we ? 
  russian would be a more sensible option . 
  while i agree that the op ( / u/ichbinsisyphos ) was talking about austrian german , german in general is not really that hard to learn for everyone , the portuguese use romance language and that 's the problem . 
  i find it only a bit more complicated than english , and it 's not really ugly - of course if you only listen to hitler , it would be . 
  and by the way , hitler is history , get over with it . 
  most of the poles did , and we were much more affected than the portuguese . 
  i wish i could opt-out of the church tax ... edit : could somebody explain what was wrong with my post so it got downvoted please ? 
  in poland all churches receive subsidies from the budget , mainly to cover insurance of priests . 
  catholic church also collects money during every single mass , for each ceremony like wedding or funeral , and is well capable of funding itself only with these , voluntary , payments . 
  the church fund is small , and i would probably not opt out of contributing to it , but i 'm still against not having a choice . 
  i prefer to contribute directly to charities organised by the catholic church or local jewish community than to pay for heating in a church i will probably never visit . 
  a co z [ jo\u017einem z ba\u017ein ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoja6rdov1w ) ? 
  because german in general is much more relevant in europe . 
  there are ~ 11mln portuguese while the number of german native speakers reaches ~ 100mln people . 
  and w\u00f3dka to make it a party . 
  z jajem , but it would n't really make sense , as the expression is only valid with plural form of jajo . 
  singular form means that he likes making jokes . 
  that 's nothing !, 
  we had [ polska partia przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 piwa ( polish beer-lovers party ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) . 
  they even got 16 seats in the parliament . 
  their slogan was `` it would n't be better , but for sure it would be funnier '' . 
  some time after the elections they split up internally into two groups - small beer and big beer . 
  talking about unfortunate names : [ ewa missa\u0142a ] ( http://c.wrzuta.pl/wi519/abd723a900015904456b38a2/ewa_missala ) ( ewa sucked-me-off , the inscription below - `` me too !, 
  the most clever ones are the solidarity ones from the last years of socialism : [ the first one with a description ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3cyhdys.jpg )  [ the elections of 1989 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1989 ) had been the first opportunity since 1939 for poles to freely express their political beliefs by electing their officials . 
  poland was one of the first countries in the eastern block where the political opposition had some sort of real power . 
  in order to change polish constitution , you had ( and still have ) to have 66 % of votes in sejm ( the lower house ) . 
  as the solidarity won every single one of electable seats ( 35 % ) in the lower house , they could block attempts of the government to disadvantage solidarity and other political groups . 
   the outcome of these elections clearly showed what the people thought . 
  out of 161 electable seats in the lower house , 161 were won by the solidarity . 
  in senate , the upper house of the parliament , 99 out of 100 were won by solidarity and the remaining one was won by an independent candidate . 
  these elections were amongst the first steps in the eastern block which led to the fall of the communism . 
  on 27 october 1991 , the first free elections since the mid-war period took place in poland . 
  mind you that it was about two weeks before the berlin wall fell . 
   as you can see there are three flags in the poster . 
  the first one is fully red , and has 0 % written underneath it . 
  it symbolises the communist poland up until the elections , 0 % of political freedom . 
  the second flag slowly emerges from the red - showing the start of changes . 
  35 % refers to the electable seats in sejm . 
  the last flag is clearly the current polish flag - it shows 100 % , political freedom . 
  please note that this flag is not disconnected from the red rectangle - poles can not forget the communism times , as it was part of our history . 
  the red colour on our flag , as might mean blood spilled by the communist governments , but also bravery and a will to put up a fight . 
  -- [ at high noon on the 4th of june 1989 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ourvrb.jpg )  the note gary cooper is holding says `` elections '' . 
  the inscription at the bottom says :  high noon ( at the high noon )  4th june 1989 / / elections date  the author wanted a contrast - good versus bad - westerns from the 50s were keenly watched , because it was the time censorship was loosened . 
  if you 've seen the movie , you can clearly divide people in two groups - the good ones - including the sheriff , and the bad ones - including bandits he fought . 
  the man was easily recognizable , the title of the movie he starred in could be used in the given context - if you removed solidarno\u015b\u0107 and the date at the bottom as well as the piece of paper he 's holding , you would get a movie poster . 
  the author states that `` he [ the sheriff ] had to be a widely recognised person , able to handle the situation '' .
