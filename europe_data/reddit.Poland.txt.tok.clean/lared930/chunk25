   the poster was n't meant to be mass printed either - the artist made 4 copies on his own , and then he could n't find anybody willing to print it , as the poster was deemed by various solidarity members to be `` too aggressive '' . 
  by sheer luck one man accepted his poster , sent it to france , where it was copied , and the posters returned to poland at the midnight of 3/4 june 1989 . 
  -- modern posters are very far from this level . 
  usually limited to a smiling face with a slogan on the side and the flag in the background . 
  if they included particles it would probably turn out that instead of breathing i could just as well sniff asbestos . 
  here 's the history of russian embargo imposed on poland : 2005 - 2007 - meat embargo 2006 - 2008 - embargo on flowers , fodder , seedlings 2009 - threats of meat embargo 2011 - vegetables embargo 2013 - threats of meat embargo nothing new . 
  additionally every couple of years they threat that they will stop sending gas through belarus . 
  the big red cloud in poland is where our coal and most steelworks are . 
  the other denser one is be\u0142chat\u00f3w , where some lignite power plants are . 
  there 's also warsaw visible . 
  and now they have some objections about our meat . 
  as they have every 5 or so years . 
  could you please outline a few reasons why serbia would n't join the eu any time soon ? 
  what 's the difference between serbia and for example croatia and bulgaria in that matter ? 
  to be honest i would take a uni which degree gets me a job than a uni with high tuition that has great research capabilities and which degree gets me a job . 
  well that 's a normal price for a beer in krak\u00f3w bars , the ones you can buy in shops ( the same brands ) are usually less than half of that . 
  you could probably get it here , too , if you asked , but it 's just not done . 
  how much did you pay ? 
  how much do you have to pay for yours ? 
  yes , bottled . 
  usually the only type available . 
  actually it 's not . 
  beer is much more common . 
  mostly because if you want to bring someone a bottle of w\u00f3dka he is expected to put another one on the table . 
  and then you have another one . 
  you can stop drinking beer whenever you wish assuming that you 've finished the current one . 
  edit : [ here 's a consumption of heavy ( i 'm assuming  20 % ) alcohols in litres of pure ethanol . 
  yay , our top university is at 338th place . 
  we have 6 ranked ones total . 
  well , at least they are free . 
  the list of european ( at least partially ) countries : 1 denmark 2 norway 3 switzerland 4 netherlands 5 sweden 7 finland 8 austria 9 iceland 18 ireland 19 luxembourg 21 belgium 22 united kingdom 25 france 26 germany 34 cyprus 38 spain 39 czech republic 44 slovenia 45 italy 46 slovakia 51 poland 53 moldova 58 croatia 62 albania 66 belarus 68 russia 69 north cyprus 70 greece 71 lithuania 72 estonia 77 turkey 85 portugal 87 ukraine 88 latvia 90 romania 106 serbia 107 bosnia and herzegovina 110 hungary 118 macedonia 144 bulgaria, 
  it 's also worth mentioning that in germany you have to have sufficient funds to support yourself financially for the next year or semester in advance , so for example you have to show a bank statement with sufficient amount of money . 
  more than that , if you are from the usa your credit system does n't translate well in the ects , so transferring credits might be hard if not impossible . 
  if you want to get your ma/msc there , you have to have ba/bsc in a related field , so with ba in psychology you would n't be able to get msc in cs . 
  also , 2 years programs offered by some us colleges are not recognized at all . 
  he is not talking about overthrowing reddit , he is interested in alternative sites ... 
  the problem with european sites is the language barrier . 
  in order to get rid of most americans you just have to switch language to something other than english , but this way you also lose a lot of people who do n't speak this language . 
  the advantage of using english on the other hand is the fact that the average age and probably education level increase , so you get rid of most kids . 
  and cigarettes . 
  to justify not including it here - i do n't know anybody who watches basketball . 
  football , volleyball and probably tennis are watched more often . 
  then i am not surprised someone turned him in . 
  i 'd be offended myself . 
  if they offered something better i would take it and vote for a candidate of my choice . 
  how would they check it ? 
   a person bribed people to vote for certain candidate by offering them vodka what kind of vodka ? 
  how much of it ? 
  i like your linking system , it allows to add some hyper-links in the descriptions and use multiple sources . 
  i 'm going to steal it , i hope you do n't mind ? 
  whenever i read the news and i find something interesting i just give it a short description and put it with a link in a text file . 
  on saturday i just add hyper-links and am done with that . 
  to prepare something like that from scratch i would have to spend about half an hour , this way i just spend a minute or two every day . 
  try it yourself !,
