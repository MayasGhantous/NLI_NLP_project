  * na * is spelled the same as ` na ' in nanotechnology . 
  * ku * ( without r ! ), 
  is pronounced like ` coo ' in cool * r * is pronounced like ` rh ' in rhino * wi * is pronounced like ` vi ' in villain * \u0107 * is pronounced [ like that ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/%c4%87/ ) the stress is placed at - kur - . 
  so it 's nacoorhvi\u0107 or something like that . 
  find a polish immigrant , [ apply these rules ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmtqe-xlaey ) and you should hear nakurwi\u0107 along with other things . 
  or a bit worse , experience it . 
  itd . 
  [ depending on the prefix , it can have wide range of applications . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jayu1.jpg ) . 
  similarly you can use word ` jeba\u0107 ' , which also means to fuck . 
  most of the time the same prefix will give the two words the same meaning . 
  you can also use prefixes with word `` kurwi\u0107 '' - to be a whore , but it 's considered even more vulgar than jeba\u0107 , which is in general slightly more vulgar than pierdoli\u0107 . 
  here 's a handy list of swear words : | po polsku | po angielsku | | : ----------- | : ------------ | | kurwa | literally ` whore ' , used as english fuck , but see also :| | kurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be a whore | | wkurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be pissed off | | nakurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be drunk | | przykurwi\u0107 , zakurwi\u0107 | to hit someone | | nakurwi\u0107 | to beat someone up | | ------ | ------- | | pierdoli\u0107 | literally ` to fuck ' , means ` to fuck ' or ` to talk nonsense ' but see also :| | * od * pierdoli\u0107 | to snap off , for example ` odpierdol\u0119 ci g\u0142ow\u0119 pierdolony chuju ' - i 'll decapitate you , you dick . | | * do * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up , to make something fail | | * w * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * s * pierdoli\u0107 | to fail at something , but also to run away , destroy something | | * na * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * przy * pierdoli\u0107 | to hit someone | | * za * pierdoli\u0107 | to kill someone , but also to steal something | | * pod * pierdoli\u0107 | to steal something or to report someone 's bad deeds to the police | | * o * pierdoli\u0107 | to tell someone off | | ------ | ------ | | jeba\u0107 | same as pierdoli\u0107 | | chuj , kutas | very vulgar way to say dick , but see also :| | chujowy ( adj. ),

  ( it shows that you are amazed by something ) | | z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142 | he swapped heads with his own dick ( his ideas are dumb ) | and many more . 
  some of these words are used more or less frequently depending on the context . 
  for example . 
  if someone comes up with a crazy idea , you can say that he is `` popierdolony '' , `` pojebany '' or that he `` ocipia\u0142 '' , or , my favourite , `` z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142 '' ( he swapped heads with his own dick ) . 
  example of usage : kurwa ja pierdol\u0119 !, 
  do chuja pana !, 
  - 8/13 of these words are swears . 
  it can be used when for example your computer broke down and you had n't saved your work . 
  edit : oh , i 've nearly forgotten .

  but still much better than attitude towards germans in rota , which was a candidate for the anthem .

  actually germans used the tombstones from the nearby jewish cemetery to pave the roads at p\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp , where most of the krak\u00f3w ghetto jews , including employees of schindler , were send to . 
  i think that there are still some of them at the site of the cemetery ( which by the way requires the service of sheep mentioned above ) . 
  these tombstones were mentioned in schindler 's list and the fake tombstones are still where the movie was filmed . 
  i 'll go and check if the real ones are still there when it stops raining , i 'm curious myself .

  russian is much different from central slavonic languages . 
  or maybe it 's just me who ca n't understand a single sentence in russian but can understand czech or slovak good enough to understand the general idea of what they are talking about . 
  yeah , slovak sounds like baby talk . 
  on the other hand if you think of words like ` samoch\u00f3d ' , they are funny too .
