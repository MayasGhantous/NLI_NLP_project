  around 90 bodies of people executed in warsaw are expected to be found . 
  some of them are expected to be found underneath the existing graves , but to search there , the law would have to be changed . 
  194 bodies were found during the previous searches , but only 28 were identified .

  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-radiowoz-ma-prawo-zepchnac-z-drogi-auto-pirata,nid,1494888 ) - after excise on strong alcohols was raised by 15 % in january ( making a bottle of popular vodka cost 25pln ( 6 $ or 4.75 quid ) the sales of hard ( they 're only hard if you do n't exercise enough ! ), 
  alcohols dropped by 4 % , some project 10 % drop in the whole 2014 . 
  the production fell by 20 % . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-pijemy-mniej-wodki,nid,1494766 ) - a dumbass who was using high-powered lasers to blind rescue helicopters ' pilots was arrested . 
  he can be sentenced for up to 8 years in prison . 
  no , it could n't . 
  we are talking about a non-polynomial algorithms . 
  if i recall correctly using one of the local supercomputers it would take more than the parliament term to approximate the result , not to mention to get exact solution . 
  it 's unfortunate . 
  when there is only one outcome it ca n't really be helped , however there are voting systems which maximize the average voter 's happiness in case you 're electing a larger group of people , say a parliament . 
  i remember hearing a lecture about that , apparently in poland you could exceed 80 % of happiness in parliamentary elections if every voter prepared an ordered list of 600 candidates . 
  it would also take a shitload of time to compute . 
  paragraph 1 , art 141 kk carries prison sentence ranging from 3 months to 5 years . 
  if they break international law they are looking at much harsher sentences . 
  the worst thing about this is that however people choose to vote , about half of the whole population will not be satisfied . 
  it might have been the case that my teachers chose more neutral books than that . 
  the new government books are neutral , only the quality and width of bike roads would require divine intervention ( they look like  3m wide , while the one i constantly use has 1.5 m to share by bikes going in both directions plus a bunch of fucking pedestrians ), 
  legally they are . 
  what crimes are subject to expulsion in germany ? 
  you ca n't render people stateless . 
  it 's against basic human rights . 
  to get asylum they 'd have to get there first , and they ca n't do that without passport . 
  what you propose is similar to what happened in eastern prussia after the second world war - people were thrown out because they were undesirable . 
   those laws and ethics you speak of have proved pretty ineffective they are base of our culture . 
  if you throw them away you are pretty much returning to medieval europe , with crusades and burning witches . 
  in poland at least the government textbooks are neutral when it comes to religion . 
  they mention christmas and easter but only in cultural context . 
  and i do n't know about other schools but in my former ones ethics was basically an hour a week off . 
  when the disabled were being killed in the 1930s people also did n't give a shit about that . 
  who cares about people on wheelchairs ? 
  the same went for jews . 
  they were visibly different , wearing their traditional clothes . 
  sometimes when i see posts like that i have to check whether i did n't come to / r/european or straight to / r/whiterights . 
   it 's easy to move there maybe a hundred years ago . 
  the last time sweden was mentioned more prominently in media was after some guy from there paid some thugs to steal the `` arbeit macht frei '' sign from auschwitz i. 
  so i guess that lack of exposure is one of the factors . 
  it depends on how you look at it , according to matura exams statistics 1500 students sat it , only 400 on extended level ( b2 ) . 
  350 000 students chose english , 38 000 german , 10 000 russian , 3 000 french , 750 italian , 250 belarussian and less then less than 100 people sat kashubian , latin , ukrainian and lithuanian . 
  it might be that people study it but almost never to a level in which they can use it independently or they primarily study it on external ( in regards to schools ) courses . 
  how many kettles are installed on this carrier ? 
  it does complicate things but politicians now try not to bring it up and avoid the topic and being pictured near these symbols at all cost . 
  franca was also known as syphilis in poland . 
  guess which country it was associated with .

  apparently [ our local aviation museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_aviation_museum ) would beat the shit out of your airforce, 
  according to statistics - yes . 
  there was about 10 % jump up in sympathy and slightly smaller jump down in disliking in 2008 , immediately after both countries won the euro 2012 bid . 
  since then there was no significant change . 
  to give some idea about how relations changed over the years , in 1993 the like/dislike stats for ukraine were 12/65 , now it 's 34/33 . 
  some of them did integrate , although many still have strong ties with their families back in vietnam . 
  there are not that many vietnamese in poland so that their food is widely available , although you can sometimes see vietnamese restaurants in bigger cities . 
  it 's estimated that the vietnamese population in poland does n't exceed 40 000 , so that 's less than germany or france . 
  successful vietnamese , just like poles , tend to migrate west . 
  [ the study results ( in polish i 'm afraid ) ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_020_14.pdf ) on page 6 of the pdf ( numbered as 3 ) there 's a table describing how many percent of people described their attitude as `` sympathetic '' . 
  on page 7 the table contains percentages of people who over the years expressed their negative attitude towards the given nations . 
  the page 10 contains chart showing change in attitude compared to the last years ' polls . 
  the researchers found a strong positive correlation between the education level and number of countries the person sees as positive ( tertiary education ~ 15.5 positive countries , primary education 9.1 positive countries ) . 
  the same trend , however , was not observed when it came to the number of countries seen as negative . 
  household income per capita was also a strong factor . 
  compared to others , people who earn less than 750pln a month see more countries as negative . 
  age is also one of the factors which correlate , this time negatively , with the number of liked countries ( 14.5 for people 25-34 years-old , 9.6 for people over 65 years-old ) . 
  older people on the other hand are less likely to see countries negatively ( 6.3 for people over 65 compared to 10.5 for people 18-25 years-old ) residents of cities were found to like other countries more than the average pole , while residents of villages tend to dislike other countries more than the average pole . 
  people who take part in religious ceremonies tend to like less people than people who do n't take part in them at all ( 10.6 compared to 13.9 ) . 
  as to the vietnamese - during the vietnam war many refugees chose to settle in the eastern block countries , including poland . 
  due to their rather poor economic status and lack of the polish language skills they were socially separated - their occupation was and still is usually quite low-paying , mostly construction and selling clothes on the markets . 
  add some xenophobia to the mix and you have negative opinion . 
  title : attitude towards other nations . 
  other countries : brazil 0.53 usa 0.35 japan 0.32 china -0.18 vietnam -0.20 other ethnic groups : gypsies -0.85 data source : centre for public opinion research , february 2014 . 
  in case of the english the data was expanded as opinion about the whole united kindgom . 
  edit : here 's the source pdf . 
  but they would build them the other way around :(, 
  czech and slovak navies are to arrive shortly . 
  yes , there are regular squads of muslim police roaming about berlin and beheading turks who are seen enjoying beer ... 
  the first yearbook is from 2006 . 
  the second pdf assumes that the current immigration trends will be sustained - which will clearly not be the case should it cause any extreme problems as you 've mentioned . 
  the same goes for the last article - it also totally ignores the assimilation of different people into the culture . 
  would you say that black people in the uk are not brits ? 
  their ancestors certainly did n't only came from europe . 
  you 'll likely not find many people to discuss things with because it 's the middle of the night . 
  actually i 'm curious whether they include umowa-zlecenie , umowa o dzie\u0142a and umowa o prac\u0119 , or maybe only umowa o prac\u0119 ? 
  because if only the latter the number of shitty contract in reality is much bigger . 
  the two first types of contract give basically no employee rights ( as they are civil agreements ) . 
  i guess it 's the latter due to use of word `` employee '' . 
  not necessarily , some parents might return to poland - the point is that very few of them will . 
  i already have ( distant ) family members , children born to polish mothers in the uk and germany . 
  you can see that with time they absorb more of the local culture , wherever they live , so you 're somewhat right . 
  when they were children they each spoke three languages fluently , because they learned polish , the local language , and the languages spoken by their fathers .
