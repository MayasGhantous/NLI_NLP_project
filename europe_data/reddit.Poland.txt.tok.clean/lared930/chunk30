  these were meant to go to ofe , but the government are keeping it in a separate account belonging to zus . 
  why ? 
  because fuck you . 
  that 's the only comment about this system that i 'm going to make . 
  to clarify , let 's assume that you are going to make 3000z\u0142 a month , you are actually making even more - but you are not going to see this money anyway . 
  your employer pays 9.52 % ( emerytalne ) + 6.5 % ( rentowe ) + 0.6-3 .5 % ( wypadkowe ) of your salary . 
  assuming 1.93 % , you actually make 3538.50 z\u0142 a month you are actually making , not taking into account some other things the employer has to pay ( fundusz pracy ? ) . 
  now you pay 9.76 % ( emerytalne ) + 1.5 % ( rentowe ) + 2.45 % ( chorobowe ) = 13.71 % yourself . 
  so you get 2588.70 z\u0142 . 
  you might say `` fuck , that 's a lot less '' . 
  and then you realise you have n't paid your `` zdrowotne '' yet !, 
  you subtract 261,73 z\u0142 and return home with 2326,97 z\u0142 , which is ~ 23 % less than you have on your umowa o prac\u0119 and at least 33 % less than the `` raw '' cost of your employment . 
  and you still have n't paid your income tax , but i 'm tired already and have no desire to count this again . 
  tax-free amount is 3091z\u0142 , up to 85 000ish z\u0142oty the tax is 18 % , above that 32 % . 
  too much taxes work for today . 
  do you have a national minimum wage ? 
  if you have a job contract ( umowa o prac\u0119 ) , 1600z\u0142 before taxes ( which costs the employer 1931,84 z\u0142 and you will see 1181,38 z\u0142 . 
  what is the history of the labor laws ? 
  i do n't feel competent enough to answer that question , but until the fall of communism the only employer had been the government . 
  what is the societal opinion of the current laws ? 
  the taxing system is hiding some of the employment costs , which should change . 
  being an entrepreneur is rather complicated . 
  are there any upcoming law changes ? 
  no major ones i am aware of . 
  what are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers ? 
  depending on location , but some of the most common in a city of ~ 800k people - telemarketing - distribution of leaflets - cleaning - direct sales - picking fruit - unpacking lorries - restocking shelves at supermarkets - harassing tourists or as some might call it advertising local clubs  12 . 
  are there common illegal work schemes ? 
  working without a written agreement is the biggest , writing very small salary on the job contract and then giving money to the hand to avoid taxes is another . 
  i 've missed your post , so i 'll cite mine here so there would n't be 2 entries :  poland here . 
   officially the white colour symbolises silver or purity , while red bravery and fighting spirit . 
   why these colours ? 
  for ages our banners had a white eagle on them , hence the white . 
  the red dye was expensive , so only the wealthiest could afford if , so it was put in the background . 
  as the polish-lithuanian commonwealth with its [ fancy banners ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/great_chor%c4%85%c5%bcy_of_the_polish_crown.jpg ) ceased to exist , someone went for something much more simple to make , so you could wear it as a band if you happened to rise against the occupants . 
  we 'd be fucked now if you were told to draw banners from xviiith century in primary school . 
  it does n't imply death penalty . 
  if you were a dictator , who would speak up about the accidental death of your opponent who happened to tie himself up and commit suicide by taking 3 rounds from ak47 in his back ? 
  or death of another one , who was unfortunate enough to trip and fall on a knife 17 times ? 
  or yet another one who tripped and impaled himself on the spire atop of the canterbury cathedral ? 
  or another one who shot himself in his back using a longbow ? 
  it 's exactly the same in poland , but young people are taking mortgages out much more often now . 
  the vikings were providing socialised healthcare to the people who lived near the shores . 
  the problem was that they cured iron deficiency using some questionable practises ... 
  but they only wanted to help !, 
  nah , that would include russia . 
  czech republic , slovakia , poland and hungary are members of [ the visegrad group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) , i hope that the cooperation between these country will be on the rise in the near future . 
  that 's called a fail . 
  mistaking some place in belarus with krak\u00f3w . 
  have you tried / r/iwantout ? 
  how many young people are getting the hell out of there ? 
  are there any official numbers ? 
  no , not really . 
  it 's probably much much older . 
  [ here 's the link to the wiki page describing the scandal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skin_hunters ) . 
  they were murdering people , not driving bodies to morgues . 
  schidler 's factory was in krak\u00f3w . 
  and still is , actually . 
  it 's a museum telling the story of krak\u00f3w 's occupation during the wwii . 
  the movie was filmed in incorrect locations - the camp was filmed in a nearby quarry , the ghetto they filmed was mostly actually the jewish district on the other side of the river ( i think they got the part when the ghetto was liquidated right , though ) . 
  the burning of bodies took place near tyniec monastery , several km from the original site . 
  the building where schindler lived was filmed right , though . 
  the concentration camp was torn down after the war , not much is left . 
  since the last year they 've been cleaning it up ( making gravel paths where the roads and squares were , removing trees ) . 
  since the wwii this district of krak\u00f3w has been neglected , a lot of shit has grown in the last 20 years . 
  it 's sad , really , because it used to be a nice green place to have a walk . 
  i wonder how homophobic are other post-warsaw-pact countries . 
  we are bad in this regard because of a lot of pseudo-catholicism ( people who by means of faith are barbarians but they are always in the first row during the mass ; look at wa\u0142\u0119sa ) . 
  not to mention the nationalists ... 
  in poland he is known to be quite narrow-minded . 
  only people from abroad are surprised by that . 
  i can imagine your police being very busy having so many criminals around, 
  i 'm eating one right now !, 
  planes and coaches , in that order . 
  driving would n't make much sense due to our cars having left-hand-side steering wheel ( they require some changes to be registrable in the uk ) . 
  not to mention them having to be taxed and insured . 
  sweet, 
  these are n't bolted in place yet . 
  then the body is driven to the hospital . 
  but they were not moving when the person died , and they would have to radio the hospital they wanted to ride to . 
  but they can only radio about patients who are alive and not the ones who have just been pronounced dead . 
  sometimes the doctors do n't pronounce people dead until they reach hospital for the very same reason . 
  while he was working as a priest and up to cardinal in krak\u00f3w his home town is wadowice , 40km south-west from krak\u00f3w . 
  it 's also known for a lot of furniture being done there . 
  ** krak\u00f3w ** apparently we are famous for cheap beer . 
  or for auschwitz being nearby . 
  on more serious note : - ~ ~ tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko , he fought for poland and when he failed he went to the usa where he designed some fortifications ~ ~ ^ ^ dumb , ^ ^ dumb ^ ^ lared - wis\u0142awa szymborska , a noblist, 
  i 've been genuinely impressed by this . 
  i wonder what his peak bac was , as he had probably been lying there for a while . 
  he should get a 50 % off at the nearest [ izba wytrze\u017awie\u0144 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sobering-up_station ), 
  that 's what he deserved for breaking a few hundred bottles of beer , bastard !, 
  ** poland ** , no particular order - [ a 40-years-old man found lying unconscious in a roadside ditch on 26th july had 13,74 per mills of alcohol in his blood and survived . 
  that 's like 69 times the legal driving limit and 3 times the lethal limit for an average person . 
  he was very pale , his pupils were n't responding to light , his brain turned out to had been a bit swelled ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/mial-we-krwi-prawie-14-promili-przezyl,345648.html ) - [ a debate about civil unions for lgbt pairs was called off ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,13460183,zastraszeni__studenci_odwoluja_debate_po_naciskach.html ) after nationalists declared that they will protest `` homosexual propaganda '' if the debate takes place ; [ they have already broken into lecturing halls during some other debates ] ( http://www.tokfm.pl/tokfm/1,103085,13433342,nzs_o_zadymie_narodowcow_na_wykladzie_srody__potepic.html ) - [ russia is going to return money from credit cards robbed from the body of andrzej przewo\u017anik , a polish historian and at the time the secretary of the council for the protection of struggle and martyrdom sites , who died in the crash of polish government plane in smole\u0144sk . 
  the investigators stated that the cards were taken off body , or pieces of body , 3 hours after the crash . 
  the policemen were ` getting rid of the beer ' for a few hours ] ( http://kontakt24.tvn24.pl/temat,kilka-godzin-sprzatali-piwo-z-autostrady,95202,html?categoryid=496 ) - there 's an ongoing discussion if the police can force the driver to undergo a bac test .

  it 's not the first display of the lack of brains by polish pseudo-fans . 
  notable examples are displaying `` jihad legia '' when playing against hapoelem tel awiw ( uefa imposed 10 000 $ fine on the club ) and fights in 2007 and 2011 in respectively vilnus and kaunas ( both incidents caused by legia pseudo-fans ) .
