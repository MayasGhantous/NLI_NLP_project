  he and also tried to scare off people with an axe ( the security opened fire and stopped his car ) was pronounced insane by the specialists . 
  i disagree . 
  it depends on what kind of resources you use to learn the language . 
  it 's imo a bit more useful for the purpose of certification , as fce/cae/cpe are quite well known here . 
  i 've been watching primarily british tv series and i ca n't understand american english very well . 
  of course there 's the accent from newcastle ... 
  sarmale are called * go\u0142\u0105bki * ( pigeons ) up here . 
  only the cabbage style is available , though . 
  it 's 2:00 and i 'm hungry . 
  i do n't eat them very often , they 're a bitch to prepare compared to schabowy . 
  but yeah , they are quite popular . 
  [ schabowy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotlet_schabowy ) i ziemniaki , basically [ schnitzel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schnitzel ) with mashed potatoes and some kind of salad . 
  usually preceded by [ ros\u00f3\u0142 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ros%c3%b3%c5%82 ) . 
  typically served on sunday , at least where i live . 
  in fast-foods it 's [ zapiekanka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zapiekanka ) and [ doener kebab ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doener_kebab ) . 
  it 's not a coincidence , it 's surely in the top 5 of tourist-heavy streets . 
  in fact so tourist-heavy that you are n't allowed to ride a bike there ( but you are allowed to cycle on grodzka street , which is arguably even more crowded ), 
  the taxis are usually hunting in stare miasto . 
  a lot of drunks in the morning , plenty of tourists . 
  there 's a lot of them , but you do n't notice it . 
  even my neighbour is a taxi driver . 
  on the other hand if someone is smart enough to find some security holes and use them during their exam i would n't mind them having a bit more points . 
  the most polish housing type i can think of are [ dworki szlacheckie with characteristic roof ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/%c5%81opuszna_-_dw%c3%b3r.jpg ) , but they are not very common . 
  i would love to see how the system performs during the exams and how many ways of exploiting the system would be found in the first year of testing . 
  that 's interesting , i 've never heard about that . 
  the polish taxi mystery ? 
  the most expensive ones are near the main square , but yeah , they are n't particularly cheap . 
  you also have to take into account that these buildings are old so they might require electrical heating ( coal is frowned upon , not without a reason ) , replacing windows . 
  parking a car can be a nightmare ( you have to pay the city a small fee and you are not guaranteed that there would be any parking spot ) . 
  people prefer buying newer , a bit more spacious flats with better infrastructure for cars . 
  it depends on where you want to travel . 
  2 years in norway , sweden , denmark , netherlands , uk ? 
  no way . 
  [ like these ones ? 
  ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/kkg2a ) very popular in older cities . 
  these ones are most likely from xvith or xviith century , but to be honest they all look the same . 
  in the mid-war period you could go to lw\u00f3w , krak\u00f3w , wilno and warsaw and see very similar kamienice . 
  in older cities [ * kamienica * ( or town house ) ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/w448u ) had been the most popular type of building up to the first half of the xxth century ( bonus castle to the right ) . 
  [ zoom this map a bit and move it around ] ( https://maps.google.pl/?ll=50.053132,19.946827&amp;spn=0.004233,0.008256&amp;t=h&amp;z=18 ) and you should see 45-degrees view . 
  as you can see they were usually arranged around some sort of small garden, 
  schengen sort of is in the context of immigration laws if you think about it . 
  survive - yes . 
  many homeless people do that every year . 
  and with plans on travelling with 10 000 $ after 2 years one would n't look any different from these homeless people . 
  it 's worth mentioning that the country one gets deported from would n't charge this person but the country they are citizen of . 
  so it 's the usa who the person will be in debt with . 
  to get a work visa you and your friend have to find an employer who can prove that no one else in the whole schengen zone can perform the job , then the employer has to spend quite a lot of money to fill some paperwork and have to prove that he can support you financially . 
  no chance for that happening if you also want to travel . 
  you wo n't get a work visa after high school . 
  citizenship , residency permit ? 
  you wo n't get citizenship unless you have ancestors in a schengen country ( rules vary by country ) or get a work permit and then be a holder of residency permit for 5 years ( again , it varies by country ) . 
  as teepr suggested you might want to spend a lot less time here , for example 3 months within schengen , then wonder off ( bosnia , serbia , montenegro , albania , kosovo , macedonia , belarus , russia , ukraine , turkey , maybe something outside of europe ? ), 
  for 3 months , and then return . 
  this way you could stay for about 9 months . 
  make sure then not to cross the schengen borders then , or you might not be let back in , or banned from entering for a few years . 
  if you get in some kind of trouble you might also end up deported ( and charged with deportation fees by the usa ) . 
  you might be able to live in poland with that for 2 years , but not very comfortably and with no money for travelling . 
  poland is one of the cheapest countries to live in , by the way . 
  edit : nope , you could n't . 
  i checked for 10 000 $ . 
  would this be legal ? 
  ca n't a person from outside the schengen stay only for 90 days out of 180 ? 
  i guess that insurance + petrol would beat 1000 # easily . 
  it might be a bit stereotypical , but the farms i 've seen ( i live nearly on the border of the 3 partitions ) fitted right in . 
  it would be a lie to say that polish culture was unaffected by 123 years of occupation by three different powers . 
  we were lucky that xixth century was the time when national identity was forged , our patriotic literature and arts thrived despite poland being divided . 
  it 's an anecdotal evidence , but to be honest you are able to tell if people 's farms were under austro-hungarian/prussian occupation or under russian during the partitions of poland just by driving past some of them . 
  the ones which used to be under german-speaking occupants tend to be a bit more organised and cleaner in general than these which were under russian occupation . 
  it might be just that my family is divided in such distinctive groups , but it is still very shocking to come from one farm to another for example during the all saint 's day . 
  the number of cyclists depends on many factors , like climate , infrastructure , flatness , local transport politics , distance required to reach destination , cycling culture . 
  there was a topic recently about that . 
  the problem here in poland is usually a combination of above . 
  [ poland ] ( http://www.research-pmr.com/pl/userfiles/file/wp/wp_33_511_2013_01_23%20-%20samoch%c3%b3d%20najpopularniejszym%20%c5%9brodkiem%20transportu%20w%20dojazdach%20do%20pracy%20-%2002.pdf ) , a fresh study ( january 2013 ) , unfortunately there is no information whatsoever about their methodology and sample size . 
  the study is about commuting , not about using transport in general . 
  - bike 6 % - car 58 % - public transport 27 % - by foot 14 % it adds up to more than 100 % , but again , there was no methodology description . 
  especially combined with a rather small population . 
  your nick is also quite suspicious . 
  i think that we should also standardise things an bit - having a index is a good thing , this way the series can be put on the sidebar ( with approval of moderators of course ), 
  we coming back home , leaving moneys here . 
  i think that you 're right , mock the week is too political for my tastes . 
  i 've never watched whose line so i ca n't really compare these quality-wise . 
  it seems like you 're right .
