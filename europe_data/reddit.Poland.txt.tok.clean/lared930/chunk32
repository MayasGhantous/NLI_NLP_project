  but i still think that for the purpose of this topic news-centric topics would suit a bit better , it might become a series this way . 
  is n't it equivalent of [ the stand-ups in mock the week ( a british tv show ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bekemio-ctm ) ? 
  they also do [ news reels ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spoxzzaxudi ) . 
  they are of course uk-centric , but still . 
  we call them trampki !, 
  upon further investigation it turns out to be an urban myth . 
  i was told that when i was 10 . 
  their alcohol is expensive so they make booze trips to estonia . 
  there is a brand of w\u00f3dka called ` finlandia ' , the clear version is ok but the fruity ones are awful ( or maybe i dislike fruit-flavoured w\u00f3dka in general , hard to say ) . 
  their language is incomprehensible . 
  they went to war with russia , russia lost . 
  snow and reindeer . 
  looks like a ball sack when drawn with sweden . 
  similar in size to poland , but scarcely populated . 
  a lot of lakes . 
  nokia ~ ~ they banned donald the duck because he did n't have any pants on . ~ ~ turns out to be an urban legend saunas . 
  actually ` gospodzin ' in xivth century meant ` god ' , but i had to check it . 
  you were very close , as gospodzin means ~ gospodarz \u015bwiata ( of the world ) . 
  does lengyel ring a bell ? 
  i am not sure about this one , but in ma\u0142opolska , a region in southern poland , * kiecka * means * dress *, 
  i 'd say that it might be unfortunately known a little bit better than the polish anthem . 
  it might be very hard to spot a closeted gay ; i know a man who you would have said was anything but gay , he came out very late at life , a few months before defending his master 's thesis . 
  the pressure of the society and self-denial caused by it can be very hard to overcome . 
  same on the other side of lithuania , but we use * powie\u015b\u0107 * , not * rom\u0101ns *, 
  just boycotting the olympic games would n't make any difference to the russian law . 
  homophobia is also a cultural thing , and i do n't think that if there was a nation-wide referendum about decriminalizing ` homosexual propaganda ' they would vote in favour of the lgbt community . 
  there are many other ways russia can be reprimanded ( which i think would do just as much as boycotting - nothing ) , using political channels . 
  what you and stephen fry is trying to make is using athletes as a political tool , against their wishes . 
  russia is still deeply rooted in the era of tzars , and it is going to take many , many years to change behaviour of their government . 
  some western countries boycotted the games in 1980 , in return olympic games in 1984 were boycotted by the warsaw pact . 
  i had to actually look up the reasons of boycotts because the games in 1984 are remembered as the ones the government ruined for our athletes . 
  why should the athletes who have been preparing for years to participate in the olympics ( and they might not have another opportunity to participate in any , as the ageing has a serious impact on their performance and the next olympic games are 4 years later ) give up because of a political and social scandal ? 
  they are interested in competing , they probably do n't give a single fuck where they are going to do this unless it could result in them being imprisoned/injured , which would be a scandal russia is rather not going to participate in . 
  has any of them , without external pressure , decided to boycott the olympic games ? 
  it 's a very / r/asoiaf-heavy topic for / r/europe, 
  you know nothing , alltat the swede, 
  the problem is that we share words but not necesarily the meaning , look at `` szuka\u0107 drogi '' in polish and czech for example . 
  stopa means ` foot ' in polish . 
  ` korak ' is similar to ` krok ' - a step , but only a step a person can make , like a step forward , not an element of stairs . 
  odciepljenje also sounds like ` de-warming ' , od-cieplenie . 
  ` odcjepljenje ' sounds a bit like polish ` odczepienie ' ( separation from something ) . 
  ` uzastopnost ' might be a very distant cousin of ` nast\u0119pstwo ' ( succession , which is a distant cousin of stopie\u0144 - ` step ' ( like in stairs ) ), 
  what are the croatian equivalents ? 
  in polish secession and succession are also very similar . 
  they are derivatives of latin words , so they are probably rather common in europe . 
  yes , especially these in poland . 
  there are n't any . 
  in the uk one was converted into a tesco iirc . 
  before war there were at least 90 active synagogues , not there are 2 active ones , but only one has frequent masses ( i do n't know how jews call them ), 
  you can go through kazimierz ( jewish district , used to be a separate city ) , then on the other side of the river you have jewish ghetto , schindler factory , then if you go a bit further ( not many tourists do because the germans levelled the camp before retreating ) you can get to a concentration camp . 
  i 've seen orthodox jews only a few times despite living nearby . 
  and i am not even sure if they were polish jews or tourists . 
  we have been trying people who murdered and tortured people during the stalinist regime . 
  these people are so old ( 90 + ) that any sentence is life imprisonment for them . 
  it 's good to see that at least some of them will see justice in their lifetime . 
  in poland the most wanted people for security are disabled people because they are subsidised . 
  for seasonal jobs people with a status of students are preferable because they do n't have to pay for insurance and can get paid less . 
  of course in both types of jobs they offer you a contract which does n't give you rights like days off , minimum wage etc. 
  how the hell do you choose 200 people from 28 000 ? 
  do you randomly pick 20 000 applications and throw them away , because the people whose applications were chosen are clearly unlucky and you do n't want unlucky people to work for you ? 
  hr nightmare . 
  is this a reference to something ? 
  i 've seen it before . 
  we can still steal your bmw if you ask nicely ... 
  it is obliged to join the eurozone , but the treaty of accession does n't specify a date . 
  it only specifies that if poland fulfils some requirements , it has to join the eurozone . 
  and we are n't exactly in hurry . 
  it 's funny that people here emigrated to ireland for the very same reason - they did n't have money . 
  everyone knows that there 's no europe beyond the eastern border of germany . 
  you 've been awarded 0,7 l of w\u00f3dka . 
  ukraine has 30 % population which speaks russian as its first language . 
  are they all foreign citizens though ? 
  at tandeta in krak\u00f3w you have lots of them , but some of them are actually second generation . 
  to be honest i would love to meet one of these 57 000 people who were so desperate they chose to live in poland . 
  we are n't eastern europe !, 
  no w\u00d3dka for you !, 
  nobody wants to be in the same part of europe russia is ... 
  nobody likes poland :(, 
  does anyone know which countries the train passes through ? 
  i do n't think that was his point ... 
  well for you and some other people it might be just so obvious fact that you do n't consider it a news . 
  that 's why i have a . txt file on my desktop and whenever i hear something worth posting i write it down . 
  then i add some links and wait for this topic to show up . 
  ** poland ** - the 69th anniversary of [ the warsaw uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) ( do n't mix it up with [ the warsaw ghetto uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto_uprising ) ) hands down the event of the week . 
  [ here 's a video of what happens in warsaw at the ` w ' hour on 01.08 every year ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejd2rsxoqsi ) two veterans who lived through the fights asked people to leave their political preferences to themselves and not to express them on the cemetery . 
  despite of that on the cemetery of the people who died in the uprising some people booed the politicians from the political party they did n't like . 
  i am not saying that these people who were booed are saints , but on a cemetery ? 
  really ? 
  after the ceremonies on the cemetery an mp told that if the prime minister , the president and the president of warsaw ( who are member of the opposing party ) do n't want to get booed , they should n't show up at the ceremonies . 
  he also claimed that what other people think about it does n't matter as his mother was a medic during the uprising , hence what he says is somehow more important . 
  ( i am sorry for being so subjective , but for fucks sake ... ) - other people discuss ( not on a cemetery and in a more civilised way ) if the uprising had any chance of success or if its cost was n't too high for the benefits it could gain . 
  most people agree that what these people did was heroic and they deserve great respect for it . 
  - the pope is going to visit krak\u00f3w in 2016 to lead [ the world youth day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_youth_day ) . 
  no surprise here , [ john paul ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_paul_ii ) whose career as a priest started in the city during the wwii was also the person who initiated the world youth day in 1984 . 
  - tour de pologne started in france and then continued in southern poland . 
  it ended on saturday . 
  - there were thunderstorms all over poland . 
  local floodings , hailstorms , fallen trees . 
  and it 's hot again now ( up to 35 degrees ) . 
  - a lot of people died on roads contributing to poland being one of the countries with the biggest rate of road fatalities in europe - the military police secured a few hundred litres of w\u00f3dka on a plane which was meant to transport soldiers of polish special forces to afghanistan .
