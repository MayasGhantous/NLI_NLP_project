  morale of the polish contingent plummets . 
  - we dug out some more wwii explosives . 
  our military engineers have been busy lately . 
  - about 450 000 people had fun at [ woodstock festival at kostrzyn nad odr\u0105 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/przystanek_woodstock ) . 
  the festival is organised by one of the most widely known charity fundations in poland , [ great orchestra of christmas charity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_orchestra_of_christmas_charity ) . 
  each year they set a target , like ` saving the lives of children and probiding adequate healthcare for the elderly ' ( 2013 ) or ` prevention and early diagnosis of cancer in children ' ( 2009,2010 ) and collect money all over the poland with help of volunteers . 
  they usually help children by buying medical equipment and then letting hospitals using it free of charge . 
  the festival is meant to be a big thank you for the volunteers and you do n't have to pay anything to participate . 
  a lot of germans attend it because [ it 's right by the border with germany , relatively close to berlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kostrzyn_nad_odr%c4%85 ) . 
  - yet another man with illegal firearms and explosives was arrested in krak\u00f3w . 
  he is connected with the case of brunon k. , who was most likely preparing a terrorist attack against the parliament . 
  - we had the first pregnancy as a direct effect of this year in vitro subsidies - [ a 6-years-old boy hit a tree while driving his drunk father home . 
  ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-6-latek-wiozl-pijanego-ojca-samochodem,nid,1005364 ) - we had a country-wide failure of ewu\u015a system ( it allows checking if a patient is insured ) . 
  it was down for nearly half a day . 
  - the heart of a man who had been waiting 650 days for a heart transplant apparently got better . 
  he left the hospital a few days ago . 
  - 70th anniversary of the mutiny in treblinka concentration camp . 
  200 out of 800 prisoners who took part in the mutiny managed to escape and about 100 lived to the end of the war . 
  also why would they ` punish ' russian companies for what the russian government has done ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  also , why w\u00f3dka ? 
  the russians are happy because there 's more left for them !, 
  you should add ~ 6 hours to your local time , so posting it ~ 12:00 of your local time should be fine ( it would be 17:00 -19:00 in most of europe ), 
  evenings should do the trick on weekends . 
  in the week i suggest posting in the morning ( 6-7 gmt +1 , as most people i know warm up by reading the news and surfing reddit ) . 
  if you want to target americans i 've noticed that just after 23:00 gmt +0 is ok . 
  the posts tend not to sink to the bottom of the page . 
  a bit off-topic - i suggest trying to avoid posting series , especially new ones , at 1:07 ( gmt +1 which most of the europe uses or 2:07 in romania ) . 
  the algorithm reddit uses will most likely push the post down the `` hot '' list because not many people would upvote or submit responses . 
  does a mp make just as much money as the pm in germany ? 
  we can send you some alcoholics , they will sober up the moment they see these prices . 
  what 's the price difference of alcohol between estonia and finland ? 
  let 's say we are talking about comparable beers and w\u00f3dka . 
  they might not know the exact dates and the number of casualties , but are aware what it was about . 
  yeah i am not saying that they are not being built , but some of them are not being built on time , for various reasons . 
  it seems like it is !, 
  i 've been convinced that it 's not for the last 3 years . 
  i must have misunderstood something . 
  edit : i actually mistook it for eurail , which does n't offer poland in its global pass . 
  if it 's going to work out just like motorways on euro 2012 then i wo n't live long enough to have a ride . 
  they 've finished a stretch of motorway which was meant to be ready for euro 2012 a week ago . 
  nor is poland . 
  given the mess in our rail companies ( pkp right rail , pkp left rail , pkp gravel etc. 
  a few years ago a man was killed because they could n't figure out whose a passage over a railway was and nobody wanted to repair it . 
  the body ended up nearly incinerated on the traction lines ), 
  he did !, 
  how could i have not noticed ? 
  now he has to be a herring . 
  if he trims his moustache correctly he can pretend to be a catfish himself . 
  once in a while various pieces of art stolen by nazis or soviets pop up on auctions , and it 's not that unusual either . 
  some collectors go to great lengths to enlarge their collections , look for example for people who ordered `` arbeit macht frei '' inscription to be stolen . 
  it was destroyed in the process . 
  it 's like a middle-school cock length contest . 
  we are not all working in construction , plumbing , picking fruit and stealing cars . 
  some of us are unemployed !, 
  bloody immigrants , eh ? 
  land of passion ? 
  [ explain !, 
  explain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlprblkgcbo ), 
  well there is no potato on the coins . 
  it would be weird if there were any , would n't it ? 
  perfectly latvian coins . 
  for the eurozone redditors - where were coins in your wallets/piggies minted ? 
  where do you live ? 
  well you can find a lot of this type of people in poland . 
  visit wykop.pl sometomes , but sit down first . 
  muslims are bad ( although they have n't seen one in their life ) , gay propaganda is bad , government is bad , police is just pure evil ( `` the fuckers enforce the law !? 
  how dare they !, 
  '' ) , the list can go on and on . 
  i guess that moral cost would still be a lot higher than in most hotels ;p, 
  they might be a bit popular in former polish-lithuanian commonwealth territories ( poland , lithuania , belarus , ukraine , parts of russia ) [ pierogi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi ) [ bigos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos ) [ \u017bur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbur ) [ kapu\u015bniak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapusniak ) [ zapiekanka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zapiekanka ) . 
  very popular fast food . 
  [ barszcz or however others call it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barszcz ) [ cucumber soup is also good . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cucumber_soup ) pickled cucumbers ( the polish kind ) with rice and potatoes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_pancake ) they are n't exactly rare but rather specific to region . 
  it 's bloody 2:30 and i am starving ... 
  i am wondering when you will be able to tip the stripper with a credit cards . 
  sliding card between the titties ? 
  buttcrack ? 
  you see wydymany has multiple meanings . 
  one of them is fucked , the other is tricked or outwitted . 
  do n't underestimate the power of polish swear words . 
  wydymany actually has much more meaning to it than gangbanged . 
  you see we also have izby parlamentu , and in the uk there are parliament chambers . 
  but well , even if you live in a hut , zastaw si\u0119 , a postaw si\u0119 !, 
  i 've just checked it . 
  i think they closed one in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a . 
  in krak\u00f3w there is still one at rozrywka street ( entertainment street ;d ) right by the fence of batowicki cemetery , in case you took `` zaliczy\u0107 zgona '' a bit to seriously . 
  wow , that 's the first list like that i see where europe does n't end at prague . 
  we would probably just use `` wydymany '' , a fancy way to say fucked . 
  well a woman drowned when she did get wasted in kostrzyn nad odr\u0105 last week , so preferably away from big bodies of deep water . 
  warsaw uprising will be the main topic of the week in poland . 
  just as every year since the uprising itself . 
  there are people who think that there were reasons for uprising to take place , and there are these who think it was pointless and only contributed to huge losses in people and buildings . 
  there are no izba wytrze\u017awie\u0144s in the countryside . 
  there was some topic on reddit where a man fell asleep drunk in the uk i think and woke up in gdynia . 
  edit : [ here you go !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/xtnbl/whats_the_wierdest_scenario_you_have_ever_woken/c5phs5x?context=3 ), 
  in polish it 's more like `` sobering-up chamber '' . 
  but i think it implies a bit more than 3 parties .
