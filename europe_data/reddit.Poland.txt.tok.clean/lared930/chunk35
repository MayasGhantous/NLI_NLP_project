  - the police have miraculously solved a 21-years-old crime - a murder - by using the newest technology advancements ( no details i 'm afraid ) - a man who committed a murder 10 years ago was caught by the same unit as the man above ( `` archive x '' ) - a 26-years-old man who called numerous institutions including hospitals telling them there were bombs on their premises was arrested . 
  - our statistics office wants to count the prostitutes - the number of storks in poland is plummeting for unknown reasons - a man admitted to a murder he committed 20 years ago - a man with 7kg of amphetamine was arrested - a man went to a police station , admitted to drunk-driving and then promptly escaped th police station by climbing out of the window . 
  - a wwii grenade was found in a park that 's about it , i guess, 
  a while ago there was a popular joke :  dear germans !, 
  please visit poland , your cars are already here !, 
  i do n't think that many people here know how checks work or how to handle them , let alone use them . 
  in poland you have to have your id ( after you are 18 , you can also get one earlier if you want to ) , not necessarily on you . 
  you can put it anywhere you want , as long as you can get it in a reasonable amount of time . 
  you also do n't have to pay for your first one . 
  it 's true that you have to remember its number though . 
  this is a shitty article . 
  yes , eu is twice smaller than the usa , but europe is not . 
  now imagine text-only quiz where you are given a name of a country , say hungary , and have to write down the neighbouring countries . 
  there is a publicly-available database containing basic informations about virtually every single small village in poland . 
  the bot just posted it to wikipedia . 
  i can only thin about [ herr flick ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=smfk5bg3jsa&amp;t=227 ) while reading this post . 
  so in the countries where people were oppressed or murdered due to the specific of implementations of these ideologies . 
  any sources on the 70 % figure ? 
  preferably with actual methodology of collecting the data , please . 
  there were 7,549 children named with different variations of name muhammad ( in england and wales ) . 
  there were also 723,913 live births there , so we are looking at 1,04 % of children . 
  in 2011 muslims were about 4.8 % of population . 
  it means that statistically speaking about 3/4th of the muslim population chooses some other name , i am going to guess that it 's mostly `` european '' one . 
  at least it does n't include san marino , monaco , liechtenstein , luxembourg , or andorra . 
  but i have to admit that different size scales can piss one off . 
  the hardest quiz i 've played on the political map of europe was naming the neighbouring countries . 
  [ this one is a bit harder then the posted one ] ( http://www.purposegames.com/game/2e0761c852 ), 
  bots , maybe ? 
  writing one could be a bit tricky but certainly not impossible . 
  it 's less than one second for each country . 
  unlikely . 
  by the way why do you prefer the spanish one ? 
  there 's really no difference if you wo n't live there or do n't know the language . 
  azerbaijan , armenia , israel and georgia are countries which are associated within european olympic committees , but are not usually referred to as european countries . 
  there was n't one an hour ago . 
  they must block them depending on the amount of views apparently . 
  [ a free version from the ministry of foreign affairs of poland ( polish embassy in london , actually ) ] ( http://londyn.msz.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/artykul__seven_eu_myths_you_should_never_believe ), 
   even your cooking has improved . 
  false , it 's immigrants ' cooking ;p, 
  i guess that vatican is slightly worse . 
  not much space to build . 
  in poland the catholic church uses a very stupid way to measure religiousness - there 's one mass in the year when they count how many people have came . 
  of course they advertise it for a month before ( they sometimes even leave leaflets in the postboxes ) . 
  apparently only ~ 40 % of declared catholics attends these masses . 
  do you have any ancestors from europe ? 
  citizenship is * usually * passed by blood and with an eu passport it 's only a matter of moving , finding a job and learning the language , in whichever order you wish . 
  in order to get a passport * most of the time * you have to prove that there exists a continuous line of ancestry up to the one who left europe . 
  of course there are numerous limitations and each country has its own rules , for example fighting in a war or being a civil servant abroad could have automatically revoked citizenship . 
  i guess it was cheaper than dubbing and better for uneducated people , as some of them could n't read fast enough . 
  we also have seatbelts in newer couches , but [ these buses ] ( http://images.wikia.com/warszawa/images/3/3c/trakt_lubelski_ ( autobus_147 \\ ) . jpg ) , they look [ roughly like that on the inside ( yes , i know it 's a tram ) ] ( http://www.km-forum.com.pl/galeria/data/media/4093/krk_mpk_20532.jpg ), 
  you see , all the parts which are now in italics were written incorrectly in the original post . 
  i 've edited it at least twice or thrice . 
  i 've found out that i can ` tune ' my throat to english if i keep using it for a whole day ( usually repeating some silly lines from some tv series ) . 
  you can feel the change , it hurts a bit , but you can certainly speak a bit more clearly for a few hours . 
  english uses voices so different than polish that i ca n't pronounce some of them without a warm-up . 
  i think that for an observer it can sound [ like that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9ewvcyxzs ) . 
  and i have to watch myself so that i wo n't spit when pronouncing some consonants , like the ` t ' in sport . 
  to be honest i ca n't hear any difference between those two . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/open-mid_back_rounded_vowel.ogg ) and [ here 's another ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/open_back_rounded_vowel.ogg ) . 
  at first i thought that i had accidentally opened the same link twice . 
  one of the words things for me is writing down spelled words . 
  english ` e ' is spelled exactly as polish ` i ' , and i always write down ` i ' . 
  native speakers tend to write words just like they would pronounce them . 
  in poland you spend the better part of your time during polish language lessons learning rules why you write `` rzeka '' and not '' \u017ceka '' despite them being pronounced exactly the same in modern polish . 
  there are multiple sounds that can be written differently , for example : rz - \u017c ch - h \u00f3 - u there was a subtle difference between them , not more than 100 years ago , but it 's gone now . 
  in ipa there is absolutely no difference between those , but if you switched them you would be seen as uneducated idiot . 
  the same thing is happening to the native english speakers . 
  could 've sounds roughly the same as could of , it 's is similar to its . 
  you 've got spelling bees , while polish is read just as it 's written so we have `` dyktanda '' , during which someone reads text with some of the unusual words and you have to write it down correctly remembering about the rules above . 
  they work on the same principle - sounds can be written differently . 
  actually i do n't know anyone who would n't bitch about pronunciation of english words , regardless of their mother tongue . 
  but i agree that there are languages whose speakers have it harder than the speakers of others ( japanese would be one from the harder group , i guess ) . 
  there are n't any seatbelts in buses either . 
  hence the low usage rate ... 
  poland here . 
  there are two ways to learn english here : the first one is self - * studying * . 
  basing on my observations i can say that only about 30-40 % of students try to learn more than what they are taught at school . 
  i 've been learning english basically since i got my first computer . 
  i was about seven at the time and the internet has been so far the best source for learning english . 
  i 've noticed that it allows to build up quite a lot of passive vocabulary . 
  the passive vocabulary , as opposed to the active vocabulary , is basically a set of words , idioms , phrasal verbs and others i can understand when listening or reading , but which i would n't usually use while writing or speaking . 
  when i discovered reddit not that long time ago i could understand almost everything , but even now i tend to forget some basic vocabulary ( i do n't write a lot , so that 's the problem ) the problem with learning how to listen to english in poland is that on the telly we tend to use `` lektor '' - a voice-over , so you ca n't really listen to the original content . 
  it sucks and i do n't think it * is going to * change any time soon , but at least now you can turn this shit off most of the time . 
  in order to catch up with listening skills i 've been watching various * tv series * , usually british ( because all the standardised tests and about 90 % of * the * textbooks * here * uses british english ) like blackadder , doctor who , spaced , black books etc. 
  the problem with learning using the methods above is that you suck at creating english text , especially at grammar - i 've forced myself to * solve * quite a lot grammar exercises ( english grammar in use by raymond murphy , quite a handy book ) with , as you can clearly see by reading this post , mediocre results . 
  i still ca n't find a good way to extend my active vocabulary . 
  the main problem with learning english for me is speaking . 
  english has shitty pronunciation rules , with even more shittier exceptions . 
  not to mention that it has some sounds which make it very hard for me to , for example , say `` three '' without it sounding like `` tree '' or `` free '' . 
  i do n't have time nor can i afford lessons with a native speaker . 
  none of the english teachers i 've met was a native speaker . 
  with * the learning process described above * i 've been able , with some help from school , to achieve level comparable with b2 , but it 's still more of b1 than c1 . 
  the second way to learn english , and by far the most popular , is learning it at school . 
  nowadays english is taught from kindergarten up ( including phd ) . 
  if you want to get a phd you are expected to be able to communicate at at least c1 level in a language of your choice , which is in almost every instance english . 
  every person who wants to get matura certificate ( something like gces and a-levels ) has to know english ( or other language of their choice ) at at least b1 level . 
  a decade ago you had to learn the first foreign language only since you were ~ 10 . 
  most people receive the mandatory education and then go to some sort of university and get a bachelor 's or master 's degree , so the kids now are looking for at least 12 years of learning english . 
  how is it taught ? 
  slowly and depending on the teacher 's ambitions and of course the pupils .
