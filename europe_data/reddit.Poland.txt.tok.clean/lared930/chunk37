  i can remember my city before 2004 . 
  there used to be car radios thefts , broken windows etc. 
  between may 2004 and 2005 most of the local chavs suddenly disappeared and the crime rates plummeted . 
  not a single car radio theft in my neighbourhood since we joined the eu . 
  is there really a need for the survey to be open for a whole month ? 
  i 've nearly forgotten that it takes place . 
  are people still filling it out after such a long time since its creation ? 
  maybe i 've only bumped into a few nasty guys . 
  it was a one-time accident , but very unpleasant . 
  i think that `` the ukraine '' was used to describe it as one of the soviet republics . 
  it feels like there is a divide - some parts of the country are pro-russian , the others are pro-western . 
  corrupt police . 
  the roads are worse than the polish ones , and that 's a notable achievement . 
  they use some weird train tracks , so at the border they have to lift toe cars and replace the thingies with wheels . 
  the language is mixed russian and polish . 
  we ca n't read it though as they use cyrillic . 
  their population is decreasing in an alarming rate . 
  they seem to have quite unstable politics and economy . 
  they do/used to manufacture air planes ( antonovs ) . 
  some of them do n't like polish tourists and like to yell obscenities , especially in lviv . 
  for a third of population russian is their native language . 
  it 's similar on the other side of the oder . 
  you can tell that for example `` bronis\u0142aw komorowski is [ insert an insult ] '' ( he can sue you of course , but it 's not ex officio ) , but saying `` president bronis\u0142aw komorowski is [ insert an insult ] '' is illegal and carries probably the same punishment . 
  ... depending on the time zone . 
  sek is the currency of sweden . 
  the only countries starting with a with euro are austria and andorra as far as i can remember . 
  judging by the prices the trousers are shipped from china , arrive at a port in germany and then are shipped abroad . 
  that 's also a problem , but i do n't think that it justifies slitting throats of unstunned animals . 
  well i guess that they are the ones that people forget about when talking about muslims . 
  to be honest i do n't think that the people talking rather unkindly of muslims have seen or been around any of them . 
  the discussion is about the rights of animals , not about jews or muslims . 
  and by the way the ~ ~ only ~ ~ majority of muslims you are going to find in poland have been living here for quite some time , i 'm talking about [ tatars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) . 
  they can probably trace their roots in poland much further than these who want them out . 
  i 'm aware that there are no minefields in the city , but i 've heard that despite efforts there are still some minefields in the woods of eastern croatia and probably in bosnia . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  well that 's an important factor too . 
  maybe because it has something to do with moving more as a tourist ? 
  are n't there still some minefields around ? 
  [ nah , we killed the fuckers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawel_dragon ) . 
  they were eating our virgins , hence no virgin mary in poland . 
  because inverted indonesian flag !, 
  can you imagine these tourist struggling to pronounce `` pies ci\u0119 jeba\u0142 '' to an incompetent guide ? 
  we call a car like that ` kombi ' in poland . 
  i have no idea why , however . 
  oh yeah , the second stage of invasion - introducing polish language - is about to begin . 
  pierdoli\u0107 has exactly the same meaning as jebat ' . 
  it 's amazing that i can understand all your swear words except for kokot . 
  do you have any interesting swear phrases ? 
  something like : z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142e\u015b - you 've swapped heads with your own dick ( about someone crazy ) pies go/to jeba\u0142 - he/it was fucked by a dog ( about something you do n't care about ) g\u0142upszy ni\u017c ustawa przewiduje - more stupid that the law had expected ( about someone who is dumb ) id\u017a pan w chuj - go to the dick ( means fuck off ), 
  also worth mentioning : z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142e\u015b - you 've swapped heads with your own dick ( about someone crazy ) pies go/to jeba\u0142 - he/it was fucked by a dog ( about something you do n't care about ) g\u0142upszy ni\u017c ustawa przewiduje - more stupid that the law had expected ( about someone who is dumb ), 
  in polish i think that ` the best ' means the most universal . 
  look for example for word `` pierdoli\u0107 '' , which means ` fuck ' . 
  [ depending on the prefix , it can have wide range of applications . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jayu1.jpg ) . 
  similarly you can use word ` jeba\u0107 ' , which also means to fuck . 
  most of the time the same prefix will give the two words the same meaning . 
  you can also use prefixes with word `` kurwi\u0107 '' - to be a whore , but it 's considered even more vulgar than jeba\u0107 , which is in general slightly more vulgar than pierdoli\u0107 . 
  here 's a handy list of swear words : | po polsku | po angielsku | | : ----------- | : ------------ | | kurwa | literally ` whore ' , used as english fuck , but see also :| | kurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be a whore | | wkurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be pissed off | | nakurwi\u0107 si\u0119 | to be drunk | | przykurwi\u0107 , zakurwi\u0107 | to hit someone | | nakurwi\u0107 | to beat someone up | | pierdoli\u0107 | literally ` to fuck ' , means ` to fuck ' or ` to talk nonsense ' but see also :| | * od * pierdoli\u0107 | to snap off , for example ` odpierdol\u0119 ci g\u0142ow\u0119 pierdolony chuju ' - i 'll decapitate you , you dick . | | * do * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up , to make something fail | | * w * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * s * pierdoli\u0107 | to fail at something , but also to run away , destroy something | | * na * pierdoli\u0107 | to beat someone up | | * przy * pierdoli\u0107 | to hit someone | | * za * pierdoli\u0107 | to kill someone , but also to steal something | | * pod * pierdoli\u0107 | to steal something or to report someone 's bad deeds to the police | | * o * pierdoli\u0107 | to tell someone off | | jeba\u0107 | same as pierdoli\u0107 | | chuj , kutas | very vulgar way to say dick , but see also :| | chujowy ( adj. ), 
  | bad , poor , feeble something | | chujnia ( noun ) | same as above | | cipa , pizda | very vulgar word for vagina | | skurwysyn | son of a bitch | | matkojebca | literally motherfucker | | cwel | vulgar for gay or someone raped in prison on daily basis | | pierdol si\u0119 | fuck you | | jeb si\u0119 | fuck you | | spierdalaj | fuck off | | kurwa ( ma\u0107 ) | fuck | | upierdol\u0119 ci g\u0142ow\u0119 | i 'll chop your head off ( but literally `` i 'll fuck your head off !, 
  '' ) | | zajebi\u0119 ci\u0119 | i 'll kill you ( but literally `` i 'll fuck you to death !, 
  '' ) | and many more . 
  some of these words are used more or less frequently depending on the context . 
  for example . 
  if someone comes up with a crazy idea , you can say that he is `` popierdolony '' , `` pojebany '' or that he `` ocipia\u0142 '' , or , my favourite , `` z chujem si\u0119 na g\u0142owy pozamienia\u0142 '' ( he swapped heads with his own dick ), 
  i seem to have missed the jesus statues ones . 
  any stories ? 
  that would make some sense . 
  in most slavic languages it 's just some sort of `` black mountain '' . 
  does anybody know why is montenegro called so ? 
  why was crna gora translated ? 
  werther the greatest literary figure in the european literature according to the poles ? 
  he could n't even shoot himself in his head properly !, 
  i wo n't even comment the adam mickiewicz one . 
  well i think that we should n't feed the troll . 
  let me cite some of his comments :  americans have to work more hours simply due to the fact that they are much dumber than your average european . 
  it 's sad , but that 's the truth . . -------------  arrested development was too smart of a show for dumb americans . 
  they need shows like two 1/2 men and big bang theory that contains cheap laughs . 
  i do n't know why americans are so bloody stupid . 
  -------------  just a secure area where the most evil country in the world tests new weapons that they spend billions of dollars on instead of trying to fix their 3rd world country . 
  -------------  well . . we are more intelligent than americans , so it 's not really surprising that we have more atheists . 
  i think that it should give the general idea . 
  poland : polish english french but on page 4 there are translations of the fields in numerous languages , most of which i ca n't recognise . 
  for example `` name '' ( i 'm going to use only latin alphabet symbols ) : prijmeni/efternavn/perekunnanimi / sukunimi / [ greek ] / aoekkudis/naam/pavarde / uzvards/kunjom/name / apelido/priezvisko/priimek / efternamn/cognome/csaladi nev first name : jmeno/fornavne/eesnimed / etunimet / [ greek ] / nombre/voornamen/vardai / vardi/isem/vornamen / nome proprio/meno/ime / fornamn/nome/utonevek so i guess : czech/danish/estonian / finnish/greek/spanish / dutch/lithuanian/latvian / maltese/german/portuguese / slovak/slovenian/swedish / italian/hungarian which , including english , french and polish are the languages spoken in the eu in 2007 with exception for bulgarian and romanian . 
  the passport was issued on this day in 2007 . 
  it is relatively new , the users are mostly the same as there were some problems with moderators on wykop , and they just switched to strims . 
  both sites are right-wing . 
  actually they use adjective `` left-wing '' as an insult . 
  i prefer strims because just as with reddit , you can block off these subreddits you do n't like . 
  no , that 's not reddit 's clone . 
  neither technologically , nor ideologically . 
  it 's digg clone . 
  [ strims ] ( http://strims.pl/ ) is similar technology-wise . 
  i 've summed up what the content of wykop is a while ago : - bashing the government and politicians whenever they can - hating jews and muslims - hating gypsies - anti-gay - pro-gun - anti religion ( but for a while more pro-catholic , i do n't know why ) - somewhere in between the above - nice videos , usually history-related or some startups , bits from reddit it 's been especially bad after the school year ended , but now they slowly return to reality . 
  it 's something like / r/worldnews with additional hate against gays and the government . 
  some people just wo n't admit it . 
  which language was the welcome in 0:14 in ? 
  you underestimate the british . 
  they have much more daily experience with tea spoons . 
  try not queuing or calling a scotsman english . 
  given this logic i should be jailed because i can potentially disembowel people using a tea spoon . 
  in a while i might get letters demanding payment from various companies because i might have potentially pirated their games .
