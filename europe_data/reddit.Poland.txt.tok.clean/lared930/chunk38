  probably they also count some foreign alcohols , like whiskey/whisky/whatever . 
  i can get 2-3 bottles of good w\u00f3dka for the price of 1 good bottle of foreign spirit . 
  the prices are comparable to a bottle of good mead . 
  a teenager doing some menial job full time for a month during holidays can afford 1/2 of a gaming computer or 10-15 bottles of foreign alcohol . 
  a pack of fags costs 9-12z\u0142 , which is half of bottle of vodka . 
  it 's astonishing how similar it is here . 
  i see that you 've adapted the polish method . 
  do n't forget that the first contractor will go bankrupt somewhere in the middle . 
  i understood that , and tried to agree . 
  my communication skills suck . 
  it is weird , yes , but wrong ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it makes no harm . 
  why was it posted in / r/europe ? 
  ask the op . 
  i like this one , they make 30m + long ones in one village ( lipnica murowana ? ) . 
  they should hire some engineers . 
  this custom has been known in poland since the medieval times . 
  they do n't usually interfere with local customs , such as this one . 
  it 's only done in a few parishes in kaszuby , it 's not like they are burning crosses or something . 
  if you searched for weird religious customs you could find more of these . 
  if you asked a pole about this custom , 99 % of time he would have no idea what you are talking about . 
  it 's some kind of 350 years-old very localised custom of moving `` feretron '' ( a double-sided holy image with these handles for 4 people ) in a very specific way , for example making a cross sign , rotating it , ` bowing ' to small chapels . 
  it 's unlikely to be of a pagan origin , but you have to admit that quite a long time ago someone was bored and invented something quite creative . 
  it 's just a weird example of local traditions . 
  i can only imagine that sending a rocket/shuttle from the moon to croatia is going to be quite a bit expensive . 
  shit , we should make charts with what constitutes western/northern/southern / eastern europe for each country and add a hyperlink them to the flairs . 
  i 've been living in one of the most touristy cities in poland end every time i saw a foreigner i thought `` why did you come here , you fool !, 
  there 's nothing interesting in here ! '' . 
  then i realised that i could spend a week non-stop in various museums and exhibitions and there still would be something else to see . 
  and what about holidays ? 
  it ~ ~ costs ~ ~ * would cost * a fortune to travel even to a god-damned croatia !, 
  edit : shitty grammar, 
  no shit . 
  in poland potatoes sell in bulk for ~ 20 % of their retail price . 
  even given all the costs in between 400 % price rise is a bit too much . 
  some farmers even opened their own shops and sell their produce for 40-70 % of the supermarket prices . 
  it 's the best unless you actually earn money in poland , then it evens out or is even worse than elsewhere . 
  there 's a huge economic gap between us and for example germany ( even eastern ) . 
  and so have poland , the keyword being ` some ' . 
  you ca n't trace every single small project . 
  i guess that just as much as there would go if they funded it from their own budget . 
  i have to say that you constantly see this big boards with amount of money from the eu that was used to complete given investment . 
  they are all over the schools , most recently build roads , some museums . 
  it 's usually up to half of the full investment . 
  does n't norway only have like 5 million inhabitants ? 
  we could move enough emigrants to take over ... we already have strategic emigration forces located in iceland and uk . 
  we can always pull some reinforcements from the us and germany . 
  the vanguard of 80 000 is already in norway . 
  112 is the universal emergency number in the eu and some countries outside of eu . 
  110 wo n't work for example in poland . 
  why is poland holding to an anchor ? 
  yeah , the only difference being that most posters are from the us ... 
  that was version 0.1 a of the procedure above . 
  in poland we had `` lay on the floor , wrap yourself in clean bedsheets and very slowly crawl towards the nearest cemetery '', 
  / r/propagandaposters is worth visiting for more, 
  calling a cab driver `` z\u0142ot\u00f3wa '' is quite popular in krak\u00f3w , and i guess it 's also used in the upper silesia . 
  the area of the us is 9 373 967 km \u00b2 , while the area of the eu is 4 324 782 km \u00b2 . 
  you might have mistook europe for the eu - the area of europe is roughly 10,5 mln km \u00b2 . 
  i think that 's the very best comparison on that matter i 've ever heard . 
  it hits right into the heart of the idea . 
  maybe not but they would have beaten you to death over protesting some of their changes or they would put a bullet into back of your head for fighting in wwii . 
  in poland you can get fined ( or even get some jail time ? ), 
  for insulting the authority of the president - so for example if you say that `` president xyz it a twat '' you are breaking the law , but if you say `` xyz is a twat '' other laws apply ( the president , as a person , has to sue you ) . 
  it 's a stupid law imho and should be removed . 
  it 's leftover from mid-war and communist period of polish history . 
  poland is safe then , because our trains never arrive on time :d, 
  i think that the english prefer germans using trains to germans using planes . 
  how german of you :d, 
  do n't forget about the jewish scums !, 
  shit , if i had to make a choice between reading / r/spacedicks or something about smole\u0144sk every single day for the rest of my life , i would pick spacedicks . 
  i actually started using reddit because it was the only smole\u0144sk-free place i could quickly find .

  where the hell do you think we can fit all of them ? 
  yup , i have to admit that i have n't even checked the english spelling - it sounds foreign enough in polish that i though it was the original spelling . 
  edited . 
  it could be defended more easily this way . 
  you could n't land an army in the middle of any peninsula before wwii . 
  it provided you with more time to prepare for fighting . 
  similar thing happened in poland - former capital , krak\u00f3w , was too far away from many parts of the commonwealth , especially lithuania . 
  in case of an enemy attack , the city might have not held long enough for reinforcement to arrive . 
  more than that , krak\u00f3w was a polish city , and it was more politically correct to establish a new capital , so that the lithuanians would be more content with that . 
  the chose warsaw because it was roughly in the centre of the country and it was the place where the parliament was holding its meetings . 
  the difference is that warsaw was n't exactly a shit hole . 
  i meant today 's ukraine , but still a good point . 
  edited . 
  i think they would be these people if there were any muslim immigrants in poland . 
  they pick on polish tatars , who have been living here for hundreds of years , some of them are probably more native than these pricks , and their only misfortune is that they are muslim ... 
  that 's due to population density . 
  after the war we chucked out germans to the eastern germany , took some refugees from ~ ~ ukraine ~ ~ kresy and placed them there , to live in abandoned german buildings . 
  actually i think that one the most widely known comedies - `` sami swoi '' is about a family which had to move to the terrains of former prussia . 
  it feels like the society was a drunk driver , swerving from one side of the road to the other , sometimes hitting trees and then starting it all again . 
  what i 'm worried about is that the most young people i meet are very right-wing . 
  every muslim , jew , centre-to-left-wing person , black person , politician , civil servant , gypsy ( not even that , they rarely differentiate romanians and gypsies ) , policeman , gay person or anybody from africa is spawn of satan . 
  it might be just some bias due to me using the internet as the main source of news , but something like this gay-bashing in russia you can see in this subreddit is not something that ca n't happen here .
