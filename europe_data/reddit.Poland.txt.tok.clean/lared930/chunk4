  it led to some interesting situations , like them asking me to `` nala\u0107 me some socko '' or `` ich brauche \u0142y\u017cka '' . 
  none of the parents are willing to come back , so i 'd expect that with time they will blend with the locals , as you said . 
   what about infrastructure they have so many motorways , airports and flats that they do n't even use them all !, 
  about 21 000 children of polish parents were born in england and wales in 2013 . 
  i 'd be very surprised if 10 % of them ever returned to poland . 
  vehicle inspections on commercial vehicles are more frequent and a bit more thorough ( as you can expect them to be drived daily for many hours , more often than a regular car ) . 
  the commercial driver 's licence also expires a lot sooner , so that you make sure the drivers have more frequent health checkups . 
  more than that the commercial drivers are treated more harshly when they break rules , as doing so puts more than just them into danger . 
  you also have to show that you are more proficient driver than a guy who just got his driver 's licence and that you know the rules regarding moving people around commercially . 
  what is unreasonable in forcing people who drive other people for money ( and make profit off it ) to have proper commercial insurance and drivers ' licence and having their cars checked more frequently than private cars ? 
  in my city there are taxi services , which are fairly strictly regulated and there are `` przewozy os\u00f3b '' including pseudo-taxis ( they do n't have to adhere to any pricing schemes but other requirements do n't change ) . 
  uber fits perfectly well into the second category . 
  over here , there are many incidents involving private buses when they are overloaded or in poor condition - imagine how many more incidents there would be if the profession did n't require proper licence and vehicle check-ups . 
  add no insurance on top off that and you 'll end up paying incidents caused by these cretins off your own taxes . 
  [ actually there is a difference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xs1zztl.jpg ), 
  out of different events of the past decade i remember that , dubrovka theatre and 11th september attacks the most . 
  that and that siege near warsaw where some fuckwits used landmines to protect themselves against the police ( magdalenka shootout ) . 
  kursk sinking was also memorable . 
  i guess that i was more touched by these events when i was younger , i ca n't remember most of the massacres which happened recently . 
  the only choice of beer they have near me is some kind of shit sold in 1l plastic bottles . 
  any supermarket chain destroys them in that matter . 
  but i agree , they have an interesting selection of sweets . 
  english proficiency appropriate for using it as a politician is beyond what most language schools offer . 
  think of c2 level and some specialized vocabulary . 
  at least interpreters wo n't be hard to find . 
  with the current emission requirements their cars ca n't be reliably used to gas people , which is also an advantage . 
  el and ch have always confused the shit out of me . 
  i would like to remind that freedom of movement only applies to a citizen of a eea country who is : - residing for less than 3 months - working - studying or being self-sufficient ( including retired ) - in any case not being a burden on the social services of the host - a family member of a person who fits into one of the three points above [ [ source ] ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33152_en.htm ), 
  let 's do that with efta , eea , eu , schengen zone and eurozone . 
  i 'd imagine it would be a lot harder . 
  the statistics here only list regulated professions . 
  all these professionals have to obtain certificates which allow to track them around . 
  there are far more skilled professionals who move around but are not regulated , so very hard to track . 
  france has a shitty language to learn for slavic languages speakers and more poles know english than german . 
  more importantly the uk had no restriction on movement of labour since 2004 , unlike france which lifted them in 2008 and germany which lifted them in 2011 . 
  that 's an explanation for poland , at least . 
  just to give some idea szczecin is like 5km from the german border . 
  i remember him being moderator of 70 + subreddits , now he has 23 . 
  i would n't mind making 9k pln a month , as long as i get to keep living here . 
  wheels conservation principle ? 
   in balkan and slavic countries ca n't ride because wheels get stolen !, 
  ( had that happen once . ), 
  you should be happy that the wheel was n't the only thing that was left . 
  it 's much more tricky to ride on just a wheel than on a one-wheeled bicycle . 
  they have already opened warehouses in poland , which does n't have access to amazon . 
  they do n't pay workers half of that before taxes . 
  the last time i 've heard of them they offered 570-670 euro before taxes , on who knows what kind of contract ( most likely umowa-zlecenie , they said that 3.5 k of 5.5 k workers are temporary ), 
  yup . 
  unfortunately in time wojowie were replaced by vicious creatures called urz\u0119dnicy ... 
  what about the currywursttier ? 
  the choice of currency will greatly affect how their economy will work , should they vote yes . 
  i guess that people would n't care about independence if it would mean them being hurt economically . 
  and most recently road bicycle racing with rafa\u0142 majka i forgot about . 
  for several years there was also the strongmen competition with mariusz pudzianowski ( early 2000s ) , f1 racing with robert kubica ( 2006-2011 ) , then after that cross country skiing with justyna kowalczyk . 
  then from time to time some random sports like athletics ( mostly throwing things , pole jumping or swimming ) , handball , motorcycle speedway and other things like that . 
  i do n't think [ feliks dzier\u017cy\u0144ski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feliks_dzier%c5%bcy%c5%84ski ) has any fans over here . 
   ( who were balto-slavics , not germanic , btw ) . 
  they were also dicks who were n't easy to be killed . 
  they are the very reason why there was east prussia in the first place ( a dumbass polish prince sent some warmongering germans there to take care of the original prussians ), 
  that 's because we do n't sentence people without a fair trial any more . 
  it 's called basic human rights . 
  a guy from austria who wants a certain group of people to give up their culture . 
  something rings a bell ... 
   proving someone fought for isis is hard . 
  proving someone murdered another person can be hard , too , but we do n't sentence people to life in prison if we do n't have any proof . 
  echr prohibits stripping people of citizenship if it 's their only one . 
  on the other hand the cost of just two textbooks in english ( original ) from the uk would cost me about the same as a year of liability insurance for my car . 
  unaffordable for me . 
  working here for two months in the summer would get me about as much money as picking strawberries in germany for a month , including price of travel , accommodation and food . 
  it 's not true for everything . 
  electronics , cars , international travel and video games for example cost about the same when compared . 
  food , rent and clothes prices vary , but they are not everything . 
  i converted the lower part to euros , using the average yearly price in 2011 ( data from ecb ) unless specified otherwise .

  za\u017c\u00f3\u0142\u0107 g\u0119\u015bl\u0105 ja\u017a\u0144 !, 
  to be honest i did n't even know we had the ethiopian guy running for us . 
  his life story is interesting , too . 
  he was a sportsman in ethiopia , he stayed in europe in 1998 when he was attending some sort of competition ; in the meantime [ [ a war with eritrea ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eritrean%e2%80%93ethiopian_war ) started and he decided to stay . 
  apparently he mistook poland for holland . 
  in between 2008 and 2011 he stopped training due to financial situation and worked in the uk as a security guard and a forklift driver . 
  he came back when he was offered sponsorship . 
  king 's cross platform 8\u00a01/2 ? 
  goddamn it , i meant upper silesian . 
  i 'm always forgetting they are the other way around . 
  not a problem in poland , you ca n't use driver 's licence as a valid id in most cases . 
  it only works when buying booze or being stopped by the police . 
  it could double as one . 
  plus it would be nice to get in the vicinity of the sea in a civilized way . 
  ommiting lower silesian conurbation and gda\u0144sk is a mistake . 
  both are vital to the economy . 
  suck that , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a !, 
  you 'd have to stop at the border to switch the bogies .
