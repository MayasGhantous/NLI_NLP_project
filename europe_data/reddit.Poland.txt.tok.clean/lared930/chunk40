  i believe that our languages could be described as mutually silly . 
  i do n't know any slovak ( sorry ! ), 
  but in czech these are my favourite ones : odchod - in czech it means `` departure '' i think , in polish - `` excrements '' mam napad - '' i 've got an idea '' in czech , `` i 've got an attack '' in polish ( like heart attack ) vevere\u010dka - squirrel , but exactly as polish diminutive form moment\u00e1ln\u011b nep\u0159\u00edtomn\u00fd - in czech it means something along `` i 've gone and i 'll be back soon '' in polish it means `` immediately unconscious '' parek v rohliku - we 'll just laugh our asses off if we hear this . 
  n\u00e1rodn\u00ed divadlo - in polish : national eccentricity v\u00e1\u017een\u00ed divaci - in polish : important weirdos poruhany - in polish : recently fucked, 
  why is it funny ? 
  does it have some funny meaning in slovakian ? 
  something like `` szuka\u0107 '' ( to search in polish , to fuck in czech ) ? 
  it 's even more confusing because nadzwyczajny is higher up than the zwyczajny one . 
  you 'd think that extraordinary is better than the ordinary , but apparently it 's the other way around . 
  you must 've misunderstood me . 
  that 's what i meant to say - it 's the same here . 
  you forgot about poland . 
  in poland it is customary to address high school teachers per professor , but we also have two academia titles : profesor nadzwyczajny ( extraordinary professor - rough translation ) who is appointed by a specific university . 
  he has to be a habilitated or very successful phd . 
  profesor zwyczajny ( ordinary professor - rough translation ) is the highest rank possible , these people are awarded by the president himself . 
  is n't it a bit similar in czech republic ? 
  insuring that could be a bitch . 
  i would like to write more about the gun permit : - when dealing with any type of gun permits you have to prove that you need it - you have to pass psychological examination - you ca n't be an alcoholic , drunk addict - you have to have a permanent place of residence in poland - you ca n't have been sentenced ( unless it was an unintentional crime unrelated to killing except drunk driving , dui , hit and run ) - your local police station has to write a statement that they are fine with you having a gun ( this is one of the most problematic ones ) - if the gun is meant to be used for hunting , you have to be a member of some hunting club for at least a year , undergo a training and then pass an official exam - if the gun is meant to be used for self-defence you have to prove that you , your family or posessions are under some sort of a real , constant threat - if the gun is meant to be used for sport purposes , you have to be a member of a shooting club and attend a few competitions every year ; if you do n't , your license will be revoked . 
  one step at a time . 
  * cough * http://www.pw-sat.pl/ * cough *, 
  yes they do . 
  all the pairs of words sound exactly the same . 
  in writing , the spelling determines the meaning , while in speech the context does . 
  examples : rz = \u017c u = \u00f3 ch = h they are identical . 
  100-years-old grannies might spell these differently , but it has died out over time . 
  it is of course considered a major mistake to write the incorrect one . 
  sometimes one of them has no meaning , because it 's plainly incorrect , but sometimes there is a major difference in meaning : [ \u017c ] y\u0107 - to live [ rz ] y\u0107 - arse ------- mo [ \u017c ] e - might , may , maybe , can mo [ rz ] e - sea example : stary cz\u0142owiek i morze - the old man and the sea ( by ernest hemingway ) commonly used sentence to describe hugh hefner-like grandpas : stary cz\u0142owiek i mo\u017ce - he 's an old man but he can [ fuck ] ------- o bo [ \u017c ] e !, 
  - oh my god !, 
  ~ oh my forest !, 
  ------- l [ \u00f3 ] d - ice l [ u ] d - the people ------- m [ \u00f3 ] r - plague m [ u ] r - wall ------- [ h ] uj - dick ( incorrect ) [ ch ] uj - dick ( correct , because it 's longer ) as you might have guessed teaching children the rules of spelling these words takes about 6 years . 
  however weird it might sound , so would i. 
  i somehow like the idea but i do n't think 10 years is enough to reach that level of integration . 
  it would take about 50 years in my opinion . 
  united health care is very hard to implement , because it is now governed by individual countries . 
  the poorest countries wo n't catch up to the wealthiest in 10 years . 
  they are not likely to catch up in 50 , either . 
  the euro is another problem - it ties up independent economies - one of them plummets , the others are to follow . 
  euro is especially unsuitable for former warsaw pact countries - i think we should let them develop in peace using their own currency , and when they catch up with the rest of europe , introduce the euro . 
  i am somehow thankful to the news reporters for smole\u0144sk crash `` news '' . 
  i am paying 50z\u0142 a month less now because i cancelled the cable a week after the plane went down . 
  as only the non-polish news sources were bearable , i ended up brushing up my english as well . 
  well i 'd have to take a month off only to see these ;p, 
  the photos are not a replacement . 
  they are just previews , teasers . 
  you know what you can expect on arrival . 
  they are also quite handy when you are trying to find a very specific building you do n't know exact location of , but you 've seen it some time ago and know more or less where to look . 
  [ malbork castle ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/qht11 ) is quite impressive . 
  take a look around using satellite images , and then use street view like a zoom in . 
  it wo n't show you everything of course , but to see everything you would have to visit poland . 
  [ not a place i would call nice , ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/nefj9 ) but still worth seeing if you have n't seen it before . 
  look to the left , look to the right , look in the background . 
  can you see the ends ? 
  now imagine that only 70 years ago it was full of people . 
  look at the satellite images ; the white stripe behind the gate is the unloading platform . 
  each time a transport of people arrived , it was full of people . 
  [ this place is not auschwitz-birkenau camp !, 
  it 's auschwitz concentration camp . 
  ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/jfd5p ) note that these were separate . 
  again , take a look at the photos people made . 
  i 'll update this post as i get more images , i 'm using a shitty netbook now ... 
  has anyone recently done any studies about how many of these 6.2 million work illegally ( undeclared ) ? 
  it 's harder than just these 4 . 
  there are also southern slavic languages , like croatian or slovenian for example . 
  and do n't forget ukrainian - it 's a bit of a mess - mix of polish and russian and god-knows-what . 
  russian is a slavic language . 
  i am sure they had checked their firearms licences before leaving . 
  i am not sure about the whole fuss about the lease . 
  i hope the court will solve this problem in less than 50 years . 
  polish translation says that the armed men were hider by the owners of the station , and the workers were hired by the lease owner of the station . 
  the place was bought by someone else last year . 
  the previous owner , gmina chojna ( muncipality of chojna ) . 
  the new owners cancelled the lase multiple times , but there was something wrong with the lease conditions and the local court has been investigating it for the last few months . 
  in xivth century in the capital of poland , krak\u00f3w , some germans started a rebellion . 
  after the king returned to the city , he orderer to exile or slaughter everyone who could n't pronounce soczewica , miele , ko\u0142o i m\u0142yn , because it meant that these people probably were germans . 
  these are not requirements for being in central europe . 
  these are indicators that the country probably is n't in eastern europe . 
  i would n't call romania or hungary eastern european countries . 
  more than that , i think that hungary is perfectly fine central european country . 
  romania is in my opinion also more central than eastern . 
  the problem is that when people hear `` poland '' they immediately think about russia-like country . 
  it is not a compliment given rather shitty relations with russia for the last 500 years ( or even more ) . 
  some highlights why poland is more central than eastern : - latin alphabet - catholicism ( opposed to orthodox ) - influence of german culture ( in the language , for example ) - historically our cities developed faster than these in eastern europe - being a country between countries that are definitely western ( germany , france ) and countries that are definitely eastern ( like russia ), 
  \\* * cough * \\* ^ ^ ^ poland \\* * cough * \\*, 
  they have been like this for more than 500 years . 
  their politics have roots in tzars ' times . 
  was stalin really that different ? 
  or any of their leaders ? 
  they might have caused more deaths but they have never really cared much about their people and wanted as much influence as they could have . 
  just like tzars . 
  russia wants to regain the influence the ussr lost after its collapse . 
  quite simple , they have been trying really hard for the last 20 years . 
  look at georgia or belarus . 
  or the gas pipes . 
  in september russians are probably going to exercise pre-emptive nuclear strike on warsaw , look up zapad 2013 . 
  i did n't take nazis into account . 
  in poland we are indifferent to the military because during late communism they were neutral or pro-solidarity ( due to conscription ) . 
  but yeah , the image of dumb soldiers is still alive . 
  it makes a perfect sense now . 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  i know that military should n't be deployed by default in these situations , but when the scale of an event , let 's say flood , is massive , why did they `` get a lot of shit '' ?
