  in poland , for example , not so far away , one of the task s of army is to help during natural disasters when they are out of control . 
  they used their armoured transporters , boats and everything else capable of floating . 
  could you explain why did they get a lot of shit for that , please ? 
  in poland there is a law which states that the media ca n't explicitly state the name of the suspect unless the court states otherwise . 
  you ca n't see his face , you ca n't get his address unless the crime took place there , you do n't know his facebook address . 
  of course , as court trials are open to the public , you can show up and you will know everything . 
  but it takes some effort to get personal data , and most people are too lazy or too indifferent to do this . 
  but it is present on the international politics scene . 
  and the individual states are not . 
  but it has no direct representation in the international politics . 
  damn , my city has more people than south dakota and i do n't think that someone from other continent has a reason to know the address of the town hall . 
  nor should anyone outside essex know which city is its admin hq . 
  he had plans to reorganise his empire due to social unrest . 
  19th century was when the concept of nationality was formed for example in poland . 
  poles had little rights compared for example to native austrians . 
  and poland . 
  i think it depends on the mother tongue of the foreigner . 
  for example i can never put articles correctly in english , simply because we do n't have articles in polish . 
  we also tend to make very long , complicated sentences which are not very frequently used by the english . 
  i also have problems with perfect tenses . 
  they were used in polish hundreds of years ago , but they died out within the last 200 years . 
  you do n't memorize them . 
  you instinctively know which one to use . 
  it 's our mother tongue , so we learned it while we were still children . 
  the real problem comes when you have to describe these in grammar context . 
  it was my primary school nightmare . 
  the funny thing is that you can say what would mean `` two '' in english in 17 different ways in polish . 
  it 's not called `` the first '' and `` last '' name in hungarian simply because it 's the other way around there . 
  some commentary - this is a polish version of digg - a group of middle school students who believe that there should be a king in poland , there should be per head taxation , the gays , jews and muslims are pure evil , everything that polish government does is bound to be a failure . 
  or that people can drive just as well without bothering to get a driving licence . 
  funny to read . 
  until you realise these people will have right to vote in less than 10 years ... of course this is my opinion about the users of this site based off the comments they write and upvote/downvote pattern . 
  do n't forget czech republic . 
  i do n't know much about slovakia , but i guess it 's much more westernised than ukraine . 
  and by westernised i mean democratic and liberal , at least as liberal as one can be after decades of the shit that was going on . 
  germans used horses to haul artillery in 1939 , and so did poles . 
  english is the most commonly chosen second language spoken in poland by young people . 
  you can learn it without attending lessons at school , just by watching tv or using the internet . 
  i think enough of them to pass this act actually are . 
  unfortunately we have two-party politics at the moment and the difference in support is too small for them to risk passing that act and losing support . 
  ... which most of the people in poland ca n't tell apart , or believe that civil partnerships would lead to gay marriage . 
  they are voting against and they will keep voting against it until the society accepts it . 
  at the time there are too many older , conservative people to accept it . 
  young people usually do n't care about civil partnerships and would probably vote for the legalisation , yet it will take quite a few years for them to become the majority of voters . 
  accept it or not , you can not persuade the loudest close-minded group of catholic grannies to support this . 
  xenophobia in the purest form . 
  it will take another 20-40 years for it to die out . 
  i think it 's worth mentioning that you can drive a car which has learner signs and there is a person with at least 3 years experience inside . 
  which is not the case in poland for example , where only certified instructors can drive with you in a car which has brake and clutch pedals on the passenger 's side . 
  polish licenses obtained up to today do n't expire either . 
  in poland the categories am , a2 are being introduced tomorrow . 
  i can only guess that some other countries in eu have not introduced them as well . 
  edit : there is only a category now , which allows driving motorcycles with engines  50cm ^ 3 instead of a1 , a2 . 
  in order to drive vehicles which are included in am category you have to be 18 , you use any state-issued id as a driving license ( a bit dumb , it results in people participating in traffic without knowing driving rules ) . 
  as a pole i can say that whenever i hear anything in czech or slovakian i start laughing uncontrollably . 
  your accent is something like what characters in our cartoons sound like . 
  yes . 
  i hope that he will get caught eventually , then . 
  he could have just as well landed in prison for up to 10 years . 
  as i said there are still these policemen who served for communists or these who have wrong morality for such a job . 
  i hope that your friend have never driven under influence since then . 
  poland here . 
  some , usually older , people , who lived when poland was under communist rule , tend to give some gifts to doctors - keep in mind that most of the doctors in poland started their career before the zsrr fell - to get better services . 
  it is basically either a bribe or a reward for service . 
  of course nowadays it is usually not money - i believe that if you walked to a doctor 's office and offered him an envelope with a sum of money inside , and he has never treated you before , he would excuse himself for a moment and call the police . 
  during early 2000 's many doctors were caught on camera taking bribes , which costed them their job . 
  but a bottle of wine , or some other kind of alcohol is not considered a bribe , yet it works well . 
  it can get you ahead of other patients , might cause doctor to examine you more often . 
  of course if it is your family doctor , a bottle of something nice is some kind of investment for your future , as it makes the doctor remember you , and you can count on better treatment in the future . 
  me or my parents have never given a gift to a doctor , and i do n't support it . 
  it is just something that remained in the culture after these strange times before 1989 . 
  something related - in the 90 's you could easily bribe yourself off a ticket . 
  if you tried that nowadays , you would probably get arrested , because the policeman would have more to lose than to gain . 
  things change . 
  i 'm polish and yes , that 's just a bribe so they would be nicer to you . 
  you can possibly have your test results sooner or be dealt with faster than the others . 
  i believe that doctors are the most bribed profession in poland . 
  i would like to see statistics regarding computer usage divided by age . 
  in poland for example : | age | computer usage ( at least once a week ) | | : -- | : -- | | 16-24 | 95.2 % | 25-34 | 88.1 % | 35-44 | 76.0 % | 45-54 | 51.3 % | 55-64 | 31.5 % | 65-74 | 14.9 % and comparison between the countryside and cities : | location | computer usage ( at least once a week ) | | : -- | : -- | | big cities | 72.8 % | smaller cities | 60.1 % | countryside | 50.2 % gus says that 98.1 % of students use computers at least once a week . 
  edit : and some updated data about the internet access : | household type | internet access | | : -- | : -- | | * | 70.5 % | with at least one child | 91.5 % | without children | 60.0 % the people who do n't have access to the internet when asked about the reason for not having it responded ( approximated data - shitty bar graph only ) : | reason | % | trend | | : -- | : -- | : -- | | no need | ~ 57 % | increasing | lack of skills | ~ 38 % | increasing | computer is too expensive | ~ 26 % | steady | internet access too expensive | ~ 22 % | steady | other | ~ 18 % | lowering source : http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/nts_spolecz_inform_w_polsce_2008-2012.pdf, 
  but do n't tell that to the marshall of sejm , [ he would hit you with his stick . 
  that depends on how much of a creep you are . 
  it 's very similar in southern poland . 
  the whip is made out of willow branches . 
  we also pour water on them . 
  after reading some history - and geography-related ones i think that at least half of the poles would fail that test . 
  krakus also had a daughter , who killed herself instead of marrying a german . 
  there are tons of legends from krak\u00f3w , [ including amongst others one about a guy who likes to ride a chicken ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rsnbmkh.jpg ) . 
  economically it 's the worst choice you can make between these three countries . 
  art 135 ust 2 ] ( http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/detailsservlet?id=wdu19970880553 )  he who publicly insults the president of poland is a subject to up to 3 years of imprisonment . 
  it is an offence prosecuted ex officio , that is the president does n't have to ask the prosecution to start an investigation similar punishment is also technically available for publicly insulting poland , as in state or nation . 
  for personal insult ( but in public , i think ? ), 
  you have art 216 kk . 
  this kind of an offence is prosecuted at request of the insulted person, 
  where are yooou !, 
  aka dirty peasants . 
   ( aka second poland ) or even more conservative poland than poland itself . 
  that 's judging by the last elections ' results with breakdown by country . 
  we have something similar in some cities in poland . 
  in krak\u00f3w there are two lists of projects , one city-wide , and the other district-specific .
