  most of the projects were infrastructure-oriented , like repairing stuff in parks , creating new parks , redesigning pedestrian crossings , installing additional city bike stations , repairs of pavements , filling in gaps in bike path networks or planting trees . 
  the others were usually community or sports-related . 
  pretty similar to what can be seen in paris . 
  our budget was tiny compared to the one in paris , though , only about 10mln pln . 
  [ still , you ended up with that .

  we need nothing of that silliness .

  here , a post from today 's front page :  in order for europe to survive , jews and swedes must be destroyed . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3fg7n8/swedes_in_finland_want_to_make_finland_more/ctocbh5 ) what follows is praising the good effects of ethnic cleansing . 
  edit : np . 
  / u/scientiapotentia2 is a / r whiterights subscriber and capitalizes word white . 
  while maybe not a nazi , he 's clearly a white supremacist . 
  your own comment :  no castrate and kill them and then deport every one of their relatives , friends , acquaintances , etc. 
  repurpose the mosque they attended into a library or school dedicated to the destruction of savagery , barbarity and ignorance .

  he used household items as weapons . 
  he threw a mallet and some pipe first , he escaped with a knife iirc . 
  he was shot in the legs because the police deemed it too dangerous to let him leave . 
  the sound was added afterwards iirc . 
  it was video only . 
  the situation was very dynamic , there was no time for backup to arrive before he would have left the scene . 
  he had mental problems . 
  should we go on and kill everyone dangerous in psychiatric hospitals ? 
  he had other weapons on him . 
  they shot at him to stop him from escaping and endangering other people . 
  the court decided that the policemen have done the right thing . 
  he had mental problems . 
  he was placed in a psychiatric facility , possibly for the rest of his life . 
  he had a knife . 
  they shot at him since a guy mad enough to attack armed policemen would likely not think twice about attacking random people . 
  you must have some really bothersome drunk fishermen there .

  it 's unlikely he sees any prison due to health issues . 
  [ what about this ? 
  he managed to rack some large-ish negative karma , anyway :  romania : ( + ) 2143 ( - ) -1481, 
  poland too . 
  i agree . 
  poland volunteers to take care of it in place of greece . 
  you can run a city on that for half a decade . 
  and you 've murdered a bit of the north sea . 
  there are some leftover german traditions here and there . 
  maybe not the name , but the info page ( the red circle content ) is literally :  you fucked whore faggots , gays , cocksuckers . . let 's shoot them all hardly a friendly message . 
   but i do n't like their gay parades which are awful . 
  man in pink feathers with make up ... 
  if you actually looked for photos from the parades , they make up a small minority of all participants . 
  there are photos of them because that 's what makes more money to newspapers and online news portals . 
  you 're much safer with lgbt [ a-z ] *, 
  in poland banks can and do impose limits on daily cash machine withdrawals . 
  you can set is as you wish , i guess the banks can just set it for you . 
   decrease requirements , ~ ~ czech ~ ~ check . 
  30 % required to pass . 
   abolish entrance exams , check . 
  most unis do n't do them . 
   motivate teaching institutions to take everyone in and keep everyone in , no matter what . 
  check . 
  in schools you get paid for how many people you have in class , at uni you are paid for students which passed the previous year . 
   the results are great here : 70 % of age cohort gets matura , check . 
  71 % last year . 
   60 % ( or 67 % , depending how you count ) goes to the tertiary level . 
  we have come close to western europe , woo hoo . 
  sort of check . 
  where can we get the complimentary beer and atheism ? 
   only 1/4 of high schoolers and 1/5 of leaving class in primary schools managed to pass tests ( = answering at least 2/3 of questions ) . 
  this is worse result than what pessimists feared . 
  are the tests available online ? 
  and maybe the score distribution ? 
  edit : according to the official statistics , in poland only 23 % would pass maths with passing grade of 66 % , and somewhat less than that would pass polish . 
  given that you have to pass both , it would be a disaster . 
  no , i meant the place is irrelevant as long as you can find somebody who lets you have a wedding there and you pay the civil servant for trouble . 
  you can . 
  you can even have a civil marriage in a church ( as in without religious ceremony ) , as long as you can shell out 1k pln for the civil servant and probably double that to find a church which will agree on something like that . 
  that too . 
  most are bound by their vows of celibacy . 
  these are some conversations i 've read today on different polish forums and websites ( and i by no means support any of them ) : - marriage is defined as something between a man and a woman - gays can get married already ( to people of opposite sex ) - marriage is for procreation only - gayness is a disease and should be dealt with by any means necessary - most gays are paedophiles - in the us they let negroes marry and now they are burning their cities ( sic ) - they should be put in a camp for therapy ( no mention of pink triangles yet ) - now we should ship all faggots to the us - it 's a false flag for < insert any weird conspiracies you can think of  - now homofascism , maybe goatfuckers will want marriage , too ? 
  - faggotry is a mental disease and they should be isolated from the society and treated instead of letting faggots destroy civilization of white man ( this one had a jew in avatar ) - they will want to adopt babies next ( they already can , but not as a couple ) - gays throw their sexuality all over the place - three terrirost attacks , genocide in syria , poland is taking in refugees and now this ... - first gays , then they will legalize paedophilia - faggots ' propaganda campaign < some other gibberish  - it 's lefties way of taking over the country ( sic ) - it will force church to give gay weddings ( sic ) - it 's an effect of a long-term western propaganda actions ( no mention of the jews , this time ) - they will now walk down the streets with their penises exposed i think that the figure for poland is quite overstated . 
  pics or did n't happen . 
  it 's not related at all . 
   gay people choose to be gay . 
  that 's bollocks . 
  you ca n't change that . 
  numerous `` straight camps '' in the us have proven that . 
  it 's similar to the fact that you ca n't change whether you are left or right-handed at a whim . 
  neither can infertile couples , but you do allow them to marry . 
  in polish it 's dziewka vs dziwka , not that much of a difference . 
  polish law does n't do things like that . 
  or danuta ? 
  it 's up to x , it 's going to be lower . 
  they will likely get suspended prison sentence and a fine . 
  if i were to bet it 'd be like 1.5 years suspended for three years plus 4000pln each . 
  if they cooperate , that is . 
  they will be tried as adults . 
  the last guy who tried that got 1.5 year prison sentence suspended over a period of 3 years and a fine of 8k pln . 
  and he cooperated , unlike these two . 
  they 're great at ruining jokes about poland having hardly any muslims .
