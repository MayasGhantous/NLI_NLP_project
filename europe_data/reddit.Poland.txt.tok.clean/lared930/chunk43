  as to why we do n't like russians it basically boils down to pretty much the military conflicts and occupations - from xviith century , through partitions , then the conflicts after wwi , attack in 1939 and subsequent occupation by su after 1945 . 
  germans managed to somewhat fix the relationships before 1980s , last soviet units left poland in early 1990s . 
  the recent muscle flexing between nato and russia does n't help either , not to mention the war in ukraine . 
  the muslim community in poland did n't take that very well . 
  one of them refused to talk with the reporters , and the other one said he did n't want to speak with them on his own . 
  you linked to karmelicka , which iirc is a protected zone in krak\u00f3w ( as in there are some restrictions on how you can advertise ) . 
  you do n't have to go far from the centre to see [ shitty advertising ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bsplwzn.jpg ) . 
   even kazimierz has some shitty parts . 
  you only have to take a look at courtyards behind buildings . 
  blackened walls , chipping paint , the actual courtyard is likely for parking cars and has n't been taken care of for decades . 
  that 's like paid internship for the same thing * in poland * . 
  insanely low . 
  it is , indeed , grabarka . 
  you can tell by the number of crosses , or [ by reverse image search ] ( http://gosc.pl/doc/764417.rozmodlona-gora-krzyzy ) . 
  russians , for obvious reasons , and romanians , because people are uneducated and ca n't tell apart roma people from romanians ( and that 's not even a naming issue , as it 's cygan vs rumun ) . 
  some people near the ukrainian border also take issues with ukrainians due to [ the upa thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army#ethnic_cleansing_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_galicia ) . 
  i know , it 's still in poland , though , so i guess i get some partial credit here ( it was harder to find the catholic kneelers ) . 
  lots of people ca n't tell which silesia is which and just as many think opole is located somewhere near the sea . 
  i think the stereotype here is pretty safe . 
  people do n't care much about atheists , or catholics for that matter ( unless they are family members of the preachy kind of people , then they would be weirdos ) . 
  the more exotic religious views might angry an older lady , but apart from that people would at most see you as a weirdo . 
  again this might be different on the countryside ( and likely is - i 'd expect you to be the talking point of a village until people get bored ) . 
  in general i would say more of yes than no , but note that these are actually some hardcore orthodox guys ( the south-east where you can find them is the most religious region ) , you can find more hardcore catholic ones ( the ones i bumped into years ago wore knee pads , though - suckers ) . 
  people who like crawling on their knees are on the more extreme side of the spectrum , though . 
  it 's a bit more relaxed outside of the south or the south-east . 
  i ca n't say much more since i live in a large-ish city , but in general the more rural , the more religious . 
  he is not defending lgbt rights . 
  and [ he is a politically active right-wing nationalist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/387s7h/do_you_think_the_european_union_will_exist_20/crt5op3?context=3 ) . 
  i had him tagged so . 
   ramzez  redditor for 1 hour  only comments in this thread something is not right , is it ? 
  i have met people this stupid , and they are not that rare as you think in poland , as long as you know where to look . 
   but going from krakow to czestachova was one of a kind experience [ silly you , one should crawl on your knees there ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qiasjzz.jpg ) !, 
  that 's what the potholes are for ( according to the authorities ) . 
  it 's below average of the other eu countries because they did n't have to start over in 1989 . 
  all the roads other than green on this map are already being planned for construction ( as in there are allocated funds for them ) or are already under construction . 
  you ca n't build a road network overnight . 
  to be fair the stereotypical silesian is a guy who lives in a cave dug into a slag heap , [ and this is how he looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mgo61bl.jpg ), 
  [ that 's map of motorways and expressways ] ( http://ssc.siskom.waw.pl/nowa-mapa.png ) . 
  [ and here is how many roads were built over the last several years . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/pl-motorways-pl.svg/800px-pl-motorways-pl.svg.png ) the length of roads quintupled and you 're still bitching . 
  so now instead of hiding in denmark , we hide under the water . 
  not a bad idea . 
  that 's good , if you are going to sink a ship , which one would you hit first - the small one or the large one ? 
  by the way i do n't know what are the plans of polish navy in case of war except for running the fuck away to denmark . 
  sometimes the difference is surprisingly thin . 
  in poland you can pick the profile of your class , but ca n't change your courses ever after ( unless you change class ) . 
  [ this , i guess ?

  quite ... interesting ?

  the problem is that libya has no obligation of taking these people back , as they were likely illegals in libya too . 
  that 's like rounding a bunch of illegals in france and shipping them to italy . 
  these look like gminy , nobody does . 
  it 's two levels down from the biggest administrative divisions . 
  when exactly did the russians rule the south ? 
  what i meant is that he can send it * instead of * sending it back if he knows it 's going to fail . 
  sorry for causing confusion . 
  i guess that 's preferable to saying `` mam to w dupie '' - i 've got it up my arse . 
  admittedly that would have had worked , too . 
  plus even if they could get the 60 % majority he could slow the whole process down by sending things to the constitutional tribunal . 
  he might use these promises and his right to initiate a legislative process to undermine po ( as they would certainly block these ) just before elections . 
  it would have required an active effort of three fingers and eight keystrokes . 
  overturning presidential veto requires 3/5th of votes . 
  that 's a lot and unachievable for po . 
  he 's a catholic conservative . 
  the previous president did n't care about lgbt rights ( in a negative way ) , this one would actively oppose them . 
  there 's also a certain time limit for completing the projects , so if the project slows down too much it wo n't be refunded . 
  plus the infrastructural investments are going to dry up quite soon . 
  i believe they are going to be over by 2024 . 
  that will reduce the money flow towards us . 
   boli nas kurac i do n't know what the other part of the sentence means , but you should go and see a doctor . 
   ukraine and poland were in similar positions when the wall fell not really . 
  ukraine was part of the soviet union , poland was ` independent ' and neighbouring a country which would soon become much richer ( germany ) . 
  had we been incorporated into ussr in the 40s we would have likely ended up in a similar position . 
   maybe because it is the biggest and the most populous ? 
  just to give an idea - we have larger population than the other 6 countries which joined eu in 2004 combined . 
  38kk vs ~ 36kk . 
  unfortunately our military equipment has n't reached the level of the dangerous brooms of doom . 
  explosive diarrhoea .

  you can still invest in southern poland . 
  i 'll send you ~ ~ my ~ ~ the official bank account number if you want . 
  fixed-gear , motherfucker !, 
  what would you remove it for ? 
  in poland that 1.8 includes what we consider perfectly good czech/slovak/ukrainian / russian when we are drunk . 
  the region is religious as fuck and somewhat rural ( it could be easily renamed to catholland ) , pis is somewhat more attractive for religious people . 
  i am not at all surprised of the results . 
   korwin is n't half batshit crazy as braun or kowalski . 
  which does n't say much , as so are n't most people held against their will in mental health institutions . 
  likely some sort of artificial intelligence classification algorithm . 
  they can be very good with sufficient number of samples . 
   if i give you the car and then only get the money two days later you have enough time to be over all hills do n't you have some operators which do instant bank transfers ? 
  they have some agreements with the banks and send money on behalf of the bank ( sort of like credit card , but the customers being banks ) . 
  the transfer takes < 60 seconds ( i 've just checked it ) . 
  the downside is that sometimes they charge for frequent transactions , but for infrequent use they are just fine . 
  not really feasible , for example motorways with tolls in poland are operated by private companies who set their own prices - the only solution would be for them to be paid extra . 
  not to mention something affordable for germans likely wo n't be affordable for poles . 
  you can donate some to southern poland . 
  they were flying in one of three [ mi-17s ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/mil_mi-171sh_open_ramp.jpg ),
