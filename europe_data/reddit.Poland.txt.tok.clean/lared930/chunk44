  he really seems like he has a stale baguette up his arse . 
  you should capitalize white , as they do in a certain subreddit . 
  not that easy if they do n't have any papers on them , or if they are n't citizens of the country you want them to be dropped off .

  their statisticians were on a strike ? 
  it 's the only proper way of celebrating labour day , after all . 
  they could gain access from poland , but then again they can also do that somewhat easily now . 
  yeah , but over here hitting brakes with no reason at all ( or even worse - to endanger traffic ) is not permitted - hence both people being fined ( although it would be hard as hell to prove that you braked for no reason without a dashcam ), 
   because rear-ending someone on the road automatically puts you at fault for the accident not really . 
  if there are skid marks on the road you would both be fined , each for being an asshat . 
  it 's also dependant on the skills of a driver ( as well as their age and possible impairments like being tired ) , which vary regardless of what they drive . 
  it 's much simpler to have the safe common denominator for all drivers . 
  i believe in poland if you speed more than 50kmph over the limit in the cities the police * have to * take your licence away . 
  people were saying that `` they would have their licence taken away if there 's suddenly 30kmph limit out of nowhere '' . 
  yes , you idiot , if you drive 80kmph in 50kmph limit zone and are blind , you would . 
   information about the very first czech fighting on the side of isis turned out false . 
  someone mistook czech republic and chechen republic . 
  reminds me of the undereducated people sending threats to czech republic after some chechens have blown something up in the us . 
  also twoo weeks ago this was at ~ 70 points : http://np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/31kbvl/swedish_men_prior_to_cultural_marxism/ it was then removed because people from other subreddits linked it as example as to why you should n't visit / r/european, 
  you 're right , the last time i met a hitchhiker he had to repeat `` chy\u017cne '' three times , and i still needed to take a look at the map to see where he wants to get . 
  i was wrong then . 
  it 's still weird that he accommodated his surname to the ears of the english-speaking listeners . 
  there is a bit of difference between being rusty with polish and not knowing how to pronounce his own name . 
  \u017byli\u0144ski did n't pronounce the name of his family properly in the video , i wonder if he can speak polish at all . 
  that would be better , but / u/umagil 's point still stands - it depends on the quality of education , which can be unequal . 
  it would surely give a huge advantage to people who study law or something similar . 
  you 'd have to publish the list of all the possible questions along with answers beforehand . 
  i think in poland most people would fail miserably with the last of your questions . 
  even with all that it would n't be democratic , by definition . 
  in democracy everyone has right to cast an equal vote . 
  her being allowed to do so is the requirement for a proper democracy , no matter why she votes like that . 
  what you describe is not democracy . 
  then the government might construct the tests to favour their own voters . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  even with lifts it 's a pain in the ass for people on wheelchairs or with prams . 
   street was designed to host tram and 3 traffic lines i hate streets like these . 
  it 's like a small berlin wall for pedestrians . 
   very different from a russian or even eastern/central ukrainian city . 
  if the tracks were in a worse state most of these streets would pass for krak\u00f3w . 
  do n't touch my / r/badhistory entry :d . i never said warne\u0144czyk was crazy , i said that he got his head chopped off , which is quite unfortunate . 
  the brits claim that the left side of the road is the * right * side of the road . 
  well , when we got [ the frenchman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_iii_of_france#king_of_poland_.26_grand_duke_of_lithuania_.281573.e2.80.931575.29 ) he ran away , [ the german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustus_ii_the_strong ) was entertaining his friends by tossing foxes and bending horseshoes instead of actually ruling the country . 
  [ w\u0142adys\u0142aw iii warne\u0144czyk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_iii_of_poland ) started crusade against the ottoman empire and got his head chopped off in the very first battle . 
  [ zygmunt iii waza ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zygmunt_iii_waza ) , by the grace of god an absolute tool , started wars with everyone - including sweden , russia , ottoman empire and some germans . 
  [ zygmunt stary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_i_the_old ) had an opportunity in wiping out the future prussia , but nah , we 'll let them stay there , what can they do ? 
  and how exactly are cameras on high poles going to take care of it ? 
  it 's to discourage smugglers . 
  poland has the rank of [ marshall of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshal_of_poland ) , but it is only to be used in special circumstances during an active war . 
  it comes with [ a complementary bu\u0142awa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/bu%c5%82awa_rydza-%c5%9amig%c5%82ego.jpg ) . 
  to be fair they were trying to make a nation on their own after the wwii , but were defeated by our army . 
  while it 's not an excuse for ethnic cleansing of the area you can see why they were n't very fond of us . 
  in case of war they would be promptly cut off by belarus and surrounded . 
  that region would be a bitch and a half to defend , especially without sweden and finland to look after the baltic sea . 
  no investigation has been ( publicly ) started - the minister of defence would have to visit the prosecutors office since it 's not an offence prosecuted ex officio . 
  it 's not the first time something like that happened , a year or two ago several restaurants were tapped , some of the tapes featuring politicians and businessmen were released . 
  four people have been charged for that - three restaurant employees and one of the prominent businessmen , who is suspected of sponsoring this whole affair . 
  this time , since it 's the minister of defence , military counter-intelligence managed to detect it beforehand . 
  they will face up to 10 years in prison for insulting and attacking public officials , threats of violence and destruction of property . 
  - [ a restaurant where the polish and dutch ministers of defence were meant to meet was discovered to have been wiretaped . 
  ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-podsluchy-w-kolejnej-warszawskiej-restauracji-prokuratura-za,nid,1710444 ) - [ the pm along with ministers of interior and defence visited polish soldiers and policemen stationed in kosovo as part of the kfor ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/raport-swieta/najnowsze-fakty/news-wielkanoc-u-zolnierzy-i-policjantow-w-kosowie,nid,1710970 ) - [ 24 poles were evacuated from yemen with help of china and russia ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-24-polakow-ewakuowanych-z-jemenu-pomogli-rosjanie-i-chinczyc,nid,1710510 ) - [ 20 cannisters with battle gas dating from wwi were discovered near one of the warsaw 's forts . 
  at least one of them was full . 
  drunk drivers will have to pay a significant amount of money to a fund for the victims of drunk driving ; to get the right of driving a vehicle back they will additionally have to have alco-locks installed in all the vehicles they use . 
  recidivists will lose their licence for at least 3 years ( in special circumstances ) , and possibly for life ( the default ) . 
  all the posted pronunciations are ok , but the wikimedia lady had a shitty microphone . 
  we are only securing the interests of the horse minority . 
  ca n't you see how he hates the rider ? 
  how he 's trying to kick that warmongering tyrant off ? 
  how he is being exploited ? 
  you can laugh now , but our air force is already there . 
  obliczacz is good enough translation . 
  sort of funny ( if you 're desperate for fun ) , too . 
  [ coincidentally the petroleum industry was founded in poland . 
  [ this poem was seriously considered for polish anthemn in the mid-war period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rota_%28poem%29 ), 
  ironically enough people with polish passports in the us vote very conservatively compared to poland . 
  they would have to get 5 % of votes . 
  no chance for that , especially since i recall the guy 's name from some neo-nazi-esque publications . 
  it 's just a tram accident . 
  nothing interesting for people who do n't live in krak\u00f3w . 
  swastikas - not really . 
  crossed out david stars - yes , in most of the cases . 
   on the opposite side there was a lenin statue , which was demolished in 1989 ( earlier there were attempts to blow it up , in 1979 a group of people set explosives on the statue , but the explosion was too weak to do any serious harm to it ) . 
  actually the statue was sold to a swedish guy ( big bengt erlandsson ) and [ is still on display ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixbibovavo ) . 
  i believe the explosion only damaged the heel of the statue , but managed to shatter windows of the houses along aleja r\u00f3\u017c . 
  probably to avoid burns . 
  i thought you were meant to cover yourself with a clean , white sheet , and then slowly crawl towards the nearest cemetery ? 
  the friendly relationship turned out to be useful in 1939 when tens of thousand polish soldiers retreated through romania and hungary . 
  [ here 's a photo of some guys at czechoslovak-romanian-polish border ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ducadqe.jpg ) , [ polish-romanian border being marked ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qn8u5o5.jpg ) , [ checking papers near polish-czechoslovak border ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ivcv3ga.jpg ) , [ czechoslovakia again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6clpyxr.jpg ) . 
  there were also some photos of latvia , but blurry . 
  edit : [ poland-romania border at czeremosz ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xapcw4n.jpg ) ( cheremosh , now at ukraine ), 
  as mentioned somewhere else it 's not conscription like in switzerland , it 's a routine couple-weeks-long training which most people will likely never be called to do . 
  so it 's like comparing apples and pears - they sort of look the same , but are n't . 
  take them , a guy from there was really rude to me a few years ago . 
  admittedly what remains of the forts , the town centre and the hill hike was quite nice . 
  what about a split ? 
  we take chocim and kamieniec podolski , and you can take the rest ? 
  [ malbork was also pretty much fucked up during the war ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0wknlm7.jpg ), 
  are n't these mostly palaces ? 
  chenonceau is the closest to my idea of a castle , i would n't be willing to spend zombie apocalypse in any other of these . 
  not really , the high-speed part of the cmk has , as noted in the article , ects1 signalling , so it ca n't exactly go at full speed . 
  you can tell that this map is somewhat new just by looking at poland - the 200kmph part was opened only less than half a year ago .
