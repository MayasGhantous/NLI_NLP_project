  in poland it 's 76.6 % , not that good either ( although nowhere near as bad as in romania ) . 
  also we have worse sewage infrastructure ( available to 30.9 % of households , up from 21.3 in 2007 ) .

  left wing -  lewe skrzyd\u0142o -  lewy -  lewak ( `` someone who subscribes to left-wing ideology '' ) . 
  it has negative connotation due to it being a disparaging version of the word . 
  well , if you subscribe to neo-nazi ideology you clearly were n't the sharpest tool in the shed to start with . 
  it seems to be international , too . 
  for example a polish website wykop.pl currently has had a thread with like ~ 1750 upvotes about people talking shit about the polish pope ( the one who died like a decade ago , known for being passive towards paedophiles and whatnot ) and half of the posts were about `` why does n't youtube/twitter/whatever delete these videos ! '' . 
  of course at the same time they want to get rid of `` sandniggers '' and other `` filth '' and call people who disagree `` lewak '' , or `` leftie '' . 
  there 's also a bunch of libertarian shit . 
  the quality of that site was what made me ( eventually ) discover reddit a few years ago . 
  their content quality seems to have degraded even more since . 
  well , the romanian one is surely better suited for hiding in places to eavesdrop . 
  [ bogatynia mentioned in the article is an interesting place ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/bamaf ), 
  ehh , fuck it , i 'm going to translate it . 
  square brackets are my additions to mark the context of some of the expressions . 
  change of constitution is needed so that poland could become a country of safety , freedom , justice and equality - said on the flag day the leader of pis jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski . 
  he annoinced that pis will `` go their own way '' in regards to the constitutional tribunal . 
  kaczy\u0144ski emphasised that the state is not only an organization spanning over some territory , but that `` the state is and should be a moral quality '' . 
  `` the great achievement of patriotic circles , the great achievement of late president lech kaczy\u0144ski [ his brother ] is starting to bear fruits '' - he said during his speech in sejm [ the lower house of the parliament ] . 
  he emphasised that `` the offensive of the pedagogy of embarrasment , the offensive of all that which undermines national and community valuesis losing , and it 's losing in with all generations , in particular in the youngest one [ in regards to the previous government losing elections , apparently ] '' . 
  `` good is separate of evil . 
  everything which was done to mix the good and the bad , retreats '' - said kaczy\u0144ski . 
  `` we can talk about a sort of revival , we can talk about the creation of a huge white-red movement [ refers to the colors of the flags ] . 
  it 's needed by poland , because its existence is a requirement of regeneration of our country . '', 
  - he declared . 
  as he said , pis is standing in defence of abiding the constitution . 
  according to him the constitutional tribunal neglects , depite not having the right to do so , a bill which is referenced in the article 197 of constitution . 
  `` it 's essentially saying that not the nation is sovereign - the nation being represented by the parliament - but that the tribunal is sovereign . 
  we are not going to agree on that . '', 
  as he added , in other issues his party is ready for `` far-reaching compromises '' . 
  `` and we have agreed to compromises like that , because we had talks . 
  and it was not us who refused that compromise , it was refused by the president of the ct rzepli\u0144ski '' - he emphasised . 
  `` we will go our own way . 
  we will deal with that issue . 
  we will not agree on anarchy , even if that anarchy is guarded by courts . '', 
  - he declared . 
  according to kaczy\u0144ski change of the constitution is needed so that poland could become a country of safety , freedom , justice and equality . 
  the leader of pis reminded , that the third may constitution ( / / todo : add link ) assumed verification every 20 years . 
  `` the next year will mark the 20th anniversary of introduction of the constitution of the year 1997 . 
  is it not a good moment to start working on a new one ? 
  i think so . '', 
  - he emphasised . 
  `` i know that we are not likely going to get a constitutional majority in this sejm term , but there 's the next term . 
  we have many trumps [ not a great translation , but a funny one ] , we have much to offer to the society . 
  we can really achieve a grand success . 
  i think we will be able to find some allies , too . '', 
  he said . 
  according to kaczy\u0144ski the work on the new constitution should begin at the party level , then in sejm . 
  the leader of pis did n't dismiss the idea of a referendum , he noted though that it would not be binding [ no shit , they would lose ] . 
  as he emphasised pis will not try to impose extraconstitutional method of passing the new constitution . 
  `` we abide the law and constitution . 
  the new constitution should be designed according to the rules lined out in the current constitution '' he assured . 
  he also added that it could be beneficial to ask the society `` what it wants , what kind of poland - whether that which was , or that which is soon to be [ shitty translation ] - poland of safety , liberty , equality , justice and solidarity '' . 
  the leader of pis said that `` the real membership in europe means membership in the eu '' . 
  according to kaczy\u0144ski membership of poland in the eu is an `` element of safety '' . 
  `` we are treating it as something long-term . 
  for a simple reason - nowadays being in europe means membership in the eu . 
  there is no other way '' - he emphasised . 
  `` we want to be in the eu . 
  and that is the opinion of a huge majority of poles . 
  they who claim otherwise , talking even of eu exit referenda , are pests , political brawler . '', 
  kaczy\u0144ski emphasised that `` being in the eu does n't mean agreeing on everything '' . 
  `` it 's not agreeing on situation which would put our citizens in danger . 
  poles , specifically poles , which would violate law to w steady life , violate our moral order [ shitty translation ] '' `` these who want to be in poland , have to treat out law and morality as their own . 
  there is no other way , we will agree on nothing less '' according to the leader of pis poland has to exit the trap of moderate development and develop fast . 
  as he emphasised it requires help of the state . 
  `` and we hae such a plan . 
  it 's morawiecki 's plan . 
  a grand plan , the biggest plan conceived ( ... ) in the last 27 years . 
  this plan required certain instrumentarium '' . 
  he evaluated that the entire government should work to make that plan succeed , not only the ministry of economy . 
  given that the pap article which was source for my previous post has n't been translated into english to this very day , i am going to assume that this one is not going to get translated either . 
  i 'm afraid you are going to have to rely on google translate or similar services . 
  keep in mind that the entire city is going to be literally besieged , since it 's expected that on some days the population is going to triple . 
  most locals are planning vacations on that week since the city is guaranteed to be gridlocked . 
  also , bring good shoes , since you 're going to walk like 10-15km to one of the events . 
  their surge pricing is likely against krak\u00f3w 's max price laws ( which were introduced after people were scammed for 300z\u0142 for a taxi ride from the airport to the city centre ) , plus the drivers might not have necessary licences ( some safety training thing + knowledge of the city ) or commercial insurance . 
  afaik now uber requires having a registered company . 
  you have to take into account that this subreddit has a right-wing bias , so naturally you would get a bit more exposed to the more nationalist side of the news , especially in regards to immigration and such . 
  the current polish government being , apart from being a bunch of cunts , conservative , does n't help that image either . 
  the reason pis is able to do the shit they do in poland is because of parliament entry thresholds . 
  about 16.5 % of votes were discarded due to them , bumping pis from 37.58 % of seats to 51.09 % . 
  i must have missed the order thing while reviewing the changes in the bill . 
  they are a pain in the ass to work with , i 'd rather see highlighted changes in the unified bill . 
  they fucked around with picking the ct judges . 
  by law the nominations of a new judge can only happen after the previous judge steps down after 9 years . 
  during previous government 's rule , three of the judges were picked according to the rule i mentioned above , but the terms of two additional judges were to expire just after the change of governments . 
  citing `` the need to have continuity and possible mess after the elections , but before forming the government '' , the previous government also picked these two replacement judges ilegally ( before the term of the previous judges was up ) . 
  mind you that was in one sitting . 
  before the elections pis ( the current ruling party ) asked the constitutional tribunal itself to investigate that , but later on cancelled that request . 
  fast forward to after the elections , they ask the ct to investigate again . 
  the ct , without the new two judges ( they ca n't rule about themselves ) , ruled that the choice of the two extra judges was illegal , but the choice of the three judges whose terms were up was legal . 
  the two illegally picked judges stepped down almost immediately . 
  now the law is pretty vague here . 
  it requires the president to publish the ruling , but does n't put a definite time limit for the publication . 
  it 's also unclear whether the ruling is valid without publishing by the president . 
  the general consensus of lawyers is that if there is no time limit , it should be published immediately . 
  since it would be very inconvenient for pis to have more judges picked by po in the ct , the president refuses to publish the ruling of the ct about the illegal picking of two po judges , and the parliament passes new nominations for five judges - the two whose terms was up , and three new ones to replace the ones legally picked by po . 
  the president refuses to swear in the three po judges .
