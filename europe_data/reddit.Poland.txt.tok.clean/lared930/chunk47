  the area is quite marshy , so the water can move things around , especially after significant rainfall . 
  these pop up from the ground every now and then . 
  not every piece is noticed right away . 
  they do n't qualify as `` nieletni '' ( they 'd have to be below 17 when they committed the crime ) . 
  they will likely be tried as `` m\u0142odociani '' , which can reduce the punishment ( `` nadzwyczajne z\u0142agodzenie kary '' ) or in special circumstances be substituted ( `` odst\u0105pienie od wykonania kary '' ) - in this case likely something like fine or publication of the verdict in mass media . 
  also they wo n't go to prison anyway , if they get prison sentence it 's going to be suspended . 
  and if they do break the conditions of suspension they 'll send them to a prison with people below 21 ( `` m\u0142odociani '' ) . 
  because the whole site is treated as a cemetery and no ground works are allowed there . 
  we do n't have the class divisions as visible as the uk does . 
  i 'd expect 17 years-olds who are on a trip to a concentration camp to connect the ~ ~ lines ~ ~ dots and realise that whatever old items they are picking up from the ground come from when the camp was operational . 
  if previous sentences are any indicators , they 're going to get 1.5 year in prison suspended for 3 years and a fine between 2k and 10k pln . 
  however they refused to plead guilty , so they might get harsher sentences . 
  samsung has no monopoly on the market . 
  of course there are other laws like these prohibiting collusion which apply to everyone , but product bundling is not one of them . 
  still , play store has a huge market share amongst app stores for android . 
  it 's effectively another market where google ( or whatever the android company is called now ) has monopoly . 
  the thing is that the eu does n't want google to not install anything , it wants to give users a choice . 
  that means that while there are probably no restrictions on play market itself , installation of google services would have to become voluntary , not pre-decided . 
  or maybe the user should be given a choice of apps to install ( like top 10 installed map apps from play store instead of just default google maps ? ) . 
  finally they should be able to uninstall things like google play games without resorting to rooting their phone . 
  it 's not punished for sharing , it 's punished for requiring to install google apps along with each installation of play market , even though these products are unrelated except for the company who makes money out of them . 
  they basically use their position of monopoly on app stores market to to get ahead in other markets . 
  that is not allowed when you are company that big , because it causes snowball effect , which in turns makes you a total monopoly in multiple markets , which is going to hurt the customers ( since they have no choice , and choice is generally considered beneficial to the customers ) . 
  they get in trouble because they are monopolists . 
  lack of competition is bad , i do n't think i have to explain you why , so companies which dominate the market have additional laws they have to adhere to - that includes not bundling their products ( google apps have to be installed and default when installing play store ) . 
  it 's not wild west , compared with the us the eu has pretty extensive customer protection laws . 
  apple is nowhere near the position of monopoly . 
  android has 75 % + market share . 
  the laws were designed to hurt monopolies , since when they reach that high of market share they can effectively grab the rest without even breaking a sweat . 
  apple is not capable of doing that . 
  the os itself is not the problem , it 's play store . 
  if you want to install it , you have to install a bunch of unrelated apps like maps or whatever . 
  they besically use one of their product to gain market share of other products , which is not allowed when you are a monopoly . 
  they require google apps like chrome and maps to be installed along with play market . 
  there is no reason for that , and as they hold 75 % + of the market they are subject of laws which prohibit them to bundle their products . 
  on an unrelated note [ round tables are pretty popular in poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_round_table_agreement ), 
  i believe that some republican states refused funding for obamacare ( it would be covered 100 % from federal funds for start , with the states having to pick up 10 % after a few years ) . 
  the previous cheaper plans while they had lower deductibles and monthly payments also had coverage ceilings and did n't cover people with chronic diseases . 
  multiple flags can look pretty nice : http://www.auschwitz.org/gfx/auschwitz/_thumbs/pl/defaultaktualnosci/414/1853/1/20161028_kom_miedz,ohucn6imphcvqckhzpy.jpg, 
  why would someone leaving poland write there ? 
  a good chunk of younger people in my family have already started families abroad . 
  they do n't have competitive prices compared to , for example , icar . 
  they charge roughly the same but there 's more icar drivers around . 
   let . 
  customers . 
  choose . 
  that 's how you get industries with no safety of health regulations . 
  like a shitty chippy who has fried his cat by mistake when he was drunk . 
  or drivers who have to rely on other people 's money when they get into accident ( i am talking about lack of commercial insurance for uber drivers ) . 
  the receipt thing is an interesting thing in poland , because by law the drivers , so the company which provided the service , has to issue the receipt . 
  but what you get is a pdf from uber . 
  some drivers do n't even have cash register in the car ( i believe the fine for that is 10k pln ), 
  yeah , your idea of invading an african country is much better : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59xzj2/rome_gives_visegrad_4_a_no_refugees_no_money/d9cn11i/, 
  there are occasional people walking by offering different services like internet or whatnot - but sometimes they just want to enter your flat to see how easy it is to break in and how many valuables they can spot . 
  for the last 26 years poland has been in agreement with canada which already includes arbitrage . 
  see article 9 : http://www.sice.oas.org/investment/bitsbycountry/bits/can_poland_e.asp, 
  unless you had some sort of package or something - yeah , i would likely not open the door . 
  take a look here : http://udsc.gov.pl/statystyki/raporty-okresowe/zestawienia-roczne/ the number is closer to 100 000 , and almost all of them are on some sort of work visa ( most temporary ) . 
  only a couple dozens of people are refugees . 
  they might not care about rt but they spew almost the same shit anyways . 
  let me cite another guy 's post : https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/59ucyb/uber_drivers_in_the_uk_have_won_an_employment/d9bhgbn/  the full judgment is here : https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aslam-and-farrar-v-uber-reasons-20161028.pdf  the key reasons why the tribunal considered uber drivers as employees are here : https://imgur.com/a/q7ipo  edit - summary of the key reasons :  1 . 
  uber has sole and absolute discretion to accept or decline bookings  2 . 
  uber interviews and recruits drivers  3 . 
  uber controls key information -- passenger contact details and destination in particular . 
  drivers ca n't access such information and do n't even know where they are going until the trip starts . 
  uber requires drivers to accept trips assigned to them  5 . 
  uber sets the default route  6 . 
  uber fixes the fare and drivers ca n't negotiate a higher fare or other terms with passengers ( as an independent contractor would be able to )  7 . 
  uber imposes fixed conditions such as the type of vehicle that drivers must use and how drivers do their work  8 . 
  uber subjects drivers to performance management and disciplinary procedures  9 . 
  uber determines issues such as rebates without involving the driver  10 . 
  the discontinued guaranteed earnings scheme ( fixed pay being a characteristic of employees )  11 . 
  uber takes on risk of loss such as in the case of fraudulent passengers  12 . 
  uber ( not the drivers ) handles complaints by passengers , including complaints about drivers  13 . 
  uber can amend the drivers ' terms unilaterally  14 . 
  forbidding drivers from contacting passengers after rides ( someone running a business would normally be able to contact his clients )  15 using terms like `` on-duty '' and `` off-duty '' and referring to `` our drivers '' and `` our vehicles '', 
  poland is not really socially liberal in any sense of the word when compared to other european countries . 
  it is pretty much the definition of unemployment everywhere . 
  percentage of people actively looking for a job . 
  most of microsoft 's kernel contributions were to support their own hypervisor , so that you could run virtualized linux on windows machines . 
   probably a couple years of use of git . 
  now that 's an overstatement unless you just used guis all the time . 
   broadly speaking , the left are those who oppose traditional thinking . 
  but ideas become traditional because they 're successful . 
  was slavery successful ? 
  because it certainly was traditional thinking . 
  it is not that they are allowed to do what they want , but the sentencing could be different based on that , and the lower court half-assed their procedures . 
  similar ancient system is used in poland . 
  there are 3 or 4 incoming and outgoing sessions on work days , none on the weekends . 
  if you do n't make it before , say , 16 on friday - you have to wait until monday . 
  only transfers within the bank are instant . 
  of course there are companies which work around that - they create accounts in all the banks they can , build a synchronization mechanism on top of that and allow you transferring money to these accounts , with destination account stored in metadata . 
  when they detect a transfer in your bank , they transfer money to the destination account in the destination bank . 
  all within a few minutes . 
  the downside is of course that they take fees for that service . 
  in poland there 's biuro informacji kredytowej , if you take out a loan you agree to have that information persisted there . 
  banks are unwilling to give you a mortgage on good terms without any kind of credit history , especially if the rest of your application is n't particularly good ( for example the instalments being a larger than usual part of your combined household income ) . 
  i 'm kind of surprised that the process is not automated more . 
  for example putting up these cardboard boxes . 
  i would n't have thought the amortized cost of the machines to perform this task would exceed the cost of labour , but apparently it might .
