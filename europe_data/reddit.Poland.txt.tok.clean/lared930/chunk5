  they have different distance between rails than most of europe . 
  edit : it goes only for kaliningrad , otherwise you 'd a have already switched bogies in the baltics/belarus/ukraine, 
  and you do n't have to spend hours at the airport . 
  and you do n't really need a passport , id is sufficient . 
  fits better in the wallet . 
  i do n't know about the baltics , but in poland e-75 , the part between lithuania and warsaw , is being modernized to accommodate trains with speeds not exceeding 160km/h ( shame it 's not 250 ) . 
  connecting warsaw with gda\u0144sk would be nice . 
  kalisz was unfortunate enough to be destroyed by germans during the first world war . 
  my local lidl 's beer selection is ... disappointing . 
  you 'd expect more from a german supermarket network . 
  tesco ( the big ones , at least ) are much , much better in this regard . 
  biedronka is better , too , plus it has these nice , big and cheap packs of crisps . 
  over here i can choose between tesco , carrefour , lidl , real and biedronka . 
  lidl is rather the shittier one . 
  just by looking at it i am going to guess that kolache are an easier to pronounce equivalent to what 's called okr\u0105g\u0142a dro\u017cd\u017c\u00f3wka z [ czym\u015b ] ( round yeast-dough thingy with [ whatever the filling is ] ) . 
  readily available at any civilized bakery over here . 
  in poland it 's even worse with these [ bloody sound barriers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p9v3e80.jpg ) . 
  they are everywhere :(, 
  there is no permanent lenin statue in krak\u00f3w ( nowa huta is a district of krak\u00f3w ) . 
  the current lenin is small and part of artboom festival . 
  the original lenin was sold to some swede whom i 've identified in the past but reddit does n't permit searching your own posts :( edit : [ [ size comparison of the pissing lenin ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dspip26.jpg ) [ [ size comparison of the old lenin at aleja r\u00f3\u017c . 
  ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/55mapqm.jpg ) people tried to blow him up a couple of times but to no avail . 
  edit2 : the swede was called bendt erlandsson , the purchase took place in 1992 , the scrap cost 100 000 sek and is likely on display somewhere near stockholm . 
  yup . 
  it is , but it would fuck over the poor . 
  there 's a reason most income taxes are scaled depending on how much you make and vat has different rates depending on what you buy . 
  you forgot about the rector and pro rectors . 
  it 's understandable , though , as they do n't deal with the filth the students are . 
  in poland we got 0.41 for `` unreasonable delays '' . 
  seems about right . 
  `` earlier today german tanks rolled through warsaw , advancing in the eastern direction ; they met no resistance , they were even being cheered by the local people '', 
  a guy who got elected as an mp of the european parliament was , the last time i checked , supporter of ditching all taxes in favour of everyone paying a set amount of money each month . 
  what do they do with the removed bikes ? 
  are they taken apart and recycled/sold / ... ? 
  [ [ fields medal wiki ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fields_medal ), 
  not exactly for shits and giggles , but yes . 
  even if there are none it would be interesting to see a policeman on a bike hauling a huge cage , with bars , chains and stuff . 
  a skeleton would be a nice touch , too . 
  they should get some trailers to transport the arrestees . 
  on the other hand in the 50s we demolished various historical monuments in other devastated cities because bricks were needed for warsaw . 
  well , former tank crews then . 
  well , your tank crews do n't really have anything better to do now , do they ? 
  thanks !, 
  [ [ krak\u00f3w ] ] ( http://imgur.com/a/seuth ) as to why nobody likes the aquariums , that 's from the last week : [ [ a bit of derailment ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/picib44.jpg ) these rails are shit , but no train yet managed to derail this spectacularly . 
  edit : there 's also a museum line , it uses a seemingly random train from the local engineering museum . 
  the city also ordered 36 trains [ [ like this in the picture ] ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/krakow,50/beda-nowe-tramwaje-w-krakowie-miasto-kupi-krakowiaki-za-300-mln-zl,446028.html ) . 
  the polish parliament building 's resemblance to a circus tent is not coincidental . 
  wow . 
  i checked and yes , almost every catholic church in my city or its vicinity , just shy of 500 in total ( i might have missed some ) , has a website . 
  more than that the nearest church has a website which is responsive and well-designed overall . 
  the only bad thing i can say is that it does n't validate as valid html5 . 
  edit : it passes jslint . 
  holy fuck . 
  i wonder if you can see a small whirl in your gas tank when the engine 's on . 
  is the data self-reported or independently measured ? 
  or does it vary by country ? 
  they are probably the same kind of idiots who vandalised an old mosque in poland . 
  tatars living there moved there at least 300 years ago . 
  they might have been in poland longer than families of those who sprayed the walls of the mosque . 
  to be honest i would be surprised if tusk was recognized by anyone except polish tourists on vacations . 
  i have doubts about for example some presidents . 
  i know how the german one is called , but have no idea about how he looks like . 
  there is a lot of places in military women can be just as useful as men - logistics , communication , drivers to name a few . 
  we stole their job in less than two months !, 
  it 's maximum unless you are in hungary , they have 27 % vat . 
  unfortunately we only unlocked the pope in 1978 :(, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdkn57xveki ), 
  it 's usually fine , but if you run into gestapo-babcie it 's best just to move to the other side of the tram car ( if possible ) . 
  what one should not do is staying near the door unless you get off the tram at the next stop . 
  and even if you do have to stand there , get the fuck off the tram at the stop instead of standing at the very centre of the door . 
  if not you might end up * accidentally * pushed out regardless . 
  it took him only ~ 21 hours to swim across the english channel . 
  he is also apparently the first person in the world to both climb everest and swim across the channel . 
  admittedly though he swam to france and was assisted by his daughter on a boat . 
  one of your guys , apparently on binge drinking holiday , almost puked all over my shoes on the weekend ; it was a sufficient warning ... 
  it 's funny to hear it from a brit ;p, 
  it is n't hard to cross border to the uk . 
  the only different thing is that i need a passport ( or even just an id card ) . 
  schengen does n't matter , you 're thinking of eu or eea . 
  it 's [ tk-3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tks ) edit : or tks , but it 's nearly the same . 
  there was a photo of a girl sitting * inside * one of the crematoria furnaces at some concentration camps . 
  this sick fuck at the back is too close to the people on the right !, 
  we did ( fuck , maybe we still do ? ), 
  this in the mid-war period . 
  did n't really help , did it ? 
  - [ [ grenade launchers ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w4r7z6g.jpg ) - [ [ sad tankette ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sb2rewx.jpg ) edit : [ [ quite relevant comic - jesus : in the name of the gun . 
  it used to be fully free but now the author apparently charges for the second part of the first book ] ] ( http://jesuschriststory.com/ ), 
  do n't make any nazi signs at the concentration camps . 
  apparently every year some people get arrested for that thinking that police will take it as a joke . 
  the usual punishment is a suspended prison sentence and a fine . 
  the same goes for taking `` souvenirs '' from there . 
  if you wo n't get stopped at the camp itself , they 'll get you at the airport . 
  according to some article i found we export 60 % of 1.2 million tonnes of apples to russia annually , which amounts to roughly 19kg of apples a person , on top of the usual consumption . 
  in other words , what kind of booze can be made using apples ? 
  the list of names of all current foreign ministers : austria - kurz belguim - reynders bulgaria - vigenin croatia - pusi\u0107 cyprus - kasoulidis czech republic - zaoralek denmark - lidegaard estonia - paet finland - tuomioja france - fabius germany - steinmeier greece - venizelos hungary - navracsics ireland - flanagan italy - mogherini latvia - rinkevics lithuania - linkevicius luxembourg - asselborn malta - vella netherlands - timmermans poland - sikorski portugal - machete romania - corlatean slovakia - lajcak spain - marfil sweden - bildt uk - hammond my pick would be one of kurz-machete or asselborn-machete . 
  the second one only because there 's an ass hidden there . 
  i loved it , because it made a perfectly good sense with the two first submissions , but not so much with any of the following . 
  it took me a moment to figure it out . 
  oh , the memories ... or rather lack of thereof . 
   it is the product of ef education first , a global language training company , and draws its conclusions from data collected via english tests available for free over the internet .
