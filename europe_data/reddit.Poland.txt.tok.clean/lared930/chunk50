  electricity was expensive or not available , we never had much natural gas , the insulation in these buildings is shit , the furnaces have shitty efficiency and are often poorly maintained . 
  as of now i estimate that electrical heating would cost five times as much as coal , natural gas about three times as much . 
  as to municipal heating i have no idea , but you 'd have to make your neighbours switch , too, 
  sucha beskidzka , \u017bywiec and several other cities are located in valleys . 
  the movement of air is more or less restricted to couple directions . 
   that 's krak\u00f3w 's problem , scyscrapers are blocking air tunnels ) , krak\u00f3w has no skyscrapers . 
  the vast majority of buildings are at most 4 storey tall . 
  an odd b\u0142\u0119kitek or szkieletor have pretty much no effect on anything . 
  well , pompei was preserved very well under a thick layer of ash . 
  in comparison maybe , but jogging or riding a bike without a mask for a longer period of time will make you cough for the rest of the day . 
  and of course there were horribly idiotic ideas like nowa huta . 
  `` let 's make ironworks in area without coal or iron !, 
  overall yes , but it 's not the first time the magic copper dust appeared and nobody knows anything . 
  and even if you want to import yourself a perfectly good brit there 's always dozens of them at the language schools . 
  is n't the second one pretty much efta/eea ? 
  as for krak\u00f3w it 's mostly elektrownia skawina , nowa huta and coal fireplaces which contribute to that . 
  a few months ago someone in kombinat fucked up and we had a thin layer of what looked like oxidized copper covering everything . 
  of course there will be no investigation of any sort because people would lose jobs . 
  the ban was overturned by the court ( the city council wanted to allow wooden fireplaces , because half of them has them , which was deemed illegal ) . 
  the coal fireplaces are going to get banned starting at 2019 i think . 
  i guess it was a bit more of a derailment precaution . 
  they would get seriously fucked up if they flew across the train . 
  [ there 's a longer video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt3ro0uzftm ), 
  [ thet 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acls1pghp8o ) probably what it looks like there . 
  this pesa is a glorified tram which can go 140kmph , so it was most likely the speed lever . 
  the driver has to push down on it the entire time , the moment the pressure is lost ( for example he falls asleep ) the brakes engage . 
  edit : i 'm apparently wrong , a video from the cabin : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rsfpgfmjli, 
  the official statistics claim an order of magnitude less than that . 
  there are currently no more than 70 000 legal ukrainians in poland , and more than half of them has been here since before shit hit the fan . 
   but yeah , we do accept refugees that come from ukraine for example . 
  we only have three refugees from ukraine , less than 250 people due to humanitarian reasons in total . 
  the rest are economic migrants , usually on temporary visa , due to relaxation of the visa procedures . 
  if you look more closely on the regular reports ( the yearly ones are nice ) you 'll see that about 3000 refuge applications were refused . 
  / r/europe for the last year or two . 
  was n't jesus replaced with lech kaczy\u0144ski recently ? 
  jesus got into trouble for respecting people with different opinions too much or something like that . 
  it 's also called makro in some countries ( the metro group consumed the dutch chain , but the name remained ) . 
  it 's absolutely the biggest in my part of poland , with some competition from selgros ( which is a smaller chain , only in germany , poland and romania ) . 
   sweden , poland and co. ca n't put off joining the euro forever sure they can . 
  joining eurozone requires joining erm ii , which on the other hand is not something you have to do , so you can put that off indefinitely . 
  well then there is a strong correlation between number of your visit and decrease of the quality of london . 
  something to think about . 
  freedom of movement of capital , goods , workers and services ? 
   then why have immunity in the first place ? 
  to prevent the police and judicial branches of member states from interfering with how the ep works . 
  for example they could arrest all meps from the uk for the duration of a certain vote if the meps did n't have immunity . 
  that 's more than a month of average salary in some countries . 
  only if they target a specific company . 
  it 's the same thing as apple not paying taxes in ireland - as long as the laws passed apply to every company , there is no case to be made . 
  vowel deficiency can lead to serious cases of welshness . 
  if you sense a strong attraction to long names or sheep , contact a doctor . 
   krk here croatia , have some vowels : a \u0105 e \u0119 i o \u00f3 u y, 
  he was n't that good in other war contexts either , he was responsible for gallipoli . 
  more like having less power . 
  there is no single person in the eu which has as much power as a prime minster does in poland . 
  it 's https://en.wavelo.pl/, 
  not at all . 
  in krak\u00f3w : - you have to register online before renting ( which is ok , but i 'd rather be able to use a card if needed - i guess thieves could use some sort of pre-paid cards ) - you can only buy monthly plans ( 60 or 90 non-transferable minutes a day are covered by that , you pay a flat rate after that ) - you have to pay for the above with a debit or credit card ( which are popular but the most popular method of payments for services like that are bank transfers ) - there is no integration with my transport card ( which is also my student id ) - the area where you can leave your bike is fairly limited - you can leave the bike within the area above ( and not at the station ) but you have to pay extra ( ~ 1.5 h worth of riding ) - which can be a plus if you 're in a hurry - it is supposed to reach 150 stations and 1.5 k bikes , but what for if nobody is using it ? 
  ( most people used the previous editions specifically because they could top up their account and use the bikes when needed , not on a daily basis - you use your own bike for that , mostly ) in previous editions you got extra free time if you had a transport card ( it was subsidized by the city ) , but there were less stations , the system relied on your pre-paid account and the stations were closed for the winter ( the new system operates all year long ) . 
  and now i believe we are left with the shit described above for 8 years or so . 
  they even refuse to publish usage statistics . 
  banned . 
  it 's the very city centre . 
  in the context of the previous question i was talking about the buildings , not people . 
  it 's also the royal road , so the value of these properties is through the roof and all sorts of renovations are subsidized ( although also more expensive ) . 
  krak\u00f3w was not really affected by the war effort . 
  the city was never massively bombed . 
  sure there was some damage done during the war , but isolated ( mostly bridges , some industrial building , the soviets dropped a bomb on the castle for some reason , jewish cemeteries were destroyed ) . 
  as to the colour - to this day most people use coal-fired furnaces for heating , and on the eastern end of the city there 's a pretty large industrial estate ( steel foundries and other shit ) . 
  it 's possible that a different methodology was used . 
  otherwise the border of poland and germany would n't be that obvious . 
  the gif was probably posted due to people reading about the radiation levels over the molten core of fukushima from a few days ago . 
  but they offer different films . 
  it 's not refugees it 's economical migrants . 
  loads of them on temporary visas . 
  we only took 20 or so refugees fro there . 
  when you flush the toilet the stream of water pushes onto the air in the pipes , causing positive pressure which slows down the entire operation and promotes clogging . 
  the ventilation is used to prevent that by neutralizing the air pressure in the pipes . 
  also if you do n't do that and have a sink connected to the same drain pipe , the pressure build-up caused by using the sink will be relieved by pushing stinked up air through the water in the u-shaped thingie in your toilet , used precisely to prevent these smells from being emitted . 
  you still need some sort of ventilation for your plumbing to work correctly , i assume there 's just some sort of a small vent in the roof ? 
  how do the buildings without a chimney function ? 
  someone made [ this wikipedia-esque graphic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/relmfep.jpg ) ** battle of kebab ** - painting of unknown author showing a bold charge of count chav i on turkish camp date : 31 december 2016/1 january 2017 place : e\u0142k , armii krajowej result : turkish victory ** polish side ** participants : poland , facebook peasantry force : 25 infantarymen/dismounted hussars , 300-400 chavesses and camp followers , 50 000 facebook reservists losses : 1 killed , 15 taken prisoner ** turkish side ** participants : ottoman empire , the police forces : 4 janissaries , 150 policemen losses : 4 turks taken prisoners , policemen 's vacation, 
  that 's exactly the quote with chronology given by op, 
  also there is no mechanism for them to be forced to resign unless pis falls apart and no coalition would be possible . 
  not really , no . 
  especially since it was us who attacked ottoman empire during siege of vienna , it was not on our territory . 
  they were in financial trouble for a while now . 
  giving up museum reduced their expenses . 
  i do n't understand why goods sacked in 17th century have to be returned , especially since the first item on / u/culmensis list ... is a spoil of war against ottoman empire . 
   on the other hand - you should pay taxes from your 3.000.000,00 subsidy . 
  it 's a subsidy paid by the state to political parties with high enough support . 
  it does n't make sense to tax it , just as it does n't make sense to tax scholarships . 
  more sensible thing would be to charge for that education and forgive the debt if someone worked in bosnia for x years - but then again you are losing trained doctors , and with higher salaries they are able to pay the debt , so it only helps a bit . 
  the virtual land of bielefeld . 
  too late for that , you ca n't exactly force existing users to use end-to-end encryption .
