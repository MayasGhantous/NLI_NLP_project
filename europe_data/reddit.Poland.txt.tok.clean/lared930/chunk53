  other than occasional border controls you can travel wherever you want just with an id . 
  you ca n't be refused entry willy nilly and you do n't have to deal with visas . 
  i have n't seen them , but self-checkout in tesco 's is either totally empty or full of reportedly well-functioning adults who ca n't follow simple instructions . 
  i had to look her up , because in the context of what she was saying she was referred to as `` this whore '' rather than by her name . 
  yes , but less so than it used to be . 
  the reason is mostly money . 
  why work in poland if you can do the same thing in the uk/germany/ireland / whatever and make more , especially if you are young with no anchors here ( spouse , children , mortgage ) . 
  # income taxes : 0 . employer pays some of the social security , you never see that money 1 . take your gross salary , subtract your part of the social security 2 . subtract a fixed health insurance part from what 's left 3 . subtract deductions ( for instance there is a 50 % deduction up to ~ 43k pln annually for passing your copyrights on the employer , or a fixed deduction for commuting from another location ) 4 . assuming normal work contract you pay nothing for the first ~ 6k pln , 18 % for up to 85k pln , 32 % for anything above that so for instance : - the cost of employment of janek is 10k gross a month - his employer pays : - 810z\u0142 for retirement janek is never going to see - 540z\u0142 for disability fund - 204z\u0142 for unemployment fund - 8z\u0142 for unfair employers fund - janek pays ( out of 8 300zl he has on his job contract ) - 810z\u0142 for retirement he 's never going to see - 125z\u0142 for disability fund - 203z\u0142 for sickness fund - 645z\u0142 for health insurance - subtract deductions , janek works where he lives so that 's a measly 100z\u0142 or so - this all falls into the 18 % bracket , he pays 668z\u0142 income tax a month - janek takes home 5850z\u0142 a month so effective ( income tax + social security ) rate for janek is ~ 42 % . 
  if janek could get that creative work deduction it would be 37 % . 
  # consumption taxes : 23 % vat for most things , 8 % ( various agricultural goods which are not food , newspapers , pharmaceuticals , products of creators and artists , entertainment tickets , ho ( s ) tels etc ) 5 % ( basic foods , printed books ), 
  is this gross or net ? 
  if i were to run the city i would do the very opposite thing of what the current council and president think should be done . 
  even though it 's a bad heuristic you ca n't do worse than them . 
  krak\u00f3w used to be located on [ several islands on a large swamp ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ufjapp5g4oc/wmxxaufvkpi/aaaaaaaalde/f19rake57smxh3aqsd0rroiefcerejsuqclcb/s1600/01_osada.jpg ) ( the witcher - coincidence ? 
  i think not !, 
  ) , but most of these have been drained during medieval times . 
  nevertheless [ there were still numerous ponds back then ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cukvtzjwgfo/wrdcemljoqi/aaaaaaaalmc/yn6m5hgpdiktqdaeibfl3tasdvomxeqoaclcb/s1600/05_wawel.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mtdeokffqny/wmxxaffegoi/aaaaaaaalda/q2l3ssia_84jkbeuq41kk3tan_uwhj1zgclcb/s640/03_mlynowka.jpg ) , and the river [ was vital to the economy ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v3hyn5lidk4/wrdcgg8024i/aaaaaaaalm4/2owx2qg3f18qudi2mpvkmkeoyqtpxeloaclcb/s640/12_galary.jpg ) by the 19th century most of these were unfortunately drained , with [ a single fork of river ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rhbzcp4sfck/wokf6w-cjti/aaaaaaaaljg/3juhwkr8crejqczhiavo8mdcpcaaedd2aclcb/s640/03_mapa1813.jpg ) separating krak\u00f3w from the nearby town of kazimierz ( [ a slightly older depiction ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pdk32olfkuy/wiuotkfm4wi/aaaaaaaalqg/me8_ykccc4u5xywt0h1earia4s2cn9zwgclcb/s1600/01_fantastyczny.jpg ) ) . 
  a lot of smaller rivers were also victims of the xixth century , [ they are now flowing in canals below the city 's streets ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xl5dywdg8os/wmxxcpxkdsi/aaaaaaaaldo/hrnfpgrbrvueqrzjqjbvdpwuvsoc3jedgclcb/s640/11_sercanki.jpg ) or have been diverted into the main flow of wis\u0142a . 
  there were numerous plans of [ using the river for industrial purposes ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ewgeywiv7a/wokf8tnpqki/aaaaaaaalka/vr_pqsdtpwq4rxohqiq4vmvrmk9gmed_aclcb/s1600/10_bocznica.jpg ) , including building up the bank of the river to prevent floods and to be used for unloading of goods . 
  these also included [ building new canals ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ay2ngycbw6i/wokf93mosxi/aaaaaaaalky/gyoixkh6tb8pc_v0y8sebqva771hgdzjwclcb/s640/16_kanal_ulgi.jpg ) after the first and second world wars these plans were scratched , and you can only see remnants of the former rivers - [ near fortifications ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jwj9fno9srs/wmxxarfp4di/aaaaaaaaldi/c1fth3tbdzyv3p2zvkbfeoq-bzlofhaiwclcb/s1600/02_barbakan.jpg ) and when the canals join the river . 
  all that 's left now is unused unloading banks , with railways torn from them , some odd street names like `` upstream mills street '' , `` downstream mills street '' , `` venice '' , a few [ controlled dams ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oaps80crjqk/wkmgmvhskci/aaaaaaaaltc/zizxvhpb4hud4egqoxpxidnqgqnpe8dgaclcb/s1600/06_dabie.jpg ) which now prohibit any sort of freight or even other kind of river transport , and [ photos from when the river was not dirty as shit ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z85zyov-ki0/wkmgmgpixpi/aaaaaaaaltq/ukjpbtvff_mw7qjxixhsdlktxx3thot5aclcb/s1600/01_debnicki.jpg ) . 
  also [ old as shit photos of numerous bridges which do n't exist now ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sledcqiyf54/wiuotqzlvpi/aaaaaaaalqc/dmqawfiuvdgn8d0feqsqs3tk6u0a5exogclcb/s1600/02_pons_regalis.jpg ) ( this is the royal bridge ) . 
  even [ the nicer bridges ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b8jpxn2fvpg/wiuovcmbfji/aaaaaaaalri/_5miqf6eumyzknsnbg1fnwa74w175w_rqclcb/s640/13_krakus_korek.jpg ) were replaced by [ ugly pieces of shit ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/powstancow_slaskich_bridge%2ckrakow%2cpoland.jpg ) . 
  there is one [ former bridge ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ynco4cqgupm/wfmo1kanvyi/aaaaaaaakqw/zrly-qx8xaufm-4668re0njxszo3v-2hwclcb/s1600/01_stary_most.jpg ) which is now used as [ a viaduct ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ggl3kc1r_kw/wfmo1ei-nfi/aaaaaaaaksm/595hkefzb_speuryingcaa_iscmkvt-wqcew/s640/04_dietla.jpg ) so yeah , i would like more rivers please . 
  for the french the first world war and the first part of the inter-war period ( polish legions in france ) , for the brits the second world war ( memories of polish army in the west in particular ) . 
  the plans ( shitty quality ) can be seen here ( the pdf ) : http://pamiec.pl/pa/biblioteka-cyfrowa/dodatki-do-miesiecznika/13176,plan-operacji-zaczepnej-frontu-zachodniego-do-pobrania-w-formacie-pdf.html, 
  polish army was - weak - national so it got itself a support job in the war - it was to prevent naval landing of troops from the baltic and allow various soviet navy units to break into the north sea - so break through northern bundeswehr units , and then get to denmark and the netherlands . 
  keep in mind that by the time polish army arrived there , you would be a large smoking radioactive pit full of dead people . 
  there were additional motivations - it was determined that polish soldiers would not be willing to fight against french or british soldiers for historical reasons , but if you served them with germans , swamp germans and peninsula germans - they would be slightly more keen on killing them . 
  these were mostly not the same ones . 
  these who fought during market garden , as well as most of the polish forces in the west , were not exactly welcome back after the war , most of them lived the rest of their lives abroad . 
  especially officers who fought against the soviets during invasion of poland or earlier during the polish-bolshevik war . 
  polish army was supposed to occupy denmark and the netherlands , or whatever was left of them , in case of open war with nato . 
  apparently quite a lot of officers learned dutch and danish due to that . 
  we were meant to have on our disposal 177 tactical nuclear weapons , 17 nuclear bombs , 2 700 tanks , 2500 cannons , 400 air planes , 600 000 soldiers . 
  that was in the 70s but the idea was scratched only in late 80s . 
  i do n't really have high expectations when it comes to smaller crimes ( like theft ) . 
  they do make a lot of fuss about some traffic infractions ( like jaywalking across an empty street ) while ignoring some others ( parking violations of all kinds - i ca n't see shit when there 's a bus parked at an intersection , but they are only going to arrive hours later ) - so my opinion when it comes to traffic enforcement is quite negative . 
  my other encounters were either positive or neutral . 
  dublin\u00f3w is coming along nicely , though . 
  i have to take two weeks of paid vacation all at once , but i 'd rather split it into three parts , so that i can travel to three different foreign countries when the weather is nicer . 
  [ this particular scene ] ( https://youtu.be/mmqqpey96r4?t=4641 ) . 
  [ or the flag one ] ( https://youtu.be/mmqqpey96r4?t=572 ) . 
  there are english subtitles . 
  secret societies are banned by the constitution . 
  art 256 kk :  \u00a7 1 . 
  translated :  prohibited is existence of political parties and other organisations relating in their agenda to totalitarian methods and practices of nazism , fascism and communism , or others which agenda or activities include or allow for racial or nationality-based hate , use of force to gain power or influence the national policy , or which hide their structures and members . 
  lithuanian lorry drivers tend to be featured in the news quite often . 
  i highly doubt that it would even be legal in poland . 
  you can get a homeopathic number of extra enrollment points for high school if you volunteer ( somewhere in the vicinity of 1 % of total ) , but that 's it . 
  not the us or uk isps . 
  nice try , keep the politicians out of here . 
  they already buried a guy who achieved nothing beside kings here , we do n't need any more of that . 
   no person shall , in the course of a business , import into england , potatoes which he knows , or has reasonable cause to suspect , are from poland to be fair the glow helps you to peel them in rooms with insufficient illumination . 
  there 's not much apart from the city centre and maybe getting fucked up in kazimierz . 
  i think the most convenient ones are : - you do n't have to pay social security contributions as a personal contractor until you are 26 - public transportation ( and trains ) are roughly half off, 
  none , keep it simple . 
  i used to be taught by a professor who would only respond to emails which adress him by the correct title . 
  `` szanowny panie doktorze '' - nope , he was a professor , right into the spam folder . 
  the same would be done for emails starting with `` witam '' ( although that 's a bit understandable ) . 
  over here office hours are often the time you are the least likely to actually find the professor in his room . 
  since few people attend and everybody writes an email before they usually schedule it around lunch hours . 
  well , it was cheaper than flying to warsaw . 
  if i find a reason to go to milan between a tuesday evening and a friday morning then that 's also cheaper than going to warsaw atm . 
  depends . 
  i paid less for air tickets to edinburgh than for getting fucked up there . 
  well , sweden full of swedes , but the other places are fine . 
  limited as in you are able to make sense out of documentation , but you are unable to make a grammatically correct sentence . 
  some of them legitimately have problems with learning foreign languages , others just do n't care . 
  you can function as a programmer with limited english , but of course that 's going to be a deal breaker if you want to work for multinationals as a more senior developer or if you want to move to management or business analysis . 
  i 've worked with plenty of people with broken english , but not broken enough not to understand them . 
  they usually have lots of fun when doing l3 support ( unlike the customers ) . 
  it 's hard to compare laptop prices without having the exact model . 
  none of my schools had them either . 
   i see it as a substitute to welfare entirely . 
  instead of having 15 different welfare programs we simply have ubi to guarantee a minimum standard of living to all citizens . 
  i ca n't see it working . 
  people with medical conditions will need much more money to live than someone healthy , more than that they would not be able to get extra money because they are unable to work . 
  well , being more open-minded than an average person in poland is not exactly a high bar . 
  people here are also , in general , fluent english speakers , which basically excludes uneducated and old people . 
  here 's a scatterplot of average self-reported monthly gross earnings a year after graduation ( master 's ) for 2014 - these are figures reported by the universities : http://bigpicture.pl/doc/absolwenci/ ` niestacjonarne ` are weekend studies ( so the alumni have more experience since they have been working longer ) , ` stacjonarne ` are the usual weekday studies . 
  note that from what i know these numbers are probably lower than the actual earning figures ( i do n't know why , though - i might have a skewed view , though ) the horizontal axis is the time of search for work in months , the vertical one is gross earnings . 
  there is no europe-centric service like this because people use different languages .

  not exactly germany and not exactly stasi , but my grandfather ( and most of the village he lived in ) apparently was spied on for [ sb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c5%82u%c5%bcba_bezpiecze%c5%84stwa ) by a guy who was taking care of the local church . 
  he knew he was spied on since he was arrested and held for two months once for things he spoke about in private , but the documents only came in a few weeks after my grandfather had died . 
  the church guy died in the 90s , but after the news came out locals had `` donosiciel '' and `` agent sb '' chiseled out on his gravestone , until his family opted to remove the gravestone . 
  so far only old people with dementia or drunks tried that with me . 
  the only two documents which can be used to identify person are the id ( [ front ] ( http://i.imgur.com/giuoecl.jpg ) , [ back ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqlhtd0.jpg ) ) and passport . 
  driver 's licence is not considered to be identification document . 
  spanish is the most useless of the biggest european languages in eastern part of europe . 
  it 's from late 1800s, 
  these are pretty minor things , though . 
  i doubt most people would be able to name one thing on that list . 
  what else is there ? 
  i ca n't come up with anything . 
  also `` insulting the nation '' . 
  it 's meaningless and can be used very arbitrarily . 
  it 's treated as just about any good . 
  that means appropriate vat for sales ( 23 % ) and no protections given to actual currencies .
