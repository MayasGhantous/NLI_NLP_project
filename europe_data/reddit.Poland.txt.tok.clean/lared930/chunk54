  in terms of how much you can see nothing beats katowice-krak\u00f3w railway line . 
  60km in 2.5 fucking hours . 
  with that speed you can take a look at every fucking beautiful blade of grass on your way . 
  you can still find bagged milk , it 's rare but it exists . 
  i saw some in biedronka yesterday . 
  judging by his post time he is from the us .

  i 'd say most people can swim , some of them better than others . 
  as to schools in general it 's not mandatory . 
  in large cities you usually encounter an option to take swimming classes at school , some more extensive than oters . 
  at my uni i had to take half a semester of swimming to pass pe ( it was 1.5 semester of general gym exercises , 0.5 semester of swimming ) but again if you did n't want to you could just go for a full semester of gym . 
  despite all of the above i personally still ca n't swim very well as i prefer other sports . 
  at some unis there is a vague sense of identification , but for the most part with their course ( or what you would call a major in the us ) or maybe the department . 
  its scope is pretty much limited to helping others while you study , and maybe chatting with someone at work to see what changed since you 've left , some people also wear some related items ( i have a beer opener with the logo of my uni ) , but that 's it . 
  not much different than identifying with where you live or work . 
  i could tell you for an appropriate fee ... 
  ebay wanted to enter the online auctions market advertising , claiming to be the first service of this kind in poland . 
  they were not . 
  back then allegro was the auction site in poland . 
  everything was on there . 
  people did n't want to make a switch to a site which offers nothing new . 
  more than that ebay 's client service was notoriously poor , their website was harder to navigate than allegro . 
  and then they included per-auction fees , which was the final blow to their business . 
  [ you can see ebay next to the horizontal axis here - it 's the graph of number of active auctions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nsrwluy.jpg ), 
  i remember it about as well as bieslan and dubrovka to be honest . 
  and magdalenka . 
  they are called dresy over here in poland . 
  it literally means tracksuits . 
  but never with am or pm with it . 
  just the number . 
  phd students at my uni admit that they made more money doing internships during their bachelor 's than they make at the uni . 
  it 's all in the grants or extra work they do on the side , and even then unless you manage to do research for private companies ( which is fairly rare ) , you 're sentenced to being underpaid . 
  they are not the majority , though . 
  visegrad countries have very little in terms of common policy , too . 
   i ca n't see there 's much to lose from the european side . 
  except maybe some eastern european countries in particular , emptying . 
    even just for the uk , we get the right to live and work in the us ? 
  sure , i certainly do n't predict a flood of americans coming here bigger than the number going the other way , so what 's to lose ? 
  brain drain . 
  your engineers and doctors are going to move because they can make more money in the us . 
  you are the one getting the short end of the stick . 
  you have to be 18 years-old , pass a sight test , apply for a permit to start a course , pass a mandatory course consisting of 30h of theory and 30h of practice , pass a theory exam ( 32 timed questions 1-3 points each , 68/74 needed to pass ) , pass a driving exam ( tasks include following a lane , parking , reversing , general driving in traffic for ~ 30m as per directions of the examiner ) . 
  well , the current government ignores the constitutional tribunal 's rulings , so we currently do n't have much if that review ... 
  there are some in larger cities , judging by where they take their kids to schools they are almost all consulate workers or high-level managers in international companies ( at least in krak\u00f3w ) . 
  in poland prostitution is not illegal , but pimping and organized forms of prostitution are ( which you can see as a sort of protection from exploitation ) . 
  that means that there are no `` brothels '' per say , but there are `` social agencies '' which provide entertainment , including sexual services ( it 's a bit of a grey area ) . 
  what 's more interesting , prostitution is not something which can be agreed in contract , so by our law prostitution is not taxable ( as only contract-related activities are subjects to taxes ) . 
  the topic is not something which comes up often , or to be honest at all , in media . 
  there 's certainly stigma against sexual workers . 
  it 's worth noting that belarussians and ukrainians also get called ruscy , mostly because people ca n't tell them apart from russians ( at least not unless they live near the borders ) . 
  in poland the decision about what you want to study is actually usually done before entering high school . 
  different classes at high schools have different profiles , so for example mat-fiz has focus on mathematics , physics , while biol-chem on biology and chemistry . 
  of course that does n't bar you from taking matura exam in other subjects , but it makes it harder to make up the difference between what you studied and what you want to do at your exam . 
  in general if you are a good student in a big city you have some sort of target path , at first vague ( you have to have enough points on general post-middle school exams to get into a good high school ) , then more specific ( profile in high school ) and finally you decide what you want to study ( mat-fiz opens door to all kinds of engineering courses for example ) . 
  as mentioned above a mistake in choosing your bachelor 's will make it almost impossible to change courses without losing at least one year . 
  not on a larger scale , at least not in my region ( primary and secondary education is funded locally ) . 
  and do n't wear backpacks on your back when using public transportation . 
  for one it 's rude to other passengers as with each movement you can ( and in my experience , will ) hit someone , and you would n't notice anyone taking something from there . 
  stand just next to the tram door despite them not getting off the tram for the next ten stops . 
  the worst ones are the ones who do n't take the hint when several people shoulder them on their way out . 
  oh and there are the ones who do n't take their enormous backpacks off and then turn around hitting several people in the process . 
  * they are painted with the blood of the fuckers who stood there previously . 
  i believe there were 230 statues of him when he was still alive , so 600 is a very conservative estimate . 
  in scale from one to [ erecting a giant jesus statue ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xkxjp5n.jpg ) ? 
  you are talking about citizenship , not karta polaka . 
  these are two different things . 
  judging by your previous posts you do n't qualify for it . 
  you have to be a citizen of one of the countries created after the dissolution of the ussr . 
  and speak polish . 
  ukraine wo n't join eu within a decade either , even if everyone wanted to . 
  the joining process takes loads of time and preparations . 
  it 's been somewhat improving but it 's still far from acceptable . 
  cars are likely the most contributing offenders . 
  especially if you hate your lungs . 
  but then again like norway they 'd have to implement most of the laws of the eu ( the ones regarding toe common market ) anyway but now they 'd have no say in the council or the parliament . 
  you should search through / r/travel posts then . 
  there 's an average of one question like that a day , maybe two days . 
  i was taking about regular situations , but yes , i think the `` important objects '' are covered [ in this chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k2m2732.jpg?1 ) by `` zagro\u017cenie dla dobra prawnego '' or something like that . 
  the other situations when firearms can be used ( save for law enforcement/convoys ) are ( art . 
  45 ) : art 45 : - endangering the `` important objects '' mentioned above - attack on property , which at the same time endangers life , health or freedom of uprawniony [ firearm user ] or other also actions leading to the above . 
  - when the opponent refuses to let go of their weapon/bomb/other thing which might endanges people - when the opponent tries to disarm the firearm owner art 47 : - against an obstacle blocking access to a person who is hurt - in order to attract attention or call for help - to neutralize dangerous objects - to kill an animal endangering someone 's health or life - to fire warning shots so i guess that in typical home invasion situation it would n't change much , but you have a point that i 've oversimplified this . 
  burglary as such happens usually when there 's nobody home and the moment they are discovered , be it by residents or neighbours , they leg it . 
  when it comes to robberies and the like in the streets , you can use something like pepper spray , hope for the best , and run away making a lot of noise to attract attention of other people . 
  if you ca n't , you are much better off giving them your phone than getting beaten up , that 's the sad truth . 
  the law here demands that the actions countering the threats are to be `` proportional '' to them , for example if someone breaks into your house you can probably beat him up ( but not with intent to kill or injure badly , only to make him run away !, 
  ) , but never shoot . 
  edit : someone made [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k2m2732.jpg?1 ) about self-defence . 
  in order for the self-defence to be justified , you have to go through the green edges . 
  each rhombus is a decision . 
  the attacked person was the aggressor 2 . 
  you wanted to protect your life or health 3 . 
  your reaction was reaction to an assault 4 . 
  [ law term , ca n't translate without reading the whole ustawa . 
  i think it extends the second checkpoint ] 5 . 
  your actions were a response to a direct assault ( the response closely followed assault in time ) 6 . 
  your actions were proportional to the offence of the aggressor 7 . 
  your actions were absolutely necessary 8 . 
  you stopped your action after the aggressor retreated, 
  if someone breaks into your house and he does n't threat you directly , you should call the police and have them deal with it . 
  you ca n't use unreasonable force against him , like stabbing him , shooting him , or beating his brain out with a chair , unless he pulls out a weapon and threatens you .
