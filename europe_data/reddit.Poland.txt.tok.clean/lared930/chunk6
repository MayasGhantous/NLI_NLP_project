   [ ... ]  the ef epi third edition was calculated using test data from 750,000 test takers in 2012 . 
  the test takers were self-selected and no demographic information was collected on them . 
  the tests are used by the company for marketing and placement purposes . 
  in other words it 's shit . 
  shitty research is the most likely reason . 
  i 'll put the kettle on then !, 
  [ cat-deer  ( http://i.imgur.com/hlxgvkj.jpg ) marcin napieralczyk ( 30yo ) , a resident of teofil\u00f3w ( a district of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) will never forget that sunday walk . 
  as every evening , mr napieralczyk went out for a walk with his dog szarik . 
  he chose their favourite route through pi\u0142sudski 's park . 
  suddenly szarik started barking and something moved in the bushes . 
  `` i had never seen something like that !, 
  at first i thought it was a deer , but i was stunned by what i saw . '' . 
  according to mr marcin the creature which was ravaging in the park was a giant cat with deer 's antlers !, 
  `` i just stood there , i should have ran away but i just could n't have . 
  it was a fascinating view . 
  i feel that sooner or later we 'll meet again . '', 
  edit : i ca n't really find the salad of wrath scan , i 'll try again later . 
  we have been much weaker since at most xviith century . 
  the numbers and natural resources of russia alone give them a huge advantage . 
  `` i ca n't sleep at night because i 'm holding my wardrobe up ! '', 
  `` i ca n't sleep because my neighbour is torturing me with his heel ! '', 
  `` aliens tricked me ! '', 
  `` a cat tried to kill me because i was snoring ! '', 
  `` he went shopping but forgot to buy butter ! '', 
  `` a speck of dust has broken my arm ! '', 
  `` a cat-deer is ravaging in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ! '', 
  `` i beat up some germans because they were feeling up my sheep ! '', 
  `` a friend has bitten my dick off ! '', 
  `` i bought a salad of wrath ! '', 
  `` he answered iron instead of his phone ! '', 
  that 's just a selection of titles . 
  i might be ambitious enough to move my ass and do a compilation of these . 
  i wonder how they would classify `` id\u017a pan w chuj '' ? 
  a vegetarian option of basically any polish dish can be boiled down to \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka . 
  the winner seems to be the place right to the west of krak\u00f3w with 98,9 % . 
  please note what you wrote :  a partial federalization that will happen  west ( germany/france/some parts of the uk/spain ) is starting to be quite pissed this is all future tense . 
  i think for now his potential would be simply wasted . 
  he has to be careful to satisfy requests of most of the 28 countries the eu constitutes . 
  we had annexation of crimea , the fights in the eastern ukraine and not a single significant reaction from the eu . 
  it wo n't change any time soon . 
  you can see sikorski speaking but notice that there are no foreign ministers of other western european countries standing by his side . 
  it * might * change , but for now his position would be degraded to , at most , a barking dog which does n't have teeth . 
  his position is also not really representative of the whole eu , so he would be a tough sell . 
  to be honest there 's so much shit here that i tend to skip vast majority of the topics with `` russia '' or `` putin '' in the title . 
  a lot of them are cheap sensationalisms which would fit right into / r/worldnews . 
  it 's not entirely painless . 
  the staff had to be retrained to use libreoffice , this task has consumed 800 000 euro and 1.5 years . 
  most people looking for desk jobs learn office suite , not libre , which also requires retraining until the market catches on and people start learning libre . 
  to clarify i like the decision they made , but people almost always ignore these cost associated with migration . 
  the same goes for switching operating systems , people who work in offices have often worked with this specific software for years and do n't really want to change , even if they realise that the new choice would ultimately be a better one . 
  i can remember at least two situations like that over the last decade . 
  our thieves are very pro-bike . 
  was it a motorway , though ? 
  the laws regarding traffic are very similar to these in poland and this is certainly not a motorway by any definition . 
  edit : checked - m-600 trunk highway , the above rules do n't apply, 
  slightly off-topic - i love when reading something about romania a clearly slavic name of some location pops up . 
  it 's just so out of place it 's funny . 
  at least your coat of arms does n't look like [ something which just downed a shot of pure ethanol and is about to throw up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsbxvzn.png ) it 's still better than [ [ the chicken of boles\u0142aw chrobry ] ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/denar_princes_polonie ), 
  any change in constitution requires at least 2/3 votes with attendance of at least 50 % , impossible in the foreseeable future ( at least in regards to euro ) . 
  in poland it would be a political suicide for the government which does that , at least at the moment . 
  [ our prayers have range reaching russia thanks to this radar facility !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_the_king_%28statue%29 ), 
  they sound very silly in polish , like most other central and southern slavic languages . 
  please translate it to slovenian . 
  even the parties on thee ballot have silly names . 
  well , if it makes it any easier for you i do n't think i 've ever used the last one , but the other ones pop up every now and then !, 
  in polish at least there is a whole bunch of different forms of word two which can be used to make people who want to learn the language run away : - dwa - dwie - dwoje - dw\u00f3ch ( or dwu ) - dwaj - dwiema - dwom ( or dw\u00f3m ) - dwoma - dwojga - dwojgu - dwojgiem - dw\u00f3jka - dw\u00f3jki - dw\u00f3jk\u0119 - dw\u00f3jk\u0105 - dw\u00f3jce - dw\u00f3jko maybe only two of them make sense on their own . 
  i 'm sure most other slavic languages can produce a list of similar length . 
  at my uni people regularly come back with less than 20 ects a semester . 
  some fool who had been receiving scholarship brought back 14 ects and had to pay the scholarship back , to the penny . 
  also he should be called secret collaborator rather than coworker - he signed document signifying his will to cooperate ( reportedly he was forced to ) but there remain no documents pointing him as a person who actually provided any materials incriminating anyone . 
  some documents were torched in 1990 , though , as they had `` little operational value '' , so who knows . 
  edit : [ ipn materials ] ( http://archive.today/ch6c ), 
  the cost also depends on length , there are shorter and longer ones . 
  to be honest i 'd be more than happy with trams with nothing inside but these bars to hold onto . 
  the number of seats usually exceeds the number of elderly/pregnant people and the tram gets overcrowded ( especially as people flock to the doors for some reason ) . 
  hopefully they 'll be used as test pilots . 
  almost certainly polish , `` knowledge about society '' gave it away . 
  it 's a literal translation of one of the mandatory subjects here . 
  also , using my csi skills , i tracked his nick from imgur ; he might be from k\u0119pno , but that 's about a creepy as i 'm going to go . 
  but make sure not to arrive by submarine . 
  it reminds me of the police border wars between slovakia and poland a few years ago ( and maybe even going on now ) . 
  our countries have different requirements when it comes to required equipment , so there would be two hidden police patrols , one slovak and one polish , hidden at the side of the road , which would pull over only foreign cars to check if they have the required equipment . 
  i got a ticket for not having a spare light bulb for licence place illumination . 
  estonia has negative population growth . 
  you have to reach a compromise between having more children/allowing more immigrants in and convenience for employers . 
  in poland at least the salary for the woman on leave is paid from one of the government funds in which every single employed person has to pay , i do n't know about estonia but i do n't think it 's much different . 
  if you ask the employee about their martial status or kids you are breaking the law , too . 
  the ideal solution for you would be for women not to work until their children are self-sufficient or come back to work immediately after childbirth , none of which are feasible . 
  are you aware that maternity leave in many countries can be shared between mother and father , specifically to address this issue ? 
  is n't collecting money in order to pay a fine of another person ( perhaps an institution too ) a criminal offence ? 
  he said that the plane started melting , so i do n't think he overestimated danger . 
  the trapped man would have likely died from burns alone . 
   the government wants to organize third baccalaureate exam session a year to help more students graduate high school 58 % promotability rate this year is there one specific exam part which causes most problems ? 
  in poland 1/4th of students failed basic maths . 
  corrected . 
  [ according to the first responder ( a firefighter ) ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/ta-osoba-wolala-o-pomoc-mialem-ja-w-rekach-ale-samolot-juz-sie-topil,446800,s.html ) four people lived through the crash ; he moved three of them to safety , one person was already dead ; the second person died after being moved to a safe distance ; third person lived ; fourth person burned alive in the wreck as they could n't pull him out and had to give up due to risk of explosion . 
  ** poland ** * ^ incomplete , ^ feel ^ free ^ to ^ add ^ missing ^ news * - a plane with 12 skydivers on board crashed shortly after taking off , killing all but one of occupants . 
  some bodies can only be identified using dna testing . 
  the plane 's capacity was maxed out and probably an engine failure caused it to lose altitude , but the cause of the crash wo n't be known until a proper investigation is finished .
