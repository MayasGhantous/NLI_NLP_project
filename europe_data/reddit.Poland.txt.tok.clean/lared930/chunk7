  i was talking more of the eu alone rather than eurozone . 
  there is no internationally recognised scottish parliament . 
  if they want to do any international stuff now , they have to go through westminster . 
  decision to separate is an internal one , between westminster and the people who are citizens of the uk . 
  these are not legal technicalities , these are legal facts and you wo n't subvert them by saying `` i can '' . 
  would n't they have to prove first that their economy is stable ? 
  it ca n't really be done until they are independent .

  would it actually change anything ?

  you can learn something about life in austro-hungary .

  in poland events leading to the wwi and most of the war itself are not talked about , mostly because the events that took place near the end of the war were more relevant to re-establishing poland . 
  the focus is shifted to the events following the war and to the wwii . 
  and people have to bitch about something . 
  bitching about other people can fire back if they hear it , but the government is an easy target for shortcomings of any part of the administrative/executive/judicial parts of the country , or one 's failures . 
  also `` gdzie psy dupami szczekaj\u0105 '' - where dogs bark with their asses, 
  polish army is small and dominated by others in the region , pakistan 's and india 's not so much . 
  as if making nuclear weapon is simple . 
  we 'd need to get a special reactor and purifying stations plus nuclear fuel . 
  who would sell that ? 
  how the hell do you think you can keep it secret ? 
  no one would allow poland to continue researching , we 'd get either completely economically separated or invaded . 
  well , technically speaking i might end up being in the middle of my exams the whole july and august , so being in the middle of exams is not an excuse :d, 
  i would , but i 've already eaten it :(, 
  it 's also the night i do n't sleep because i have finals starting this week . 
  fuck me , i prefer studying at night :(, 
  changed . 
  thanks !, 
  i agree that the media had shitty coverage of the whole event . 
  until today 's press conference i did n't even know what exactly happened . 
  there were photos of swarm of journalists and the redactor holding onto his laptop . 
  it 's one of the reasons than when something like that happens i stand well back until at least both sides can say what just took place . 
  i 've prepared some notes about what the general prosecutor seremet said about the events during raid on wprost ( press agency ) offices , i figured that i might just as well share them here : - after the tapes were released , two investigations started - one about the government issues , the second about the person who taped the politicians . 
  in poland taping people is a crime carrying up to two years in prison - prosecutors who were dealing with the second investigation decided that the tapes released by wprost press agency are to be secured as evidence . 
  - in an unofficial deal with wprost it was decided that the [ [ abw ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agencja_bezpiecze%c5%84stwa_wewn%c4%99trznego ) will secure the data on saturday . 
  - two days ago two officers of abw entered wprost agency and asked to hand over the evidence - hard disk of editor 's laptop and some flash drives . 
  they did n't have search warrant , so they could n't remove the evidence without consent of the owner . 
  securing evidence in case of digital media means shutting down the machine and removing storage devices ; only originals can be used as evidence . 
  - claiming protection of press confidentiality the editor refused to hand over the materials ; officers left . 
  in polish law if a editor says that the material has data protected by press confidentiality , the evidence is removed regardless but is sealed until it can be reviewed by the court ; if the person who handed over materials is identified on basis of the evidence , the evidence ca n't be used against him . 
  if , however , the person handing over the data was not the guy who taped the politicians , he is not protected ( that 's the whole point of securing this evidence ) .
