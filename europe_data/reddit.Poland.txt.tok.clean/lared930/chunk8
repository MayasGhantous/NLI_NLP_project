  - later in the afternoon the officers came back , this time with a prosecutor and with search warrant . 
  the editor allowed securing data ; the technicians were not able to remove hard drive from his apple-made laptop . 
  they spent a few hours there . 
  - somewhere during the above but before the event below , about a dozen of policemen were called to provide security to the search team and prosecutor . 
  they did n't take part in securing the evidence . 
  polish law allows using force to secure evidence . 
  - after a few hours the editor changed his mind and demanded handing the laptop back . 
  it 's not exactly clear what happened . 
  anyway , according to seremet - the prosecutor asked policemen to take the laptop back . 
  they refused justifying themselves saying that they were n't taking part in the search . 
  abw officers attempted to take the laptop back at order of prosecutor . 
  a small fight took place , journalists swarmed the room . 
  the search team retreated . 
  according to prosecutors , they did n't order using force against the editor . 
  - during hastily retreat , the search team left a briefcase with unspecified content ; it was later given to the prime minister . 
  - a press conference was called today ; the above events were described with explanation about what the law said about the situation ( everything was lawful , but the approach could have been different ) . 
  seremet mentioned that the search team was n't suppressing freedom of press , the press were and still are allowed to make and publish copies . 
  they ca n't be prosecuted for publishing a copy of secured evidence , unless they stole it from the prosecutor 's office archives . 
  i 'd also like to remind that the above does n't contain my opinions - it is what i 've managed to collect from the press conference . 
  edit : bunch of typos, 
  it 's not a single person . 
  it 's the whole party . 
  think of how people perceive obama in the usa - they blame him for for things he is n't even responsible for . 
  it 's the same here . 
  he 's not an angel by any means , but takes a lot of blame for others because he 's the one people recognize and think about when thinking of po . 
  i think that the government wo n't be dissolved . 
  the situation calmed down a little , especially as some officials started making statements instead of journalists only . 
  some people might get kicked out of government , less likely from po , but it 's not as severe situation as it could get . 
  can you remember how people wanted to crucify the government when the plane with president crashed at smole\u0144sk ? 
  he 's been in power for the last 7 years , i think . 
  he 's unpopular with young people in particular ( but which politician is n't ? 
  pis is playing much more on religious values and national-oriented history . 
  they are much more vocal when it comes to solidarity and whatnot , you can see it even when they are not in power . 
  they are also much more socially conservative , so anything regarding gay rights/abortions/euthanasia would basically freeze or step back . 
  there might also be issues with foreign relations , but i think it 's changed since they were in power and ca n't really tell much about it . 
  voting far right will just fuck over regular people . 
  vote sensibly , not maliciously . 
  i do n't think that most people want kaczy\u0144ski , they want to get rid of the current government more . 
  unfortunately pis is the only bigger alternative party . 
  according to some records you could fit 5 people on one lance . 
  set a village on fire and you can cook some [ \u015fa\u015fl\u0131ks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shashlik ) !, 
  i almost feel bad for the guy who had to deliver the letter . 
  [ there was something similar in one of the films based on books of sienkiewicz ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nn-jekeomly#t=4550 ) ( subtitles are available , at 1:20:10 you can see the outcome ), 
  [ let them come , we 'll have a party again ! ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sgpdslq.png ) . 
  please note sobieski sending out for bitches and booze . 
  i think the best that can be done is writing up all facts on what leaked and what actions were taken ; as to the protests - they are by no means huge , at least not here . 
  there were barely 300 people in krak\u00f3w , that 's really just a handful for a city with population nearing one million . 
  monthly cycling gatherings get more people . 
  they removed medieval walls ; added gates , built a garrison building ( or a hospital , i ca n't remember ) . 
  it was also sacked at first , obviously . 
  if you 've ever been there you certainly saw outlines of stone buildings at the courtyard . 
  one of these was a church built in xiith century , the second one in xiiith . 
  some walls were removed ( there are photos of them existing ) ; there used to be only one way to get to the top of the hill , by the cathedral . 
  also it being a garrison did n't help preserving anything . 
  they did n't want to spend money to preserve them . 
  it was entirely doable . 
  the part is only left because one of the polish activists insisted on it . 
  the bastards tore down walls of krak\u00f3w and basically fucked up the royal castle . 
  they also built an ugly fortress surrounding the city . 
  i see that it 's the annual poles-dying-in-belgium week . 
  last year i think four people died within 5 days . 
  they had the longest cavalry lances in history ( up to 6.2 m ) , if you know what i mean . 
  ** poland ** ^ incomplete , ^ random ^ order , ^ feel ^ free ^ to ^ add ^ more ^ news - yestarday it was the 74th anniversary of the first mass transport of people into kl-auschwitz ( not to be mistaken with its subcamp kl-auschwitz-birkenau ) . 
  the transport consisted of 728 political prisoners , mostly poles but also 20 jews . 
  239 of them survived the war . 
  9 of them are still alive .

  27 embassies supported the march , the president of warsaw refused to take patronate . 
  as always there were some incidents of offensive banners and other things . 
  then they decided to divide loot amongst themselves at a bus stop ... right in front of the cctv camera . 
  they might face up to 5 years in prison .

  he tried to lose them ... by hiding at the parking lot of the biggest police station in this part of the country . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-chcial-sie-ukryc-na-komendzie-byl-pijany,nid,1440534 ) - a new law is to be introduces which would make driving without a licence a crime instead of a traffic offence . 
  i have no idea why it has n't been thought of sooner . 
  he claimed that it is against his conscience to give any help with regards to abortion . 
  by doing so he probably broke his contract .

  the law wo n't be changed within a few months , so for now whether to charge tuition or not is left as a choice at discretion of universities .

  [ [ pi\u0142sudski ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) might not have been the nicest guy around , with sending his political opponents to [ [ bereza kartuska ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bereza_kartuska_prison ) and [ [ invading lithuania ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski%27s_mutiny ) so that he would n't have to go through passport check when visiting his parents . 
  i 'm just using his reasoning to show that what he 's saying should n't be said in the context of this thread . 
  nazis also built some infrastructure - houses , at least one castle , they built numerous factories . 
  it does n't matter as all of that was trumped by genocide they were committing at the same time . 
  that 's also why soviets are remembered as they are in poland - they were not welcome and they stayed because of the terror they brought with them . 
  we were too weak after the war to repel them . 
  yes , they did repel the nazis , but then took their place . 
  they did n't kill as many people , but were still murdering . 
  i 'm saying that he 's a twat because he 's okay with violating basic human rights as long as someone builds something . 
  well , nazis also violated some basic human rights ( all of them , actually ) and they built something ( namely concentration camps , but also all the infrastructure to support them ) , so i guess by his logic we should be okay with that . 
  by your logic we should be grateful to nazis for improving housing situation in o\u015bwi\u0119cim and brzezinka ( german names for these places are auschwitz and birkenau , respectively ) . 
   maybe too much reddit/internet ... 
  b. . but it 's never enough !, 
  thanks !, 
  i try to do that when writing , but totally ignore it when reading . 
  because only reading was tested , i got classified as a yank .
