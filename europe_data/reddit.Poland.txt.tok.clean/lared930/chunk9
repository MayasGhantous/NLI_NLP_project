  are you , perchance , somewhat into sheep ? 
  i got american ( standard ) . 
  so much for learning bloody british english for the last decade ... 
  it 's an inverted k-pendulum problem . 
  the original statue is , i think , located somewhere in sweden , it was sold in the 1990s . 
  it looked [ like that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybgyozx.png ) someone also tried to blow it up , but ended up smashing the windows out of every single flat at aleja r\u00f3\u017c . 
  half of these are pensioners from the uk . 
  it 's the student town thing . 
  you 'll get by fine in krak\u00f3w , wroc\u0142aw or warsaw , but you 'll die miserably in smaller towns . 
  on the other hand you can also wave your hands until you 're understood , it 's a perk of italians . 
  it 's 89 % . 
  i think that it 's a bit generous to give 34 % to poland . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's like reading comments at youtube . 
  you can develop an aneurysm just from looking at them . 
   the police are getting a new , more modern , uniform . 
  i think it looks like they come from star trek . 
  [ 2 ] how many of your policemen ride bikes ? 
  i suspect quite a lot as they are [ trained in bike warfare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi1kdl9fa08 ) . 
  two weeks ago i was nearly depressed because i could n't find any hilarious police stories . 
  i guess that the journalist who 's paid for finding these took some time off . 
  damn it , i left it yesterday to write up on it today . 
  i 'll add it in a moment . 
  you 're right , i approached it from a bit too polish position . 
  ** poland ** - it 's hot - on 4th june we celebrated 25th anniversary of [ [ the first partially-free elections in poland ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_legislative_election,_1989 ) , which were one of the first events of the autumn of nations in europe . 
  [ [ extra photos ] ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vlnde ) - amongst the participants of the above event were representatives of nearly 50 countries , including heads of states of czech republic , france , germany , hungary , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , ukraine , usa . 
  - the constitutional tribunal ruled that public universities ca n't charge for getting a second degree . 
  since a couple of years ago you could study only once without being charged tuition . 
  the parliament is going to discuss how to make studying more than one degree at the time possible without possibility of abusing the system by , for example , studying 5 different degrees at once . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-drugi-kierunek-nie-na-darmo,nid,1439407 ) - according to the supreme audit office every third police car is a wreck [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-co-trzeci-radiowoz-to-wrak,nid,1439418 ) - a man was using a calculator whilst stealing from a shop , so that he would n't exceed the threshold of 420z\u0142 , which would mean that what he did was an offence , not a crime . 
  unfortunately for him , he 's made a mistake in his calculations , stealing 421.99 z\u0142 of cosmetics and now he 's going to face up to 5 years in prison for a crime of theft . 
  he is going to fill a complaint on the shop for incorrectly labelling the prices of items . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-kradl-z-kalkulatorem-w-reku,nid,1438278 ) - council of szczecin wants to remove monuments glorifying the red army [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-szczecin-chca-usunac-sowieckie-pomniki,nid,1439292 ) - 20 or 30 white lab rats were released by someone in krak\u00f3w , so when you get drunk and see white mice - do n't worry . 
  technically now it 's a tourist attraction . 
  presidents of poland and germany took part in unveiling one of the boards with the new name . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-autostrada-a2-atrakcja-turystyczna-dzieki-prezydentowi,nid,1439339 ) - after the chief of polish police , marek dzia\u0142oszy\u0144ski , advised policemen to suspend driving licences of the most dangerous road offenders , about as many licences were suspended in a month as in the previous two years . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-policjanci-masowo-odbieraja-prawa-jazdy-sedziowie-alarmuja,nid,1439318 ) - polish mines will introduce `` black boxes '' , which will provide records of , amongst other things , levels of dangerous gases . 
  they are meant to prevent falsifying records by the miners , as happened recently . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-czarne-skrzynki-w-kopalniach-koniec-z-falszowaniem-odczytow,nid,1439284 ) - about 15 thousand of xvith century books are in dire need of conservation . 
  amongst them are hand notes of the doctors who were using them as textbooks . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-bezcenne-ksiegi-wymagaja-renowacji,nid,1438795 ) - the commander of the us army is visiting poland . 
  the main purpose of the visit is to talk about the future cooperation of polish and american forces when it comes to training . 
  judging by the comments under the article - 90 % . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-co-trzeci-polak-jest-homofobem,nid,1438545 ) - a man left his dog for 10 hours in a car . 
  police have smashed one of the windows . the man was charged for the offence and might face up to 2 years in prison [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-pies-uwieziony-w-samochodzie-spedzil-w-nim-10-godzin,nid,1438305 ) - three highly ranked police officers were sacked after they were found drunk during the ceremonies of 4th june , during which they were responsible for security of 54 international delegations . 
  [ [ rmf24 ] ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-posypaly-sie-zwolnienia-za-picie-podczas-wizyty-obamy,nid,1438230 ) - after introduction of government-sponsored textbooks , some textbooks publishers announced layoffs . 
  it 's estimated that up to 5 000 people can lose their jobs until 2017 . 
  the brain drain happens in poland , too , despite us having been in the eu for 10 years already . 
  doctors , nurses and engineers can still make a lot more abroad , especially as some of the alumni of their universities who had already migrated can offer help . 
  there 's still a huge difference in wealth between here and western europe and it wo n't close soon . 
  sorry for being unclear - there are no plans to introduce government-sponsored textbooks in high schools . 
  i guess that 's due to differences in depth of teaching of different subjects , some schools would use r&h books to learn physics , the others wo n't really care . 
  would canada really be willing to implement a bulk of the eu laws , though ? 
  iirc he should get a job within three months , but it 's not really enforced . 
  the data does n't show the number of people taking the courses , it only corresponds with rate of people who get certificates . 
  there could be 11 people taking theses courses in poland and 10 000 in the uk , we ca n't really know . 
  there are two models of author rights - dual and singular . 
  in poland it 's dual - personal and financial . 
  you ca n't sell your personal rights to products , they also never expire . 
  you can transfer financial rights on specified fields of usage . 
  the personal rights are interesting , for example if the author had made a famous painting and some agency sold it for 500 000 euro , he or his family gets up to 12 500 euro from that transaction . 
  if he sold a book , he or his family gets 5 % from each sale of the manuscript and has right to supervise the work before it being published . 
  this would be against the berne convention , all signatories of which agreed to protect the copyright for at least 50 years after the author 's death . 
  look up your country 's copyright laws , they might even make this longer , in poland it 's 70 years . 
  selling the rights to the protected good also does n't void the creator 's rights to the product , in some cases if he claims that the product is `` misused '' , he can void the selling contract . 
  in order to be strategically effective - yes , they would have right to stay wherever they were needed . 
  by default i think that it 'd be most sensible to place majority of soldiers from one country of origin near this country but introduce rotation which would allow continuous training in joint operations with soldiers of other nationalities . 
  this would be a problem , but not within the next decades , as joint military would require much , much closer political alliance within the eu . 
  there wo, 
  would you fancy investing more in eastern poland ? 
  i thought that the subject is worth mentioning here since it has greatly affected the way europe is like now , and while i learned about the events in poland , i had n't really known much about the events in the other countries which participated until i read wiki articles . 
  it 's in the pdf posted by eurostat , liked in the article . 
  i do n't know how they do that , but to me most of what eurostat does is some sort of statistical witchcraft . 
  the statistics stand only for eurozone , which croatia is not yet a part of , and are seasonally adjusted . 
  i 'd still claim that it was unnecessary as the building was n't an immediate threat to the enemy forces and the attack did n't really commit much to `` defeating the enemy '' as the strike was not followed by any land attack . 
  the building can be refortified again without any problem . 
  you ca n't attack military targets if there 's a serious risk of injuring or killing civilians . 
  it 's a war crime . 
  he was found guilty of the offence , though , and he 's going to challenge the court ruling . 
  there 's also some kind of bridge-like game in silesia . 
  the play goes like that : a guy talks to you in a mix of polish , czech and german , and the ultimate goal is to figure out what the fuck is he trying to tell you and how the hell you play the cards . 
  after 15 minutes i think i did get the names of the card colours right ( i did n't know any german back then , it was years ago ) . 
  the game is called skat , i think . 
  edit : the germans somewhere else in the comments mentioned the game . 
  possibly so that members of gangs could n't just raise money for their criminal friends ? 
  the cited article prohibits public raising money for purpose of paying fines and previously mentioned paying for someone who is not a member of the family . 
  it makes it a bit easier to search for them later on . 
  ** poland ** ^ random ^ order , ^ incomplete - the standardized textbooks are entering the final phase of implementation . 
  the parliament decided that it will not subsidize any other textbook and that the textbooks are not going to be used in high schools . 
  the financing has been set up and the first set of books is being printed . 
  students will receive subsidies for foreign language textbook and exercise materials to accompany the textbooks . 
  the textbooks are going to be fully introduced in september 2017 . 
  the schools may use different textbooks if the gmina they are located in will finance them . 
  schools ca n't demand buying any other textbooks from parents . 
  - about 180 bodies were dug out near a jail in bia\u0142ystok . 
  the bodies belonged to three groups - victims of hunger and diseases ( including 50 children ) , victims of prl 's secret police executed in the jail and other unidentified victims probably killed by the germans ( possibly families of soviet officers or maybe executed members of polish intelligentsia ) . 
  ipn is trying to identify the bodies by means of comparing dna of victims with samples taken from known family members of people executed in the nearby jail . 
  there is a possibility of finding more human remains . 
  the grave site is unique as buried there are victims of the germans , soviets and ub . 
  [ rmf24 ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-jest-kolejny-przypadek-afrykanskiego-pomoru-swin-w-polsce,nid,1434205 ) - a director of some jail got into trouble because he paid a 40z\u0142 ( ~ 10 euro ) fine for one of the mentally-ill prisoners who was imprisoned for not paying the fine for stealing a 0.99 z\u0142 ( 0.24 euro ) chocolate bar .
