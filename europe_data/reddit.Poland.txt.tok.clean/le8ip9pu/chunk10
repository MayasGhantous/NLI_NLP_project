  some referendum maybe ? 
  honestly , if not nato there would most probably already be people republic of ida-virumaa in the region . 
  these conditions look pretty sane . 
  but the real question is : what will happen with people who wo n't get the citizenship for e.g. 
  10 years ? 
  maybe , just maybe , these videos are n't made for you nor other westerners ? 
  maybe they are made to convince russians that they are `` the good guys '' who get surrounded and that the threat of nato aggression is real ? 
  if these videos confirm what most of russians want to hear , then maybe they have a chance to be taken as facts instead of blatant propaganda ? 
  immoral people , often , but not always criminals . 
  i believe that every polish know about them and most of polish people condemn them without any doubts . 
  it was never hidden ( i believe that they appeared in many films about the war , they surely were described in books ) . 
  the main character of very good [ in darkness film ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_darkness_%282011_film%29 ) somewhat seemed to be initially motivated by money . 
  szmalcowniks were always considered scumbags and evil people . 
  [ armia krajowa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army ) punished this activity with death penalty . 
  * there were so called [ volksdeutsches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutsche#collaboration_with_the_nazis ) , polish citizens of german descent , who actively collaborated with germans and participated in the terror machine . 
  they were for example responsible for [ mass killing of other polish citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutscher_selbstschutz#ethnic_cleansing ) - of both jewish and polish ethnicity . 
  sorry , but they are considered traitors and not polish . 
  * there were few , literally few , polish people who were actual gestapo spies who had been infiltrating armia krajowa and were responsible for example for the arrest of [ stefan rowecki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_rowecki ) , polish underground army general . 
  * there were finally smaller or bigger acts of active hostility against jewish people . 
  sometimes it resulted in murder , sometimes in selling them to germans and in worst case in atrocity of [ jedwabne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedwabne_pogrom ) . 
  [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-jewish_violence_in_poland,_1944\u201346 ) gives some perspective ( 700 jewish people killed in years 1944-46 as a worst case estimate ) . 
  during the [ warsaw upraising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) alone , ** few thousands ** of german soldiers were ** killed in action ** . 
  these evil behaviours are marginal . 
  most of the society was passive ( some because they did n't consider it worthy to help jewish people , other were afraid of death penalty for them and their families ) . 
  some people , including our armia krajowa ( as opposed to the current [ german propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_war ) ) were helping . 
  few of polish were immoral scumbags who did evil acts and in biggest cases were punished for that . 
  we as polish are protesting against books of j.t. 
  gross and films like the * generation war * because they put things in wrong perspective . 
  gross selects true incidents and presents them as common practices . 
  the * generation war * makes the same sin as many western movies . 
  through the most of the film , germans are shown as sensitive , cultured , civilized people . 
  when polish people are shown , they are almost always scumbags . 
  then , such ** false image of polish people is taken and extended to the current generations ** . 
  would n't you be mad ? 
  the truth is that during the wwii the proportions were somewhat reversed . 
  ** put the bad acts in proper proportions and we will work through it ** . 
  try to whitewash your grandgrandparents and we will defend good name of ours . 
  respect to you . 
   so there were no polish guards ? 
  as far as i know absolutely not . 
  in some ghettos , there were jewish policemen actively helping germans . 
  i have no problem with recognizing them as polish citizens . 
  but is n't it a problem for you ? 
  because it would mean that polish citizens of jewish ethnicity should be counted as polish victims . 
  still , there were ** no polish guards in german concentration and extermination camps ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_poland#the_german_nazi_extermination_policy  the camps were designed and operated by nazi germans and there were no polish guards at any of the camps , [ 26 ] despite the sometimes used misnomer polish death camps at the east , there were ukrainian guards in some camps ( at least in sobib\u00f3r ) . 
  jedwabne is actually recognized by most of polish people . 
  most of us perceive it as an evil act and an atrocity . 
  still , if you state that responsibility for jedwabne equals responsibility for killing of millions of people in german operated camps , then you should revise your perspective . 
  i suspect that you are trolling and happy , but still : are native americans responsible for establishment and managing new york , boston , chicago and thousands of other american cities ? 
  just because these cities were found , mostly ** against their will ** on lands they lost in favour of europeans ? 
  these camps were ** found by germans ** on lands of ** conquered poland ** and ** operated by germans ** to fulfill ** nazi ( germans ) plans ** . 
  why most terrific extermination camps were found on these lands ? 
  because they were stinky - literally and morally - even for typical nazi supporting germans - so it was better to avoid doubts and discontent . 
   the death ratio does n't get that high without wholesale collaboration by government institutions [ ... ] there was no polish state and no polish government on polish territory . 
  there was a government in exile and it did n't collaborate . 
  as opposed to , for example , vichy france . 
   [ ... ] down to the local level - by the normal populace like in case of jewish people transported from france , belgium , holland ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france#vichy.27s_racial_policies_and_collaboration but stop !, 
  they were killed in occupied poland . 
  we have just taken their property . 
  it 's poles fault !, 
   poland remains a stubbornly antisemitic nation according to most polls that study the issue . 
  do you know that in occupied poland , germans would kill your entire family ( including small children ) if you helped a single jew ? 
  at the same time , in western europe they would slap you at worst . 
  would you help a jew in such situation ? 
  many tried , some succeeded and some died with their families . 
  but yeah , whatever , we are stubbornly anti-semitic scum . 
  it 's just so fricking frustrating to constantly look how guilts of nazis are tried to be transferred/shared to our nation , which actively resisted nazi germany during the whole occupation period and did much to help jewish people ( never enough of [ simple facts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/righteous_among_the_nations#number_of_awarded_by_country ) ) . 
  there are scumbags in each country and i know that there were much too many actively evil polish during the wwii but i dare to say that there were much more scumbags between austrians and germans ( at least during the wwii ) than between polish . 
  are you able to swallow such thought ? 
  or maybe the image of barbarian , jew-eating subhumans from the east is too strong in you ? 
  who wants to erase history ? 
  polish ? 
  germans ? 
  jews ? 
  gross ? 
  if you are talking about polish , then you are a proof that constant spitting and mud throwing are effective . 
  or maybe you are just throwing more mud : /, 
   thank you russia !, 
  you want some civilization ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  it 's not important that they were attacked by criminals and it 's not important that the same could ( most probably ) happen to people of polish ethnicity passing there instead of these turkish people . 
  they were our guests and it should n't happen . 
  but this is actually true . 
  they are outsiders from the margin of life . 
  i do n't know if you had a chance to observe `` classic '' criminals ( to exclude white collar criminals ) . 
  i was sitting for an hour in the same train car in which four , loud thieves were going back from their `` job '' in ne germany . 
  it was a terrible experience and your minds have literally nothing in common . 
  they are hostile aliens . 
   ~ ~ sadly ~ ~ the further up you go in age of our current society the more conservative people are . 
  fixed it for you  the point of view depends on point of sitting  one force pushes progressivism and the second force tries to preserve what was achieved by progressives of previous generations . 
  both forces are essential . 
   you really mean , a polish village with 1500 citizens , ca n't integrate a refugee family of 4 ? 
  really ? 
  that 'd be pretty sad . 
  where will this family live ? 
  in most polish cities , queues for social flats equal years of waiting . 
  in villages there are simply no social houses . 
  will houses be built for these refugees in these villages ? 
  how will it look for the people waiting in these years long queues ?
