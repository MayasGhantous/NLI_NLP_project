  til . 
  thanks . 
  there are n't many occasions to send our pilots to war areas where you can be shot down for true . 
  four is better than nothing . 
  maybe , with time they will get some non-reconnaissance missions . 
  war area is war area . 
  i think that it is a chance to gain some important experiences by our pilots . 
  our ground troops are already exposed to true conflicts for several years and they bring much experience from that . 
  shame it is n't used effectively by the old pricks `` managing '' the army at home . 
  as much as i distrust macierewicz , i like this move . 
  let 's also see what will come from his territorial defence plans . 
  they say his approach is n't perfect and that we should train guerillas rather than the main army support but it is still better than nothing . 
  what country is most hated in hungary ? 
  romania ? 
  and they say that the quality of posts here constantly falls , 
   why should we even trust germany , anyway ? 
  because , when truly lethal dangers start to become probable people and governments somehow start to act rational . 
  before ukraine no western europe country wanted to listen about any dangers coming from russia . 
  they wanted to see them controlled and domesticated . 
  now it is completely different situation . 
  of course there are some dumb people who are wanting to lift the sanctions , but i hope they will fail because it equals betrayal of ukraine . 
  that 's a wise post . 
  russia 's attack on romania , baltic states or poland would have to follow a series of events i could n't even speculate on ( because of lack of knowledge ) . 
  basically , there would have to be no nato . 
  it should be obvious that such country ca n't count on help of significant players . 
  in my opinion , joining the nato is the one most important achievement of the post communist poland . 
  this is why russia reacts so angrily for new nato accessions . 
  this is why russia is irritated so much about sweden 's recent shift towards nato participation . 
  it makes these countries so much more resistant to russia military games . 
  and russian rulers like to have a choice of potential victims :  if russia hates it , it must be good . 
  ahh , i hate how these noob ukraine and turkey are promoted in russia . 
  i hope that russians will oppose this propaganda and soon forget about these stars of one season . 
  well , after i read the comment you answered and your answer , i got that this is what you meant . 
  basically , i agree with you and this is how it is done . 
  these monuments were very often put in kind of communist monument museums . 
  they are symbols of domination and oppression . 
  should an abused wife bring a wedding ring afer she divorced her abusive husband ? 
  should we leave all these hitlerpl\u00e4tze after the second war ? 
  seriously , i never understood this preservation argument . 
  learn about evil people from books when you have such will and are in proper mood but do n't get reminded about the fact that they dominated your nation every day during your commute . 
  somehow , i think that the same map with the female form of the question would look much more positive ( forget the easiness ) . 
  thanks , 
  _ anglicy s\u0105 ... _ ( englishmen are ... ) * _ anglicy s\u0105 fa\u0142szywi _ ( are not truthful ) ( i do n't know the correct translation ) * _ anglicy s\u0105 g\u0142upi _ ( are stupid ) ( sorry ) * _ anglicy s\u0105 dziwni _ ( are strange ) ( not so bad , right ? 
  right ? ), 
  * _ anglicy s\u0105 brzydcy _ ( are ugly ) ( still better than dirty , but sorry ) _ szkoci s\u0105 ... _ ( scottish people are ... ) * _ szkoci s\u0105 sk\u0105pi _ ( are penny-pinching ) * _ szkoci jacy s\u0105 _ ( scottish people , what are they like ? ), 
  * _ czy szkoci s\u0105 sk\u0105pi _ ( are scottish people penny-pinching ? ), 
  again : _ to _ vs _ s\u0105 _, 
  do you suggest that i consider everyone handsome ? 
  :d the more probable reason of different results is phrasing : _ < some people  s\u0105 ... _ versus _ < some people  to ... _ the second one seems to be better choice for insults . 
  _ holendrzy s\u0105 ... _ * _ holendrzy s\u0105 przystojni _ ( are handsome ) * _ holendrzy s\u0105 wysocy _ ( are tall ) * _ holendrzy s\u0105 sk\u0105pi _ ( are ~ ~ scrooge ~ ~ stingy ) ( not sure about translation ) the problem is in the phrasing . 
  in case of _ holendrzy to ... _ you have bigger chance to get insults . 
  :d litwini s\u0105 ... ( lithuanians are ... ) * litwini s\u0105 przystojni ( lithuanians are handsome ) that starts to be weird  * litwa s\u0105siedzi ( lithuania neighbours ) * litwa s\u0105siad polski ( lithuania neighbour of poland ) * litwa s\u0105downictwo ( lithuania judiciary ), 
  no one expects the english pronunciation !, 
   for polish standards i am called a lewak ( leftie ) :d control question : do you support razem ? 
   i 'd be very curious to know how many of the `` jobs '' in the uk are actually zero-hours contracts . 
  what 's a `` zero hour '' contract ? 
  ok , found it myself in [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-hour_contract ) . 
  it 's pretty bad option for an employee for sure and it would suck if you ca n't get more stable work . 
  i can imagine this form to be useful to hire untrustworthy people or desired for people who want ( can ) work from time to time . 
  otherwise it is simply unfair . 
   do you think the russians thought the mass rape of women in germany was a bad thing ? 
  well , if i recall correctly , according to some women interviewed by [ svetlana alexievich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svetlana_alexievich ) , at least some of them knew that they act wrong . 
  some female soldiers told her that male soldiers , who participated in rape acts , tried to hide it from them . 
  obviously , because they were ashamed . 
  also the fact that russians do n't like to admit to this aspect of their victory over fascism says much about their perception of such behaviour ( and it ca n't change in several tens of years so much ) . 
  definitely rape of a german , polish or lithuanian woman is not something to be proud . 
  rape of an inmate ( both male and female ) or even a free woman or girl ( as much as she can be free in totalitarian regime ) by criminals is a whole different story but most of these soldiers were n't criminals . 
   yeah , this sucks . 
  no , it does n't suck . 
  it is actually a great backlash and a fantastic news for people who appreciate our cultural and national individuality . 
  we were taught for twenty-few years how bad it is to be proud of your heritage and of your country . 
  how the only way to be considered civilized is to abandon your roots and become a progressive cosmopolitan without any respect to your provincial ancestry . 
  people want to be proud of their country and nation . 
  they like to have these little , false and harmless stereotypes about their uniqueness ( hospitality , tolerance , exceptional braveness and courage , etc. ) . 
  when you are constantly told how miserable , worthless and evil you are , you often react with a resistance . 
  this is the true reason why pis won , in my humble opinion of course . 
  many people do n't like pis but they dislike the chocolate eagle , polish flag in a shit , constant deprecation of our heritage and all this modern `` patriotism '' bullshit even more . 
  i salute you , sir for this clever and funny joke !, 
  seriously , 
  but it is true if you simplify things enough  everything on the left of your position can be considered leftist or left-wing and everything on the right can be considered fascist or right-wing : , 
  pis won solely because of po, 
  there already were cases where the money people get from 500 + were proven to be misspent . 
  government through its social care organizations decided to replace money benefits with child products in such case . 
  the best of two words . 
  honest parents get freedom while the fate of children of pathological families is at least improved a little ( if this will be a common way of dealing with misspending then it may even improve the situation in families which would misspend otherwise ) . 
  this is a too short period of time to actually draw conclusions but it is stated by wide spectrum of media that the program is reasonably successful in increasing quality of live and possibilities of children living in poor areas and families . 
  the increase in birth numbers is a nice extra to it . 
  we will see if it is permanent . 
  we have 3 more years to observe it . 
  basically , if you see someone saying that 500 + programme is so baaad , then you can ask him/her what is the good thing the pis government did . 
  if there is no such thing in his/her opinion then you know much about such person 's intellectual honesty . 
  can you believe that one of arguments of fanatical critics of the programme is that it increased number of families going to vacation ? 
  really , some children may go for the first vacations in their lives and these people hate that because they make their own vacations less comfortable ( crowded summer localities ) . 
  i think ( just suppose ) that she was talking about that from the perspective of post war times - not the perspective of specific cases . 
  polish people , besides of well known and extreme cases like [ wola massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wola_massacre ) , mostly died accidentally and in smaller numbers , even a [ roundup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundup_ ( history \\ ) ) could be considered as such . 
  their death was often terrible , often cruel , children were killed in terrible ways , but still , we could manage and somehow rationalize it . 
  jewish people were exterminated methodically and in unbelievable numbers and the holocaust itself was a sum of so huge number of extremely evil acts that it had to change the thinking and identity of the entire nation . 
  just like prussian and russian [ persecution of poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-polish_sentiment#anti-polish_sentiment_to_1918 ) during [ partitions of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) influenced our identity . 
  in case of jewish people the holocaust had much greater influence on the entire nation - almost mystic . 
  this is what i think could stand behind her truly controversial statement .
