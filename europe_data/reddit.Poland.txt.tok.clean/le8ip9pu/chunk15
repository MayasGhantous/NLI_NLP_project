  edit : yes , i know that we were planned to be exterminated just after jews and russians , but it did n't happen and the nation as a whole was not aware of that so it could n't influence its group thinking and identity . 
  good , imo . 
  jkm is a joke who seems to consider himself intelligent because he is saying offensive stuff . 
  he acts like that for years and in my opinion he is the worst representative of poland in the eu parliament , ever . 
  i see this here again and again . 
  when we are talking about `` things that do n't influence [ pricks ] '' , proponents of the ssm somehow forget about adoption . 
  because in this part they try to show ssm as something completely neutral . 
  few sentences ( or posts ) later they say that to have `` true marriage '' the adoption rights are obligatory because otherwise it is not a marriage - it is a miserable and inhuman civil union . 
  this is manipulation , because if ssm shall include adoption then it involves a third party ( a child ) and is not neutral . 
  in the other case , there is suddenly no problem , you can have your `` marriages '' without great problem . 
  but somehow you are not satisfied with that . 
  somehow it is not truly equal . 
  somehow the not-so-neutral adoption is a must have . 
  of course the alleged neutrality of the ssm is still valid . 
  most of people in this oh-so-backward east really do n't care about these neutral issues like inheritance rights , registration , medical docs access , etc. 
  to be honest they should be praised for that . 
  because it is the true tolerance . 
  there is no problem with these things , so they do n't see anything against them . 
  they care about the not-so-neutral issues , like adoption and maybe tax benefits . 
  you ( proponents of ssm ) should probably exclude adoption rights from the ssm definition or resign from calling the ssm a complete neutral thing opposed from pure malice , hate and backwardness . 
  but this would require admitting that these `` bigots '' arguments ca n't be so easily dismissed as a whole . 
  i probably was n't clear enough . 
  while i do n't like the lustful and hedonistic behaviour of people in this kind of parades ( pride or techno ) i wanted my comment to make it obvious that i see it as only a part of this demographics . 
  in my opinion this smaller or bigger ( i do n't really know ) group of homosexual people make the general view of them unfavourable ( because of negative traits projected to the entire group ) . 
  this is just an observation . 
  it 's a pr problem of kind . 
   ** you are just uncomfortable with gay people ** and `` oh the children '' is a good excuse for you to feel like you are justified . 
  this is only your biased assumption and it is upsetting because i took a special care to disclaim that i have nothing against normal partnership rights and despite the disagreement on adoption i am fully in favour of fair and just treatment . 
  there was an right wing politician here in poland some time ago who tried to classify families ( not marriages , but marriage is basically a foundation for a family ) depending on the number of children in them but his propositions were n't taken seriously ( and they were classifications without further consequences ) . 
  preventing infertile couples from marrying ... this is a marginal issue and it would be extreme invasion in their privacy to determine if they are able or not to have children . 
  in case of people of same sex it is already known and written in papers . 
  but yeah , in case of infertile couples it is basically a partnership . 
  marriage is too closely related to children in my and many other people 's opinion . 
  this is the probable reason for the opposition for using this name for homosexual partnerships . 
   how does the relationship change because of the way the people have sex ? 
  the way these people have sex makes the relationship permanently barren . 
  this is a major difference . 
  as the main purpose the marriages are formed is to have children ( and rise them in stable environment ) it is justified imo to call it differently . 
  i think that it is simply about humiliating the opponents . 
  a revenge . 
  this is why i am feeling somewhat uncomfortable with all the normal partnership rights ( which i otherwise consider fair and desired ) . 
  it feels like a trap . 
  they ( civil rights ) seem to have minimal value to all these ultra-progressive `` human rights '' advocates and the possibility to adopt children and play the `` look we are just like mom and dad '' theatre is the grand prize . 
  somehow i suspect that the good of the children may also not matter so much for many of them . 
  still , i would support all the normal partnership rights here in poland minus the name ( to not suggest the false equality opening the way for adoption demands ) and the adoption being the red line . 
  btw , one thing bothers me for some time . 
  do n't you think that all these gay pride parades with their shocking aspect in a long range do n't work positively for perception of normal homosexual people ? 
  if they want to have an image of responsible and staid people which could be trusted to be given children to , should they at the same time promote the image of lustful and hedonist people ( just like techno parades participants ) ? 
  would you even consider allowing such people to adopt ? 
  and they are widely associated ( at least in poland , who knows how it is in xxi century / s ) with this image . 
  in my opinion it would n't work well for romania or poland . 
  we are the poorer regions of the eu , just like there are poorer regions in our countries . 
  it is very difficult for them to catch up . 
  it 's not in our interest to make it a single `` country '' before the development gap between the western europe and us decreases significantly . 
  the trick is to look at these questions from different perspectives : * most trustworthy - germany [ because current geopolitics ] * least trustworthy - germany [ because history ] we live here and we live in the past ( [ elbe slavs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polabian_slavs ) , never forget ! ), 
  here , have this +1 for it : , 
  according to the wikipedia , it seems that both belgium and france exploited it from the beginning . 
  was that really so scummy or maybe the location was chosen to make shared operation easier ? 
  i mean , it was built somewhere in 60s . 
  were n't belgium and france basically friendly countries at these times ? 
  i think that you undervalue this method of punishment and disagreement . 
  i do n't know if you are from poland , but do you remember faces of po and psl politicians when results of presidential and parliamentary elections were announced ? 
  it definitely hurt them . 
  major politicians kept their job ( but lost the power ) but secondary mps ? 
  they had to find themselves in a new situation . 
  also they were sure that they are not able to lose with anyone . 
  they had to feel that painfully and i as an ex-po voter ( 1st term ) was very satisfied by it . 
  regarding economic disruptions - i am also afraid of it , however we will see how it will end ( it is n't clearly visible imho ) . 
  so far the everyday struggle of many poorer people is much smaller . 
  will they ( pis ) be able to cover these spendings somehow ? 
  i hope so . 
  i am much more concerned about the international relations , especially within the eu , because they ( pis ) do n't deal with it good enough . 
   prosperity does n't come from economic growth , prosperity is when everyone enjoys the fruits of economy . 
  this sentence explains in a significant degree the change of the government in poland in the last elections . 
  our politicians , celebrities and kind of middle class ( this is by the way a strange , somewhat virtual concept in poland - everyone would like to belong to it and everyone defines it differently and almost no one knows someone who definitely belongs to it ) with some participation of normal people - living in few big cities - were benefiting from the transformation while `` lower classes '' , people living in `` worse '' voivodeships ( e.g. 
  [ west pomeranian voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_pomeranian_voivodeship ) or [ warmian-masurian voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warmian-masurian_voivodeship ) ) , smaller cities and in the country did n't gain very much . 
  additionally , their problems were addressed with unusual arrogance by politicians ( example for these of my polish compatriots who would like to argue : [ zmie\u0144 prac\u0119 komorowski ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhk_si27bjo ) - you do n't even have to click that , right ? ) . 
  all these po and leftist politicians supported and praised so much in the western countries are the main reason for the pis rule in poland . 
  by the way , i was reading your discussion with / u/slyscorpion and you actually convinced me . 
  the change of government was necessary to show the politicians that ( moral ) corruption will be punished . 
  the new government does pretty much pr related harm ( much too often in the foreign relations area , what especially hurts me ) but it also has a will to address problems of economical inequity and it does it pretty effectively . 
  sorry for the wall of text , i just wanted to share my thoughts as i saw a shared base thought . 
  looks pretty arbitrary . 
  there is also [ \u041c\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u044c ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mezen_river ) and [ \u0421\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0414\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0301 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_dvina_river ) in russia and something looking like [ delta dun\u0103rii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube_delta ) ( aka \u0414\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u043d\u0430\u044e ) . 
  the map author probably wanted to remove rivers for clarity but forgot about some of them , 
  the only children which are desired by almost every childless people are the youngest ( say 0-12 month - actual numbers taken from my ass ) and there is no surplus of them . 
  the reason is simple - the future parents want to shape and influence them . 
  they want carte blanche or tabula rasa instead of a constant struggle with heavily traumatized children ( sometimes openly hating entire world , including their new parents ) . 
  it does n't always work , even if they get infants , as these children are often disadvantaged and difficult to raise mostly because of alcohol and/or narcotics abuse or even lack of balanced diet during the pregnancy period . 
  i would be able to accept homosexual adoption of an older children but only with its consent . 
  name me a backward and barbaric but parents have an enormous influence on views and feels of their children - also in sexual aspect ( think about mother touching her son `` there '' for years ) . 
  homosexual parents may cause their children to lean a somewhat more into the homo side of the sexual preference spectrum ( even without a direct sexual abuse like in above example ) and this is simply not beneficial to the society . 
  as i said , in case of older children , let 's say 10 + , it could be their will but do n't kid yourself , typical homosexuals will want 0-1 yo children , just like heterosexuals . 
  there is no fun with having a 15 yo kid who calls you a `` fag '' constantly . 
  this is like a recipe to have a truly homo hating bastard . 
  rights : i fully agree . 
  there is however a difference between rights and privileges . 
  of course , it is a matter of discussion what is a right and what is a privilege . 
  is a tax deduction for partners a human right ? 
  is a child adoption a human right ?
