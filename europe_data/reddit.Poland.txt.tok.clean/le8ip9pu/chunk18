  will they leave to germany ? 
  so what ? 
  many of us would do the same - it 's hard to blame them . 
  poland is n't behaving as it should here . 
  this will be the true and irrefutable source of a true shame for dozens of years . 
  which is not pragmatic . 
  in my opinion we should only take the well verified , genuine refuges which would additionally behave like they are truly accepting their moving to poland . 
  i assure you that there wo n't be many of them . 
  10 per year ? 
  bad luck , we are doing our best . 
  with such approach juncker could only go and replace native population in his own bedroom . 
  yes !, 
  this one would definitely trigger a `` wtf guys '' reaction !, 
  but what is the name ? 
  [ \u0420\u044d\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0442\u0430\u044f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) ? 
  nah , they are n't considered our ancestors . 
  prussians or prussia were hostile or neutral most of the time . 
  making the [ kalingrad region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_oblast ) independent and naming it prussia would be silly at most ( while renaming germany to prussia would be alarming on symbolic level , but we would n't say `` hey !, 
  we are the true prussia '' ) . 
  oh , it was n't my intention . 
  i am just trying to understand why it is so important problem . 
  i guess that the reason for opposition is the same as in case of sneaky germans trying to steal `` our '' [ miko\u0142aj kopernik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolaus_copernicus ) ( or trying to sell us `` their '' death camps ) or shameless french trying to warm themselves in the genius of [ fryderyk franciszek szopen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_chopin ) . 
  not to mention treacherous lithuanians and their scandalous attempts to kidnap great [ adam mickiewicz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_mickiewicz ) . 
  yeah , i pretty understand the opposition to stealing of a symbol - just could n't find similar country-level case for poland . 
  may it be the same as in case of russians and ukrainians fighting for the heritage of [ kievian rus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kievan_rus%27 ) ? 
  i wonder how would some country in place of belarus have to be named to raise such fierce opposition from polish side . 
  mazovia ? 
  commonwealth ? 
  country of piasts ? 
  i have no doubt that a name which would instantly trigger polish people exist , still the greek opposition to macedonia is somewhat silly to me ( sorry guys , you can surely come out with some excellent name for the former soviet republic of belarus , 
  there are definitely such gypsies in poland . 
  they tend to keep together and still use their language between them but they have homes , cars , their children attend schools , they work and speak polish . 
  they are not assimilated and there are rare , local polish-gypsy tensions but they are totally not a problem as compared to their nomadic `` brothers '' ( who they tend to despise same as we ) . 
  polish-gypsy marriages also happen but they do n't seem to be very often . 
  it 's about the us for you . 
  it 's about keeping the big bad bear away for us . 
  a bully does n't like when its potential victims ally against him . 
  he tries to ridicule and intimidate them . 
  sometimes it pretends it is the victim who is hated by everyone . 
  we can only ignore russia 's cries just as we would ignore laments of a bully who ca n't bully around so much as it could before . 
  but , why ? 
  is she so antipathetic or it is the look only ? 
  is it too conservative or maybe it went out of fashion too long ago ? 
  as a person not used to this kind of clothes , i ca n't say what 's wrong here . 
  it is about constant lack of elementary respect - like in dysfunctional families . 
  you can see it even in this sub if you look carefully enough . 
  this is common perception in the eastern europe that we are the only people westerners can shit on without any social consequences . 
  sadly , many do it . 
  eventually , we will become first class europeans . 
  or not . 
  you should n't however be surprised that we sometimes say loudly that we are sick of it . 
  also , romanians have it much worse . 
  even in the eastern europe . 
  they have full right to be bitter about that . 
  this may probably happen to almost everyone and everywhere . 
  in my case it was chemnitz in germany several years ago and a pretty friendly bartender in an almost empty pub . 
  we were chatting a little and at some time he asked me where i am from . 
  poland , i said . 
  it obviously did n't compute - he said something about how cool is holland in his opinion . 
  not holland , but poland i said . 
  well , our chat ended almost instantly . 
  i do n't blame him to be honest . 
  polish people had very bad reputation in germany back then and it was somewhat justified because germany attracted tons of polish criminals at the time . 
  i can only hope that it is better , now ( it 's not in brandenburg as far as i know ), 
  i respect lithuania 's honourable and valiant behaviour in its eastern politics more and more . 
  it would be great if poland could act consistently and cooperate with lithuania in this area ( as well as others of course ) . 
  so ... it is basically useless . 
  thanks for clarification , 
  this is seriously confusing for me . 
  i know that we are much poorer than the western europe . 
  i may believe that an average pole is 4 times poorer than an average german . 
  i can even believe that ukraine is in such unbelievable shit , but is an average dutch 150 times more wealthy than average pole ? 
  is an average russian 10 times poorer ??? 
  are really hungarians and slovaks twice as wealthy as us ? 
  this seems to be one of these completely useless statistics when used for country comparison . 
  yeah . 
  even a fast wiki based research says that there were about 5-6 million of polish people killed by nazis ( including about 3 millions of polish jews ) and something like 350 thousands killed by soviets plus about 110 thousands executed in the [ polish operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd ) of 1937-38 plus up to 500 thousands of people died due to [ soviet repressions in 1939 -- 1946 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 931946 \\ ) ) . 
  this can sum up to 1 million in worst case . 
  ** the nazi score was 5-6 times higher . 
  ** additionally , nazis planned to completely exterminate us just after russians and other eastern slavs while soviets mostly wanted to exterminate our elites and minorities living on the area of soviet union . 
  nazis were much worse but it does n't mean that 1 million of us is nothing . 
  the difference is in current attitudes . 
  germans are basically sorry . 
  russians deny everything most of the time and seem to be offended that we do n't consider them liberators ( it is a generalization in both cases of course ) . 
  ** they were n't liberators . 
  they were just less evil or less efficient occupants . 
  ** what ss , wehrmacht and other formations did on polish soil is terrible but what they were doing in the east is unbelievable . 
  for this reason it is hard to respect most of nazi soldiers . 
  exceptions of humanly behaviour are way too rare . 
  at the same time , i would rather respect a simple soviet soldier who died in the fight with nazis if he did n't rape , murder and steal of course . 
  gosh , i really appreciate your effort to answer all these dramatic exaggerated opinions . 
  i afraid that the consequences of not-so-bright pis actions connected with cynical international hysteria performed by po will burden us for years . 
  the people like your parent poster seem to actually believe that we have no right to demonstrate and speak officially against our government . 
  the same is with the accusations of the anti-ue stances of the polish government . 
  well , let 's see how will our glorious opposition handle it when it 's their turn again . 
  i would say that it is perfectly rational and ok . 
  it would n't be a good government which would keep us in union which is not profitable ( in direct or indirect way ) for us . 
  did n't they have `` progressives '' before orban ? 
  it ended with some major economical crisis if i recall correctly . 
  is gay marriage worth it ?
