  so , if i understand things correctly , according to `` celebrating '' greeks , there were three options : * agree to requirements of creditors and suffer further cuts ( worst ) * reject requirements of creditors and suffer economical chaos ( bad , but not so bad as option 1 ) * reject requirements of creditors and because of some unspecified shift in creditors approach get some relief ( best ) . 
  well , in my opinion the third option is not so obvious ( why should such shift occur in the first place ? ), 
  and not so likely as greeks seem to believe . 
  even if both sides eventually agree , the time plays against greeks and weakens their position . 
  it is strange that greek people afraid further budget cuts so much but do not afraid much worse ( in my opinion ) economical chaos . 
  edit : removed badly balanced blaming . 
  still , i wish the greek people all the best and a fast return to economical stability . 
   to step down on your personal moment of glory takes lots of guts seriously , this is the part of the drama i do n't get . 
  how is the critical situation of the greek state and economy this guy 's moment of glory ? 
  how is supposed the fact that the greek people confirmed the `` no deal '' attitude to help in negotiations ? 
  where is the victory and glory here ? 
  because `` we will burn with honour '' ? 
  ok , as a pole i must agree that there is some glory in dying with honour :d , but it does n't automatically mean a victory . 
  really , the only thing , i can imagine , was in heads of people celebrating the referendum results ( confirming breaking of already broken negotiations ) was `` we shown them millions of our middle fingers and now let it be what has to be '' . 
  can you , please enlighten me ? 
  but do you agree that many could ? 
  they did n't do anything with it . 
  did n't make any spectacular explosion or beheading . 
  just lowered their heads and went along . 
  killing as a revenge for drawing images is extremely bad but insulting someone 's religion is very bad , too . 
  for many it is like insulting their mother . 
  nothing good comes out of such cesspit . 
  this image is not better in any way . 
  believers of these religions are not as vocal as muslims , so it may even make the author of this vulgar image a worse person than the author of the muhammad-manson picture because ( s ) he does n't even risk anything for insulting so many people . 
  he or she is not a fighter for any kind of freedom . 
  ( s ) he is ... oh , this is so stupid that i ca n't even name it politely ( in english ) . 
  i do n't know who has drawn this picture but i am pretty sure that i would n't be surprised about this person 's general political opinions when i eventually know it . 
  drawing and publishing of such images is plainly stupid . 
  one thing is to oppose radicals who are saying that you ca n't do perfectly acceptable things ( like drawing non-abusive versions of the ( islamic ) prophet portraits ) and other thing is a drawing of openly provocative and clearly insulting ( what is visible even for non-believer ) images with the sole purpose of showing disrespect and making fundamentals mad . 
  ** this image is insulting ** . 
  sorry , but people who draw and publish such things deserve a spit in their faces ( but nothing more !, 
  yeah , because the progressive indoctrination is not indoctrination at all :  most of the people commenting in this thread confirm that : , 
  there were also plans to introduce a special quota for boars in the [ sejm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sejm ) . 
  unfortunately , all the pigs outvoted it . 
  it seems that czech society is much wiser than its government and obviously has enough of historical memory to know how colourful and happy is the life in russian sphere of influence . 
  somehow , people fighting for bananas look much less embarassing and much sadder than people fighting for plastic slippers or tv-sets . 
  ok , so who these negotiators represent ? 
  for what will all this freedom for american corporations be sold ? 
  who will gain from this deal on our side ? 
    we `` know '' that you think about us in these terms but pc does n't allow you to say that . 
  this is probably one of the strongest reasons , seriously . 
  i am not saying that it is rational . 
  it probably is n't , however the fact that not so long as 10 or 20 years ago , people who did * these things * in occupied poland were living as normal , elder members of the german society somehow provokes such suspicions . 
    also , many polish people believe that germans are constantly trying to make us look bad in context of the second world war to look better themself . 
  you do n't do such stuff to a nation you like . 
   you 're writing it like we actually do that which we do n't , or i may just not be aware of it . 
  a pretty recent example is the _ unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter _ miniseries . 
  [ reception in poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_war#reception_in_poland ) . 
  there are news about such issues from time to time ( not very often imo ) and many polish people * believe * that they are not accidental , just like the famous [ polish death camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy ) . 
  i personally , do n't think that we must be liked by germans as long as we can live peacefully as neighbours . 
  we can do business with germans , germans can do business with us . 
  everything is ok . 
  there is also one totally fundamental fact which is crucial for improvement of our relations : the german state and germans as society actually acknowledge the atrocities made by ss , [ wehrmacht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht ) , nsdap members and others . 
  thanks to that the evil past will loose sharp edges with time . 
  you have to understand . 
  the second world war is a huge , collective post traumatic stress disorder for poland and polish people . 
  we need a professional therapy and/or time to deal with it ourselves , 
  yeah , you are probably right . 
  politicians here in poland are so full of themselves that i just like to dream about seeing something like that happening to them , 
  i , personally think that we are the one neighbour you would happily get rid of  still , my guess about the reasons standing behind typical polish person reasoning : * [ germanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanisation_of_poles_during_the_partitions ) after the [ partitions of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  * [ untermenchen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ) and _ polnische schweinen _ plus the extremely cruel and merciless treatment during the occupation . 
  ask your polish friends while drinking vodka with them . 
  we `` know '' that you think about us in these terms but pc does n't allow you to say that . 
  this is probably one of the strongest reasons , seriously . 
  * jokes about cars , lack of minority status , erika steinbach , some occasional jugendamt decisions . 
  * also , many polish people believe that germans are constantly trying to make us look bad in context of the second world war to look better themself . 
  you do n't do such stuff to a nation you like . 
  * finally , our inferiority complex . 
  tl ; dr : much of past bullying mixed with contemporary lack of respect and inferiority complex . 
  god damn it . 
  i only know its geographic position , capital and the look of its badass flag .

   former pm paroubek egged .

  respect to you czechs !, 
  i would love to see your political culture spreading over europe . 
  such lesson of humility would be useful for most of politicians here in poland .
