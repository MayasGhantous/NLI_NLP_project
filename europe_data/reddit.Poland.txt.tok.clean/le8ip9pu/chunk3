  i am fascinated by exotics of great distances and taiga . 
   maybe somebody can confirm this but in poland to call somebody a `` rumun '' is actually one of the greatest offenses ( it 's basically the equivalent of calling somebody a `` tigan '' in romania ) . 
  firstly , calling it one of the greatest offences is an overstatement . 
  i would say it is a medium level insult . 
  secondly , it 's weaker and weaker with time , mostly thanks to our friends in the west , who are hosting hordes of gypsy beggars ( previously plaguing our cities ) for several years , now . 
  it always was somewhat childish slur . 
  but it is true . 
  `` rumun '' has negative connotations ( dirty clothes , poor look , begging ) . 
  sorry about that . 
  personally , i have a positive feelings about romania and romanians , if it makes you feel better , 
  firstly , both of my kids already have special needs of different kinds . 
  secondly , children with the down syndrome are actually pretty happy . 
  they wo n't ever be you and they are dependant on healthy adults for entire lives but they rather not suffer . 
  thirdly , there are other children who * sometimes * really suffer . 
  i see many of them at the place i go with one of my sons for therapy . 
  i would never make a decision about killing them . 
  fourthly , i am not a german to take care for every child with special needs in the earth . 
  i do n't care about your extremist views . 
  i do n't care about your superiority complex . 
  i just reject the killing rationalized by someone 's own comfort ( because this is what they are really fighting for - an unlimited abortion right ) and feel disgusted by people talking about torturing and fragmenting fetuses in their bodies like they would talk about acme removal . 
  i know that sometimes abortion is required but do n't care about luxury of child-free type of people . 
  yes , just imagine the end of this thing in the soft head of this [ 3 month old `` thing '' ] ( http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_and_medical_reference/womens_health/pregnancy_your_babys_growth_and_development_months_1_to_3_-_12_weeks.jpg ) . 
  this is barbaric , this is inhumane and this is disgusting . 
  and i am not a supporter of a change in abortion law . 
  i am also completely atheistic . 
  but all this hate against these vulnerable , little beings . 
  it makes me sick . 
  do you actually believe it ? 
  i personally do n't believe . 
  if anything , they will eat some terrible medical shit which side effect is abortion or go to some underground `` clinic '' and perform the abortion in unhygienic risky conditions and by some butcher . 
  but clothes handers ? 
  please , why not pruning shears ? 
  can someone explain to me what are supposed these clothes hangers to symbolize ? 
  because everything i can think about is an abortion tool , what is too extreme to be its true meaning . 
  these monuments are of the * we were here , we dominated you , better remember it or we will rape you again * type of monuments . 
  they do n't want them at home because they would loose any significance there . 
  they want them here to remind us who is the boss and who is the bitch . 
  poland asked russia to take their [ phallic ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/6d/79/eb/z15432045q,pomnik-wdziecznosci-na-pl--zolnierza.jpg ) , [ ugly ] ( http://kierunki.info.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pap_czterech_spiacych_600.jpeg ) , [ totalitarian symbols ] ( http://i.pinger.pl/pgr126/8d799ca3000c6576492307c4 ) back home but somehow they do n't want it . 
  they want to keep their shit in strict centres of our cities . 
  i am happy that at last we will do something with it and sad that we had to wait so long for it . 
  all these diversity beliefs are silly for me personally but how could you know that they will replace them with less qualified people ? 
  this is actually a prejudice . 
  they can replace them with more or less equally qualified people of different ethnicity and it still is a disgusting discrimination . 
  because they would be replaced solely based on their race/ethnicity/look . 
  i was able to catch many single words and one phrase ( `` na adna strana '' ) . 
  it seems that bulgarian is pretty far from polish . 
  the natural dying out does n't work - just like in case of pathological alcoholic families . 
  they have time to corrupt the youth . 
  the only solution is to replace them all at the same time . 
  not that i am suggesting anything , though : , 
  i suspect that soon it will be a norm for newspapers to provide the ethnicity of sex offenders when they are white and omit it when it is otherwise . 
  it will be easy to read between lines for some time . 
  that seems to be a really terrible place - especially for children . 
  looks surreal , 
  this submission lacks some kind of background . 
  firstly , it definitely looks like some kind of organized effort ( and as such may easily be a subject of simplifications or misunderstanding unless well researched ) . 
  secondly , where are at least few words about these figures ? 
  they surely look fantastic , i would love to know something about them and find shared concepts ( there are obviously such , for example some kind of straw man , but i do n't know its meaning ) . 
   please you need to right-whine so more , your whining is so good . 
  somehow it looks that the humiliation of kaczy\u0144ski and his supporters is more important to you than well being of poland and polish citizens . 
  your progressive soul brothers from 1917 approve . 
  keep up the good spirit , comrade . 
   you feel so superior to the rest of eu , because you showed them middle finger , yay !, 
  i believe that almost no one voted against the eu . 
  people voted against the badly ruling , arrogant , worn-out po . 
  this is the main `` achievement '' of po and pis that they were n't able to see other options with a chance to take the power . 
   it does n't matter to pis/kukiz supporters . 
  german surname = evil nazi . 
  that 's simply a false and stupid statement . 
   you could distance yourself from germany without e.g. 
  attacking the free press . 
  even if they play dirty and actually `` attack '' , they do n't attack the free press . 
  they attack the propaganda tube of the previous government . 
  free press is fine , not touched and free to criticise the government . 
  they organise these manifestations , too . 
  no one persecutes them for that . 
  so please , do not spread such not true statements . 
   there is an extreme willingness on the german side to get the polish-german relations to the same baseline normalization that the franco-german relations have . 
  let 's hope so . 
  even the most `` hardcore '' members of the polish government do n't seem to consider germany an enemy . 
  in a recent interview , mr macierewicz , our national defence minister , said ( i am recalling it from my memory ) that we have too many military bases on the west of poland and there is no danger from this side . 
  his statements are pretty moderate and he is the `` insane '' member of the ruling party . 
  how do i understand it ? 
  germany is not considered a true danger ( and there is a true danger elsewhere ) , so a cooperation must be possible . 
  europe and germany just have to accept the fact that we are n't represented by po anymore . 
  yes , it may be inconvenient to cooperate with a little less trusting partner but the cooperation still must be done . 
   importing coal from abroad is cheaper than mining our own for gods sake ... yeah , let 's close our mines and import coal from ... hmm , maybe russia ? 
  it will be cheaper , right ? 
  honestly , the cheap coal could be imported but our mines should still be kept alive . 
  we should n't exploit it too much but rather keep it as our insurance . 
  it would include constant teaching of new miners and even bigger `` loses '' than now . 
  the coal is our only local energy source and as such is strategic . 
  if we close our mines we are putting our balls into hands of mr putin and our european partners . 
  i believe that we should still trust other eu members but there are limits of it . 
   it might be hypocrite for some poles to have that commissioner complain about these things now you touched the core of the problem . 
  we have been ruled in a really bad way for last 10 years . 
  po and pis controlled the narrative of mass media and made it look like there is only choice between mediocre po and evil pis . 
  no other choices . 
  any other choice is giving a power to po . 
  or pis .
