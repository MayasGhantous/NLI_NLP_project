  * _ respect by government officials _ . 
  basically , a single , simple mortal was no one in face of an government official . 
  as such ( s ) he was disrespected , treated as an intruder , forced to wait endlessly , to beg for positive solution of his/her problem and to _ wychodzi\u0107 spraw\u0119 _ ( walk from an official to official as long as the problem was somehow dealt with ) . 
  * _ corruption _ . 
  it was terribly common . 
  sometimes it was a bottle of vodka , or table of chocolate or a pack of cigarettes . 
  sometimes it was a quarter of a pig or a chicken , or a talon for some hard to get industrial goods and sometimes money . 
  the practical elimination of small corruption is one of greater achievements of the modern poland . 
  * _ forced attendance in communist holidays _ . 
  when there was a holiday important for communist propaganda ( like 1st of may or 22nd of july ) people working in big factories and other government owned enterprises , also schools , hospitals etc. 
  were forced to attend [ pochody ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/3/9519/z9519943q,pochod-pierwszomajowy--1968.jpg ) almost always under stupid slogans and often under portraits of [ murderers ] ( http://cyfroteka.pl/catalog/ebooki/41210/98563/ff/101/oebps/images/32.jpg ) . 
  i could recall more but i have to wrap presents for my children , 
  * traffic jams !, 
  streets in poland looked basically like [ this ] ( http://www.vw-oldschool.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1398335759_by_krzys_500.jpg ) . 
  sometimes like [ this ] ( http://www.nowastrategia.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/t-55a.jpg ) . 
  traffic jams were totally abstract . 
  * unbelievable variety and number of cars . 
  80 % of cars on the communist poland streets were from this pool : [ fiat 126p ] ( http://www.gieldaklasykow.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fiat-126p-01.jpg ) , [ fiat 125p ] ( http://autobox24.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fiat-125p-1988r-1500cm-1-w%c5%82.-19.jpg ) , [ polonez ] ( http://girlonline.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/polonez.jpg ) , [ trabant ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/trabant_601-s%c5%82.jpg ) , [ wartburg ] ( http://i61.tinypic.com/30m50g3.jpg ) , [ skoda ] ( http://www.czarprlu.pl/wp-content/gallery/nasze-pojazdy-moja-skoda-s100/skoda-100mojaa.jpg ) ( also newer model but i am not sure which ) . 
  the other 15 % were lada ( not sure about model ) , [ zastava ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/zastava_128.jpg ) , [ syrena ] ( http://klasykizg.pl/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/dsc_5711.resized.jpg?itok=bamctgsb ) , [ warszawa ] ( http://ogloszenia.ox.pl/files/notices/2014/12/08/warszawa-jan-pawel-ii.jpg ) , [ nysa ] ( http://truck-data.com/ltruck/nysa-522.jpg ) ( sometimes _ they _ brali do [ nyski ] ( https://img.czerwonesamochody.com/data/media/2/dsc02087.jpg ) ) and [ \u017buk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/zuk_p1000094.jpg ) . 
  there were also some buses and trucks . 
  but hey !, 
  they were available in different colors !, 
  see , we were living in a socialist paradise and we considered shitty sweets and coca-cola , which you obviously despise , a true luxury . 
  how they say it in poland : `` a satiated man wo n't understand a hungry man '' . 
  try to live in a `` socialist economy '' for 10 or 20 years and you will almost surely admit that capitalism is a pretty good thing . 
  polish people rather do n't consider themselves `` post-soviets '' but we were on the same side of the curtain , so i will still answer . 
  i was a pre-teen back then and the most amazing thing was the amount of cheap sweets available . 
  good , western quality sweets were luxury goods during the communism times . 
  they were brought from the west by contract workers and very rarely bought in the pewex or baltona shops ( you had to pay with hard currency there ) . 
  for our western friends to understand the level of luxury : * single package of [ these ] ( http://www.wzgorzasmaku.pl/data/catalogue/stltk5odc2nc1mb3rvlzi5otiuanbn.jpg ) made you a pretty rich kid . 
  you could exchange single leafs of these for really cool things . 
  * when someone was lucky enough to get [ one can of pepsi ] ( http://puszki.info/art/63117_pepsi-19xx.jpg ) or coca-cola ( s ) he usually did n't drink it . 
  it was standing in a visible place of a children room and was shown to guests . 
  sometimes they were even allowed to keep it in hands for a minute or two  when ( s ) he eventually decided to drink it , it was a family celebration and everyone took a sip from the holy can . 
   here are historical reasons for the `` hatred '' and it 's not really something that we take too seriously , unless it 's russians . 
  even in case of russians , most people rather hate their historical actions , government , army or past and current leaders than normal russians . 
  it is an often statement in poland : `` i do n't like russian state but have nothing against common russians '' . 
   i 'm doing the world a favour by adopting their kids they were too fucked up to deal with you said it two times and i believe that you are manipulating . 
  the children taken from pathological families are only part of these being in orphanages and sadly they are very lucky if they are adopted . 
  why ? 
  because they are n't infants . 
  even if they have 5-6 years old , they bring tons of major problems with them . 
  they are as far from good born children as possible . 
  sadly , they stay in orphanages until maturity . 
  would you adopt a children which requires serious psychological work to become just normal ? 
  which work will most probably fail and you will end with a teen junkie hating you and stealing your property ? 
  maybe even threatening you physically ? 
  this is how children from pathological families look like . 
  almost no one wants these poor beings and your gay friends would also prefer a healthy infant than them . 
  even very young children coming from truly pathological families are very problematic - they have very serious health problems . 
  bad mother behaviour during the pregnancy period ( alcohol , drugs , cigarettes ) often negatively influences their intellectual possibilities and also causes problems like adhd ( if i recall correctly ) . 
  so there is no debt of society . 
  everyone wants young infants . 
  of course there are exceptions . 
  there are heterosexual families taking and trying to raise problematic children . 
  i have also heard about a homosexual couple which did what you are trying to present as a norm and succeeded in it . 
  two or three children adopted by them found love and the purpose of living honestly and it was a good thing . 
  but such sacrifice is not a norm . 
  most of people , both homo and heterosexual want healthy , unproblematic , tabula rasa child . 
  there is enough of childless parents wanting to adopt unlucky children from normal or almost normal families , so there is no need for `` doing them [ heterosexuals ] a favour by adopting their children '' . 
  regarding everything else . 
  name partnerships of homosexual people marriages if you want but deal with the fact that in the eyes of many societies they are n't equally beneficial for the society so they should n't gain the privileges granted to partnerships being able to reproduce ( taxes mostly ) . 
  everything else ( medical info , inheritance laws , etc. ), 
  is their human right . 
  will they get tax privileges and a right to compete with heterosexual families for children adoption ? 
  it 's not their private stuff anymore . 
  in my opinion it is their private issues which no one should interfere when we are talking about living together , sharing and inheriting wealth , having an access to medical info and such . 
  tax privileges for families are supposed to support child births so they are simply not for them . 
  right to adoption is a delicate issue and it interferes with third person 's life . 
  it is also an ideological problem despite of progressives ' claims that `` everything is already proven : children of two gays are even happier than children of heterosexuals '', 
  it was said somewhere in this thread that there are very few children `` available '' for adoption in slovenia and all of them are adopted . 
  if there is no choice it is obviously better to have two dads than no dad nor mum but if a child can live in a better ( closer ) substitute of a normal family why to choose the worse substitute ? 
  for ideology ? 
  but really , despite of what germans would like to currently think and despite of all dark pages of the history , polish society is pretty similar to the german society ( at least in case of autochthonous germans ) . 
  it is absolutely not socially acceptable to beat a women in poland and i believe that the same norm exists in germany ( i personally know maybe a dozen or two of them ) . 
  if you would expect differences related to violence or crime , you would expect it to be statistically more often in case of polish people ( there are still way to many primitives here ) . 
  the difference between 35 % of german women experiencing some kind of violence against 19 % of polish women experiencing such is hardly explainable if you assume homogeneity in this matter . 
  the `` private hands '' were somehow hands of their dedicated supporter and the line of the newspaper and its accompanying `` uwa\u017cam rze '' weekly paper changed almost instantly after the take over . 
  they just did n't foresee that the authors of the `` uwa\u017cam rze '' weekly will all instantly move to a new , independent paper . 
  i remember how they , including komorowski being the president of poland at the time , urged voters to not go to vote ( in referendum about cancelling h.gronkiewicz-waltz cadence ) . 
  i remember how they thrown out literally millions of signatures supporting calling of referendums because they did n't like the purpose of these referendums . 
  i also remember how they tried to steal 2 seats in the constitutional court because something like 11 out of 15 was too few for them . 
  po was anti-democratic for years and all these `` defenders of democracy '' were happily watching it from their armchairs . 
  the people protesting have their right to fight the political force they are not able to tolerate . 
  pis supporters did the same during the muddy years of po 's rule but trying to use such hysterical statements and manipulating the western world to believe that we are one step from a fascist state is pathetic and dangerous to our country . 
  i really believe that nothing truly alarming happens . 
  i am not saying that what is happening is a good or desirable thing . 
  i am also not pis voter ( but i suppose that i may soon falsely claim that i am one just to irritate various , hysterical `` defenders of democracy '' ) . 
  pis does exactly the same what po with psl did and what pis did before and what sld ( post ) communists did before . 
  each of the wining parties try to grab as much of the power as it is possible . 
  each and every of the winning parties try to grab the public media to put its people there and have a free propaganda tube . 
  each of them pushes their social agenda using means they have . 
  every winning party replaces top managers of national companies and all top administrative officers ( to gain control and to reward its prominent supporters ) . 
  each winning party does it in poland ( and it is wrong ) . 
  unfortunately , the previous government has almost unlimited support of mainstream media ( what currently happens on very popular onet.pl portal is unbelievable - it is an alternative reality ) and as it can be seen they are also very vocally supported by the western left . 
  it 's po and psl ( which lost the power ) and sld ( which is n't even in the parliament after the most recent elections ) who act unreasonably and seem like trying to achieve abolishment of the legally elected government . 
  so can we agree that po is `` democracy breaking '' party , just like pis ? 
  not `` some people '' . 
  i am talking about the same people . 
  they are screaming about unforgivable breaking of democracy today while they silently approved the same actions taken by po .
