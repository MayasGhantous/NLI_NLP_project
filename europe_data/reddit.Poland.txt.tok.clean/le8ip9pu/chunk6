  surely : , 
  these `` worried citizens '' were n't protesting when po was `` breaking the democracy '' and stealing two seats in the constitutional court . 
  it 's about putting democracy in danger only when pis doing it , right ? 
  . hypocrites, 
  the people voting against po and their colleagues from psl and sld do n't want the old shit back . 
  they rather want to see representatives of these parties to be thrown out from each and every governmental institution . 
  the parties that lost the most recent elections are just trying to make it look like most of poles are outraged by pis trying to avoid the tribunal being owned by `` objective '' representatives of the previously ruling party . 
  the funny part is that the previously ruling party was a little too greedy and now they have no moral right to criticise pis . 
  all these `` defenders of democracy '' somehow did n't protest when their pupils were breaking the law . 
  hypocrites . 
  i do n't know , maybe they dream about abolishment of the government ? 
  it 's rather pathetic , because people did n't put them aside to give them back their warm stools a month later . 
  damn , looks like mordor . 
  finally the proof that we are on the side of the evil : , 
  from what i heard it is rumbly and hard to follow . 
  the main problem for me is that there are so many valuable books in the world and so little time to read them . 
  many younger people also seem to read less than previous generations . 
  to give them mein kampf to read is like wasting a limited and valuable resource . 
  it should of course to be used to try to understand how someone becomes a monster with power but in my opinion it would be better if they read some good book about history of the byzantine empire instead . 
  will i ever read mein kampf ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i am rather interested in what was happening in heads of russians actually loving stalin and germans worshipping hitler than what was happening in alien heads of hitler and stalin . 
  maybe . 
  i will decide tomorrow if i have to be ashamed , 
  there is actually nothing wrong in that they are trying to convince young people to their ideology - every ideologically driven movement does it and sometimes it even has some positive effects ( more respect to women and actual equality are definitely positive ) . 
  now imagine what would happen if something like that was done by a mild conservatists - promoting traditional values ( commitment to family , faithfulness to partner , religiousness , etc ) , but not condemning other ideas for life - just saying something like `` try to live this way '' . 
  black bible or mein kampf ? 
  / s disclaimer : i posted it despite rather than because of your flair , 
  i would like to ask our eu federalist friends to note the eu flag between polish flags . 
  two of them being ruling parties and one being degenerated , postcommunist left willing to sell itself for any office . 
  yay for balanced choice . 
  the truth is that po and pis made basically the same , so po may go frack itself with their complaints , now . 
  this is like a children fight and it 's started by po . 
  and no , i did n't vote for pis . 
  really , there is no such need . 
  [ \u0141aba ] ( http://www.piastowie.kei.pl/piast/mapy/1.htm ) ( elbe ) will be enough ( see [ polabian slavs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polabian_slavs ) ) . 
  the pig seems very pleased . 
  polan can into western culture !, 
  :  ( just kidding , it is wider than that : [ \u0434\u0430\u0440\u0451\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u044e \u0432 \u0437\u0443\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0442 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%bc%d1%83_%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd%d1%8e_%d0%b2_%d0%b7%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%8b_%d0%bd%d0%b5_%d1%81%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%82%d1%80%d1%8f%d1%82 ) ) the truly interesting thing is if equivalent of this saying exists outside of europe . 
  i bet it may also exist in middle east and maybe mongolia . 
   in my country there 's a saying : `` you do n't look to the teeth of a horse that was given to you '' [ rough translation ] . 
  is n't it beautiful ? 
  a saying with exactly the same meaning is commonly used in poland and it is at least as old as the times in which horses were commonly used for transportation and work . 
  i take it as granted that spaniards , french and germans have the same saying . 
   the united nations has condemned the new restrictions on travel based on nationality . 
  what is that ? 
  this statement smells poor journalism for miles . 
  they are not `` travelling '' . 
  they are trying to illegally cross multiple borders . 
  i do n't think that even un is able to make such stupid statement . 
  an ( s ) he automatically become one ? 
   give us an example of situation in which moral behaviour is one thing , and honourable is a different one and extension of morality . 
  a man has to defend a honour of a his lady . 
  not just safety but also honour . 
  an example : let 's say that a man is going with his lady and they spot few drunkards or other social scum and these people insult the lady . 
  even if there is nothing immoral in ignoring it and passing by or even running from the threat , a honourable person has to actively defend his lady 's honour . 
  i wo n't say you how is he supposed to do it but it is the principle . 
  both behaviours are morally good ( to defend a weaker ) but only the second one is honourable . 
  i suppose that you will also agree that punishing a scum insulting women is a good thing , so at least in this case it is harder to be good-as-moral-laws-says than good-as-honour-code-says . 
  honour is an extension of morality . 
  it 's harder to be honourable than `` just '' moral . 
  of course , rules of both honour and morality vary depending on actual social group identifying with it . 
  saying that * honour is simplification of morality for dumb people * is silly . 
  the author of these words is probably reasoning through simple they-vs-us associations . 
  as you surely know it , in poland , honour is commonly identified as `` right supporter value '' . 
  ( s ) he is most probably a leftist , so ( s ) he automatically disregards honour . 
  this is pretty dumb but whatever . 
  everyone has his own porno , 
  this an institution representing religion . 
  it can be trusted or distrusted just as everything else . 
  so called gender propaganda : , 
  i do n't think so . 
  they found a `` party '' on sale to avoid voting on pis or po or dead now sld ( never enough hoorays for that ) . 
  pis is part of the same establishment po , sld and psl is . 
  in my opinion . 
  they will rather not vote than vote pis . 
  on the other hand , there were some polls that said that something like 40 % ( haha ) of kukiz '15 electors have pis as the party of second choice . 
  still it is not a majority . 
   [ ... ] they do n't see our love as the same as their love ; it 's the institutional equivilent of your dad calling your partner of 30 years your `` special friend . '', 
  [ ... ] so it 's about name only ? 
  the rights are already the same and only the name differs ? 
  or maybe the rights are not equal ( child adoption ? 
  social benefits targeting families ? ), 
  and this is a method to extend them ? 
  i do n't know much about british law in this matter , so i am simply and neutrally curious . 
   your love is the same as heterosexuals you mean the love as a feeling ? 
  this illumination is one of the best imho . 
  are they able to put more complex images on it ? 
   why not to largely subsidize work for young muslims ? 
    because the anti-immigration folk are screaming [ ... ] a lot of countries have limitations on how much foreigners and immigrants can work . 
  when it comes to the refugees , they are often not allowed to work at all . 
  is n't the problem with second or even third generation ? 
  citizens ? 
  they have no limitations and still no job . 
   [ ... ] also if you are a brown middle easterner with a beard and a degree from the middle of nowhere , the first reaction in job interviews is often `` omg he 's got da bomb ! '' . 
  you ca n't say that this fear is completely irrational . 
  exaggerated ? 
  probably . 
  surely . 
  unfortunately there is a much greater probability ( still small but much greater ) of a muslim being a troublemaker than a white or asian or non-muslim black person .
