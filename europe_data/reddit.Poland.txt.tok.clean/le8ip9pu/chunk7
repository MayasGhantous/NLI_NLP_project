  so or so , i really do n't see any humanitarian solution other than enormous investments in integration . 
  oh , of course we can make a cultural surrender , too . 
   why not actively promote leaving muslim ghettos ? 
    because it costs money and the anti-immigration folk really do n't want it spent on immigrants . 
  the ghettos are really cheap [ ... ] that 's why these subsidized flats must be even cheaper . 
  it is investment in security now . 
  times are n't peaceful anymore . 
  some politicians must stop being bureaucrats and take responsibility and start being leaders making unpopular but necessary decisions . 
  otherwise other leaders will replace them and their methods may be not so humanitarian . 
   close the evil kind of mosques and their religious schools   it 's the 21st century . 
  the whole `` limit information '' was barely feasible centuries ago , you can forget about it today . 
  a lot of the indoctrination is already happening online . 
  this is like with kids and drugs/alcohol . 
  you limit access . 
  some of them , determined enough , will find it but some wo n't be exposed . 
  additionally it is a clear message to these hateful bastards : * we do not tolerate your behaviour and teachings . 
  stop or go underground * . 
  it would be better to put hate scholars in prisons , through . 
    showing acceptance and being inclusive . 
    you can forget about it at this stage . 
  [ ... ] this is why i believe it is the hardest part and if successful , will cost enormous money . 
  it 's however the only humanitarian one that i can see . 
   [ ... ] islamophobia and xenophobia in general did not appear yesterday , why is `` islamophobia '' so widespread ? 
  because in moderate cases it is not phobia at all . 
  it is a rational fear . 
  fear of hostile representatives of a pretty large group . 
  unfortunately , if you ca n't differentiate the dangerous , hateful muslim from the `` normal '' muslim and the only feature allowing danger detection is their language , skin colour and religion , then you ca n't trust any of them , thus the fear spreads over entire group . 
  you ca n't say it 's irrational when actual survival is in the account . 
  ** personally , i am very sorry for these single people . 
  ** i know very few muslims and the knowledge is rather shallow but all of them were pretty normal people . 
  maybe because they were living or studying in poland and had to talk and live with polish people because simply there were not enough of their brothers in faith or compatriots . 
  i rather do n't trust muslims as a group because statistics are n't in their favour and i * feel * that the extremist or fundamental part of it is greater than muslims are willing to admit . 
  still i strongly disagree with persecution of single innocent person just because ( s ) he is muslim and i believe that bad days are coming for them . 
   subsidize this , subsidize that , and tell me my friend , who will pay for that ? 
  the answer is , regular citizens who pay taxes and also often struggle to find a job and maintain it . 
  that 's sad , but when french have them already in france and they are citizens born there they have no choice . 
  they had choice when they allowed their parents in . 
  now they can only try to civilize them and it will cost them . 
  they ca n't exterminate them . 
  they ca n't throw them out ( because where ? ) . 
  the only choice french have to live in peace is to ** pay ** for bad decisions and bad approach in the past . 
  this is why i do n't believe that poland is able to deal even with these several thousands of migrants enforced on us . 
  our country will just give them place to live , maybe some benefits and will simply leave them on their own . 
  we are too disorganized to deal with migrants requiring special consistent care . 
  it just have to be done . 
  there is a great risk that with increasing number of attacks by radical muslims , these little less radical will become even more alienated . 
  in my opinion there should be an active , country sponsored effort of dragging them to the side of western society . 
  * why not to largely subsidize work for young muslims ? 
  i have heard that lack of work is a large problem for them . 
  if they sit on the streets or go to the evil kind of mosques , stupid things came to their minds . 
  if they work , they have less time to think about it , some of them are less angry ( because they may have better lives ) and more to lose . 
  * why not actively promote leaving muslim ghettos ? 
  subsidize small flats for them but scatter them on the entire area of a city . 
  such flat should be cheaper than rent in ghetto . 
  * close the evil kind of mosques and their religious schools . 
  preventing your children from contacting the rotten apples is also caring . 
  * the hardest , science fiction , part : make the society to believe that some of them may actually truly break with ghetto and radical attitudes and make the society to somehow reward them by showing acceptance and being inclusive . 
  this is where true , expensive propaganda is probably needed . 
  basically , the ghettos must be scattered and less radical youth must be dragged to the society side . 
  my opinion : * the first step is to always catch or kill directly involved . 
  * the second is to catch others involved . 
  * the third step is to learn from where they came . 
  * the fourth step is to go there and observe and prevent such actions in the future . 
  if they came from some of these hate learning muslim schools or mosques , then it should be closed or at least constantly observed ( all people going there should be treated as potential terrorists , too ) . 
  there is always ( i believe so ) a limit of such people and groups . 
  we just have to start actually fighting with them . 
  proper propaganda between muslims and proper care for their youth is of course needed , too . 
  their recruitment base must be made smaller and they must lose support from other muslims . 
  but the first thing is to start fighting with them and eliminating them one by one . 
  let they run to middle east , let they go to prisons for long years , let they die when resisting government forces . 
  it 's not important that he is delighted to die as a martyr if he actually dies . 
  it is great if he dies before he is able to kill anyone . 
   you are mixing people that had no choice in being the way they are and people that did choose . 
  this is actually a pretty reasonable distinction but not very precise . 
  for example religious people are raised in their religion from their earliest years . 
  they often ca n't change their religion without internal suffering or social ostracism . 
  if you deny it is a thing , then what about muslims ? 
  they have the same problems but stronger ( because there is also a death threat ) . 
  the same is with other beliefs . 
  you can be raised to be conservative , you can accumulate life experiences to actually believe communism is good . 
  the choice is not obvious and if you can just `` choose '' to stop being catholic or leftist you can `` choose '' to not `` be '' homosexual . 
  internally you will sill be but you will act otherwise . 
   are you confused what the word irrational means ? 
    it means without reason . 
  this is how i understand this word . 
  and a single person can have reasons to dislike some group and they may be perfectly ** rational to this person ** . 
  examples : * all polish people this person met were thieves . 
  * this person met two open homosexuals and they abused him or her . 
  * soviet russia or nazi germany attacked your country some years ago and did monstrous things to its population ( your grandfathers and grandmothers ) . 
  all these reasons are rational but related to groups you ca n't choose . 
   you can dislike any group you want . 
  but dont expect to have job safety . 
  i can dislike any group i want and unless i behave in uncivilized , socially unacceptable way , job safety has nothing to do with it . 
  1984 and `` thoughtcrime '' is not there , yet . 
  i am just interested if dislike to any group of people is irrational . 
  is dislike for gypsies irrational ? 
  dislike for germans ? 
  russians ? 
  polish ? 
  slavic people ?
