sometimes it does . 
  does `` n\u00e9met '' mean anything in hungarian or did you take it from polish or some other slav language ? 
   funny enough the semi vulgar term for germans is '' \u0160vabe '' if you had to translate the spirit of the word it would be `` fritz '' but literally it means people from swabia , a region in the south west of germany . 
  in other words our our official name for the germans is technically far more offensive than the semi vulgar name . 
  i polish it 's szwaby . 
  actually , immigration from vietnam is declining , most of them after they earn enough money , get back to vietnam . 
  there is a study about it by prof.halik . 
  but there are more and more chinese , there are some places near warsaw where chinese is more common than polish . 
  those are good immigrants , they are hard working , sell cheap stuff and have cheap , tasty restaurants . 
  do n't forget roman dmowski . 
  he 's being demonized by mainstream media but he was one of the most influencial politicians in history of poland . 
  it 's a shame that pi\u0142sudski and dmowski could n't work together . 
  and as a less controversial picks : [ ignacy paderewski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_jan_paderewski ) , [ adam jerzy czartoryski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_jerzy_czartoryski ) , [ wincenty witos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wincenty_witos ) , [ alfons zgrzebniok ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfons_zgrzebniok ) and [ wojciech korfanty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojciech_korfanty ) . 
  in southern poland we have anio\u0142ek ( little angel ) instead of santa . 
  i think that we should be as responsible for ourseves as we can . 
  sure , if idiots are running the central bank it would be disastrous . 
  but fortunately polish nbp 's and rpp 's fiscal policy is really , really good . 
  those are two institutions that are doing really good job , all the time . 
  and marit bj\u00f8rgen . 
  and lots of gas . 
  well , yes . 
  having your own currency means having your own fiscal policy , giving that up would be , in my opinion , a big mistake . 
  also , getting on sinking ship is not the best idea in the world , it 's better to wait and see , what happens with eurozone . 
  i know that germany wants to take poland aboard because it would make up for losses in southern europe but i do n't think it would be the best thing to do for poland . 
  it 's actually pretty nice , i like my beer cold and bitter ( ish ) but sometimes it 's good to have ol' good mulled beer with syrup . 
  do n't try it without syrup , it 's awful . 
  i really prefer using cumin , pepper , oregano etc. 
  count us too . 
  i hope it 's true , that would mean that it 's one of the ways i wo n't die . 
  also mulled beer , usually with ginger syrup . 
  i hate sangria , it 's too sweet . 
  barbarians !, 
  aw , yiis . 
  in poland we call it `` kwas chlebowy '' and it 's great . 
  personally i prefer lithuanian over ukrainian ( tbh i 've tried only obolan and it was n't that good ) . 
  vegeta is awful , everything tastes the same with it . 
  i love balkans and your cuisine but you 've killed polish cusine with vegeta . 
  in poland we eat usually with potatoes . 
  sure . 
  but there is always another way - renegotiating the accession treaty . 
  that would be another undemocratic action of our ruling elites . 
  only about 30 % poles are in favor of abandoning zloty , which is widely considered as one of symbols of our independace . 
  i 'm strongly against it . 
  edit : also , it wo n't happen . 
  they talk about it every now and then ( we were supposed to join euro in 2008 , 20010 , 2012 , now i see 2016 ) . 
  there is mustafa sese seko also in this book . 
  few days ago it was on / r/manga with all pictures included . 
  well , lithuanian minority in poland has those rights . 
  streets and towns have double-language signs and you can have a passport with your lithuanian name too . 
  poland : - strangers : handshake - relatives : handshake/hug/hug + kiss ( usually three times , but also two or one are acceptable ) for male-male ( some people just handshake , some only hug , some also kiss - three times , no more , no less ) , male-female hug/hug + kiss/only kiss , female-female hug + kiss/only kiss ; usually older generations are more kissity-kiss ; - friends : kisses for women + women or men + women . 
  handshakes for men + men - busines partners : handshake , if it 's a friend-partner might also hug + kiss but it was more common 20 years ago , kissing hand if buissnes partner is a woman is less popular ; - men + women : hug/kiss/hug + kiss/kissing hand is the most traditional and means a high respect to a woman , when it 's a close friend or collegue you kiss once on a cheek and/or hug , older people kiss three times ; - women + women : one to three kisses , hug - men + men : handshake , if a close friend hug , older people also kiss ( only three times , no more , no less ) - how many kisses ? 
  : nowadays usually one , two - sometimes but it 's not very popular nor is traditional , rather by mistake , three - the most traditional , when kissing man-man ** three kisses ** no less , no more - cheek , mouth , air , hand ? 
  : cheek , hand - after how much time of not seeing each other ? 
  : after a day , when it 's someone we did n't see for a long time or wo n't see for a long time hugging and kissing seems more appropriate , if you see someone on a daily basis you wo n't kiss that person three times on cheeks , one time is then appropriate , you also wo n't hug a guy ( if you 're a guy ) if you 'll see in few days - if he 's going away , just got from some far away place , then hugging and even kissing is appropriate, 
  poland - warsaw is the richest . 
  then we have other big metropolitan areas - almost all silesia ( gop or upper silesian industrial region - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_silesian_industrial_region ; 3,5 mln . 
  people ) , cracow , wroc\u0142aw , tricity ( gda\u0144sk , gdynia and sopot ) and pozna\u0144 are other fairly modern and wealthy cities . 
  there is quite a lot of competition with warsaw-oriented favoritism ( it is the capital so it 's kind of natural ) and more smaller cities start to catch up . 
  it 's easier to point out the poverty regions . 
  they were simply propaganda . 
  and a good one too . 
  far better than soviet or polish propaganda from 50s . 
  because it 's a good cartoon and some people are overreacting . 
  pomidor . 
  well , investors would mean that it would n't be nationalisation . 
  also - nationalising mean buying out current concessions from oil companies , which would cost a fortune . 
  moreover , greek government ( and a country as whole ) is extremely corrupt . 
  handling over any venture from private owner ( who is interested in profits and is concentrated on this one task ) to a state means a lot lower efficiency ( nepotism is very common almost everywhere , officials usually do n't have time to check every state-owned company , workers without proper management do n't work at all ) . 
  there is a reason why eastern bloc fell down and capitalist countries survived - it 's called private ownership . 
  that 's a relief . 
  racism is bad , sure . 
  but we should n't forget that there was segregation ( it still does exist but not to that extent ) or colonialism . 
  it 's like in the us they did n't show speedy gonzales in tv because it was thought to be racist ( the same was with some of bugs bunny episodes , where elmer fudd was shown as a black `` boy '' etc. ) . 
  they are products of their times - it was acceptable back then , we should n't consider them bad for containing some cultural baggage . 
  they are forms of pop-culture that show us how people thought back then . 
  censoring them would be a bad thing but we have to remember the historical context . 
  i do n't know why you were downvoted but it 's true . 
  and it 's pretty universal not only as a story set in poland but also on european ( or even higher ) level . 
  czech bard , [ jaromir nohavica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lurerxt-ehi ) . 
  god , he 's great . 
  and he also sings in polish . 
  russian bards , [ vladimir vysotsky ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gj3y-kv2e0 ) and [ bulat okudzhava ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ngey_hjuvk ) ( armenian/georgian actually and in this song he sings about poland ) , [ alosza awdiejew ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1wk9vrnt-o ) ( it 's a bit cheating , because he lives in my city , krak\u00f3w ) . 
  hungarian omega and [ gy\u00f6ngyhaj\u00fa l\u00e1ny ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgt-rtdkmcm ) . 
  it 's one of those songs that ** everyone ** in poland knows . 
  and everyone loves it . 
  netherlands , [ focus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4oupggli6q ) . 
  prog-rock is fairly popular in poland and most of fans love focus . 
  and this song is a masterpiece . 
  traditionaly it comes from lech . 
  derivation from l\u0119dzianie is one of the theories . 
  you can not disregard stories and even names from them as untrue . 
  currently i 'm writing about the ancient country of funan ( it was a preangkorean state in the mekong delta ) and i 've read a bit about beginings not only of funan but also ruthenia , for comparisment . 
  those stories , about the begining of a country or nation , are very meaningful . 
  we can not say if there was a person called lech but it 's probable ( there had to be a moment when slavs parted and newly created tribes went other ways ) . 
  but sure , i should 've brought it up earlier . 
  there is also a legend about lech , czech and rus . 
  they were brothers , lech saw an eagle 's nest ( gniazdo/gniezno ) and there he has founded first polish capital , gord called gniezno ( for hundrets of years religious capital of poland ) . 
  czech went west , rus east ( to kiev ! ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech,_%c4%8cech,_and_rus ) you can read it . 
  we really like czech ( s ? ),
