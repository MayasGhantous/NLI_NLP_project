  o_o as you can see , i 'm polish and patriotism is a key word out here ( and in central/eastern europe ) . 
  a politician that would say that he 's not a patriot would never be elected ( with a very thin margin for some representants of `` angry mob '' that can say anything and will be elected because they oppose to anything ) . 
  i am a patriot and i do n't know a person that would say otherwise . 
  but i was also shocked when a redditor form serbia said that in europe army is not cherished as in the us . 
  well , in poland army still is a * thing * . 
  most of poles are proud of our army and ashamed at the same time - corruption etc. 
  but it 's still polish army , one of the most important and coolest things in the world . 
  tehy are great . 
  but my all time favourite is [ louis de funes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmc4xahs_wc&amp;feature=related ) . 
  one of the best actors ever . 
  oh god , yes . 
  it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen . 
  but czech cinema was always very good . 
  about 14 % at parliamentary . 
  it 's something else . 
  actually - more . 
  and those two parties are hard to compare , they are really diffrent . 
  translation of this chart : 1-2 divorce is never an option 9-10 divorce alway can be justified miasto 500 tys .

  but netherlands was . 
  and then there was srebrenica . 
  europe could n't take resposibility in enforcing peace in balkans not because it did n't want but because there was no political will to do so . 
  and that 's why polish ex-pm stepped down as a un special emissary to bah . 
  techanically there was no eu back then , technically it were european states itself that were resposible for this course of events . 
  but if the reason for granting the eu nobel peace prize was no war on european soil west of elbe for 50 years , then we can say that the eu ( formally exists since 1 xii 2009 ) is responsible for srebrenica . 
  edit : ussr also `` promoted '' peace -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_in_the_soviet_union#peace-loving but it does n't mean it was a peacful country ( say that to afghans who are still in misery because ussr intervention ) . 
  exactly . 
  i just hope nobody will pick up her ideas . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftrqo-jkmpe ), 
  what complexes ? 
  russia is an authoritarian , unpredictable country that has got big rocket arsenal north from our border . 
  it should concern us . 
  and i agree that we should have good relations with russia as a state ( personal relations between poles and russians are just fine , e.g. 
  there are a lot of russian students and tourists in krak\u00f3w and zakopane every year ) . 
  and we are getting constantly bullied by them ( look at a gas contract signed by v-pm pawlak , look at tariff wars ) and it wo n't disappear by touch of a magic wand . 
  the same clique is in power for many ears , they wo n't change their views because there was a political will expressed by polish side . 
  well , e.s. 
  is part of german political scene . 
  and it 's bad , she should n't play any role at all but cdu can not turn their backs on her , because she represents quite influential and big group of people . 
  and the problem is that they exist in the first place . 
  i 'm just pointing out that it 's not only a matter of political gestures as in the quote . 
  smolensk is a big trauma on polish society but it did n't change anything at all . 
  especially when we learn about negligence of russian task-forces . 
  i think that opinion of russia in poland are worse than before the crash ( and certainly worse than right after the crash when we saw heart-touching scenes with rusk and putin ) . 
  i do n't see any right-wing paranoia in things that i 've written , i just think that this article is over-enthusiastic and does n't reflect reality at all . 
   the events of smolensk changed it all . 
  not only did russia and poland enter on a course of rapprochement , a major change in their mutual relationship . 
  well , no . 
  [ according to this ] ( http://kalkulatorpolityczny.salon24.pl/399682,chlodna-reakcja-polskiej-opinii-publicznej-na-zwyciestwo-putina ) 44 % think that poland-russia relations are bad , 39 % think that they are neutral . 
  we have one of the most militarized regions ( if not the most ) in europe just 300 km north from our capital . 
  russia constantly threatens poland . 
  germany is a completely other deal - it 's far more civil country but there are influential people like erika steinbach who are a big problem for poles . 
  revisionism does not exist in poland ( yeah , sure - we like to think about great poland but even nationalists usually do n't consider it as an option ) , we just would like to feel like home in wilno or lw\u00f3w ( it 's hard to get to lw\u00f3w because of insane border controls [ yay for schengen : / ] but people are usually friendly , lithuanians treat us like shit , when i was in wilno only friendly people were native poles and russians ) . 
  but we do n't have idiots like rudi pawelka . 
  and e.g. 
  and they vocalize that polish west territories should belong to germany . 
  it 's really sad that polish government abandoned `` polish ostpolitik '' . 
  we should stick with others who have similar interests as we - romania , bulgaria , baltics , georgia , moldova , ukraine ( but that 's another story ) . 
  sure , i agree . 
  that 's the biggest problem with so called `` young , educated from larger centers '' in poland ( and probably other countries too ) as well as the nouveau riche . 
  they tend to like gated communities , some silly brands and wo n't appreciate architecture that is n't trendy . 
  they want only new apartments and malls between them . 
  so everything is clean , flashy and looks like from ikea catalogue . 
  uniformity . 
  it 's a polish we thing - we really like to complain . 
  tbh , life in poland ( especially in krak\u00f3w and zakopane - i live in those cities ) is really cool . 
  and the crime rates are very low ( i 've been mugged in beijing and bangkok , robbed in italy , nothing has ever happened to me in poland ) , there is almost no job but most of parents are helping children for years . 
  it 's ok . 
  exactly !, 
  it 's a shame that most people do not like brutalism . 
  personally , i love it . 
  you 're welcome . 
  now , you 're the vulgar one here . 
  [ in your face !, 
  ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/165194/the-canadians-of-europe ), 
  for me it 's * this kind of music * . 
  it 's a novelty , like `` friday , friday '' . 
  i really like to listen to it with my friends over some schanpps . 
  as for your account name ... ottawa ? 
  or maybe copenhagen !, 
  as we all know , danes are canadians of europe . 
  and you think that rape dehumanizes a child that is a result of it ? 
  so if we allow to kill a fetus that comes from a rape why should n't we kill a child that comes from a rape ? 
  with assumption that life begins with conception we can not allow that kind of exception . 
  and i understand that being aware that your child is also a child of some animal is a huge burden - but it is still a child . 
  however horrible it is for mother , denying the most basic right , the right to live , is even more horrible . 
  and i support this too . 
  anti-abortion views are really popular in poland . 
  a lot of my liberal friends ( atheists , pro-lgbt , etc. ), 
  are also against liberalization of abortion laws . 
  it 's a matter of a principle and caution - if we 're not sure that fetus is a person , we can not assume it is n't . 
  also : john paul ii and creating the `` civilization of life '' opposed to current european `` civilization of death '' . 
  it may sound silly but my youth was filled with this man and though i was more interested in playing mario and reading sapkowski , i still have heard his teachings , which were present in every media possible . 
  this man had great impact on the way poles think about life . 
  he and adolph . 
  we were victims of mass murders performed by germans ( and soviets too ) , everyone here lost someone - and we were raised by our parents/grandparents who lived through that hell ( and the thing worth remembering is that connexion between grandparents and grandchildren in poland is usually very strong , i 've lived with my grandparents in one house ) . 
  takeo ischi is so cool . 
  the thing that most western people do n't know is that during the war , polish resistance was well organised . 
  the underground polish state had its own schools , courts and army . 
  and west knew about shoah well before the end of war ( which was a massacre mainly of polish citizens - of polish , jewish and other heritage ; after the war the state that never existed got money for most of those deaths , israel , not poland , which lost its citizens ) .
