  this map is based on work by two western anthropologists . 
  do you think that they made any research in eastern europe back in 1960s ? 
  i doubt it . 
  well , decisions of this weight - of course . 
  this is not a regulation of size of chicken 's cage ... 
  because eu is like that - sleazy and most of the decizions are made by some central comittees , just like in bad old times ... 
  i think that `` modelled after the us '' is just a rhetorical figure . 
  it would be more of a soviet union in a more righteous way . 
  very undemocratic , socialistic and inefficient but with functioning and quite good legal system and consideration for human rights ( the `` righteous '' part ) . 
  sure , i agree . 
  and i 've pointed it out earlier but in other words . 
  those so called `` elites '' are a bunch of really selfish , cynical and arrogant people . 
  most of people who run the media does n't follow the most basic rules of [ intercultural communication ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intercultural_communication ) . 
  those are things that are so natural for me i do n't even think about it . 
  it 's a thing that was pretty common in the past and it had other name - decency . 
  most of western media is just like the meme `` college liberal '' . 
  in this particular situation we have brits who manipulate some material they have to make poles and ukrainians look racist . 
  which is in it 's own way xenophobic . 
  but in a lot of cases integration does not work . 
  especially when immigrants outnumber local population . 
  [ myaaaaaaa !, 
  it 's called western-european cynism and cultural imperialism . 
  the same thing that led to the war in iraq ( well - it was a anglo-american version of this phenomenon ) . 
  racial jokes are very popular in poland . 
  but some real hatred towards foreigners is very rare - i 've never witnessed it myself . 
  we are usually quite friendly . 
  he has a point - french and uk 's immigration laws created a nasty enviroment . 
  ghettos in western europe are a fact and a problem which must be solved - the thing is that the most harm has been already done . 
  and that 's why democracy is fiction . 
  imagine this chick making any really meaningful decision ( apart from , erm , ` voting ' ) . 
  it 's because we know how marxism looks like in practice . 
  we still live ww2 . 
  and communism . 
  those were sad times and everyone know some people that lived back then . 
  and stories of hunger and death ... 
  it sounds somehow surreal ... 
  how about north zone of [ east-central europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east-central_europe ) ? 
  great news , i 'm really proud . 
  yep , i 've read that they are going to merge with npd ... lulz, 
  my result was kinda funny - i landed near upr but more anti-integrationist and a bit more right-winged ... 
  it happens that i should vote for die republikaner in germany . 
  you may have lost the champions league , but you are correct . 
  at least three kinds of meat , pickled cabbage ( `` sauerkraut '' ) , cloves , dried prune , some other spices , maybe some onion . 
  and yes , a lot of pure pwnage . 
  oh , i thought that france was the birthplace of the modern diplomacy ... 
  well , i 'm in my twenties and when i was in highschool i really could n't wait to get away from my hometown ( small mountain town in poland ) . 
  now i live in ~ 1mln ppl city ... and i really would love to live in a countryside but i know that i would n't do a career that i dream of in a small town . 
  and that 's a shame . 
  i 'm happy that i have a place to get back to . 
  then i ` vew been misled by polish sources . 
  i do not know lithuanian to check anything besides what 's given on polish wikipedia . 
  do you think it 's due to a tension between our countries ( or even nations - when i 've been in vilnus i 've felt that only people who treated me kind were poles and russians ) ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,4100164.html ) and [ this ] ( http://www.tygodnik.lt/200802/bliska4.html ) it is since 2007 . 
  national holiday in polish nomenclature is something diffrent than public holiday . 
  moreover - [ `` polish-lithuanian commonwealth '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) ( this is more precise translation ) was n't called that name back then . 
  it 's the same thing as with byzantium . 
  exempli gratia : in confoederatio generalis varsoviae country is called `` inseparable commonwealth '' ( `` nierozdzielna rzeczpospolita '' ) and in preamble it 's called `` inseparable commonwealth of greater and lesser poland , grand duchy of lithuania , kiev , volhynia , podlachia , with lands of ruthenia , prussia , pomerania , zhmud , inflants and crown cities '' ( `` nierozdzielnej rzeczypospolitej z wielkiej i z ma\u0142ej polski , wielkiego ksi\u0119stwa litewskiego , kijowa , wo\u0142ynia , podlasia , z ziemie ruskiej , pruskiej , pomorskiej , \u017bmudzkiej , inflanckiej i miasta koronne '' ) . 
  usually there was a distinction between crown ( poland ) and grand duchy ( lithuania ) . 
  so poles were often called `` crowners '' ( `` koroniarze '' ) ... 
  the main purpose of this constitution was integration of states but this reform was made too late and could n't change the course of history . 
  back then regional identification was crucial ( szlachta identified with their regions as much as with the country and king ) . 
  but both lithuanian and ruthenian upper class was polonized . 
  polish was mother tongue for most of them . 
  lithuanian was the language of peasants ( the same was with czech or slovakian in habsburg 's dominion ) . 
  oh , and 3 . may is a national holiday both in poland and lithuania . 
  not after [ constitution of may 3 , 1791 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ), 
  [ ;( ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/717/2sb75hf.png ), 
  polish ex-president aleksander kwasniewski was a member of communist party . 
  as well as few pm and many members of parliment . 
  for me they were servants of a totalitarian state with blood on their hands . 
  for many people they 're regular politicians . 
  in most of the post-warsaw pact countries commies ruled for many years after 1989 . 
  some cool polish patriotic-alternative ( it 's really good !, 
  ) : * [ schmaletz `` rewolucyjna nsz '' ( `` insurgent national armed forces '' ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k8d_t0fpx8 ) - about one of the main groups of anti-german and anti-soviet guerilla . 
  most of the songs lyrics are names of soldiers who died in action . 
  * [ dawid hallman `` gloria tibi domine '' ] ( http://www.twardzijakstal.pl/mp3/12-dawid%20hallmann%20-%20gloria%20tibi%20domine.mp3 ) * [ molik & pi\u0119tak & w\u0142asnowolski `` wilki '' ( `` wolves '' ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt9aae-p4pc ), 
  [ v\u00e4rttin\u00e4 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_jt5uhw_6y ) ? 
  there is hebrew version of kaczmarski 's `` nasza klasa '' . 
  and there are a lot of russian sung poetry translated to polish . 
  [ yep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxh7jlvdhc ), 
  why so ? 
  i 'm subscribing this reddit because i 'm european not because i 'm a supporter of eu ( which i 'm not ) . 
  so you basically say that you are up for central planning , yep ? 
  well my country 's economy for 45 years was planned by soviets and their puppets and it did n't turn out well - we still have a few years to catch up . 
  we did n't say fu to moscow so brusselss could do the same thing to us . 
  btw : [ waist management ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iznhqkduvho/tvo7ez9vlzi/aaaaaaaasva/mfz-iapifsy/s400/1.jpg ) . 
  we even do n't know what 's going on in netherlands . 
  not because we do n't care but because it does n't affect us . 
  your country is mentioned only when there is a rant against eastern-europe or an anniversary of arnhem . 
  why you downvote this guy ? 
  only because he has got different political views than you ? 
  there is a difference between considering yourself as a part of some group and beeing considered as one . 
  if someone feels more attached to an idea of british commonwelth - so be it . 
  i like to consider myself not as a `` european '' but , hm , `` centro-european '' ? 
  he 's cool , thnx, 
  [ german music kicks ass ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izibsmaqhey ), 
  okay , i 'll add some polish [ sung poetry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sung_poetry ) . 
  if you like bob dylan or leonard cohen , you should love those . 
  * [ jacek kaczmarski `` nasza klasa '' ( `` our class '' ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbnpbhzwh_0 ) - song about 1981 martial law in poland . 
  one of my favs .
