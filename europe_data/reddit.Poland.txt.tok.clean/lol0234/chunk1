probably top5 edit : [ you were 5th in 2014 ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/en/publications/reports/2014/020_14.pdf ),

  patriotism is not viewed negatively in poland . 
  [ according to this poll , 88 % of poles consider themselves to be patriotic ] ( http://www.rp.pl/spoleczenstwo/161119892-cbos-88-proc-polakow-uwaza-sie-za-patriotow.html ), 
  what 's wrong with being religious though ? 
  everyone is free to believe in what they want , so ? 
  i think it 's closer to 1,30 than 1,20 , but of course it 's still very very low . 
  really ? 
  i remember seeing the polls , where 88 % of poles considered themselves to be patriotic . 
  most poles like the country , but hate the government . 
   i blame pis in its entirety . 
  wtf ? 
  then look at the maps when po was rulling , you 'd be surprised we were n't the richest in europe lol . 
  and we mainly compare ourselves to czechs . 
  we 're not that interested in the rest ( as we know we 're poorer than germans or french ) . 
   poles think czech language is cute slovak language is also cute   nobody likes polish chocolate that 's it slovakia !, 
  i 'm not sure we can still be friends !, 
  wow , nice romania !, 
  i do n't see nothing wrong with it . 
  obviously only polish kids would learn it , so it 's nothing to worry about, 
  [ life expectancy is actually 73,94 for men and 81,94 for women , but of course the diffrence in retirement age is ridiculous . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_poland#after_ww_ii ), 
  well , maybe because it 's not an alternative ? 
  but imo it 's nice to have some sort of agreement between the countries in regions . 
  do n't speak about three seas initiative like it 's opinion of your whole country . 
  it 's just your opinion . 
  i do n't think it 's even possible that pis has so much support among 18-24 years old . 
  during last election , yes , pis won in this group age , but they had [ 26 % of support ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/wybory-jak-glosowali-mlodzi-a-inni-wyborcy,589048.html ) and it was the lowest support in any age group . 
  i love her facial expressions . 
  so sassy . 
  that 's great , congrats neighbours !, 
  yay , we 're not the worst . 
  wow , still a lot of people are leaving poland , but it 's good to see that more and more people come back . 
  ( cause i doubt that there are many dutch moving to poland ) . 
  krakow is the best . 
  i agree with you . 
  some poles will be back in poland , that 's for sure , but most of them will move mainly to the netherlands and norway . 
  we love irish , you guys would have been probably in top 5 . 
  last year , spaniards were in top 4 if that helps lol, 
  not sure , i 'd say for most of the students the second taught foreign language is german . 
  russian is often choosed , because it 's considered `` easy '' to learn for a pole , but later they realize that it 's not that easy . 
  i believe that russian is after english and german in terms of popularity , though . 
  primary school ( szko\u0142a podstawowa ) age 7-12 - polish and english gymnasium ( gimnazjum ) age 13-15 - polish , english and french high school ( liceum ) age 16-18 - polish , english and french in gymnasium we had to choose between russian and french , in high school - between french , russian and german . 
  xd good to know . 
  forgot to tell my sister not to go outside . 
  there were 1692 people in poland with my surname . 
  as for mom 's maiden - only 60 people . 
  [ here you can check it out ] ( http://www.moikrewni.pl/start.action ), 
  v4 , usa and germany . 
  zapiekanka and kebab, 
  second world war times . 
  i thought it was interesting to learn / read about it . 
  germany ( 6 289 000 ) 2 . 
  ukraine ( 1 265 000 ) 3 . 
  belarus ( 715 000 ) 6 . 
  lithuania ( 657 000 ) 7 . 
  italy ( 513 000 ) 8 . 
  france ( 506 000 ) 9 . 
  usa ( 474 000 ) 10 . 
  the netherlands ( 451 000 ), 
  football , volleyball and ski jumping probably . 
  nope , i live far from any church ( surprising , i know ), 
  siblings and cousins by name , parents by mom & dad and similarly with extended family . 
  ( aunts , uncles etc ), 
  germany , austria and france . 
  poland , also countries i consider our friends / allies or i simply like them - czechia , hungary , slovakia , romania , croatia , germany , italy , spain , ireland . 
  i 'm patriotic , but no nationalist . 
  historically : lithuania present day : hungary , probably slovakia and czech republic as well . 
  australia . 
  yeah , we 've only had one polish pope so far . 
  living : robert lewandowski dead : chopin or pope, 
  ok , i know this lol . 
  but it 's not how most of us see you guys , do n't worry . 
  most poles just pretend to be catholic though . 
   their fondness for a really cringey song from our country which one ? 
  libertarian right, 
  i 'd say most backwards people live in south east . 
  i mean over 50 % support for pis , over 50 % of people go to church on sunday . 
  i really doubt that there is more `` backwards '' , catholic and conservative region in poland . 
  yeah , can confirm as i come from the area that used to be austrian . 
  in poland , nope . 
  i guess it 's diffrent in every family here . 
  my dog is part of my family ,, 
  chemistry and biology, 
  today, 
  definitely swedish , tho i have to learn french and russian first . 
  i mean , it 's getting better , but far from perfection . 
  i have members of family who moved to ireland , france and australia , but those who are in poland live in 2 polish regions ( lesser poland and subcarpathian ) . 
  culture - slovakia ( but it 's my opinion . 
  i think culturally we are very similar . ), 
  language - czech republic and slovakia economy - definitely germany . 
  social connections - i think it 's obvious - hungary . 
  volleyball and ski jumping . 
  no and i never was . 
  slovakia and czech republic i 'd say . 
  kamie\u0144-papier-no\u017cyce = rock-paper-scissors, 
  french probably, 
  which means : why ukrainians do n't like dortmund ? 
  becauserussia , since `` bo '' means `` because '' in polish .
