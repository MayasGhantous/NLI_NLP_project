  `` how about ... a bucket of vodka ? '', 
  `` a cistern of vodka ? '', 
  `` then ... a lake of vodka ? '', 
  `` an ocean of vodka ? '', 
  `` but why ? '', 
  `` pickles not enough '' -- international feminist congress . 
  `` sisters , we need to stand up to the patriarchy !, 
  no more cooking , laundry , cleaning !, 
  come back in a week and tell us the results ! '', 
  after a week , the englishwoman reports : `` i came back home and said ` john , from this day onward i do not cook or clean for you ' . 
  first day , i see nothing , second day , i see nothing , third day - he boils himself an egg ... '' applause . 
  the frenchwoman has the floor : `` i came back home and said ` pierre , from this day onward i do not cook or clean for you ' . 
  first day , i see nothing , second day , i see nothing , third day - he washes his underwear ... '' applause . 
  the russianwoman speaks : `` i came back home and said ` sasha , from this day onward i do not cook or clean for you ' . 
  first day , i see nothing , second day , i see nothing , third day - i regain sight in my right eye ... '' -- a pole finds a lamp and when he rubs it , a djinn comes out . 
  `` i 'll grant you three wishes '' , says the djinn . 
  `` fine . 
  i want genghis khan to rise from the dead , gather his horde , and invade poland '' '' ... done . 
  what 's your second wish ? '', 
  `` i want genghis khan to rise from the dead , gather his horde , and invade poland for the second time '' '' ... right . 
  what 's your third wish , then ? '', 
  `` i want genghis khan to rise from the dead , gather his horde , and invade poland '' '' ... okay . 
  but why would you wish for that ? '', 
  `` it means he has to pass through russia six times '' . 
  yeah , correct , now it 's also played at every full hour . 
  at noon it 's transmitted by the polish radio . 
  it 's a popular folk tale , so yeah , there 's a ton of other works referencing it . 
  witcher uses , mirrors , deconstructs , or straight out parodies numerous legends and fairy tales , so that 's a norm there . 
  in particular , the short story `` the bounds of reason '' mercilessly deals with the dragon legends . 
  the wawel dragon reference in particular :  `` do n't insult me , witcher , i know what it is . 
  i 've seen it . 
  by chance i just came to holopole for the market and i saw it with my own eyes . 
  my ballad was already prepared , but you did n't want ... ''  `` carry on . 
  is it big ? '', 
   `` it 's as long as three horses , to the withers no bigger than a horse , but much fatter . 
  gray as sand . '', 
   `` green , then . '', 
   `` yes . 
  it swooped down without warning on a herd of sheep . 
  the shepherds ran away and it killed a dozen animals and ate four of them before taking flight . '', 
   `` it flew away ... '' geralt nodded his head . 
  `` that 's it ? '', 
   `` no , it returned the next morning , nearer to the city this time . 
  it dived down onto a group of women who were washing their linen at the edge of the braa . 
  and did they run , my friend !, 
  i have never laughed so much in my life . 
  then the dragon executed two turns above holopole before attacking some ewes in a nearby pasture . 
  what a lot of panic and confusion it started !, 
  the day before , well , nobody had believed the shepherds ... the burgrave then started to mobilise a militia and the guilds , but before he had time to organize them , the people had taken matters into their own hands and sorted it out themselves . '', 
   `` how ? '', 
   `` with a very popular method . 
  the master shoe-maker , a certain goateater , conceived of a means to finish off the reptile . 
  they killed a sheep then stuffed it full of hellebore , belladonna , hemlock , sulphur and shoemaker 's pitch . 
  to be on the safe side , the local pharmacist added two quarts of boil remedy and had the priest of the temple of kreve bless the offering . 
  then they staked the stuffed sheep in the middle of the herd . 
  to tell you the truth , nobody believed that the dragon would be attracted by one stinking piece of shit surrounded by a thousand others . 
  but reality exceeded our expectations . 
  forsaking the sheep that were alive and bleating , the reptile swallowed the bait along with the stake . '', 
   `` what then ? 
  tell me more , dandelion . '', 
   `` what else can i do ? 
  i 'm not going to stop now . 
  listen to the rest : barely enough time had passed for a skilful man to untie the corset of a lady when the dragon started roaring and emitting smoke from both front and behind . 
  next it did a somersault , tried to fly away and then fell down motionless . 
  two volunteers approached it to check if it still breathed . 
  they were the local grave-digger and the village idiot , conceived by the lumberjack 's daughter , a deranged girl who had been knocked up by a company of pikemen passing through holopole during the rebellion of the voivod tracasse . '', 
   `` what lies you speak , dandelion . '', 
   `` i do not lie ; i do nothing but colour gray reality . 
  there 's a difference . '', 
   `` not really . 
  carry on , we 're wasting time . '', 
   `` as i was saying , a grave-digger and a courageous simpleton went as scouts . 
  we then raised for them a nice burial mound , small but pleasing to the eye . '', 
  context : the wawel dragon is one of the founding myths of poland occurring in pre-christian times . 
  some of those were made up or rewritten quite recently , but they 're a huge part of polish cultural identity . 
  the story is quite simple : there 's a dragon terrorizing the city of krak\u00f3w , demanding virgins for meals . 
  the king offers his daughter 's hand in marriage to the knight who slays the dragon . 
  knights fail , shoemaker succeeds : he sets up a trap , leaving a fake sheep filled with pitch and sulfur for the dragon to eat . 
  the dragon eats the `` sheep '' and can not quench his thirst , so he drinks the whole of the vistula river and blows up . 
  there are many other references , though . 
  first is hejna\u0142 mariacki - the trumpet call played every day at every hour from the st. mary 's church tower at the market square in krak\u00f3w . 
  to commemorate the trumpeter who played it in the xiiith century to warn the city about the mongol invasion , the piece cuts short in the moment the legendary historical trumpeter got shot with an arrow . 
  the dragon 's name , adolf kamczatkow , is self-explanatory : it reflects the historical situation of germany and russia being the two greatest threats to poland . 
  the song played in the credits is a cover of [ `` cichosza '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m98mbace1xk ) by grzegorz turnau , a popular and lyrical song from the '90s that can be interpreted as a description of the polish society after the communism has washed out the intellectual side of polish culture ( as woul dindicate the grammatically incorrerct forms used in the song , and , well , the lyrics describing the absence of great poets ) . 
  also in the media coverage montage : sheep , straight from the legend . 
  social media montage is full of polish memes and `` spirit '' ( using typical names , phrases ) . 
  the dragon sings a popular song from the early 80 's [ `` najwi\u0119cej witaminy maj\u0105 polskie dziewczyny '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qskk0nzb-60 ) with a peculiar fake german-russian accent . 
  cinematography : although the color palette is your typical hollywood blue-and-orange , there 's some obvious anime inspirations ( ghost in the shell , etc. ), 
  in the `` workshop '' scenes . 
  i mean , if you 're filming something with robots and futuristic helicopters , then you 're basing your vision either on anime or on people who based their works on anime . 
  other than that , the overall effect is ... mediocre . 
  as it was with ambition , bagi\u0144ski is unable to make a convincing live-action piece without wooden acting and overdone effects . 
  imo he should stick with cgi . 
  live action is not his thing . 
  the border . 
  crowded part is romania , empty part is moldova and ukraine . 
  the white gap northwest to it are the carpathian mountains . 
  most romanians live on the southeastern side of the carpathians , by one of the countless small rivers that flow from the carpathians to the black sea . 
  the southern part of the `` banana '' is the riverside of dunabe ( dunaj ) . 
  you can expect more unified v4 policy on the subject .
