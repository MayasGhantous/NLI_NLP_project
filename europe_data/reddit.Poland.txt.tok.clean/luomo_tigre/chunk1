ozon layer is depleting and stuff , so maybe space will into poland ? 
   antifa ftfy aaah yes , antifa guys are well know provocateurs who happen to stir riots with our glorious patriots , even when they are nowhere in sight . 
  like last year when intentionally there was no anti demonstration , yet proud descendants of winged hussars happened to fuck up a large part of the city center . 
  let us add antifa to the long list of people and things that * always * manage to provoke otherwise peaceful and serene polish nationalists : undercover cops , blacks , geys , leftist , jews , feminists , tvn , [ tvn broadcasting trucks ] ( http://r-scale-8b.dcs.redcdn.pl/scale/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/e/e/eea184d0d8c6ecc0b650524fa3b3607d.jpg?type=1&amp;srcmode=4&amp;srcx=0/1&amp;srcy=0/1&amp;srcw=640&amp;srch=2000&amp;dstw=640&amp;dsth=2000 ) , [ street furniture ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/670/0/newsweek/635513335970131828.jpg ) , [ larg inanimate objects ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/14936/m14936670,klm-9109a.jpg ) and definitely my favorite [ journalists from conservative internet tv trying to praise peacful and serene polish nationalists ] ( http://youtu.be/0q49he7l5fq ) . 
  [ yup , that is why we send our finest linguists to uk ] ( http://youtu.be/fq80iwtoxmi ), 
  ** the polish gambit ** * act i * poland : `` we have some serious concerns accepting refugees , because economical/cultural reasons and stuff ... oh , and btw . 
  even if we did , it would be a purely symbolical gesture , because they would be on a train to germany the very next day '' . 
  germany : `` wait what ?!, 
  are you saying that you 're not willing to accept any refugees even though you know it 's a < < purely symbolical gesture   ... 
  wtf ?! '', 
  poland : `` yeah exactly !, 
  fuck you and all those brown/chocolate people . 
  you deal with it !, 
  oh , and when you 're at it , please do n't forget to send us this big fat check we get from you at the end of every month . 
  sincerely yours , the country that exported around 2 million economic migrants into western europe in the last few years . 
  xoxo '' germany : `` o_o '' * curtain * < slow clap  * act ii * poland : [ `` ratujcie mnieeee !!!, 
  niemcy mnie bij\u0105 '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgrvjna5qh8 ) * curtain * < standing ovation  context : the video i linked is an evidence of a fairly famous affair when one of our politicians was escorted out of a lufthansa flight by security , because he did not complied to the flight attendant 's request to put his coat into a luggage compartment rather than leaving it on an empty seat . 
  he basicly cries for help saying `` heeeeelp !, 
  germans , germans are assaulting me ! '' . 
  the other polish voices you hear are stating the obvious , which is basicly a verbal equivalent of a facepalm . 
   firstly , i never said what you try to imply i did . 
  secondly , i will not waste my time writing an essay here , so just two sentences . 
  yeah dude , sorry for that . 
  it is indeed my problem that you are so eloquent to state your opinion on such a complex topic in a tweet-like format and geezers like me need some full sentences and few numbers on top . 
  i salute you , indeed you are the future of europe !, 
   i 'd rather be average european country with national sovereignty than being dependent on another country and not being able to speak for yourself . 
  again , my mistake . 
  for intellectuals like you i should put tl ; dr at the end of my post so that you could understand that all i argued , is that for small to medium countries like ours this sovereignty you talk about is just a nice concept , that is ultimately meaningless without strong partners willing to respect it . 
  this is something you should get from history classes btw . 
   thus , for me and many others it 's better to sacrifice few years of prosperity for not being overran by islam in 20 years . 
  be my guest , sacrifice few years , while rest of us wonder how to deal with the fact that population of africa will double in the next 35 years ( while east europen is in sharp decline ) . 
  so what tweet-like solutions you have ? 
  some concentration camps here and there ? 
  few strategically applied nukes ? 
  please , enlighten me , i really need it . 
  funny , because how i see this , the joke is on countries like poland , hungary or czech republic . 
  take my country for example . 
  nearly a quarter of our exports goes to germany ( next in line is uk with nearly 7 % , then france with 6 % ... when you add up all western europe economies that 's about 50 % ) , compared to 3,2 % of german exports going to poland [ source ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/ ) . 
  we are the biggest beneficiaries of eu grants ( germany is the biggest net contributor to eu budget , surely they would n't mind some savings there ... ) . 
  and last , but certainly not least , we made economic migration inside eu a national sport . 
  we are # 1 in uk and norway , # 2 in ireland and germany , # 3 in sweden . 
  just between those countries , that 's well above 1,5 mil polish citizens enjoying freedom of labour market inside eu . 
  so when you say it 's western europe countries , that need us more than we depend on them , i seriously wonder in what reality do you live ? 
  let 's assume a scenario , which i understand you favour , that germany , france , uk , netherlands , spain , italy , scandinavia and who not - takes the burden of migration . 
  and , allah forbid , their economies collapse in the process . 
  do you seriously believe we wo n't feel any repercussions of such a scenario ? 
  that in the tightly interconnected global economy , it is us who will rise as new economic powerhouses ? 
  are you for real ? 
  do you seriously believe that it is us who are in the position of power here ? 
  wtf ?!, 
  the level of ignorance and total lack of of self-awareness in discussion around migration in our countries is simply frightening . 
  we literally bring upon ourselves every possible argument to diminish our position in the eu . 
  few articles in faz about how polish news outlets block comments under articles about immigration to save themselves the problem of notifying prosecutors about hate speech , few more from bild digging out fb comments from idiots who encourage reintroduction of gas chambers to deal with immigrants and every german politician ever is free to score political points on fucking us over . 
  but no , we have allies here - nigel farage in uk , marie le pen in france , sweeden democrats , pegida in germany - oh boy , those guys will surely stand united on our side ... briliant fucken strategy . 
  problem of migration is here to stay . 
  fuckups in middle east wo n't solve themselves anytime soon . 
  demographic bomb in africa is a fact . 
  economic and , you will love this , climat problems , will only `` heat it up '' ( sorry for a pun ) . 
  so either we in europe find a unified approach to deal with it , or everyone is for himself . 
  and guess what , i 'm convinced we here in eastern europe are on the loosing side in this scenario . 
  ultimately , we all will go into shitters , but we here are first in the line . 
  not the other way around . 
   but seriously , all that free welfare i think creates an entitlement mentality . 
  you think so , or you know so ? 
  because economical impact on migration has been studied extensively over the years , and shows very little ( if any ) [ impact on performence of a economy in a macro scale ] ( http://www.oecd.org/migration/mig/oecd%20migration%20policy%20debates%20numero%202.pdf ), 
  ... in uk/irland ? 
  i like the one about how poland is a western/central europe country / s, 
   ~ ~ 6 ~ ~ 5 countries have it as an official language . 
  ftfy . 
  swiss german can not possibly be a language . 
  it 's like klingon - some claim they can speak it , some even pretend they do , but you ca n't ever be sure if they are for real or just fucking with you . 
   i wonder , how poles live with these letters every day . 
  duh , embrace the `` z '' ... \u0449 in polish is `` szcz '' , so \u0449\u0438 is szczi . 
  easy . 
  nope , boiled ( young ) potatoes and [ soured milk ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/soured_milk ) are a common summer dish in poland, 
  my favorite is `` na pe\u0142nej kurwie '' , which can be roughly translated to `` with a full-on-kurwa '', 
  u what m8 ? 
  some context for you pleb / jk there is a common misconception that word `` kurwa '' has something to do with the latin word `` curvus '' meaning ... yup , you guessed it `` a curve '' . 
  wrong . 
  it 's actually as slavic as it gets . 
  it comes from the proto-slavic word `` kur '' which means `` a cock '' ( like a rooster pervs ) adding '' - a '' at the end makes it feminine , so `` kura '' means literally `` a hen '' . 
  so how you get a modern `` kurwa '' ( a prostitute , a slut - a dissolute woman in general ) from a word that literally means a hen ? 
  fair question !, 
  there are two theories . 
  1 . it is a borrowing from french . 
  indeed , the word `` cocotte '' in french has exactly the same two meanings - a hen or a prostitute . 
  but it seems it is not the case here , as there is already a word `` kokota '' in polish , which is a ( dated ) term for a prostitute . 
  plus , the usage of `` kurwa '' itself is much older than most borrowings from french in polish language . 
  2 . much more probable is that `` kura '' was initially used to call an unmarried woman . 
  and thus , through grammatical magic , `` kurew '' became a word meaning a son of an unmarried woman aka . 
  a bastard , hence offensive meaning . 
  which then morphed into `` kurwa '' as we know it today . 
  so how old is the word `` kurwa '' ? 
  there are records of court cases from as early as 1415 that mention explicitly word `` kurwa '' as a reason for a brawl . 
  in fact some medieval polish codexes banned the usage of the word itself  `` gdyby ma\u0107 jego kurw\u0105 mianowa\u0142 , w tak\u0105\u017c win\u0119 skazujemy ji by\u0107 upad\u0142ym '' . 
  * if one names ( someone 's ) mother a `` kurwa '' , he is guilty of profanity * furthermore phrase  `` kurwie macierze syn '' ( literally `` son of a unmarried women '' or simply put `` son of a bitch '' ) can be traced back to as far as 1396 court records . 
  at this point it 's worth noting that the usage of just the word `` kurwa '' , without following it with `` ma\u0107 / macierz '' meaning `` mother '' , is a relatively modern invention . 
  now to give you some perspective . 
  the first recorded usage of the word `` fuck '' in english can be tracked back to 1528 , when some monk scribbled on a margin `` fuckin abbot '' ( those bosses he ? ), 
  but all etymology aside .
