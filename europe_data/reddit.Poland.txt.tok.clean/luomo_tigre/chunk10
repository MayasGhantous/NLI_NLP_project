  having read several of his books and even discussing one of them ( `` fear '' ) over a whole semester while getting my history degree i must say that he is n't a bad historian . 
  data he uses is well researched and sources solid . 
  he is a professor of history at princeton , it 's safe to assume he knows a thing or two about his craft . 
   problem is that after meticulously presenting all that data he tends to jump to conclusions that often border on outlandish . 
  i live in berlin nowadays and every time i talk with my grandma she finishes the conversation with `` look out for those germans '' or something for this effect . 
  is it outlandish and borderline ridiculous ? 
  sure it is . 
  is it understandable given her experience ? 
  of course . 
  now gross is a holocaust survivor and was expelled from poland in '68 based on his ethnicity - it 's safe to assume there may be a hidden agenda in his works . 
  but as you surely know , for better or worse , history is written by people . 
  his personal experiences may cloud his judgments , but the facts he is referring to are well documented and thoroughly researched . 
   it 's hard to tell what his problem is . 
  if he 's just publicity-hungry or there is lower customary threshold of claims in us , but regardless i 'd suggest taking his grand claims with a grain of salt . 
  [ there are some easy points to be made on this whole holocaust thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaweiv944qi ) , no doubt about it . 
  but mind you , up until 2010 and jedwabne 's case , the whole topic of complicity of poles in holocaust was virtually nonexistent in our national consciousness . 
  so yeah , maybe he made some sweeping exaggerations in the process , but i would argue that the outcome was well worth it . 
  so let 's go back to the elephant in the room . 
  holocaust for the large part took place in poland , there 's no way around it . 
  all death camps ( vernichtungslager ) were placed in occupied poland . 
  around the half of all jews killed in the process were polish . 
  we , as a nation , were the biggest witnesses to this tragedy . 
  most certainly , we did not brought it on ourselves , but in a broad sense we were participating in it . 
  the history of holocaust is the history of poland . 
  many responded to it with unprecedented heroism - as illustrated by much loved yad vashem trees . 
  but is it so hard to acknowledge that ** many did not ** ? 
  the gaussian curve works in an unrelenting way . 
  3 millions of polish jews did not vanished without a substantial help of their neighbours . 
  we need to snap out of this feel-good narration and face the facts . 
  and boy those facts are hard to come around . 
  rest assured that not many documented their `` casual acts of kindness '' towards fellow jewish citizens . 
  there were no authorities keeping the track . 
  nonetheless evidence is there . 
  take for example gestapo archives from warsaw , where ipn found 255 letters just from 1940-41 from `` worried citizens '' reporting about conspicuous behaviour of their neighbours ( book is called `` szanowny panie gestapo '' / `` sincere mister gestapo '' ) . 
  even more so , read the [ 3 parts monograph ] ( http://www.matras.pl/zarys-krajobrazu-jest-taki-piekny-sloneczny-dzien-judenjagd-komplet,p,155593 ) about the jews hiding on polish countryside and try not to hit yourself repetivly in the groin just to get some relief . 
  and this is just the tip of the iceberg , because throughout the communist times , up until now there was no serious effort to analyze this part of our history . 
  one more thing that somehow feels missing about this thread . 
  no one seems to mention that striping gross from state honors , which were granted for his involvement in anti-communist opposition back in 68 , is just filthy . 
  and this was initiated by our beloved presided who most certainly was `` fighting '' the communist regime by heroically shitting his diapers 4 years later . 
  i feel dirty and ashamed just reading about this bullshit . 
   once again - i 'm not at expert on the period nor i know enough of subject at hand to discuss this source , but what you say about quality of the sources in general is exactly what i was talking about that he makes grand claims based on flimsy evidence or insufficient amount of it . 
  if you 're interested in the topic i suggest to look for works of [ centrum bada\u0144 nad zag\u0142ad\u0105 \u017byd\u00f3w ] ( http://www.holocaustresearch.pl/ ) ( part of pan ) . 
  i agree that conclusions by prof. 
  gross are highly speculative and need to be treated with a grain of salt ( to say the least ) , but it 's not that he is the only one researching this topic . 
  and almost 60 % of cars in poland were produced by german companies . 
  not to mention that 100 % of posts in this thread are in english which is a west germanic language . 
  now knowing that yiddish is judeo-germanic ... 
   okey , i just assume you have qualifications to issue this firm judgement . 
  [ `` escape '' on polonia 1 with knapik voiceover ] ( https://youtu.be/aw47-gkvzge ) shout out to all polish redditors growing up in the 90s - there are dozen of us !, 
  i salute your fortitude and overall good will , but surely you could mix in some absurd bs into your translation . 
  imagine some good willed westerners taking this for real ... we can do better than that !, 
  we have religious nutters after all !, 
  duh , you clearly forgot about \u0105 , \u0119 , \u0107 , \u017a and \u0142 ... 
  i would argue that katowice/katowicy/katovice / kattowitz , and silesia / \u015al\u016fnsk / schlesien / \u0160leska / \u015al\u0105sk / slezsko in general , is one of the most interesting parts of europe when it comes to cultural and historical diversity . 
  it 's also a pretty dope city . 
  and if you look for a nice excuse to visit it , i see at least [ two ] ( http://festiwalnowamuzyka.pl/en/ ) [ good ] ( http://off-festival.pl/en ) reasons . 
  as a pole , i 'm happy you guys are finally ready to talk openly about your dick size . 
  in 1980 k. kie\u015blowski made one of the most important documentaries in the history of cinema - [ talking heads ] ( https://youtu.be/66cbsfuyxtu ) - by simply asking poles three questions : 1 . 
  when were you born ? 
  1 . who are you ? 
  what is important for you ? 
  what would be your answers ? 
   alpine serbs how about alpine slavs so all of us squatting folk can jump onto the bandwagon ? 
  polish speaker here . 
  first things first , the idea that portuguese sounds anything like polish is a rather peculiar thought . 
  nice one !, 
  that being said , there may be some logic here . 
  polish language has a fixed accent system meaning that , when speaking , you almost always put stress on a next-to-last syllable . 
  this makes it sound more rigid ( and makes it more challenging to write lyrics , poetry or rapping - there 's just much less combinations of words that rhyme ) . 
  russian on the other hand has a fluid stress , which makes it sound much more melodic . 
  we even refer to eastern polish accents as `` singing '' . 
  her 90s albums ( debut + post + homogenic ) are definitely considered canonical . 
  hard to imagine modern pop music without them . 
  source : i 've been writing about music ( semi - ) professionally back in the day . 
   oh ok so its gone silent because the tide has slowed for now then ? 
   what is this `` tide '' you are talking about ? 
  how many immigrants make a `` tide '' - 100 , 500 , 10 000 , 1 000 000 ? 
  what number makes you horny ? 
  does black immigrants count equally as muslim ones ? 
  what about black muslims , do you count them at all ? 
  dude , there were people dying in hundreds trying to cross mediterranean , before you decided to introduce freedom and democracy to middle east . 
  but yeah , thx for the new `` tides '' - those miserable fucks in developing countries basically needed a gentle push of reducing their homes to rubble , to finally realize their true potential as rapists somewhere in eastern europe . 
   what about the attack in france on the police officers i heard it was a `` commando type gang '' what does that mean ? 
  i heard it was in a muslim area was the gang muslims ? 
  700 million people in europe . 
  yes , we all heard the news about a `` muslim rape commando '' causing havoc somewhere in france . 
  we are all terrified . 
  it 's basically like warzone here , or chicago ... 
  so called `` middle east '' mostly because i have no fucking clue about it ... 1 . 
  beirut , even for a weekend . 
  it 's so easy and affordable , that it just makes me sad i have n't done it yet . 
  damascus , sadly not any time soon ... but the history there !, 
  the tigris-euphrates region in iraq , because how many `` cradles of civilisation '' are there ? 
  iran , before it becomes overrun by tourists 5 . 
  samarkand , uzbekistan - for a few hundred years , somewhere between classical era and renaissance muslim scholars , philosophers and thinkers were keeping the flame of reason alive for the rest of us . 
  this was the epicenter . 
  living in berlin , but originally from warsaw . 
  few observations : 1 . 
  sadly , you still meet people believing that warsaw is somewhat close to a polar circle - polar bears included . 
  it 's a well known `` eastern european bias '' .
