  there is something in the sound of this word , that makes it an ultimate curse word . 
  imagine u step on a lego , or after 3h of debugging u find this shitty bs mistake ... you can say `` fuck '' as loud as you can , but it will still lack the weight , the gravitas of a solid [ kurrrwa ma\u0106 ] ( https://youtu.be/cjkt2xhtroa ), 
  these brits they 're coming here , they 're stealing ~ ~ our jobs ~ ~, 
  that depends on your age and social situation ( married , children ? 
  commitments like this makes a decision to relocate infinitely more difficult ) . 
  if you are a young girl/dude fresh out of studies/still studying i say go for it . 
  you risk literally nothing , and the gains will overshadow any potential downsides . 
  1 . language barrier ? 
  you will learn the language in no time , being surrounded by native speakers is by far the single most easiest way to perfect a foreign language . 
  in fact , if english is your mother tongue in most european countries you will be frustrated , by people who instantly switch to it , the moment they hear your accent . 
  2 . living abroad is the single best lesson in independence out there . 
  no shortcuts for you , no friends/family to rely on . 
  sure , it is scary at first , but you will quickly realise that most people around you are eager to help . 
  work colleagues , follow expats that you would never even talk to , if met at home , or even a kiosk salesman that does not understand a word you say . 
  most of them will help you , because why the fuck not ? 
  you would do the same if they were in your place . 
  3 . living abroad gives you a totally new perspective on your homeland . 
  you start to appreciate things you took for granted and notice the fuck ups that you never realised . 
  and just for that , to be a better citizen of your own country it is worth it . 
  just for the things you will learn about yourself and your nation . 
  totally worth it . 
  i beg to differ , the sole purpose of a research institute funded by taxpayers ' money is , you know , to do research . 
  justified or not , moving the graves of communist apparatchiks is hardly a scientific endeavour . 
   tho at least in poland it 's a history institute , over here the issue only comes up when there 's political points to be won . 
  sadly the institute of national remembrance is known for having a political bias ( or even agenda ) . 
  that is why news like this are not necessarily what you think they are . 
  born and raised in warsaw , berliner by choice . 
  berlin is much more chill , especially now in the summer . 
  warsaw , though smaller in size , has a much more `` big city '' feel . 
   explore both cities have much to offer historically/culturally wise . 
  trying not to be biased , but if you have n't been yet to the slavic part of europe , then maybe warsaw . 
  if you are interested in the modern history of europe aka . 
  communism/cold war , then probably berlin . 
  but yeah , a draw here . 
   dance to trance music u mad ? 
  berlin . 
  no question about it . 
   relax would say berlin , but warsaw by the riverside right now is also pretty sweet  speak to pretty ladies warsaw . 
  if someone will try to convince you otherwise , just smile politely and count in your head all the slavic supermodels you know, 
   it devoured more than 300.000 citizens of warsaw sorry , but this number you quote is simply `` out of your ass '' . 
  obviously there is no definite figure , but most of historians estimate the number of casualties around 150-200 thousand . 
  there is no need for a dick measuring contest here . 
  even the moderate estimates compared to , for example , the number of us casualties in the course of the whole wwii - around 450.000 people - are simply staggering . 
  needles to say that in the first day of the uprising estimated number of casualties is comparable to the allied losses on the d-day landing in normandy . 
  and one more fact that is often forgotten . 
  of the 150-200 thousand dead in the wu only 20.000 were the insurgents , rest were civilians living in warsaw at the time . 
   edit it 's also really , really important to remember that red army ( the russian army + satellites ) has completely let warsaw down during that time . 
  they just waited to bleed us out , preventing western help to the city . 
  this way they had it easier to conquer ( yes , not liberate ) warsaw after germans left . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm last to defend soviets on this one , but before we blame everything on the casual suspects - it is also ** really , really important ** for every polish person to know that : 1 . the leadership of the home army , when making the decision about the uprising , must have known about the outcome of the similar insurgencies in vilnius , lviv and volhynia where polish freedom fighters were either ignored by the red army or merely tolerated , just to be disarmed and arrested ( or shot at sight by nkvd ) after fighting ceased . 
  2 . beyond any doubt the ha decidents knew about the political outcome of teheran and yalta conferences , and the fact that western allies will be less than eager to support polish independence . 
  which bring us to the last point . 
  3 . we also know about the mindset of ha leadership in the eve of the uprising . 
  in march of 1944 chief commander of ha gen. `` b\u00f3r '' komorowski decided against the uprising in warsaw . 
  he was only convinced by the hawkish wing of the polish resistance ( gen. okulicki and gen. pe\u0142czy\u0144ski ) to start it as a some kind of wake up call for the west to support the polish cause . 
  tragically , they had little clue about how western public opinion viewed what is happening in poland . 
  in short , no one gave a flying fuck about it , as long as soviets took majority of the weight of fighting the nazi germany . 
  and this fatal detachment from reality is , quite frankly the only argument in favour of the decision , that ultimately lead to the destruction of my home city and death of hundred of thousands of people . 
  i do respect your opinion and maybe even agree with it to some extend . 
  but let me tell you about a monument of so called [ `` little insurgent '' ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ma%c5%82y_powstaniec ) in warsaw . 
  it depicts a child bearing a machine gun and wearing a german helmet . 
  there are two peculiar facts about it . 
  first , both the gun and the helmet are deliberately out of scale , presumably to achieve some kind of twisted `` artistic vision '' intended by the sculptor . 
  and secondly , most of the children taking part in the uprising were not actively fighting ( in fact there were not enough arms for `` grown ups '' , not to mention children ) . 
  most of the children were used as spotters or to pass information between troops . 
  which mind you , does not mean i am justifying their involvement !, 
  quite the contrary , it just shows how fucked up our vision of the uprising is . 
  we literally do n't mind to vitimize children as some kind of feel-good excuse for our national pride ( or whatever this sick cult of the uprising is ) . 
   of course it was doomed from the start and ultimately a disaster for the people of warsaw , but then , could n't the same be said for the revolt at auschwitz-birkenau ? 
  besides , to blame the destruction of the city and her inhabitants on the home army seems to be an atrocious form of ` victim-blaming ' . 
  the poles had spent half a decade under the ferocious tyranny of nazism , and were coming to the awful realisation that the western allies were only going to betray them to stalinism . 
  it 's easy to look back on it as senseless , but in that sad time there were poles who insisted on asserting their independence at any cost , and i think that 's worth feeling pride for , even if it did fail - like the ko\u015bciuszko uprising . 
  sorry , but as a person born and raised in warsaw , wola district , i find this kind of argument mute . 
  comparing warsaw uprising with revolt at the auschwitz or even warsaw ghetto uprising is simply misleading . 
  there is a huge difference between having nothing to loose and making a political statement at the expense of thousands of civilian lives and destruction of the biggest city in poland . 
  because guess what , we do have insight into why leadership of the home army made the decision for uprising . 
  and it was most certainly not motivated by any strategic rationale . 
  it was a glorified pr stunt to `` shake the consciousness of the world '' ( direct quote from gen. okulicki ) . 
  so i do n't know about `` victim-blaming '' , but as far as ha leadership is concerned , it was purely a political gamble , and an utterly delusional one too . 
  i see no reason why we should refrain from judging it as such . 
  oh , and one more thing . 
  you say that : `` there were poles who insisted on asserting their independence at any cost '' . 
  sure thing , but please do n't forget that the ** vast majority of casualties ** in the uprising were civilians . 
  for every freedom fighter that willingly sacrificed her or his life there were literally hundreds of people who lost their lives as mere bystanders to this mayhem . 
  miron bia\u0142oszewski , warsaw poet , wrote a memoir about his time during uprising from a perspective of a civilian . 
  you will be hard pressed to find there any mention of this poetic heroism you seem so eager to praise . 
  and you know what is truly shocking ? 
  that up until today there is no monument to the civilian casualties of the uprising in warsaw . 
  not a single one . 
  each and every squad of home army fighting in the uprising has a street , square or a school named after . 
  but thousands upon thousands who died in silence are simply being forgotten . 
  so if you are saying i should be proud about warsaw uprising it saddens me deeply , because it just shows how little we learned out of it . 
  i watch all the festivities that accompany the anniversary of warsaw uprising today and i 'm speechless . 
  we literally celebrate death and destruction and for what ? 
  for an idea of poland , not for what this idea should stand for - polish people and their wellbeing . 
  there is a point where self-preservation turns into self-destruction and for me this is what happened in warsaw 70 years ago . 
  so if you ask me what i feel today it 's certainly not pride , if anything it is anger and despair for a nation who just refuses to learn from it 's mistakes . 
  edit : i feel deeply ashamed to say it , as a member of a family that lost its members in auschwitz , but there was hardly a revolt at auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . 
  i quickly checked it with my father , and yes there was a relatively small outbreak in [ october of 1944 ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/holocaust/aurevolt.html ) that was quickly suppresed by the ss guards . 
  what you are referring to is most probably the [ sobib\u00f3r camp revolt ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/sobib%c3%b3r_extermination_camp ) and the [ treblinka camp revolt ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/treblinka_extermination_camp ) which were much larger in scale , and resulted in some prisoners escaping .
