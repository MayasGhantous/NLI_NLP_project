  the bottomline here is to remember that auschwitz , even in german nomenclature ( konzentrationslager vs. vernichtungslager ) , was not a death camp as such ( as twisted as it sounds ) . 
  some of the prisoners were used as forced labourers in the nearby chemical plant . 
  the real `` extermination camps '' , built with the sole purpose of removing the jewish population , were placed in sobib\u00f3r , treblinka , be\u0142\u017cec and che\u0142mno . 
  and you wo n't find much there . 
  no remnants of big encampment , no barbed wire fences - just a serene clearing in the middle of the woods and lots of questions . 
  dude , when maria sk\u0142odowska curie names a fucken element polonium and chopin composes polonaises it kinda gives a hint . 
  which part of `` making sure you actually see shit '' in order to drive a car is * harsh * ? 
  i really hope i missed some kind of cultural reference , dank meme or whatever in your comment . 
  i really do n't want to sound as a patronising eurosnob , but how the hell did you mange to find a connection between a prime example of muscovite architecture ( 17th century russia ) and a pretty frivolous ( and , at least to a trained eye , obviously artificial ) variation about various architectural styles from late 19th/early 20th century ? 
  now i 'm an architecture baff , so maybe my aggravation is foolish and out of proportion ... but dude , u for real ? 
  as a proud pole yet to visit uk ( will probably show up when we finally annex it ) i must say `` bollocks '' is my lightweight curse word of choice . 
  there is a certain gravitas to it , yet somehow balanced out by an utterly frivolous spirit of this word . 
  i simply can not imagine a pub brawl started soleli on the premise that someone used this word in an offensive manner . 
  it 's actually a grim heritage of eastern/central europe as a whole . 
  serfdom ruled supreme in our parts of the continent well till mid 19th century . 
  even longer in russia ( and thus part of poland under russian rule ) . 
  it had a massive influence on our history , language - hell , even cousine - but , funnily enough , not nearly as great on our culture . 
  our culture , as we know it today , was created and cultivated by serfdom beneficiaries - the nobles . 
  so no wonder . 
  for example when every pole learns in school by heart lines from early 19th century national epic `` pan tadeusz '' , she or he hardly realizes that idyllic descriptions of polish countryside ( well lithuanian actually ... ) at that time were idyllic for no more than 8-10 % of polish society ( and mind you the number of nobility in commonwealth was huge , compared to 1 % in france and 3 % in great britain ) . 
  rest of our ancestors were in a position comparable to black slaves in us . 
  this is not much of an exaggeration . 
  true , serfs were not officially owned by the landowner ( so there were not a tradable commodity ) and depending on the period and region , had some minimal personal rights , but still : * they were bonded to the land owned by the nobel - so no freedom of movement * were obliged to work the owner 's land for up to 6 days a week * were outside of the juridical system , meaning if a nobel fancied to punish or even kill a serf - well , bummer for the serf . 
  in commonwealth serfs were put under common law by the constitution of 3rd may . 
  and as much as we poles like to praise our `` second constitution in the world , first in europe '' , it most definitely did not abolish serfdom . 
  ironically , the little rights given to serfs and ( reasonably more ) to city freemen , were a major reason for a big part of nobility to team up with russia and in aftermath disband poland as a country for 200 years . 
  one could argue that serfdom was effectively abolished in poland as late as 1944 , by - yes , you guessed it - those pesky commies and their land reform . 
  why ? 
  because even though serfdom was abolished in mid 19th century , giving civil rights to peasants did not change their position . 
  land they were living off , was still owned by nobles . 
  feudal servitude was nearly replaced with an economical dependence . 
  and even today , when you read our history textbooks , you get a somehow twisted view . 
  for example the only peasant uprising that polish school children can learn about ( and shit there were literally hundreds of them - avid europa universalis iv players can attest ) is the so called [ galician slaughter of 1846 ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/galician_slaughter ) . 
  and as the name suggest , depiction of it is dominated by vivid descriptions of atrocities committed on polish gentry , quickly followed by a constatation how austro-hungarian partitioner used it to stifle national tendencies among polish nobility . 
  ** no : ** our economy was ruined by foreign debt we acquired throughout 70s due to so called `` gierek prosperity '' period . 
  which in a hindsight is a textbook example of shortcomings of a central planned economy . 
  ** and no : ** calling the introduction of a martial law in poland in 81 and consequent jaruzelski 's leadership throughout the whole decade as a `` military junta '' shows either : - a basic misunderstanding of what a military dictatorship is - a basic ignorance regarding history of your country - a healthy mix of both , most likely intended to be an an edgy remark showing your contempt for our communist past . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck about your view on communist period , but at least you could restrain yourself from twisting the facts . 
  that would be much appreciated . 
  edit : ok , that was probably too harsh . 
  i do respect your views on our communist past . 
  feel free to judge it as you wish . 
  but please , do not use some out of place generalisations and mental shortcuts to get your point across . 
  all i wanted to say is that regardless of your opinions on our history : 1 . 
  80 's economic collapse in poland was at large an effect of gierek 's policies in the 70s 2 . 
  martial law in poland and it 's afterfall as a historical process has very little , if nothing , to do with military dictatorship south america style , or even what happened in our country after may coup in 1926 , which is what is commonly refereed to as a `` military junta '' . 
   but otherwise , greeks are living in another world , if they do not believe they have to fundamentally change , in or out of the eurozone , with or without debt , without or without funding ... 
  i enjoyed your points , especially when it comes to sources and numbers . 
  but for the sake of the argument , let 's assume you are 100 % right . 
  so what you are trying to say is that we have this driving licence that , as it turns out , can be acquired even by a blind person . 
  and we only found out about it , when this blind person caused a serious accident . 
  question here is what does it really says about the quality of given driving licence in the first place ? 
  * ( hint : replace `` driving licence '' with `` ez '' and `` blind person '' with greece ) *, 
  spoiler alert we are all fucked . 
  john snow dies . 
  everyone chill the fuck down . 
  it 's clear that greece can not afford ms office anymore and switched to openoffice . 
  add to equation an unpaid intern on the receiving end and voila - a classic example of `` wtf ?!, 
  why no pdf ? '', 
  my suggestion would be to use google docs . 
  this way greek side could edit bailout terms in the real-time . 
  source : i am a mickey mouse club fellow with a ph.d. in visual basic macros for ms office . 
   bookies william hill have cut their odds on a no vote in the greek referendum from 2/1 to 5/4 , and lengthened the odds for a yes vote from 4/11 to 4/7 . 
  ` all the serious money so far has been for a ` no ' vote ' said hill 's spokesman graham sharpe . 
  holly shit , i may have found a solution for greek clusterfuck right here . 
  let them bet all 1.6 bln instalment against the odds and vote `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  bam problem solved !, 
  * 10 % for this idea *, 
  ok dude , but this is like three now/then pictures plus a pretty obvious ad for a tech startup . 
  i 'm all up for a smart growth hacking , but this is just lazy . 
  smarter strategy would be to write an article about scale of remittance in eu/globally backed by some nice data . 
  with a catchy headline like ` people transfer yearly x euromonez between eu countries shocka ' you could reach far more of your potential user base . 
  would also be cool if your nifty widget showed some conversion rates . 
  i mean i do n't have a currency converter in my eyes and your cool claims are surely true , but yet some more in depth comparison with avg . 
  bank spread/fees would make me more confident in your service . 
  and finally , you concentrate on remittance only or are taking into account people who have credits in foreign currency too ? 
  this excuse does not work if you live in germany . 
  deutsche post never fails . 
  i mean literally . 
  they had a strike few days back and dhl was still delivering amazon prime packages . 
  there was definitely some grilling at `` dzia\u0142ka '' , but i live 600km away so i 'm excused . 
  nonetheless should have fucken called . 
  fuck my moms name day was on sunday ... thanks pal now i 'm a shitty son !, 
  update : called home . 
  got some minor scolding , but apparently i 'm still in the will . 
  day was saved by my older brother who not only managed to show up late and turbo hangovered , but also forgot to pick up his wife from work on the way to the `` dzia\u0142ka '' ( it 's an allotment in polish , if anyone wondered ) . 
  i owe you one bro , u da real mvp < 3 . 
  i feel like most of this rules either do not apply to berlin or are rather laxed here . 
  i mean once i had police officers throwing snowballs at my window so i turn down the music - so either this or i mixed it up with your good ol' german efficiency . 
  basicly all soups that are served cold are called `` ch\u0142odnik '' in polish and are typically summer dishes . 
  btw . 
  kefir/butter milk are modern substitutes for [ soured milk ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/soured_milk ) which is a traditional base for this soup . 
  and no , soured milk is not the same as spoiled milk . 
  if i would have to go for one traditional polish summer dish my choice would be cold soured milk with some young potatoes and [ mizeria ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/mizeria ) salad, 
  shhh there are some americans here . 
  they still do n't know that croatia is the secret go to holliday destination for us europeans . 
  pls do n't spoil it / s, 
  i do understand ukrainians who write whatever they wish on the shells they use to ** kill people ** . 
  their country was attacked , clearly political correctness is the last thing they worry about right now . 
  emotions is what takes over them now .
