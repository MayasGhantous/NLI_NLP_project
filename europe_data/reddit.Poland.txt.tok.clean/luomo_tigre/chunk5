  disagree . 
  when it comes to ip ( intellectual property ) there are totaly different factors at play . 
  it all goes down to the mix of two things - purchasing power and accessibility . 
  in socialist times it was easy , all domestic culture production , be it movies , music or art , was state owned . 
  so the prices were fixed . 
  they were dirty cheap in fact ( culture = = propaganda . 
  well kinda , because actually most of the post-stalinist culture in poland was surprisingly non-battleship-potemkin like . 
  anyway different story ) . 
  when it comes to foreign ip - there was simply no `` copyright protection '' in the western sense of the term . 
  i mean why should it be ? 
  quick example , my father in a physics department of military university in 60s poland was working on `` odra '' computers , which in fact were state-of-art 1-to-1 copies of moder ibm mainframes . 
  so what , ibm lawyers would come to communist poland suing for liability ? 
  yeah , the fuck they would . 
  same for the beatles lawyers and so on . 
  but this worked as long as you were beatles or ibm . 
  if you were for example american rock group love , who released one of my favorite 60s album `` forever changes '' - which was not a big hit at the time - chances that you could listen to it in poland in 1967 were next to none . 
  this is where accessibility problems kick in . 
  iron culture was blocking shit-loads of stuff , and - surprise surprise - in large part not because of censorship ( north korea isolation would still be bat-shit crazy in communist poland ) , but mostly because of the information and cultural blockage . 
  fast forward to the early 90s in poland . 
  nirvana is the biggest thing ever . 
  i get my first album - guns ` nroses `` best of '' for my shitty allowance - no problem . 
  but ... all this is technically illegal , as there is still no notion of western `` copy rights '' . 
  major labels kick in in the late 90s . 
  they stand before a decision - we make our stuff affordable for pols for 1/6 of what it costs in germoney , but than germans can come and buy it for the same price . 
  or we align prices of records to the western standards ... guess what decision they made . 
  in the mean time , domestic culture production is in shambles , as there is no state money anymore , and capitalist ways in culture production turns out to be a totally different beast . 
  in short , all goes to shit , pirate industry is thriving . 
  also , when you do n't have money for your current needs , culture is the first thing you cut . 
  maslow and stuff . 
  now our purchasing power is roughly 70 % of the eu average , but we are still accustomed that one does not pay for culture . 
  what is more , accessibility for amazing bbc documentary in poland is ... well there is none . 
  itunes library compared to us or even uk one is a joke ( and adjusted to polish wages it simply does not make sense ) . 
  but spotify , for example , is half the price as in germany ( where i happen to live ) . 
  and thanks to gema spotify 's library in poland is even bigger . 
  and guess what , people are paying for this service relatively in the same numbers , as they do here in germany . 
  yeah , and i bet germany gets all the good tiles ... such is life, 
  politechniki ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/search/pl+politechniki/@52.220169,21.012302,3a,75y,262.31h,63.83t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1ssqttftnq_rennxvs3j9mxq!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) , been there done that . 
  not proud of it , but when you are late for classes u do what you have to do . 
  i 'm also pretty sure i saw a genius or two who parked on the jerozolimskie/cha \u0142bi\u0144skiego roundabout . 
  parking in warsaw - the struggle is real, 
  almost as deadly as kinder egg, 
  on a more serious note , there were around 800 000 women serving in the red army during wwii , including [ most deadliest female sniper in history ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lyudmila_pavlichenko ) , and wordl 's only two [ feamle fighter aces ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lydia_litvyak ) . 
  i found almost total absence of women on the parade deeply unsettling . 
  have you ever been to , i do n't know ... warsaw ? 
   american-sounding names like eg . 
  axel , kevin , jessica , angelica etc  there is a special place in hell for people who not only choose ridiculous american-sounding names for their children , but also use polish spelling - seriously , and\u017celika ?!, 
  gtfo, 
  is n't it mostly an ossi thingy ? 
  what about other residents of uk that are ineligible to vote . 
  who would you vote for if you could ? 
  and why ? 
  it 's easy , catholic poland and bible belt want to go to heaven first so that we can have the best spots on the right hand of our lord and saviour ** jan pawel ii **, 
  greetings from the past !, 
  do you have flying cars ? 
  not to mention that this country is ireland , and it 's gdp growth is not what it used to be to put it mildly, 
  all cool , but empirical data in social studies are just that , empirical data in social studies . 
  not saying that they are useless , quite contrary , but by no means are `` ultimate proof '' of anything . 
  for example this study shows that in given period ( 1996-2007 , which , mind you , is before crisis ) in 27-eu states ( which rises some flags already , because i 'm pretty sure there were less than 27 eu states in 1996 . does eurostat collected this kind of data about non-eu states in this period ? ), 
  given the definition of `` large/medium/small public sector '' chosen by authors of this study - this happened . 
  then again , you can always count on our peaceful neighbours to stop by and mess up gene pool from time to time, 
  i would be cautious with applying this kind of strategies to slavic women . 
  notion of domestic violence against men is virtually nonexistent in our culture . 
  oh man , this reminds me of this one time back in the day , when police patrol caught us red handed having a couple of beers on a stadium near our high school ( we were 18 so it was all cool in this regard ) . 
  when they asked should n't we be at school at this time of the day , we spilled the beans that we are in fact skipping ** religion classes ** . 
  needles to say we made their day . 
  they had literally tears in their eyes while filing those tickets . 
  we were not amused . 
  as much as i agree with main point of your post , you are making it extremely hard to take you seriously . 
   no , nazis are national socialists , which are on the extreme left . 
  according to traditional left-right political spectrum nazis/fascists and their ilk are considered far-right . 
  if you want to express your political views in a manner understandable to a common person you need to deal with it . 
  otherwise add a disclaimer what you consider right/left far or center or whatever suits your beliefs  i am just an average patriotic guy - that 's center right so if you are moderate or god-forbid-almost-nazi leftist you can not be patriotic ? 
  what about gays , can gay people be patriotic ? 
  dude , please . 
   with extremely capitalist views on the economy - that makes me far right . 
  no , hardly . 
  from what i 'm guessing it makes you liberal or neoliberal or market-fundamentalist to be as extreme as it gets . 
  still hardly far-right . 
  in fact many liberals are also libertarian which usually place them around center of the spectrum . 
  and `` capitalist '' is a quite broad term . 
  can mean anything from state capitalism of china to strange mix of extreme free market economy with state owned monopolies like in singapore . 
   do n't call me a nazi , that is punishable where ? 
  on internet ? 
  on reddit ? 
  in poland ? 
  with all due respect ( and i mean it , i have nothing against you ) claims like this make you look ridiculous . 
  even in poland it is not punishable by law to call someone a nazi . 
  sure , you can file a civil lawsuit against / u/stuffmaster1000 for infringement of you personal rights , but that 's about it . 
  holocaust denial and popularizing of nazi ideology is criminalized in poland - calling someone a nazi on the internetz is most definitely not . 
   that 's like i would call all left wingers pol pots or stalinists . 
  i just need to believe you that you are nearly as outraged when someone calls a left leaning person a ` stalinist ' , as you are about all that nazi stuff . 
  somehow i 'm not convinced . 
   way more than enough aid money to demolish and rebuild every city in every country on the continent twice !, 
  seems like a well grounded argument , could you provide me with some sources ? 
  so we are europe when those sweet sweet yros flow to poland via eu , but we were never `` europe '' when discussing problems like immigration . 
  yup enough is enough !, 
  they should definitely thank us for nearly two hundred years of colonial exploitation . 
  they should also remember fondly how world bank and international monetary fund helped them in 70s leaving with enormous foreign debt ( thanks to policies de facto enforced on developing world by those two institutions , from 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20 % ) . 
  and thank us greatly how we subsequently tried to solve those problems in 80-90s by applying yet another set of policies known as `` washington consensus '' . 
  as a result , between 1980 and 2000 , per capita income in sub-saharan africa fell by 9 % .
