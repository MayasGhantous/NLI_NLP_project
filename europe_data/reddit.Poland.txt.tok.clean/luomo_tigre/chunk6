  not to mention that sub-saharan africa is believed to suffer the hardest hit by climate change . 
  so yeah africa , you 're welcome . 
  but get your shit together , k ? 
   if they get such low support , that simply means people do not want them . 
  welcome to democracy . 
  dunno , for me it is also a symptom of dysfunction in polish democracy . 
  i 'm well aware that polish society has a strong right wing bias , but still one would imagine that in nearly 40m country there should be a place for well defined left wing party ( and i 'm talking about main stream party , not kpp or maoists or god knows who else ) . 
  but i wo n't argue , as at this point it is virtually impossible to tell what are political leanings of any of our parties . 
  this is the biggest legacy of tusk/kaczynski tandem that they managed to eliminate any notion of politics from polish politics . 
  that is why there is simply no points to earn for komorowski to show up on a debate . 
   from far left to far right . 
  say what ? 
  there is no mainstream left wing party in poland , not to mention `` far left '' . 
  hell , left wing thinking is absent from any public debate since years now . 
  and pls do n't get me started on sld and mr. `` linear tax is the answer '' miller . 
  greens would probably qualify , but as usual they will get support on the level of statistical error . 
  the mindfuck , when you realise that polish national epic starts with : `` lithuania !, 
  my homeland ... '', 
  here you go , some facts about our `` green island '' economy . 
  ** competitiveness of our economy is build on one and solely one factor - low wages ** . 
  first , let it be 100 % clear , according to every statistical data at hand cost of labour in poland is one of the lowest in eu . 
  non-wages costs , are also way below eu average . 
  so pls go fuck yourself with standard `` zus is ass-raping polish people '' bullshit , k ? 
  second , our workforce productivity per hour is less than half of that in germany . 
  meaning that on average two poles generate the wealth that one german dude does . 
  does it mean that max mustermann is on average twice as smart and hardworking as jan kowalski ? 
  nope , it means that he is employed in company that is more advanced ( so his skills are worth more ) and is working with technology that helps him make shit faster and/or better . 
  in other words he is not employed in callcenter , amazon warehouse or is cleaning toilets , but rather designs bmw cars or produces wind turbines . 
  * wind turbines that we clearly despise because coal based economy is sooo much more prospective and makes us overshadow china ( i mean literally , as in smog clouds over katowice and krak\u00f3w ) . 
  but this is another story * . 
  but ok , lets not compare ourselves with germoney . 
  in all fairness our situation here is not much different compared to our regional counterparts like czech republic , hungary or baltics ( maybe apart from esti which in the long run , could into nordic ) . 
  so what we do to change this ? 
  ** we do next to nothing to change this ** . 
  r&d and education is the name of the game . 
  and we are failing at it big time . 
  where it comes to education it seems it 's not so bad . 
  in % of gdp we actually spend more then germany !, 
  well not really . 
  we have a whole fucken cottage industry of fake collages/universities that sell `` diplomas '' to future lidl cashiers ( this is hilarious but lidl actually offers higher/upper secondary education in germany , that is probably worth more than what is offered by any polish private `` university of almost higher education '' ) . 
  not everyone in germany is studying , many people choose upper secondary education that leaves them with solid skills on the job market , whereas polish education in this segment ( szko\u0142y zawodowe , technika ) slowly cease to exist . 
  in r&d shit starts to stink . 
  our r&d spending amounts to only 0.9 percent of gdp , placing poland at the tail end of eu rankings ( 2.09 % on average in eurozone , above 3 % in germoney ) . 
  again , in all fairness , we are not alone in this shithole . 
  it is roughly the same in czech republic and hungary . 
  but when you take a closer look at the structure of our expenditure , shit starts to get real . 
  first , only 1/3 of this spending is done by private sector ( that puts us in romanian levels , sorry romania dudes for being negative reference : < ) . 
  so the burden of innovation is put on the state . 
  second , even the structure of expenditure in private sector is batshit crazy . 
  nearly 90 % of it goes to investments into fixed assets , mainly machines and equipment , and just 8 % into real research and innovation . 
  ( compared to 59 % and 23 % respectively for ** central europe as a whole ** - it does not add up to 100 % because you can buy knowledge or pay third parties to research it for you , things we do n't do anyway ) . 
  so in the layman terms , sure your employer in poland wants you to be as productive as max mustermann via better equipment and technology lines , but still he would prefer that you work in callcenter , amazon workshop or clean toilets , because fuck it !, 
  ** brace yourself , second greece is coming ** . 
  this is where shit is getting out of hand . 
  i bring you the `` marvel '' of polish economy - employment structure !, 
  now this is one statistic that we clearly rule . 
  nearly 30 % of polish people are employed short-term ( number 1 in eu , fuck yeah ! ) . 
  but wait , there is more !, 
  add it to second statistic that 23 % ( 3 ml ) of people are self employed ( 15 % eu average ) , but somehow only 1/5 of them employ other people ... which means we have 2,25 ml freelancers !, 
  ( the number of bearded hipsters with macbooks in starbucks is epic ... lol no ) . 
  what this means is that poland at rapid rate is abandoning the welfare state model and replaces it with ... nothing . 
  to avoid taxation poles are moving ( or in may cases are forced to move ) to `` elastic '' employment , meaning less employment stability , less employment benefits , less tax income for the country . 
  lady that is cleaning your office is most likely self-employed entrepreneur . 
  so as a nurse in public hospital . 
  and so do you . 
  this is already fucking up our budget . 
  we may have low labour costs and corporate income taxes , but we sure do close up to the nordics when it comes to vat rates ( and the nature of vat taxation is that it 's burden is mostly beard by low to medium households ... but yeah , let us not forget how bad polish `` job creators '' have : < ) . 
  this form of employment also nullifies employees collective bargaining capabilities ( but we clearly do n't want trade unions , they are sooo communist . 
  our glorious employers will take care of us ) . 
  add to this one of the lowest birth rates in eu and in 20-30 years perspective you will have a whole generation of poles without a pension . 
  and before i hear arguments that `` well i do n't trust polish state to pay my pension , i will work for my own wellbeing '' there is one more fact i want you to consider ... low and medium skilled workplaces are most vulnerable to being shifted to other countries ( it 's easiest to replace unskilled workers than managers or engineers ) . 
  so in light of facts i mentioned , our whole economy makes sense on the assumption that we will never reach the level of the west . 
  furthermore , we should be the biggest supporters of mr. putin 's shitshow in ukraine , mr. lukashenko 's dictatorship in belarus and whoever is currently embezzling state funds in romania and bulgaria , because the moment those countries get their shit together our workplaces will evaporate overnight . 
  fucken putinbots everywhere trying to divide us !, 
  i 'm yropean and will say nicholas cage whenever i feel like it !, 
  maybe there are no * new * ideas . 
  and somehow , for the world that glorifies people that want us to fly to the mars , ride hoverboards and make amazing ted talks , the lack of ideas in this particular `` niche '' makes it deeply disturbing ? 
  the best way would be for everyone to be super rich and young and beautiful and with golden dicks ( yes , women too ) . 
  so , what exactly you are talking about ? 
  thing is we are not , we are stuck in the `` end of history '' narration . 
  it seems like for the rest of times we are doomed to discuss interest rates and gdp growth ... 
  well shit , maybe it would , thats the point of my post . 
  if we are content with current state of affairs , why do we bitch so much about it ? 
  and how exactly this solves the problem that there is more and more people willing to risk their lives to come to eu ? 
  what is the difference for syrian dude if he is shot in his home country or eu border , given that if he succeeds crossing it , he has a chance for a normal living ? 
  seriously , why do you beat around the bush , lets just put machine gun turrets across our borders to automatically shoot everyone trying to cross it !, 
  sadly this wo n't bring us any closer to solving the problem , but will make it more spectacular !, 
  agreed , but does it mean that there are no better forms of governance in general ? 
  this quote is a handy excuse . 
  big question here is when and why we stopped dreaming/theoreticize about other , better ways of organizing society ? 
  all cool , but you are making an assumption that easter ukraine is all russia wanted in the first place . 
  personally i 'm not so convinced . 
  it looks like putin wants to destabilize the whole country so it stays in the russian sphere of influence ( pretty much like it did through the whole 90s and for the most part of 00s ) . 
  numerous reasons for that : economic ( ukrainian market will stay closely tight to russian ) , control of the ukrainian gas pipelines , keeping the nato buffer ( though to be 100 % honest i have no clue how nato 's east expansion is threatening russia ) finally political ( hitting the imperialistic notes still gives you votes/support in russia ) . 
  sadly in the process 40 something millions of ukrainians are being held hostage by russian policy, 
  fuck it , should be based in game of thrones realm . 
  wales -  dragons -  game of thrones ... bulletproof logic . 
  10 % for this idea !, 
  dude , do n't complain . 
  build your robots and we make them fight aginst our [ giant jesus ] ( http://fotopolska.eu/foto/305/305283.jpg ) for eu membership .
