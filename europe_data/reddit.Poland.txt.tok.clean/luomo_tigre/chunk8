  that is why i think those brave people ultimately died in vain . 
  if we can not learn from such harsh lessons , than i guess we never will . 
  a bit more facts and less `` reenactments '' and national circle-jerk would be a nice change for how we ~ ~ mourn ~ ~ celebrate this national tragedy shortly before the uprising stanis\u0142aw miko\u0142ajczyk was in moscow where in presence of stalin and churchill details of teheran deal were finally outed to the polish side . 
  the fact that poland will be in the soviet zone was clear to everyone including leaders of the home army in poland . 
  there is no doubt about that . 
  furthermore it was clear that british will not support the uprising . 
  jan nowak-jeziora\u0144ski sadly arrived in warsaw with this news two days before the uprising , but still there was time to call it off . 
  there was no strategic reason to start the uprising , it was purely a political decision . 
  what was to be gained , if poles liberated warsaw , is something that is really hard to imagine . 
  so yeah trusting in uncles stalin good will is just ridiculous . 
  must say i 'm not amused by such blunt political stunts pulled by `` research '' institution founded by polish taxpayer . 
  we have ministry of foreign affairs to make political statements . 
  research institutes are for , u know , research . 
  you want to indulge yourself in petty and childish acts of finger-pointing , do it with your private money, 
  agreed , a bullet in the back of this fuckers head was the single best gift we got from soviets . 
  cult of criminals who gave the order to start the uprising is one of the most frightening and tragic elements of our national psyche . 
  scary shit . 
   it 's a mess tru that , my best friend is german dude from heidelberg born to polish parents hailing from wroc\u0142aw ( breslau ) , whose family was relocated from lw\u00f3w ( lviv , lemberg ) where before wwii they were living nice and peaceful jewish life . 
  on the other hand i think german-polish-jews are the master race and will dominate the world some day . 
  i think the proximity to german border has much more to do with this ( north-eastern part of poland was in germany too , hell this is the prussia , and yet is green ) . 
  people living there have strong economical and cultural ties with germany , so i presume it 's easier for them to say ` fuck it , i 'm out ', 
  no problem dude . 
  it 's hard to judge if it was just lack of context on your side ( understandable ) , or you are one of those guys mentioned in the article ( you did flare up out of a sudden , your account is 13 days old and yeah `` grexit '' is hardly an issue in canada ) . 
  so in a `` rare '' occasion you are paid for what you write , few pointers . 
  personally , though annoying , what you do is a ** job ** and hopefully you get a decent pay . 
  it 's hard to take a moral high ground , if you have a problem with paying off your flat and supporting your family . 
  been there done that , good luck !, 
  but dude seriously , radio free europe ... come on have some decency and respect for your ( and mine ) parents . 
  they went through a lots of shit so we can have a slightly better life . 
  it 's just wrong . 
  your country , your future . 
  do as you think will suit it best , but there is no need to attack something that has virtually no relevance for us , but helped our parents get by . 
  cheers !, 
   was it actually though ? 
  it 's hard to imagine a state owned news source whose purpose was specifically to undermine foreign governments as `` propaganda free '' unless you mean more specifically free of soviet propaganda . 
  that 's what i meant , us propaganda was hardly a problem from a perspective of a polish citizen during communist times . 
  lack of information was . 
  and simply ** reporting ** about the scale of protests in the 80s , prague spring , shooting of workers during strikes in 1970 was enough . 
  hardly a propaganda if you ask me . 
  it was not fabricating facts . 
  polish wiki mentions us congress first , so my bad , sorry for that . 
  bottom line is that it was widely and openly known that it is sponsored by us , thus a part of a larger political puzzle . 
  i would just be cautious about sensationalizing it 's existence . 
   is n't this very news organization founded by the cia as part of an anti-communist ( ie pro usa interest ) psy ops campaign ? 
  sorry , no psy-ops-rainbow-six-cia bullshit here . 
  it is quite openly financed by us congress . 
  during communist times it was pretty much the only propaganda free source of news available in communist countries . 
  fun fact is that in communist times in poland it was one of the most popular radio stations . 
  especially during martial law when it was basicly the only reliable source of news . 
  edit : if you 're into some real shady cia shit , i suggest you read about [ student organisations in us ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/a-friend-of-the-devil ), 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka is mostly a tourist thing now . 
  only excuse to drink it , is when mixed with apple juice . 
  then it magically becomes this sweet sweet liquidized apple pie with a nice kick . 
  craft beers and vodkas are rightfully becoming a thing now . 
  [ browar pinta ] ( http://www.browarpinta.pl/ ) and revived [ j.a. 
  this . 
  seriously , please explain !, 
  i 've noticed the same trend here in germany , polish mass produced pisswasser is gaining traction ( definitely not because of the price , as it is labeled as `` imported '' , thus priced slightly premium compared to fine german lagers ) . 
  this is mind boggling to me , because brands like \u017bywiec , tyskie , lech , \u017buber is something that you generally try to avoid back home . 
  especially now , when some good alternatives are widely available ( at least in big cities like warsaw ) . 
  now for sure they taste differently , usually slightly sweeter and less hoppy . 
  but this is most definitely not a secret recipe of polish brewers , but rather a byproduct of industrially accelerated aging . 
  so yeah , please explain !, 
  depending on the specimen i would say . 
  [ some are really good ] ( http://www.smaczajama.pl/sklep/userdata/gfx/699ebcef65f577ca05d8e0ab352c21ec.jpg ) , while other [ just ok ] ( http://www.bangla.pl/foto/prod//0031/d/986_01_7393.jpg ), 
  tenders are really just smart part of the story ( and rest assured we have problems with them in poland too ) . 
  once you get the business there is even more little miracles here , there and everywhere . 
  for example , you work with really smart guys employed by the public sector - great dudes , meme game strong . 
  then one day , out of the blue , their email domain changed to some private company that has no trace in the internet ... wtf you think !? 
  well , as it turned out , some higher-up realized that there is money to be made . 
  let 's get this guys with unique knowhow , put them in a private company , and charge the state for basically the same services , but with a nice fat margin on top !, 
  cool for them ( i mean higher-ups , doubt that guys we were working with saw any of this money ) , cool for us , because we made some nice bonus profit , by overcharging them ruthlessly for a shitty website of this new company . 
  i work for german tech company sometimes doing business with russia ( or at least trying , starting in public tenders without a russian partner that can `` arrange things '' is a waste of time ) . 
  would have some amazing stories to tell , if not for my contract : < ( and the fact i really like my job ) . 
  when it comes to soft infrastructure ( banking , telecommunication ) poland and other countries of former eastern block are pretty advanced , even when compared to western europe . 
  it should n't be surprising as all this needed to be build from scratch after 1990 . so not only you will be able to pay with your card virtually everywhere ( i once paid 5 cents for box of matches with a card - smoker problems : < ) , but you will be able to do it contactless . 
  if you have an enabled card ( pretty much all cards issued in poland at the moment are ) or nfc capable phone or very soon smartwatch or fitnessband , you can enjoy living in the future . 
  and mind you , contactless payment is not a gimmick here , it 's quite ubiquitous . 
  people growned to rely on it - i once got frowned upon by fellow customer queuing behind me , because i paid with my stupid german card which apparently takes ages ( he was a yuppie dickhead , probably in a hurry to show his amazing powerpoint to some other dickheads ) . 
  now few years back i moved to germany , land of plentiful , and was forced to re-discover cash . 
  no but for realz , it 's crazy here . 
  i mean wtf crazy . 
  you can go to a fancy restaurant , make a bill way above few hundred euros and still be asked to pay in cash . 
  and my online banking website is stuck in late 90s ( hell it probably still uses altavista for search ) . 
  or this funky ec cards , that are useless once you leave german speaking world ( well maybe if you are hardcore cocaine user , you could still find it handy ) . 
  or dropping calls on mobile , a phenomenon i encountered first time in my life here in germany in the fucken middle of berlin ( vodafone pls go fuck yourself ) . 
  add to this retarded youtube blocking and you start to question is it really polandball that `` can not into space '' ... 
  yup , this was a tricky one . 
  polish name for aachen comes from latin `` aquisgrana '' . 
  and for why it has its own name in polish - it has probably a lot to do with charlemagne and the fact that aachen was his prefered residence . 
  nice , now try akwizgran, 
   as usual , hard to generalize . 
  europe is not homogenous , especially when it comes to migration . 
  western europe had a pretty large influx of vietnamese `` boat people '' in the 80 's . 
   it may surprise you but we in eastern europe ( including ddr ) have our own share of vietnamese citizens . 
  due to the cooperation between `` brother socialist nations '' considerable amount of vietnamese people came to eastern block to study , some of them stayed and brought their families . 
  well , you do n't want to know the polish names for some of german cities , this is where it gets perverse . 
  small sample - without googling it guess which german city is called in polish chociebu\u017c . 
  have fun !, 
  yes , i enjoy sucking cocks , no matter the nationality ( though the bigger , the better ... sorry political correctness ) but if you ask me about german policy right now , yes as a polish person i 'm infuriated .
