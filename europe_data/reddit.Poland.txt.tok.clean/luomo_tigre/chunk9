  it seems that the german business is put in front of what is morally and politically better for europe as a whole, 
  1 . well , you are a radical nutjob , +1 for you 2 . 
  germany lost both world wars , and yet is is still the biggest economy in europe ... if that is not the sign that they are doing something right , than what is ? 
  3 . they are not the biggest country in europe , yet they are the biggest country in europe ( for better or worse , angela is still * only * extremely worried , about what is happening in ukraine ) 4 . the fact that poland is not as rich as germany can be equally accounted for : we are not as big ag germany , we are not as smart as germany , we are not as fortunate as germany . 
  deal with it !, 
  dude i saw what germans and brits are working with ... slavic genome will rule this continent, 
  damn you fellow slav !, 
  i thought it is is clear by now we pose as losers in europe , just to make westerners unaware that we in fact take over their land !, 
  dude , you are just deprived of your basic need for [ kosher vodka ] ( http://www.kmdelikatesy.pl/files/zdjecia_produktow/10041053.jpg ) and gefilte fish ( aka `` ryba po grecku '' consumed by every polish family during christmas ) . 
  we really miss you guys , stop your foolish american rendezvous and come back to europe at once !, 
  let 's be honest , it is an all-round european thing , we just happen to enjoy having mediterraneans around , mostly for jokes , bailouts and pizza, 
  well , sex cams is not a reall work ... 
  first , as an american you wo n't definitely be classified as immigrant . 
  `` immigrants '' is how we in europe call the problem of less fortunate and economically impaired citizens . 
  you at least call it by name . 
  we use sophisticated language to hide our problems . 
  welcome to europe !, 
  second , those 28 paid days off is basically a standard here , not to mention a free healthcare or higher education . 
  now , it is most definitely not `` free '' as we just pay it off by much higher taxes ( aka welfare state ) . 
  so if you are averse to paying up to 50 % of your nominal income to the state , you will have a bad time here . 
  and `` nominal '' is very crucial here , because we tend to think about our income in net ( netto ) terms not in gross ( brutto ) . 
  big difference . 
  third , europe is a very diverse place . 
  if you are one of those americans that think that the difference between germany and spain is basicly like california versus minnesota , you will have a bad time . 
  lastly , if you really want to enjoy european welfare state i invite you to read about scandinavia . 
  sure , those guys are boring as fuck , but they have their shit sorted out when it comes to having a care-free life . 
  bitch please ... [ pickled herring and ice cold vodka . 
  thing . 
  ever . 
  btw . 
  this brown thingy - this is how bread suppose to look like, 
  to be totally honest turkish minority is probably boosting this stats for you . 
  it 's not that much complaining ( which as you mentioned is not a unique feature of polish people ) , but rather something that , for lack of a better word , i would call `` negative-first '' approach . 
  in every situation ( even positive ) as a polish person you are conditioned to find a negative side . 
  i live and work in germany since few years now . 
  and i still fondly remember a chat i had with my first boss here . 
  some weeks after i started my job , he called me to his office and politely , but firmly , explained that , as much as he appreciates me finding problems all over the place , he pays me to solve those problems , not to complain about them . 
  finding problems is genuinely a good thing , as it shows that : 1 . 
  i care about what i do 2 . 
  i am smart enough to notice those issues , but if he gets one more email that starts with `` this sucks ... '' , without a follow up '' ... but we could solve it by ... '' i can consider myself fired . 
  needles to say , this worked wonders for me . 
  well , at least the father lifts ... polska stronk !, 
  ( help !, 
  germans are beating me up !, 
  ) ] ( https://youtu.be/bgrvjna5qh8 ) context : reference to an episode of a beloved polish sitcom `` politics in poland '' . 
  synopsis : popular polish conservative politician jan-maria rokita is flying from berlin with lufthansa . 
  while boarding , stewardess tries a sneaky anschluss of his coat peacefully laying on an empty seat next to him . 
  mr. rokita promptly realizes that this is a violation of his ( and his coat 's ) european human rights . 
  then he proceeds to free his coat from a compartment and , in a heroic act of civic disobedience , places it on an empty seat in the business class . 
  stewardess is not amused . 
  so is captain . 
  together , in what can be only compared to a shameful ribbentrop-molotov pact , they plot a devilish plan to crash polish beacon of freedom - they call airport security . 
  as polish army in 1939 , mr. rokita quickly falls under blitzkrieg of german might . 
  in a last cry of freedom mr. rokita does what every pole would do on his place - blames all on the germans . 
  some sound co-passenger records all this on her phone . 
  hilarity ensues . 
  aftermath : in following seasons of `` politics in poland '' mr. rokita was removed from the cast . 
  as for the coat , it 's whereabouts are still unclear . 
  probably it shared the fate of many polish art pieces and memorabilia stolen by germans in the wwii . 
   a buddy of mine told me once ( ... ) yup , this is how 90 % of scientific papers start, 
  does it also applies to poles living abroad ? 
  because it would scare the living shit out of my lovely berlin neighbours , when one day i started to run around my neighborhood in a polish uniform , with an ak in hand shouting `` kurwa do boju , uraaa ... '' edit : on the other hand , this is berlin , i would probably blend in ... 
  ah yes , the charlie hebdo motive seems very plausible . 
  at this point it would not surprise me , if russian investigators started calming that those chechens actually took part in paris shootings , or jfk assassination or death of bambi 's mother ... 
  exactly !, 
  why is the concept of `` continental europe '' any worse than `` mainland europe '' ? 
  galicja in general , which extends up to ukrainian border . 
  source : my father is from sandomierz and says `` na pole '', 
   i love such maps because they are showing that even a chinese culture had an influence in europe . 
  it 's totally wrong calling america a melting pot . 
  europe is the true melting pot !, 
  yup , as long as those `` influences '' do not come on rafts through mediterranean . 
  then we tend to be annoyed . 
  nahh , we have also many words taken from latin . 
  if i called you `` idiota '' , you would probably understand , 
  well , depends how far east you are willing to go ... you go `` na dw\u00f3r '' or `` na pole '' ? 
  great job , thanks for the effort - much appreciated !, 
  i would also draw your attention to / u/skinnj comment . 
  it really looks painful when nouns in german are not capitalized . 
  and when you 're at it , it would be simply amazing if you could also include the grammatical gender of this words ( be it a pronoun for romance and germanic languages or simply a letter ) . 
  know this is much more work but pretty pretty please ... lol english u do n't even compute what i just wrote , u so basic, 
  if she comes from schlesien that does not necessarily mean she was german ... she could be polish , jewish or czech for that matter . 
  and even if she was german ( the fact you use word schlesien kinda suggests it ) keep in mind that her german was most probably of schlesisch dialect . 
  which i guess is ( was ? ), 
  heavily influenced by west slavic ( aka polish ) . 
  likewise polish '' \u015bl\u0105ski '' dialect uses many german words ( to the extent that it is barely understandable to a polish person ) . 
  hope i could help !, 
  ** actually sweden , [ gib back sweden !,

  oh cool , so it 's almost as long as [ avinguda diagonal ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/avinguda_diagonal ) in barcelona , 
  depends on what kind of `` fun '' you 're into , i guess . 
  but us has it 's own detroit , so it 's only fair we finally have one in europe !, 
   yeah in german-speaking countries you use both , but d\u00f6ner is more common when spoken . 
  plus d\u00f6ner is usually served in a thick bun , whereas d\u00fcr\u00fcm is a flatbread wrap . 
  in poland when ordering a kebab you need to specify what type of wrap/bun you want . 
  obviously germans had to optimized this procedure . 
  hail to our teutonic overlords !, 
  wtf czechs ?!, 
  why u not into ~ ~ colonizing ~ ~ immigrating into uk ? 
   i have a problem with gross .
