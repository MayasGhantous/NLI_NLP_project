we have good players but the team sucks . 
  almost every one of them plays outside of poland , and they do n't have much occasion to train together . 
  the polish league sux . 
  and i think that they do n't want to risk injuries and hang on tightly to their precious contracts in rich clubs . 
  i think that a regular league of european national teams would boost the level of the teams very much . 
  poland , east . 
  triggered, 
  well , for starts they 're not friends with the ` muricans, 
  weimar triangle is not an official structure . 
  neither is v4 . 
  no wonder that brits get so hammered in krak\u00f3w , the low prices confuse them and when they check their wallets after a few pints they think that they just drank the first one . 
  sorta , as a joke . 
  since tusk left for his job at eu his party , po , the leader of the current government is in full suicide mode . 
  the long cold war between aldi nord and s\u00fcd has just become hot !, 
  aldi goes nucular !,

  a great dane he was . 
   ** to work illegally ** of course they could n't get benefits or work legally outside of poland . 
  their prospects in poland are so bleak that they 'll just risk working illegally abroad . 
  if they 'll get caught they 'll just get deported to poland and go west again as soon as they can . 
  poland is ( and was in the past ( un-stats 2009-10 .5 k , 2010-6 .5 k , 2011-6 .9 k ) ) accepting refugees . 
  from the east . 
  ( mosty from the caucasus region ) as per the first safe country doctrine . 
  they do n't get much money . 
  migrants from the middle east and north africa do n't want to come here , and obviously prefer richer , closer countries and forcing them wo n't solve the problem because they 'll go to richer countries to work illegally . 
  there is no way of keeping them here unless you dismantle schengen and fortify the borders to north korea levels . 
  we do n't have the money to integrate them properly and have more pressing issues to spend money on . 
  ( pensions , healthcare , which are still far below western european standards ) germany gives 0 fucks about us when it comes to our energy safety ( nordstream ) , and oppose nato bases on our territory so why we should give fucks about the refugees they invited and do n't want to accept ? 
  only 9.6 in poland , i was under the impression that there are much more like at least 15 . 
  you have probably never been to a large open air music festival .

  it emerged because some idiot rapper is using it all the time . 
  poland went to space in the same intercosmos program as you romania so sit down . 
  hitching rides with uncle ussr does n't count . 
  how about no, 
   i came into this country  to leave a life of trouble  but ever since since i got here man  my blood pressure has doubled  these promises of freedom  and mammary attractions  turned out to be a bunch of crap  and misleading distractions ( soundtrack ) [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxmlvlspd1y],

  germany looks for a final solution of the immigrant problem . 
  sometimes it astounds me how clueless people in western europe are on how things work in post-socialist economies . 
   anti-putin  nord-stream pick one, 
  both around -5 's but it 's a shitty survey , no option to cast `` not sure '' . 
  a real life country-ball . 
  i 'm ok with that as long as germoney picks up the tab . 
  `` sorry this video can only be streamed in greece '', 
  it was probably the tarmac temperature or the air thermometer was backing in the sun . 
  well , mig-29 is a much better fighting jet than those pictured . 
  that 's their way of securing income , to inspire pity . 
  the kids are often druged and/or drunk , so they do n't cry and do n't move . 
  recently in my city ( pozna\u0144 , poland ) there was a gypsy woman begging with a dog pup that was saturated with alcohol in above 30c weather . 
  unfortunately the dog died . 
  made in poland .

  well it 's still 1/4 of price of med-school in poland . 
  5-6k euro for med-school a year . 
  much better version, 
  internet ruined bae for me . 
  that was 18 years ago . 
  the same for poland . 
  after `` lucy '' i do n't trust in besson as a sf movie director .

  what the american meant : '' ... a smallish city such as helsinki in a sparsely populated country ... '', 
  well on the serious note : it depends . 
  firstly you have to consider supply and demand . 
  things like competition in the home and international markets . 
  basically subsidies are an income like any other , if you loose it and need it ( for taxes , bills , supplies and mortgage and leasing payments ) , you 'll have to find another source of income . 
  if the demand is higher than the supply you are free to rise the prices . 
  on the other hand if the supply is higher the producers would try to dump everything they can on the market , below the cost of production to get back some money and to stay afloat . 
  that would be followed by a round of bankruptcies and consolidation . 
  with a probable monopoly ( or oligopoly ) brewing if the situation persists long enough , which would lead to a price increase .
