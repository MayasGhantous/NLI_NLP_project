  although i agree about most of your points one of them are straight up idolising . 
  `` schools were violence free and drug free . '', 
  no school is ever 100 % violence free , and while drugs may have been a smaller problem , the main source of kicks then were opiates , which are much more dangerous than pot . 
  1 . because they 're much more addictive . 
  2 . because of them being injected , coupled with a lack of one time use needles and syringes , spread if hiv and hepatitis was a serious issue . 
  also ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz , the guy that invented the kerosene lamp and petroleum refining . 
  do n't sink me no morse,

  if only tesla had a cheap model . 
  ( like 12 thousand euro cheap ), 
  true , but upa still sucks . 
  and siergei yesienin hanged himself . 
  claims of one guy are not `` facts '' unless it was peer reviewed and confirmed by another unrelated group of scientists . 
   must w\u00f6rk more . 
  will w\u00f6rk for w\u00f6rk . 
  one paper written by a british guy is hardly any revelation . 
  or like we say , `` raz na ruski rok '' , `` once in a russian year '', 
  and my favourite `` wo\u0142czer '' .

  frame after frame , loving oiling of a gun . 
  silky barrel is hugging the hand - you with a camera , i with a piece . 
  war is for the living . 
  only in the war man is happy . 
  a doctor , a musicologist , a peasant , a teacher . 
  `` to die for the fatherland - that is the life '' posing for the pictures in their familly-squad . 
  bodies going down with the indifferent flow of the river . 
  long ago burnt out stars send their dead light from afar their own star inside everybody can extinguish or save . 
  [ when heard this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
  tobacco itself is cheap as dirt , rolling it to a cigarette costs are relative to cost of conducting businesses in certain country , most of the cost are taxes .

  well that explains why my ex gf wanted to go on erasmus to spain so bad . 
  looks like a siemens combino ripoff . 
  it 's just what happens when a certain good is very scarce , at least people have the comfort of fighting over an artificial need than a basic one .
