came here to make gulash reference ... nope, 
  the `` nederlands '' sign is obviously shopped , and the speed limits are skewed further proving it 's fake picture, 
  of course !, 
  just like they 're liberating poor ucrainians now ;-), 
  poland : mention `` polish death camps '' :-), 
  same in poland with shoes and drinking ;-), 
  you forgot to blindfold lady justice , and probably pigeon too ;-) anyway , those are better propaganda posters than russian ones picturing obama with a banana, 
  no , `` tradition or belief still lives on in your country '' doeas n't state it should be country specific, 
  have you read the question ? 
  `` pre-christian tradition or belief still lives on in your country '' , i think christianized celebrations of old - non christian traditions fit in perfectly, 
  no , he meant pagan pre-christian , it means roman too, 
  christmas as reminescent of [ saturnalia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saturnalia ), 
  at first i was like downvote , but i upvoted you after a while ... some translation 's here are horrible, 
  nice video , but 360p , what year is that ? 
  also , am i only one who read `` european ** electronics ** : how it works ? '' ? 
  or maybe [ kitler ] ( http://www.catsthatlooklikehitler.com/ ) ? 
  [ ^ nudge ^ nudge ^ ^ wink ^ ^ wink ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona-rhlfrfc ) ;-), 
  i mean computer games , in most wwii themed games you do n't see swastikas, 
  i thought about kitty picture , black kitty , in pentagram ... ;-), 
  but not in games ; /, 
  it 's not that only german words we know in poland are `` do n't shoot '' and `` hands in the air '' ;-) of course i know other meanings of `` furer '' word , 
  thanks ;-) now i just have to think about some occultist worthy cakeday post ;-), 
  yeah , i know the meaning is different here , i just pointed it out , the association is n't ** that ** forced , do n't you think ? 
  and bananas ;-), 
  i know i know , the context is different , i just noticed three verses beginning with `` ein '' and it made a connection ;-) maybe because i 'm polish , and we 're considered oversensitive about this kind of things ;-), 
  the fourth one sounds like `` ein volk , ein reich , ein f\u00fchrer '' , just saying ;-) i heared there is hard antinazi censorship in germany so i 'm wondering how this went through, 
  croatian ajvar ? 
   it 's not a full dish , but i love it :-), 
  vodka is more polish beverage, 
  polish flag would n't be hard to do , just vodka over something red [ grenadine ? ], 
  the tap water in poland is exceptionally clean , i guess people just got hooked up on all this bottled water scam , let 's not forget refilling pet bottles is unhygienic , refilling dedicated containers is better idea imo , also if you 're tourist it 's not easy to drink only tap water , drinking bottled water in home having tap water is not common practice too :-), 
  if i may ask , why such selection of countries ? 
  why poland , turkey and hungary ? 
  i 'm just curious , 
  as a pole sometimes i 'd like my country to be governed by germans , seriosly , history aside it 's the best available option for being other country governing poland , autobahns , railways , relatively low unemployment and politics that actually do things etc , but only sometimes :-), 
  because you 're fucking nationalist nazi if you do n't agree :-), 
  i wanted to write about plitvice national park , but somebody was faster , i was also in sybenik and trogir , 10/10 would recomend :-), 
  yeah , or wv : `` from berlin to warsaw in one tank '' :-), 
  geez , at first i 've read `` was sued for '' and was like wtf :-), 
  in poland we call it `` ciupaga '' , they were very popular among mountainers ( g\u00f3rale ), 
  i was in palanga two years ago and the roads were fine , better than polish section on trip from my hometown bia\u0142ystok , 
  it 's because we polish love flattery , sadly due to our inferiority complex , also nobody mentioned about ww2 `` polish death camps '' this time , so it 's time to celebrate !, 
  of course i wanted to share with other redditors , otherwise i 'd paste link to polish wikipedia ;-) anyway i do n't even dare to doubt in your skills in searching the internets, 
  maybe in underground , they 're illegal in poland , besides , according to some left-wing polish media everyone who goes out with national flag in polish independence day is a blood hungry nazi nationalist , and do n't forget about recently popular `` polish death camps '' term, 
  not to mention his red hair ... 
  and sex :-), 
  that 's why highways are rarity in poland :d, 
  i 've heard now germans living near boundary with poland are faking car theft more and more , 
  you 're right , i was in warsaw some time ago , and it was a disaster , billboards everywhere !, 
  yes , we definitely have some wonderful piece of history together , and we remember about p\u00e1l teleki !, 
  ah , yes , `` schei\u00dfe '' is common curse word in poland too , i know the difference , and i think my spelling mistake is so insignificant it could be considered a typo ;-), 
  in my country [ poland ] we are joking about polish complaining , we 're complaining on everything , even if we acheive success , 
  at least we 're better drivers than russians :d, 
  yeah , and almost every pole knows some words in german because of ww2 , like `` h\u00e4nde hoch '' [ hands in the air ] , `` papieren bitte '' [ papers please ] and `` nicht schissen '' [ do n't shoot ] ;-), 
  am i the only on here who thinks it feels influenced by some religious groups ? 
  so another question , why hungary wo n't let them go to germany ? 
  according to theology *** ascension *** is when one is ascending to the heavens by `` himself '' , like jesus , mary was * arisen * to heavens by someone else ( god ? 
  ) , thus *** assumption ***, 
  well , i find it sad that so many christian holidays are based on roman concepts , like [ christmas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saturnalia ) for example also i 'm supprised it 's national holiday in secular france, 
  wow , i 'll definitely take it into account when traveling to lithuania ( if not sightseeing in vilnus ), 
  yeah , the name sounds kinda tropical ;-), 
  i think he was just thinking that speaking german itself was an insult ;-), 
  well it 's still less expensive than polish sea resorts , so maybe i 'll visit turkey next time ;-), 
  well , hungarians have an advantage here , as their language is unlike any other language around , even different from other finougric languages , 
  maybe , the russian speakers was majority there , but when a friend asked for a room some people seemed not to understand  more and more poles visit palanga as it 's less expensive than polish sea resorts ( do n't know how it is now , after euro came in ) , and vilnus is from historical reasons , [ like germans visiting gda\u0144sk , szczecin and wroc\u0142aw , except we do n't call vilnus ours anymore ;-) ] also the city is beatiful , 
  well , when we ( polish ) were in [ palanga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palanga ) with friends and nobody spoke even basic english , especially in restaurants servers were expecting us to order in lithuanian , all we heared was `` nobody speak lithuanian ? '', 
  from them , so we just assumend they do n't like poles and do n't want to speak english , but it 's not a problem when lithuanians come to buy stuff in poland , their english is good and their polish is most fluent amongst foreigners , 
  first two which came to my mind are both norwegian and have hunt theme in their titles - '' [ trolljegeren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollhunter ) '' and '' [ hodejegerne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headhunters_\\ ( film \\ ) ) '' ( norwegian-swedish ), 
  i 'm really surprised support from poland is such strong , considering our love of independence , we fought for it many times , the same with hungary , it 's just weird that formerly oppressed countries are such supportive for idea of loosing some fragment of their independence , like being part of warsaw pact in the past was n't enough ... 
  i think it 's comparable to borders between three states in usa ;-), 
  dunno why , but i thought the green color would be expressed with some kind of herb \u2190 _ \u2190, 
  well it 's the same here in poland , but not so even , i mean , this people stand like they measured and optimised distance between them, 
  two germans went to paris and tried to pose as english people , they went to restaurant and order : `` two martini please ! '', 
  the server asks : `` wet or dry ? '', 
  well . . no flag means white flag , right ? 
  it would be still against the law , though according to the bill , mother would face minor consequences , to be frank there is a lot of misconceptions about this bill , people are just repeating false claims after leftist media , for example its not placing the life of a child above life or health of a mother , so it 's not that they would force a woman to carry an ectopic fetus like they keep saying , because who the fuck checks his facts nowadays ? 
  saying that i do not condone this bill , is undeniably hurting to women in poland, 
  yeah , even amongst jews themselves, 
  of course , i knew that , my nation ( or rather the area of my country ) was directly involved in this shit , i was just confused by lack of quotation marks, 
  i wonder why people ask why other nationalities visit their country, 
  maybe it ~ ~ malaysia ~ ~ indonesia ? 
  or monaco ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious ** edit ** : i know now, 
  only practical question here ;-) but a bit fucked up , why they chose a query where english is n't used as nationality ? 
  i thought it 's polish thing but now it 's regional , personally as a pole i prefer garlic sauce ( yogurt based ) , also what to use on bunch of melted cheese than ketchup ? 
  i wonder what will happen when search engines start to censor themselves to work it around this making publishers nonexistent in the internet, 
  lithuania : `` hey everyone !, 
  there is free coffee ! '', 
  plot twist : only 100 came lookin for a job, 
  yeah , but our `` righties '' will never be pro-putin , or pro-russia , you know , partitions , wwii , years of communism and now smolensk , nope , not going to happen, 
  wow , looks worse than here in poland , ours own just national media and are anti putin , trump-neutral , anti-eu and anti-refugee , but yeah , they crippled education too, 
  at least your supreme leader is a pm , has a wife and kids , owns a bank account , ours is just `` regular '' deputy , an * \u00e9minence grise * , and is delusional paranoic, 
  wow , i 'm surprised at poland , seriously , 
  soo , what 's the thing with turkish officials in netherlands ? 
  let me guess , german owner was crying when selling it ? 
  yeah , but those were germans too, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylaggwj_iyg ) came to my mind, 
  sometimes i wonder how would pop culture look like now if not the holocaust , i mean imagine all those jewish entertainers , like moshe goldbaum instead of michael jackson , music , film industry etc, 
  because people have to hate someone , right ?
