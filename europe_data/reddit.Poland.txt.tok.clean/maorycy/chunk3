  i hope that does n't happen, 
  no , just french superiority complex showing off, 
  turkey could be one , too, 
  is n't like this : denmark and sweden are an old couple , and norway is their child who was first in custody of denmark , then sweden , then grew up, 
  not frozen russian conflicts . 
  see transnistria and georgia . 
  poland does n't have a war on its border, 
  we need a plague . 
  when you add ukraine to the equation you get commonpoor thoutght, 
  there are some luxembourgers here . 
  however , they are all from belgian luxembourg . 
  what are the words where it means `` sz '' ? 
   are allowed to study in poland for free only those with a pole card, 
  having low population may sound not so bad . 
  but you have to realize that the country is not only becoming smaller , but it 's coming to the point when most people are of old age . 
  that is something that should never happen . 
   multi-millionaire in what currency ? 
  try harder, 
  when it comes to electronics , usually they are more expensive here, 
  no the truth is that all kinds of people move : educated , uneducated , the byd\u0142o ( one of the reasons why our crime rate is so low ), 
  this is why united europe is a bad idea , we do n't need that kind of monstrosity . 
  regional blocks would be much better idea , like the nordics , v4 , etc. 
  people in those have similar way of thinking , financial state , tradition and history and languages ( mostly ), 
  there is some truth to what you 're saying , because grand duchy of moscow wanted to show they 're the only true ruthenian state, 
   all these kids who use the kotwica as a nationalistic symbol i see no connection between these too . 
  especially when polish nationalism is just amplified patriotism, 
   what other ways are there for lithuanians to think that they are lithuanian ? 
  it 's a long story , all i can give you atm is [ this ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2flitwini_w_znaczeniu_historycznym&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  yes , he was lithuanian , but not in the way modern lithuanians think of themselves . 
   \u0424\u043e\u043a\u044a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 so you put \u044a in bulgarian when there is an * e * that dissapears in certain positions ? 
   just do the romanian word for `` meet '' + the romanian word/s for `` the fockers '' it would probably be something like `` meet the focker family '' . 
  translate that into bulgarian then . 
  that `` c '' is not pronounced like `` k '' , but like the `` z '' in english `` pizza '' . 
  does that make it better ? 
  that 's a strangely arbitrary metric to choose, 
  do you have a video or a recording ? 
   also , jokingly , when you pronounce `` dupa '' ( `` doopa '' , as in `` doom '' ) with '' \u0142 '' ( `` w '' in `` wash '' ) . 
  what am i reading there is no \u0142 in dupa, 
  as v4 has been for past 25 years , maybe it will get closer but who knows, 
  at the beginning of the 19th century , most of the people of france spoke in their regional dialect as their first language . 
  later they suppressed the other languages to push ^ ^ ^ ^ artificial parisian in it 's place, 
   you can spot a posh speaker of polish language if they can articulate nasal vowels properly . 
  we even call such people as `` being \u0105 \u0119 '' ( \u0105 and \u0119 being the nasal vowels in question ) , although that description now applies more to people who try too hard to come across as being part of the intellectual upper class of society . 
  that said , standard pronuncation is o/e followed by a nasal glide ( [ \u0254w\u0303 ] , [ \u025bw\u0303 ] ) , when someone tries to be `` hypercorrect '' they say [ \u0254\u0303 ] , [ \u025b\u0303 ], 
  and wales . 
  and italy in polish - w\u0142ochy . 
  it 's not like they 're gon na fire everyone from those stations , barely anything will change for the workers, 
   and they acted like sworn enemies for centuries nice historical knowledge . 
  slovakia has only existed for like 100 years . 
  before that , it was integral part of the country just like finland to sweden , or wales to england . 
  that 's central europe for you , everyone has them from brandenburg to slovenia, 
  these changes change nothing on the matter of making the spelling reflect pronunciation . 
  most of those are just diacritic removals but diacritics are often not mandatory in french , so it 's useless . 
  it already is . 
  german has really consistent and logical phonemic orthography . 
  the french , on the other hand , decided to base theirs on already outdated parisian spelling of 17th century and not go any further in time . 
  cyrillic is not really better , because in the eastern languages the vowels are marked as soft , while in polish it would be more useful to mark the softness in the consonants, 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  patriotism is about loving your country , nationalism is about loving your people . 
  in the middle ages , patriotism was a lot more popular, 
   ex-urss poland was not a part of the soviet union . 
   his supporters ( ... ) believe who cares ? 
  what about ted cruz himself ? 
  do you not realize it is an exceptional sector ? 
  it 's not an indicator of economical improvement . 
  just because you live relatively well says nothing about the general state of things . 
  yea , it seems that americans are so obsessed with race they forget how culture and nationality would matter more . 
  actually if the crimea vote was legit in 2014 , i 'm sure they would have joined russia on their own . 
  do n't know about all the people but russia deserves the sanctions etc. 
  for that because they 're hostile again europe . 
  forgot the french symbol : ^ ), 
  unicorns and dragons also appear in heraldry , so i think it 's not a big deal to have a lion there, 
   i prefer democracy and freedoms over wealth . 
  i prefer values over money . 
  why do you think it 's a choice between those two, 
  lithuanians complaining about polish nationalism are even worse than the polish doing it, 
  i chose dclauzel ironically in the survey ... 
  i would n't blame all of this on laziness , it 's much easier to focus on the dialog when you hear it in your first language , than if you have to read the text all the time . 
   few-month-old no-flair accounts everyone that disagrees with me must be a part of le stormfront brigade , amarite ? 
  `` ex-nazi germany to take in 2 million refugees '', 
  not really , you can still hear the original voices . 
  and it 's useful for people who do n't know other languages, 
   the world would be a better place if we thought genesis instead of evolution i though only some american protestant sects ~ ~ deny ~ ~ take the bible literally . 
  where do you live ? 
   in that largely both peoples wanted it not really , it was a loud minority in both halves who wanted division . 
   gay or straight is not an achievement , it 's not a lifestyle ( unless you 're an attention seeker ) . 
  it 's not a philosophy . 
  it 's who you like having sex with , that 's it . 
  sex . 
  this may sound like a dumb question , but is there no such thing as platonic gay relationship ? 
  both pis and tories form one party in the europarliament . 
   acutally yeah , with all those acutes ( \u00b4 \u00b4 \u00b4 \u00b4 \u00b4 \u00b4 ) instead of apostrophes ( '' '' '' '' '' '' ), 
  this may look like a shitpost but actually that is the average polish impression when hearing lithuanian, 
  these dialects would probably be closer to ukrainian and belarusian than german, 
  that was during the partitions , when it was home to greatest polish artists . 
  krak\u00f3w had it own republic for a while as well, 
  would n't poland be in the same place if it didnt include kazakhstan ? 
  tha\u0165s actually true, 
  how do you know ? 
  there 's this thing called kronika policyjna,
