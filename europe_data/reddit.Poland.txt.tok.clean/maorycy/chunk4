  in slavic languages , there are soft and hard consonant pairs . 
  \u0141 is the hard one , l is soft . 
  also , it 's not an ancient slavic name but a one made up by one chronicler . 
   i did not believe the second part about cyclists and vegetarians at first , but apparently it is true it 's a shitty bad taste joke that some people take too seriously, 
  could be the slavic thing of adding v - in front of words that begin with a vowel, 
   `` olasz '' ( `` italian ) '' comes from slavic `` vlah '' , meaning `` romanian '' ( `` vlach '' ) . 
  i 'm not sure why it came to mean italian . 
  you 're mistaken on that part, 
  no one cares, 
  using a non-phonetical language to describe sounds is disgusting . 
  learn ipa . 
   ija is a suffix , like - \u0438\u044f in russian . 
  it just means it 's a feminine word no it 's a loan `` word '' . 
  you have - \u0438\u044f and - ija where you 'd have - ia in latin . 
   i think , culturally , we could form a single country without it crashing and burning we could n't , the ukraine is way poorer and more corrupt than us . 
  even slovakia would be a better candidate , as it 's much closer in that matter and since nationalism took the place of patriotism in the world , these multi-ethnic states seem kind of impossible . 
   once the current party losses the next election it 's been 2 months since they formed the government and we have 4 years to go . 
  way too early to tell, 
  what 's your point ? 
  i 'm just saying that the pope sees europe more like an argentinian than his predecessors . 
  and he 's the first pope from the new world . 
  and i said `` basically '' because the ones you mentioned lived hundred years ago . 
  and back then , i imagine syria or asia minor were closer culturally to rome than let 's say sweden . 
   way to change your stance like every other stupid politician in europe . 
   what makes europe so idealistic anyway ? 
  the thing is , he 's ( basically ) the first pope from outside of europe . 
   and gets a military of its own to match . 
  as far as i 'm aware , the representives of the new government have expressed that the polish military is too small and they want to change that . 
  so the two wo n't contradict each other , it seems . 
  i do n't really see your point . 
  seeing all the island nations you never hear about , i though this article was about the inhibitants of the island lesbos, 
   laj  cu please stop using foreign language acronyms , no one knows what your talking about also civic union is a bad translation, 
  you misunderstood the map the light blue signifies that the land belongs to europe but the majority of the country 's territory does not . 
   hopefully the uk would also block any sanctions on poland . 
  they most likely will . 
  both tories and pis make one party in the european parliament, 
   they have to leave when their homeland is some sort of stable . 
  they wo n't . 
  now even if the war ends , their emigration hurts syria even more . 
  pozna\u0144 , yes, 
  `` closed homogeneous '' is not the same as intolerant, 
  fun fact : greater poland is actually smaller than poland . 
  look it up, 
   pierogi instead of kn\u00f6del wtf ? 
  knedle are equivalent to knoedel , not pierogi in any way, 
   instead he just met a simple mp everyone knows it was n't that better and simpler explanation : it was a meeting of the party leaders, 
  if it 's just gold i do n't see how that belongs in a museum, 
  they trade with the whole world , this is very important, 
  does the change to euro really matter that much ? 
  your old currency was tied to it anyway, 
  me too thanks, 
  well , there 's no war . 
  if there was , it would be all different, 
  why ? 
  not much has changed , it 's still women that bear children, 
  the reason for that is historical and also the fact that female lives are more precious when it comes to the population growth ^ ( edit : why the downvotes ? 
  it 's not even an opinion , it 's a fact . ), 
  more like / r/europe need better news sources , look at the recent articles here on poland, 
  there was no public outcry because it fit someone 's agenda, 
  how does that make it better, 
   when he is not `` drunk '' he has good speeches . 
  so never ? 
  it 's a fake though, 
   result of a public school education he got his education in eton , how is that public ? 
  [ of course they do ] ( http://www.louayfatoohi.com/wp-content/uploads/small%20arms%20survey%20in%202007%20-%20large.jpg ), 
  ignores 45 year period of communism, 
   and then be shipped back to there original country to educate there own . 
  not happening sadly , brains will be brained, 
  me too thanks, 
   novi sad you have something like this [ 1 ] http://static.rtv.rs/slike/2013/07/12/lsv-visejezicna-tabla_660x330.jpg why does it say '' \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0434 '' two times ? 
  actually hungarian is so easy even small children can learn it, 
  we usually say we have 3 genders , but actually there are 5 in polish, 
   we tried really hard to find latin etymologies for slavic words that 's cute, 
   are you expected to know all of them ? 
  are you for real , mate, 
  finland is full of swamps and lakes , that 's a major barrier lithuania is a flat pancake, 
  you 're thinking of january, 
   due to an anomaly related to the d'hondt method , in the first time in the history of the democratic poland , a single party won the majority of seats in sejm with only 37.58 % of the votes . 
  that 's not the reason at all . 
  d'hondt is one of the best systems for seat distribution.it happened because we have electoral threshold of 5 % / 8 % . 
  these are the three biggest parties that failed to get in : united left with 6 % , korwin with almost 5 % and razem ( together ) with 3 % . 
  so that way , over 2 million votes were pretty much thrown away . 
   santa claus yes , we call them both the same but more accurate translation would be saint nicholas . 
  i would think they have some passage beneath them, 
  why is walesa still being brought up as an authority in the media ? 
  can confirm , you sound russian . 
  thanks to the soft consonants , the rhythm and the word stress, 
  i always though algorithm was related to rhythm ( algorytm & rytm in polish ), 
   ( ... ) cross ( ... ) why so intolerant, 
  the us is a federal state , it 's not fair to compare them . 
  yes , national socialists . 
  but this term looks bad now because some guy used `` socialist '' in the name as a populist measure . 
  europe is not overpopulated , its population barely changed since a hundred years ago . 
  looks like we are true neutral, 
  i think pis wants uk to stay , as they and uk 's tories make one party in the ep . 
  and their general foreign policy is a lot more independent that the pervious government , that seemed to think the only foreign entity is the eu, 
  let 's be honest here , even if the crimean referendum was n't a joke , the results would still be the same with crimea at least separating . 
  and an official , national celebrity that enjoys support and respect of the community, 
  why should teacher 's sexuality play a role ? 
  it 's a fucking school,
