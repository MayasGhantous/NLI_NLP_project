https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlm2ygukfcg honestly , i do n't know about slovakia , but it happens regularly in poland already . 
  various groups of hooligans beating the shit out of each other and attacking police , nationalist demolishing warsaw once a year to show how patriotic they are , morons with machetes in krak\u00f3w cutting off each others limbs , demolished trains and city squares , burned cars , beaten up tourists , etc. 
  and ironically those are the people who protest the most against taking in refugees , they want to protect the white man 's civilization from foreign savages - makes me laugh . 
  me too . 
  recently i 've read that following ww2 territorial changes , poland gained a small duchy in silesia , dating back to xiii century when it was part of poland , that somehow now belonged to french aristocrats . 
  france demanded compensation but since communist government had no money , they had to pay for it with coal shipments . 
  they 're citizens of ukraine with polish roots , but without polish citizenship . 
  government gives out ' [ pole 's cards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) ' to such people - they get free visas , work permissions , etc. 
  they do n't have citizenship because sometimes it 's not possible to hold dual citizenship , or they could face repressions in their country . 
  it varies each year . 
  it seems that we were very optimistic in 2012 when results for most nations peaked ( even russians scored 0.10 , only -0.20 for romanians ) . 
  since then it all went down and seems to be going up again now ( although immigration crisis might disrupt that trend ) . 
  danes got 0.51 in 2013 ( compared to 0.60 for swedes  ) . 
  results from 2015 nation | 2014 score | 2015 score | difference -- | -- | -- | -- germans | 0.21 | 0.46 | +0.25 americans | 0.45 | 0.68 | +0.23 japanese | 0.32 | 0.55 | +0.23 english | 0.49 | 0.71 | +0.22 swedes | 0.55 | 0.74 | +0.19 italians | 0.73 | 0.92 | +0.19 chinese | -0.18 | 0.00 | +0.18 greeks | 0.35 | 0.53 | +0.18 lithuanians | 0.18 | 0.35 | +0.17 dutch | 0.55 | 0.70 | +0.15 swiss | 0.57 | 0.71 | +0.14 bulgarians | 0.11 | 0.24 | +0.13 georgians | 0.17 | 0.30 | +0.13 spaniards | 0.73 | 0.86 | +0.13 austrians | 0.46 | 0.58 | +0.12 belgians | 0.49 | 0.61 | +0.12 french | 0.54 | 0.66 | +0.12 hungarians | 0.61 | 0.73 | +0.12 slovaks | 0.69 | 0.80 | +0.11 vietnamese | -0.20 | -0.09 | +0.11 belorussians | -0.03 | 0.06 | +0.09 czechs | 0.72 | 0.80 | +0.08 ukrainians | 0.03 | 0.11 | +0.08 croats | 0.45 | 0.51 | +0.06 estonians | 0.24 | 0.29 | +0.05 turks | -0.29 | -0.24 | +0.05 romanians | -0.52 | -0.49 | +0.03 jews | -0.11 | -0.08 | +0.03 roma | -0.85 | -0.93 | -0.08 irish | 0.70 | 0.66 | -0.04 russians | -0.35 | -0.60 | -0.25 palestinians | | -0.40 | norwegians | 0.67 | | brazilians | 0.53 | | egyptians | 0.05 | |, 
   and the question of this pool probably was : here you have a list of countries , please arrange it from most favorite to less . 
  actually , people were asked to give points from -3 to +3 to each nation , numbers on the map are averages . 
  indeed . 
  windows of that middle house are like 2.5-3m above the ground . 
  that 's a lovely architecture . 
  that 's true , but they look like [ this ] ( http://www.budnet.pl/static/article_images/normal/ogrodzenie%20panelowe%20r-fit%20legi.jpg ) - you can actually see what 's behind them . 
  why are there 2m tall walls everywhere ? 
  what about street lamps ? 
  would have been a good video if it ended at 1:35 . 
  including his speech from jedwabne here is like suggesting that he was drunk at the time and what he said is not true . 
  that 's an ugly manipulation . 
  ha ha , a virus !, 
  that 's exactly the same explanation our former president kwa\u015bniewski used , other time it was something wrong with his leg . 
  looks a bit like [ this minaret ] ( http://www.kresywschodnie.republika.pl/kamieniec/big/dsc05460.jpg ) ottomans build next to cathedral in kamieniec podolski which they occupied during one of the wars with poland . 
  kamieniec podolski was returned but as part of an agreement minaret had to stay . 
  some years later a statue of mary was placed on top of it . 
  the guy with a kid : this is a pole !, 
  he is also a pole !, 
  the fat one with a mic : that 's an interesting polish child , but white catholic polish children get only 125 $ !, 
  people , record this !, 
  watch what is happening !, 
  it 's all clear now !, 
  mason organization tells us that we will pay to this child and this lady here 1000 $ , and how much will polish family with polish child get ? 
  250 $ one time only . 
  we wo n't be cheated , we wo n't allow to steal from us !, 
  enough of this !, 
  enough of anti-polonism , enough of cheering for non-polish children , enough of stealing from polish children , enough of this insolence , enough of this anti-polinism !, 
  no more , the end has come , rule of post-communists , neo-communists will end !, 
  referendum is coming , election is coming and we 'll show them where is a place of anti-poles !, 
  there 's no place for them in warsaw !, 
  there 's no place for equal rights , those are not people of 2nd category , they have no place in poland !, 
  those are anti-poles , people that are against polish nation , they must not manage public money , they must not manage public health care because they 'll murder old people !, 
  you see , your definition of refugee seems to be different than the one our government uses and you spread bs propaganda about poland mercifully taking care of thousands of ukrainians . 
  well i guess all the poles who emigrated are refugees . 
   and it 's not like they are doing jobs that no pole will do , cause that is just a lie . 
  yeah , most of them work in agriculture , on constructions or in other low wage jobs , apart from programmers . 
  it 's actually similar to what poles do on emigration . 
  and i live in central poland , in region specializing in apple production , so i see quite a lot of them , and it 's been like that for years . 
   poland could just deport them , but we practically do n't . 
  why on earth would we do that , while it benefits us ? 
   poland took . 
  refugees my ass , and you make it sound like poland did some tremendous effort taking in thousands of ukrainians . 
  nothing of the sort happened . 
  the facts is that they come here every year to work in low wage jobs that poles do n't want to do . 
  we do n't provide them with housing , health care or any welfare . 
  it benefits us and we pay nothing for it , no effort on our side . 
  recently more of them come because their economy is in shambles , that 's it . 
   hundred of thousands of ukrainian refugees [ yeah , 2 out of ~ 1700 applicants . 
  ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/tylko-dwoch-ukraincow-ze-statusem-uchodzcy,574547.html ) the rest are work immigrants who do n't get any welfare . 
   how convenient . 
  right ? 
  how convenient to spread bs . 
  [ i bet this is what you 're looking for . 
  ] ( https://pl.vichan.net/cp/src/1svbnh1m.vichan.jpg ) - it 's all true . 
  [ why yes , they did !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-0efgvek8 ), 
   they never paid for the total destruction of warsaw for example . 
  they 've paid with their land and all the houses , factories and infrastructure left there so stop it already . 
  as for the second part of your comment - i agree . 
  austrians , czechs and slovaks recently formed something called slavkov triangle . 
  stock exchanges from austria , czechia and hungary form cee stock exchange group . 
  sometimes there are visegrad group meetings in format 4 + 2 : v4 ( czechia , hungary , poland , slovakia ) + austria and slovenia . 
  and to think that [ someone ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100613154703/nonsensopedia/images/c/c2/palikot.jpg ) had this brilliant idea to lower it to 16 . 
  that would 've been fun !, 
  than i see it 's working just as expected ... , 
   we should change ours to `` america the beautiful '' - a much more lovely song i would gladly sing . 
  or to [ america , fuck yeah !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5a0pg4on8 ) , 
  i love the first verse : * poland has not yet perished , so long as we still live * the rest does n't resonate with me as it 's kinda militaristic and outdated - from the time of napoleon - about how we 're going to set poland free and take back what 's ours ... with a sabre . 
  feels awkward . 
  at least the tune is nice and uplifting . 
  do n't mind him , elections are coming and he wants to gather votes of radical , anti-system teenagers . 
  actually it 's samogitia or lower lithuania as the name lithuania rightfully belongs to belarus , right ? 
  [ somebody that you used to know ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uvnt4wvigy ) , 
  your attitude towards a nation . 
  nation | positive | neutral | negative | hard to say -- | -- | -- | -- | -- ukrainians | 36 | 26 | 32 | 6 [ stosunek do innych narod\u00f3w 2015 cbos ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2015/k_014_15.pdf ) - and it hugely improved after 2004 . 
  poland was considered ` the most cheerful barrack in the communist camp ' as our censorship allowed more . 
  the concert is from opole festival ' 83 , one of two biggest mainstream festivals at the time . 
  he 's singing about how he used to have so many friends and fellow fighters around him and now suddenly they all disappeared , and then he sees them all , with their new jobs , paying taxes and marching with white flags . 
  it is about how solidarity movement got pacified after introduction of martial law in 1981 . 
  we did n't do that out of sympathy ( ukraine is not high on our favourite countries list ) , we did that because it 's in our interest to have strong , independent and friendly countries between us and russia . 
  [ republika - bia\u0142a flaga ( white flag ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcztheqy4e4 ) grzegorz ciechowski with an awesome haircut . 
  russia proposed it ( yamal 2 ) , but poland did n't agree to a new pipe ( precisely because it would bypass ukraine ) . 
  it 's in poland 's interest not to have over 1000 km long border with ussr 2.0 . 
  projects such as nord stream undermine safety of eastern europe , and trust that eastern europeans have in germany .
