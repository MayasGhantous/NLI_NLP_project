  he was making fun of your ridiculous conspiracy theories . 
  slavs do n't equal poles , those are sorbs . 
  poles living in germany are immigrants . 
  germans in silesia are native population , kinda - at least their presence there predates current polish population . 
   although they withdrawn all claims long time ago so did poland . 
  150k is a small fraction of prewar population , i would n't call it substantial . 
   they even get two seats in our parliament by law . 
  wrong , they do n't have to reach 5 % to get to the parliament , like other parties . 
  currently they have 1 seat . 
   a dystopic wasteland in east poland eastern poland is far from being [ a dystopic wasteland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1u_xbs-pvk ) . 
  if i were to point a place in poland that is dystopic , it would be one of the mining towns in silesia region , southwestern poland , with 20 % + unemployment , full of drunks , emigrating youth , buildings falling apart . 
   ok as far as economic development goes yeah , the part of poland that austria occupied - galicia and lodomeria - became known as golicja i g\u0142odomoria - roughly translated as land of naked and starving . 
  invaded by right wing poles . 
  general persecutor is appointed by the president . 
  current one was appointed by president kaczy\u0144ski , so you are wrong . 
  whether or not we 're observing a political battle is secondary to the fact that he stole public money ( and wo n't be punished , same as sikorski before him ) . 
  little gain and tarnished reputation . 
  our pm is in a similar situation . 
  it 's good that media are talking about it , but i 'm afraid they both will avoid responsibility . 
  until fairly recently bicycles were used mostly by kids and old villagers who for some reason do n't have a car . 
  we used to hear things like : `` warsaw is not a village to ride a bicycle here '' from city council not so long ago . 
  fortunately situation is improving immensely the last few years . 
  cycling is gaining popularity and there are more and more bike lanes . 
  but poland , like all of eastern europe , has a strong car culture so cyclists receive a lot of hate from drivers . 
  lithuanians are majority in [ pu\u0144sk / punskas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gmina_pu%c5%84sk ) - about 75 % which would be about 3200 people . 
  to be honest i do n't understand why those villages are in poland - it 's a small stripe of land directly at the border , would n't hurt us to give it to lithuania . 
  as for sejny/seiniai , lithuanian population is only 7 % there , and 18 % of population of surrounding villages . 
   of topic . 
  i wonder though , do people living in north , north eastern poland are interested in it 's baltic past . 
  for example , there are no curonians left , but we still try to reconstruct their culture . 
  sure , for example : http://www.mazury.com.pl/hotele/galindia/index.htm ( it 's in polish but there are photos ) . 
  now you do n't like it , but guess who promoted it in the first place . 
   the first pan-slav congress was held in prague , bohemia in june , 1848 , during the revolutionary movement of 1848 . 
  [ ... ] most of the delegates were czech . 
   english | slovak | czech | polish -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ camel | \u0165ava | ** velbloud ** | ** wielb\u0142\u0105d ** stork | ** bocian ** | \u010d\u00e1p | ** bocian ** if | \u010di | ** jestli ** | ** je\u015bli ** icicle | cenc\u00fa\u013e | rampuch | sopel now | ** teraz ** | nyn\u00ed | ** teraz ** cemetery | cintor\u00edn | h\u0159bitov | cmentarz trousers | nohavice | kalhoty | spodnie * breakfast | ra\u0148ajky | ** sn\u00eddan\u011b ** | ** \u015bniadanie ** thirst | sm\u00e4d | \u017e\u00edze\u0148 | pragnienie cabbage | ** kapusta ** | zel\u00ed | ** kapusta ** * - we have word like * nogawice * and * galoty * but they have slightly different meanings and * ra\u0148ajky * is a really nice word for breakfast . 
  some polish marches : [ marsz generalski ( general 's march ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx2ti9oinsa ) [ warszawianka ( la varsovienne ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpgfl4evfnw ) [ my , pierwsza brygada ( we , the first brigade ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zslep4m1fro ) [ szara piechota ( grey infantry ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t815v9viqeu ), 
  there even was a joke about that trade - stalin says : we will take from you your coal , and in return you will give us your grain . 
  i like french and greek the most . 
  maybe you 're right , but russia is still one of their main trade partners . 
   estonia , belarus and ukraine their economies would collapse together with russia . 
  i do n't feel bad or inferior , i just do n't like megalomania . 
  i do n't know , judging from your comment ... 
  there are many delusional poles . 
  right ... ** france : ** * gdp - 2,846,889 * population - 66 and growing * g8 member , eurozone member , eu founder , united nations security council member , nuclear power , military power , one of the most technologically advanced nations , etc. 
  ** poland ** : * gdp - 546,644 * population - 38 and shrinking * still poor , backwards , with little influence not in the same league . 
  [ it 's already happening i see .

  [ europeanized ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yn9koil.jpg ) version is so much better , 
  * nukes - during communism we tried to secretly develop our own nukes , but soviets probably found out about it and our main scientist had an accident ... project was canceled . 
  we never had one , but that does n't mean we did n't try . 
  in xvii duke of courland , at the time fief of poland-lithuania , wanted to expand fleet , trade with india and colonize africa , but polish king was not interested , instead preparing for war against turkey . 
  so duke colonized gambia and tobago by himself . 
  then in xix one of polish nobles organized expedition and established a settlement in cameroon , but poland at the time was under occupation so he did n't get any support and cameroon soon became a german colony . 
  after ww1 , idea of possessing colonies gained a lot of support from both the society and the government - it was seen as both prestigious and economically beneficial . 
  as a result [ maritime and colonial league ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/c683ec507829dc4e5e74137c3b5726ec,641,0,0,0.jpg ) was established . 
  1930s : [ we demand overseas colonies for poland ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/1b4f33bd9fecea8040f5a183546ab62a,640,0,0,0.jpg ) [ strength of poland lies in colonies ] ( http://historia.focus.pl/upload/galleries/2/manifestacja-czlonkow-ligi-morskiej-i-2000_l.jpg ) [ africa - source of natural resources ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/09bde0ec247b6d8dbab6a4714bd29654,641,0,0,0.jpg ) [ 1938 colonial days , maritime and colonial league demands overseas colonies for poland ] ( http://m.natemat.pl/eeaa08da3e4024dd46f186d7653b6417,641,0,0,0.jpg ) there were some attempts to colonize parts of liberia , angola , brazil and peru , but they all failed . 
  in late 1930s poland wanted to buy madagascar from france and resettle there polish jews . 
  [ the idea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) gained some support in britain and france and was later revived by nazi germany . 
  these days targets for our overseas territories are - iceland , ireland and britain .

  i would identify `` some people '' with swedish and polish politicians who invented [ eastern partnership ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_partnership ) and put ukrainians on  their natural eu path, 
   `` radek '' sikorski off-topic but i 've seen you do that before , do you also write `` tony '' blair and `` bill '' clinton ? 
   some black people do n't like that term for some reason and the reason is pretty clear - `` murzyn '' in polish is equivalent to * negro * in english and most people think of it as a neutral word , but they often forget about it 's negative connotations . 
  for example , some polish proverbs :  a u was bij\u0105 murzyn\u00f3w . 
  * and in your land , you beat negros . 
  * - used to point out whataboutism . 
  * one hundred years behind negros . 
  * - to emphasise that something is really backwards or someone is very poor . 
  * it 's dark like in an ass of a negro . 
  * - when it 's so dark you ca n't see a thing . 
  * to do for a negro . 
  * - to be exploited by someone . 
  and one more example , by our former minister of foreign affairs :  problem w polsce jest , \u017ce mamy p\u0142ytk\u0105 dum\u0119 i nisk\u0105 ocen\u0119 . 
  taka murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 * the problem in poland is that we have shallow pride and low self esteem . 
  a kind of negritude . 
  * - from secret recordings , referring to polish - american diplomatic relations . 
  we were n't happy . 
  for us it meant the end of duchy of warsaw and hopes of restoring poland . 
  there are busts of napoleon in many places in poland . 
  many poles do n't know much about romania and they often mistakenly identify roma with romania . 
  the result is romanians are amongst the most disliked nations in poland . 
  below you can see top 5 disliked nations from a survey done in 2015 . 
  full results , in polish , in the link below . 
   how would you describe your relation to other nations ? 
  nation | sympathy | neutral | dislike | hard to tell -- | -- | -- | -- | -- turks | 23 | 29 | 36 | 12 russians | 22 | 23 | 50 | 5 romanians | 21 | 26 | 43 | 10 palestinians | 20 | 27 | 36 | 17 roma | 18 | 18 | 58 | 6 source : http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2015/k_014_15.pdf, 
   those industries produced inferior goods absolutely , no arguing with that . 
  but at least some of the products were cheaper and had valuable brands . 
  factories had valuable assets and potential to be modernized and kept relevant , had we protected our market . 
  or at least we could have sold them at a fair price . 
   , it was either that or bankruptcy . 
  it was that and bankruptcy . 
  most of the factories that we sold for pennies , hoping for modernization and keeping jobs , were closed shortly after . 
  assets were transferred to the west , and ` investor ' was left with land and no local competition . 
  we let western companies make fortunes on us . 
  i write about this only to make a point that we do n't only ` suck up eu benefits like a sponge ' . 
  for a time poland was a sponge that was being squeezed hard . 
   it does however not mean that polish politicians should try to meddle in british politics . 
  i agree with that . 
   the ecj has also in a verdict made clear that member-states have the right to deny benefits to nationals from other member-states . 
  really ?
