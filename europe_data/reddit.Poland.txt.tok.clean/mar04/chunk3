  if they 're paying taxes there ? 
  that would n't be fair . 
  in my opinion member state should have a right to deny any benefits to unemployed immigrants , and even throw out unwanted immigrants that are homeless , beggars or criminals . 
  but if an immigrant is paying taxes he deserve to be treated equally . 
  poland sold most of state owned companies to western capital for nothing , completely opened it 's market to competition with companies from developed western countries effectively giving them 40 million consumers of western goods and services while killing local producers that were unable to compete - you think this is nothing ? 
  we have no brands , little capital , little own industry , high unemployment and we become the low wage workforce of europe . 
  that was the cost of cancelling debts of our communist country , helping us modernize and accepting us into eu and nato . 
  they are not anti-democratic ? 
  constantly questioning results of elections because they did n't win , insinuating forgery and conspiracies . 
  questioning independence of courts , because some verdicts were against them . 
  using president to obstruct what the government does , when it 's not their government . 
  showing disrespect to the president by calling him the man `` who got elected by mistake '' . 
  boycotting council of national security , because of personal animosities . 
  boycotting speeches and debates with the minister of foreign affairs , because they do n't like him . 
  voting against nominating a mp deputy speaker of parliament , because her party was too liberal . 
  calling for orban style authoritarian democracy . 
  naming voters of other parties ` not a true poles ' or ` hidden german supporters ' . 
  calling other politicians ` degenerates ' or ` foreign powers servants ' . 
  abusing power and using secret services to spy on journalist and other politicians . 
  protecting hooligans , because they are ` true patriots ' . 
  personally , i 'm sick of the ruling party , but i would never vote for pis , because they 're even more incompetent and their vision of poland is repulsive to me . 
  because , as i wrote above , it 's rarely used . 
  usually in historical/geographical context . 
  but i made a simple test with google search for * niderlandy - kr\u00f3lestwo - kr\u00f3lestwa * and * kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w * , and the former actually has more results , although both are marginal when compared to google search for * holandia * . 
  other , rarely used name is niderlandy . 
   a government that ruled over my people the lizard men , jewish nwo or the martians ? 
  and i bet nazis were n't germans but zombies . 
   so why are there poles living in the cities built by germans ? 
  because they were thrown out of their own cities - lw\u00f3w , grodno , wilno . 
  you thinks that any pole would have switched lw\u00f3w for breslau or wilno for stettin ? 
  you want to blame someone , blame your own people for starting the war . 
  poland was n't after lebensraum . 
  postwar warsaw is just an ugly city with few tourist attractions . 
  on the one hand you have small reconstruction of historical , beautiful old town that gives you an idea what an amazing city it once was and on the other you have ugly commie buildings everywhere mixed with remnants of old townhouses and kitschy office buildings and skyscrapers . 
  there are literally highways going right through the middle of the city ( commie idea of urbanization ) and empty fields everywhere . 
  just have a look at [ that ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=124117166&amp;postcount=12136 ) . 
   that is the true russian nature , they want to be the people in charge of their own land there is just one problem with that - they just do n't know where ` their land ' ends , 
    they are simply work immigrants . 
   so are the africans . 
  than there 's a problem with giving africans asylum , not with refusing it to ukrainians . 
  ukrainians get work visas as they should . 
   nearly all conflicts involve a certain area of a country , and not the entire country . 
  that has never been an excuse . 
  conflict in donbas is very isolated . 
  ukraine has a normal , stable government that can handle their own refugees and there is no risk of them being killed , tortured or oppressed by anyone . 
  why should we grant them refugee status ? 
  they are simply work immigrants . 
  the conflict zone is just a small area in second largest country in europe . 
  is this for real ? 
  please , tell me it 's photoshoped . 
  neighboring region is sparsely populated and rather poor , because it 's mostly forests and lakes . 
  there is a difference between gazeta.pl and wyborcza.pl . 
  prokofiev : [ dance of the knights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dumq1cpcglq ) vivaldi : [ winter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-usab530a ) grieg : [ in the hall of mountain king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xriyt-mrvai ) saint-sa\u00ebns : [ danse macabre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyknbtm_yym ) chopin : [ raindrop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ofhxmizp38 ) and more of satie : [ gnossienne no. 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfvgwgqcb0 ), 
  of the two candidates in the second round , he certainly is the more conservative one . 
  as for the eu , his party sides with british conservatives , they are outsiders , wanting weak eu - the opposite of palikot who is for federalization . 
  sure , so in the first round you vote for the most liberal , most pro-eu candidate and in the second round you vote for the most conservative , most anti-eu candidate . 
  wow , that 's some delusional stuff . 
  first , war in georgia was none of our business , what he did was realizing american interests . 
  second , kaczy\u0144ski gathered a bunch of irrelevant politicians and went to georgia , defying polish foreign policy , acting against the government - he should have been put in front of state tribunal for that . 
  third , he did n't achieve anything besides making a fool of himself . 
  meanwhile real talks took place between paris , berlin and moscow . 
  anyone who thinks that our country can make politics against all the big players in europe is delusional . 
  so much logic in that . 
  if you 're talking about east prussia , than it was clear to all allies that german exclave could provoke another war in the future , and they all agreed to give that land to poland . 
  than stalin changed his mind and it was divided between lithuania , russia and poland . 
  no one even considered it an option to leave east prussia as part of germany . 
  no one really wants it to pass . 
  it 's just a way to eliminate kukiz from autumn parliamentary elections , because that guy has literally no other propositions other than fptp . 
  it 's the same thing that cameron did to ukip by promising eu referendum . 
  same thing in warsaw : [ two women thrown out of starbucks .

  * demographic catastrophe - very low fertility rate ( ~ 1.3 ) coupled with big emigration * brain drain - we 're lacking doctors and other specialists who are emigrating to the western europe * education - too few engineers , too many historians and sociologists , also everyone and their dog wants higher education * unemployment - officially around 10 % , lower in reality - grey area , problems with collecting taxes * overblown bureaucracy and a horrible and hostile fiscal law * corruption - dramatic improvement compared to '90s but it 's still a big issue * air pollution - we 're one of the most polluted countries in europe ; wroc\u0142aw , krak\u00f3w , warszawa , silesia - smog * low electricity generation - in few years shortages of electricity are expected in some areas of the country * infrastructure - rapidly improving , but it will take at least 10-15 years to catch up to the western europe with motorways and many decades when it comes to railway * low level of urbanization , fragmentation of farms , no spatial planning , underdevelopment of some eastern regions of the country * football hooligans and increased activity of far right movements * foreign policy - can we trust our nato allies ? 
  what do we get for giving usa a blowjob ? 
  should we continue antagonizing russia ? 
  should we keep supporting ukraine overlooking their faults ? 
  * state of the army - we 're still using lots of soviet equipment that needs replacing , overblown officer corps , is our army big enough and can it protect us * secular state - catholic church still has a very big influence on many spheres of our life and on our political class * in vitro , abortion , same sex relationships , gender ideology - a crusade by the church and conservative politicians , mostly spreading fear and misinformation * euro - there is some debate on entering the eurozone , from time to time, 
   they decided to meddle with neighboring countries instead of developing industries and scientific research ca n't disagree with that . 
  than it 's disappointing , if that 's the case . 
  thanks for a broader view . 
  i think that 20 years ago they were pretty busy keeping their country from disintegrating . 
  '90s were tough in eastern europe . 
  or maybe it 's a decent starting point . 
  i would give russians a benefit of a doubt . 
  sure , they 're years behind , but they 've got smart people and are willing to compete . 
  that 's a good news . 
  the more competition , the better . 
  i meant it as : britain is the voice of reason . 
  whether eu membership is good for britain is for you to decide . 
   britain 's home office said the plans were unacceptable and that efforts should focus on stopping people traffickers . 
   `` the uk has a proud history of offering asylum to those who need it most , but we do not believe that a mandatory system of resettlement is the answer , '' a home office spokesman said . 
   `` we will oppose any eu commission proposals to introduce a non-voluntary quota . '', 
  that 's why we need britain in eu . 
  who is the most liked ? 
  well , our infrastructure is in a very bad shape . 
  basically we were n't building new tracks for the last 40 years , and the existing ones seen little to no maintenance . 
  so most of the trains are forced to ride slowly and tend to be late . 
  and we 've got the highest number of accidents in the eu . 
  things are supposed to get better in the coming years though . 
  unfortunately our railways are terrible . 
  it does .
