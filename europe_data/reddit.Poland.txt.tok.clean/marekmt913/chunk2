  you ca n't build a decent economy by being a colony for foreign corporations ... 
   is n't the polish economy like on the top of their game or something right now ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  yeah , i do n't think there is a specific term for black people born and raised in poland ( usually they 're not born here  and usually they have children from mixed black-white marriages ) . 
  the general terms for black people are ` murzyn ' ( originally meaning ` black african ' ) and ` czarny ' ( ` black ' ) . 
  politically correct media will use ` czarnosk\u00f3ry ' ( ` black-skinned ' ) despite the fact that the other two words are not in any way pejorative . 
  for black people living in africa we also use ` afryka\u0144czyk ' ( ` african ' ) . 
  as / u/jedrekk said , i would also add 1944 , and i think that 1525 and 1981 are also pretty recognisable dates . 
  the same in poland . 
  i think bernie is the only rational candidate . 
  any other choice ( especially trump ) would be pretty much a catastrophe . 
  in polish we sometimes ( very rarely ) use the word * jankes * to refer to americans in general ( without north/south distinction ) , but it 's used mainly in a rather joking/depreciating manner . 
  wow , that 's bizarre because communism is supposed to be internationalist . 
  i think it 's rather characteristic of russia . 
  polish nationalists are essentially fascists and anti-leftist . 
  mixed how ? 
  never heard of it . 
  nationalists here hate communism , socialism and anything leftist . 
  they most often do n't know what these things mean but they sure hate them . 
  i suppose that 's the case in most eu countries , but unfortunately not in poland [ edit : i meant medical kit here ] . 
  i do n't think history has anything to do here . 
  if it did , we would n't emigrate to germany , 
  firs of all , language . 
  it 's self-explanatory . 
  english is much more popular than german , french , dutch or norwegian . 
  second thing , much higher wages . 
  most common wage in poland oscillates around 350 pounds/month and many people earn less and there 's basically no social security , so it gives you the idea . 
  then other factors like : less stressful life ( a bit slower i would say , more relaxed ) , good social security , more respect from people ( people are more cheerful and helpful and do n't treat each other like shit , i suppose ) , less exploitation etc. 
  well , poland is generally a pretty shitty country if you ask me , so you may complain about the uk as much as you like , but we know it 's still much better than poland , haha :p, 
  no , i do n't really think so . 
  at least i 've never heard of any `` slavic brotherhood '' . 
  i think that poles rather tend to look down on other slavs . 
  shortly speaking : no way . 
  nope . 
  i really like this song  and his words reflect exactly the situation of many people in poland , and the worst part is that there is no prospect of improvement . 
  i really hate it when the government celebrate the partially free elections of 1989 and they say that now we have ` freedom ' . 
  i say fuck this kind of freedom . 
  after 26 years of it i would expect much much better progress . 
  i would really argue if corporate oppression is better than soviet oppression . 
  hi , a pole here . 
  as i 'm too young i also ca n't speak from my own perspective , but i 'll try to tell you about my parents ' and grandparents ' experience . 
  i come from quite an average and ordinary family . 
  we 've never had any political affiliations or connections in the communist party . 
  my grandparents were born in the 1930s . 
  grandmothers - in rural central poland . 
  grandfathers - in rural eastern poland [ nowadays belarus and ukraine ] and they were later relocated to the [ recovered territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) in the west . 
  as kids they had lived through german and russian occupation , so as you can imagine anything that came after the war must have been better for them . 
  of course they had free education and healthcare  this generation literally built this country , lifted it from ruins , and did it with enthusiasm and optimism trying to lead normal lives . 
  in the 1950s my grandparents had the opportunity to move to warsaw which was being raised from the ashes . 
  they got very cheap housing and started their own families . 
  they had pretty decent jobs . 
  of course they were aware that there were many problems in the country and they knew to some extent that in western europe there were much better living conditions but they tried not to make a big deal about it . 
  from 1945 to 1973 poland probably did the biggest leap in social development in its history , and no one would have thought that ` communism ' will fall . 
  in 1989 my family were probably quite enthusiastic about the transformation but nowadays , as things in poland have been going in the very wrong direction , they got more nostalgic for the old times . 
  my parents ( born 1960 ) had quite carefree childhood and youth . 
  unlike many people from their generation they were fortunate enough to have never faced unemployment . 
  but having to put up with absurdity of contemporary poland , they are probably even more nostalgic for the old times than my grandparents . 
  now for your other questions : very few people have capitalised on the transition ( mainly apparatchiks and former [ security service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c5%82u%c5%bcba_bezpiecze%c5%84stwa ) employees ) and for most people it was quite painful . 
  our ` elites ' have been obsessed with neoconservatism/neoliberalism , milton friedman , reagan and thatcher , so they let foreign corporations and some shady ` businessmen ' senselessly rob our national wealth . 
  privatisation has been a one huge scandal . 
  our industry has been essentially ruined . 
  many people faced unemployment for the first time in their lives . 
  social inequalities , costs of living , exploitation , poverty and homelessness have skyrocketed . 
  at least during ` communism ' employers were abiding the law , and from what i 've heard there was much better work-life balance . 
  since we joined the eu in 2004 2,5 million people emigrated to western europe and 70 % of the young people ( including me ) intend to emigrate due to unemployment , slave wages , and lack of perspectives for decent life here . 
  unfortunately , due to relentless government right-wing anti-socialist propaganda , many people see socialism as pure evil and humbly endure unforgiving conditions in poland which governments call ` freedom ' . 
  many young people know next to nothing about [ prl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people%27s_republic ) and if they do , they focus on bad things while ignoring obvious achievements of that era . 
  probably there is much more to tell about it . 
  feel free to ask if you have any further questions . 
  i really doubt it . 
  in what way it might be similar ? 
  but even if it 's similar , it does n't make it a part of europe ... 
  nope . 
  it 's in asia . 
  nah , never heard such opinions . 
  if anything it might apply only to food . 
  we really like polish food . 
  but for any other products the general opinion is that western ( especially german ) is better . 
  we have : * in nominative : * dwa * [ m. / n. 
  ] , * dwie * [ f. ] * in instrumental : * dwoma * [ m. / n. 
  ] , * dwiema * [ f. ] i also looked it up and found out that both * dwoma/dwiema * are correct for feminine , although * dwiema * is more popular ( or rather was because i hear * dwoma * all the time ) and highly recommended . 
  i read that * dwiema * is actually a descendant from the proto-slavic language and this form was the only one in the medieval polish , later to be replaced by * dwoma * in masculine and neutrum and now it 's happening in feminine as well . 
  so that 's a nice example of language evolution . 
  slovaks also mess up `` two '' ? 
  it 's funny because i noticed that for some strange reason polish people also do this , which is a little annoying for me . 
  they very often use masculine form instead of feminine in the * instrumentalis ( narz\u0119dnik ) * case . 
  ( i was there with [ my ] two [ female ] friends ) . 
  i do n't know what 's the cause of this mistake . 
  polish native here . 
  no , we never mix it up . 
  maybe unless someone hears an extremely rare word for the first time and is not so sure about the declension pattern ( which we use unconsciously by the way ; unless you 're a linguist , you wo n't know what it is ) . 
  but this hardly ever happens . 
  and it 's easier than in german because we do n't have to memorise definite articles [ der , die , das ] , we recognise the gender by the word ending . 
  that 's a valid point indeed . 
  right wheel drive would be inconvenient outside of the uk . 
  i think / u/annakaren meant the whole eu , not only western europe . 
  for example you will need only one schengen area visa and there are no border controls , so you can cross the borders without even stopping your car . 
  as far as i know , you should n't have any problems with your driving licence . 
  and i think , as you said , probably it would be easier for you to get a car in the uk . 
  cars are somewhat cheaper there and you can get an insurance very quickly and conveniently , without the language barrier
