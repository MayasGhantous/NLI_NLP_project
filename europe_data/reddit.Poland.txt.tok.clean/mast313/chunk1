that 's nice , but reading this pdf would take me weeks . 
  could you politely quote the part that denies that what i sayed ? 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/802dqaig0ws?t=121 ) is reference to [ this ] ( http://hetalia.kitawiki.net/index.php?title=lithuania ) . 
  hetalia describes polish-lithuanian relations as best as possible . 
  edit : [ for example this one ] ( http://gogoanime.io/hetalia-world-series-episode-44 ) , but if you do n't want to get anime-shocked stop watching at 3:00 . 
  yeah but there is reference to anime so nobody takes it seriously . 
   like somewhat still not so bad but it probably changed since then . 
  : / thanks . 
  poles mostly are n't really interested in history of lithuania , so it 's more like `` knows '' than `` understands '' . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ got ^ ^ interested ^ ^ in ^ ^ it ^ ^ because ^ ^ of ^ ^ hetalia ... 
  but lithuania was going to be completely separate country , not commonwealth , not roughly ethnic borders but two countries . 
  lithuanians did n't want to to have something in common with poles . 
  they got independence from russia and they hoped to keep it . 
  pi\u0142sudski should try to convince lithuania the diplomatic way , not annex it 's capital . 
  constantinople was turkish for long time . 
  right , you got this one . 
  the good guys always remain shy so you do n't notice them , and the `` bunch of assholes '' makes most mess . 
  i think that you should n't generalize whole minority . 
  if i will see one i will mention about him . 
  no it 's like discussion if house is still my when my tenant started to rule there . 
   nationalist lithuania , who wanted to eradicate any polish influence ... because poland tried to make lithuanians living there , poles ? 
   but what poland did then was the most logical solution logical solution ? 
  it should try to be lithuanian ally again instead of attacking it !, 
   giving vilnius to lithuania in 1920 would be comparable to giving constantinople back to greece . 
  no that one is totally different . 
  something positive ? 
  the amount of polish nationalists is so height only in internet . 
  in [ questionnaire about polish relations to other nations ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2015/k_014_15.pdf ) we gave you 34 like 33 neutral 22 bad and 11 hard to describe . 
  that means that majority of poles likes you . 
  by the way can you find lithuanian questionnaire about that ( if there is any ) ? 
  shitstorm helps every thread to escalate and polish nationalist + thread about vilnius = great shitstorm . 
   between february 8 and 15 , 1919 , lithuanian and german volunteers stopped the soviet advance and prevented them from taking kaunas , ** the temporary ** capital of lithuania . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_soviet_socialist_republic_ ( 1918 % e2 % 80 % 9319 )  people that does n't want to be part of their new country and lived here forever not forever but for very long , not new but reincarnation of old one . 
  vilnius was nearly always capital of lithuania so did they want or not , this city has to be part of lithuania . 
  poland used trick to annex it and lithuania has every right to take it back . 
   lithuanian ultra-nationalists you are the nationalist here . 
   historical facts facts ? 
  stop this shit now !, 
   they occupied the city with soviets lithuanians occupied their own capital !, 
  they just took back what pi\u0142sudski annexed . 
  really you wrote shit here . 
  next time just search for information before posting something . 
  can anyone translate it ? 
   italy so weak totalynothetalia ^ totalynothetalia ^ totalynothetalia, 
  at [ 1:37 ] ( https://youtu.be/pk9gftvw5tm?t=97 ) there is poland and at next second poland do n't exist . 
  it 's back again !, 
  magic ... , 
  i did n't find any other prove that lithuanians do n't like polish like hetalia described , so i used this one . 
  i did n't like to make it look that only poles ( more exactly polish nationalists ) have something against lithuanians . 
  hetalia is really informative ( if you understand these hard references ) , but this one is completely fake especially if you know that lithuania is getting away from poland . 
  yup [ polish jokes ] ( http://www.hetarchive.net/scanlations/comicdiary.php?nikkimannga6 ) . 
  i like hetalia for funny references and facts , but sometimes it seems like this guy do n't know anything about relations of countries . 
  :p easy example that i know . 
  [ poland had a questionnaire on `` other countries according to affection and aversion '' ... 
  but as for why lithuania and the other baltic states were not in the rankings , perhaps it felt like they were already like family , and so were n't considered . 
  ] ( http://www.hetarchive.net/scanlations/comicdiary.php?nikkimanga9 ) so not really ... [ `` lithuanian bastard , get on your knees in front of polish lord '' . 
  ] ( http://zw.lt/assets/img-20130808-00683.jpg ) [ `` what poles think about other nations '' . 
  `` litwini '' means lithuanians . 
  ] ( http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2015/k_014_15.pdf ) [ lithuanians also do n't have good opinion about poles , but it 's more because of nationalists and tomaszewski ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgfb5wbep_y ) edit : [ i also found `` hetalia '' reference that i do n't do n't really know what to think about . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/802dqaig0ws?t=121 ), 
  in poland white rutheania that is often mistaken with white russia . 
  earlier it was called [ black rutheania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_ruthenia ) . 
  [ strange in suwa\u0142ki / suvalkai it looks normal .

  yeah it 's running out of money from centuries . 
  [ did you mean constantinople ? 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/1/15/byzantine_soldier_concept_image_acr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111120195740 ), 
   i guess nothing really important or noteworthy happened to lithuania as a state in-between those events . 
  so lithuania got plundered , made new enemy that annexed it few times ( russia ) , defeated and vassalized its main enemy ( teutonic order/prussia ) . 
   as for 1920 , it also was n't a country-wide thing , you only annexed a part of our country , not all of it . 
  yes , but we did it just after you gained independence , so it was some kind of backstab . 
   it would n't be best to vilify you , we have to forgive and forget if we want to maintain good relations now and in the future . 
  it would n't be vilification , just historical fact . 
  i think that it should be treated like fact of nazi times in germany - we did it but we are sorry . 
  after all we still did n't apologize , but i think that 2020 will be good moment for that . 
  why the most part with poland was just skipped ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ union ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ poland ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ something ^ ^ ^ good , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ ^ suprised ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ mention ^ ^ ^ 1920 . 
  it sounds somehow similar to french for me . 
  ** warning screaming youtuber ** [ anal probe ] ( https://youtu.be/1ykozrjm5e8?list=plbcf43cc8a1a297e1&amp;t=491 ) ? 
  i do n't know , why should they do it . 
  is it some kind of ultimatum to make us treat equally all citizens of europe or what ? 
   remember when we had one king ? 
  from lithuanian point it 's noting really good . 
  the only reason i find is that you are at most ugly . 
  if we would have football fans like they have ... 
  america is n't good , becouse it made mess in some countries .
