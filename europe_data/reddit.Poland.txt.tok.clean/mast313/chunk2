  russia just have it 's policy - annex every weak neighbor that is n't protected by nato before it will be . 
  yes i feel that media are making everything against russia . 
  for example `` panama papers '' in our news . 
   ... many politicans and businessmens were involved in it . 
  for example putin ( it 's not like we hate him , and we wish him to die in pain , that 's just an exemple ... ) but after all russia is harassed and is harassing other nations so we have some reasons to ~ ~ hate ~ ~ not really like it . 
  if [ gpd of latvia is 31 bilions ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/country/latvia ) so it 's losing very much . 
  there is a main difference . 
  we can be crybabies , russia ca n't . 
  [ so otherwise . 
  ] ( https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=https%3a%2f%2fsendvid.com%2f ) but yeah it sounds funny . 
   edit : [ i found the video . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/tvobuht7kpw?t=28 ) turn on subtitles , `` oh my sweet so much add '' . 
  i do n't know , it 's just online video player . 
  i found it as second link in google , so it ca n't be so dangerous . 
  [ but they have big army ] ( http://www.sealandgov.org/title-pack/knight ) it 's more military personel per square meter than in any other country . 
   ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ hard ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ bombard ^ ^ ^ it . 
  [ poor sealand .

  the only safe place is sealand . 
  no patato , no germanization . 
  such is life ... [ but it seems that you were germanized but some time later . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania_minor#germanization ) yeah they did n't germanizated you by force , but we did n't as well . 
   or not do anything at all since it lives only 74 days . 
  no one can save them ... 
  great amount of minitory , makes the minitory get out of control . 
  irrevelant ? 
  nope !, 
  yup , germanization and rusification are much better than polonization . 
  it 's funny to hear that hre was occupied by little nation that was nearly exterminated by teutonic order . 
  i know that you talk about prussians as people from prussia , but it 's still funny . 
  oh yeah so it 's why i sayed that it 's ** also ** polish name ( german , scandinavian , czech , slovak , polish , slovene , croatian , lithuanian , latvian , hungarian name too ) . 
  so thanks that 's true . 
  there was no chance to `` legally '' return before stalins death . 
  and it 's nice that you carry about their graves . 
  so why did they freed her ? 
  as far as i know most of people send to siberia , stayed there until death/escape . 
  by the way `` monika '' is also polish name . 
  ... he will make suicide after saying something wrong about russia ? 
  hey he is political clown and he is n't arleady in poland ? 
  get him here !, 
  now !, 
  so even if lithuanians do n't discriminate russians , listening to tales about that how russians were bad , and how much you are against russian policy makes them feel bad . 
  we do n't hate russians ( maybe some of them ) , we hates russia . 
   i do not know of a single case when working in kolkhoz was chosen as a form of punishment . 
  it was n't punishment for crime but just like : `` we won , we will do with you everything we want , that means make you work until death . '', 
  so it 's the same with savchenko , she ( as i guess ) did n't any crime , but just got defeated . 
  21 maja 1947 roku centralny komitet sowieckiej partii przyj\u0105\u0142 tajne postanowienie \u201e o tworzeniu ko\u0142choz\u00f3w w republikach ba\u0142tyckich '' ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sybiracy )  june 14 , 1941 in the night began the soviet action against the population of the occupied lithuania . 
  in the first week it deported about 30 thousand people . 
  in the years 1941-1952 soviets deported from the country about 132 thousand people 28 thousand got killed . 
  ] ( http://sciesielski.republika.pl/sov-dep/polacy/syberia.html )  in at most little better , and often in worse conditions were deportees , mostly from spring 1941 , who were sent to collective farms and state farms .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2vpece/baltics_rpg/ ), 
  give it up . 
  we need to accept the only real truth . 
  we are pro ~ ~ american ~ ~ american unmoral nazi that deams all days about destroying the great mother russia and opressing hard working hard workers for our degenerated wishes . 
  i 'm also nazi , but look i admitted to it . 
  you can also do it , the great mother russia will even think about forgiving you ... ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ fu ** ^ ^ ^ obama .

  yeah it can make shitstorm even here . 
   i asked becouse i ca n't find any informations about it , and this topic is interesting for me . 
  i hoped that your grandfather sayed you something about it ... edit : [ the only thing i found is this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_relations_during_world_war_ii )  in total , the number of victims of polish revenge actions at the end of june 1944 in dubingiai and neighbouring towns of joni\u0161kis , inturk\u0117 , bijuti\u0161kis , and giedrai\u010diai , was 70 -- 100 lithuanians , including many civilians . 
  massacre at dubingiai was the only known massacre carried out by units of ak . 
  yeah great name for side about cream . 
   i googled the first link and it was working earlier . 
  but the most satisfacting thing there ( in video ) is the shitstorm .
