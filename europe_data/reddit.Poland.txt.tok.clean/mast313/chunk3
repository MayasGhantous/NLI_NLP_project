  you mean escorting without killing attacker ? 
  murica wo n't be proud of you ... 
  but it 's pretty hard to hit eagle with rocket . 
  [ it reminds me of this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8htz0cjandu ) [ lyrics ] ( http://www.diggiloo.net/?2003pl ), 
  so remember it and stop trying to be dead !, 
   so exactly like lithuanians . 
  i have decades of experience with them ( since soviet time , yes i 'm that old ) and it always confused/confuses me how easily lithuanians get angry over pointless things , especially when they misunderstand something . 
  exactly like your post . 
  in case of poles it may be random thing if you argue too much about it . 
  lithuanians have their gentle things ( like history  ) that they have outbursts about . 
  lithuanians are also more patient . 
   too much national pride . 
  lithuanians have megalomania , poles have glory and some are really proud just of being polish . 
    so exactly like lithuanians . 
  at least if we go by our pov . 
  relligion is more important in poland that in lithuania . 
  at school we learn that in past while nobels and farmers sucked , priest were doing great job . 
  ( i know it because i 'm 16 now )  also poles are much more friendlier than lithuanians and less depressed overall . 
  i was n't in lithuania , but as far as i know it 's true . 
  it 's just different culture . 
  there is polish series `` what foreigns feels about poland ? 
  '' , while southern foreigns says that we are cold , [ foreigns from north says that we are friendlier ] ( https://youtu.be/bnsx_jxpffa?t=390 ) . 
  poles also take things more easly , and it 's not in their habit of worry too much . 
  it 's also my personal expirience , or more likely conclusions . 
  ^ sorry ^ for ^ my ^ english . 
  in eastern-polish dialect `` dziug '' means something very disgusting . 
  i do n't think so ... 
  she nailed it !, 
   there will be only salt and vinegar . 
  just like at communism ? 
  of course . 
  you do n't have reason to get closer to poland and we have reason to stick with v4 because of same political opinions . 
  and ok but that was only idk 50 years ? 
  grumble grumble ^ grumble ^ ^ grumble ^ ^ ^ grumble ... edit : you say it only because you are trying to make us sad !, 
  yeah but after some time you would just become germans . 
  i do n't believe that you will be better in union with prussia . 
   it is a passionate defense of prussian lithuanian ( lietuvininkai ) language and culture , rallying people to resist germanisation attempts . 
  sorry but after some time it would just happen . 
  oh come on , it was fun !, 
  if you would make union with germany you probably would n't exist as separate nation by now . 
  no we wo n't hurt it . 
  you know that in union like in marriage - vilnius is also important . 
  [ like this ?

  but remember that minority if too oppressed may hurt your anus ... ups ... 
   but you see ? 
  good to have us there !, 
  [ maybe more like this ? 
  i still see poles on 11 picture . 
  btw as i know lithuanians , there is not much people on streets because you are [ hanging out with friends ] ( http://www.roebuckclasses.com/101/resources/emodern/hangingtree.htm ) , 
  relationship ? 
  not just simply relations ? 
   i feel like there is still something to save . 
  relationship ? 
  not just simply relations ? 
   i feel like there is still something to save . 
  wow no people . 
  such empty . 
  and yeah very beautiful , 
  but look ... 
  if not poles this post would have only about 10 comments !, 
  we are the only that care about you . 
  please , staph !, 
  colorbot is way better :p / joke, 
  germany took you that region - favorite game of germany 's neighbors . 
  :d but ok , we can play '' britain won with you at this : '' instead if you want . 
   of course if you wo n't run away . 
  or just he is polish as lorraine and alsace are french . 
   e.g you ca n't look up album sales or awards or tv show appearances in the same way . 
  you also ca n't look at sales to compare musicians from 2016 and 1930 . 
  but anyway i understand what you mean . 
  from last how many years ? 
  i do n't believe that edyta g\u00f3rniak is more successful than chopin . 
   where there is a will , there is a way  in anthem we say `` we will cross wis\u0142a , we will cross warta '' so why do n't we cross ocean ? 
  :d  and who are we to speak against the glorious russia ^ ^ ^ mr.russia * ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ forget ... 
  oh i 'm not really into politics but as i 've read what he said , so yeah , there is something really wrong with him ... 
  sadly i must say that most polish people are not very interested in it and majority of these that are interested , think that he is actually protecting minority from evil , poles-hating lithuanians . 
  ( these people are also pro-russian through . ), 
  i 'm talking about comments under related news . 
  it just looks like now ukraine and baltic states ( especially lithuania because it 's connected to poland ) became main target for our russia-supporting nationalists . 
  rest of poles just did n't hear about such a creature . 
  : / edit : i was on mobile and i somehow did n't see rest of your comment . 
  it 's not just russia that wants make us fight , but some shit happened in our relationship some time ago . 
  as new century came this should n't be important anymore . 
  we are two very connected nations with same goals and vision of future , as well as mentality that fits together very well . 
  yes i fully agree with you we should be friends . 
  i hope that our politicians will make steps towards it by soothing the bads ( there will be anniversary of attacking vilnius by poland in few years and i hope that our president will say we are sorry for that as a nation ) , and just connecting the societies because we have very much in common . 
   ^ ^ and ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ my ^ ^ english . 
  wow i did n't know about this . 
  but anyway you had a chance to reach them , japan is on the other side of earth . 
   so basically you are kind of still in war against germany . 
  being thanks for sarcasm ? 
  wow i 've never expected to see it . 
  :d so maybe i will also say few more things about i know about lithuania . 
   - cepelinai and \u0161akotis are most known lithuanian dishes . 
  - instead of glorious `` w '' you use `` v '' . 
  - lithuanian books and culture is focused on feelings and is pretty deep . 
  - forgein words ( like hamburger ) are kind of lithuanized so you use words made by other lithuanian words . 
  - according to my uncle lithuanians are shy , polite and not honest . 
  - there is our politician that makes mess ( tomaszewski as far as i remember ) - folk songs are kind of important element of your culture ( and they sounds cool in my opinion .
