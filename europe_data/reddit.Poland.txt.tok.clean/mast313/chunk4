  just like the language . ), 
  with latvia and estonia you makes festival about them . 
  - beautifull lakes and `` golden summers '' as well as grey sky and soviet buildings . 
  - there is a lot of empty houses , especially at villages . 
  - as you mentioned pagan stuff . 
  as far as i know you can buy some pagan souvenirs there . 
  there are also some beliefs related to paganism . 
  - history and national heros but we learn about these here . 
  oh and that `` foch line '' was n't named like this because of lithuania and poland `` had focha '' on each other - in polish were angry at each other . 
   after christianity not after paganism ? 
  they pay for it in taxes . 
  pfff [ our pilot did it without any wheels .

  owww raising these flags without any wind moving them , looks so bad . 
   russia wants to give helping hand ... hehehe ... like always ... 
   minor problems with letter usage in names and street that 's way too much litwa !, 
  we war you !, 
  save europe ? 
  even `` make great again '' sounds better . 
  see ? 
  not only invest , but also piss off russia by capitalism . 
  good bros. . . 
  germans always make really good stuff , i hope that this laser wo n't be too good . 
  / joke, 
  they really do n't know how to make good bigos . 
  you are good guys , commonwealth bros [ you invest ] ( http://www.lrt.lt/en/news_in_english/29/23191/not_only_food_prices_draw_lithuanians_to_poland ), 
  would putin let him in ? 
  / joke, 
  guy religion can not just leave it like society can not leave paedophilia and liberty can not discriminate lgbt . 
  rules are different there , otherwise they would n't care . 
  shh we need more polish death camps xd, 
  ok thanks , your explanation was the best one here . 
  oh sorry my english is pretty bad :p but it was nothing important at all . 
  so if it comes to that guy idiots are everywhere and being gay or anything can be just official reason . 
  but as far as i know there are laws in europe that makes everyone equall and protected by law so any discrimination can not be outlawed . 
  but yeah rest of world can be different ... 
  no it does n't forcing anything but it makes lives of lgbt people in eastern europe harder . 
  of course it 's not reason why they should n't do it . 
  few whiles ago a guy explained me that reason for that is discrimination of lgbt people there . 
  okay if so , everything is cool ... ( i just did n't know that they are still discriminated at west ), 
  that sounds really nice and makes sense but religion is bigger deal at all . 
  ( at least here ) , 
  it 's called cultural portal . 
  i do n't mean `` just be normal '' but being gay could be easier accepted if it would be just being gay ( not gay parades in fancy outfits with didlos ) . 
  you are not going to accommodate ? 
  oh that 's your problem now ... poland is becoming more tolerant but you can not just force it to most catholic country in europe in so short period of time . 
  edit : yes religion is bigger deal than sexuality ( at least for us ) . 
  what is more important : why do you live , will you live in future , what should you do or who should you fuck ?

  of course that the do in poland , but i can promise you that it 's not a way you can fix it . 
  things like that make homo look even more different , so it 's harder for poles to accept that . 
  and yeah as i said religion is much bigger deal than sexuality . 
  but there is difference between festival of religion and festival of `` what you like '' . 
  marginalisation of lgbt in western countries ? 
  okay i did n't know about it . 
  marginalisation of lgbt in western countries ? 
  okay i did n't know about it . 
  but love and especially sex should be private no matter who they involve . 
  so homosexuals still have not the same rights ? 
  ( on west ), 
  so why is n't it normal festival then ? 
  i 'm sure that homosexuals are n't discriminated at festivals especially on west . 
  relevant username . 
  okay but it 's nothing to be proud of or try to show to everyone . 
  it 's like i would make parade for people that favourite colour is green . 
  yeah it makes homo look like different `` nation '' , not like people that like something different . 
  also sexuality is something private / hidden , it should n't be treated like that . 
  for eastern europeans it makes them look like bunch of crazy/mentally illed strangers .

  but please this time without italy ... 
  yeah . 
  germans think that they eat lithuanian food , but it 's brought in poland . 
  damn lithuanians !, 
  lithuanians do n't make crimes more often than others , but they are the only that organize it . 
   i would not ask americans to spell ma\u017eeikis . 
  and that 's the main difference between poles and lithuanians . 
  and kickass . 
   estonia -43.5 \u00b0 c  latvia -43.2 \u00b0 c  lithuania -42.9 \u00b0 c  belarus -42.2 \u00b0 c, 
  there are 3 armies next to kaliningrad oblast . 
  i feel that poland is not afraid of being attacked through belarus . 
  we trust them but ya know ... just look where we put our units . 
   we do not invade countries out of tradition . 
  heck , that 's what i feel about russia now . 
   our catholic church loves to voice their opinion on certain topics discussed in the parliament here you always know church 's opinion . 
  it always support pis . 
   mol\u0117tai - `` clay city '' that clay is clay !, 
  your coal gave me a cancer !, 
  yeah i wrote it on phone , so it did n't mark that stuff . 
  yes i know that you were n't forced , you would n't make union with us , if you would n't want to accept christianity . 
  teutonic order was stronger than lithuania , that was one of reasons for union .
