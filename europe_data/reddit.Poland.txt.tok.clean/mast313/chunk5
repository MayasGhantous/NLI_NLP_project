  livonian order failed at that , not teutonic . 
  also teutonic order was invited by our king , to fight against prussia . 
  do n't mind if i wo n't respond - i will be travelling . 
  as far as i know tetonic order was much stronger than you . 
  you can not became catholic by yourself , stupid . 
  we have low wages in poland that 's true , but free time he will for sure spend in poland . 
  :p  if jesus would return ** would ? 
  ** you are not glorious catholic , you are only pretending !, 
  ** shame on you !, 
  vatican city ? 
  was it the summer house of our pope ? 
   oh , too bad you abandoned it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ soon ...  because less is more in catholicism , amateurs !, 
  but god is infinite , and less * infinite = infinite . 
  we can not make infinite monument , but that 's enough . 
   our marija glows in the dark hahaha . 
  we have glowing marijas in every house !, 
   we sent a song called '' mary magdalene '' to the eurovision . 
  we took second place with song '' [ i was n't eve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/to_nie_ja ! ) '' . 
   we saved vienna from kebab no way !, 
  we saved europe from kebeb !, 
   do you have to specifically call them '' catholic '' ? 
  yeah but ya know ... western influence : / edit : i meant there are only programs about religion . 
  in addition : [ - we have tv series about priest solving criminal stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ojciec_mateusz ) - we resurrected like [ jezus , but two times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) , [ 2 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:rzeczpospolitapodrozb.png ) !, 
  - [ we would stop russia , if we did n't want to make it catholic . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_dmitriy_i#policies_as_tsar ) - even in [ japanese disgusting ( because gay like ) anime about countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hetalia:_axis_powers ) poland is ** cross ** dresser [ 1 ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_c4fsezixpjm/twelfgqugoi/aaaaaaaaaeq/okx4y--patg/hws45p9.jpg ) - when we enter someone 's house we say `` may be praised jesus christ '' and others answer `` for centuries of centuries ( forever ) amen '' . 
  edit : and who hosted and will host '' [ world youth days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_youth_day ) '' ? 
  we had miracles too . 
  actually she showed herself here few times . 
  yeah but at this time we were christianizing [ your dear baltic brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg ) . 
  they did n't want to became catholic , so we asked [ catholic thugs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order ) for help . 
  do you miss them ? 
  [ we both are nearly 90 % catholic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/distribution_of_catholics.png ) , but at time of commonwealth our motto was `` if god is with us , then who is against us ? '' . 
  we had a pope !, 
  we were going to make ban on `` in vitro '' and abortion . 
  [ we have the biggest monument of jezus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwyliagofi ) . 
  [ maria is our queen . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lw%c3%b3w_oath#the_lw.c3.b3w_oath ) ( we sing `` maria our queen '' ) [ we were asking `` where is saint cross ? '' ] ( https://youtu.be/ccjvamzxb4e?t=15 ) !, 
  [ and we christianized lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization_of_lithuania ) . 
  so who is more glorious catholic now ? 
  edit : we also have [ catholic radio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_maryja ) and [ catholic tv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telewizja_trwam ) . 
  but baltic duo is not baltic trio . 
  and c'mon `` baltic duo '' ? 
  that sounds horrible !, 
  shhh ... lithuania and latvia would be sad and lonely without you . 
  i heard the same about poland . 
  after that and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gcygbznup4 ) i find lithuanians amazing . 
  because , ** who need tanks when you have ** ... ~ ~ [ weapons from soviet times ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_land_force ) ~ ~ [ that guy !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/aw_dzdpppeq?t=34 ), 
  ... away from germany or russia . 
  i think that it 's more like : country = clay + everything on that clay ( including people ), 
  no it 's not , no one require it from you . 
  most people ( at least poles and lithuanians ) knows that relations between these two nations gone wrong . 
  also that 's feeling/opinion of this one guy , not whole poland . 
  in addition this thread ask about favorite country , not nation ( that you like ) . 
  it 's not rude . 
  yes we are provoking you ~ ~ to declare war on us ~ ~ show how you hate us , by saying that we like you . 
  germany , because it watch over us and ~ ~ does n't allow ~ ~ tries to not allow us to do anything stupid . 
  lithuania because [ soooo much ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/50368395.jpg ) of our culture came from it . 
   dear @denmarkdotdk keep your beaches ... 
  i died . 
  :d when sweden came up with hetalia , denmark knew that they should stop ... 
   nordic axis can esti into axis ? 
  i tried to use proxy , but the easiest way was to [ google it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amc_7wonyoy ) . 
  in polish he 's known as `` ivan the dangerous '' ( gro\u017any ) . 
  [ why is lithuania there ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/kjqk_c27sey?t=67 ) ( [ the man on horse . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania ) ), 
  but you know . 
  you can hit/bash someone with this shield ... 
  press f12 and paste this $ ( '' . on '' ) . unbind ( ) $ ( '' . on '' ) . on ( ` click ' , function ( ) { $ ( `` head link '' ) . html ( ' < img src = '' ''  ' ) } ) there is no plan ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ( yes ^ ^ ^ copied ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ mind314 's ^ ^ ^ comment ), 
  pretend that you are army of neutral switzerland and nuke them . 
  i just meant that normal missiles are more accurate . 
  whatever , as you said i do n't really know much about that . 
   and yet it 's still common when a single missile blows up dosens of civilians around the target . 
  no ...  actual bombs however kill and maim in significant radius regardless . 
  yes but cluster bombs hits random points . 
  normal missiles : [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/knrv33diomq?t=1 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/kceorae6yog?t=93 ) . 
  cluster bombs : [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/5q0ulciz6fe?t=2 ), 
  [ i should n't link my own comments but ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k27q7/how_to_irritate_a_citizen_of_each_european/d3bjn98 ), 
  yeah the main reason are [ unexploded cluster bomblets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cluster_munition#threat_to_civilians ) . 
   on the knights ' northward return , however , they encountered a determined group of samogitians at a river ** cross ** ing . 
  unwilling to risk losing their horses in the swampland , the holsteiners refused to fight on foot , forcing the knights to camp for the night . 
  when even cross says you that you should stop , but you do n't listen . 
  yeah but the most important crossbows killed one person per shoot , cluster bombs explode on big area ( may possibly kill civilians ) . 
  by the way , i do n't know why did church tried to ban ** cross ** bow . 
  meh ... [ perun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perun ) is the only true god !, 
  i did n't know that they want to be so separated . 
  it looks more like colony than minority . 
  it 's not about `` little '' . 
  it 's about distinguishing immigrants from the rest of society . 
  [ here i 'm . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/k2ysuszceoe?t=32 ) not really angry but do n't know how to explain something that is clear for me . 
  i know why do you call it little but calling a place where a lot of poles live `` poland '' is like saying that the most important thing is nationality . 
  british says that poles do n't integrate in uk , but things like this make it more difficult for them . 
  some jews lives on street of my town . 
  since now i will call it `` ghetto '' and i will try to explain them that they can not be offended by this . 
  yes , everyone can be offended by stuff like this and it is at least very rude . 
  also when i live all the time in a country it 's also my country .
