  guess how would immigrant from africa feel if someone would call district in his town where he and he 's family/friends live `` little africa '' ? 
   i guess that if we had a paradox game simulating modern politics i 'm talking about political war . 
  [ hetalia approved . 
  [ lithuania ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian%e2%80%93polish%e2%80%93ukrainian_brigade ), 
  i guess that lithuania likes you too . 
  we have common goals and enemies . 
  i guess that we would be really close if not these nationalists . 
  we need to convince belarus at first . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ it ^ ^ will ^ ^ be ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ hard, 
  after all it 's european union , but canada ? 
  why not ? 
  but there wo n't be peace in poland . 
  here is always war-pis vs po . 
  mostly poles and italians thinks nearly the same . 
  yet another reason why [ we likes italy .

  ussr would n't care about partisans so much , they would focus on civilians . 
  you showed enough .

  but even if lithuania would defend itself this time , ussr would try again after winter war . 
  lithuania was too small to defend itself and ussr would never let it be independent . 
   we probably could have hold on our own . 
  you had n't choice . 
  some poles lives there , some work there and spend money in poland . 
  but some do it because they have a serious problem with poland . 
  * there is a lot of poles in poland . 
  * ( culture , mentality ), 
  but i did n't say that they suffered . 
  i said that lithuania attacked first . 
  ( i always thought that lithuania annexed rus but russia was going to take it too ),

  temporary alliances among lithuanian dukes often sufficed for military ventures into , and plundering of , these lands . 
  seems that lithuania started even this one . 
  mh i always thought that russia was the one who started the series of wars . 
  now it looks pretty different . 
  [ i had to . 
  ... and italians !, 
   want nothing more than to see us in ruin no that 's not true and it 's insulting !, 
  ^ ^ where ^ ^ would ^ ^ we ^ ^ emigrate ^ ^ if ^ ^ britain ^ ^ will ^ ^ be ^ ^ in ^ ^ ruin ? 
  russian tanks seems to be better . 
  eastern european , probably estonia or lithuania . 
  belarus is interested in russia not russia in belarus . 
  i was lurking at / r/depression and every day there is at least one post that says something like `` i want hug '' . 
  so she says that the main reason why lithuanians make so much suicides is that they do n't talk about emotions . 
  why ? 
  does nobody care , is it some kind of taboo or just lithuanians do n't want to talk about things like that ? 
  so are suicides still so common in lithuania ? 
  i heard that 's mainly because of lithuanian culture ( being shy and hiding emotions ) , but it ca n't make whole country suicidal . 
   minimum of 30mbps broadband an `` enforceable right '' [ i feels sooo bad right now ... ] ( http://www.speedtest.pl/test/130747152 ),

  did you forget about `` lithuania have no culture '' , `` lithuanians are poor farmers '' and `` lithuania is polish/russian colony '' ? 
   you 're basically russian  you 're basically polish  where is lithuania ? 
  basically between poland and russia . 
  europe is not guilty for their failed attempts . 
  what should we do ? 
  transport milions of people by planes and ships ? 
  their home is not sinking ship and we are not unhabitated island . 
  we take these , that are in our borders , we give them money to make them adapt to country that they will live in and we treat them like our citizens . 
  it 's all we can/should do . 
  edit : yes i know that it 's only data but it triggered me . 
   9 deaths in poland/germany border because of trying to cross the river .

   why does russia fear the lithuanian special forces ?

  poor ando :(, 
  wow lithuania looks so nice at summer . 
  [ like this ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vbizefoco-w ), 
  on that picture rysy looks like peak of whole world . 
  pole here , i guess pi\u0142sudski may be an example . 
  he attacked lithuania , imprisoned political enemies , attacked russia , became a ruler using some kind of revolt ( but it actually was a good thing ) and as far as i remember attacked other countries . 
  he also was getting along with hitler and mussolini before they were so radical . 
  he wanted to , and made poland authoritarian . 
  but he also was fighting and won war against russia and did a lot for our independence which makes him our national hero . 
  that makes much more sense , thanks . 
  what is hungary doing here ? 
  yet every polish person is absolutely sure , we have the highest prices in whole europe . 
  i feel you can make a meme out of this .
