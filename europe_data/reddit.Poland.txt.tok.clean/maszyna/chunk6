  if it 's socialist , fascist or whatever . 
  it 's all the same : very little regard for individual rights and freedoms and total submission of the individual to `` society/state '' . 
  so nazism was n't marxist . 
  big news . 
  but it still had a centrally controlled economy , a one party political system , social programmes , state sponsored work , state owned industries , a thick bureaucracy , very limited personal freedoms and no regard for individualism . 
  `` oh but it supported private property '' ... big deal ... you could own shit in communist russia . 
  only because it 's not 100 % text-book socialism does n't mean that it 's not socialism at all . 
   thats has literally been standard protocol for a abandoned suitcase in forever . 
  are you too young and ca n't remember the world before 2001 ? 
   im just saying that life here is exactly the same as it has always been . 
  is it really ? 
  i remember a time where i was allowed to take a drink onto a plane and did n't have to strip down my shoes when boarding . 
   noone is avoiding train stations or concerts , not taking the plane or staying at home in fear . 
  that 's something you neither can prove nor disprove . 
  so not really a valid argument . 
  see , your initial post is dumb . 
  you 're implying i was `` lying '' if in fact all i was doing is stating facts . 
  ( read up on national socialism - it had all the hallmarks of socialism . ), 
  also your question ... `` so doing something immoral is fine if it supports your cause ? '' . 
  what do you expect for an answer but the obvious `` no '' ? 
  it 's a cheap rhetoric parlour trick . 
  so sorry if i do n't take you seriously . 
   and 90 % + of germans arent afraid yeah , i 'm sure they all feel perfectly safe and do n't care about abandoned suit cases at train stations ... oh wait ... they close down a major train station when they find one : http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/hauptbahnhof-duesseldorf-herrenloses-gepaeck-sorgte-fuer-polizei-grosseinsatz-aid-1.5568910 only because you got used to bullshit like `` we have to undress shoes before we enter a plane '' does n't mean that you 're not living in fear . 
  you just learned to live with it . 
  so turning the truth into `` lies '' is fine if it supports your ideology ? 
  i was on school exchange in germany when 9/11 happened . 
  there were quiet a few kids who were n't too unhappy about the twin towers . 
  some were `` anti american leftists '' ( those attac/greenpeace types ) but most were ... eh ... \\* censored \\* now they were n't dancing per se . 
  but for example they refused to take part in the school wide moment of silence . 
  liberia . 
  it was created for this purpose anyways . 
  but in 20 years all politicians will have their pensions and will be living somewhere far away where there 's no problems . 
   we need to dispell the notion that hitler were a socialist no we do n't . 
  because it shows how dangerous statist socialism in reality is . 
  well , he would be a socialist today too . 
  only that his kind of socialism killed rather quickly . 
  do n't they have beef with muslims though ? 
  iirc there 's unrest in india where those both religions meet . 
  i could n't imagine a country less threatening to poland than france . 
  i 'd be more worried about a canadian invasion than an attack by france . 
  forgot the eastern bloc ? 
  do you think russia would leave the eu intact if it were n't for the nato deterrent ? 
  look at what they did in crimea . 
  why should they stop there ? 
  why not get their `` historic '' sphere of influence back ? 
  turn your country into a shithole and exploit its population . 
   it was a tragic mistake . 
  you never know for sure with putin . 
  murder of opposition leader ? 
  tragic mistake . 
  polonium in tea ? 
  tragic mistake . 
   avoid a humanitarian crisis but that wo n't avoid the crisis . 
  just move it northwards . 
  and even then you start sending them back only 25 years after the end of the war ... 
  but it 's not funny if it 's true . 
  my comment is more about the posters here on reddit than on pis or merkel . 
  people seem to be applying double standards . 
  where in case a it 's totally hilterlevel bad when a politician intermingles with the judiciary ( which it is ) and in case b they expect another politician to intermingle with the judiciary because they do n't like erdogan . 
  that 's creative . 
  a court banned `` protesters '' to recite bohnemann 's poem in front of the turkish embassy in berlin . 
  justification is that reciting the poem ** might ** be a crime ( they do n't know for sure until there 's a ruling in the bonemann process ) so they preemptively banned it to be sure  i guess they 're still allowed to chant there some hippy songs because they still believe they 're living in a country with free speech . 
  but no poems . 
  it 's funny how we in poland do n't have free speech/democracy even though kod can march and protest against the government unmolested but in germany where they are the beacon of freedom it 's forbidden to recite a poem because it ** might ** be illegal . 
   i just find it pathetic , disgraceful , damaging and dangerous to prosecute people for . 
  yes , but it 's still a law . 
  if you start applying laws selectively you end up in putin 's russia . 
  certainty of the law goes both ways . 
  nah , not really . 
  it were german-owned publications in germany having a show fight with german-owned publications in poland . 
  no one really takes that shit seriously when some springer-owned tabloid prints a merkel-in-nazi uniform because some other springer-owned tabloid printed kaczynski-potato . 
  i just do n't like how you resort to calling your neighbors names/insulting them directly . 
  like a guy below said `` inselaffen '' for brits . 
  `` car stealing thieves '' for poles . 
  whatever . 
  that 's not humor - that 's hate with laughter . 
   it 's still a violation of free speech i doubt he would get away with calling anyone `` goat fucker '' in germany . 
  insulting people is illegal in germany iirc so it 's not a violation of german free speech . 
  but if she ca n't give a go she as hell ca n't prevent it , too . 
  so why did she indicate anything but `` lol , not my deal because i have no influence over the judiciary '' ? 
  why were people waiting for her anyway ? 
  she should have 0 influence over courts and prosecutors . 
   exactly . 
  so many people think she should be able to decide what happens . 
   while at the same time giving shit to poland 's pis . 
  double standards everywhere . 
  / edit : before you downvote : i 'm not advocating for pis to ignore court rulings . 
  just that germany adheres to the same standards they hold others up against . 
  well , in a country where insulting someone is a criminal offense people should n't wonder if you get prosecuted for calling someone a `` goat fucker '' . 
  i do n't get what the fuzz is all about because calling people names has been illegal in germany for quiet some time . 
  whom are they giving shit now ? 
  merkel ? 
  if you 're so enraged maybe start an initiative to change the laws ? 
   the most funny sorry m8 . 
  but that erdogan-poem was n't really funny . 
   and insulting that 's more like it . 
  but that 's german humor i guess because erdogan is n't the first one you did such derogatory jokes about . 
  most of your neighbors got their fair share of `` german humor '' ... so excuse me if i do n't help you in  help us insult erdogan to the point of causing an international incident . 
  protect dem fee fees . 
  that safety valve is called `` not having retarded laws in the first place '' and not `` the government should be able to influence the judiciary '' ...
