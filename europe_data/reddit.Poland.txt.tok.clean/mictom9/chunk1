russians are eager to teach me their language when we play dota . 
  act like ( the ) french , what the fuck does it even mean ? 
  that 's some top level bullshit my friend . 
  [ yeah ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rddmy_as3t8 ), 
  til , thanks . 
  it still does n't make the map less controversional . 
  well , i took my irish course 4 years ago but back then my professor said that even though there are a lot of people and resources devoted to the language revival the effects are n't satisfactory . 
  he mentioned that it is indeed spoken in some rural areas but english still prevails . 
  i know that language maps can never really do the justice to the reality but the minority languages in this one seem really wierd . 
  for example , belarussian has too big range and is not actually used as the first language , gaelic is very rare to be spoken at all , more `` russian '' dots should be placed in latvia and estonia . 
  also , is breton really used over french in brittany ? 
  everything you said is shadowed by one most important argument - why would anyone stay in poland when there is an economy 3 or 4 times bigger so near to the west . 
  actually , polish-german border is one of the largest discrepancy border in terms of economy in the whole world . 
  you might say the same thing is applicable to czech rep. and slovakia but most of their percents are raised by migrations between these two populations . 
  tl ; dr : things you listed are not as influential as you might think . 
  i 'm not a great fan of polish movies but [ seksmisja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088083/ ) and [ d\u0142ug ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0225535/ ) are really fine pieces . 
  also , i love [ psy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105185/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) but it might be a bit corny in the big scheme of world cinematography . 
  i wonder if their `` r ' is always so rhotic or is it just there just for artistic purpose . 
  if you will , would like to educate myself a bit . 
  is there any significant opposition towards ` macedonian agenda ' clearly held in your country ? 
  if macedonia would change its name what would that be ? 
  are there any alternatives ? 
  what are greek-macedonian relations when it comes to ordinary people ? 
  do they care about politics or just leave it to politicians ? 
  why, 
  i cringed so hard i ca n't uncringe now help . 
  there 's no good reason for this , we use the same alphabet . 
  i ca n't agree with ` sad ' . 
  at least no more than other countries either western or eastern that i 've been to . 
  you might be thinking about ` british smile ' . 
  there 's a subreddit for these, 
  this map is painful to watch, 
  hungarian and greek/turkish, 
  it 's awful, 
  now that 's what i call a good reputation . 
  brilliant !, 
  he 's far from being ` poor ilyich ' though . 
  he 's mass murder and totalitarian ruler . 
  uhm . . why would n't there be garbage like ` radio maria ' if some people like it . 
  i mean , you 're not forced to listen to that . 
  it does n't matter because we would more likely adopt kanji to cyrillic if given a choice . 
  the only person i know is my mother who watches every singing contest show anyway . 
  yeah , probably if we sent our guys there more often the hype would jump up . 
  we mostly do n't care here . 
  the white ribbon - ger life is beautiful - ita, 
  huh ? 
  putin just plays the game the eu started . 
  because i believe that environment issues should be independent issues of each eu state . 
  of course , i 'm only talking about laws imposed by the eu , not the global treaties like the kyoto protocol . 
  if only they would n't impose their fight on others . 
  alright , thanks . 
  til ~ ~ ukrainian ~ ~ russian month names resemble those from roman calendar . 
  i do n't know why but i thought polish names came from proto-slavic or some common slavic tradition . 
  oh , so that was the reason . 
  god damn it , ads, 
  loosely escapist : dzie\u0144 \u015bwira ( polish ) oh boy ( german ), 
  apolland ( you know , apollo mission + poland ) and he/she would be some kind of solitary space traveler i guess . 
  it 's a rather complicated relationship to say the least . 
  love their side of the tatras more then ours . 
  love their language . 
  and ... lunik ix . 
  [ when we are at hungary . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii-iwzojh2k ), 
  i question proportions . 
  every single thing in this world is worth discussing . 
  but nevermind , this one seems to me quite infertile . 
  now that 's interesting , are you here for the first time ? 
  everytime something related to the issue comes up it gets more upvotes than anything else . 
  you know , it 's like this everywhere - there 's less than 1 % of homosexuals in poland but i hear about them everyday . 
  in my opinion , the whole lgbt thing is in mainstream of european issues and people like be vocal about it . 
  i just do n't like that this trend is followed here . 
  by the way , i 'm sure politicians love when such subjects are talked over because it distracts society from more serious ( economical , political , etc. ), 
  issues . 
  looking at this subreddit one can assume there 's nothing more important in europe than gay issues . 
  you might be right i felt it was his opinion , not a joke . 
  my point was , i could n't see any point of reference between an american democrat from 2013 and adolf hitler . 
  obama has as much to do with the nazis as for example barroso , a leftist , has to do with stalin . 
  also , berlin suffered greatly from actions of politicial left as well , like the building of the berlin wall . 
  why ? 
  he surely has a nice cv of bantering . 
  czech republic, 
  i expressed it so mildly because the last time i 've been there was 5 years ago . 
  also , from my experience , atmosphere was always incredible there , wherever it was , but logistics was n't that great and many people were put off by it . 
  [ woodstock station ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/przystanek_woodstock ) and [ open ` er festival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%27er_festival ) are fine , check them out . 
  [ here you go . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ), 
  i 'm not an expert in german literature but i thought ` im westen nichts neues ' was a great piece of literature . 
  really , i 've heard it at least three times already . 
  i do n't watch polish news so i ca n't say how it looks like here , but my guess is they would rather discuss pope 's stomach ache than anything related to mandela . 
  sure , but that 's the case . 
  when mandela passes away many people will be like ` hey , i thought this guy died 20 years ago ' . 
  until yesterday i was quite sure christopher lloyd of ` back to the future ' was dead . 
  also , many people seem to assume mandela is not among the living anymore . 
  wow , that 's great . 
  this fellow is really praised down there . 
   thanks , i surely will visit chicago in the future . 
  do n't worry , i 'm aware that a small degree of crime is unavoidable in every big metropolitan area . 
  yeah , most poles consider chicago a place across the pond we can somehow relate to . 
  i 'd really like to see some day how the polish culture preserved there .
