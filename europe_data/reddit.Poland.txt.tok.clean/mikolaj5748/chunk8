  i do n't have to live in the ussr to know some history mate . 
   i sincerely doubt that . 
  it 's too profitable for you . 
  being dependent is not very profitable at all . 
  what does the term `` nationalist '' even mean to you ? 
  in the west people do n't even know what is it , but they are first to say this word and use it as a synonime with `` fascist '' , `` nazi '' , `` patriotic '' , `` rightwinged '' . 
  and the politics are not about sympathising with someone , it 's just about fighting for country 's interests . 
  also the polish nationalists do not like russia at all . 
  our most popular nationalist party , ruch narodowy , is actually pro-american . 
  the only pro-russian parties are the leftist ones with less than 0,5 % of support . 
   it would be very strange if you changed that view after leaving the eu , dont you think ? 
  no , that would be pragmatic move . 
   but come on , are we really drawing scenarios of poland leaving the eu due to the current issues ? 
  i do n't know what 's so bad about it . 
  if the eu will keep behaving like the ussr , we would even leave on our own way . 
  but i hope this circus with our current government breaking law will end , and the eu would fuck off . 
   return to more deals with russia and china ftfy, 
  i think the eu is being more compared to the ussr than to the reich here anyway ... 
  isis did nothing wrong !, 
  he has just joked about the leftists ... 
  they can be even europe 's san marino national team , if they want . 
   neutral press  poland choose one, 
  it does carry the same millitary meaning as it is in english . 
  it probably came from a 13th century poland 's leader of senate ( which had 5 people ) , which was called `` the great royal marschall '' ( [ source in polish ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/marsza%c5%82ek_wielki_koronny ) ) , or from the `` marsza\u0142ek nadworny '' ( failed to translate this to english ) from the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  ( [ source again in polish ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/marsza%c5%82ek_nadworny_koronny ) ) this title was also given to the `` leader of the parliament '' later . 
  tl : dr because of the tradition, 
  i did n't know what does the term `` the head of the european parliament '' mean . 
  til , because in polish this function is called `` the marshall of the parliament '' . 
   martin schulz stopped reading there . 
  our gov. 
  has been already compared to orban , putin , lukashenko , and pi\u0142sudski . 
  i 'm waiting for media to compare it to hitler . 
  jajaja portugal spain annects yuo . 
  you might be right ... 
  i did n't notice that he has the negative comment karma . 
  what 's the logic in treating someone like an idiot ... because he is new ? 
  media led by anti-gov . 
  propagandists vs. media led by the government ... i do n't even know which one of them would be better . 
  poland has the superpower of being poor even while having not that awful gdp . 
   replacing pro-po judges by the state-loyal judges  being authoritarian/stupid, 
  ... by the silly articles like this . 
  i got ta too ... that was the least worthy / r/europe comment i 've read ... 
  your comparison with masuria and pommerania was just dumb , and i told you even why . 
  not very , they were at first , but now pln is growing up . 
  not very ok , but acceptable , that 's what it means you moron !, 
  it 's not very fine , but they had a reason ( or at least `` pretecst '' ) to take pover russian-dominated crimea ( donbass is more taken by the rebels , but we all know who supports them and gives them weapons ) . 
  and nothing more , that 's the point of this . 
  also we were betrayed by the west when they made some nordstream deals with russia , so they do n't really care about it , why should we care then ? 
  no , because pomorze and mazury do n't have a foreign majority , and they are de-facto in armistice , not war . 
  i think we should give up our `` economical fight '' with russia , because situation in ukraine seems stable , and it 's not important now . 
  m4 is unavaliable for tt, 
   pis  nationalist yup , they are right-wing ( not economicly ) , but they are more devoutly-catholic than nationalist . 
  finally not a `` omg how polish gov. 
  is awful ! '', 
  ignorant article ... gj / r/europe, 
  polan can into being influencial on former-commonwealths, 
  til country which has taken some eurofunds has to be germany 's slave . 
  like the previous gov. 
  did n't brake the law ... 
  i do n't understand europe . 
  he is actually from anatolia ... 
  does russia need to exist ? 
  lets be honest . 
  culturaly they are basicly ukraine and on top of that they cant live without ukraine as it 's client . 
  it would be better for everyone if they would join ukraine, 
  i do n't even care ... it 's just funny that they hate their own leader ... 
   david cameron  uk -7 %  angela merkel  germany -8 %  francois hollande  france -46 % western europe - what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  i do n't know what the hell being `` euro-realist '' have to do with our obvious economical growth . 
  does the fact that we have economical growth mean that we must do whatever eu say ? 
  if we did what they say , our whole energy market would be well ... fucked up . 
  i can ask you same question . 
  however , nazgobius used an invalid argument `` it 's american newspaper !, 
  it ca n't be biased !, 
  til us newspapers have to be always truth-telling . 
  can you just stop with this . n/po propaganda ? 
  po elected their own people there , cuz they knew they were going to lose , and now they are destroying our country - only to retake some percents . 
  pis also fucked up , but they are still getting demonized . 
  this whole affair is just opposition making poland pathetic in the eyes of the world , not any fucking `` fight for democracy '' . 
  it 's more likely to get cancer , than to be randomly controlled . 
  almost nobody checks in our metro line if you actually bought a ticket . 
  our `` emergency entry '' is usually open , so everybody can go through it without having his/her ticket used . 
  they are kinda the real `` cheap working power '' ( however it is called in english ) , personally i know many ukrainian workers/plumbers/hairdressers etc. 
  and you say , that poland needs to take arabic people as a cheap working power in order to prosper ? 
  well , not really ; we have even a better cheap labour , since not many of ukrainians are on social benefits here . 
   christmas goat wtf finland ? 
  i fell kinda both happy and sorry for them in the same time ... 
  happy , because immigrants will be not a problem here , and sorry , because we are being too big assholes sometimes ... 
  however , i 'd rather to be sceptical instead of `` refugees welcome '' all the way ... 
  this whole affair about the counstitutional court is just a fight between political parties . 
  both po and pis did wrong , i hope these parties will stop fighting soon cuz it only destroys our country . 
  i dunno why you are so happy ` bout it , 
  seems like for angela and company it is not that obvious . 
  schengen was one of many reasons why did poland join the eu . 
  without it , we would feel a bit tricked . 
  even in the eu you are not the poorest country . 
  it 's bulgaria , if i 'm not wrong . 
  greece is far away from being europe 's poorest country ... 
  the poorest one is moldova , or kosovo , but definetly not greece . 
  still the water level wo n't rise , however it 's not very likely for the whole ice of antarctica to melt . 
  and what the fuck have eastern poland and `` the future of the world '' to do with germany and france making deals with russia , their economical `` enemy '' ?
