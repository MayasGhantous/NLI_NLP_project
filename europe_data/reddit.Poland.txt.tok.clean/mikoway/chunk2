  in polish we have a variant of that one . 
  `` kto z kim przystaje , takim si\u0119 staje '' - `` who accompany someone , he/she will became the same '', 
  `` diabe\u0142 tkwi w szczeg\u00f3\u0142ach '' - `` the devil is embedded in details '' , similar o german . 
  that 's right , could be that . 
  when i read that one i just , how we say it - pad\u0142em . 
  soviet thinking at it 's finest . 
  one of their leader , thought that it was another ukriainian military plane and just after the shotdown he posted this on russian facebook . 
  use google translate to get rid of polish  [ here ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20140717155720/https://vk.com/wall-57424472_7256 ) is his original post from internet archiver before it was taken down from his wall . 
  come on , i 'm from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a which is one of the least religious cities and also i do n't have any of the problems that i described . 
  well , maybe , besides that sometimes my grandma grumble that she regrets that she wo n't see my `` proper '' wedding or going with her o church , `` like every pole should do '' , etc. 
  but still how could you not know about what i 've just described ? 
  it 's a common knowledge . 
  we have the one of the lowest birth rates in world and it 's not from lack of sex . 
  basically every polish catholic uses all kinds of contraceptives and do n't give a damn about church teachings . 
  because church is one thing , theater for grandpas but life is life . 
  yeah but i 'm presenting here the way that most of polish young adults follow . 
  it 's the least troublesome but you are still free to do whatever you want . 
  i think it 's quite popular aproach in poland . 
  i know agnostics or even atheists who took catholic marriage and babtise their kids so the family could be happy . 
  grandma will have nice wedding movie and bride a nice dress . 
  atheists does n't care and if this will keep your old folks very happy then why not ? 
  and the christmass eve is a great family gathering , with lots of yummy food . 
  i have no idea , i 'm not really into football . 
  half german , half polish ... just sayin ... : d, 
  they are very friendly people , funny southern poland-czech hybrids :d, 
  in poland not at all . 
  in the netherlands , czech republic or berlin i hav n't seen that either . 
  however in barcelona and valencia ( to lesser extent ) this view was omnipresent . 
  awful . 
  hahaha i have n't known that before . 
  but it reminds me of - gdzie diabe\u0142 m\u00f3wi dobranoc - '' where the divils says goodnight '', 
  aaaaha ` biased towards spd ' , the worst party in germany ( from polish perespective ) . 
  you are right . 
  but i do n't get the need to use all this heavy and unnecessary unparlimentary language in the example . 
  for me it does make perfect , sobering and disillusioned sense . 
  but i 'm polish . 
  that 's soo true !, 
  i figure that this is not about public transport but buses that parents rent for school trips . 
  every couple of years there is an accident involving such bus , mostly caussed by technical malfunctions and neglect . 
  polish : standard : * odludzie - `` away from humanity '' * dziura - `` hole '' * prowincja - `` province , non-city '' * gdzie psy dupami szczekaj\u0105 - `` where dogs bark with their asses '' * wygwizd\u00f3w - `` a place where the wind whistles/blows '' * gdzie diabe\u0142 m\u00f3wi dobranoc '' - '' where the devil says goodnight '' rude : * zadupie - `` behind ass '' * wypizd\u00f3wek - '' ` pussyfying ' / ` cuntyfing ' place '' fun fact : old polish * ukraina - '' the place behind the frontiers , on the verge of civilisation '' today this word still carry those emotions . 
  edit : words from comments below, 
  certainly we , poles , are disillusioned about everything . 
  eu and us bedroom isuess . 
  like good ` ol marriage . 
  mmm looks so delicious . 
  u urrrr of genious !, 
  no moarr paywalls !!, 
  do n't forget that sssr funded greens , leftist , anti-war and aniti-nuclear demonstarions and organisation in the west during the 60 ' and 70 ' . 
  do you seriously think that they will just give u such an effective means of influencing enemiy 's public opinion ? 
  i totally agree . 
  i would n't say that government is evil or russian/german angent or anything like that . 
  rather it 's unprofesional , clumsy and inefficient . 
  and heavily `` afera '' - prone . 
  if those things happen by the accident or not that 's the other thing . 
  in my opinion they want good for poland ( most of them , enyway ) but they are just incapable of pursuing their objectives . 
  lemmings are not pure or any evil . 
  they just act without reflection , follow the crowd , or are indifferent . 
  althouth now the term entered mainstream and sarted to mean just a shallow , conformist person . 
  edit : typos, 
  do n't forget about simplicifation of law for little companies , and unifying taxes . 
  that was also in their program . 
  maybe not in formal sense but they will likely vote similarly in parliment so in practise it will be a ` working coalition ' . 
  do n't forget the breakaway fraction of po as it is highly likely to happen . 
  i think it 's a shame that pis ca n't go to epp . 
  that way we would have had a counterweigh on germans in parliment lawmaking process . 
  do n't you think so ? 
  anyway this was amongs some rumors and predictions before last euro elections . 
  but the term ` lemmings ' has n't came out of thin air , has it ? 
  what is a name for a citizen in russian ? 
  write it in latin alphabet if you can , please . 
  as i 'm polish so it also could sound familiar to me too . 
  what about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe#mediaviewer/file:grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ), 
  just like poland, 
  he he he do n't forget about polish part :d, 
  i do n't find anything unusual in that . 
  lobbying and corruption are distinct things . 
  sometimes the line is blurred but the law is generally efficient here . 
  this thread is a goldmine for foreign open source intelligence analists , he he, 
  i totally agree wih you . 
  polish politics and top-buissnes clique is full , if not russian agents , then ex-agents or secret service ex-officers . 
  and our secret service was just an extension of the russian kgb, 
  hahaha :d, 
  we have done that social experiment and everyone can clearly see that it just does not work . 
  period . 
  there is not even an argument here because we have data and facts . 
  yeah , but this imperialistic policy impoverishess average russian citizens ... so he 's not acting in the best interests of his own nation . 
  only in the best interests of his clique of cronies and ever-increasing power hunger . 
  and i think it is an important distinction to be made here . 
  actually i was reffering to kaczy\u0144ski . 
  korwin was a high school thing . 
  we have already done that and have officialy registered lobbysts . 
  i think , after combining voting system of eesti and schweiz something really interesting could come out . 
  modern variation of citizen participatory voting system . 
  i imagie this that every citizen will have an opportunity ( not obligation ) to pass online exam of ` concious citizen ' . 
  this could be based od the current id veryfied coursera or edx system with your id and webcam turned on during exam . 
  after passing , a citizen could be able to participate in popular on-line voting , not only on local but also on national issues . 
  of course the parliment will be preserved and the decision making process will be a combination of online participatory and representative democracy . 
  what do you think ? 
  i think this could put new spirit into current system and restore citizens belive in democracy . 
  moreover that concept brings back old greek tradition in a modern , on-line , flavour and once again redisribute control .
