  it 's like like in german bundestag . 
  if you win election and do n't have majority in parliment ( which almost never happen ) you have to form a coalition , even with your arch enemy . 
  if pis manage to form colalition with currntly coalition partner psl and maybe hypothetical breakaway fraction of po members than yes . 
  if the constructive coalition could n't be created , new elections will be held . 
  remember year ago merkel took couple of months after elections to actually start governing : d, 
  stopped liking poland ; (, 
  we also participated in the soviet crackdown on anti-communist protests in czechoslovakia . 
  our later `` dictator '' jaruzelski , correct me if i 'm wrong , was a chief comander of this operation . 
  speaking of czechoslovakia after hitler annexed sudetenland we also annexed little peace of czech territory - zaolzie ( which had been ours long time ago ), 
  [ central banks are usually forbidden by law from purchasing debt directly from the government . 
  for example , the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( article 123 ) expressly forbids eu central banks ' direct purchase of debt of eu public bodies such as national governments . 
  their debt purchases have to be from the secondary markets . 
  monetizing debt is thus a two-step process where the government issues debt to finance its spending and the central bank purchases the debt , holding it until it comes due , and leaving the system with an increased supply of money . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monetization ) for me who recored that and why is the secondary case . 
  the real issue and the scope of this will be known on monday when further leaks will be relesed . 
  for now one thing is certain , central bank chief and minister of internal affairs broke constitution . 
  cbc should resign immediately if he want poland to look decent in the eyes of foreign invesgors . 
  because he did precisely the thing that they wanted to prevent if oposition would come to power . 
  having received no dementi from central bank nor from ministry we have to assume for this moment that the leaks are real . 
  except central poland for some part of it 's history was also civilized by polish-lithuanian commonwealth which was a unique culture , nested in the western christianity tradition . 
  funny example - king of france henry iii ( and for a short time of poland ) saw toilets for the first time in his live in cracow in wawel . 
  having returned to france he ordered to build them in his residence . 
  similar scenario unfolded in poland , although we have huge internal market , as well as german market . 
  that provided an econimic amortisation , rendering some part if the industry relatively intact . 
  however , one industrial area - \u0141\u00f3d\u017a shared similar scenario . 
  it was industrial monoculture , based on textile material and exported most of it 's output to the ussr . 
  after collapse and rise of asian textile market , is literally disapered . 
  as the aftermath \u0141\u00f3d\u017a fell down from the second most populus city to third and in terms of income to the very end of big-ciy ranking . 
  do n't forget that corruption is on the rise again . 
  i do n't expect po to win next elections so we will have a second chance to improve rankings performance : d, 
  god damn ruskies !, 
  poland , germany and denmark have [ multinational corps northeast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multinational_corps_northeast ) beside ue battlegroups . 
  stop whining already !, 
  obviously they bought it in the survival shop ; ), 
   i can assure you that the anti-russian stance of polish government is one of the most popular things this government has ever done . 
  agreed, 
  i agree with all comments below ( well maybe except about warsaw pact ) . 
  but still , you have to admit that the speech was great , was n't it ? 
  in case of poland i can see an inconsistency and a * mistake * . 
  [ national assembly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_assembly_%28poland%29 ) does not handle ordinary day-to-day legislation . 
  it is a joint assembley of the two houses of the parliament , that is senate ( upper house ) and sejm ( lower house ) . 
  it gathers only on special occasions and very rarely . 
  on every day basis we have [ parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_of_poland ) , which as i mentioned , is composed of two houses . 
  please , correct this if you want because it really * is * a mistake . 
  oj tam oj tam, 
  in polish like the first one, 
  same here, 
  and polish , 
  looks more like these synthetic drugs , like spice, 
  in poland we have the whole hooligan scene . 
  they organize [ ustawka ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpl.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fustawka ) . 
  type this in youtube , some movies are hilarious and terryfing . 
  however , they very rarely engage with normal people and mostly fight between themselves . 
  pop music : [ rebeka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo3zuyunabm ) [ the dumplings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsodefkiju0 ) [ brodka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ce1ypdxas ), 
  recently i 've pondered about it for a while . 
  if the situtation will come , despite my liberal viewpoint , having scientific background and occupation and my hobby interests in ethics and epistemology i will not hesitate to kill . 
  i think it 's a step in the right direction . 
  i would also love to see that at home . 
  another thing that 's really driving me crazy is the recent popularity o electric cigarets . 
  some cities have already banned them in public transport . 
  i think they should be banned in all public places just like normal cigaretes . 
  euro will be probably good but for more developed and advanced polish economy . 
  i will gladly see euro in maybe 10 years but now it 's only going to hamper our growth and render our service and manufacturengi sectors uncompetetive . 
  of course that this might give us more existantial security from russian threat but at the cost of lower living standards and decreased foreign investments . 
  i hope it 's not gon na happen soon, 
  i hate this crap, 
  holy roman empire + austro-hungary + polish-lithuanian commonwealth, 
  [ `` europa centralna '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) is the term which i know since primary school . 
  this is outdated and mis-informed . 
  it was handy in the cold war era but not now , since it includes only political aspect from before 90 ' . 
  this map completely ignores cultural and social aspects . 
  in other words , they forgot to include [ central europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) [ better map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ), 
  we have [ czech mistake ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/czeski_b%c5%82%c4%85d ) . 
  basically it 's about confusing letter order in some word . 
  the name probably comes from the fact that if you confuse letter order , word sound czech to us . 
  it is because you have similar words but spelled slightly diffrent . 
  is it even possible nowadays ? 
  i mean for polish speakers english is extremally easy to learn and use . 
  true true . 
  for a pole if you can speak fluent polish you are polish . 
  that 's it . 
  my parents used to say that they have found me in a cabbage in garden and that probably white stork left me there :d, 
  but that 's europe god damn , it is n't suposed to be that way , because ^ we ^ are ^ ^ centre ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ world ^ ^ ^ !, 
  holly shit . 
  but it is n't happening nowadays , is it ? 
  rumun - romanian rom/cygan - roma/gypsy, 
  also rumun ( plural rumuni ) gypsies are called rom ( plural romowie ) or cygan ( cyganie ), 
  central poland - confirmed . 
  although now chinese has replaced it  also when i was in the primary and middle school calling someone rumun meant that someone is dirty and does n't wash ... but it was around 2000s, 
  we have this kind of beer in poland . 
  tried once , it was disgusting . 
  holly shit . 
  i was watching his all reports on invasion of ukraine . 
  i hope that he 'll be all right . 
  he 's reports were the best . 
  they 'll steall rrr jobbs !, 
  you meant breaking bad on pirate bay  remeber 80 % of spaniards pirate and i think in poland it might even more , since i do not know anyone who watch something legally . 
  holly fuck :d now i know why they came out on the streets on maidan ( and the fact that they were earning like like 200 e a month ) they do n't even bother keeping appearances . 
   white tube socks with sandals polish fashion uber alles :d, 
  we always take shoes off when visiting unless you are specifically told by the host to keep them .
