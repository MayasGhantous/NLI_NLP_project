  and cold brrr, 
  poles just love russians . 
  we ca n't help it :d, 
  the government did n't bann it . 
  sure they wanted to but in the end it did n't happen . 
  and i think you confuse derusificasion with desovietisation . 
  they might overlap but dont have to . 
  in poland we also we have been fiercly derusyfing ( in your eyes ) everything but we did n't have russians so you have to use the term - desovietisation instead . 
  a yes , i always knew [ pogo\u0144 litewska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogo%c5%84_litewska ) from school and what 's more , despite that i 'm not a football fan at all i know that many polish footbal teams have name pogo\u0144 as a compound with a city name , like pogo\u0144 lw\u00f3w or pogo\u0144 szczecin . 
  what does that horse man symbolise ? 
  is it great lithuanian prince [ witold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vytautas ) ? 
  ( who was a cool dude btw ), 
  i would bet on our eagle just like germans have their fat one  wait ... i do n't anticipate euro !, 
  in fact i do n't want it at all :p, 
  never tried but really want to, 
  spain : [ jam\u00f3n serrano ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jam%c3%b3n_serrano ) , france : [ quiche with spinach and garlic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiche#other_varieties ) , netherlands : [ raw herring - we have similar in poland though ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soused_herring ) , lithuania : deep fried [ pelmeni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelmeni#regional_differences ) with sour cream !!!, 
  ( if u like pierogi , u 'll love these ) czech republic : [ sma\u017caki - fried cheese ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sma%c5%been%c3%bd_s%c3%bdr ) ,, 
  even to my own suprise , i actually agree with this . 
  but europe stopped , appologiesed , tried to make it up ( and know that it never can be undone ) . 
  russian are bragging , denying and on a course to repeat . 
  pan-slavism was almost always considered by polish elites ( and most population ) as a russian means for weakening the polish state . 
  at the same time it threatens the core polish identity which always considered itself as a power that carries enlightment to the east . 
  [ joseph conrad : '' ... between polonism and slavonism there is not so much hatred as a complete and ineradicable incompatibility . '', 
  ... conrad argues that `` nothing is more foreign than what in the literary world is called slavonism to his individual sensibility and the whole polish mentality '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-slavism#pan-slavism_in_poland ), 
  indeed . 
  in polish we do n't call him teribble but ivan gro\u017any ( threatening / grave / formidable ), 
  something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ), 
  same in poland , although we still struggle with `` friendlyfing '' the law for small and micro business . 
  according to [ freedom of the press 2014 index ] ( http://rsf.org/index2014/data/carte2014_en.png ) by reporters without borders , which are the counseling body to the un , polish media are one of the least biased of all . 
  type it in google translate and listen to it , 
  you 're not alone . 
  i only drink vodka like twice or three times a year . 
  and many people does that !, 
  beer is so much better than liquors , and i can drink like a lot of it . 
  yes , these two are the best . 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka with apple juice is my favourite . 
  but in the end , the best are beers from small , independent breweries !!, 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  `` w '' is pronounced the same as in german , that is like `` v '' . 
  so wyborowa is pronounced : vyborova, 
  truth , but from time to time another case pops out in local press . 
  usually somebody dealing them through internet is caught . 
  the smartshops are officialy illegal though . 
  right , they will rise , overthrow governments and greet russian tanks and soldiers with free food and cheers . 
  and then they will definitely let themselves to be occupied and robbed from freedom and money . 
  right , right buddy  just imagine that , frankfurters and berliners happily paying taxes to keep moscow economy spinning . 
  on the other hand a few us army boys on polish soil would n't hurt either , 
  and the poles !, 
  hahaha , yeah that 's exactly it  ), 
  that 's interesting . 
  i 'm polish and i use a lot emoji to whomever i talk to . 
  and many of my friedns also use this but it 's true that some people are quite anty-emoji . 
  btw . 
  these are my favourite : -_- ' oo  xd, 
  yea , nicely done . 
  when ukraine stand up on it 's feet and free itself from russia this would be the preffered ( by me ) way of dealing with this issue . 
  i studied in the netherlands , have been i a few contries ( including outside eu ) ans have international friends from there or other exchange students from my home city university . 
  first i feel polish , than maybe ... central european ? 
  than european . 
  i agree that certainly the eu is n't the best place to be right now . 
  but hey , do you have any other alternative ? 
  putin 's regime will only deepen country 's dependance on oligarchs humours and impoverish people further . 
  it also strip people from free thinkg , free media and in some sense free will ( degrating people to the homo sovieticus state ) besides who in the right mind would put oligarcho-autocratic cleptocracy in higher regard than imperfect democracy . 
  a , yes , that 's true . 
  i was in ukraine 3 times and i could exchange basic intentions . 
  but i was in western ukraine where most people know a little bit of polish for the sake of minor trade , little trips and cultural reasons . 
  so i think they were trying to emulate their language to sound as polish as it could and kept it very simple . 
  normal ukraininan conversation is uncomprehensable for me . 
  i have much more contact with english and german so my expertise is limited . 
  therefore your friend might be right that maybe difference between russian and ukrainian is bigger than i think . 
  i had a couple ocassions to hear them almost simultaniously when i was in ukraine ( in poland they are less frequent then english in real street life ) i could not hear any differecne . 
  if i was n't told i would n't even noticed . 
   polar opposite to the muddy , scabby sounds you hear in russian . 
  well , that 's exactly like it sound for me . 
  also russian sound very vulgar , overly simplitc and misbehaved . 
  like some shady person with bad intentions and without proper manners . 
  and that 's common perception amongs poles . 
  some say that despite that , it sounds melodic , though . 
  edit : russian to pole is the same as orc is to an elf . 
  long ago deprived by the dark force and looking in that mirror is a horror , 
  haha it 's so nice that i can understand czech and it 's hilarious in a very peculiar way . 
  as i listen to this , i feel like looking into a reflection of my own language in a mirror with some filter on it . 
  and that reflection brings tomy mind long forgotten words , very unusual ones or familiar ones but in a slightly different form . 
  it shows me how plastic the language can be . 
  this is a special thing that is very strange to articulate . 
  it happens only with czech and slovak . 
  it 's like : i do n't understand this but after a while your mind just decodes and you can understand quie a lot . 
  that 's totally different than english that i know a lot better than czech and understand right away without any delay for `` decoding '' . 
  or german that i know only on the intermidiate level and have to think to decipher it 's meaning . 
  but again , czech trigger some ancient roots of my language and allows me to feel it 's magic without concious effort . 
  so you must have mastered spanish more than me because i ca n't tell it apart from catalan . 
  the former just sounds like some more advanced spanish that i have n't learned yet . 
  i have nothing against that idea . 
  i think in most of europe english is seen as a neutral one . 
  and everobody speaks it ( at least our brave new eu generation xd ), 
  from polish perespective : despite knowing castellano a little , i can never distinguish if my friend speaks to me in castellano or catalan . 
  according to wikipedia catalan is something between spaniash and italian but for me it sounds just like ordinary spanish . 
  also on the street i could n't distinguish czech from slovak although i would be able to understand a lot . 
  i can not tell apart ukrainian from russian or belarussian and i understand them very little , only some general meaning .
