  the same goes for balkans . 
  german is quite distinct for me ( i know it on medium level ) , the same goes for dutch but all scandinavian sound the same . 
  or is it ? 
  i 'm 25 and i know only one friend that have kids . 
  but again , he is an uneducated one . 
  having kids at 25 yo now in poland is kinda frowned upon and unseen among academic youth . 
  personally i can not imagine such an inconveniance as a kid . 
  this is just not for me . 
  i like my relatively uncomplicated live and i 'm still educating myslef . 
  well , spanish has spanish flag but latin american piramides in the picture . 
  deal with that !, 
  no it 's not . 
  today even our defence minister mentioned it in an [ interview ] ( http://www.rp.pl/artykul/1091151,1092215-nie-powtorzyc-wrzesnia-1939.html ), 
  it seems they forgot about finland 1939 and poland 1939 . 
  i 'm polish and for us czechs and slovaks are fellows ( not in a russian-style dominating sense ) , despite that you do n't like us that much :p you know , language , culture , mentality are more similar between us than other countries . 
  me too , me too, 
  hearing that frow a fellow czech is painful for me :'(, 
   most men would rape someone if they had the opportunity to holy shit xd i must be somewhat weird , then . 
  i have the same issue . 
  only on / r/europe , though, 
  they are , just like italians . 
  and we are in italy 's anthem also . 
  actually we have the same word in polish i.e. 
  maybe you are right . 
  putin , after all , is a grand master of strategy . 
  but all of his actions more or less go with the spirit of this [ cookbook ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) of russian politics . 
   he 's a very rational player . 
  i have no doubt he will make the right decisions , or at least not take irrational decisions . 
  [ chancellor angela merkel of germany told mr. obama by telephone on sunday that after speaking with mr. putin she was not sure he was in touch with reality , people briefed on the call said . 
  `` in another world , '' she said . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/world/europe/pressure-rising-as-obama-works-to-rein-in-russia.html?hp ), 
  you see , this is european , rational thinking . 
  if polish ca n't understand russian then how the hell you can ? 
  what if that means that now russia have literally nothing to loose exept from invading and stealing goods ? 
  they do n't think like us . 
  i never watch it . 
  it 's as listening to kremlin spokesman . 
  yea tatars are euro-civilised-kebab who is as fundamentally muslimish as contemporary teenagers are catholics !, 
  we [ have them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) in poland too and they are cool , period . 
  they did n't allow polish national television to enter crimea, 
  well it 's pretty much certain that this conflict wo n't go further than ukraine in the foreseeable future . 
  however , today our pm , after meeting with all the opposiotion , previous goverments and presidents announced that the security of poland is weakend . 
  he stated that this conflict have a potential to develop into war that might have unpredictable consecuences for our security . 
  that countries all round the world might get involved and that all must be done to prevent that scenario . 
  on the other hand he stated that tolerance for such actions will only buy time for poland and baltic states becasue we already know this cenario all too well from our history . 
  security measures must be done and military spending have to be dramatically increased . 
  everybody agrees on this . 
  remeber that for us this is not politics but the very existence . 
  besides , what if putin is cod fanboy ? 
  they are already there . 
  [ ` on 18 november 2008 , the nato parliamentary assembly adopted a resolution , urging russia to '' ** respect its commitments ** which were taken at the istanbul osce summit in 1999 and ** withdraw its illegal military presence from the transdnestrian region ** of moldova in the nearest future . 
  ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_army_involvement_in_transnistria ), 
  thanks !, 
  however , we consider these to be polish and not adopted . 
  we on the other hand love hungarians :d despite that we also can say that we 've been opressed by austro-hungary participation in partitions of poland . 
  aha [ makowiec ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poppy_seed_roll ) is also the polish thing :p however it 's not imported from you guys . 
  hahaha, 
  do you know that in poland we also eat gulash , peppers with rice-meat filling and lecho ? 
  of course we know that it all came from you because we have a bit of common kings and history . 
  btw . 
  lecho is one of my favourite foods ever !, 
  yeah , tabloids already write about iii ww looming . 
  i wonder what is the threat to other countries ? 
  how do we know that putin will stop on crimera ? 
  he probably will invade eastern ukraine anytime soon . 
   coming from a country which allowed secret prisons on their territory . 
  i have nothing against that if that will guarantee us troops helping to deter any potential agressors from taking actions on our land . 
  and that was probably one of the main reasons our government allowed that . 
  frankly , there are n't many poles who disagree with this in unofficial , private talks . 
  they will all end up selling counerfeit dolce gabbana bags in barcelona metro though . 
  polish president who died in the [ airplane crash over territory of russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) said something in 2008 ( during russian-georgian war ) that today everybody in the news is reapeating . 
  loosly it 's something like this ` now the georgia , tomorrow ukraine , then maybe baltic states and than , maybe will be my own country ', 
  you are not supposed to post it outside polandball ... just sayin ', 
  we are not safe . 
  us troop presence ends exactly at the oder line . 
  this is one of the main reason why the countries west of us have a luxury to treat russia like a normal partner . 
  i agree with you . 
  for russians cold war has never ended . 
  brits are never to be trusted , that 's for sure . 
  edit : actually nobody shoud be trusted and we should develop our own army . 
  it would be more reasonable to depend on usa than brits , though . 
  i agree with you here . 
  on the other hand let 's just be realistic in this matter . 
  i ca n't see any posibility for this right now as practically every country have slightly different interest . 
  how do you imagine , for example , british , gemran and possibly danish boys dying in mali in the name of french interests . 
  or even worse . 
  let 's just assume that the army will be someday needed to help the police in enforcing the law in some country . 
  how do you imagine german soldiers together with french helping to calm protests in greece or spain . 
  actually i took these two examples from polish tv because that 's , among other things , what was being talked about today . 
  because in eu parliment polish politicians are one of the few that want european army . 
  thay said that this idea is n't very popular one amongs other euro parliment politicians . 
  honestly i do n't know how you could call this understandable while you are far away from any high tectonic activity areas . 
  and what 's more germany is now [ increasing coal mining ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/03/14/germanys-green-energy-disaster-a-cautionary-tale-for-world-leaders/ ) -  quote ' in fact the country will build more coal-fired facilities this year than at any time in the past two decades ' there are also two articles in the economist about it . 
  unfortunaley i could n't find them now but if you whish you can diga little . 
  imho crimea is already lost . 
  the game will now be played to stop this only at this stage . 
  i would n't be so optimistic . 
  in media experts opinion nobady will move a hand if russia would invaided ukraine . 
  in poland and lithuania we are basically afraid now about ourselves . 
   europeans most emphatically demand no such thing .
