  poland and lithuania today have already invoked 4th article of the nato treaty ( direct threat to the integrity and safety of a pact member - and belive me we are very afraid here ) and tommorow emergency nato assembly will take place . 
  but your politicians would not allow it . 
  why ? 
  because they know that without us troops permanently stationed , russians eventually will march westward after all . 
  that 's why poland always goes to missions and supprot us whenever it can . 
  our governments from ! across political spectrum !, 
  constanly hope that someday us will deploy their foreces on our territory . 
  the problem is that the cold war has n't ended for russians . 
  how does that sound to you ? 
  that 's symptomatic for gemrans , who basically owe american troops [ everything ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_days_to_the_river_rhine ) , to show such a great contempt for us . 
  [ ryszard kukli\u0144ski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryszard_kukli%c5%84ski ) was a defector who passed some of those plans to the cia . 
  communist polish state sentenced him to death but ` kukli\u0144ski is buried in the row of honour in the pow\u0105zki military cemetery in warsaw , and he has been given honorary citizenship of several polish cities , including krak\u00f3w and gda\u0144sk . 
  the polish political group centrum ( at the time headed by zbigniew religa ) requested in 2004 that the president of poland posthumously promote kukli\u0144ski to the rank of general . ', 
  now we have a movie [ jack strong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78n-v-gvjju ) in cinemas based on these issues . 
  maybe you do n't know that but polish policy always support usa policy and in this regard we are pretty much at odds with french and germans ( they like to show how greater they are than stupid americans ) obama naively ` reseted ' political relations with russia , effectively abandoning establishment of anti-missile shield and deployment of contingent on the territory of poland . 
  i hope that after syria and recent events policies would return to more firm stand against russian neo-imperial ambitions . 
  maybe usa will finally increase their presence in pl . 
  in the light of recent events i ca n't imagine even slightest opposition . 
  if you do n't support us troops presence , please give some to us !, 
  we always have shortage . 
  edit : it is always funny for me how other westerners are firmly anti-usa , have an utter contempt for us foreign policy while literally living under their military umbrella ( and owe them security and peace for the last ~ 70 years ), 
  do n't think so . 
  after syria and certainly now his view on russia is returning to rational point of view . 
  i 'm sorry mate but you are the grave threat to to prosperity and peace not only to the ukraine but also to the baltic states , sweden , finland and poland . 
  why ca n't you just stick to yourself . 
  you already have a clusterfuck and poverty , wiuld n't it be simpler for everybody if you just try to fix this in your playground ? 
  thankfully it 's only [ 13 thousands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_minority_in_poland ) . 
  so it 's less than 0.1 % . 
  we wanted to have usa anti missle system in pl but naive obama declared ` reset ' in us-ru relations . 
  have you tried it ? 
  if i had been there i would seriously consider it . 
  it 's no joke , i 've tried bugs already . 
  more like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_school ), 
  i would argue if nie is a left wing per se . 
  i would rather consider it a tabloid for retired lower level communist 's regime employees with a great nostalgia for past system . 
  in comparison to them , nie is pure toilet paper . 
  i do not consider myself a right wing . 
  economically i 'm rather liberal minded person with an admiration for austrian economy school . 
  culturally and sexually i 'm certainly liberal . 
  it 's a hoax . 
  the ` action ' was created by a journalist from controversial ` toilet-paper ' journal nie . 
  he wanted to check if animal shelters will try to sell animals instead of putting them out if necessry . 
  unfortunately ecologists and major newspapers found out and made a case before the any shady animal shelter was exposed . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://natemat.pl/93543,chca-skupowac-psy-i-koty-na-kilogramy-szczyt-glupoty-czy-prowokacja-sprawa-zajmie-sie-prokuratura ) it was a hoax made up by journalist from a ` toilet-paper provocative ' newspaper nie . 
  vietnamiese are the most represented asians . 
  they probably do n't eat dogs , though . 
  too bad it 's hard to get them in pl . 
  : / seems that i 'll have to wait for an occasion . 
  imho poland is the only nation , historically conected with baltic sea , that does n't adore salmiakki like others around here . 
  and like [ polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_government-in-exile ) , which officialy passed it 's competencies to democratically elected government after we regained independance in 1989 . 
  remainder : communist government of poland was established with the voilation of the law , help of russian tanks and falcified referendum . 
  in terms of [ total firepower ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/ ) it 's second just after usa, 
  currently the most respected international laws are tanks and bombs, 
  wooo , i love salmiakki !, 
  never was aware that such a liquor exist , though . 
  now i have another must-try thing . 
  mad dog shot , would be a [ polish one ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6bhp-zrop0c/thxcvbk3jgi/aaaaaaaaae4/myivmhkhj2c/s1600/790554.jpg ) ( i did n't make it ), 
  i love bbc horizon and science documentaries, 
  this is brilliant !, 
  lithuania stronk !, 
  people and state are two different things down there, 
  they deserve to get a big dose of freedom from nato forces :d, 
  in poland it a criminal offence ( needles to say immoral behaviour ) as would be erection of monument of hitler and as such it is prosecuted automatically by state . 
  thankfully we have some good laws here , 
  certainly we did defend ourselves and took some revenge , no doubt about that . 
  but the sheer scale , methods and political idea of upa of cleaning those land of polish minoryty were outrageous and demand at least some small efforts of good will . 
  and we did apologiesed for operation vistula ( it was ethnic cleansing but without killing i.e. 
  forced resattlement , by the way ) anyway i think that the future prospects look good , despite minor differences . 
   yes . 
  people changed their attitude towards politicians in general . 
  and catcalled her when she started talking about the things people did n't believe anymore . 
  let 's just hope that people wo n't be succumbed into easily graspable , plausable right wing extremists views . 
  despite great support for ukraine [ massacres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia ) of poles in volhynia are very well rememberd across the political spectrum in poland . 
  the consensus is to not mention it now very much in order to not give the russia an opportunity to antagonise our nations more . 
  but we hope that you will someday do something symbolic , like erect a monument or pass some law that will condemnt it . 
  well , certainly something like that would n't even cross anybody 's mind in poland . 
  it would be comparable to displaying a big swastika on hypothetical izraeli olympics to highlight a history of izraeli people ... edit : spelling, 
  ah yea that would make sense now . 
  not many chinese here , i think . 
  i hate that too but do we have any other serious political parties ? 
  i was hoping that some gowin-republikanie-etc . 
  party will start but now it seems that the energy and political will disappeard . 
  and palikot and sld , this is a joke of a dead man . 
  it 's good that you have the same view on communism and ussr as roughly ~ 98 % of polish population . 
  an ukrainian aquaintance of mine menioned that despite being broadly supportet ( not enthisuastically ) she probably will not get elected due to the peoples need to have someone ` clean ' and new . 
  i do n't know if these are widespread opinions or not but yesterday i have seen that see was n't that well received by maidan as was anticipated in poland, 
  i doubt that the debate will actually take place . 
  pm on the conference already stated that if the debate happen he does n't see any point in participation of oher parties than main opposiotion . 
  and i suppose the main opposition party leader could not disagree . 
  i agree with you . 
  it was all about ukraine this week but was anything more important for us than that ? 
  i suppose not . 
  when i saw it on the ceremony my jaw dropped . 
  apparently it went smoothly through all media everywhere , it seems . 
  just google graphics ` sochi hammer and sickle ' edit : this is [ the best picture ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/sochi020714/s21_50282667.jpg ) from the atlantic i 've found so far, 
  we are very happy for you people and most young people watch it and wish you good luck !!, 
  [ troll exposed ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/russias-online-comment-propaganda-army/280432/ ) . 
  if this is a definiotion of a fasist country than it 's a country of my dreams and where i do like to live in . 
  so i see that chinese constructors have forseen all posibilities and tried to prevendthem i every possible way  that 's clever . 
  nevertheless i whish you chinese people the same moment one day ,
