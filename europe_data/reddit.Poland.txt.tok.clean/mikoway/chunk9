  read [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror ) edit : and most imporantly [ lenin 's hanging order ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenin%27s_hanging_order ) which clearly shows that he is personaly responsible for mas killings and atrocities, 
  you should n't be surprised if you saw this year 's [ olympic opening ceremony ] ( http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/32/21/3221227f538abb91b69d1123157d8091.jpg?itok=pe5suiok ), 
  is [ this ] ( http://thecontributor.com/sites/default/files/resize/breaking-news/2013/08/gay-russia-3-400x401.jpg ) close ? 
  all of those thing are true . 
  you should put the same law as we have in poland which forbids promotion imigies and ideology of nazism and communism, 
  in poland it is criminally forbiden to erect the lenin monument , promote communism or nazism . 
  it does n't have to be , since there are virtually no poles who would do such a disgracefull thing . 
  seriously , are you paid by kremlin or something ? 
  edit : [ russia 's online-comment propaganda army ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/russias-online-comment-propaganda-army/280432/ ), 
  lenin personally ordered those thing . 
  this is common knowledge . 
  beautiful , 
  that 's interesting to know . 
  when i was in lviv with my grandpa ( he lived there before iiwr ) and once i heard people speak russian , insted of ukrainian which is common there , it was my grandpa who told me that they actually spoke in different language . 
  i can not hear the difference :(, 
  sorry for interruption but it should be mfa - minister of foreign affairs, 
  his wife is jewish so i guess that you missed, 
  do not forgot that yanukowich was a convict felon and thus this shall shed some light on his behaviour and lack of dicency, 
  [ very drastic , people shot by government snipers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ifxshedx0#t=63 ), 
  [ that titushky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titushky ), 
  it 's similar in with my friends . 
  in poland most people use [ wykop ] ( www.wykop.pl ) , including me . 
  [ russian guy xd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqay_isvpj8 ), 
  yeah ` friends ' started spamming my wall with this , like a week ago . 
  but fortunately it 's not as bad as is in the teenagers circles . 
  there is a frenzy going on, 
  that very well may be but i ca n't imagine relaxing , reading , and playing on the phone while squatting ... 
  that poland lay in central europe , i assume . 
  ha ha ha and i thought it was about polish tourists in barcelona :d, 
  what is this about :d ? 
  what the hell i saw this guy :d and he was wearing white-ish / beige old suit :d, 
  i was always taught in schools that poland lay in [ central europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ), 
  in poland younger people sometimes call krak\u00f3w - krk [ ka-\u0259r-ka ], 
  this \u0144 is more or less similar to spanish \u00f1 sound but shorter , 
  polan stronk !, 
  we only use them while visiting someone in hospital, 
  same here , unless the host tell you to do otherwise . 
  same in poland . 
  i encountered this in ukraine , as well as squatting toilets . 
  that was really off puting . 
  well , yea germany may be at the centre of the eu but poland borders 8 ( i counted sweden ) and is the centre of geographical europe . 
  btw . 
  does that really matter ? 
  i was in troki , kaunas and wilno  very beautiful and in wilno everybody knows polish little bit , 
  wow , they really do have different meanings . 
  i have never thought about it in that way . 
  but anyway thanks for coorrecting me , i frequently make these missspelings ... 
  yes and personally i find falgs with coat of arm way cooler . 
  but you can say without risk that russia is seen in poland generally as an enemy country . 
  and the actions of russians oficials are pretty much always viewed with suspitions of ill intentions . 
  having said that , i must add that , though i did n't meet many russians , i do feel a little intimidated by their unpredictibility and agressive tendencies . 
  i personally do n't consider those things as upsides ( maybe with an exception of defeing us , on the other hand i would rather deal with us in a german style , predictable , and law-based way ), 
  why is there no poland in [ that ] ( http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/good-enough-to-eat ) ranking xd ? 
  but recently some uk official announcced that whoever join syrian rebels or other muslim extremist organisation will be stripped of british nationality and all welfare benefits . 
  edit : maybe that will force them to rethink . 
  do you think it will have some effect ? 
  i do n't suspect that those converts recruit from well educated , financially stable families . 
  omg , once i saw a movie on liveleak from dagestan . 
  i saw what these savages did to your soldiers . 
  it was very very disturbing . 
  maybe musilm terrorists will after all do some good o us . 
  and what i mean by this is to finally reconcile russia with nations of europe . 
  finally create pan-europeano-american alliance against world kebabisation . 
  in poland we also have middle name . 
  but not everybody has one and what 's more important it 's normal unmodified name , not patronim . 
  it 's usually given after someone who was important for parents . 
  it can be agrandfather or a favourite writer . 
  aha and althought that name is never mentioned in any official documents or in general speech , it 's in the id card . 
  some people who do n't like their original name , tellpeople to call them by their middle name , but again that 's vary rare . 
  honelsty , what do you expect from muslim extremists ? 
  just pray that this time allies wo n't be the germany . 
  we are all doomed then :d, 
  i 've been to lviv 3 times , first was i belive about 7 years ago . 
  it 's the city of my grandpas birth . 
  what i saw there was just sad . 
  massive poverty . 
  last time i was there was year ago , so it was already after the euro and so-called fast infrastuructal development . 
  outside the centre nothing has changed . 
  and the minds of ukrainians are the same . 
  i know that because i was in a ukrainian house of my grandpas co-worker 's family . 
  well , honestly i prefer equal partnership in a relationship , when a couple share chores . 
  personally i prefer to cook becasue i like it . 
  but there is a difference between manly chavette woman without sophisticaion with high demands and the woman who is educated , well behaved and can talk with you calmly about equal rights and her expectations in the relationship . 
  i only mingle with people from higher education / acdemic background so i do n't have such problems but sometimes you have to interact with these other woman . 
  it 's just horrible how self-absorbed and interested in stupid things like hair and make up they can be . 
  yea , end were were the only country that tolerated protestants , catholics , orthodox and others . 
  what 's more interesting poland was the first pre-democracy in europe i.e. 
  nobilty elected the king and it was done in times of absolutism europe . 
  sadly it turned out to weaken our commonwealth but it 's anoher story ... 
  pity is was done over my country . 
  bastrards :p next time , ask . 
  i think poland will gladly let you pass over in attack russia if you want to . 
  just do n't froget to camp army in our hotels and buy our delicious local goods during an offensive . 
  and keep away from our women you teutons !, 
  do you think you could comunicate with poles or chechs ? 
  i heard that sorbian has features that put in sort of in between czech and polish . 
  i would say the same about ukrainian woman . 
  ( femen does n't count - it 's a margin ), 
  i do n't have any source but it 's widely known that russian and ukrainian women suffer the lack of good husband material . 
  it 's quite hard to meet the guy who has ambitions , do n't drink , has finished a degree and has some level of sophistication and is n't backward .
