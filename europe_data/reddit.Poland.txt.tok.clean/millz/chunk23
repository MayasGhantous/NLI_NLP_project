  out of which , 90 % are western eu companies , who should know better . 
  if you 're an unskilled migrant , learn the language and get a marketable skill . 
  blaming uber for giving them opportunities is so 19th century marxism it does n't even warrant a response . 
  no , the main innovation is having a simple app that integrates ordering , localisation , payment and feedback . 
  oh , and also actually having a pleasant trip , in a almost new car and a driver that does n't think he 's the smartest shit alive , even though he only finished primary school . 
  not to mention taxis are known to be fraudulent across the entire world , in poland they often tamper with mileage sensors and also rarely give receipts . 
  let me get this straight - a bunch of vigilantes block the road to the most important public service in the capitol of portugal , attacking innocent people and damaging expensive property . 
  the police allow them to continue the assaults , not only de facto stating these criminals are above the property and assault law , but also able to blackmail the entire economy and bring millions , if not billions , of losses just to keep their sad , pitiful monopoly . 
  if this is the state of modern europe then i 'd gladly go back to 19th century , back then property laws were at least sometimes enforced , and if not you could always shoot the assailant without fearing backlash from the left and years of imprisonment , due to our bastardized self-defence laws . 
  i really think police should start indiscriminately shooting these criminals , especially since this is another wave of anti-uber violence that has already caused extensive damage both to property and human life . 
  they are getting more and more cocky in their attempts , and no state can allow such vitriolic group to blackmail them . 
  it 's actually a standard tradeoff in combustion engines - either more co2 or more no2 . 
  from medical point of view no2 is much more dangerous though . 
  yes , it 's similar in poland - if you 're ` duty to the polish army ' is fulfilled ( it 's an old law , back from the draft times , basically means you need to do your conscription service first ) and you have the permission of the ministry of defence , then you are good to go . 
  afaik this does n't apply to mercenaries though , and since isis is not recognized by poland , you are still treated as a mercenary . 
  of course they have better sources , they are an intelligence agency after all . 
  what you take for granted , though , is their morality and the fact they would not support jihadists to reach whatever goals they have . 
  captain state helping the citizens with regulations once again !, 
  no , but virtually all new developments must provide flats that are later used for council housing , effectively reducing the supply of homes for middle-class in an already crowded city . 
  no , i just have successful integration stories of people who have put the effort into it and succeeded - you know , the millions of intra-eu migrants who are working in different eu countries . 
  and then i have daily news stories from illegals , who protest that their allowances are too small , their internet too slow and the winter too cold , and the towns too quiet . 
  all coming from people supposedly fleeing war . 
  what i meant is that there hundreds of thousands of migrants , who even if they have access to these services , do n't use it or do n't even know they can use it - and still manage to integrate well . 
  if you do n't put any effort into integration given those extraordinary circumstances which previous generations could only dream of , that just means you are not interested in integration , you 're only interested in benefit payments and handouts and staying in your backwards culture in self-made ghettos . 
  you mean the cia , who has been known to torture people , including their own citizens , lie about weapons of mass destruction , ` drone ' ` enemies of the state ' from across the world and , most importantly , has been involved in dozens coups against democratically elected governments around the world ? 
  well , this is the first bbc article i 've read that actually ends with a common sense argument , not some leftist guilt-inducing mumbo-jumbo : `` with so many of them saying they do n't feel swedish , perhaps the bigger question is : has integration and sweden 's experiment with multiculturalism failed ? '', 
  and then you have millions of intra-eu migrants , myself included , who do n't have access to free housing , language lessons or any of that stuff and yet still manage to integrate quickly , find a job and become a valuable member of the society . 
  maybe , unlike what marx and huffington post says , people really are different , hmm ? 
  rent-controlled apartments are an absurd thing that only drives the legitimate market shortage and keeps the prices high for the middle class . 
  similar thing is happening in london with mandatory quotas for council houses in new developments , but on much higher scales , and eventually will lead to a city where only benefit-takers and rich folks will be able to live . 
  how hard is to take an economics 101 class to understand state market intervention always distorts the market and is never a good option in the long-run ? 
  i have a hard time understanding the motives of the states doing this . 
  in my homeland , poland , there is a law explicitly stating being part of a foreign army or a mercenary is a crime and you can get up to 8 years of prison for that . 
  i personally knew a person , who was arrested and was in jail for 3 years for serving in the french foreign legion . 
  i 'm pretty sure most countries have similar laws . 
  why are n't they enforced ? 
  not to mention , that if they know about these jihadis , they surely have some evidence of their terrorist acts , which are also punishable in any jurisdiction . 
  renewables are not better than nuclear energy , they are actually orthogonal , as they will never provide base load power . 
  germany shot itself in foot with declaration of closure of their nuclear plants , as they will have to increase burning of coal ( and this is brown coal , which is much more polluting ) to meet their ever increasing power demand . 
  uk is in the process of building new nuclear stations as we speak . 
  they are not putin 's puppets willingly , but nevertheless he uses them to his means . 
  and i 'm not the kind of guy who blames everything on papa putin , but this actually can be blamed on him . 
  there was a journalist investigation in some of the ` green ' groups in poland few years ago that uncovered constant stream of money from moscow . 
  exactly , the proponents of eurozone are mainly politicians , not economists . 
  they have their own ideological/political goals that are independent of whether it is good for greece , germany or sweden . 
  we 've had the same problem in poland . 
  last government , po , was pushing eurozone very intensely ( often using demagogical arguments like ` countries outside of eurozone do n't really count in the eu ' ) , although pretty much every mainstream economist thought it was either a bad idea in general , or at least should be postponed until more convergence is reached . 
  then the 2008 crisis came and guess what ? 
  the independence of pln allowed us to remain the only country with positive gdp growth and our quick recovery was also direct result of that . 
  i 'm not sure it ever stopped being one , it just had an incompetent president ( yeltsin ) for some time . 
  the pro-abortion bill apparently violated several articles of polish constitution and that 's why it was rejected . 
  funny fact : the bill would have passed if the whole po and nowoczesna clubs voted for it - but they did n't . 
  pis also did n't wholly vote against it , so it 's really crocodile tears from nowoczerska . 
  another fun fact : during latest rejection of the ` stop abortion ' bill , pis voted for the rejection , while po and nowoczesna voted to keep the legislature in progress !, 
  did you hear about it in your local leftist newspaper ? 
  of course not . 
  pretty sure somebody does . 
  anyway , in such cases they also aim for the heart as to minimize the damage to animals skin . 
  people also miss the point that the bill gathered 500k signatures , more than twice the amount the liberalisation one and five times more than the number of protesters on monday . 
  apparently the liberalisation project was incompatible with several points of polish constitution and this point has already been discussed with the lawyers . 
  yes , hunters normally go for the heart , so the animal dies as quickly as possible . 
  longer struggle spoils the meat and a wounded running animal needs to be tracked . 
  that 's hardly any insulation , the main exit point of heat is walls and basement . 
  proper insulation of a mid-sized house is a cost of at least $ 10k . 
  replacing windows is probably a similar cost as well . 
  obviously , it 'd be good to build with these standards in the first place , unfortunately a large part of housing infrastructure in europe is old . 
  i actually did quite a lot of philosophy of science . 
  the cornerstone of science is empirism and falsifiability , both of which result in a verifiable experimental setting , which can be reproduced and checked independently . 
  these ` non-experimental research ' ideas are simply quackery invented by psychologists to make it seem they are doing science . 
  please , do tell me , would any hard scientist accept a theory which basis lies entirely on interpretation of some phenomena by a single scientist , without any backing data or experiments , and most importantly which are unreproducible ? 
  of course not , that 's why psychology truly is quackery and is the only field where ` non-experimental research ' is accepted . 
  `` non-experimental research is the label given to a study when a researcher can not control , manipulate or alter the predictor variable or subjects , but instead , relies on ** interpretation , observation or interactions to come to a conclusion ** . '', 
  the burden of proof is on you , not the other way around . 
  all of which are also massively costly . 
  there is a point to this , but you can not reasonably argue that the tiny number of european colonialists ( at the beginning there were max couple thousands ) were able to enslave and murder 8 million people . 
  i understand your point too , as calling transgenderism a ` disease ' ( from medical point of view ) has negative layman connotations , ie . 
  that we should ` cure ' it - which is not my point at all , as you also can not - and should not - ` cure ' other ` diseases ' like left-handness or synesthesia . 
   their actions are well intended , but they are not capable of seeing past their idealogical dogmas . 
  while i agree with you , this can not absolve them from responsibility . 
  i 'm pretty sure hitler 's actions were well-intended from his point of view ( creation of a better man , etc. 
  ) , while still being objectively wrong and immoral . 
  ~ ~ marx ~ ~ engels did state that ` nations must perish in the revolutionary holocaust ' . 
  he most certainly knew his ideas will lead to massive deaths and social unrest . 
  all civilisations in americas had slaves before . 
  hell , they even sacrificed them by thousands . 
  the absolute vast majority of deaths in americas were caused by new pathogens . 
  do you hold china responsible for the black death ? 
  because that 's where bubonic plague originated from . 
  so are you saying that communist genocidal crimes were actually result of mismanagement of previous , feudal systems ? 
  do you know about the holodomor , the great leap forward or the cultural revolution ? 
  are you claiming these were not direct result of either pure and organized malice or complete idiocy , that characterized all communist systems ? 
  yes , both can be traced back to mutation in neanderthals . 
  scientific method - a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century , consisting in systematic observation , measurement , and ** experiment ** , and the formulation , testing , and modification of hypotheses . 
  please do tell me about all these unfalsifiable ` scientific theories ' . 
  it 's either a mutation , an epigenetic change or hormonal imbalance during development period - or a combination of all these . 
  according to simon baron-cohen , one of the leading scientists in the field of developmental psychopathology , it 's mostly hormonal imbalance during pregnancy . 
  he talks about this and his research on newborn babies ( who already have ` gender roles ' ingrained in them , and predicted by testosterone levels in womb , contrary to the gender theory view ) in [ this documentary . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5lrdw8xw70 ) blue eyes are definitely a recessive mutation and a defect , they have been traced back to ancient neanderthal populations . 
  however , due to environmental changes they do n't have detrimental effects associated with them in hotter climates , where natural selection would weed them out ( eye cancer , etc. ) . 
  first humans were probably dark skinned and dark eyed , while whiter skin and lighter eyes developed after migration to europe .
