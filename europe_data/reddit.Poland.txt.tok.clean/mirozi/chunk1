silly hungary , you have language literally from outer space *** and *** you use china as expression if gibberish/not understanding ? 
  oh , go grab some maerzen and go watch some benny hill . 
  more perkele , perkele !, 
  i hope that i remember what perkele means , perkele . 
  interesting . 
  thanks for that . 
  do you know why it 's france ? 
  looking at your history i would assume that you have closer nations you could choose for this saying . 
  yep , albanian mafia is driving them , but since top gear 's visit it 's changing , 
  we have similar phrase in polish , `` siedzie\u0107 jak na tureckim kazaniu '' ( `` sitting like on turkish preach/lecture '' ) , what basically means that you do n't understand nothing from what others are saying . 
  edit : added direct translation . 
  are n't parisians even worse ? 
  like french ^ ( 2 ) ? 
  / r/european is extreme on the other side . 
  sure it 's not perfect , but is not as bad as they are showing . 
  sure , i have some problems with what is happening in some places in europe , i would be much more strict here and there , but they are portraying everything as inherently bad . 
  `` visit poland , your car is already here '', 
  i think that in some countries political correctness is taken too seriously . 
  sure , i 'm sometimes pissed when someone is attacking others in jokes , but in many cases it 's just normal joking based on stereotypes ( like we are mocking differences between polish and czech . 
  it 's not because we do n't like them , quite contrary ) . 
  it 's funny that americans are making jokes from canadians based on stereotypes it 's ok , but if you do similar thing inside europe it 's bad and racist . 
  i could agree with you in 2008 , or hell , even in mid 2010 , but when nokia 's sells dropped they should think `` we have superior hardware , but people are buying this android devices , maybe we should try it in our flagship phone ? '' . 
  but no , they were like `` we sell less phones , we should stick to symbian for a while and in meantime let 's put all eggs into one basket and create our own os '' . 
  sure , but nokia could do the same back then , but they sticked to symbian like to lifeboat . 
  we had android 4.0 when they crapped out last symbian phone . 
  i will be brutally honest here , people would swallow `` nokia powered by android '' like young pelicans . 
  it was the most recognizable phone company back then , it needed smart decisions , even with slight delay . 
  it 's like telling that bada would be first choice for samsung . 
  wave series was side project for samsung , maemo for nokia , as a main system , was shot to the knee . 
  yep , 95 and 98 octane , diesel , lpg and very , very , very rarely cng ( mostly in big cities where buses are using it ) . 
  i never encountered one without both of them .

  mvp in polish league in 2012 . they both played together in asseco resovia rzesz\u00f3w for 2 years . 
  edit : very late word added . 
  i would say that men 's league in poland is in top3 in the world . 
  definitely russia have money and italy have `` fame '' , but italian league have many , many problems in recent years , especially with money , when teams in poland are pretty stable . 
  and the best part is , contrary to other teams , there is no beef between poland and germany national teams . 
  we respect each other and many german players were/are playing in poland ( grozer , schoeps , tille and many more ) . 
  [ here 's small talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfbctxsnuf0 ) between grozer and ignaczak ( in broken english from ig\u0142a and great polish from grozer ) . 
  they played together for 3 years ( if memory serves me well ) in resovia . 
  to be honest , we are pretty good in volleyball . 
  not the first major win in international tournament in recent years ( with some pretty big failures in the meantime ) . 
  i think there is one more thing . 
  in animated movies you can put more `` inside jokes '' specific for particular countries , where in regular movies you have to stick more to theme of the movie . 
  not in every case , especially in `` adult animations '' ( like south park ) , but for instance shrek , or penguins of madagascar are open season for creative writers/translators . 
  but for czechs everything with our voice over , or dubbing will be funny :p, 
  you have just bad imagination . 
  i do n't like friends . 
  for me it 's mediocre at most . 
  but i do n't like this type of sitcoms . 
  it was long ago  and i never watched harry potter movie . 
  ever . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ok , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ watched ^ ^ ^ ^ it , ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ subtitles . 
  it 's not entirely correct . 
  in some countries it 's bit more complicated . 
  in poland movies in tv have voice over , but animated movies and movies for childrens have dubbing ( like shrek for instance , with the best dubbing ever ) . 
  from the other hand , movies in cinemas have mostly subtitles , sometimes voice over ( i think harry potter had voice over ) and every movie aimed for childrens have full dubbing . 
  report it then . 
  or downvote . 
  nogdam 's souvenirs from sweden - eleven light bulbs . 
  we can really argue about crimea , but from international law pov what russia is doing is just bad . 
  for now it should be internal ukrainian problem and russia never should send troops to crimea ( at least until everything was resolved ) . 
  we have to agree that giving crimea to ukraine was legal action ( no matter how bad this government is in your eyes ) . 
   ( just to compare : languages of ethnic minorities are official in the regions of russia where those minorities live ) . 
  yep , russian tartars can confirm !, 
  second thing , if you do n't know , it was autonomus republic since 1992 . 
  if they wanted to keep crimea , why they gave it away ? 
  it was n't loan , it 's not like `` hey , here you have this part of land , we will take it back in 60 years '' . 
   you see , the `` separatists '' in ukraine are n't actually separatists , they are people like you and me . 
  that still does n't mean that they are not separatists . 
  * a person who advocates or seeks the splitting of one country or territory into two politically independent countries or territories . 
   the people are actually fighting against the ukrainian state military as they were sick of being treated badly by the government . 
  this is bullshit and you know it . 
  real reason is that government change from pro-russian . 
   especially when you relise that ukrainians are actually russian to some extent . 
  yep , belarusians too . 
  this does n't change anything , because they are not russians . 
   the reasons for this are the fall of the soviet union . 
  if we go with that reasons many countries should n't even exist . 
  but we agreed that they are there . 
   lets say for example that you live in montreal . 
  and all of a sudden , the region goes independent and the region you live in is now called france . 
  exactly that happening ** now ** in ukraine . 
  part of ukraine just tells that they are part of russia . 
   further to this , the russian people who live in the region have a genuine claim that eastern ukraine is actually russia . 
  and if we go with this trail poland have claims on lviv ( and western ukraine ) ... and chicago  the us were trying to gain control of the russian naval base which is situated in the crimea ( formally the soviet union ) . 
  so the us installed a government which would take control of the naval base . 
   since the crimea has `` ascended '' and not `` annexed '' ... the us has no other interest in ukraine . . other than allowing monsanto and dupont to buy up land for agriculture and farming ... this belongs to / r/conspiracy  however since 70 % of the people living there were actually russian , putin called for a vote , and guess what ? 
  the russians voted to go with russia . . so now votes are enough to change borders and then send troops ? 
  once again , chicago to poland !, 
   so ... from now on , america has no further interest in ukraine , and recently merkel ( head of the eu ) has said that ukraine can now join russia if it feels like it . . this is utter lie . 
  or you do n't know how to read . 
  merkel is not head of the eu . 
  and she did n't tell ukraine can join russia , but '' russia 's `` eurasian union '' '' and the rest belongs to / r/conspiracy too . 
  first of all , eu is not military organization . 
  they ca n't send troops wherever they want , because they do n't have authority to do that .
