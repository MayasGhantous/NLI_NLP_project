  i know exactly what i wrote , but maybe you should check what you did . 
  mate , what are you even talking about ? 
  that 's what i 'm talking about when i 'm talking about twisting my words . 
  you are projecting your own insecurities onto me . 
  you try to spin critique of your country against me , but it 's not working - you are only confirming all stereotypes about ` muricans , especially about your famous `` thick skin '' . 
  of course i responded in condescending tone . 
  because for everyone in the whole world when we talk about `` maternity leave '' it 's obvious that we are talking about paid maternity leave ... but not for you . 
  for everyone else it 's obvious when we are talking about unemployment benefits we are not talking about some twisted regulations like you have in some of your states where you can be sack off and left to starve to death . 
  maybe i actually know more about your country than you think and in the end you ca n't handle criticism ? 
  that 's what propaganda does to you . 
  what 's next ? 
  maybe like other ` muricans thinking they are smart you will tell me that my health care is not actually free but i pay for it with taxes ? 
  yeah , i do n't know either . 
  you ca n't even take simple criticism of your country without twisting words and calling everyone `` rude and smug '' you nationalistic ` murican . 
  yeah , and i have gold ingots , just not from real gold . 
  even simple things like death penalty . 
  and mandatory paid time leave . 
  maternity leave . 
  unemployment benefits . 
  really , really simple things . 
  everyone has an accent . 
  no matter what . 
  rp is accent by itself , but i 'm not sure if everyone in england see it as `` neutral '' . 
  would n't it be more like yorkshire ( ish ) accent ? 
  i 'm pulling your leg , mate . 
  op asked about team sports , 
  such team , much sport . 
  or is it synchronised swimming ? 
  not as catchy as sas , innit ? 
   so saying that is uncalled for man . 
  i upvoted you , but it 's not uncalled for . 
  sorry my friend , but it 's not elementary school , it 's grown up world - we have to look at accomplishments , not good will of small part of population . 
  i can pat your back as a person ( considering your views ) , but as american ... 
   i mean we ca n't do anything about our corrupt politicians representing rich special interest groups i mean ... you live in democracy , do n't you ? 
  literally called in polish [ miracle on vistula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_%281920%29?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  quite important battle that many people outside of poland do n't even know about . 
  edit : a letter, 
  moar stars , this post needs moar stars \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605, 
  you are not making trip `` full '' by crossing things from a checklist . 
  i ( and from threads all over the place - many people ) really do n't get that kind of trips . 
   i hope you do n't mind waiting an hour for every packet you order . 
  whole hour ? 
  and do you want to risk deportation ? 
  good luck ... 
  quite contrary , mate , quite contrary . 
  ^ ( / s if it 's not obvious , because recently i was downvoted for cliche like that ), 
  probably for the same reason that they would be discriminated in most other non-english speaking countries . 
  those names often suggest that parents are not ... 
  the brightest , to put it politely . 
  f1 to some degree , more in the past due to kubica . 
  and in some regions speedway is quite popular . 
  and drift is gaining traction . 
  gy\u00f6rgy gr\u00f3zer , especially after first season in resovia . 
  i may , or may be not biased . 
  because you hit the nail in the head : '' ` murica big '' , `` our states are like european countries '' and `` no , i never left country '' . 
  and i do n't poke you because you do n't have means to travel , but because you fit perfectly into sas stereotypes . 
  but ... soda and pop !, 
  and ny pizza and chicago pizza !,

  your point being ? 
   dangerous dangerous ? 
  stupid ? 
  ignorant ? 
  yes . 
  yeah ... 
  i could guess as much . 
  why am i even surprised ? 
  out of curiosity , what other countries you visited ? 
  for me ketchup is , basically , watered down tomato paste with spices . 
  for instance one of the most popular brand has special `` ketchup for children '' that is quite sweet , but regular ketchup is not really sweet . 
  it 's somewhat vicious circle . 
  people are buying lower quality products , or products catered to `` local tastes '' , so they are still selling it . 
  you are projecting ` murican ketchup on ours . 
  there is nothing sweet in ketchup . 
  because , according to the law , i had too high speed for those weather conditions . 
  i called 112 ( or more precisely 997 - police ) only once , when i had an accident . 
  there was black ice on the road , i lost control over the car , landed in the ditch , so i called the police to inform them about that ( and they informed firefighters , so they cleaned the `` scene '' from car fluids and broken glass ) . 
  yeah , i got minimal ticket , too ( 100 pln = ~ 25 $ ) . 
  23/11pm or it 's opened 24h . 
  you have to be more precise , because it depends on location . 
  so ... you are saying that your 10 times bigger city has not even two times more teams ? 
  what examples , exactly ? 
  in the closest city to me ( population ~ 170k ) , counting only professional teams there are : two football teams , volleyball team , speedway team and basketball team . 
  if we start counting semi-professional teams this number will go drastically up . 
  and we are talking about one of the smallest `` big cities '' in poland . 
  and for your edit : you totalled ~ 150 teams in american football in usa . 
  that 's smaller number than teams in highest division in 8 european countries ( averaging around 20 ) . 
  you are talking about population density in europe , but you do n't take into account number of teams at all ... 
  but her wiki page says she is american ... oh , wait . 
  she is `` armenian '' . 
  wow , four teams in metro area ? 
  sorry for being sarcastic , but it clearly shows disparity here . 
  and few teams in one city . 
  population density means nothing if you have one team in state vs one/multiple team ( s ) in a city . 
   i think it 's quite hyperbolic to state that it 's american culture to fear the police and respect soldiers no matter what . 
  is it really hyperbolic if many people repeat `` do n't talk to cops even if you did n't do anything wrong '' ? 
  or that in certain schools children are taught how to safely talk with cops ? 
  or that you have cops stationed in some schools ? 
  similarly no matter the state , red or blue one , vets have special treatment , from minor ones , to pretty big ones . 
  and we are not even talking about dod propaganda , which is huge topic even in itself .
