  but our police , last time i checked , had approval around 70 % . 
  i think they stopped living in anyone 's shadow some time ago . 
  by respect for cops you mean `` fear '' and by respect for soldiers you mean `` soldiers are heroes no matter what they do '' ? 
  no , i do n't think we need that . 
  * unusually * ? 
  no , not really . 
  it 's rather par for the course right now . 
  it 's generally weird , but fluctuations like that are common in late april/early may . 
  you have to take into account that city sprawl in usa and europe looks quite differently and often people have much closer connection to specific part of the city and not the city as a whole . 
  but that 's not the reason why i 'm putting them in different categories and you know it . 
  biedronka in poland is go-to shop for many people , but they still do n't brand themselves as `` supermarket '' , but `` discount '' . 
  it 's not * what * you can buy there , but how . 
  maybe it 's our thing in poland ( or maybe it 's my bias ) , but we definitely would n't put `` discount shops '' and supermarkets in the same category . 
  in other words : i would n't put shops like lidl in `` supermarket '' category . 
  but this shift is not new . 
  and is not surprising , because average person needs to spend more and more time in education and this just reflects that . 
  and back in my days ... 
  etc , etc. 
  you are trying to push standards that may not work in this day and age . 
  are some parents overprotective ? 
  sure . 
  but that 's about only thing i can agree with you from your whole post . 
  [ ekhem ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhetorical_questions ) . 
   most of the attendees at the nfl are native citizens of england . 
  and compare those numbers to viewership of average football weekend . 
  it 's extremely easy to inflate numbers on rare events . 
   germany has an american football league with matches averaging a few hundred in attendance to sometimes a few thousand . 
  same in poland . 
  and yet i 've met one person in my whole life that knew anything about american football , or had any interest in it . 
   for 20 years there was nfl europa with many teams in germany like munich , hamburg , dusseldorf , frankfurt with attendance of 20,000 to 40,000 for each match . 
  i wonder why there 's `` was '' not `` is '' . 
  do n't you ? 
  first - expats , second - novelty . 
  high attendance in two matches means nothing . 
   also germans like american football too . 
  yeah ... about that ... 
  you still do n't get it ? 
  credit score is credit score , bank 's assessment if you can get loan , or your collateral is big enough is not credit score . 
  nope . 
  there is national agency that tracks unpaid loans/other types of liability , but it 's not credit score . 
  people , for god sake , it 's not the same thing . 
  checking if there is unpaid loan = / = credit score . 
  that 's ... dumb . 
  why would i want to ~ ~ spend ~ ~ waste so much time in school ? 
  i had better things to do . 
  it depends . 
  it 's probably one of the first st. andrew 's church in poland , but definitely not in the world ( since it 's not dedicated to a local saint ) . 
  depends how far we want to go . 
  in my town ( without specifying anything ) there is a church from 1368 . 
  but it 's generally quite hard question , because , obviously , many old buildings were repaired , or even partially rebuilt . 
  but if we take this into account and count only buildings that were used constantly ( so are not archaeological findings ) we would look at buildings from xi century - maybe [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._andrew%27s_church%2c_krak%c3%b3w?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  and even on top of that we could add some older `` structures '' . 
  but 200 % and day off . 
  at least there 's that . 
  you have to have really bad employer , you have to be unlucky and work in excluded trade/industry , or be self-employed . 
  no , he is from poland . 
  we were n't really hit as much as other countries . 
  nope . 
  dzie\u0144 \u015bwira is much , much better depiction of our culture ( maybe slightly better in depicting it when it was released , but there is still way too many truths there ) . 
  and seksmisja is still great comedy , 
  there can only be one answer - [ dzie\u0144 \u015bwira ] ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0330243/ ) . 
   succeed if they want , yeah ... 
  i 'm not sure it 's word you tried to use . 
  but that tells more about you . 
  and blue states , indeed , should succeed . 
  and probably will thanks to your agent orange president . 
  no one will vote republican after this idiot . 
  in theory - no , because it 's illegal to `` promote '' any totalitarian form of government . 
  but i would say that communists have slightly more leeway than nazis ( but in this day and age it 's slightly murky ) . 
   because you are unaware of instances where it happens . 
  here is a source you could check out . 
  once more totally `` we really , really are not biased source '' . 
  about the founder :  he is currently a fox news columnist . 
  he holds a ph.d. in economics from ucla . 
   lott is a prolific author for both academic and popular publications . 
  he has published over 100 articles in peer-reviewed academic journals and written eight books , including `` more guns , less crime , '' `` the bias against guns , '' and `` freedomnomics . '', 
  you 're reaching really hard , man . 
  the source from your quote is from 1995 . 
  things have worsened quite a bit since then . 
  on top of that there are many numbers taken out of context with small print on the bottom of the page . 
  do you have unbiased source ? 
  preferably something on his level ( peer reviewed ) , not random `` we totally are n't biased , no way , really '' source . 
  and where 's your counter source ? 
  i doubt anything changed since last time this question was asked . 
  i 've seen smaller pickup truck than dodge ram in my town ( 15k people surrounded by some villages ) and it looked ** really ** out of place . 
  it is not like android pay , because you skip the middle man . 
  that 's ( probably ) why google is n't pushing android pay in many european countries - people are used to contactless cards since they are available for quite some time and are quite entrenched . 
  i do n't know who taught math/logic , but that equation has nothing to do with what you wrote . 
  honestly , i 'm not even sure what this should represent . 
  yeah , that 's what i 'm taking about , exactly . 
  usa have one of the most restrictive immigration policies in the western world and there 's quite a lot of countries with more first generation immigrants than usa . 
  you live in the past , mate . 
   literally the entire population of poland could immigrate to france and it would still have fewer immigrants . 
  nice one . 
  but do n't count hyphenated americans in that category . 
  maybe it 's confirmation bias , maybe not , but it happens too often on too many levels * to be pure coincidence . 
  also remember that only small section of people stereotype whole usa as ` murica , we , the saser are making fun of individuals ... at least most of us . 
  * also things like `` you are all white '' , `` what do you know about emigration , we are country of immigrants '' , etc. 
   they find it just as off-putting to compare other big countries ( china , india , perhaps down to russia ) to the czech republic and other big federated states ( bavaria , ontario , victoria , etc ) to san marino . 
  i write this not as a judgement or measuring contest , here 's the problem , mate .
