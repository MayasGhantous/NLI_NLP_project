  if you like time travel recently there is quite a lot of better , or worse tv series centered around this . 
  travelers , timeless , frequency ( not strictly time traveling ) , dallas '63 and probably more . 
  [ i 've heard you like advent calendars , mate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plbamh6cywsjvndnhgub8gafbsz-wyt_re ), 
  but what 's there to understand ? 
  * he * identified himself as polish , similarly big part of his family ( his father side wss living on silesian lands for long time and on polish lands for over century before he was born ) . 
  you are like health ; ... '' ) , but he identified himself as polish . 
  yeah , but during that period his language would be meaningless . 
  there were quite a lot people in commonwealth that did n't speak polish , or did n't speak polish as first language . 
  people look at it from very modern perspective and come to wrong conclusions . 
  probably . 
  it looks like it was directly incorporated/derived from latin , contrary to polish and czech where it was incorporated in slightly roundabout way ( latin -  german -  polish/czech ) . 
  honestly ? 
  there is quite a lot due to our history and geographic position . 
  many , many words are so ingrained at this point that people do n't even realise that they have foreign origin . 
  we have a lot of german derived words . 
  burmistrz is derived from german b\u00fcrgermeister ( city/town mayor ) przedstawienie is calque from german vorstellung ( vor-przed ; stellung-stawianie ) ( performance/show ) we have words derived from turkish , like at\u0142as ( satin ) , or torba ( bag ) . 
  we have words derived from italian , like kalafior ( cauliflower ) , or kapusta ( cabbage ) ( thanks bona sforza ! ) . 
  we have words derived from our friends in hungary and neigbours and old crown lands , but there is simply too many of them to even start the list . 
  nordics and your love of cinnamon buns ... why ? 
  just why ? 
  but serious question , are n't cinnamon buns rather associated with denmark , or maybe were i mistaken my whole life and it 's more of swedish/nordic thing ? 
  norwegians and your love of milk ... who drinks milk at ~ 11 p.m. ? 
  of course we do . 
  but in all seriousness , whipping single women died ages ago and throwing water is highly dependent on temperature outside . 
  mate , it 's like asking `` do you like lany poniedzia\u0142ek ? '' . 
  it has no meaning to you , like mardis gras for probably 90 % of europe . 
  4g in one of the cities with highest population density in the world ? 
  i have a deal for you , then . 
  if you want to watch some youtube video , just pm me the link , i will download it , copy it on pendrive and i will send it to you , because it will be faster than your buffering . 
  is it * really * that bad ? 
  it is , in fact , derived from gaelic ( they have the same root , obviously slightly changed in witcher ) :  skellig ( e ) derives from the irish ( gaelic ) `` sceilg '' , which can be translated into `` rock '' or `` cliff '' . 
  there are also skellig islands in the atlantic ocean , part of ireland . 
  but culturally it 's bit more complicated , i guess . 
  obviously it 's just a game/books , so it 's hard to exactly pinpoint how much it resembles actual culture from the past and how much is done for the plot . 
   in the book the tower of the swallow , the residents and the belief of skellige largely resembles a mix between the real-world `` vikings '' and norse mythology and that of the ancient irish and scottish cultures . 
  in this way the skellige people almost certainly resemble the real historical people known as the norse-gaels who were a hybrid culture of the irish and norsemen . 
  * not really * , especially compared to other parts of the world . 
  skellige is mix of norse and celtic , but skewed towards norse . 
   i 'm pretty tired of being compared to skyrim actually . 
  yeah , you are more like skellige , but with less islands . 
  ^ ( i show myself out ), 
   i feel that inches have their place . 
  where ? 
   also fahrenheit is better for temperatures when in relation to humans that 's bullshit repeated over and over . 
  it is as good as celsius , you are just used to it . 
   also kilometers are really dumb . 
  too small to measure distance , so you end up with huge numbers when you do n't really need them for distance and speeds . 
  it does n't really make sense at all , to be honest . 
   also pretty safe to say that educated people around 30 and below speak english more or less fluently . 
  i really want to agree with you on that one , but it 's too often not true to say it 's `` pretty safe '' . 
  in theory this should be a case , because everyone after university should have at least b2 language skill , but in practise it 's so varied that i would rather say `` it 's safe to say that educated people around 30 and below have passable english '' ( because proficiency metrics showing how good our english is have really high self-selection bias ) . 
  in real life you have people that are perfectly fluent ( even if their pronunciation is rough around the edges ) , you have people with very typical `` school english '' , you have people that had good enough english skills , but were n't using it in day to day life , so they forgot a lot , you have people that were using old `` learn , pass the exam , forget '' method and on top of that you have people that were pushed out of the system with `` dst z du\u017cym minusem '' , because teachers did n't care and did n't want problems . 
  it 's hard , or even next to impossible to generalise everyone in poland . 
  older people generally can only speak polish and maybe some broken russian . 
  younger people generally * should * speak at least two foreign languages ( after high school ) somewhere between b1 and b2 levels , but in reality this may be ( at best ) passable english and broken german/french/spanish . 
  rule of thumb : better education person got and bigger city he lives in = better language skills . 
  no problem , mate , no problem . 
  if you are ~ ~ some language weirdo ~ ~ intersted in quirks of polish language feel free to ask questions . 
  i will try to explain it , but you know how it is when you know a language and you know by heart how it should be , but you really ca n't explain it ? 
  i 'm in that position . 
  `` m\u00f3w '' is , basically , direct order to tell something . 
  imagine a police interrogation and policeman is saying : `` m\u00f3w gdzie to jest ! '', 
  ( `` tell me where is it ! '' ), 
  vs older person asking a child : `` powiedz mi , ile masz lat ? '', 
  ( `` tell me , how old are you ? '' ) . 
  one is harsh and very direct , one is neutral . 
  on top of that you can make it more formal ( `` mo\u017ce mi pan/pani powiedzie\u0107 ... ? '', 
  - `` sir/ma ` am * , can you tell me ... ? 
   `` m\u00f3j drogi '' as if you 're talking to a lover not in this day and age . 
  it 's , basically , `` my dear '' . 
  depending on context it may be slightly ... intimate , but in day to day usage does n't really have connotations like that . 
  * sir/ma ` am is slightly poor equivalent , in usage it 's closer to german sie . 
   that 's a failure of society to not have assimilated them properly . 
  that 's rather broad statement . 
  sometimes it is , sometimes it is n't . 
  i would say that whole process is quite compliated and society may either help , or hinder attempts of `` outside community '' to assimilate , but it 's not sole reason . 
  and on top of that it takes 2-3 generations and it often looks like that : 1st generation - people that migrated to a country , 2nd generation - children of immigrants , often confused , because they live in one country , yet they hear about country of their parents quite a lot ( and in some cases - they hear only about good sides , that 's where extremism often commes from ) , 3rd generation - first true generation without any `` emotional baggage '' . 
   most were gang related that were near schools most ? 
  you know what that word means ? 
  and there is no single incident on that list that was done outside of school premise . 
  politely ? 
  but i know that i can pull his leg , just for shit and giggles . 
  i would n't really do that to a random person on reddit . 
  * what i wrote would be close ( ish ) to `` tell me your fucking name ! '' . 
  `` m\u00f3w '' is imperative and in this context may be seen as hostile . 
  yeah , but it sometimes is hard to find `` close '' name , especially for some typical , slavic names . 
  i do n't know op 's name , but i know i would have problems with finding something remotly similar . 
  yeah , but even in scenario like that you would be seen as someone who did n't master knife and fork , not someone polite . 
  at least here , in poland , it would be rather behaviour that you would associate with someone from typical small , poor village ( if done by adult ) . 
   also , how is only using one hand to eat child-like ? 
  well ... because children eat pre-cut food . 
  it would be almost like eating with spork on formal dinner ( and i 've seen , albeit only once , american sugesting that sporks are the way to go ) . 
  and not once in my whole life i 've seen putting your knife aside as a part of etiquette . 
  * cough * queen consort * cough * you are out of the loop !, 
  yeah , it 's basically the same here , but i think we have bigger variety . 
  i know there 's a `` reality show '' about hospital with so wooden acting that pinocchio would look like real boy . 
  they are basically shows aimed for stereotypical audience in that time slots ( mainly older people/pensioners and , how to put it politely ... above middle aged women ) . 
  depends on the circles you are around , but in the bigger scheme of things it 's [ not even 2.5 % difference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption#oecd_2015_rankings ) between poland and germany . 
  people in poland smoke almost as much as germans . 
  slowly , but surely i will introduce you to even more polish food .
