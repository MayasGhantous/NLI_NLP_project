  in no time you will be cooking [ bigos ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l0hegjl9jn0/vlu-enqcrri/aaaaaaaaa4e/sekyeagr0qi/s1600/1.jpg ) like a real polish man . 
  but firstly i have to convince you that [ grze\u015bki ] ( http://vendocafe.pl/var/storage/images/oferta/produkty-w-menu/grzeski/312-1-pol-pl/grzeski.jpg ) is true chocolate/waffer bar . 
  but god damn you englishmen and your love for cadbury milk chocolate !, 
  it will be the biggest hurdle . 
  obviosly , you go to polish shop and demand kabanosy no matter what . 
  and also some delicje . 
  and w\u00f3dka . 
  but you have father brown , 
   in other nations is sometimes a prior degree in higher education necessary for studing law i 'm not sure that this type of requirement exists anywhere in eu , but i may be mistaken . 
  it 's hard to judge , because it was during 3 days ( 2 days in the past ) festival called '' [ przystanek woodstock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woodstock_festival_ ( poland \\ ) ) '' . 
  record frequency for 3 days was 750000 * people . 
  * 750000 according to polish wikipedia , english wiki is saying `` in 2011 was a bigger festival with bands like the prodigy and helloween . 
  police had concerns of crowd numbers for the prodigy performance , with fans swelling over a million in the area to see them play . '', 
  you can always chech / r/learnpolish . 
  it 's not the most active sub , but you can always find some people willing to help . 
  also , there are some materials there , kurwa . 
  santa ... during x-mass ? 
  are you insane ? 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  what you wrote does n't make sense , since only bombing during ww2 you had in usa was , if we are generous , 350 bombs . 
   does ryanair fly to slovenia ? 
  why would i care about that ? 
  you asked about 1 euro tickets , i gave you 1 euro tickets . 
   is it reasnoble for people to plan trips a year in advance within europe ? 
  again , who is talking about planning year in advance ? 
  i showed you that planning ~ 1 month ahead is enough . 
   is terrorism expanding ? 
  sure . 
  it 's still as safe , if not safer , than your country . 
  at this point you have to be trolling me ... no one can be so stupid . 
  because you are stubborn as fuck and google is clearly not for you : [ last promo in february ] ( http://travelfree.info/2016/02/mega-sale-by-ryanair-tickets-just-from/ ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/725275/ryanair-2-flights-europe-book-before-midnight ) is about 2 euro promo in october . 
  mate , i 'm not even sure what to tell you ... you are on the internet , it 's not hard for you to find . 
  while 1 euro tickets are promotions 1-2 a year , you can still easily find one way ~ 10 euro tickets anywhere you want to go within europe . 
  shit , wizzair on the front page for poland have now 40 pln tickets , i gave you prices from ryanair , i do n't know what bubble you live in . 
  for god sake , mate ... i 've seen many stupid excusses , but this one is really weird one . 
  and * no one * is talking about planning year in advance . 
  literally i can book tickets krak\u00f3w-stockholm and back , in january for total 82 pln . 
  yeah , it 's not 1 euro , but come on ... then below 150 pln : oslo , dortmund , paris , brussels , eindhoven . 
  then below 200 pln : london , bologna , milan , rome , bristol . 
  and it 's litarally without any hunting , or waiting for promotions . 
  time is money , quite literally in this case . 
  if you are willing to spend time and plan well in advance you can easily have very cheap vacations/long weekends/whatever . 
  and where to buy 1 euro tickets ? 
  budget airlines are your friends , if you know what you are doing . 
  or , you know , red piller and all that jazz . 
   that does n't change the fact the i do identify with my european roots , though i know i ca n't lay claim to any of it . 
  does that make sense ? 
  not really , no . 
  how you identify with them ? 
  from things you said here you are far removed from people living outside the usa . 
  you may read about places their lived in , you may have fun learning about them , but in the bigger scheme of things it had meaningles impact on your way of life . 
  i would n't really judge popularity of a show by pure numbers of tv viewers in this day and age . 
  there is more and more legal and illegal ways that will skew those numbers and it was n't really impactful in the past . 
  sorry , mate , but you are out of your mind on that one . 
  while inteligentia was frowned upon , it does n't mean that in whole country no one attended universities , or that women were typical housewifes like in other countries ( quite contrary ) . 
  women were in the workforce , because it was necessity and while , obviously , some jobs were seen as `` for men '' and some `` for women '' it does n't mean that women were getting worse education than men . 
  i do n't know why this misconception still exists and is spreading , but neither do we . 
  like i very politely pointed out in different comment , we call them `` ruthenian '' , not `` russian '' , but that 's beside the point . 
  like in russia , pierogi are pierogi , but this one type ( quark + potato ) has specific name derived from region , any other type i can think about is basically `` pierogi z x '' ( `` pierogi with x '' ) , where x can be anything from meat to fruits and anything inbeetwen . 
  ruthenian pierogi , kurwa , not russian . 
  i 'm not sure how you can connect a and b. i know you have some weird military boner , but you are delusional . 
   we use a ranking system too [ ... ] we ( or at least my instructors ) use certain aspects of the military to help our companies build leadership skills and just build up discipline , and do military drill , mate , i 'm not sure i can even show you much clearer what it is . 
  there is no reason to even argue more with you , because you do n't see what is just in your face . 
   so you 'd rather have us just fuck around and not help our community ? 
  and there 's a big difference between patriotism and nationalism . 
  you know that there are multitudes of ways to do that without paramilitary system sponsored by dod ? 
   so , we should live up to the `` all americans are fat '' stereotype ? 
  again , what one have to do with another ? 
  i wo n't even touch rest of your retarded comment . 
   what the actual fuck is this ?? 
  that 's literally quote from jrotc objectives with u.s. changed to north korea . 
   so you 'd rather have us not learn how to work together and do stuff ? 
  * in paramilitary organisation * ? 
  again , there are multiple other ways , much better than learning military style obedience . 
   that 's only a pfc in the marine corps , the second lowest rank in the entire corps . 
  and ? 
  does it change anything ? 
  it 's literally in the goals of jrotc , yet you are minimalising it , or simply denying . 
  you still do n't see it , do n't you , mate ? 
  i will change one thing in what i copied from wikipedia and we will see how you will react . 
  ___  developing citizenship and patriotism  developing an appreciation of the importance of physical fitness . 
   increasing a respect for the role of the north korean armed forces in support of national objectives . 
   developing a knowledge of team building skills and basic military skills . 
   taking 3 -- 4 years of the course grants cadets the ability to rank higher if they pursue a military career . 
   about the community work , it actually is community work . 
  and ... paramilitary group on top of that . 
   but you ca n't find a brother/sisterhood anywhere else like in the us military . 
  sure , sure . 
  only in military !, 
  no one else can do it . 
  thank you for your service !, 
   and so having a military orientated program is nazi and fascist , but conscripting people is totally cool ? 
  did i ever said that ? 
  but having military orientated program that you defend as non-military is stupid and you are showing it everywhere in this thread . 
  it is paramilitary group that in the fucking name has `` officer 's training program '' and in the statue is clearly said :  developing citizenship and patriotism  developing an appreciation of the importance of physical fitness . 
   increasing a respect for the role of the u.s. armed forces in support of national objectives . 
   developing a knowledge of team building skills and basic military skills . 
   taking 3 -- 4 years of the course grants cadets the ability to rank higher if they pursue a military career . 
  it is what it is and i do n't have problems with that .
