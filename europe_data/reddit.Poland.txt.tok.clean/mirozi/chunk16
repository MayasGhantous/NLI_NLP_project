  they are probably not . 
  believing internet polls is close to believing in magic . 
  between self-selection bias , agenda pushing and simple pranks you often ca n't find truth ( boaty mcboatface , anyone ? ) . 
  while there may be some resentement towards eu , because some younger people may see we looking down on ee , generally younger people are for eu . 
  edit : there , not they . 
  no , no , no . 
  i can think of many worse things i could say , like `` do you know that you can wire up belts ? 
  '' , or `` do you know how many entities per second can belts move ? 
  '' , or `` do you know that there 's trick to fully saturate belts ? 
  because regular ` inserter to belt ' never saturate belt completly '' . 
  that would be trully evil , mate . 
   he 's playing it , but i think he 's close to disowning me . 
  if you want it to happen , because you secretly hate him : show him bob 's mods , then angel ores . 
  later introduce him to arumba 's youtube channel , so he will see how to * really * calculate everything , how to design things more efficiently , etc. 
  at this point he will either disown you , or will land in nearest psychiatric hospital . 
  no one said factorio ? 
  how dare you !, 
  factorio + mods is the way to go . 
   also having to manage your vassals so they stay in line and do n't ask for you to give up some of the powers you have over them . 
  obviously you did something wrong here . 
  [ manage ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pldrq-fatdg6yrvtf44zqdky_r_exkjba4 ) . 
   did n't they kill cyberpunk 2077 ? 
  i remember seeing some early dev discussion , but have n't seen much since . 
  why would they even do that ? 
  hell , since release of w3 they released some information , but they do n't want to say much for now . 
  oh , shit , i missed that they are made with peanuts . 
  i 've seen cornmeal grits and my mind blocked the rest , so i thought about things like our [ flips ] ( http://www.grupabgk.pl/images/flips/duze/01_flips_naturalne.png ) ( with variety of flavours ) . 
   things like smoki why are you eating dragons ? 
  but in all seriousness , if wiki description is right they are not really unique to slovenia/your region . 
  they are definitely known in poland and , i think , at least to some degree in germany . 
  i 'm not sure if you are serious here , or pulling my leg . 
  who teleported utah to eu/europe ? 
  i mean ... i would n't call it `` proper rye bread '' , it 's just type of rye bread , nothing proper there , 
  would n't be his first one , mate , would n't be the first ... 
  one is british stag parties , like mentioned in other comment . 
  and i 'm not sure i want to open second can of worm , because i suspect how comments may look . 
  let 's just say that they travel in groups with government security and often are very rude , or outright hostile towards locals . 
  yeah , but you are describing it like building some weird tribalism around * school * not people within it . 
  mascots , colours , etc are borderline meaningless for people here , school is just institution , nothing more - people rarelly identify with institutions , at least in poland . 
  it really depends . 
  most people have rather positive attitude towards tourists . 
  but there are two specific groups of `` tourist '' that are almost universally hated by everyone . 
  the good side is that they almost always are visiting one specific city , sadly - it 's my favourite city , krak\u00f3w . 
  you see ... it 's complicated . 
  there are people ( often holligans and right wingers ) that have negative view about jewish people , but often it 's quite different than people assume - someone smarter summarised it quite well some time ago : `` not every jew is enemy , but every enemy is a jew '' . 
  there is also second layer here - israel as a country and their approach to poland . 
  behaviour of young people from israel during their `` mandatory visits '' is ... sad and on top of that they are fed more propaganda and / r/badhistory than we are * . 
  * [ defamation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defamation_ ( film \\ ) ) by yoav shamir explains it quite well . 
   the review in the los angeles times praised the documentary for showing `` how accusations of anti-semitism can easily be exploited for political purposes . '', 
  there is definitely high selection bias , but it can give you at least some information ( mainly : if you meet young person how good their english is ) . 
  it 's especially misleading in countries that were on the wrong side of the iron curtain - there 's very clear cut off point between `` virtually no one is speaking english '' and `` virtually everyone is speaking ( at least some ) english '' . 
  it depends what op means here . 
  if you have counterfeited items already in eu ( either by producing it here , or importing from outside eu without getting caught ) you can relatively easily become `` retail seller '' on the internet without any suspicions . 
  the auld alliance ? 
  the auld alliance !, 
  there could be other philosophs . 
  i 've seen also `` ch\u0142opski filozof '' . 
  there is definitely a lot of people that had to flee from partitioned commonwealth and then helped other countries ( one way or another ) . 
  from top of my head : [ j\u00f3zef bem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_bem ) [ kazimierz pu\u0142aski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casimir_pulaski ) [ ignacy domeyko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_domeyko ) [ ernest malinowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernest_malinowski ), 
  but you could also argue that cereals are not popular breakfast choice . 
  at least from my perspective neither eggs , or cereals are eaten amongst adults , with small exception of muesli . 
  and how many of them are diesels , exactly ? 
  and how many of them fall into `` car category '' , instead of `` truck category '' ? 
  `` tanie wino jest dobre , bo jest dobre i tanie ''  i know that in the past you could buy cheap `` wine '' in biedronka ( way below 1 euro ) , but i do n't know how it looks like now . 
  it 's not that black and white , basically in your scheme you could prove that you are from any country . 
   or do they tell the people that they understand and can relate to those issues ... if they even come up , which religion never does . 
  so no , no one cares about it . 
  hahahaha . 
  i do n't know if you are even serious at this point . 
  religion never comes up in the usa ? 
  you are in denial here . 
   this subreddit needs troll control . 
  indeed it does . 
   they are n't , you misrepresented what they wrote . 
  again , i am misrepresenting something ? 
  or maybe you are just in your la-la land ? 
   and no one cares . 
  but 26 , on your scale , is on the wrong side of theocracy . 
  yeah , better 26 than 0 , i guess ( or closeted 24 ) . 
  and what 's your point , exactly ? 
  should we list institutions that you ca n't get access to ? 
  it 's rather bad planning on your side  there are many dishes that can be easily stored for `` emergencies '' like you are describing . 
  you can easily freeze things like [ pierogi ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p7jtg2tbxvy/unc-xxe1gii/aaaaaaaaikk/mx6sjnkaqjq/s1600/pierogi+ruskie+2.jpg ) ( with variety of fillings , from sweet to savoury ) , or [ bigos ] ( http://mytastykitchen.weebly.com/uploads/2/0/5/8/20589656/5080196_orig.jpg ) and you can reheat it in 5-10 minutes ( just examples from my country ) . 
  btw . 
  [ blame canada ] ( https://piwnakompania.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/piwnakompania_blame_canada_01.jpg ) . 
   you just showed that in federal politics politicians try to appeal to the most people . 
  no one gives a fuck about religion . 
  wait , wait , do n't you really see contradiction right here ? 
  either they are trying to appeal to the most people , or no one gives a fuck about religion . 
   you seem to have an unhealthy obsession with the us . 
  why is that ? 
  why not ? 
  it 's nice past time to read stupid things . 
   his losing had nothing to do with him being an atheist . 
  which you would know if you read past tabloids and r/atheism . 
  since when cnn and washington post are tabloids ? 
  and i literally never been in / r/atheism , but whatever floats your boat . 
   so how many open atheists are there in spanish and polish politics ? 
  ca n't say for spain , but in poland : 26 .
