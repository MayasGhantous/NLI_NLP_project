  why are you changing topic here , mate ? 
  we were talking in context of politics and i gave you reputable sources . 
  there is no open atheist in us congress and only one was n't re-elected when he said he is atheist . 
  hell , people in congress will deny that their are atheists . 
  so what does it tell us ? 
  yeah ... you sure about that ? 
  because i 'm not , neither is [ cnn ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/31/opinion/moreno-atheists-unelectable-congress/ ) . 
  to quote it :  so far , only one sitting congressman , pete stark of california , has ever admitted to being an atheist while in office . 
  first elected in 1972 , stark came out of the atheist closet back in 2007 , but he lost his re-election bid in 2012 after serving in the u.s. house for 40 years . 
  edit : [ from washington post ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/atheist-politicians-may-run-the-uk-but-they-remain-closeted-in-the-us/2014/08/22/bf147a3a-2a12-11e4-8b10-7db129976abb_story.html ) :  but just because they 're not out does not mean there are no atheists in the halls of congress . 
  `` we already know of 24 members of congress who have told us privately that they do n't believe in god , but they wo n't come out , of course , and if we tried to out them they would deny it , '' ardiente said . 
  [ ... ]  serah blain at the secular coalition for arizona supports his campaign and thinks many atheist politicians are closeted because of `` a strong association in the u.s. between morality and religion -- this idea that morality comes from faith . 
  right now it 's still politically risky to say you can be ethical without a belief in god , '' she said . 
   peanut butter basically non-existent . 
   jam/jelly/preserves very popular , mostly made with local/wild fruits , sometimes people still make them in home . 
   ready to eat meals not really popular , mostly seen as `` food for students '' , definitely not something that someone with functioning family would cook . 
   common breakfast items depends on person , but most probably some kind of open sandwich . 
   cereals if anything - muesli . 
  everything else is for children and odballs . 
   common condiments mustard , mayo , some sandwich sauces . 
   when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ? 
  most people are buying dry pasta , it varies with sauces . 
   common alcoholic beverages ? 
  stereotypical vodka and beer ( including many craft beers ) . 
  mate ... most scientific journals are behind heavy paywall and many of them are run by american companies . 
  do you think that somehow access to your reasearch is easy/cheap ? 
  maybe you do n't even know how much it cost you , because someone is paying for your access . 
  tell me one thing : in which country saying `` i 'm atheist '' publically is shot in the knee ? 
  is it usa , or spain ? 
  by popularity ? 
  probably straight vodka shots , then long , long nothing and then : [ szarlotka ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wkdusocjgp4/vhdtxdmhc-i/aaaaaaaaa5o/x2ghtrogmna/s1600/zubrowka%2bdrinki.jpg ) - \u017cubr\u00f3wka with apple juice . 
  [ w\u015bciek\u0142y pies ] ( https://krakowadventura.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dscn1091.jpg ) - raspberry cordial , vodka and tabasco . 
  and others that are rather popular around the world , like mojito , or sex on the beach . 
  yeah , but that 's cheating . 
  you have to have chrismas market and snow in one place . 
  you see , your defensive stance about any negative comment about usa is what i am talking about . 
  so `` shut your negative mount '' and show some humility . 
  edit : a letter . 
   the worst of all ... without magical snow !, 
  ftfy * , 
   i didnt like how everyone gave their criticisms so freely . 
  i get it . 
  but sometimes its a bit much . 
   where im from you keep your negative mouth shut or risk getting your teeth knocked down your throat - there are days thay i miss that behavior - moderating element . 
  you do n't like honesty ? 
  i mean , that 's bit much , do n't you think ? 
  getting beaten due to saying something ? 
  and then you wonder why usa have problem with violence ... 
  it 's definitely bad driving culture , but there are solutions for that , like lanes with separators and i 've seen at least few roundabouts built recently that are using it ( [ rondo turbinowe ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/rondo_turbinowe ) / [ turbo roundabout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundabout#turbo_roundabouts ) . 
  thanks netherlands ) . 
   how many per cent polishness do you have ? 
  he probably had 1.23 % ... [ if you know what i mean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_alcohol_content#highest_recorded_blood_alcohol_level.2fcontent ) . 
  here 's the thing : some of the people may be pretty neutral about their heritage and they do n't deserve backlash , but there is many that deserve it . 
  case in point , we had american in / r/poland some time ago that tried to find `` patriotic clothing '' even that his only connection to the country was ... well , there was no connection , really . 
  he tried to `` hijack '' symbolism of `` polish struggle '' he had no connection to , from context at least 3 generations did n't live in country at all . 
  to quote him :  how about you live in a country that is not where your parents --  grandparents --  great grandparents were from and then see it from that perspective . 
   i should not be labeled as fake for something i had no control over yet want to understand where i came from . 
   accent-free there is no such thing as `` accent-free '' language/dialect . 
  hochdeutsch may be `` standard '' , or `` neutral '' , or whatever you want to call it , but it 's not accent free . 
  it 's even worse when it 's coupled with : '' [ put here some stereotypical trait from country y ] , because i am [ 1/2 ^ n y ] '' . 
  i would n't even say that continental countries like him . 
  hell , in the bigger scheme of things i would say that only two countries have positive view about bonaparte - france and poland * . 
  * i know it 's simplification , but it 's often repeated around some parts of the internet . 
  it 's not even that . 
  many important cities have localised names , you do n't need proximity to borders . 
  for instance i doubt there is country in europe without at least few cities without name translated to polish ( the biggest outliers here may be gb and ireland , at least from top of my head ) . 
   but why pretend it is something it 's not ? 
  because clearly you do n't understand it . 
   like who ? 
  [ i 'm not going to have a conversation with strangers on the tube because that 's just odd . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/537s4r/why_are_you_in_general_so_cold_with_strangers_in/d7qrd44 )  so basically it is n't a friendly culture and you 're getting emotional because i 've described it as exactly what it is ? 
  [ ... ] just as that american described . 
  yeah , talk about reading comperhension , right ? 
  i know that english is my second language , but it 's weird that you have problems with reading it . 
  i will put it in bold italics , so you wo n't miss it : *** this makes people appear sad but they 're really not . 
  people are very warm when you know them personally . 
  *** *** i mean not in the way that we want it to be answered . 
  `` fine '' with a cheesy smile just is n't the polish way . 
  ***  instead you had to time waste , beat around the bush and falsely misrepresent polish culture . 
  yeah , i 'm clearly wasting time on a dick like you , but at least i do n't misrepresent my culture , contrary to you . 
   like with russians , even smiling is considered a faux pas * totally * . 
   your idea of american friendliness is straight up stupid , as is your idea that everyone enjoys living in an eastern european-style social environment full of cold , unfriendly and inhospitable people . 
  did n't i just tell you to actually stop pretending that you know anything ? 
  because straight up you are playing stupid here . 
  hell , even your countrymen in this thread are contradicting you on every step . 
  you are not whole uk , your judgement is not judgement of the whole uk . 
  just stop pretending , because you are making fool of yourself based on some weird stereotypes based on ... i do n't even know what . 
  maybe few people that did n't like you and were honest about it ? 
  people that actually honestly answered your `` how it 's going ? '' ? 
  people that did n't beat around the bush when asked a question ? 
  maybe in your silly mind you took being honest and streightforward as `` cold , unfriendly and inhostpitable '' ? 
  maybe instead of cushion of artificial friendlieness you need some perspective ? 
  from american living in poland :  * poles do n't smile at people on the street . 
  unless you 're crazed or interested in them . 
  i had to train myself not to do that when i first moved here . 
  this makes people appear sad but they 're really not . 
  people are very warm when you know them personally . 
  in fact when i think about it , why do we smile at everyone ? 
  so that strangers think we 're nice people ? 
  kinda weird .
