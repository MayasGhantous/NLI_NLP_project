  [ ... ]  * poles are more direct than native english speakers . 
  there 's no need to add please to the end of the every single request . 
  our requests are like `` i was wondering if you could possibly maybe for just a moment help with something really quick , please ? '' and i think poles find that exhausting . 
   * poles do n't ask everyone `` how are you ? '' and even they do n't like the question much . 
  i mean not in the way that we want it to be answered . 
  `` fine '' with a cheesy smile just is n't the polish way . 
  try it and see how uncomfortable they look . 
  they 'd prefer to answer sincerely and that 's cool too but you ca n't do that with a salesperson , for example . 
  so just do n't ask . 
  trust me . 
  also , in poland , it 's kind of bad taste to brag about yourself the way we might when we 're asked this question . 
  [ source ] ( http://polonization.pl/10-things-to-know-as-a-newbie-in-poland/ ) . 
  oh , yes , that 's why polish hospitalty is rather shocking for so many people comming here . 
  it 's because we hate social interactions . 
  can you stop pretending that either : a ) everyone is you , b ) you know * anything * about other people ? 
   but it beats going to the same cafe everyday , seeing the same people and never talking to them . 
  maybe for you . 
  i 'm not going to cafe to talk to random people . 
  i 'm not looking for some fake social interactions just to open my mouth . 
  most people , contrary to you , want to be left alone . 
  and we not even count here extreme introverts . 
  and you are going the whole other way around . 
  do you really think that every person you will see will be interested in you ? 
  that guy in the que will care 5 minutes after you stop talking ? 
  do you think that waiter in restaurant will care about you ? 
  i do n't refuse to have anything with other people , i refuse pointless interactions , like many people in this thread . 
  i wo n't pull smile # 5 and chit-chat skills , because we are standing in the que together , it 's que , not trenches . 
  but it does n't mean i wo n't help if asked for it . 
  oh , we like friendliness . 
  we do n't like artificial friendliness . 
  and i do n't think many people , even in uk , share your view . 
  from what i 've seen , even in somewhat mocking tone , that people were very flabergasted when someone actually sincerly answered their `` you alright ? '' . 
  when someone ask this question in poland we want sincere answer and definitely do n't ask this type of question to `` random people '' , especially not as a greeting of any sort . 
  because ... often they are . 
  if they ask you `` how are you ? '', 
  they do n't want sincere answer , if they smile like madmen it 's not because they are really happy . 
  it 's clash of cultures . 
  they pretend they are interested , but often there is no follow up . 
  it 's rather similar question to one asked [ recently ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/52xofo/what_are_you_countrys_best_beers_and_what_are_the/ ) . 
  it 's definitely hard question to answer , because it will depend on your prefered style . 
  in the bigger scheme of things rather unique for poland are baltic porter and grodziskie , but we are making a lot of good beers in many different styles . 
  to somewhat copy my previous answer : there is at least 6-7 breweries that you could take any beer they are making currently and be happy with it . 
  it 's one of the most popular beers in poland , according to wikipedia , but i somehow blocked that from my mind * . 
  it 's rather on the cheaper side , similarly quality/taste wise . 
  * they started pretty extensive marketing campaign few years ago and they have pretty memorable/funny ads , but it was time when i became slight beer hipster and i missed \u017cubr popularity completly . 
  from mass produced beers there is basically only [ \u017bywiec porter ] ( https://piwospiesz.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/zywiec-porter-1.jpg ) . 
  if you are bit more lucky - [ grand imperial porter ] ( http://www.chmielowisko.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/grand-le%c5%bcak.jpg ) . 
  you can also look for [ porter warmi\u0144ski ] ( http://browarkormoran.pl/piwo/4/porter-warminski.jpg ) . 
  this are three that have probably highest chance of being there . 
  it will be slightly cop out answer , but it really depends on a specific day . 
  after long summer day i would go for viva la vita from browar pinta , in the winter i would go for something bit heavier with more abv , like grand imperial porter . 
  but it 's really hard choice , [ this one shop ] ( https://ebrowarium.pl/polska-c-22_3.html?language=en&amp;sort=1a ) has almost 400 of polish beers and it definitely does n't have everything that 's seasonal , or was produced in the past in small batches . 
  the most popular are definitely brands from mass producers ( in no particular order ) : \u017cywiec , tyskie , lech , warka . 
  the best ? 
  it 's hard to judge , because the best beers are made by contract breweries , so they are available when batches are made . 
  there 's rotation in beers outside of the `` core '' which is relatively easy to buy almost all of the time . 
  best beers that are always available : grand imperial porter from browar amber , fortuna czarne from browar fortuna , ciechan lagerowy from browar ciechan . 
  the best of the best ? 
  this will be very subjective . 
  atak chmielu from browar pinta , imperator ba\u0142tycki from browar pinta , king of hop from alebrowar , geezer from browar kingpin . 
  but in reality it 's really hard to single out few beers , when there is at least 6-7 great breweries where you can take anything that they are making in given time ( obviously if you like given style ) . 
   \u017bywiec zdr\u00f3j is nestle , it 's not . 
  and mazowszanka . 
  and dar natury . 
  and do n't say there is no escape . 
  there 's a lot of local brands . 
  hahaha , it 's basically the same story here , in poland . 
  they were selling bonaqua and no one was buying it . 
  they removed bonaqua from the market , they created proper mineral water ( kropla beskidu . 
  i do n't think that it was acquisition , but they created it from the scratch ) and distanced `` coca cola brand '' and `` kropla beskidu brand '' . 
  hell , probably there is big group of people that does n't know that kropla beskidu belongs to coca cola . 
  like i said , most young people know what a/c is , especially in context of cars . 
  i did n't say we use it in speech , but some people use it in newspaper/internet ads for private selling of cars . 
  on top of that - you do n't have `` klimatyzacja '' button in cars , it 's a/c . 
  edit : a word . 
  depends on the word , really . 
  we do n't use a lot of recent loanwords , but definitely some ( like tablet ) . 
  on top of that some obvious acronyms are known ( like a/c ) , but in general speech polish words are used . 
  and there are no real rules how loan words are treated , some are localised , some are not , some are slightly changed to fit into grammar rules . 
  edit : word , not world, 
  but is n't troll bait the best bait ? 
  i know at least a few , from polish ones : [ arhn.eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjgirfp1beem98axxykxola ) , mostly about retro gaming , with some more `` fresh games '' . 
  [ dem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucof4jj9hm9rlsbii8lazi5a ) , satire/comedy . 
  he started as comic maker , but when he focused on yt ( imho ) lost part of his charm . 
  in english : [ ashens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucxt9pvye-9x_aicb1utmf1q ) , comedy/satire/old stuff/weird stuff . 
  hard to put him in one category , really . 
  [ barshens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucdyytfm5pzin4n0ht_nlxdq ) with barry . 
  [ brit lab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucdsotr6smdrxuwe7sjfrkhq ) , science/pop science . 
  [ emma blackery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucebpq6lnn_ov_y2xirzr3vg ) , comedy/vlog ( ish ) comedy and there are few `` spin off channels '' . 
  [ photoinduction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucl9oje9opxui-grsnwjsrla ) , because electricity can be very ... spectacular . 
  [ real ale craft beer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uctolk0fybreo9bwodmowaow ) , well ... beer reviews . 
  [ sariel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucuh5uajsvjan8we6gworrjg ) , polish channel , but in english . 
  if you like lego slightly too much it 's channel for you . 
  btw : there is more channels from brady haran , not only numberphile and computherphile . 
  i would n't say that we have disproportional amount , but definitely we had a lot . 
  sadly our turbulent history did n't help with bit more `` worldwide recognition '' and i think we could offer some authors/books on par with western authors , but we were on wrong side of iron curtain . 
  for instance , one of my personal favourites , [ chmielewska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joanna_chmielewska ) is not even translated to english , but was popular in both poland and russia ( and i do n't see any reason why her witty humour would n't be popular elsewhere ) . 
  sad truth is - you never know , especially if person has american flag . 
  we 've seen more outragues claims that were perfectly genuine . 
  but you still do n't understand how currencies work , right ?
