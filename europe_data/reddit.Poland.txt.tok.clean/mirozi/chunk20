  i know some people really like camping and it 's not money issue , but going with / u/diamantus train of thought i would rather go to cheaper place and have higher standard than go camping in spain and count every cent . 
  i understand that people want to go abroad , but then why they do n't go somewhere , where money can go much further ? 
  for bragging rights ? 
  it 's not really your confirmation bias , but / u/letsstaycivilized has much bigger point here . 
  if they know something it 's often skewed understanding . 
  the most recent big example was discussion about paid maternity leave in / r/mapporn and seemingly americans could n't grasp that it 's mandated and paid by government , not by employer . 
  so it 's as valid as putting it in the title of money transfer . 
  you will go to court and say `` hey , i 've sent him money transfer , it says `` pay before x '' and he did n't return it '' . 
  and that 's why there is limit when you need proper contract . 
  i really do n't see your point here . 
  `` outlawed '' ? 
  no one outlawed them . 
  major banks just said `` fuck cheques '' and stoped printing them . 
  it does n't mean they are outlawed ( prawo czekowe dz.u . 
  you just seems not to grasp that countries have different laws , especially about contracts . 
  cheque with memo on it about loan never was valid contract by itself , no matter if banks phased them out , or not . 
  but that 's the problem - neither would be cheque with `` loan to be repaid by january 1 , 2017 '' written on it - according to polish ( and probably whole eu ) law . 
  again , it 's difference in law and worlds we live in . 
  you do n't need this kind of paper trail . 
  you make money transfer , it 's enough evidence . 
  if you are lending more than 500pln you need to have contract for proof ( signed by both parties ) , like it 's said in civil code . 
   that 's wrong . 
  you could n't send me money that way , because i have n't signed up for the service . 
  however , you could hand me a check without me signing up for anything . 
  i have to give you that , but we are basking in oddities here . 
  you can argue the other side here equally - if you do n't have bank account yourself you ca n't write cheques at all . 
  if we assume the worse case scenarion , you can argue any point , but are n't we living in first world countries ? 
  bank account is not some kind of foreing concept that no one knows about . 
   another reason people often use checks is the `` paper trail '' . 
  the bank saves a copy of the front and back of every check , so everything you 've written on there gets saved and is admissible in court , including your signature and whatever you choose to write in the `` memo '' field . 
  but it 's the same case of any other money transfer . 
  hell , i can pull e-signed pdf at any time and it will have same value , or it can be directly requested from bank if needed . 
   really , if you ca n't think of any scenario where a check would be better than another form of payment , then you do n't have a very good imagination . 
  maybe , or maybe we just simply live in completly different worlds . 
   let people do things the way they want , if they 're not hurting anyone . 
   in transactions where you must also provide extra documents , yes . 
  at least until everyone has a flatbed scanner in their house , or until all paper documents are eliminated . 
  that 's the crux of the problem - you ca n't do it entirely on-line and i can do most of the things . 
   you have to do more than enter a phone number to send money to someone . 
  you do n't . 
  i mean ... you have to put how much you want to transfer and you have to put phone number . 
  i 'm slightly pulling your leg here , because it 's only roughly one year old technology , but in november of last year over 130k transactions was done that way . 
  and you see , we have slightly different starting point here . 
  i value instant transfers over waiting for clearing the cheque , both as sender and recepient . 
  how long does it take nowadays in the states ? 
  2 days ? 
  3 days ? 
  but who said most cases have to be handled by being there in person ? 
  there are cases like that , because you have to `` exchange physical goods '' , for lack of better term ( that 's why i mentioned specifically car registration , because you have to take old registration plates and take out new ones , if it 's necessary ) . 
  your logic is flawed , you are arguing that if it 's good enough you do n't need to do anything about it . 
  somehow we , in relatively poor country , could handle such transition , but you ca n't ? 
  do you really think that handling things online would * increase * workload ? 
  that automatic payments are somehow slower than guy sitting in small room checking cheques is better than computer doing it ? 
   writing a check took 30 seconds . 
  entering a bunch of information about the person into a phone app would 've taken far longer . 
  how long are your phone numbers that it would take more than 30 seconds ? 
  how long she needed to wait until it was depostited on her account ? 
  that 's why i said people are defending cheques to no end . 
  nothing you said convinced me that they are better , it only convinced me that your system is dated - it looks like system we had not long after fall of communism , paper , paper , paper and some bureaucracy . 
  but it 's fail of your government/banking system , not some high utility of cheques . 
  even if i would need to do similar thing i would simply transfer money beforhand and it will be automatically accounted for ( depends on institution - either by personal account number , or simply by specific title ) . 
  hell , nowadays in poland i probably would n't need to send any paper , because i could do it online , or i would need to be there in person nonetheless , because it can only be done in person ( like car registration ) . 
  edit to your edit : maybe for you , but not for me , especially in this day and age . 
  if it 's my friend i have his contanct information , so i can easily do it with phone app ( and if he is in one of few banks i can do it by typing his phone number ) , if it 's for company i will either have their information stored already , or will get it with purchase . 
  then it 's simply 30 seconds and 0 cost for me . 
  and what is scenario in which personal cheque is the most convenient option , in your opinion ? 
  because i , personally , ca n't think about any . 
  i have doubts about it , mate . 
  major banks phased out cheques in around 2002-2005 and no one had problems with it . 
  you are , probably , in minority . 
  it 's rather common discussion on reddit and people are defending cheques to no end . 
  honest to god i talked here with a guy who was giving money to dad ( for some kind of car payment ) via cheque . 
  people are defending cheque ocr on their phones like it 's some kind of technology out of this world  and when i 've seen fee for money transfer via internet i died a little inside . 
  btw , [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheque#north_america ) has quite a nice insight here . 
   in the us , an estimated 18.3 billion cheques were paid in 2012 , with a value of $ 25.9 trillion, 
   technically each bank should be able to give you a cheque book if you ask , not true . 
  even pko bp phased out cheques completly quite some time ago . 
  they can process them , but you ca n't get them afaik . 
  you 're quite right , kurwa . 
  and like you said , most of us have rather clear boundries when it 's acceptable and when not . 
  are you some kind of child prodigy ? 
  why do you even think that you are eligible for any financial assistance , especially that you want to study from your home country ? 
  this does n't make sense , to be honest . 
  if you like mountains there are definitely nice landscapes ( obviously we do n't have mountains as high as in some other countries ) . 
  and [ morskie oko/sea eye ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morskie_oko ) is quite amazing . 
  in poland i would go with [ tatrza\u0144ski park narodowy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_national_park,_poland ) , or [ bia\u0142owieski park narodowy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_national_park ) . 
  [ whole list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_poland ) . 
  honourary mention , because it 's not np , but protected area : [ pustynia b\u0142\u0119dowska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c5%82%c4%99d%c3%b3w_desert ), 
   black pudding is congealed pig 's blood , no , it 's not . 
  it 's sausage with blood ( with quite a lot of ingredients ) . 
  you are describing it like there 's only blood and nothing else . 
   could you care less ? 
  at least do n't butcher the language in that way , because your question does n't make sense with fucked up expression . 
   their language sounds hilarous . 
  our language sounds hilarious ? 
  your language sounds hilarious , panie krecik/krtek . 
  `` ancestry '' gives you almost literally nothing in most of the countries . 
  i think even ireland cut it down pretty substantially . 
  all americans ? 
  obviously not .
