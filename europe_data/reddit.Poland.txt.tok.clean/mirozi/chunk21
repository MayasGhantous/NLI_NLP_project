  some americans ? 
  sure and we see this quite often , this thread is just one of the examples . 
  do you really think that there are no similarities between most americans ? 
  it 's very young country with one overarching government . 
  you think that there are some enormous differences , but they are smaller than you think . 
  most of you speak english , most of you follow one of two parties , most of you have very similar values and goals . 
  yes - you eat different things . 
  one place calls it soda , other calls it pop . 
  but in the end you are all americans . 
  do you really think that difference between two random parts of usa are bigger than difference between two random countries in europe ? 
  are you sure it was the same brand , because we have few with rather similar packaging ? 
  i do n't recall this specific brand in poland ( but maybe i missed it somehow ) . 
  or maybe your polish section double up as `` eastern european '' section . 
  it really depends what do you mean by `` techie '' here . 
  if it 's general interest in technology - none of them , because you will have hard time/it will be almost impossible to get long term permit . 
  if you have any experience and/or education you can basically go to any country and have decent/above average living ( expecially if it 's experience in some technological niche ) . 
  mate , do you think that there are still people living in mud huts in eu ? 
  that seems quite long . 
  out of curiosity , how long were courses and how long were breaks ? 
  to put it into perspective in my schools , as far as i remember : classes were 45 minutes ( what is pretty standard everywhere , i think ) , regular breaks were 5 minutes , we had two 15 minutes break up to hs and one in hs only one 20 minutes, 
  how much time do you spend in schools in belgium ? 
  because it 2 pm is generally standard time in our equivalent of high schools ( if memory serves me well it would be between 1pm when you had 6 classes and 2pm when you had 7 ) . 
  you ca n't be taught neither . 
  and it 's not like most of the differences are in speaking/accents , but mostly vocabulary and spelling . 
  i think it 's bit broader `` problem '' . 
  tourist often do n't see city they are visiting as a place where other people live - for them it 's just one big tourist attraction . 
   literally the only thing that 's worth the price is the default cheeseburger for roughly 1 $ i would n't even go as far in poland . 
  if you know what you are doing from pricepoint perspective you can get better deals , both for `` snack '' ( one cheeseburger/hamburger ) and proper meal . 
  if you mean purely socially - i would lean towards no ( maybe with exception of uk , because they are always oddballs and they long time ago established [ open university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_university ) that was built around distance learning ) . 
   you are entrenched in this idea that there are no unique food offerings from the us , you know that at this point you are arguing with strawman , not me , right ? 
  literally in my first comment in this chain i said that tex-mex and cajun food is unique to the usa . 
  but steak is not . 
  we can put a long list of dishes that are not unique to the usa , but are * also * your regional dishes . 
  i agree that it may be part of native/regional cuisine , but in 90 % of cases it will be similar to `` roots '' / dishes it was derived from . 
  that 's why i agree that things like tex-mex , or variety of creole foods are unique , but i do n't see anything worthy of `` exporting '' in terms of steak , or `` hipster stuff '' . 
  similarly things like chowders are not unique to the usa , it was another european dish made with local ingredients . 
  i hope you know that [ butter joke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep-fried_butter ) is just a joke , right ? 
  or rather stereotype about [ your food ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/f39ca51e681d4943b3fd99913be4fd57?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=bb1aed3121f3a7321346d4410b885381 ) . 
  but back to the point : you nailed it , there is nothing unique in dishes he mentioned . 
   new england seafood dishes are carried and range from grilled , steamed , or poached fish to shellfish to baked goods . 
  so ... like very other country with access to ocean ? 
   what kind of steak ? 
  totally unique . 
  no one ever though about it before usa . 
   how exactly does one add butter to steak anyway ? 
  i have [ news ] ( http://www.bakedbyjoanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/img_2282.jpg ) for you . 
   oh and then there is the beef itself , corn fed lot-raised beef is different from open range grass fed beef . 
  yeah ... it 's worse , but that 's beside the point . 
   you also seen to think that steak is limited to the midwest , the mountain states are the ones with the grazing to produce the best beef . 
  am i ? 
  i just answered to previous poster claims . 
   oh , and there is lamb too . 
  you shocked me so much !, 
  i never though about lamb ... oh , wait ... people were eating lamb long before usa was formed . 
  or even thought about . 
   as for potatoes , there is a ton you can do with them beyond mashing or fries . 
  you can ? 
  we have no potatoes , so i would n't know . 
   fresh salmon right from the run , crab , amazing fresh produce . 
  totally not accesible here . 
   you are trying to homogenize a state that has both temperate rain forest and deserts that still qualify as `` frontier '' lands . 
  i 'm not doing anything . 
  at least for now . 
  i 'm just trying to find anything unique , but there 's nothing so far . 
   also , what is your fascination with butter ? 
  [ mine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep-fried_butter ) ? 
   ( yeah , there are fried foods and if you have n't had real fried chicken you are depriving yourself of a great pleasure ) or clogged arteries . 
   how about the variety of just bbq to start who is talking about barbecue ? 
  definitely not me , or op . 
   ( which is a pretty damn big place , by the way ) now you went so full sas that i even do n't know what to say . 
   the best chinese was in los angeles ( and that includes my travels to hong kong and taiwan ) care to guess way ? 
  small hint : regionalisation of food . 
  and what is exactly unique in new england seafood ? 
  that you use more butter than any dish in europe ? 
  what is unique in midwest steak and potatoes ? 
  that you use ( again ) more butter than any dish in europe ? 
  what is unique in oregon hipster stuff ? 
  that you use olive oil instead of butter ? 
  what is unique in deep fried southern food ? 
  that you use canola oil instead of ... well . 
  i do n't even have anything stupid to say here . 
  with exception of cajun and tex-mex we already have equivalents of `` styles '' mentioned by you . 
  it 's not like we need to import `` new england seafood '' , if we have seafood of our own ( be that spanish , or french , or any other ) . 
  one thing that may be interesting : in some countries , like here , mcd is not really promoted as `` cheap fast food '' ( and prices mirror that ) . 
  it 's definitely not go to `` restaurant '' of choice for many people - you can find cheaper alternatives . 
  i think it 's sort of regional . 
  i 've never heard it at least in southern ( ish ) parts of poland . 
   this does seem a bit odd , considering we 're not talking about primary schools or high school . . but college . 
  but your sport culture ( and heavy connection to schools ) starts at least in high school where you have to fight for scholarships in universties . 
   and american colleges and universities wipe the floor with their european counter-parts . 
   i think the top 100 rankings in the world are mostly american schools . 
  yeah ... if you look at rankings that are heavily biased towards particular expectations from universities . 
  if you look at methodology of rankings like [ this times one ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ranking-methodology-2016 ) you will see that actual teaching is ~ 1/3 of the score and big part is based on ... reputation . 
  on top of that it obviously favours english speaking countries over any other language . 
  but that 's still not point of this discussion . 
  i 'm not doing anything here , i just explained why he ( possibly ) wrote it that way . 
  of course it 's condescending , as it should be . 
  looking at statistics about quality of education from elementary schools to high schools in your country it 's pretty sad . 
  add to that `` help '' for `` star players '' so they can have passable grade and you have our picture of your schools . 
  if my sources are right , at least for 2014 : 1 . white/pearl white 2 . black 3 . silver 4 . gray 5 . red 6 . blue 7 . brown 8 . orange,
