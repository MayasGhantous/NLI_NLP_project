  so wait , are they voting for interest of their group , or are voting to `` merge mexico and usa '' ? 
  because you are moving goalposts quite hard right now . 
   i thought there is no such thing ... 
  i thought there is only american vote . 
  do n't play stupid here . 
  you are playing stupid here and you know it . 
  you are painting those people as `` outsiders '' , people that will vote for interest of country they may have no real connection with and not `` sub-group of americans '' ( which is still weird , but that 's not the point here ) . 
   that 's essentially what they mean anyways . 
  yeah ... in your mind . 
   ( of which mexicans/hispanics are by far the largest group ) oh , so you are one of them . 
  people that live in your country for few generations , similarly to other migrants in xx century are now not `` americans '' , but `` mexicans/hispanics/latinos '' , ot whatever you want to call them , just because few generations ago someone emigrated from different country . 
  for god sake 83.7 % of americans are `` non hispanic nor latino '' . 
  for once your weird race relations can give some nice results to use in pointless discussion on the internet . 
   merge literally no one used that word there . 
   still think this is some `` slippery slope conspiracy '' ? 
  yes , yes i do . 
  you would `` few mexicos '' migrated to the usa ( and all speaking in one voice ) to even make a dent in internal politics . 
  you literally quoted people that want to closer ties between two countries and `` having leverage '' . 
  do you think that mexico will go full sudetenland on california ? 
  so ... in the end you do n't know what ponzi scheme is , do n't you ? 
  nice slippery slope there , mate . 
  i ca n't agree with you 100 % on this . 
  yes , some people treat it like that , but many do n't . 
  it 's one of the most common tropes here . 
  people literally say that they are `` irish '' , or even more `` irish than people from ireland '' . 
  you can see similar trope of `` something is in my genes '' , even things purely developed by upbringing . 
   i think you 're talking about govt/state support for people who do niche sports where you ca n't make enough money to actually support yourself . 
  i think in austria this is done via the army in many cases . 
  like the athletes are officially employed by the army but can use most of their time to practice . 
  it 's quite different here , but take it with the grain of salt , because it may differ from uni to uni . 
  scholarship you are describing may be even non-existant here . 
  in case of niche sports it is mostly sponsored by teams ( and it may be conencted to ministry of sport and tourism , polish olympic committee , or similar organizations ) . 
  in terms of scholarships in universities it 's very similar to scholarship for good grades - it 's merit based . 
   no sports scholarships either , afaik . 
  i mean , i do n't know how it works in austria , but you sort of can get scholarship in polish universities . 
  obviously not `` we pay for your tuition '' ( because there 's no need for that ) , but you can get some money if you play sports on national , or international level ( like you said - outside of school ) . 
  your questions are unanswerable now * , at least without painting in very , very broad strokes . 
  differences between countries are big enough to basically dismiss every question bar last one and even that one will depend on season , specific city , etc. 
  * and will be borderline unanswerable in 2018 , or 2019, 
  it 's bit more complicated . 
  it is big ( ish ) in usa because it is , for all intents and purpouses , only option they have . 
  in most european countries it is just alternative . 
  i do n't need third party option if i have ( in my opinion ) better alternative directly from the bank . 
  some banks have own apps you can pay with via nfc , all cards issued nowadays have touchless payment and i can get contactless `` visa sticker card '' from bank . 
  yeah , i think i was mistaken . 
  it looks like it 's random here , too ( but it 's rather ambiguously phrased ) . 
  i do n't know how it 's set in different countries , but iirc it also needs pin after certain number of transactions . 
  it looks like site for freelancers . 
  you mentioned something different , but in the bigger scheme of things many shops either have local versions ( like mentioned by you ebay and amazon ) , or are selling things across eu ( even things like beer  ) . 
  no , we are insulted due to ignorance . 
  i simply do n't agree with your statement - lack of knowledge and logical thinking in this case is willful ignorance , it may be reflection of education system , it may be personal , but outcome is the same . 
  but it proves your point even more . 
  why we should n't be insulted . 
  or annoyed ? 
  you paint yourself as `` the best country '' , yet simple train of logic is problematic . 
  you paint yourself as `` the richest country '' , yet clearly education about anything outside of usa is lacking . 
  in theory * maybe * he could do this - if any university social programs would be applicable to him , but i have doubts that 's the case if you study abroad . 
   edit : yes it 's just alcohol and food ... because your priorities are right , 
  in [ * this * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4nnso0/phone_plans_for_traveling_through_several/ ) subreddit ? 
  it 's literally second post after yours when i [ put `` sim card '' and sorted by newest ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/search?q=sim+card&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) . 
  simlalrly [ sim countries ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/search?q=sim+countries&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) work . 
  step up your game , op , it 's probably one of the most frequent question here . 
  yes . 
  maybe . 
  can you use search and come back then ? 
  basically ... everyone ? 
  but it depends what do you mean by barbecue specifically . 
  some countries will have more `` elaborated dishes '' , in some it will be sausage , or chuck steak . 
  i would say that there is definitely much less hamburgers . 
   i have never heard anything like that here it 's definitely repeated here , on reddit , quite often . 
  basically it boils down to `` americans ca n't have [ nice things ] , because they are paying for safety of others '' , or `` it 's easy to have [ nice things ] in europe , because americans are paying for their military '' . 
  [ nice things ] = be that healtcare , free university , or some welfare programs . 
   seriously though ; to be fair , europeans do it to the usa all the time as if we are a homogeneous , monolithic people when really we are closer to what the eu would look like if it ever federalized . 
  not really . 
  you overestimate the differences within usa and underestimate differences in eu . 
  you could find some similarities , sure ( like economic differences between countries in eu and states in usa ) , but even then it 's not that simple . 
   honestly , i think this sort of thing is overplayed/overrepresented on reddit . 
  [ excuse me ? 
  * ] ( http://m.mlb.com/news/article/187351764/first-base-fort-bragg-game-unprecedented/ ) [ what about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r9hh0gayak&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m41s ) ? 
  * [ video ] ( http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2016/07/04/890721983/1467598747797/asset_1800k.mp4 ), 
  but then why you want to travel if you just see glimpses of what cities have to offer ? 
  sometimes less is more . 
  3 , tops 4 cities for a two week trip ( especially that you will have to travel ) . 
  i would add generally tatra mountains for fourth . 
  i do n't know why so many people are recently obsessed with borderline speed traveling , where 's the pleasure ? 
  and then you end up with people that mix break and gas pedals . 
  it 's mix of things , really . 
  we do n't have as many high speed roads ( that are generally safer ) as other countries and to some degree it creates vicious circle - we are speeding on regular roads , because everyone is in hurry and there is no alternatives . 
  also - relatively old cars . 
  officially palace would deny everything , even if she would be caught running around naked with sign saying `` fuck eu ''  you know , shapeshifters and lizardpeople . 
  definitely more important here is what clegg said and general reputation of tabloids in the uk . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  you will always have old people that do n't want change , people that want change now will become old and entrenched in the future - they will vote for status quo and own benefits ( see brexit ) . 
  and keep in mind that your two party system is not helping here either . 
  maybe easier than some other things . 
  in the bigger scheme of things this still would be a problem , considering how strict are rules now . 
  and on top of that you would need to put your whole fabric of society upside down to even start creating such union . 
   and only if someone acts upon his preference , then he is not just a pedophile ( which is not punishable ) it 's bit more complicated in usa , at least that 's how it looks from some [ comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3i0qty/til_germany_has_a_program_targeted_at_pedophiles/cucd23u ) . 
  so in worst case scenario - even if you are seeking help ( and did n't do anything ) it may be turned against you, 
  at least by few people ,
