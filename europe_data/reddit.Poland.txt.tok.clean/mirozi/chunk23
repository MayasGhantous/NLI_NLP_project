  in the bigger scheme of things they are just rebranded chinese tablets , but they do n't have same `` stigma '' ( at least that 's how it looks like here ) - badge engineering ftw !, 
   i had it in my ( admittedly ignorant ) mind that the eu already had the infrastructure in place to shunt , say , a belgian regiment to a polish countryside for a land dispute . 
  not on eu level . 
  things like this for now may be done between countries , or by other organizations ( mainly nato and un ) . 
  i would say * almost * anywhere . 
  i do n't know how it looks like in countries he mentioned , but we have some clubs aimed for 21 + people . 
  there is not too many of them , but you can find one , or two in bigger cities . 
  yeah , i can think about one more : they may think that they are temporarily embarrassed millionaire . 
  and you do n't ? 
  just look around . 
  many , many people believe in `` bootstraps '' , many people do n't want socialised medicince , for god sake - look how many people is supporting trump , the ultimate proof of my theory . 
  no , no , no . 
  he is american , `` fuck you , got mine '' is their credo . 
   i mean , i 've seen how people drive in greece and in the countryside in poland , well yeah we 're nice drivers in france . 
  you need some russians to get a perspective  you would praise polish drivers ( but yeah , many of us drive very ... aggressively . 
  to say the least ) . 
  what are you smoking , man ? 
  you should stop , it would be better for everyone around you . 
  are you personification of / r/noshitsherlock ? 
  same here . 
  looking at what they are producing ( i had to google . 
  weber - grills , kitchenaid - home appliance , carhartt - work clothes , red wing - shoes ? ), 
  they are basically unknown , because they have enough competition , or are subsidiary of bigger companies and have `` local brands '' . 
   sahne muh-muhs yeah , they are called kr\u00f3wki ( little cows ) . 
  this type of fudge is definitely polish in origin ( and delicious  ) . 
   leffe inbev  ~ ~ hoegarden ~ ~ hoegaarden inbev  ~ ~ kronenborg ~ ~ kronenbourg carlsberg  frogbeer one not owned by enormous beer conglomerate . 
  like i said , i 'm talking about small breweries , that are often sold only locally and do n't have `` official '' worldwide distribution . 
   ( the us recently managed to have a beer that was eligible to be called a trappist too by the way ! ) . 
  yeah , but looking at what they are brewing it 's not in the same style as trappist beers in europe . 
  for god sake , they are brewing ipa there . 
  they may fall into trappist category , but 50 % of beers are not in style . 
  i really have doubts that best european beers are sold in the usa . 
  there is huge market domestically ( in the eu ) where small/local/artizan / craft ( however you want to call it , because people are sometimes anal about this ) breweries can expand into and shipping it to the states is simply not cost effective in any meaningful scale . 
  why would someone sell beer from poland , if market even nowadays is not saturated and basically every decent beer is selling like hot cakes . 
  someone misinformed you , at least slightly . 
  we have equivalent of your gp , it would be `` first contact doctor '' ( in a various forms , but it 's besides the point now ) that * can * send you to specialist . 
  man , this is / r/shitamericanssay . 
  yes , when rains in europe we are scared and do n't know what to do . 
  and if 3 countries is `` all over europe '' for you i have shocking news for you ... 
  it 's bit complicated and it will heavily depend on who do you ask , but mostly it will be somewhere between `` fuck the army '' ^ 1 to `` we need military , but i 'm glad i 'm not there '' ^ ( 2 ) . 
  definitely end of conscription warmed up military 's image , but it still is mostly `` meh '' for most people . 
  you have to keep in mind that during communist poland army was ... interesting , to say the least ( i tried to find some articles in english about `` fala '' in army , but to no avail . 
  think hierarchical prison culture , but in the army and either you are `` in '' , or have problems ) . 
  as an anecdotal evidence : i know a guy who won * selekcja * ^ ( 3 ) , but avoided army like a plague . 
  ___ ^ ( 1 ) often older people , or people that did n't avoid conscription ^ ( 2 ) basically eveyrone else ^ ( 3 ) selekcja ( translating to , you guessed right , selection ) is a `` survivor '' show based on special forces military training . 
  there are hundreds , if not thousand people that go to `` pre-selection '' , less than hundred goes to `` selection '' that lasts week , around 10 wins/ends . 
  edit : a word, 
  is there a country that really has favourable opinion about military ( bar unspeakable one ) ? 
  i know , i know , but * because * they are popular and often make/talk about foreign ( for them ) food i wanted to mention them in this context . 
  that he does n't want general tso as a example of chinese food , 
  if we are talking about `` tv personalities '' - do n't follow hairy bikers ' recepies . 
  they are great in documenting trips , but they often butcher food . 
  i would say that even if we would want to look at it from cultural perspective it 's not really `` european '' , but creole culture . 
  like others said , if you plan in advance everything is open for you , because flying is cheap . 
  you can always take ferry and you can reach everything close by . 
  eastern/central europe will be cheaper than western europe . 
  same here . 
  it 's the weirdest may i remember . 
  it was extremaly hot not so long ago , but recently it was 5c at night . 
   diy is very popular in the uk [ it seems so ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucl9oje9opxui-grsnwjsrla )  but in all seriousness , some forms of diy are popular everywhere , but they may be different than in the usa . 
  i would say that things like car renovations seems to be slightly less popular here . 
  definitely , there were here and there , but not as common as they are now . 
  my primary school was even younger , but iirc it did n't have urinals at all ( later my liceum had some , but they were relatively new ) . 
  it 's hard to judge in universities , because there is very mixed bag of old and newer buildings . 
   afraid of having other men see their dicks . 
  go into a large men 's bathroom in any shopping mall , and you 'll see all the cabins taken by men pissing . 
  naah , i would n't put this in that context . 
  i would rather say that until relatively recently urinals were borderline unheard of in poland . 
  i can bet that big part of 40 + generation was raised in `` urinal-less world '' , especially if they are from smaller towns . 
  i would add some simple questions to that : `` where is x ? 
  '' , or `` how to go to x ? '' . 
  also , very simple : `` where the hell am i , because my gps is not working and this map is total rubbish ? '' . 
  but in additional serious note : op should know if given language is using `` formal language '' when speaking to people you do n't know . 
  oh come on , you can say it about many flags , yet no one ( in western europe ) is doing it on the scale you do . 
  i 'm not sure you are right . 
  if anything social background ( and differences between the states and most of the european countries ) matters more than theme . 
   if you hav n't actually looked into it then likely you know your own countries propaganda . 
  and if you did n't look into it you know post-war propaganda that was still alive until middle '90s . 
   not so much for the americans . 
  and like i said - it 's not the case . 
  * cough * pu\u0142aski * cough * . 
  it may be news for you , but yes , we affilations and we were on the same side for longer than you can imagine , both long prior and during the war . 
  you did n't even say `` a '' in what . 
  but it still does n't matter . 
  it does n't matter , because i know history of my own country . 
   like i said , i agree , you conceded the main point a long time ago . 
  because if you are stupid enough to not recognize government in exile there is nothing to talk about . 
  everyone recognized it , roosevelt , churchil , hell - even stalin ... until it was for his benefit , but smartass / u/realsourlemonade is smarter than them - he knows , he got a in high school . 
   got an a level in it . 
  whats your level of education on the topic ? 
  so maybe you should set your degree on fire , because clearly that a was given to you for pretty face . 
  like i said , we have nothing to talk about anymore . 
   end of invasion of poland . 
  6 october 1939 . 
      attack on pearl habour . 
  7 december 1941 . end of recognition of polish government in exile : 5 july 1945 . can you get your facts straight ? 
   you all suffered under and fought against the same soviet union . 
  following your logic you have an obligation to defend them . 
  i 've seen a lot of flawed arguments from you , but now you reached the fucking top . 
  literally .
