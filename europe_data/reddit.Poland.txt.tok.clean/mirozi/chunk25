  you probably can , but is it worth it ? 
  about what ? 
  but what is here to differentiate ? 
  it has nothing to do with any circlejerks , i would need to go out of my way to find inch screws , because pn/din/iso ( the most common norms used here ) are using metric . 
  as an * accesory * to camera ? 
  sure . 
  but it 's not like you can buy it in every hardware shop . 
  but that was n't your question :  my question to you is if there was something that you really wanted to build from plans , but it required you to go out and purchase some 1/4 '' -20 hardware , how hard would this be based on whatever or wherever you purchase your hardware from ? 
  what would you want to build from plans in europe that would need `` inch screws '' , if metric screws are ubiquitous ? 
  out of curiosity : why do you think they would exist in europe ( maybe excluding uk , because they always are oddballs ) ? 
  it depends how you 've learned the language , really . 
  many speakers , at least in poland , tend to learn english ( or at least bump the knowledge to bit higher level ) outside of school . 
  because you have bad rep in that parts of reddit  i 'm 90 % sure op is not american , just stupid ( after some interesting discussion in / r/poland ) . 
  price/quality is important if we are talking in generals . 
  if you are speaking specifically about one ingredient then it does n't matter . 
  remember that while some chocolates/sweets from american brands may be available here in many cases they are produced here and made for our palate . 
  for instance mars , inc has factories in few places around europe and exports many things from here . 
  no problem . 
  but in all seriousness , it 's hard language , but it 's doable . 
  [ kurwa ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kurwa ) is like more versatile equivalent of english `` fuck '' . 
  it 's in second lesson of polish language , just after lesson `` you will never learn perfect polish as a foreginer '' , 
  i 'm glad to hear that . 
  and if you want to learn polish ... good luck . 
  but small hint : if you add few ` kurwa ' to your english you will be treated like one of us . 
  for someone from the other side of the world - really nice . 
  and contrary to many of your countrymen you did n't forget about us in central/eastern europe  iirc statistics about tourists in poland you are in pretty exclusive group in that regard . 
  tesco ( and few other `` western chains '' ) had perfect market in eastern europe post 1989 . keep in mind that it would be really hard to expand in other western european countries , but in central/eastern europe there was basically vacuum that needed to be filled and at that time there was no domestic competition . 
  if you look at super/hiper-markets in poland everything is foregin investement , similarly in discount shop market . 
  daily ... mail articles ? 
   creationism , that is , the idea that god created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time ** within the last 10,000 years ** i have to agree with / u/schwertritter here . 
  you are really looking for things just to prove something . 
  slash the numbers in half and it still be scary statistic . 
  but there is exact question about yec . 
   b. creationism , that is , the idea that god created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years 39 % - definitely true 27 % - probably true i 'm not sure what previous question someone would need to ask me , so i could give one of those two answers . 
  it 's consistent with question from 2005 :  which of the following statements comes closest to your views on the origin and development of human beings -- [ rotated : human beings have evolved over millions of years from other forms of life and god guided this process , human beings have evolved over millions of years from other forms of life , but god had no part in this process , or god created human beings in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it ] ? 
  with 53 % answers `` god created man exactly how bible describes it '' . 
  from the same poll 35 % says that `` science is in conflict with religion '' . 
  and we are not talking about abstract questions , like `` if the public schools in your community taught the theory of evolution , -- that is , the idea that human beings evolved from other species of animals -- would you be upset , or not ? 
  '' , where , indeed , you can easily skew results . 
  we are looking at very simple yes , or no questions . 
  [ hmm ? 
  ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/21814/evolution-creationism-intelligent-design.aspx ) i 'm looking at it and it looks rather reasonable , do n't you think ? 
  here 's the thing , mate : it is `` the thing '' . 
  you are painting yec museums like it 's some kind fringe occurence , but it 's not . 
  first `` thing '' - they exist and it should be first red flag . 
  maybe for you it does n't turn the debate on its head , but for me it does . 
  hence - `` the thing '' . 
  and if we can dismiss any polling on your basis there is no reason to have any polls , no matter how reliable organisation is . 
  second `` thing '' is - textbooks in some states , like we can see , have disclaimers and it 's second red flag . 
  it 's unbelievable for virtually anyone in poland and people see us as some fringe devouted christians compared to the rest europe . 
  `` the thing '' is - it 's not as fringe as you think it is . 
  they succeed already , the disclaimer is still there , people see evolution as `` controversial '' . 
  between 40 and 50 % of americans believe in yec . 
  have you seen * questioning darwin * ? 
  it was cringworthy for me , but people shown there are existing in usa . 
  here 's the thing - there is more than one of the yec/pseudoscience musems in the usa . 
  another thing is that on state levels people are fighting with things like evolution ( from trying to ban it out right to put asterisks that are saying it 's `` controversial '' . 
  [ sweet home , alabama ] ( http://gawker.com/alabama-refuses-to-remove-textbook-disclaimer-calling-e-1765671996 ) ) . 
  it 's slightly unfair , to be honest . 
  while church/religion has impact in poland it 's completly different set of beliefes . 
  we do n't have as much literal interpretations of the bible , we do n't really have young earth creationists , etc. 
  our religious people are mostly very conservative , but are far from american protestants in everything else . 
  looking from purely financial perspective ? 
  not really . 
  pkw ( pa\u0144stwowa komisja wyborcza - `` state electoral commision '' , basically authority over every election in poland ) got a lot of flak for many things ( like delays from broken it system ) , but it would be rather hard to `` cheat the system '' in any way in terms of finances . 
  my god , no . 
  first thing : you ca n't take money from companies ( in more strict words : only [ natural person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_person ) can give money for `` campaign fund '' ) . 
  one person ca n't give more than 15 times `` monthly minimum wage '' ( 25 times minimum wage if there are more than one election in a year ) . 
  then there are limits how much they actually can spend per candidate in given electoral district ( so every candidate from a `` komitet wyborczy '' [ `` electoral comittee '' ] have same `` upper limit '' no matter how big or small district actually is ) . 
  then there is limit that maximum 80 % of funds can be used for `` marketing '' . 
  that 's the gist of it for poland . 
  obviously this is for sejm and senat , but this will be very similar for presidential campaigns ( identincal contribution limits , etc ) . 
  edit : letter, 
  considering that there actually is a lot of other sweets that may be `` new and exciting '' going for the shittiest one of them all is quite ironic , do n't you think ? 
  i know that we should hate ourself by default , but everything has limits , even self-hate . 
  i would n't recommend hershey 's chocolate to the worst enemy , lord have mercy . 
  you should check [ this ] ( http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data ) . 
  it gives nice overview , but it 's always the best to then check providers sites . 
  your site gives one of the most bullshit offers i 've ever seen . 
  if you really want internet just go to any corner shop in country you will be currently visiting and buy some prepaid simcard . 
  it will cost fraction of that price . 
  you did n't tell us * anything * about universities you want to study at . 
  you should n't look at cities , but opportunities that you will get from studying in certain places . 
  it 's better to go to one of the better faculties in agh than to some third sort private university in vienna . 
  i mean if op likes music he can find at least * some * free festivals . 
  but at least from perspective of poland it 's the worst date for catching some free music . 
  it 's after the ( often free ) [ juwenalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juwenalia ) , but before [ woodstock festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woodstock_festival_%28poland%29 ) . 
   at least catholic religion is strong here and that 's what dissuades muslims . 
  yeah , i was under impression that they do n't come here , because we are ( relatively ) poor , but whatever floats your boat . 
  it 's not really about rests , but it 's a city for ~ 2 days ( if we take 1 city fora country , it 's even worse if it 's multiple cities ) . 
  you either will be rushed everywhere , or you wo n't really see anything . 
  my flair is pretty visible , mate . 
  of course that consensual sex is not illegal , or stupid , or anything else . 
  but it does n't mean that there are no consequences to it and responsibility lies on ** both ** sides . 
   the problem is , though , that trust certainly is n't always reliable . 
  and ? 
  i kid you not , there are contraceptive methods for both males and females . 
  i do n't care if you have one night stand , but it does n't mean that you can be reckless about it . 
  you - by having sex - accept everything that happens . 
  you found a crazy girl that * really * wants your semen ?
