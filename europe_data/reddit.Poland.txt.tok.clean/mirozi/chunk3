  but at least they * will * have representation if party they are voting for will go over mandatory threshold . 
  in fptp you can have 49 % of votes and 0 representation . 
  it would be even worse in this countries , because it would create rulling of minority over majority . 
  how in your mind this can be good for political climate ? 
  it 's the worst system to represent `` views '' of the population . 
  it pushes towards 2 parties , where voting on third party is just wasting votes . 
  even proportional system is better than that , but in this day and age everyone should aim to chose better voting system ( even like stv ) , not worse . 
  like i said in other comment , cgpgrey have really unbiased videos about voting systems : [ about fptp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo&amp;index=1&amp;list=pl7679c7ace93a5638 ) [ about gerrymandering ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mky11ujb9ay&amp;index=3&amp;list=pl7679c7ace93a5638 ) [ example in last uk elections ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ), 
  if you like to know more why fptp is shitty system i recommend cgpgreys videos : [ about fptp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo&amp;index=1&amp;list=pl7679c7ace93a5638 ) [ about gerrymandering ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mky11ujb9ay&amp;index=3&amp;list=pl7679c7ace93a5638 ) [ example in last uk elections ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ), 
  i 'm glad that turnout was so low , but it shows how stupid we are , if fptp have 80 % support ... 
  we can throw someone into space  5 of 8 medals is throw ( both discus and hammer ) . 
  yep . 
  some cars stay here ( mainly vw * ) , rest goes futher . 
  * because poles love second - , or thirdhand passats . 
  and golfs . 
  osmotic pressure , man . 
  i have to say , please do n't hit me , [ dead snow 2/d \u00f8d sn\u00f8 2 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2832470/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ), 
   lmao , it is not a bribery . 
  just our health services equivalent to nhs are underinvested and doctors need to accept people privately i 'm not sure if you live in the same poland as i do . 
  bribing is especially visible in medicine , even that they are trying to get rid of it . 
  it 's still there , no matter if you want it , or not . 
  in terms of bribing police officers - yes , this changed a lot . 
  \u017cubr\u00f3wka and apple juice ? 
  and people are wondering why we make fun of czech language . 
  * * inside joke . 
  as a pole - i 'm all in !, 
  aldi in poland is almost non-existant ( even that they have 100 shops ) in most people 's minds . 
  lidl is doing better , definitely , but still biedronka is the biggest one here . 
  and there is kaufland , probably comparable to aldi . 
  collectively probably they do  and it 's harder to hear mistakes . 
  next time just do it [ our way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspebbwkppc ) , 
  we can find something for uk too , if you want , 
  this will be wild guess , but maybe because , you know , they need it ? 
  if they are physical workers ( like constructors ) they probably have some kind of meat/cheese/spam / whatever for lunch and they need fresh bread . 
  and beer , you know , it 's beer . 
  if temperatures are high , it 's probably the best drink after work . 
  what ? 
  it 's somewhat debatable . 
  you have to remember that in many parts of poland `` standard '' is still small flat in old commie blok . 
  but if we are talking about `` amateur porn '' it 's still , sort of , aaa porn ( if we are not talking about two teenagers with camera ) . 
  it 's not the best documentary , but i recommend `` hot girls wanted '' . 
  this one is tricky . 
  as a rule of thumb i have to agree , but from the other hand police sometimes is ... expanding the law and milking people - that 's the truth . 
   they break half the stuff in the apartment and accuse you of digging through their suitcase because they ca n't find the can opener they brought from poland . 
  it 's even worse when we/they ca n't find cans ( or jars ) , 
  in poland probably [ malbork castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malbork_castle ) ( maybe for red keep , or old town , or part of king 's landing ) . 
  some parts of the whole series are aired in poland ( on davinci learning ) , including new , `` environmental '' one ( from 2009 ) . 
  this would work only in one case : monopoly of one/regional providers ( what is impossible in most of the eu due to various regulations , notably `` last mile sharing '' ) . 
  you would need big conspiracy between every isp . 
  if we really want to be nitpicky , it 's `` fourth oldest still in use '' . 
  small , but notable distinction . 
  you have hundreds of subreddits to chose from and you 've chosen one that have nothing to do with this . 
  if you know it 's not about europe ... why did you do it ? 
  without pulling exact numbers , definitely second biggest will be volleyball . 
  then handball , basketball and probably speedway . 
  it stopped once , so there is always hope . 
  you should listen to the podcast . 
  he explained in details why he is choosing bit different topics . 
  i do n't want to step on grey 's territory here ( all hail robotic overlord ) , but generally he said : it 's cgpgrey channel , now thanks to subbable/patreon i do n't need to rely solely on ad revenue and i can create bigger variety of videos . 
  but we do n't know * now * . 
  that 's the point . 
  everyone who knows clarkson even a bit knows that he `` does n't mind alcohol '' . 
  but for now i could say that he attacked producer with technique taught by forgotten shaolin monk . 
  you know , i 'm not expert here . 
  i 've seen only few `` famous '' persons , i `` talked '' with one ( i mean talked is gross exaggeration . 
  i said `` good luck '' , he said `` thanks '' , that happened ) . 
  nonetheless , like i said , there are `` third party sources '' i can rely on here , including clarkson 's articles and the nerdist podcast . 
  like i said , i 'm not defending that . 
  i just hate when people are adding unconfirmed things to create `` story '' . 
  i think it 's bigger problem . 
  people are sometimes expecting too much . 
  it 's sometimes discusses when `` stars '' ( or recognizable people ) are in less formal interviews . 
  would you disturb random stranger during meal ? 
  i would n't . 
  so why this thing is `` ok '' toward `` stars '' ? 
  so now he was drunk ? 
  story evolves ... or maybe someone is spreading silly informations ? 
  i wo n't defend punching a guy , but there is so much story created that we do n't know what really happened . 
  common sense . 
  if it 's shitty humour/meme/something was spelled there incorrectly on purpose , do n't post it here . 
  because community and spirit of subreddit is not always the same thing . 
  with this logic / r/science would look like / r/awwducational . 
  maybe because it 's dubious quality content and we do n't want stupid shit ? 
  good , now we can shoot in ** every ** direction . 
  i think [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercapacitor#transport ) have good breakdown here . 
  look at trams part . 
  tl ; dr : it works sort-of-like-battery-but-not-quite , 
  definitely we can be proud !, 
  i think solaris is now one of the most recognizable polish brands in europe ( excluding vodkas  ) . 
  and they created pretty amazing hybrids and cng powered buses . 
  and solaris can into [ electric ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/sol150.jpg ), 
  i think in most eastern european countries it 's mix of [ old ones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstal_105na ) and [ high tech futuristic prototypes ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris_tramino ) ( do n't have english wiki , but prototype in krak\u00f3w have supercapacitors to store energy ) . 
  my point is : in this particular case polish organizer made a stench , our media caught a hot topic , then portugese media caught it and from `` incident in a hotel '' we have international sensation . 
  according to recent interview that prosecutor gave ( after prosecutor made * actual * interview with victim with translator available ) we know : there was no physical violence at all and perp was n't a 38 years old soldier . 
  that 's why in / r/poland i was saying that people should wait with judgements until we will know more , but sadly i was called `` extremist '' when i wanted at least shadow of the doubt , because this case was stinking from the beggining - at least judging from materials available in polish language . 
  ok , i have a question then : did * any * media in your region actually made follow-up with recent news and what prosecutor found ? 
  [ ekhem ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4fs4wo/til_in_1893_the_queen_of_hawaii_attempted_to/d2bope5 ) . 
  guy bit further in chain is even better . 
  so never say `` no one '' , especially if it 's about your countrymen ignorance . 
  is that you joshua ?
