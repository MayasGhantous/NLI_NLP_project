  should we talk about things like agency 114 ? 
  portraying poland almost like a barbarious nation ( both in case of the past and the present ) ? 
  hell , your beloved france was not much better than others in that regard . 
  edit : should we check who is [ roleplaying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#total_deaths ) ? 
  or maybe you want to somehow dismiss this numbers , too ? 
   now let 's get back to the yalta conference , it was in the ussr , with a weak dying us president ( the guy died two months after ) . 
  they could have treated them as an enemy of course ( if he had the force against stalin in its own territory , but i doubt it ) everything 's forgiven then . 
  / s of course it was power play , but this play costed my country , not yours . 
  it 's easy for you to talk about it from comfort of your country that was either much less devasted ( if we are talking about france ) , or virtually untouched ( in case of usa ) . 
  and you seamingly ca n't distinguish two things - pointing out events of the past and current events . 
  it was western betrayal , both in 1939 and near the end/after the end of the war - only fool ca n't see that . 
  but you missed that poland is in nato , poland is in eu and cooperates with both ( or at least did that until current government happened ) . 
  you have some weird views about what happend after wwii . 
  do you really think that eastern europe fell into ussr 's hands because usa did n't march east ? 
  it fell into ussr 's hands because of cowardice of allies during conferences , like most notably - yalta . 
   did they welcome hundred of thousands of yours who were running away from the tyranny ? 
  yes they did . 
  i have lived in a polish neighborhood at one time when i lived in the us , trust me , they did not miss poland ( the us flag was always above the polish coat of arms , and none of my friends spoke polish even though their parents did ) . 
  do you think it 's unique ? 
  there are `` plastic poles '' , like there are `` plastic paddies '' . 
  and they are probably the same people that live in the `` polish past '' , but it 's not discussion for this time . 
  if you think that somehow migration to the usa was unique to poles you should rethink it . 
   i know the us is the ideal guilty party , but they did not put you in this shit in the first place nor in any place guilt trip party ? 
  no , it 's just your arrogance . 
  and i wo n't repeat `` western betreyal '' argument again . 
   but please stop with that us bashing , they have helped you much more than you think . 
  did you know that the cia provided funds and equipment to solidarnosc for example ? 
  of course that they provided funds . 
  like in any other place during cold war . 
  at least you did n't fuck us up by proxy war like you did in many parts of south america , so yeah : thanks for that . 
  it 's funny how you can find something that it 's not there . 
   do n't forget that the us `` system '' beat the soviet and freed your people . 
  you do n't want to take this route , mate . 
  believe me . 
  then we would need to remind you who put us in this shit in the first place . 
  not really . 
  relatively big part of polish ( or more accurate - commonwealth 's ) demographic was able to vote ( especially compared to other countries of that time ) . 
  and it 's especially funny when criticism is comming from usa with your system that would be bordeline unaceptable in most european countries ( and i 'm saying it even that i do n't agree with current political climate in poland ) . 
  edit : wild `` h '', 
  * at least * two of saying that you think are dutch are used in other countries ( or at least in poland ) :  wie een kuil graaft voor een ander , valt er zelf in is the same as polish `` kto pod kim do\u0142ki kopie ten sam w nie wpada '' and  iets door de vingers zien is polish `` patrze\u0107 przez palce '' . 
  who said `` here 's how to pay by sms '' ? 
  it 's `` here 's how you pay by mobile payment '' . 
  things that have `` app only '' checkmark are mobile payments methods , not mobile carries ( and i did n't explain it properly earlier ) . 
  let 's say you have vodafone phone and want parking for hour : send your registration number to : +36707636703 ( where +3670763 is one part of the number and 6703 is code for lenght of parking stay ) why are you so much bothered by numbers on top left side ? 
  it probably gives more information for local people ( if numbers are structured similarly to poland ) than for foreginers ( that would use prepaid sim cards , not third party apps that have only `` app '' checkmark '' ) . 
  while `` unexplained numbers '' are bit weird table on the bottom * is not half empty * . 
  if you will look at it some providers have only app checkbox checked . 
  i do n't really see anything wtf here , it 's explained in english , but it 's rather hard to read many parts from this picture . 
  so what 's your point , exactly ? 
  what did you try to imply by saying `` i use my credit card for everything because i fly a lot so the points are worth it for me ... '' ? 
  it 's you , nothing more . 
  either you are projecting your usage vs whole eu , or it was thrown there without any reason . 
  it does n't matter how shitty the website is , you can always download pdf directly if it bothers you that much . 
  i do n't know why we are still talking about it . 
  i showed that you are wrong , eot . 
  so , wait , let me be clear that i got you right here . 
  your personal anectode is better than actual usage statistics ? 
  and shitty website ? 
  it 's fucking eu 's official website . 
  yeah ... that 's why [ numbers are so high for credit cards ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/reports.do?node=1000001964 ) ( table 9.1 ) . 
  outside of uk debit vs credit payments are magnitude , or two magnitudes lower . 
  for instance : belgium 60 bln euro ( debit ) vs 0.27 bln euro ( credit ) or sweden 66 bln vs 9 bln and so on , and so on . 
  most people in europe do n't have credit cards , to be honest . 
  we do n't need them . 
  we have debit cards . 
  i do n't recall anyone with credit card , we are not , generally , `` credit culture '' . 
  first one is enforced everywhere afaik . 
  it 's automated system , so in reality it 's basically no hassle for google to use ( obviously outside of `` processing power '' , but in case of google i doubt this is problem ) . 
  you like it so much that you ate `` e '' there . 
  it 's zapiekanki  they are everywhere , they are cheap and unique . 
  you should find kefir pretty easily in polish shops in uk from what i know ( especially if you live in a city with bigish polish community ) . 
  i know about [ this shop chain in ni ] ( http://www.karolina-shop.co.uk/?product=kefir-naturalny-1l-0-99szt ) , but it looks like you can even find it in some tescos . 
  it depends what do we mean by learning languages . 
  you can go pretty far by learning via internet , but you are rather limited with availability of speaking ( like person to person ) with other people . 
  if you want to go further in some countries it can be pretty expensive . 
  looking at language school in my city it can cost over 1500 pln for a course , more if it 's course for some kind of certificate ( like cae , or fce ) . 
  it goes exponentially more expensive for courses for individuals . 
  tl ; dr : it depends what they mean by `` learning '' /, 
  how you can even compare the two ? 
  you pay * every time * when you buy a milk , the more availability they have the more probable is that you will buy it . 
  it 's not even close to distribution of media . 
  it would n't make them more money . 
  quite contrary - it woul n't make netflix any money . 
  no one would buy expensive ( or even cheap ) rights to the series * without some kind of exclusivity . 
  there would be no point - it would `` blur '' viewership between different channels . 
  * obviously if we are talking about new shows , not `` second run '' . 
  but problem is different . 
  in many countries netflix cost is comparable to decent cable company package ( even excluding bundled packages with internet ) . 
  and roughly for twice the cost of standard netflix you can get 100 mb/s internet + 161 channels + 45 channels available on-line . 
  if you look at this that way netflix is not so good deal in many parts of eu . 
  deals with other distributors . 
  house of cards was/is distributed in poland by canal + / nc + . 
  netflix rushed the move to expand in other markets and fucked it up pretty badly , at least from my perspective . 
  between selling licences , generally rather bad library , no support of local languages and somewhat unreasonable prices in some countries there is no chance that they `` conquer '' any meaningful part of the market . 
  i said it just after they rolled out and it looks like i was right . 
  the problem here is that he goes into slap fights with people . 
  i do n't care as much about social media , but people are doing there things that they would n't do in real life and it 's especially weird for `` public people '' . 
   richard dawkins tweets but he really should be , hmm ... less active on twitter . 
  it 's problem with `` experts '' - they may be really good at one thing , but rest is just weird . 
  it 's just off-handed remark , i know you are talking about more serious issues that we should concentrate on .
