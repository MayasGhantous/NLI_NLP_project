  it 's not like people ca n't write it . 
  metro universe is rather `` open source '' . 
  altough that title probably would n't fly , `` metro [ year ] '' is basically reserved for `` main '' series by glukhovsky , but you can always write `` return of the ice vikings '' . 
  and you treat it like it 's something * really * new . 
  people are jizzing all over this movie like it 's child of godfather and pianist , but it 's just another mass produced crap . 
  it may be good crap , but crap nonetheless . 
  and you are saying that `` point of the comedy is different '' , like breaking the fourth wall is [ new ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/breakingthefourthwall/film ) , especially in comedies . 
  so ... another superhero movie , just with little more comedy ? 
  it 's not the first movie of that type . 
  who are `` we '' in your apology ? 
  can i come in , too ? 
  i will bring kabanosy * and w\u00f3dka . 
  * because i see that they are gaining popularity in the uk edit : because letters are hard, 
  there is over 550 [ solaris urbino 12 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris_urbino_12_na_%c5%9bwiecie ) buses in germany ( plus on top of that another 500 of solaris urbino 18 and few solaris alpino ) . 
  hell , germany is biggest outside importer of solaris buses . 
  they are definitely cheaper than mercedes and comfort depends mostly on company that is buying them . 
  it looks very similar to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szczekociny_rail_crash ) train crash in poland in 2012 , altough background is slightly different . 
  in the end it was chain of events that led to this :  the investigation revealed that a series of five mistakes caused the collision : ( 1 ) a switch malfunctioned and the traffic controller at starzyny used a subsidiary signal , sending the southbound train ( ir 13126 matejko ) on a wrong track instead of making the change manually , ( 2 ) the traffic controller failed to observe the moving train and informed his colleague at sprowa post that the train proceeded on the correct track , ( 3 ) the driver of that train obeyed the subsidiary signal even though it conflicted with other signalling . 
  almost simultaneously , ( 4 ) the traffic controller at sprowa noticed that the signal showed busy track yet she presumed that the safety system had malfunctioned and permitted northbound tlk 31100 brzechwa to continue . 
  finally , ( 5 ) the driver of tlk 31100 brzechwa also failed to obey conflicting signalling and continued . 
  similarly if dispatcher knew that he made mistake he could use radio-stop ( automatic ( if possible for given train ) stop for everyone in range of dispatcher ) . 
  you probably just did n't watch carefully . 
  it was here before at least few times . 
  for me , personally , [ this ] ( http://cdn.doradcasmaku.pl/dynamic/92/0f/5e/bf/9fa84be6cf46f05dd9aa16fb/dsc05828_fit-800-600.jpg ) are mine little lies today , or `` ma\u0142e k\u0142amstewka '' ( altough not `` traditionally '' fat thursday sweets , but sweet is a sweet , right ? ), 
  `` little lies '' ? 
  like `` i did n't eat them , i do n't know where they are '' sort of lies ? 
  it looks more like regular bun/breadroll with jam . 
  not enough fat , mate . 
  you could nitpick some other details , but if there is nothing better it would be probably the best choice . 
  you obviously mean nale\u015bniki , right ? 
  [ `` light '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) , right ? 
  you are looking by very narrow scope of what happened after ww2 , but do n't take into account anything else . 
  and what about [ them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cursed_soldiers ) ? 
  many were not really tried in court . 
  he said crazy . 
  while people here may be rather conservative many are not * really * crazy . 
  on top of that they are catholics , contrary to many , many weird american protestant denominations . 
  brits do n't go to usa for parties . 
  you ca n't just take a plane for couple euros and land in nyc . 
  it 's completly different level of expenses . 
  i 'm not talking about this , but what / u/absurdiskas posted . 
  why would i ask him about op if he posted different picture ? 
  come on , man . 
  what am i missing here ? 
  i just see sticker put there by some idiot . 
  edit : i see now . 
  what this have to do with europe ? 
  come on , you do n't need theme park for that . 
  you could find similar groups of people almost anywhere in big cities . 
  hell , you do n't even need particularly big city . 
  but like you [ proved ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42yw9z/man_saves_money_on_train_fare_by_flying_from/czf21ov ) in your own post , there are better places to reduce co2 and greenhouse gases than flying , especially by silly taxation . 
  cutting emission of greenhouse gases in energy production by 20 % would be as effective as stopping all the planes . 
  invisible hand of the market would solve the problem , [ right ] ( http://images2.dailykos.com/i/user/30549/cartoon_by_tom_tomorrow_-_the_invisible_hand_strikes_again.jpg ) ? 
  just do what * you * think is right and rest will solve itself ... or will it ? 
  ok , so we cut out cars and you still do n't have better places to cut out emission than people doing their jobs ? 
  i would rather go with solving problem of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/be%c5%82chat%c3%b3w_power_station ) lovely place . 
  or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hazelwood_power_station ) . 
  or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edwardsport,_indiana ) . 
  or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niederaussem_power_station ) . 
  or i would go for change of behaviour in the usa and canada , because their average energy consumption is much higher than in many european countries . 
  instead of creating some weird barriers against people doing their jobs solve [ real problems ] ( http://www.cedexis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/giant-traffic-jam.jpg ) . 
  lower the demand of * unnecessary * travel , not one that 's really needed . 
  that 's biggest bs i 've seen in a long time . 
  it would mean that you would need to create jobs for relatively niche market across whole world . 
  instead of few people doing their jobs you would have people that work once , maybe twice a year . 
  but what about people that rely on flying for their jobs ? 
  i know at least few people that need to fly . 
  there is a guy who took 7 planes in 3 days , because he needs to be mobile around europe/world . 
  wait , you are arguing the difference of 0.3 homicides per 100k people here ? 
  really ? 
  with that logic you have over 20 % homicides more than in switzerland . 
  20 % man !, 
  it 's even worse !, 
  you have almost 100 % more homicides than japan . 
  almost twice as much !, 
  edit : letter, 
  i 'm not talking about relative wealth to countries they are fleeing/migrating from . 
  i 'm talking about real life , like mentioned by / u/wolfiasty [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42r2g7/minister_poland_will_veto_forced_relocation_of/czcjdk0 ) . 
  it 's like saying that poland is tourist destination for americans , because few actually visit our country . 
   europe as a whole is still a destination not really , no . 
  definitely not europe , western europe - maybe , and even then not whole . 
  [ google says this ] ( http://i1.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3261639.ece/alternates/s615b/cp19628066.jpg ) * * ok , ok , it 's in fifth row on image searches , but it 's there . 
  i would say that many italian cities have exonyms in different languages . 
  i ca n't say for finland , but in poland many , many cities have either `` transcripted name '' , or `` proper '' exonym * * / r/badlinguistics do n't hit me , i do n't know how to better describe it . 
  i bet that daily mail would be very happy  you definitely need more of us . 
  naaah , i 'm joking . 
  it 's similar in tourist oriented cities in poland , too , especially krakow . 
  it 's not * really * bad , but you have to keep your head on the shoulders , like in rush hours in public transport when everything is crowded . 
  but you still should avoid english stag parties/bachelores . 
   the nhs funding has been increased in real terms aa well but we have a population that is measurably older on average then we did even 7 years ago and old people are expensive . 
  does it mean that you need more young poles ? 
  should i pack my bags now ? 
  i would n't even go as far as saying that in language families it would be the same , it depends what influenced the word . 
  for instance in poland `` obywatel '' ( citizen ) was codified in [ statues of lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statutes_of_lithuania ) . 
  `` obywatel '' was translation from latin de cive and contrary to some other countries it covered * all * the people equally . 
  so when `` latin root '' may be the same - word itself may be not close . 
   little bit street smart you mean avoid hooligans and english `` tourists '' ? 
  last ( type of ) bot is pretty common on reddit and you can see if you are browsing / new . 
  other i 've seen post in the manner : [ subreddit name ] text . 
  i 'm not sure anyone can really do anything about it , at least not automatically .
