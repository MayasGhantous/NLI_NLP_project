  in poland we had satirical [ polska partia przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 piwa ( polish beer-lovers ' party ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party ) , so ... there 's that . 
  they even had few seats in sejm . 
  on the bright side they would have call centres on the same continent ^ ( i 'm sorry ), 
  yeah , those pesky italians !, 
  that 's weird . 
  even in my small town you can buy 20 mbit/s for 67 pln and they are rolling out fiber rather agresively ( 250 mbit/s for 67 pln ) . 
  it 's really hard to take one place . 
  if i could i would rather choose general region of greater poland , but for one specific city i will still go with gniezno , because it was more recognizable place outside of poland ( topped with congress in 1000 ) . 
  for poland it would probably be [ gniezno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gniezno ) . 
  i 'm talking about more direct contact than `` knowing that country exists '' . 
  i 'm talking about `` constant relations '' , like between poland/slavs and germany that influenced the name `` niemcy '' ( or similar in other slavic languages ) . 
  i think it 's name that is easy to adopt in many languages ( with small changes due to local grammar/rules ) . 
  and on top of that portugal was somewhat `` locked away '' , so many countries did n't have very early contacts that could influence the name . 
  if ` death in paradise ' taught me anything about french people speaking english is that you just need to listen bit more carefully and everything will be ok . 
  by many people you mean ... americans ? 
   because ` tsp ' would be impossible to pronounce . 
  somehow i do n't believe you . 
  you should just try harder . 
  how is `` e '' and `` i '' easy to mishear ? 
  especially in slavic languages . 
  it will be very similar in slavic languages . 
  in polish it would be either - a , or - y ( maybe some `` other '' , but i do n't recall any from top of my head ) . 
  edit : outside of europe there would definitely be - o ( like kongo ) and in europe in `` other '' would fall bia\u0142oru\u015b and watykan . 
  so that 's how it works , there is few hooligans and rest is there just by accident / s, 
  what are you buying that is not supported by przelewy24 and you need virtual card ? 
  and question is : should people accomodate netflix , or should netflix accomodate people ? 
  in poland the biggest part of online payments is done probably by [ przelewy24 ] ( https://www.przelewy24.pl/en ) . 
  it 's similar to what / u/toreon described , but bit bigger ( due to number of banks , etc ) . 
  virtually every bank is supporting it ( basically every major bank you can think about in poland ) , it 's instant payment ( compared to normal money transfer , which can take few hours ) , basically hassle free and bit safer than using credit/debit cards . 
  edit : if netflix want to go somewhere in poland they should support it from the get-go . 
  cheap ? 
  maybe in some parts of europe , but not in basically any new country . 
  while in many places it 's fraction of the price of basic cable , it 's not here . 
  not english language ... some people - maybe . 
  maybe it has massive red pig on it , because , well , it 's `` ad '' for ober\u017ca pod czerwonym wieprzem . 
  it is quite long , [ 850m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falowiec ) + 11 stories . 
  but investements like that needs decades . 
  they were build for over 40 years , there are whole districts that are centered around this type of buildings ( probably most known in poland would be [ nowa huta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nowa_huta ) ) . 
  so while there are new investements all the time your idea of `` expansion/urbanization/gentrification '' is bit out of time , at least for near future . 
  yeah , they need to go and people will live ... where ? 
  you clearly do n't understand that for many people it is only option and building new apartament buildings would be incredibely expensive . 
  but why title given by artist is different that title , or nickname given by someone else ? 
  it 's as valuable source of information about history and `` state of mind '' as what it portrays . 
  no one made that joke yet ? 
   warsaw | poland  circus  cyrk na wiejskiej but at least it 's nice inside . 
   whilst the leds are rated for 10 years and remain 100 % efficient not really . 
  this will of course depend on environment and other external factors , but l70 of leds ( l70 - lumen output equal to 70 % of specified `` starting '' output ) is between 30 000-70 000 ( for white leds , depends on source of information ) and 250 000 hours ( for orange leds ) . 
  in best case scenario after 10 years it will be still in great condition , but it wo n't be 100 % efficient ( compared to new one ) . 
  it is possible , they wo n't be in same colour temperature as `` regular '' lightbulbs , or sodium-vapour lights , but they are much , much better than this . 
  edit : a letter edit2 : even more letters !, 
  weirdly enough everyone knows what 's going on , because it 's pretty recognizable name . 
  euro 2016 ? 
  not him , but roughly [ that 's ] ( http://www.przepisy.rzeszow.pl/sites/default/files/images/karp_smazony_2.jpg ) how it looks in poland , give or take ( i know , it 's not the biggest picture , but it 's surprisingly hard to find `` traditional '' carp ) . 
  and how it tastes ? 
  it depends on cook . 
  many people do n't really know how to properly cook it ( or more precisely : prepare before frying ) , so it can be earthy/muddy . 
  if done right it 's almost generic fish . 
  ( i hope i did my math right ), 
  we definitely need even smaller pictures , like it 's 1995 . what year is it ? 
  but you know that works both ways , right ? 
  but there is difference between `` public condemnation '' and laws . 
  of course we should discuss it , we should discuss if it fits in our worldview , but should we have specific laws targeting one specific group of people ? 
  and authorities would do nothing , because no one is breaking laws . 
  and ... what 's shitty about that map ? 
  and prices are sometimes little off , too ( at least judged based on krak\u00f3w ) . 
  if we do n't count any student 's discounts you have to add 50 % to most prices listed and another 50 % if you are not the aiming for `` surviving the trip '' , but actually enjoying it . 
  shit , they even are off on ticket prices by ~ 30 %, 
  from what i can see on wiki :  debate continues among muslim jurists and the general muslim population about whether or not stunning , anesthetics , or other forms of inducing unconsciousness in the animal prior to slaughter are permissible per islam . 
   you have to cut the main artery of the neck first because that means the animal will die quickly without much suffering , the animal should n't have died beforehand but the big problem with this is that animal does n't die neither quickly , nor without much suffering . 
  in theory [ unnecessary cruelty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_aspects_of_ritual_slaughter#european_union ) is banned in eu with ... exception for religions . 
  for me this looks like landing pad for poorly designed space ship ... 
  but there is problem with this concept , it only measures speed , not anything else . 
  if you have public wifi in one place with 100/100 speeds you will be higher than country that have coverage in all big cities with 50/50 speeds . 
  it 's definitely not eu regulations . 
  for instance there is public wifi in rzesz\u00f3w covering ~ 50 % of city with 512 kbit/s limit ( and in future plans it will be upgraded to wimax with better coverage ) and it 's in 75 % funded by eu . 
  and there is whole aero2 project with free 3g ( up to 512 kb/s , too ) covering 99 % of poland . 
   which is n't accurate . 
  so give us accurate source of the map and what it represents . 
   it starts to become annoying , it seems that you did n't read what i wrote . 
  i acknowledged that , i was aware of this from the start . 
  so ... why did you post it if you knew it was not the best map of `` baroque in europe '' ? 
   however a lot of your criticism is n't as good as you think . 
  and you think that your defense of this map is flawless . 
  you move goalpost all the time , from `` baroque art in europe '' to `` simplified map of baroque in europe '' , to `` representation of counterreformation as a main source of baroque art in europe '' . 
  you are reading too much into this . 
  i said it does n't matter who i am , because it 's bad map . 
  you can see similar accusation from other countries . 
  and if we take into account what / u/ihidemei found ( that it was first published in 1978 ) it perfectly fits into `` west vs. east '' narrative during cold war . 
  it 's whig history of xx century . 
   `` you 're just a polish nationalist who is n't happy about how is country is represented . 
  you do n't really care about this map , you just want to show that poland is a big country '' does it really matter if i 'm nationalist who is unhappy about representation of poland , or just normal guy , if this map could easily land in / r/badhistory ? 
  or even better , / r/badhistory2 , because it really does n't need explanation why it 's bad . 
   you could have pointed it out where i did it . 
  ad hominem 1 : so it means that your knowledge of czech borders is as good as your use of capital letters . 
  ad hominem 2 : i should probably have guessed with the way you used the english language . 
   the fact that you do n't like something does n't mean it 's bad or misleading . 
  it does n't matter if i like it , or not . 
  your title and your map are two different things , but it perfectly fits into post-war narrative of backwards poland . 
  from the other hand , what can i expect from frenchman ? ^ 1 ^ ( 1 ) *** this *** is my first ad hominem . 
  the fact that you do n't know what [ ad hominem ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem ) is , is annoying for me .
