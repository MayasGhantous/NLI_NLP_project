  oh , yeah , and [ tu quoque ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque ) . 
  so ... in the bigger scheme of things you knew that 's misleading map , you posted it and now you feel the need to defend it . 
  what is my point ? 
  that this map have nothing to do with spread of baroque art . 
  so it 's not `` baroque art in europe '' , but `` cherrypicked examples of baroque art in europe to fit my view about counterreformation '' . 
  you found lazy map and now you are looking for excuses . 
   so i wonder how much time you looked at the map . 
  long enough to see that there is almost nothing east of oder . 
  that 's why i 'm still asking : what this map represents , because it 's not `` baroque art in europe '' . 
   the point is that there are hundreds of buildings , you ca n't all indicate them ( well you can with our current technologies but it would n't look like that ) . 
  exactly , you ca n't indicate them all , but poland have whole three dots and nothing more , even that there is a lot of them . 
  your map basically ends on oder with few things thrown here and there . 
  polan ca n't into ~ ~ space ~ ~ baroque ? 
  and about other part ...  yes , i did . 
  look at where they are things indicated . 
  yeah , it does n't answer my question , because it 's not as simple as `` baroque only thrived in places with counter-reformation '' . 
  it still does n't explain why this map is bad . 
  you still did n't answer my question . 
  i know history of baroque ( maybe on layman level , but still ) , i do n't know what your picture represents . 
  it either is misleading , or . . it 's misleading . 
  you would need * at least * few `` red triangles '' in poland and czech republic , both for architecture and art as a whole . 
  even in my small town we have late baroque church , without even counting rest of [ poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/architektura_barokowa_w_polsce ) . 
  but what does it * really * represents ? 
  it does n't give `` simple idea '' , because it 's missing many things , so it ca n't show `` spread of baroque in europe '' . 
  it misses many things in central/eastern europe where baroque was quite popular . 
  estonia , do you need . . * tree * ? 
  we can send some , if you want . 
  but in many cases , i think , it depends on definition of `` city '' in given country . 
  so in one country it 's rahter `` customary '' , in other it will have to fall into certain criteria . 
  it looks like every other clickbait . 
  looking at a problem from one perspective is never a good thing . 
  are electic cars better in the bigger scheme of things ? 
  today and probably in near future - no . 
  range of electric cars are still not comparable to ices , they still need charging ( even with `` fast charging technology '' it 's bit of a mess . 
  it still needs big breakthrough , or batteries that you can easily replace ) . 
  and we do n't even take into account that electricity needs to come from somewhere and most of the countries are not 100 % based on clean energy ( be that `` green '' , or nuclear ) . 
  you still do n't know definition of that word , do n't you ? 
  i 'm nice and i will point you directions , just go [ here ] ( https://www.wiktionary.org/ ), 
  why ? 
  it 's nice past-time . 
  after i done my part of cebuling on internet ( creating account on paysafe * for 15 pln ) so now it 's time for some trolls . 
  they are like mietek spod sklepu , but on the internet . 
  * paysafe is not so safe ... they did goofed pretty badly , but it 's story for another time . 
  yes . 
  and there is no `` mine '' and `` yours '' definition of words . 
  terrorist have one meaning and it 's very , very simple . 
  hint for you : it 's in root of that word . 
  you are using that word , but you still do n't know what it means . 
  do you know what terrorist even mean ? 
  you are using that word , but ... 
  i 'm not affraid of drivers , nor call them `` terrorist '' . 
  i really do n't want to start debate what is and what is n't sport . 
  people will come with some arbitrary rules and will defend it to the last drop of blood . 
  it 's not * really * team sport . 
  and what next ? 
  should we ship them to friendly place , like guantanamo ? 
  on top of that he is talking about all criminals , not only terrorists . 
  keep in mind that laws vary from [ country ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d68981bb948d47c88e259cb149f55cc2/french-jihadi-network-chief-sentenced-9-years-prison ) to [ country ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/oct/02/anzac-day-terror-plot-british-teenager-given-life-sentence ) . 
  putting `` us '' in one basket is wrong . 
  so what 's your advice here , exactly ? 
  should we betray our values and restore corporal and capital punishements ? 
  should we treat certain people differently ? 
  `` lax with criminals '' ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  because we are using our laws it does n't mean we are `` lax with criminals '' . 
  what should we do ? 
  should we use our old prangers ? 
  20 million refugees ? 
  do you know what refugee means ? 
  without a country for centuries ? 
  maybe he is american in disguise ? 
  they love flags everywhere . 
  but many dacias . 
  and at least one matiz . 
  and ... where is the problem , exactly ? 
  from the other hand you have weirdos like [ that ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/10/14/d-c-church-says-a-bike-lane-would-infringe-upon-its-constitutional-rights-of-religious-freedom/ ) . 
  they will defend cars by any means necessary . 
  heroes like [ pilecki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) ? 
  and like others said , contrary to rest of the occupied territories here it was dead penalty . 
   for example , after ww2 ended polish jews were not exactly treated nicely either . 
  yeah ... because our government was fully democratic and everyone is responsible for that . 
  it 's not black and white , there was video where guy asked random people in tel aviv ( i think ) what they think about poles and many described as almost like we were nazis . 
  it invalidates data . 
  it 's not percentage of marriages that ends in divorce . 
  it 's taking * all * divorces and compares it to * current * marriages . 
  if overall number of new marriages is low it will drive up the percentage . 
  you should compare number of all married couples to divorces . 
  let 's say you have only 10 new marriages in given year and 100 divorces - this would mean that it 's 1000 % divorce rate and it 's simply not true . 
  so if you are that clumsy and `` energy aware '' maybe it 's time for leds ? 
  and realistically , how many did you break ? 
  in my whole lifetime i broke 0 . 
  [ can confirm ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/2/10073/m10073282,jo110805-pano01a.jpg ), 
  it looks like i need a bit more activity to see it here , in southern part of poland . 
  but there is a chance . 
  small . 
  very small . 
  i 'm talking about broader perspective , not dunkirk specifically . 
  look at other ww ii movies , even excluding movies about pacific theatre . 
  i 'm not sure if he means that in this way . 
  i would rather say that american movies glorify american soldiers and push aside every other nation in ww ii .
