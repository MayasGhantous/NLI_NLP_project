  i know they are not documentaries , but definitely are very biased and some of them could be called propaganda . 
  no , no , no . 
  it 's * the english way * . 
  i would say slash half of the countries from the list so your trip will be at least slightly enjoyable . 
  slash another half so it will be enjoyable . 
  10 countries in 4 weeks is way too many . 
  it 's really hard to put whole country in one basket here . 
  generally speaking it follows age and city vs countryside lines . 
  25ish living in the city will probably use mostly cashless payments ( and if possible contactless ) , while 60 years old from village will use exclusively money . 
  tl ; dr : infrastructure for cashless payments is there , but not mentality for everyone . 
  majority of my purchases is done with debit card ( wherever i can contactless ) . 
  he knows , he already changed it . 
  yeah , it 's the same here . 
  it 's one of those fruits that no one knows where it comes from . 
  it 's always there ( during the season ) , but no one is simply buying it , it magically appears , contrary to other fruits ( often seasonal , just like blackcurrant ) . 
  in simplest words : money transfers , since they are cheap ( free ) and instantaneous ( for majority of banks and definitely the biggest ones accepted by payment providers ) . 
  generally payment providers shifted slightly in recent ( ish ) past , because payu became majority player ( due to connections to our biggest online auction/shop site ) marginalising przelewy24 ( former biggest/most popular provider ) , dotpay and probably few others . 
  on top of that we have something called blik that may be used for online payments , but it needs smartphone ( in simple words : you generate 6 digits ( iirc ) code in your bank 's app , then you put the code in the box , proceed with payment and confirm it in your app . 
  obviously for security reasons codes are short lived , iirc 90 seconds ) . 
  and some people are using paypal for foreign purchases since it 's instant and basically hassle free ( including transferring money to paypal , again with money transfer ) . 
  good , good , krak\u00f3w is much better that way ( a.k.a. 
  less stag parties ) . 
  is n't this only case in mobile internet ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that `` landline '' internet has better protection ( and is in 99 % cases without data caps , so this `` workaround '' would n't even work ) . 
  that one . 
  and lobsters . 
  it really depends . 
  in case of numbers - bigger the number = higher probability of `` verbalising '' it in polish . 
  [ again ? 
  ] ( https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/983/232/large/jakub-rozalski-warsaw-rising44-jr.jpg ), 
  never heard about brands you mentioned . 
  and popularity is different for different demographics , there is no way of saying that particular brand is popular for everyone ( outside of big four : reebok , nike , adidas , puma ) . 
  it may be more of `` our side of iron curtain '' thing , since summer camps ( known as `` kolonia '' here ) were heavily subsidised in big companies ( and often still are ) - i assume it was similar in czech . 
  nope , never seen it . 
  kapu\u015bniak ? 
  no / s. 
  he ca n't be true ~ ~ scotsman ~ ~ pole . 
  it 's way too many staple foods . 
  i really do n't know why . 
  it 's definitely acquired taste , but if prepared well is really , really tasty . 
  no true pole !, 
  it does n't really matter if it 's aave / `` black people thing '' if it was hijacked to push ... certain rhetoric . 
  i would dare to say that 's not true anymore . 
  maybe it 's not as bad as other places on the internet , but it 's still 1/4 posts about politics and comment section is even worse . 
  they do , but they like to stir the shit around the internet and they see poland as `` last bastion '' in europe . 
  we are `` woke '' and all that right wing newspeak . 
  they are even more active since le pen was thrashed in french elections . 
  still better than / r/poland with trumpists , murican alt-right and local right wingers . 
  again , things like that are paid for with our taxes ( and the few things that are paid by students , like dormitories ) . 
  and keep in mind that students ( at least in poland ) have perks that are `` sponsored '' indirectly by other branches of government ( including local one ) , like subsidised transportation within the city and by trains/buses . 
  not really , no . 
  there may be quite a lot of banter between students from different universities in given city , but they are still just schools . 
  contrary , i do n't trust anyone . 
  i 'm not sure that we have anything nowadays ( due to slightly stricter regulations and , generally , it seems that it 's easier in fptp voting ) . 
  also que jokes about our political scene . 
  in the past we had [ partia przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 piwa/beer lover 's party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_beer-lovers%27_party?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  i would say that this number includes also `` mild intolerance '' , basically without any symptoms . 
  it really depends ... 
  but i would say something like [ viva la wita ( imperial witbier ) ] ( http://blog.kopyra.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/viva-la-wita2.jpg ) , [ hoplaaga ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rd8ygddrvuy/vuli89u-ybi/aaaaaaaads4/68gxnykgi-0ynccxpb2ixcofhnvq-hqfw/s1600/pinta_hoplaaga.jpg ) , or [ hopken hopken ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gbgqhbc-8se/wmkgk44r3ji/aaaaaaaaxf0/lnmfmmjaeqke-rtr-htkpjw9v5zghv7ogclcb/s1600/dsc03840.jpg ) . 
  generally during summer i lean towards beers brewed with unusual ingredients . 
  dead . 
  appliance is definitely dead . 
  and generally i definitely would n't do it for things like that ( with heavy load ) . 
  12,5 litres/100 km in other metrics . 
  i think you should check etymology behind the name before you start talking about things like that . 
  `` great patriotic war '' is propaganda/stretching definitions , your `` civil war '' is completely misusing the term ( and some would use much harsher words ) . 
  that 's ... that 's genius comparison . 
  i will repeat what i said not so long ago in other subreddit : people like you should read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/how_not_to_be_wrong?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  is it a sarcasm ? 
  fecking paradoxes everywhere !, 
  in general , i would say , sarcasm is unknown in europe . 
  it 's one of this `` american things '' that we do n't get here ( like guns . 
  and freedom . 
  and overpriced health care ) . 
  [ i will say nothing else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1dnqkguezo ) . 
  i would say that interwar period could be great topic for a movie ( s ) ( like i 'm often championing - our war with russia then is often unknown in the west , but it 's quite important ) . 
  but as a tv series fan i would say that `` rise and fall of commonwealth '' could be amazing series rivaling `` rome '' , `` the tudors '' , `` marco polo '' , or other historical series . 
  they were still a thing in early 2000 ? 
  shit ... 
  do you have to ask rhetoric questions like that ? 
  but you know that teams have nicknames , right ? 
  name is official , not `` generic '' , contrary to `` catchy '' franchise names ( as artificial as many things in franchise based sports ) . 
   it was proposed few times and i do n't remember any big uproar aside from worker unions proposed by who ? 
  not really , no . 
  whoever would even suggest something like this would commit political suicide . 
  we bitch about our health care , but we understand that we need it . 
  not really , because maintenance * is part of deal here , so whoever presents the best deal wins . 
  on top of that consolidation is not really an answer , neither due to different demands from a cars in different regions , nor from simple putting all eggs in one basket . 
  * for projected life of the car . 
  we do , but it 's done on case by case basis . 
  every `` batch '' of cars may be from different car company if they meet demands specified by komenda g\u0142\u00f3wna policji ( `` police headquarters '' ) . 
  there is no one , typical police car . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.czerwonesamochody.com/categories.php?cat_id=2 ) may be somewhat helpful , but it also includes historical cars/vehicles . 
  really ? 
  and i thought that i have mediocre plan : 5.5 gb ( lte ) , unlimited minutes and sms for around 12 $ ( give or take , really . 
  depends on current $ to pln ) . 
  where did you make wrong turn , southern brothers ? 
  mate , i 'm quite active in / r/shitamericanssay , i know what your countrymen are capable of . 
  that 's why i 'm pointing out that you are twisting my words and trying to spin it against me . 
  that kind of whataboutism and word twisting is not new for me .
