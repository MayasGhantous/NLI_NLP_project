  thanks . 
  vanilla is still great . 
  night in this game is scary and beautifull at the same time . 
  ** ireland : ** beautiful piece of land filled with great people . 
  especialy loved country side . 
  never expected such friendlines and hard to explain felling of equality all around . 
  enjoyed pubs at night filled with whole families having great time playing lottery and causally drinking guinness beer . 
  after that as an cherry on top i had pleasure to visit achill island . 
  poland can not into space , but can into ireland and it 's good enough replacement for me !, 
  ( not only to ` steal ' your jobs  ) ** ukraine : ** ( soon eu ) . 
  awesome people . 
  great to work and drink with !, 
  stunning and independent women .

  i hope that in the end we will recover some of ours ` explorers ' .

  i think self hate is just another topic used in small talk . 
  next to weather and how bad mondays are . 
  it looks like this article is from 2007 . 
  also not much detail about the survey itself . 
  as you said `` they do n't need persecution , they need education . '' . 
  stupid mistake not worth hurting our relationship . 
  they already said sorry and explained why they did it . 
  quick translation : `` we sincerely apologize for our photo with a upa flag in galeria sanow . 
  we did n't want to suggest fascism or racism ... we are not `` bandera 's people '' . 
  we are one nation ( brotherhood ! ) . 
  we all have polish roots and whole families here in poland . 
  we only wanted to support our nation . '', 
  kind of peaceful , if we compare to `` cross gate '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfyodfg_i-k i hope it will end on protests alone . 
  i ca n't wait for : * `` history with maury povich '' * . 
  poland ... you are a father ... of the holocaust . 
  * `` whose holocaust it 's anyway '' * with poland , germany , russia and special guest hungary . 
  let 's have some fun !, 
  snark mode disengaged . 
  i think we should just ask about clarification and do n't take offense if we are even mentioned in same paragraph with `` germany '' and `` holocaust '' . 
  especially in this case where his comments were n't targeted at given country but just generally at human nature : * `` in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil . 
  they convinced themselves it was the right thing to do , the thing they had to do . 
  that 's what people do . 
  and that should truly frighten us . 
  this is just sad . 
  nice number !, 
  do you want to come over ? 
  i can see it clearly, 
  brute force, 
  i was n't expecting that many . 
  is it normal number for nye , or did it increase lately ? 
  amazing !, 
  holy f *** . 
  so beautiful !, 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  need to watch ` bandyta ' now . 
  ok , so i have new favorite rendition . 
  long time passed from my last listening of bregovic & kayah album . 
  it still holds up : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqxrm8rpo4s, 
  i like first one . 
  what he is singing about ? 
  amazing !, 
  my favorite is one of many renditions of ederlezi : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou--ox25dco, 
  amazing music !, 
  both percival and warduna . 
  my favorite track so far : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqx3mx0nelm&amp;index=3&amp;list=pl3c86d37db2339a90 do you maybe know what 's language that they use in this song ? 
   more rapist immigrants lol are you single , 
  this is from 2013 . 
  in latest version they dropped isds , and will create new body from scratch . 
  there is also mention of limits on awards , then can not outgrow contract benefits . 
  however , not sure how lightly this one will be interpreted . 
  if contract was for given sum of money , then it 's easy . 
  but if it will not be fixed , then it means nothing . 
  version you posted is from 2014 . 
  [ 2016 february ] . 
  ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154329.pdf ) it would be interesting to see what they changed in almost 2 years . 
  * creation of body that will be lobbying on behalf of corp. whenever new legislation is in work . 
  at least february version had it . 
  not sure about final one , as it 's not yet public . 
  or maybe it did n't change . 
  i did n't know that . 
  thanks . 
  isds is owned by world bank . 
  idss is supposed to be created from scratch . 
  there will be also new body created that will lobby on behalf of corp whenever new legislature is introduced . 
  i think in case of eu and canada , members should be quite safe , as in the end everything is guarded by eu . 
  looking at isds , canada lost few of the proceedings : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/investor-state_dispute_settlement#cases_lost_by_government ecuador was also charged with $ 2.4 bln . 
  their yearly budget for 2015 was $ 34.9 . 
  it 's around 7 % of their budget . 
  that 's huge chunk of money . 
  sure , but public got to see the details far of in a process . 
  and a lot of gov members got scarred after all that outcry and actually focused more on details . 
  same happened with tpp and hillary . 
  until it got more visibility and people voiced concerns , all was good and dandy . 
  so in the end , maybe ceta was n't as opaque as tpp , but eu for sure should spend more time explaining and advertising it to people , as they do with other their big decisions . 
  people won :p, 
  i 've never been verbally or physically abused because of my country of origin . 
  at least in person .
