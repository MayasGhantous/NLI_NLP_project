  this is his `` thing '' . 
  oh , pitty a day without casual holocaust jokes / s, 
  [ oh you ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/204/captainamerica1_zps8c295f96.jpg ), 
  humble servants of god . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/archbishop_chrysostomos.jpg 3 chainz . 
  ours was sad he was rescued . 
  so for sure polish wolf . 
  in comparison to other events in eu like earthquake in italy . 
  it 's in my book still part of bulshit category . 
  however it is big news here an many people suffered because of it . 
  generally nothing . 
  blissful nothingness . 
  small things : * [ boris johnson visited us . 
  he was trapped in a well ] ( http://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,632209,wydobyty-ze-studni-wilk-trafil-do-kliniki-dla-zwierzat.html ) * some bullshit regarding land ownership in warsaw, 
  [ how cute  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hiirm.png ) he meant us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe#/media/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg, 
  love for purity . 
  which was the name of his favorite pussy cat . 
  thank you !, 
  you probably have children of your own . 
  for me seeing someone decapitated and squeaking/gurgling like a pig is far more disturbing . 
  and what if afterwards they will require you to remove your traditional [ polish tourist attire ] ( http://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2013/04/87733c6b368ff99dbbfdc0b9889f6d19_original.jpg ), 
  so we should fucking hate germans for eternity . 
  5 mln poles were killed in ww2 . 
  we know better . 
  they had bad few years , everybody has their ` period of supremacy ' . 
  they changed , a little to much , but they are now our besties . 
  i think whole issue is not that simple . 
  there a lot of muslims without a fault . 
  sharing mostly cultural part of their religion ( clothing , events , etc. ) . 
  i think we need to take that into consideration , otherwise it 's sad to see careless people getting shit on for no particular reason . 
  that hurts . 
  but it 's fun . 
  and hurt 's at the same time . 
  looks like something from ghost in the shell or halo . 
  i hope you meant fighting with words  i 'm not used to it !, 
  i want fucking peace . 
  heroes die in front of generals . 
  and generals go home . 
  hehehehehehe . 
  hussary riding on solaris buses . 
  i would pay to see such war . 
  not in poland , maybe this time we will change shooting location . 
  why you are sorry ? 
  do you actually know how much we get from eu . 
  and how much we get from other countries ? 
  not only eu help us economically . 
  and what is our yearly budget ? 
  it 's good , but in the and everybody pays their share . 
  if poland gets better economy , it pays higher monthly/yearly . 
  nobody argues that eu was n't catalyst for us . 
  but at the same time it 's not like putting money in your mouth to shut you up . 
  there is an immigration problem and we need to solve it . 
  how , i 've no idea . 
  but i hope people that should think about it will solve it . 
  currently , it 's political fan fest . 
  instead of solving the issue , people advertise their ideologies , like religion . 
  i personally thing there should be a quota for each country . 
  but , there should be calculated risk of accepting ` not compatible ' religions . 
  and for sure , countries should have time to prepare for such actions . 
  oh man , i was n't expecting to have such laugh out of this whole topic . 
  you meant lvl 67 ( retirement age in poland ), 
  almost got to the 67 level cap . 
  but i heard that end game is shit , so nothing lost . 
  hehe , good one . 
  some people did n't get it . 
  i heard that greece is going to increase their budget spending for 2017 . 
  a little bit too far buddy . 
  i do n't want to be part of those people . 
  they will be still in europe . 
  we still are all close culturally and economically . 
  what with all uk hate lately . 
  everybody cheers for their economically fallout . 
  they will be our partners . 
  they need to do well . 
  being out does n't mean they can not discuss it . 
  they will be still part of europe and they will be trading partner . 
  so either way , some eu decision will affect them as well . 
  you are a pole !, 
  polish death camps . 
  please use proper upper case lettering !, 
  let 's be civil . 
  you meant polish death camps . 
  poland should become new statistical definition for eu mediana . 
  `` belgium is 0.2 points above pm '', 
  why they care ? 
  are those women forced by men to wear it ? 
  how they define something is burkini and not new fashion fad ? 
  stalker and metro for me  next step , cossacks . 
  of course countries that fucked them the most will try to recuperate . 
  ok , i know it 's not exactly true  looks like less religion more acceptance . 
  small note , it 's from 2013 . 
  a lot changed in last 3 years . 
  it 's light in comparison to killing and segregating people . 
  but i agree that next step should be acceptance . 
  i personally do n't understand how someone can build opinion about someone else based on his sexuality . 
  only drive here in poland seems to be religion . 
  but again , generally people do n't seem to give a fuck . 
  media of course will tell you otherwise . 
  no worries . 
  do you plan to apply for grant ?
