  when i 'll get to my pc i will post more details . 
  but generally , current poland eu investment cycle is mostly targeted to move r&d in private sector . 
  whole plan is called `` smart growth '' . 
  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/cretu/announcements/eu-will-invest-eu86-billion-regional-funds-poland-boost-innovation_en they currently are dividing it into domain programs . 
  for example there is separate plan for textile and metallurgic industry . 
  they also assigned some ` small ' sum for game development . 
  those investment opportunities are mostly targeted at bigger research and development programs . 
  if you are interested in taking part . 
  * [ game dev ] ( http://www.ncbir.pl/fundusze-europejskie/poir/konkursy/konkurs3122016gameinn/ ) * there are separate plans for textile and metallurgic industry but i do n't have a link at hand . 
  nicely done description with pictures : https://www.kpmg.com/pl/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/documents/2015/european-union-funds-for-the-years-2014-2020-guide-for-investors.pdf it 's welcome change , to previous poir investment cycles which had strange limitations ( young age , young business , internet applications ) . 
  solid 6th place ... from a bottom !, 
  not even visible on full data set view . 
  i wonder how it will change after r&d investing that is going on now . 
   dude , podlaskie is good as it is . 
  amazing place . 
  i must admit i did n't actually visit 90 % of my own country . 
  need to fix that soon . 
  did n't know that . 
  you are right , 3500 russians built it and 15 of them died during a process . 
  i do n't know anything about warsaw planning . 
  but it looks like to me that land is divide among ` to big ' number of entities . 
  and there is no direction to preserve given panorama , as there is no point of interest other then `` palac kultury '' , which is building that many poles think should be destroyed . 
  they could though out some better strategy on how to balance things out . 
  but i think for many years , aesthetics were n't our main concern . 
  also , i 'm just glad we do n't have [ coca cola hamster wheel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_eye ) in a center of our city . 
  ( sorry , could n't resist , london is beautiful . 
  it 's like prague + new york ), 
  whether we like it or not , it was built using polish hands and it 's part of our history . 
  maybe instead of destroying it , use it to showcase positive ways of transforming poland . 
  i personally like it visually . 
  much more interesting then cold skyscrapers . 
  but i also understand why some people hate it , or use it for political reasons . 
  ** edit . 
  ** as pointed out by other redditor , 3 500 russians built it , and 15 of them died . 
  so it was n't built by poles . 
  random scrapper generator . 
  but at the end of a day , i prefer it to be ugly but prosperous . 
  please just spare few coins for eastern poland , 
  proximity to russia , inspires will to fight . 
  finland going strong with 74 . 
  we are most liberal country of them all . 
  my hussary feathers are erected . 
  i 'm not church enthusiast , but they did pretty good . 
  and i 'm super happy that nothing major happened . 
  i 'm even surprised how much i agree with pope assessment of our current political environment and immigration strategies . 
  politicians of course managed to fuck some things up but nothing new and major . 
  i just want to hear from them something along the lines : `` ok , we will try to do better '' . 
  but instead they picked up defensive position . 
  ctr + f , polish , poland , poles . 
  not found . 
  phew . 
  however , to early to tell . 
  [ i 'll go to hell for that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5d9brln5k4 ) but seriously , how is it possible and how is it allowed by international trade rules . 
  101 : how to get opposite effect to what you wanted . 
  if i was asked about our national flower i would go with daisies or snowdrops . 
  i envy you russia !, 
  [ lodz , kurwa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utlr5kabkpe ), 
  did n't catch it . 
  good point  but i do n't think klondikelover meant that . 
  afterwards he will pitch his saudi brothers to invest in eastern poland !, 
  and will correct each instances of `` polish death camps '' used by media and his friends . 
  smart . 
  better safe then sorry . 
  he should talk more about our polish pope : rydzyk . 
  and his modest kingdom . 
  they planned to introduce temporary alcohol prohibition . 
  luckily they did n't enforce it . 
  so [ `` there will be blood '' ] ( http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/m/mv5bmja0nje1odeynv5bml5banbnxkftztcwndizmze5nq@@._v1_sy1000_sx750_al_.jpg ) . 
  he is like monty python of isis . 
  isis killing us with laughter . 
  that is welcome news . 
  world youth days are coming in krakow . 
  wish us guys good luck . 
  [ polish billionaire , never heard of one ] ( https://youtu.be/1bck5wllj5s?t=893 ), 
  upcoming world youth days in krakow will probably look like dysfunctional family reunion . 
  if they charged some guy that was uploading movie for free . 
  but they caught a guy that was making 13 million dollars in advertising from this site . 
  now they will just ask him to give it back . 
  inverse piracy . 
  i will buy your hardware as soon someone will steal it from you . 
  he got around 13\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ from advertising . 
  he is aware that torrents are virus land mines , it 's safer bet to use itunes . 
  surprised , maybe the first time . 
  now we are just waiting . 
  [ it 's to damn peaceful !, 
  ] ( https://imgflip.com/s/meme/too-damn-high.jpg ), 
  trump is 1.88 , his son eric 1.96 . 
  good luck guys . 
  what happened to him in the last one ? 
  he looks intact , other then some pressure inflicted blood leakage . 
  30 mln , people . 
  i 'm expecting my white hood in post tomorrow . 
  our president and politicians could learn a lot from this guy . 
  it 's horrifying how people go with voice that matches flow of discussion . 
  thanks for sharing krrit data . 
  i hope he will adjust his message . 
  in addition 75 % of poles have access to internet : http://www.polskieradio.pl/42/273/artykul/1533636,gus-ponad-75-procent-polakow-ma-dostep-do-internetu, 
  `` invisible hand of the market has spoken '', 
  it 's tragic how bad this article is . 
  no mentions of 3 questions that were used to calculate ` knowledge levels ' .
