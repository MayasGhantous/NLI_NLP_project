  they calculated badly points for poland . 
  no clear link to source . 
  i was only able to catch errors thanks to [ thatfool ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qwxb7/after_the_uk_referendum_a_map_showing_how/d4wj8z4 ) edit : upon request they fixed calc . 
  and added 3 questions that were used for survey . 
  they made mistake when calculating poland . 
  65 +74 +57 = 65.33 , not 58.66 voxeurope has 0 knowledge about mathematics , which explains why actually gb exited eu / s ** edit : ** upon request they fixed calc . 
  and added 3 questions that were used for survey . 
  and they got poland wrong . 
  65 +74 +57 = 65.33 on their chart it 's 58.66 all in all it 's fucking manipulative to use this 3 questions as indicator of eu knowledge . 
  the only question that matters is second one about parliment . 
  instead of first and last one they should ask more about eu mission , single market and budgets . 
  then suddenly results would become more flat .

  i 'm reviewing source used for quantification of this data . 
  but i have not idea how they decided on those knowledge levels . 
  source for interested : http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/s2099_83_3_std83_eng/resource/b13759e8-9e26-4978-9f2b-12433bb284fb does anyone know how they calculated it ? 
  as source shows quite generic questions about how people ` feel ' about different eu topics . 
  [ well done ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vchreye5gzq ), 
  thanks . 
  this one is really clear and shows nicely how far we are from final results . 
   you should disabuse yourself of the idea that you decide what the country needs and does n't need . 
  points to you , i put it wrong . 
  i just agreed with him that it 's good he is not here . 
   secondly , you know nothing regarding his motivation to move . 
  for some immigrants , it 's not a choice . 
  based on his comment it was politically driven decision . 
  if it was n't , i do n't understand why he lied down that point in his comment :  good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit ... 
  but you are right , other then that i know nothing about his decision . 
  anyway i just reaffirmed his decision . 
   thirdly , making a comment on reddit does not add to any pile . 
  it hurts your feelings , sure , but that does not mean it 's making poland a shittier country . 
  here you did n't understood me . 
  we are talking about democracy . 
  in perfect case discussion should be productive . 
  saying that someone is happy ( good ) he/she does n't live here due to change of ruling party is just false . 
  they dumb down concept of a country to political slogans put in media . 
  and use all of that to reaffirm their decisions . 
  same goes to offending politicans and summarazing country vector as ` shit ' . 
  i 'm just tired of that kind of discussion . 
  which probably caused me being a little bit to harsh . 
  for that i 'm sorry . 
   all in all , your implication that he or she is a coward is the real shallow statement here . 
  more bitter than anything . 
  oh come one man . 
  where did i said he/sh is a coward ? 
  he/she probably left to provide better life for himself/family and i 'm all up for it . 
  nothing cowardly about that . 
  it requires a lot of energy and bravery to face new environment . 
  i just do n't like if people mix such decisions with politics and then compress whole thing to one :  good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit ... 
  where did i said he/she ca n't be critical ? 
  ba3d offended kaczynski , and said everything is `` going to shit '' . 
  such insightfully commentary . 
  democracy 3.0 . 
  v republic of poland . 
   good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit i just reaffirm him that we do n't need such people that on a whim decide to choose more comfortable life , and now are first to comment about how great decision they made . 
  he will be changing countries very often based on that . 
  sure , be critical , but i myself will be critical of shallow statements . 
  we are aware of how shitty pr we have currently . 
  does it mean i should just pack my things and leave ? 
  we are trying to fight it of as much as we can . 
  and if ba3d wa n'ts to help , he is welcome . 
  there will be a lot of shit to move . 
  but let 's just not add to a pile . 
   good thing i do n't actually live there i 'm glad you do n't live here as well . 
  and if you are so happy about it , focus on your new politicians . 
  i hope the ruling party in your new homeland will not change , ever . 
  i 'm not happy either about ruling party but poland is much more then politics . 
  at least to me . 
  whatever you decide , we will still love you the same . 
  that 's bad :( i though they maybe took into account working on weekends as modern slavery . 
  but based on description it looks like we have some things to fix : http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/country/poland/, 
  oh , i think this decision will be ultimate mecha-streisand effect . 
  looks like one off those visits from businesses to pitch about future work opportunities . 
  i must say that her choreography was a little bit flat . 
  she was probably sleeping on her stripping classes . 
  however , i 'll need to watch it from the beginning to make a full impression . 
  my favorite polish joke ( [ as a pole ] ( http://www.stargate4173.com/polar/polarjournals/images/pole406.jpg ) ) : q : how do you know if your in front of a polish firing squad ? 
  a : they are standing in a circle . 
  on more serious note , are we that badly perceived in usa ? 
  truer words were never truer, 
  it 's getting better . 
  negative attitude dropped from 47 to 35 in one year . 
  in the same period positive attitude did rise from 15 to 28 . 
  let just hope this trend will continue . 
  fucking is the easy part . 
  for anything else , visit any of our neighbors . 
  and due to that fear , shitload of polish people decided to go to uk . 
  living in low income areas around other migrants that are very `` different people '' . 
  seems like this fear is not as powerful as will to have more comfortable life . 
  so if you are right , it will be quite easy to get rid off . 
  looking at krakow , wroclaw , poznan and warsaw , you can already see huge move toward mixed nation . 
  people will slowly get more comfortable with seeing polish + families . 
  we need that . 
  even from biological point of view . 
  we can not fuck each other till ethernity , otherwise whole `` polish bloodline '' will get weaker . 
  maybe that point will force hardcore nationalists to start embracing other cultures/nations , 
   opposing immigration plan seems to be basically fear of different people . 
  it 's not only that . 
  sure , there are groups that want to keep country ` clean ' .
