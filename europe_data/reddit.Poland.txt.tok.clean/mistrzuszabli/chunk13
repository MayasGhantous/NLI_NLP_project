  but they are minority . 
  majority of a country fears of terrorist attacks , ghettos , and aggression . 
  in addition , poland has many issues to resolve , so it seems strange to add one more problem to the list . 
  again , it 's not my personal opinion . 
  just an observation . 
  i think we need to be precise if we want to discuses such issues . 
  simplification in such matters will hurt and anger a lot of people . 
  and going back to hungary and current affairs . 
  i think we are simplifying , instead of trying to understand the problem . 
  i would love to hear more about orban issue with eu and ten year plan for hungary . 
  would he prefer to drop out of eu ? 
  or does he envision it differently ? 
  too soon . 
  no worries , [ it will be funny . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npob3dlb7wa ), 
  what it is it ? 
  populism , nationalism ? 
  i personally do n't agree with polish government . 
  there is shitload of ` posing ' to look strong . 
  however , it 's politics as always . 
  you should fight against it by providing counter points . 
  not by using same old statements like usa did with trump ( populist , racist , nationalist ) . 
  or as you did : ` hey , we gave you money so ... shut the fuck up ! ' . 
  however i 'm open to hearing your opinion about why some countries are opposing dublin plan for immigration issue and further expansion of eu power ( federation ) . 
  i 'm personally for it . 
  however , i understand people that want to stay separate and only use eu as open market . 
  question is , can it stay as such for a longer time , when we are becoming more and more codependent . 
  i do n't know . 
  feel free to calculate how much you gave in taxes to eu . 
  i 'll be happy to give you back your contribution . 
  tldr : it 's not that much . 
  this is not how you discuss such issues . 
  every country have right to be critical of eu . 
  of course to some extend . 
  saying ` let 's get the fuck out of eu ' using eu budget money directed for other things it 's indeed bulshit . 
  but i do n't think it 's what happening in hungary . 
  if some country has other vision for eu the what we currently have , it 's not exactly betrayal . 
  it 's how all partisan political systems work . 
  being critical of eu is fine . 
  if people will try to block voicing eu criticism , it will have opposite effect and will feed entities that want eu to dismantle . 
  core idea of taxation is you pay for shit you do n't always need personally or want . 
  it 's part of a general plan to move forward . 
  we are with you guys !, 
  stay strong !, 
  it 's just lovely . 
  i can feel history on my faces just by watching this picture . 
  yeah , no , maybe . 
  my professional assessment . 
  you can have mine !, 
  he could just say that everybody should be paid based on their experience and skill . 
  but he loves attention . 
  oh , orange as a color . 
  what 's next , burning [ pantone color books and samples ] ( https://www.amazon.com/pantone-colors/dp/1419701800 ) ? 
  is there some symbolism behind it ? 
  did fascist loved oranges ? 
  at least we are seen as colleagues . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe next-gen will bring friendship in us . 
  but by the looks of it , shortest path to the romanian heart is work and stability . 
  we share a lot !, 
  we are [ christ of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe )  wink wink .

  would love to see women without makeup and air brushing . 
  based on official nato data it 's not : http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf, 
  true that . 
  i visited achill island once and was disappointed to have sunny weather and beaches in addition to old buildings .

  i wanted to say that we probably use russians engines , but i checked and it seams that vulcain 2 is used in ariane 5 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ariane_5 i think we could at least compare cost of sending stuff to our orbit . 
  anyhow i 'm positively surprised we use our own engines . 
  i agree with others that spending should be adjusted for cost of investments . 
  i assume it 's much lower in russia . 
  so best way would be to compare similar projects and costs of them in eu and russia . 
  this exchange reminds me of [ sarcastaball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmaha7kjvu ),

  we done pegging !, 
  you forgot to invest in reddit etiquette education !, 
  someone did n't forgot to invest in eastern poland . 
  damn , that 's one fucking nice lake !, 
  honest good luck . 
  i know eu want 's to make example out of united kingdom , but we gain nothing if they fail . 
  either way we need strong ties with uk , and fruitful commerce . 
  i will never understand why people can hate so much on people loving each other . 
  i hope progressively we will see more support for gays in poland . 
  could be hard with current gov , but will see . 
  this is nuts2 !, 
  i assume , darker means better ?

  damn , i would play shitload of strategy game on huge scale with such amount of detail !,
