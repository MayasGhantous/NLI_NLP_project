  so what should we do ? 
  just call it quits ? 
  pick every instance of vandalism and glorify it to a levels of hate for whole nation ? 
  it 's not worth it . 
  we should focus on building up our relationship . 
  sure , there are some bumps . 
  but there is also huge potential for amazing economical and cultural relationship . 
  i just hope that both our and theirs gov will fight for it . 
  however i agree that there are some political issues to resolve on historical backgrounds . 
  we should n't just avoid that . 
  it should be part of conversation . 
  but i do n't believe it 's something that should just cause rejection of whole ukrainian nation . 
  first thing i thought that it 's provocation . 
  either way , i 'll not be manipulated by some extremists . 
  they will not divide us !, 
   causalities : heavy ( 11 teutonic knights including hanus and thomas surville ) it seems like we lost 11 ` tanks ' . 
  i wonder if it 's 11 tanks + 500 regular infantry . 
  or do they literally mean that 11 people died as heavy causalities ? 
   invasion : an occasion when an army or country uses force to enter and take control of another country : http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/invasion, 
  [ invaders must die !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-sgc37xhe ) what 's the difference between fought with and invade ? 
   invasion : an occasion when an army or country uses force to enter and take control of another country http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/invasion on the other hand . 
  yes , we were often aggressors . 
  we did n't win enough to be proper invaders . 
  so in the end we were banned from eu for few years  oh you guys . 
  polanie mmm , first one of course . 
  would milk cows again . 
  i doubt that husbands of wives that complained about the issue where there . 
  they also tried to burn house/flat of algerian . 
  where are french men supporting their women ? 
  seems like huge lack of solidarity or understanding . 
  my only explanation would be fear of confrontation . 
  also , it seems like all of those cafes etc. 
  are run by muslims . 
  is this whole area taken over by muslim business . 
  if so , they are very resourceful . 
   i could see from the corners of my eyes so many poles eyeballing us . 
  `` spoiled western europeans '' mutters everywhere . 
  did you drink in church ? 
   otherwise it could be envy mixed with approval . 
  i hope you mean you licensed it to china . 
  i loved and still love those background , created from botanical like sketches of plants . 
  true . 
  however from our point of view you are doing better then us  but people like to compensate either way . 
  if we fail in all fronts , there is always ww ii , partitions and deluge to fall into . 
  however i must admit that we are a little bit [ disappointed ] ( https://youtu.be/_o1hm-k3auy?t=11 ) in you . 
  where is krtek ? 
  it 's big part of my childhood and no new productions ? 
  shame . 
  true , reddit is quite good at validating stuff , but it takes time and effort to read pass headlines . 
  watched your link . 
  damn , that was bad . 
   `` you are so cute '' however i still would like to see rt materials , and judge them by myself . 
  as i do with cnn and others . 
  why rt is banned and cnn is not ? 
  oh you guys  you missed us . 
  [ happy new year to you too !,

  difference is in who will be managing it and from business point of view it will count as an asset when banks value given entity . 
  now they can more easily introduce budget to promote it and make it more visible for tourists . 
  they can use it as transaction item when museums temporarily borrow their assets . 
  sure , ideally it should be given out as donation . 
  in the end i 'm not knowledgeable enough to asses this deal . 
  $ 100m euro for $ 2bn asset seems like ok deal . 
  it 's also like 0.12 % of our yearly budget . 
  this is stupid and dangerous . 
  if political climate changes , this will be great tool to filter out ` true in our opinion ' news . 
  focus on educating people goddammit !, 
  also this news seems like fake one as well . 
   what if my mom is hundred other people . 
  for sure she is  we all are a product of huge gang bang . 
  a little bit spread out , but still at least hundred people fucked to produce your , mine and many more mothers . 
  however , this number may be lower if you believe that world is 2016 years old .

  where is my fucking snow !, 
  what does domain check proof ? 
  they have their origin on their website . 
  did you missed one big `` in ukraine '' in their logo ? 
  : http://khpg.org/skin/logo_en.png however reddit history is a little suspicious . 
  seems like automatic article spam to all possible related channels . 
  either pr or propaganda , or both . 
  i also do not recommend calling people retarded . 
  i really feel sorry for france . 
  i wonder who gave usa statue of liberty and for what . 
  thanks , included it in my post . 
  where is source to this reports ? 
  ibt does n't seem like a frontline of quality journalism . 
  why is lately so popular to post articles with some hard statements that does n't contain any sources/references . 
  even in my school years i was required to prepare list of sources for my projects . 
  seems like journalism these days does n't follow same quality requirements as high school paper work assignment . 
  however , on the other side 90 % of a page is covered in ads ... edit : source provided in children comment :  [ the source is the french newspaper `` le canard enchain\u00e9 '' ] ( http://www.lecanardenchaine.fr/la-une-du-21-decembre-2016/ ) , it is n't online , only their frontpage is . 
  it 's a newspaper on subscription , ad free . 
  it 's a serious journalism independant source , well known for their investigations . 
  thanks @cintronbleu . 
  now it would be nice if someone could translate it  or maybe img -  txt -  translator will do it 's work , will try later . 
  sorry , i was n't clear enough . 
  2.9 % was like worst case scenario estimated by polish economists/traders for third quarter this year . 
  thanks for source !, 
  it 's pretty detailed , will have a read . 
  there is a lot of miss information in this article .
