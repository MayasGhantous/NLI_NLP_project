  will see . 
  it would n't be polexit , it would poltard . 
  is / r/yurop leaking ? 
  is whole tvp like that or just tvp info ? 
  this is unwatchable :( i was just waiting for her personal story , where she was kicked out from lidl because she thing 's germany needs to pay for it . 
  i do n't care , as long they do it in silence and with respect ( i hope they did , only saw a photo ) . 
  yeap , and i love how it 's get upvoted , and heavily discussed , even without slice of source or even direct quote from article title . 
  what the fuck is this website . 
  promo on their website : http://superstore.wnd.com/the-big-lie-exposing-the-nazi-roots-of-the-american-left-hardcover this is book version of clickbait link . 
  whenever i see uk favorable post on reddit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhku4znvo8 but honestly , good for you !, 
  `` not only my gdp grew 3.6 % '', 
  but germany can into czechia , 
  for a second i though it was federal ban , and got worried . 
  but it 's one shitty gym . 
  that actually positive . 
  i would love to see support across time . 
  we could estimate when it would hit critical points . 
  or , she will forever love him from comfort of his basement . 
  the end . 
  yes , it 's hard one , as no gov. 
  loves to hear from external judiciary system how it should look like . 
  but our constitution says that we should follow and respect treaties that we sign , so here we are . 
  i 'm pretty sure that they will provide required amendments , as they seem quite reasonable . 
  it 's not worth the further fight . 
  however , they will perform huge show for sovereignty . 
  embrace . 
  yes , however they key issue seems to be relatively small and something that our gov. 
  actually can agree on :  the commission 's key legal concern identified in the law on the organisation of ordinary courts relates to the discrimination on the basis of gender due to the introduction of a different retirement age for female judges ( 60 years ) and male judges ( 65 years ) . 
  this is contrary to article 157 treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) and directive 2006/54 on gender equality in employment . 
  they actually picked least controversial parts . 
  so if they decided to make retirement age equal , at least at levels where minister of justice will decide if they can keep on working , key issue will be resolved . 
  second part is related , as minister of justice decides what to do with judges after they hit retirement age . 
  again , seems like reasonable demand . 
  however , i do n't understand why they did n't pick on the fact that minister of justice will pick chairman 's of common courts . 
  seems like much bigger issue , and one that our ruling party would defend much harder . 
  if our government will shit on those proposals/comments , we fully deserve article 7 , and lack of veto from hungary . 
  yes , that 's why i 'm saying that it just standard proceeding : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/avs/files/video6/repository/prod/photo/store/2/p035062000102-642963.jpg each infringement can end up in article 7 being invoked . 
  current state of affairs :  next steps : the commission 's letter of formal notice requests the polish government to reply within one month . 
  after examining poland 's reply , or if no observations have been submitted within the prescribed time-limit , the commission may issue a reasoned opinion , the second stage of the infringement procedure . 
  so currently we are at initial stage . 
  so in my opinion it 's at the same level as those other infringements . 
  especially considering what they are asking about ( key issue : equal retirement age for both sexes ) . 
  so that 's why i think people are just over reacting . 
  i kind of ok with with , because our gov. 
  needs to be checked . 
  but i would also prefer if people would n't cheer for article 7 or scaremongering . 
  source -- http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-2205_en.htm, 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-2205_en.htm  the commission 's key legal concern identified in the law on the organisation of ordinary courts relates to the discrimination on the basis of gender due to the introduction of a different retirement age for female judges ( 60 years ) and male judges ( 65 years ) . 
  that should n't be hard to fix . 
  it looks like they just used our current gender split used for retirement . 
  the second concern is a little bigger one , but it 's not key one . 
  seems strange . 
  article 258 --  if the commission considers that a member state has failed to fulfil an obligation under the treaties , it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the state concerned the opportunity to submit its observations . 
  if the state concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the commission , the latter may bring the matter before the court of justice of the european union . 
  it 's exactly what 's happening atm . 
  they gave us one month to respond and i assume show the road to implementing corrections . 
  if we fail , then it will enter next stage , with their ` response ' . 
  and afterwards comes ** article 7 ** . 
  however my assumption seems to be contradicted by what i found here : https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/infringements/general-information_en seems like the worst case scenario for 258 is ** penalty payment ** . 
  so you maybe right . 
  hehe , yeah . 
  there seems to be few * justice , fundamental rights and citizenship * . 
  but it 's regarding money laundering and terrorism . 
  so less important then making sure that retirement age of judges is equal for both sexes . 
  why they did n't pick up on minister of justice selecting chairman 's . 
  i 've no idea . 
  maybe it 's there but was n't quoted in dw article ? 
  ok , i 've reached my time limit for politics this weekend . 
  there are shitload of other infringements . 
  why everybody is so loud about this one ? 
  people are rooting for article 7 to pass etc. 
  looking at the amount of pending infringements , shitload of countries are at risk . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-law/infringements-proceedings/infringement_decisions/index.cfm?lang_code=en&amp;r_dossier=&amp;noncom=0&amp;decision_date_from=&amp;decision_date_to=&amp;active_only=0&amp;title=&amp;submit=search edit -- i agree with their decision . 
  however , the points raised are quite minor and easy to fix . 
  edit 2 . 
  -- http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-2205_en.htm why they are calling it infringement ? 
  it seems to follow different proceeding . 
  following framework shows two options for approaching rule of law issues . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/avs/files/video6/repository/prod/photo/store/2/p035062000102-642963.jpg does it mean we are on the left or right side ? 
  i would assume it 's right , as left can not end up in article 7 . 
  so yeah , it looks like a big deal . 
  or maybe left side just means that given infringement is recorded . 
  by the looks of it , infringement have two levels . 
  ones that require communication with member state ( important issues ) . 
  and ones that are resolved immediately through monetary penalty . 
  edit 3 . 
  -- i 've reviewed excel with all infringements from 2016 , 2017 . 
  our 's seems like heavy one . 
  no other memo includes article 7 as a risk . 
   `` the new rules allow the minister of justice to exert influence on individual ordinary judges through , in particular , the vague criteria for the prolongation of their mandates , thereby undermining the principle of irremovability of judges , '' the commission said in a statement . 
   it also took issue with the introduction of different retirement ages for female and male judges , set at 60 and 65 years , respectively . 
  seems like easy fix . 
  i 'm surprised they were n't picky about minister of justice picking chairman 's . 
  still , they could wait  but sadly , they are correct . 
  one that passed through cracks broke eu article more then krs one with adjustments . 
  could n't they fucking wait till monday ? 
  it does n't matter if he is right . 
  it matters that he called polish-american alliance worth nothing . 
  that 's a strong statement and he should n't said that as gov. 
  official .
