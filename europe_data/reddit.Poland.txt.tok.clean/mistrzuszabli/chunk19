  is it due to economical issues and lack of better ways to dispose of them ? 
  or just pure carelessness in that regard ? 
  not sure why you got downvoted . 
  here you go : leaveu@gazetapolska.pl and in case it will land in spam , try this one : sorosfault@gazetapolska.pl fingers crossed !,

  nailed to a cross !, 
  a cross from where ? 
  good friday, 
  i think in this context he is laughing at germans . 
  if we are still talking about refugees . 
  that 's one nice fucking castle right there !, 
  [ mmmh ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/622_350/5771ff5b1800002500fa2c00.jpeg?cache=pqd9baqeys ) but ... you probably meant germans attitude towards jewish community . 
  yes , it 's literally the same . 
  `` gazeta polska '' is at low end of popularity , sales wise . 
  despite trying to be very controversial . 
  looking at your quick judgment , seems like you could easily find work there . 
  sadly , yes . 
  he will always be a victim by default . 
  soros looks too friendly in this one . 
  here ya go : http://www.patriotinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/georgesoros-evilreincarnate-385x380.png, 
  mirinda is quite popular here in poland . 
  was n't aware it 's from spain . 
  it 's veeeeeeeeeeery sweet . 
  `` 12 years a czech '', 
  i would n't throw him out of my bed . 
  but he might . 
  polish population size of finland was killed . 
  it 's what poland did in 1939 . 
  sorry , i mostly meant nato members . 
  as long as nato will not change their engagement rules . 
  also , i meant going to war without provocation . 
  of course , if they decide to annex some city or region , that 's a viable option . 
  however , if finland would fight alone , it would be mostly honorary defense . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_finnish_army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_russian_ground_forces#tanks but i think , other countries would come for help . 
  it 's quite sad thing regarding ukraine . 
  there were kind of betrayed by eu . 
  first giving incentive to join , and then we left them hanging . 
  however , as i said ... nobody want 's to go to war with russia . 
  it 's not even about winning . 
  countries that are direct neighbors or have significant russian minority could have rightful reason to be afraid of `` russian tourism '' . 
  i do n't think people are talking about `` invasion '' and `` war war '' . 
  the more worrying thing is this proxy shit going on everywhere nowadays . 
  russia do n't need to invade anybody . 
  their freedom fighters at given country borders are enough . 
  same goes for cyber-war , influencing elections etc. 
  sorry , but in that regard , you are just wrong . 
  due to crimea and current situation in ukraine , proxy border conflict and annexation is a valid concern . 
   ... though the sanctions have so far not lowered putin 's popularity . 
  maybe , because of ` investments ' like nord stream 2 ? 
  i find currently we 're possibly destabilizing the situation . 
  could it be that we started it with ukraine and quite strong invitation and support for them joining eu ? 
   and what is the threat here is that if you construct such a narrative ( where russia is the big bad wolf ) over years and years , eventually people start to believe it and are more willing to go to war with russia . 
  i agree and i 'm worried about it as well . 
  i see shitload of blind hate and misinformation towards russia nowadays . 
  but still , it does n't mean we ca n't be against what they are doing . 
  however , we for sure , should be more precise . 
  also . 
  come one . 
  nobody is willing to go to war with russia !, 
  we are worried about cyber-war , affecting elections , annexation , proxy border conflicts , `` russian tourism '' . 
  we just do n't want ` more russia ' then we can take . 
  and i believe it 's a valid concern nowadays . 
   i think you misunderstood me there , i was not commenting about the sanctions , i only wanted europe to go it 's own path in the future . 
  ok . what did you meant by * `` to go it 's own path '' * ? 
  did you meant to strongly decide to either just block any economical connections with russia or do n't at all ? 
  open to hearing more on that topic . 
  http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/317840,russian-upper-house-wants-sanctions-against-poland-for-%e2%80%98decommunisation%e2%80%99-laws i just hope ` sanctions ' in russian does n't mean expanding on polish tourism with twenty five t-16 . 
  me love me some t-16 , but i prefer to admire them from comfort of my chair . 
  no worries . 
  we would introduce sanctions on russian dolls !, 
  in addition , new air stream 3 would gas everybody . 
  sorry , i mea n't gas for everybody !, 
   we 're not winning anything by portraying russia as the big evil wolf and america as the good guys . 
  who does that ? 
  especially lately . 
  both parties had not so great pr lately . 
   the only right path ... 
  die only right path . 
  oh germany  let 's talk sanctions . 
  -- https://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu-sanctions-against-russia-over-ukraine-crisis_en how is nord stream 2 not breaking this :  eu nationals and companies may also not provide loans with a maturity exceeding 30 days to the entities described above . 
  is it all due to shell companies doing business , instead of russian ones directly ? 
  or is it due to lack of connection to :  * five major state-owned russian banks ;  * three major russian energy companies ;  * three major russian defence companies ;  * subsidiaries outside the eu of the entities above , and those acting on their behalf or at their direction . 
  if you avoid connection with three major russian energy companies and banks when working on nord stream 2 . 
  you have one creative lawyers and accountants . 
  is it only possible because nord stream 2 was already paid fully and there are not new transactions ? 
  or is it just because those are not loans , just free cash exchange ? 
  how loans are wrong but pushing money for free there is all right ? 
  do you think it 's ` fair ' ? 
  us side effect sanctions on germany due to nord stream 2 -- what do you think about it ? 
  is it wrong ? 
  i think it 's * `` the only right path '' * . 
  do n't see it as punishment . 
  it 's just a tax . 
  my opinion -- i have nothing against russian people . 
  i do n't see russian as intrinsically evil . 
  but i still believe that nord stream 2 is hurting inner eu and usa relations . 
  now the question is , what 's more important . 
   i 'm a proponent of debt being a last resort , not something you should perpetuate or keep for the next party to deal with . 
  i fully agree . 
  sadly that 's how system works nowadays .
