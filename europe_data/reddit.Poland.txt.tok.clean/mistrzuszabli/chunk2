  however i was n't been in uk after a brexit vote yet . 
  so there is still a chance . 
  or do you mean every ukrainian from reddit has story of being verbally abused in poland ? 
  that would make me sad :(, 
  i just imagine junkers putting the clash on speakers during negotations : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn1wwnedwam, 
  i know it 's opinion piece and they are meant to stir conversation . 
  so here i go . 
  how are we anti immigration ? 
  last numbers prove otherwise . 
  ardently nationalist ?!, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  does he mean social nationalist like hitler , or just nationalist in a way of keeping given country identity , which i think all eu members are for . 
  sure , our ruling party changed , happens to every country in the world . 
  we need to be prepared for that . 
  however people do n't change that easily . 
  year ago , media were silent about poland . 
  nowadays , everybody has some opinion about what polish population is like . 
  and sadly , mostly everybody is wrong with their estimates . 
  if the same accuracy is used in portraying russians , i fell really sorry for them . 
  same goes for britain lately . 
  but in the end , those are opinion pieces , as it 's mine . 
  and people should think twice before taking them seriously . 
  few months ago you would 've more upvotes  bad timing . 
  you forgot about mexico !, 
  however in our hearts they are already part of eu . 
  canada has same per capita gdp as uk . 
  overall their gdp is $ 1.462 trillion vs uk $ 2.65 trillion . 
  not bad for a country of 33 million people ( half of uk population ) . 
  it 's for sure far from full replacement , but should smooth things up a little bit . 
  so if i understand correctly , now polish companies can take part in canada public contract negotiations/auctions . 
  it 's seems a little bit unfair as it 's quite cheaper to hire developer here ( for now ) . 
  can polish company sue canada if one of those public contract auctions will reject polish company despite it being best contender ? 
  did n't find anything specific . 
  have a go yourself : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/ on a right side there is latest news sidebar . 
  it 's not like we wanted to be like that . 
  it did n't make sense to move to a country with low wages , and at some point low number of people speaking english . 
  now it changes pretty fast . 
  we are slowly regaining our identity . 
  and i 'm not talking about how we suffered and who fucked us . 
  i 'm talking about focusing on our culture , folklore , music , movies , games . 
  witcher is helping a lot to push thing forwards . 
  maybe movies will come along after huge success of witcher movie ( i hope ) . 
  we have a lot of folklore stories , landscapes , music to share . 
  i would like us to modernize and push it !, 
  i believe we will reach that point someday . 
  i 'm personally already seeing my country as such . 
  and i hope soon others will too , including some future polish people from asia , africa , and both americas . 
  you meant to say : `` you are close enough '' , 
  if anyone is interested , they made content of agreement public : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154329.pdf 1.5 k pages . 
  ** chapter 8 ** is about investment and creation of new court system that will resolve claims between corporations and countries ( and probably corp vs corp ) for people looking for quick read , this is quite good q&a : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/questions-and-answers/ i recommend part about investment dispute settlement system ( eu + canada version of isds ) . 
  there also seems to be a body created for lobbying corporate interest whenever new legislature is in works . 
  after outcry they decided to not go with isds . 
  they will create idss ( investment dispute settlement system )  which will be created from members of all participating governments . 
  more info here : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/questions-and-answers/ so , it the end it looks like all that bitching was for something . 
  do n't forget that initially it was intended to be passed in `` silence '' . 
  tpp and ttip showed that transparency is still lacking and allowed to put more focus on ceta . 
  court is still there but they changed who will be part of it . 
  i 'm not against it , i 'm just surprised how rhetoric changed after brexit . 
  also did you saw final version of aggrement ? 
  if you interested : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154329.pdf chapter 8 is about investment and new tribunal that will resolve all corp vs gov claims . 
  short q&a summarizing most important parts of ceta : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/questions-and-answers/, 
  i wanted to find some cases against your point but actually found one for it  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_morris_v._uruguay uruguay won $ 7 mln against tobacco company . 
  however it still feels a little strange to see companies suing countries , over legislatures that are good for public . 
  in case of eu , we may feel a little bit safer then each country by itself . 
  but still . 
  did n't we all hated it due to giving corporation rights to sue state members ? 
  or did they drop this part from final deal ? 
  or are we just going with it because of brexit , and need for new girlfriend ? 
  ** edit ** they did n't drop it . 
  two most important things in new wersion : * creation of investment dispute settlement system ( tribunal ) . 
  resolving claims corp vs gov , corp vs corp. * investment protection group . 
  allows for lobbying on behalf of corp , whenever new legislation is in works .

  nah , we are building nuclear male chastity for putin ( key chain sold separately ) .

  we like russians , we are not in love with russian gov. 
  greek move . 
  fiii ... nineteen percent income tax . 
  eh , i just ca n't . 
  but believe me , i tried . 
  i can repeat thirty five , that 's as close to five as i can get . 
  ~ ~ this is quite old data . 
  current average wage in poland is around 1000 euro . ~ ~ stupid me , map shows net income . 
  700 is correct then . 
  developers and other it professions pay actually more in ukraine , as they have lower taxes and they are paid in dollars . 
  also a lot of young couples came here because of army draft . 
  and others were forced as jobs moved to poland from ukraine and russia . 
  but i 'm not sure if it 's just minority of cases or majority . 
  only my personal experience . 
  in my experience a lot of them learn polish pretty quickly . 
  at least one having polish lessons . 
  i worked with ukrainians and russians in poland . 
  some of them had some sad stories about being verbally abused . 
  luckily nothing physical . 
  from my point of view , i begin to think we will hit some critical mass as a lot of ukrainian women decide to come here as well . 
  to much beauty . 
  maybe due to exposure , owner will find few `` angel '' investors to put up money to restore it . 
  [ that 's one fucking nice building right there ] ( https://youtu.be/wososxjn8lm?t=26 ) , at least from the outside .
