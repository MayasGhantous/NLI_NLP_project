  ok , i was talking about year to year deficit/debt as budgetary plan in correlation to gdp . 
  let 's talk government debt -- source -- https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/government-debt chart -- [ chart showcasing how debt rose during majority of po ruling ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gc1tr ) summary -- you can see that po did increase dept ** 75 % ** between 2007-2013 . 
  they almost doubled it !, 
  you can also notice that between 2009 - 2011 , debt rose about 200,000 millions ( but to be honest , that 's after 2008 economy crisis ) . 
  looking at pis , they seems to follow , po trend , with slow down coming now in 2017 ( january - june period have budget surplus ) . 
  i 'm not trying to defend pis , but there is shitload of biased information . 
  please forget about partisanship and focus on numbers . 
  anyhow , i agree , that increasing debt is not a good thing . 
  however , percentage wise , we are doing good in relation to gdp ( 2.4 % ) , but it would currently take 3 years of not spending anything to pa-yup our debt . 
  that 's not good . 
  if we worry about eu , currently we need to ensure that our deficit / gdp is in order : https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/government-budget and currently it is . 
  you can see that in worst periods , po introduced -7.3 deficit ( you can see correlation with huge increase in debt between 2009-2011 ) . 
  however , to be fair . 
  this is also result of 2008 economy crisis . 
  they managed to continuously decrease it to eu suggested levels ( 3 % ) . 
  which is good . 
  pis seems to decrease our year to year budgetary deficit / gdp as well . 
  however , our gdp growth was slower in comparison to 2015 , which also affects better deficit/gdp numbers . 
  so , one may argue , should n't pis take advantage of quite good standing of world economy and decrease debt further . 
  they , could , but that was n't their ` agenda ' . 
  they were elected on quite heavy social projects . 
  and to be honest , i 'm surprised they followed with it and managed to keep debt growth manageable . 
  what are their plans for reforming judiciary branch ? 
  as for 500 + -- deficit in 2016 end up being 15 % smaller then planned . 
  and it was in general smaller then one from 2015 . 
  [ euro stat : deficity ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7997684/2-24042017-ap-en.pdf/d83f50f3-ecab-457a-a46b-f58d3e42a030 ) however i 'm not sure what kind of data they use , as official deficit from 2016 was 4 mld bigger then one from 2015 . 
  but still , our deficit as percentage of gdp felt 0.2 % and it was smallest value at least till 2013 . 
  sure , there are other factors , like our gdp which did n't perform as well . 
  our bonds and investment also felt short . 
  but that 's different topic that i 'm happy to discuss it if you want , but it should n't be connected with 500 + . 
  also , here is current execution of 2017 budget . 
  -- we are past first half of the year and we have 5 mld ** suprlus ** !, 
  [ january-june 2016 ] ( http://www.mf.gov.pl/documents/764034/5220044/20160721_szacunek_vi_2016.pdf ) and all of this with 500 + and `` mieszkania + '' ( housing + ) . 
  sure , one may argue that without it we would have surplus in 2016 . 
  but , that 's a topic of economical preference . 
  we got pis , they are pro social expenditure . 
  they did it and at the same they did n't destroy our economy in short run . 
  will it work in a long run , i 've no idea . 
  did we need those social benefits ? 
  i personally believe so . 
  do i agree with most of pis ideas , no . 
  but even as part of pis opposition , i must say they did good , and are doing good in 2017 ( budgetary wise ) . 
  we do n't have [ in god we trust ] ( http://www.wnd.com/files/2016/03/in-god-we-trust-motto.jpg ) on our money . 
  we don ' have god in our anthem , nor we have christ in our constitution . 
   article 13 political parties and other organizations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of nazism , fascism and communism , as well as those whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred , the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the state policy , or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership , shall be prohibited . 
   article 33 men and women shall have equal rights in family , political , social and economic life in the republic of poland . 
  men and women shall have equal rights , in particular , regarding education , employment and promotion , and shall have the right to equal compensation for work of similar value , to social security , to hold offices , and to receive public honours and decorations . 
  so much moslems . 
   article 48 parents shall have the right to rear their children in accordance with their own convictions . 
  such upbringing shall respect the degree of maturity of a child as well as his freedom of conscience and belief and also his convictions . 
  limitation or deprivation of parental rights may be effected only in the instances specified by statute and only on the basis of a final court judgment . 
  so much oppression . 
  yes , and still people mention it separately when discussing latest changes in supreme court in poland . 
  and yes , they were . 
  kind of . 
   kaczynski could fucking end world hunger and the opposition would protest . 
  hehe , yeah . 
  that 's a problem that goes both ways . 
  they just fucking , literally , hate each other . 
  it 's not even politics as always anymore . 
  it 's mostly due to smolensk . 
  pis and po need to go . 
  or reorganize somehow . 
  there can not be a case when we discuss legislature changes and leader of ruling party looses his nerves and calls oppositions traitors and killers of his brother . 
  it did significantly lowered amount of children living in extreme poverty . 
  also birthrate is on the rise . 
  in addition such ` allowance ' is quite common in other eu countries like germany : http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/kindergeld.html however i fully agree on division . 
  they have potential to normalize , but they do n't take any chances . 
  oppositions is literally ` traitors ' to them and ` killers ' . 
  that 's quite heavy thing to say to your countrymen . 
  it seems that their hate of opposition takes precedence over what 's good for a country . 
  however , another issue is , that our current oppositions is incompetent and lazy . 
  they have no plan other then scream slogans and cry about end of democracy . 
  i personally am for 99 % of this bill . 
  however i 'm fully against initial purge of all judges and how much power minister of justice has in deciding who stays . 
  so , what can i do ? 
  everybody is either fully against this bill or for it . 
  safest road would be veto from president , and request to amend article about initial purge . 
  more prolonged one , would be legislative initiative from president to amend it in separate bill . 
  but we do n't have enough time i think to pass it before supreme court bill will take effect . 
  so , i 'm split . 
  i 'm not pis voter , nor i 'll be ( due to their religiousness , and approach to social issues like abortion , and equal marriage laws ) . 
  but they are in power now , so i try to focus on given issues and legislatures instead and just forget about ruling party itself . 
  as for my colleges , it 's 50/50 . 
  i must admit that a lot of people changed their mind regarding pis ( from hate to acceptance ) . 
  especially ones that have children and plan to have them . 
  and it 's not mostly about +500 , but safety ( immigration quota policy , retirement age , social safety net ) . 
  what also solidified pis approval , is quite good first year , budgetary wise . 
  so , in short , everybody is just looking into near future , and does n't take into account what will happen in 10 years . 
  but i do n't think that most voters in other countries do that ( looking at usa , uk ) . 
  hehe here we go , turkey . 
  now i need to count till someone mentions nsdap and nazi germany . 
  sadly , no . 
  i also disagree with that part fully . 
  however you need to remember that 's only one time purge of judges . 
  after that , sn judges can only by dismissed after they hit 70/75 years of age , or they break the law . 
  minister of justice or parliament have no power to dismiss them after initial purge . 
  so , if we can try focusing on fighting against this initial purge , i would be quite content . 
  as it would result in nice balance between oversight and independence . 
  even more so than what germany has .
