  but remember , we are quite young democracy , so it could be treated as jailbait .

  regarding 3/5 ? 
  he said in official statement he will not sign second bill if they will not introduce 3/5 majority . 
  however , i would prefer if he just vetoed all of them and require corrections . 
  as idea of judiciary reform is needed , but with what current ruling party presented is just ` show of power ' . 
  2/3 majority would be my suggestion . 
  and no picking of supreme court chairman 's by minister of justice , which i think was already dropped yesterday . 
  $ 9 bln net in 2015 . 
  we pay $ 4 bln back to eu a year , and this value is rising with our gdp and amount of vat transactions . 
  it 's biggest contribution to eu from cee countries . 
  mostly due to our population size , but still . 
  and just wait till we start inviting more ukrainians and maybe russians  we will brute force our way into your budgetary hearts . 
  input -- * our yearly budget is around $ 70.1 bln . 
  * development funds for 6 years ( 2014-20 ) : $ 67.81 bln * our eu revenue ( 2015 projected over 6 years ) : $ 22.30 bln . 
  net calculation results -- * net fund over 6 years : $ 45,51 * net fund over 1 year : $ 7,585 * percent of yearly budget : 10.82 % summary -- is 10.82 % budget investment enough to use it as an political tool ? 
  and this is worst case scenario , assuming gdp will not rise .

  this laws will not pass in current form !, 
  and not specifically due to eu influence ( but it will be sold as such ) . 
  our president is currently against specific parts , that would allow for ruling party to pick judges by them self . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what 's his view on giving our minister of justice power to select supreme court chairman 's . 
  but will see . 
  germany , spain ? 
  however they require 2/3 ( lower + upper house ) and additional input from judges . 
  in our case , what pis proposed is just horrible . 
  simple majority in lower parliament would allow for filtering out judges , which then are sent as proposal to the president . 
  however , president sent an correction to this legislature that would require 3/5 majority , which current ruling party does n't have . 
  anyhow , at this point , germany have less separated judicial branch then we have . 
  i would be happy if our gov could adjust their changes to something similar to germany one . 
  everybody would be kind of happy . 
  president already said it will not allow krs reform in current form . 
  but we will see if he will actually veto anything . 
  for now he only said he will not sign supreme court reform if they will not introduce 3/5 majority vote for krs judges . 
  in such case it will block current ruling part from picking judges by them self . 
   poland continually throwing up road blocks or refusing to play along with the eu ethos whilst being the single largest sinkhole of eu financial support . 
  why eu year by year decided to put money in that sinkhole ? 
  is it working with russian on nord stream 2 despite blocking most of a trading with russians for all other countries ? 
  what are we doing wrong ? 
  we have healthy grow , gdp , falling down deficit . 
  no bank bailouts . 
  fixing our aging population . 
  there is no economical risk from our side . 
  sure our current government needs to be constantly kept in check , but we have tools to do that , and so far it looks like it works . 
  bitch all you want , but it 's kind of a test of our democracy , and so far it 's working . 
   on top of that , they now seem to be on the path of turkey when it comes to the judiciary . 
  yeah , to much facebook news . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/b426e96c-6bd4-11e7-b9c7-15af748b60d0 seams to me like fucking opposite of a turkey . 
   the eu should throw poland the fuck out . 
  maybe it should be other way around . 
  or already it is ( uk/canada much ) ? 
  you can paint anybody in bad light if you just select negative facts , without balancing them out and putting everything into perspective . 
  we have shitload of issues to resolve and we are aware of our quite big diaspora . 
  but the only way to fix it is making living in poland better . 
  and to me it looks like we are on a good path ( it 's a little bit uphill atm ) .

   the legislative branch is chosen by voters , so there is some tiny level of accountability . 
  that 's the main difference . 
  here there will be no accountability and no separation . 
  i would welcome even slight amount of accountability . 
  problem is , in poland , judiciary branch can decide that elections were invalid . 
  so , if they will be choose by legislative branch , they can create something resembling totalitarian rule . 
  perfect scenario would be similar solution to germany . 
  where 2/3 of votes are required by council built from lower parliament , upper parliament and legislative branch representatives . 
  the new bill kind of introduces similar process , however there is major distinction . 
  second council 's 15 judges will be picked up lower parliament . 
  so in effect , this can cause state , where 2 out of 3 branches of power will be enforced by one of them , leaving only president as independent branch . 
  which in almost all cases is not true as leading party representative has bigger chance to win presidential elections . 
  so that 's why it looks bad . 
  the idea of having healthy 3 branches of power only make sense if they do n't overlay . 
  what 's a point of having judiciary branch when it 's fully elected by legislative branch ? 
  would be better if they just do everything . 
  legislative branch is mostly built from lawyers already . 
  judiciary branch should be separate . 
  maybe it should be just voted directly by people , as other branches are ? 
  or it should be voting mixed with judiciary branch representatives and legislative branch with 2/3 majority required . 
  otherwise , it does n't make sense . 
  i was skeptical about article until i ready the bill . 
  sadly it all looks as gloomy as media pictures it , in this case . 
  lower parliament with this change will be able to appoint however they want . 
  as they first elect 15 judges for second council . 
  and first councils is already fully elected by them , including supreme court chairman 's . 
  so first , current party will purge all elected council judges . 
  then elect council that will fully support them , which will bread local judges that are also in line with ruling party vision . 
  i 've nothing against introducing some sanity check . 
  fuck it , i would be even ok if they decided to create council that will be half and half , current judges and lower parliament representatives and require 2/3 votes . 
  but not this . 
  new law allows minister of justice to elect supreme court chairmans , who then sit on first council in addition to minister himself and 4 representatives from lower parliament and 2 from upper ( senat ) . 
  so it 's fully built by ruling party . 
  second council is just 15 judges elected by lower parliament . 
  same story . 
  is it the same in usa ? 
  where court system does n't have effective power to elect their own members ?
