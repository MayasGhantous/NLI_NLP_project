  actual bills : * about krs and new council that will elect judges : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/proc8.nsf/ustawy/1423_u.htm * new powers for minister of justice : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/proc8.nsf/ustawy/1491_u.htm, 
  you right ... just at the beginning . 
  maybe i did n't wanted to see it . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , immediate dismissal seems like a coup . 
  as for new judges that will join second council , it 's not specified how they will be picked . 
  or i missed it . 
  it could be part of second legislature that just entered a system but it was n't read yet . 
  i did n't know about 1491 you linked . 
  so it seams there are 2 more projects . 
  1491 and 1727 about supreme court : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/druki8ka.nsf/0/fb35352357349239c125815b00714aaa/%24file/1727.pdf damn , and 1491 was already voted as well on 12 july . 
  i think that one maybe a little bit over my head . 
  just by searching html version for ` minister ' shows some interesting parts : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/proc8.nsf/ustawy/1491_u.htm for now , i did n't find anything that would indicate who will select those 15 judges for second council . 
  maybe we should start with germany and spain , as that 's what inspired this new legislature . 
  history is written by the victors  popularity as well . 
  yeah , looks sketchy . 
  edit : -- i was wrong . 
  it looks like 15 judges will be selected by lower parliament . 
  it 's fucked up , as in the end both first and second council will be effectively elected by ruling party ( either minister of justice or lower parliament ) . 
  leaving original message for reference . 
  -- same with new build . 
  15 members are judges . 
  4 from lower parliament , 2 from senat , 1 minister of justice and 2 x supreme court chairman . 
  so , 7 members from gov. 
  15 from court system , i 'm not sure about two supreme court chairman . 
  either way , gov. 
  does n't have majority as 2/3 are required to decide which candidate should be presented to a president , which then makes his/her own decision . 
  so it 's almost 1:1 with what germany and spain has already . 
  and for now i 'm just talking about krs bill which passed lower parliament on 12 of july . 
  there is also new legislature that just entered the lower parliament and did n't even have official reading . 
  it 's much bigger project and i did n't have time yet to make myself familiar with it . 
  feel free to have a go ( provided by @ergo14 ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nemjv/polands_government_seeks_total_control_of_the/dk9ivek/, 
  this is also interesting . 
  official included opinion : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/druki8ka.nsf/0/648e7f0fb9162601c12580fe004a02b9/%24file/1423-001.pdf  z powy\u017cszych wzgl\u0119d\u00f3w , naczelna rada adwokacka opiniuje przed\u0142o\u017cony projekt ustawy negatywnie . 
  second opinion does n't say anything . 
  strange . 
  that contradicts what 's in krs bill . 
  there is explicit mention that each member of combined councils have one vote and 2/3 majority is required . 
  maybe something else was initially planed and was scrapped as this opinion is from 30 of january . 
  it 's before krs bill entered the system : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=1423, 
  krs bill does n't include any updates regarding firing . 
  it 's only update regarding accepting new candidates . 
  however , there is second bill , that just entered the system and will be voted in around 4 months . 
  it 's much bigger as it 's new project/legislature not just annotation to existing one . 
  maybe it 's there . 
  will let you know after i read it . 
  yeah , this one is quite heavy . 
  new project and not just correction as with krs one . 
  it also just entered the system . 
  not sure when then plan to vote on it . 
  looking at krs one , it took 4 months from entry to voting . 
  this one seems much bigger . 
  not sure if voting deadline is enforced based on bill size or if it 's fixed . 
  amazing . 
  thanks !, 
  could you share how did you find it ? 
  it looks like it 's fresh project : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=1727 enough time to get angry about it  140 pages . 
  a little bit bigger then krs correctional bill . 
  i recommend reading it . 
  it 's worded using simple language . 
  there is nothing fancy going on there . 
  one major issue is iterative approach , where they introduce improvements for some paragraphs . 
  it would be easier if they combined changes with old bill , to present new version . 
  as for `` prezesow sadu najwyzszego '' . 
  i 'm not sure who appoints them either . 
  and for how long . 
  `` supreme court chairman '' would be probably better translation , 
  edit . 
  aaaand i was wrong . 
  15 judges for second council are gon na be picked by lower parliament . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  leaving original message for reference -- please read an legislature before making such big statements . 
  [ here is short summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nemjv/polands_government_seeks_total_control_of_the/dk9i0e5/ ) and here is short analysis of some points introduced in op 's article . 
   the reforms are designed to put the powerful national council of the judiciary ( krs ) under parliamentary control . 
  ** false ** . 
  17 out of 7 council members will be judges . 
  2/3 are required to present given candidature to a president . 
   in the future , half of the krs ' membership is to be made up of embers of the sejm , and the other half approved by sejm-selected judges . 
  ** false ** . 
  senat will only pick two delegates . 
  there will be four delegates from sejm ( lower parliament ) . 
  minister of justice and 2 cour of law chairmains . 
  and those are members of first council . 
  second council is created from 15 judges ( using existing pool ) . 
  both councils neeed to agree on given candidature . 
  if they do n't , both councils combine and 2/3 majority is required . 
  which is hold by judges . 
  ** source ** actual legislature ( sorry , no english translation ) : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf dw is also german newspaper . 
  i welcome keeping our gov. 
  at bay , but this article seems very biased . 
  especially considering that germany can only wish to have as indpendent court system as we currently have . 
  but that 's nowhere in this article . 
  there is also second legislature , that i did n't read . 
  maybe someone will help me find it ? 
  as for my personal opnion at this point . 
  i 'm not trying to defend our gov. 
  there are some worrisome parts of this legislature , ie . 
  purge of current krs structures . 
  but people seem to go a little bit to far , thinking that government will take cover krs .
