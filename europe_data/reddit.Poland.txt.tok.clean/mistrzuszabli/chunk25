  sure , it will have bigger influence ( very similar to current federal court electoral system in germany ) . 
  but it 's not totalitarian rule . 
  judges still have the majority . 
  i would love if more people would read it and discuss specific parts , and not relay on what given newspaper wrote . 
  sadly , there is no legislature text in english :(, 
  edit -- i was wrong . 
  this is the part that destroyed my defence :  \u201e art . 
  in short , sejm ( lower parliment ) will pick 15 judges for second council . 
  which is fucked up !, 
  this is really bad . 
  thanks [ cheezburglar ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/cheezburglar ) for clarification !, 
  i leave my original message for reference below . 
  -- ok , due to all of talks about end of democracy and poland becoming second germany ( nsdap ) . 
  i decide to read whole legislature : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf it 's quite short and uses simple language . 
  ** here 's the summary : ** there will be 2 councils , and both need to agree on given candidate . 
  if they agree , candidature is presented to a president , which then have final saying ( similar to veto on legislature ) . 
  first council is sketchy , contains mostly government representatives ( minister of justice , 4 people from lower parliament , 2 from upper , and 2 x charimans of court of justice ) second council seems to be similar to what we have already . 
  this council contains 15 judges . 
  they hold separate meetings when they vote on candidate . 
  if both councils end up with different results , two councils combine and they hold a meeting where 2/3 majority is required . 
  ** council body summary ** * government connected entities : 7 * independent judges : 15 * court of law chairman : 2 ( i assume they are not connected with gov , or are they ? ), 
  at no point , gov. 
  has an majority to elect someone automatically . 
  as for process of bringing candidatures . 
  they can be either presented or someone can decide to become one . 
  open positions are published in ` monitor polski ' source : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf legislature timeline : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=1423 ** edit ** ** there seem to be 2 more legislatures ** 1491 , already voted on 12 of july ( [ thanks cheezburglar for source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nemjv/polands_government_seeks_total_control_of_the/dk9tyxu/ ) ) http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/proc8.nsf/ustawy/1491_u.htm it gives quite a few ` super powers ' to minister of justice . 
  looks like he can at will ` summon ' various court chairman 's , and as quickly dismiss them without particular reason . 
  however for now i did n't find nothing about appointing judges for second council . 
  not sure who will be responsible for that after big purge . 
  another one seems to be 1727 : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=1727 it 's about supreme court . 
  it just entered the system so it 's around 4 months from voting . 
  not sure what 's in it yet . 
  ok , i went through it all . 
  people are over reacting . 
  there will be 2 councils , and both need to agree on given candidate to appoint him .

  i 'm halfway through . 
  it seems very similar to what germany has now . 
  even a little bit better . 
  however i did n't read yet about dismissal . 
  edit . 
  i did n't find nothing about dismissal of judges . 
  so probably it 's part of old legislature . 
  yeah , the more i ready it , the more sketchy it becomes . 
  that 's very troublesome :( ~ ~ as for date . 
  i think it 's just entry date . 
  i assume it contains all corrections that were requested , as there is no other link either on legislature subpage : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/druk.xsp?nr=1423 or on legislature ` lifecycle ' page . 
  http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/przebiegproc.xsp?nr=1423~~ no , you were right . 
  wrong link . 
  there is final text of legislature at the end of the timeline : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf reading legislature was n't exactly one of my plans for the weekend :(, 
  ~ ~ read this : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/druki8ka.nsf/0/f41f9012e295d416c12580ec006b8072/%24file/1423.pdf http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/druk.xsp?nr=1423~~ thanks ergo14 for pointing out that direct link is for initial request . 
  final text can be found here : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf it 's also available in second link at the end of the timeline ( small pdf icon ) . 
  actual legislature , not ` opinion piece ' from newspapers . 
  ~ ~ it sounds very similar to what germany has . 
  including receiving recommendations from board of judges . ~ ~ further i read , i see what 's all the rumble is about . 
  thanks , not that far of from what i though . 
  it 's still very political . 
  much more political to what we have now here in poland . 
  in short , german krs is not fully independent from government ( having ruling and majority party in bundestag/tar , which they have atm ) . 
  however , pis want 's to changes us from france model ... to something that no other country in eu have :( i need to read the legislature itself . 
  if it 's as bad as people say , something needs to be done . 
  especially regarding ease of dismissal of judges , and lack of input from krs itself . 
  currently they have . 
  503 seats out of 630 ( third merkel cabinet ) . 
  but anyhow , i agree , that 's better then what pis plans to do . 
  assuming this article portrays it correctly . 
  little one in the middle saddens me most . 
  parents probably watched him go :(, 
  elected = selected through legislative system ( which requires voting ) . 
  bundestag is our sejm . 
  currently third merkel cabinet has more then 2/3 majority against opposition and bundesrat members are delegated by state governments ( not popular vote ) . 
  so there is no clear separation between government ( bundestag/bundesrat ) and court system . 
  and effectively merkel cabinet has almost totalitarian rule in that regard . 
  it 's similar in some regards to what pis plans . 
  sejm will elect them . 
  not sure what kind of majority will be required , but the process should be similar to any legislation going through sejm , which requires approval from constitutional tribunal , senat and president ( i hope ) . 
  currently our krs has no connection to government at all . 
  election is done within their own structures . 
  like a company . 
  oh come on  as i hate tvp , tvn clearly have agenda and their favorite . 
  it 's more diluted but still . 
  same goes for press . 
  i enjoyed reading gazeta wyborcza few years ago . 
  but now , you are just getting ` their ' opinion and fight against ` pis ' . 
  whatever will happen , they will just filter out negatives and paint gloomy picture . 
  the only way is experience and perspective . 
  you need to know a little bit how other gov. 
  works . 
  what various decisions in given country caused . 
  especially in emerging post com .
