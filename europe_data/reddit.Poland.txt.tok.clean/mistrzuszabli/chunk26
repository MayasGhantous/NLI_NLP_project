  markets like ours . 
  read legislature . 
  opose given points with broad perspective . 
  not just pushing ` you are destroying democracy . 
  you 're next nsdap ! ' . 
  above is good for newspapers , but politically it 's retarded . 
  and looking at this thread , that 's what 's happening . 
  this is sad state of affairs . 
  one would assume that with easy access to information , politics should be easier . 
  researching is , but still requires significant time and experience . 
  we lack atm unbiased sources . 
  but germany federal judges are also ~ ~ selected ~ ~ elected by gov. 
  does it mean they should be worried as well ? 
  where is said balance ? 
  i agree that the whole legislation is a little bit to much , especially with allowing of easy dismissal of judges without any particular reason ( i 'm not exactly sure if it 's true ) . 
  other then that , it seems like what germany has . 
  we should get angry about it , but lets think of some compromise and not just calling it ` end of democracy ' . 
  made me laugh  `` who is good boy ! '', 
  structurally , poland was and is template of democracy !, 
  current legislature branch is fully independent ( almost , constitutional tribunal is still elected by gov , krs is not , which is the topic of the reform ) . 
  where in germany , their gov select federal judges . 
  so it seems like they could learn something from us . 
  however their system is not that bad , as there is no easy way to dismiss judge other then lawful reason . 
  maybe something like that could work for us , instead what pis currently suggests . 
  if we omit gov. 
  structure . 
  yes , i agree , that we are not template of democracy . 
  people are not that interested in voting . 
  and it seems like , the general knowledge about politics and our place in a world is skewed . 
  this takes time . 
  i just hate ` defending ' our gov. 
  but at the same time , looking at this thread . 
  there is a lot of ` hate by default ' . 
  so i decided to be ` devil advocate ' here . 
  which also allows me to force myself to read given legislature and broaden my view by checking how other `` democracy templates '' setup their legislative branch . 
  so , based on that , if still , given idea seems bad to me . 
  there is a higher chance it will to andy . 
  atm . 
  it seems to my that in current form , this reform does n't have a chance to go through him . 
  some other variance , sure . 
  for example introducing more oversight , and election through sejm , but not easy way to discharge them without lawful reason ( similar to what germany has now ) . 
   that 's why saying `` the german system is similar '' while only looking at the selection process is dishonest . 
  i did n't say that !, 
  come on . 
  i only touched election part , which seems to be also ` anit-democratic ' to many . 
  as it destroys independent nature of legislative branch , which many treat as building block of healthy democracy . 
  so in short , german system is `` less democratic '' \\* to what we have now . 
  as in our case , krs is just independent body , that has no oversight . 
  i think we need some kind of compromise , that will introduce some oversight over krs , but without 1:1 connection with ruling party . 
  i did n't read new legislation . 
  do they really allow for ` on demand ' dismissal without any reason of previously elected judges ? 
  that 's fucked up . 
  \\* sorry for that . 
  i 'm just surprised how everybody is pushing ` lost democracy and immediate nsdap ' everywhere in this thread . 
  i feel i 'm missing some big ` adrian ' meme  care to enlighten me ? 
  or is it from ucho prezesa ? 
  adrian can not into office . 
  this is how it works . 
  sejm votes on something . 
  if it passes , it goes through president . 
  andrew can say fuck it , i do n't like it . 
  and then it will go back to sejm and requires 3/5 majority , which current ruling party does n't have as almost everybody is against this reform . 
  edit : -- ok , i 've had a chance to read a krs bill and skip through second one which is much bigger . 
  ** in short , it does n't look good ** . 
  it indeed initially looks like how germany does it . 
  however main difference is that this new bill allows for lower parliament to select 15 judges from supreme court that will then be responsible for filtering out judges . 
  source ( art . 
  1 ) : http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/1423_u/$file/1423_u.pdf there is also more about how they plan to create first and second council . 
  but both will be effectively elected by either minister of justice or lower parliament . 
  -- there is some chance it will be vetoed by president . 
  however i do agree that our judicial system requires reforms . 
  but this seems one step to far . 
  one question . 
  how does this differ from constitutional tribunal ? 
  they are also choosen by sejm . 
  also , it seems like german , federal court is elected by gov. 
  officials as well . 
  only state ( regional/lander ) courts are independent . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judiciary_of_germany#federal or did i misunderstood it ? 
  this is honest question . 
  i want to educate myself on that matter . 
  any resources would be helpful . 
  i just could n't at the end . 
  hand holding circle . 
  just amazing . 
  he is wearing this season ` la corruption ' . 
  damn , and i though we had it bad here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_supermarket_chains_in_poland  die umarmung des todes . 
  however , i see lidles and kauflands , next to each other everywhere . 
  also , counting zabka as supermarket is a little bit stretch . 
  convience store is more like it . 
  this may clear it up a little bit better : http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-usa-trump-factbox-idukkbn19p0u1 in addition to gas , they want to also improve north-south transport ( highways etc ) . 
  seems like strategic move to diversify our import/export dependencies . 
  which should benefit everyone . 
  at least on paper , 
  sorry , could n't resist . 
  g20 seems like family reunion . 
  with lots of divorces and new uncles . 
  can confirm , it was quite nice today . 
  sunny , light cold wind , perfect humidity . 
  almost decided to get out .
