  for some reason i feel a need to listen to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u06jlgpmtqs, 
  nice use of titanium white . 
  amazing . 
  this and austria are my favorite . 
  i just imagined some polish entrepreneurs speaking mixed marsian and polish with healthy mix of native language and kurwas . 
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtduubwgtpu * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tslqi1dol6a * ack , ack , ack , kurwa !, 
  true , source driven journalism !, 
   ... one senior eu official called poland 's push towards `` self-ghettoisation '' . 
   ... another eu diplomat said about the three seas project . 
   ... `` we are monitoring it , '' said a czech government source . 
  `` but we do n't put much weight on it at the moment . '', 
   ... said one european official , who declined to be named . 
  so , it either means that everybody is fucking scared to speak out or justyna pawlak , author of this article have entourage of imaginary friends . 
  w can not into space , but we can into any other job market . 
  will see . 
  if not poland , there is vast number of countries to choose from . 
  is n't it part of advantages of eu ? 
  it all depends how well brexit will go . 
  but atm , uk does n't look that stable . 
  sure , it still easier to get the job there and live comfortable life . 
  but it 's not that vivid as few years ago . 
  i 'm not in the mood . 
  [ let 's save bulgaria !, 
  ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=bulgarian+women&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjqrc3g_dtuahvdijokhysialyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=904 ), 
  if they are still polish citizens , should n't their children count towards polish population , not uk ? 
  never forget :( https://www.google.pl/search?q=poland+portugal+euro+2016&amp;oq=poland+portugal, 
  at least now it all makes sense . 
  polandball forever :(, 
  got it , thanks for explanation . 
   forced market liberation of norwegian politics could you explain what you mean by that ? 
  do you mean in short : `` losing independence '' ? 
  why ? 
  if norway gov. 
  is leading towards anti-eea sentitment , would n't uk make it easier to negotiate changes with eu , to make efta less strict etc ? 
  you went easy on poland . 
  or does it mean you just do n't care ... 
  it hurt 's even more then idea of putting john paul ii fucking syrian children . 
  or , you know , death camps would work as well . 
  but flipped flag . 
  are you poland op ? 
  they will leave eu , join efta which they are co-founders of and previous member . 
  switzerland is more then willing to invite them back . 
  norway switches their story from initial open arms to worries about inviting someone bigger then them . 
  but it could be just political play on their part to make eu - uk negotiations spicier . 
  in the end , not much will change . 
  open borders will remain with some additional regulations . 
  efta members needs to follow set of rules that will probably be similar to what uk follows now : http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features#4, 
  uk was already part of efta from 1960 - 1973 and it 's an co-founder . 
   in the first meeting since the brexit vote , efta reacted by saying both that they were open to a uk return , and that britain has many issues to work through . 
  the president of switzerland johann schneider-ammann stated that its return would strengthen the association . 
  [ 25 ] however , in august 2016 the norwegian government expressed reservations . 
  norway 's european affairs minister , elisabeth vik aspaker , told the aftenposten newspaper : `` it 's not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation . 
  it would shift the balance , which is not necessarily in norway 's interests . 
  '' [ 26 ] source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#former_members switzerland loves the idea of uk going back to efta . 
  norwegian gov was initially open , and now it 's a little bit worried about letting big country in . 
  it 's strange they were n't worried about it before . 
  also , how it 's in the end decided . 
  each efta member is voting on membership proposal ? 
  is given country only allowed when everybody is for it ? 
  why not ? 
  both countries are in 5 mil . 
  population ballpark . 
  so it 's much cheaper to organize . 
  i personally think there should be clear law dictating when you can do re-referendums on same topic in short intervals . 
  what was the cause for re-referendums in ireland and denmark ? 
   causes : drinking alcohol during pregnancy [ 1 ]  prevention : avoiding drinking alcohol during pregnancy [ 4 ], 
  they for sure make for interesting watch . 
  lately house of cards it 's quite boring in comparison to world politics . 
  maybe that 's a new strategy . 
  question is , were their decision driven by their religion views ? 
  or is there some kind of christian branch where slavery is purest form of modesty ? 
  i do n't think poles here on reddit share the same prejudice towards romanians . 
  i do n't . 
  as for crying foul . 
  if they have polish citizenship , they are polish . 
  end of story . 
  we all agree that rule of law is important . 
  but let 's think of something that would scare/motivate everybody equally . 
  which will be quite hard without federalization . 
  what about cutting vat income from a single market . 
  especially if some country starts to break specific single market rules . 
  funds could be part of it as well , especially if some country did n't use them efficiently or just played the system . 
  let 's try to think of punishments related and close to a ` crime ' . 
  as for funds itself . 
  i think progresivelly we need to get rid of them . 
  at least in current form which is very unbalanced and it 's becoming a political tool . 
  i did n't say that . 
  what i meant is , that some countries can easily swallow such punishment or even include it as part of a ` budget ' . 
  same things is happening now with big banks . 
  they just put monetary punishments as a cost of doing ` risky ' business . 
  `` we can afford to manipulate libor , in the end we will still benefit out of it . '', 
  another example , ireland . 
  what if eu would like minimalize tax heavens . 
  i 'm not sure if cutting funds , would be feasible punishment for them . 
  so , i did n't meant germany specificly . 
  i agree that we need to make enforicing eu law more efficent and realistic . 
  however , i 'm not sure if it will be easy task without federalization . 
  i 'm not sure if ikea will keep up with demand . 
  final self assembly solution . 
  fs\u00c4s !,
