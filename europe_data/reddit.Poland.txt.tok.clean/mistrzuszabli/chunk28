  and what to do with countries that are net contributors . 
  what kind of incentive does germany plan for them ? 
  why are you looking at me like that ? 
  sweeden , are you ok ? 
  nobody is defending anyone . 
  but you can not deny that there was a little to much attention and panic for our gov. 
  but you do n't care what 's happening after newspapers run out of catchy titles and move to another sensation like trump nowadays . 
  we know we face some issues . 
  govs come and go . 
  if you want to feel better , one we have is the worst we can do ( i hope ) . 
  and despite that it 's going fairly good ( we expected total devastation ) . 
  however , i do n't understand what net contribution has to do with having more power . 
  is it how sweeden works ? 
  do people that pay more taxes or earn more have bigger voting power there ? 
  i think you could learn few things from `` eastern brothers '' . 
  i could live with that . 
  [ take me like it 's 1648 , i 'm wet already . 
  [ somehow this made me want to listen to rammstein . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/khm3nih85xg?t=137 ), 
  they could spend it mostly on research . 
  [ sweeden , how you doin '  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjq1xd6ul-4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8 ), 
  crown of aragon !, 
  i must admit that tone of conversation about this issue changed a lot here . 
  few months ago it would be mostly about `` fucking xenophobic , solidarity hating polar bears riding plumbers '' . 
  and now i see mostly understanding tone . 
  i still think we should offer some help to refuges . 
  after being sure we are prepared to do so . 
  as for quotas and dublin resolution , i did n't like it at the beginning , and i do n't like it now . 
  anyhow , we need more genetic variance here in poland ... maybe i 'm just getting desperate and i watched to much [ lawrence of arabia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aarayjgm_ra ) . 
  however , the ending does n't exactly encourage my position/believe . 
  you wish !, 
  how can it be so low when pit is 18 % in ukraine ? 
  is it due to export nature of services ? 
  what about health care ? 
  if you have sole proprietorship in poland , you pay flat 19 % pit and fixed minimum of 1100 pln for healthcare and pension fund + other social services . 
  but standard contract of employment has total tax even higher then 30 % , which is partially paid by employee . 
  anyhow , far away from 5 %  on the other hand , it looks like ukraine gov. 
  could use some money . 
  i saw that they introduced temporary 1.5 % war tax that is planned to add $ 290 million to a budget . 
  can only speak of ukrainians in krakow . 
  i heard one story , when my ukrainian friend was mistaken for russian and received some xenophobic comments . 
  me personally i heard only two instances of ` kind of xenophobia ' . 
  first one was in wc , where two young polish guys were complaining that there are too many ukrainians , and they hear russian speaking people everywhere in buses . 
  second instance of xenophobia was towards uk tourists from older , drunk couple . 
  husband screamed that they should go home . 
  but his wife started screaming at him , and reminded him that most of their friends are in uk . 
  other then that smooth sailing . 
  at least in bigger cities . 
  no idea what 's going on in smaller ones . 
  it 's for sure something brand new for us . 
  as for politics , sure , there is some tension . 
  but i personally do n't care . 
  thanks for your insight !, 
  yeap , heard the same thing regarding it sector . 
  i 'm not sure how they managed to get taxed so low but it was closer to 10 then 20 %  do n't remember exact number . 
  probably their services were treated as ` export ' . 
  also , another point i heard , but this time from management . 
  lot 's for businesses decide to move out of ukraine due to instability . 
  people were given opportunity to stay with given firm , but were required to move to new country . 
  i 've noticed the same thing with people from my city . 
  lot 's of them decided to move abroad due to lack of good paying jobs here . 
  what was main drive for your friends to move here ? 
  from my drunk talks with my ukrainian friends , it mostly was due to required army draft . 
  love it . 
  i met lots of ukrainians in krakow . 
  nothing but a great people . 
  it 's crazy how quickly they learn polish . 
  got it . 
  damn , i did n't know that . 
  seems hypocritical . 
  i heard lot 's of comment from eu towards uk , that there is no access to open market without open borders . 
  good times . 
  i fully agree . 
  i just pointed out how they cover it up . 
  but there is one advantage of this . 
  it 's clearly visible  slowly , those groups hide behind more and more layers of sugar , until you get to their true vision of purity for given country . 
  i think onr slowly starts doing that . 
  those are parties like ukip in europe : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_for_direct_democracy_in_europe ukip is like korwin mikke party here in poland . 
  this is another level . 
  tough ` love '  they are in love with their vision of poland . 
  sadly , ideologically , it 's not my poland . 
  but what 's poland . 
  is it us , is it our history , or both combined and constantly changing . 
  anyhow i 'm all for fair assessment of their performance in 2016 . 
  and i also noticed that there is shitload of misinformation towards them . 
  you know what i decided to do . 
  for one year , i focused on raw information . 
  no opinions and picking on ` you what did he say ?!?! ' . 
  instead i focused on plans , executions and numbers . 
  and if you take that into account , you may understand why some people start to defend them . 
  opposition is painting a armageddon picture . 
  they were more then sure that we will fucking dissolve economically after what they planned for a first years . 
  and they planned some heavy shit : * attacked banks * gave poor families support money * decreased pension age * fuck over vat tax cheaters . 
  despite that , budget for 2016 end up being smaller then planned ( not much but still ) . 
  wig20 is back on a rise and close to previous gov levels . 
  rating agencies calmed down after last year results . 
  gdp did n't hit planned increase but it was still at manageable level . 
  that 's what numbers say . 
  but if we focus on media . 
  it indeed looks shitty .
