  * public tv is at horrible state . 
  they are bluntly focused on defending current gov. 
  * i do n't understand why they hate donald tusk so much . 
  not voting for him for eu president was shitty move . 
  and their argumentation was even worse ( each eu member should ` confirm ' if their countrymen can be eu president . 
  some kind of ` self ' veto ) . 
  digging out victim bodies . 
  despite plea from families to abandon that idea . 
  * focusing to much on how much and who fucked us during and after ww 2 . 
  * too much controversy . 
  very disruptive party . 
  they do n't scream ` balance ' and ` safety ' . 
  we lost momentum in financial world after pis got elected . 
  * too much christ and good for my test . 
  i just hope that maybe opposition will learn a little bit , and will try to create balanced opposition , one that will not say yes to everything eu proposes , but at the same time create balanced and investor safe vision of poland . 
  however currently they seem to focus to much on ` bringing down government ' or ` bringing freedom back ' , instead of realistic plan to win next election and propose something that will hit a middle ground between crazy nationalism and being dummy proxy for eu . 
  they do n't use nazi symbols . 
  they use original versions ( roman salute , slavic swastika ) . 
  of course it 's bullshit mental gymnastics , because their ideology is closer to nazism then modern paganism ... or roman culture . 
  for example onr vision of polish citizen looks like : * loves god and christ . 
  * is white . 
  * hates eu or any form of globalization . 
  if you have different shade of skin or do n't believe in one on only ... you are not polish . 
  of course , publicly , they only focus on god part and guarding our culture and legacy . 
  which should automatically somehow make poland stronger . 
   their politicians already have the theoretical groundwork for an exit-referendum . 
  not if growth will be based on connection to single market . 
  which should be a general target for eu . 
  if single market will be of no value to anybody , i 'm not sure if we will survive solely on ` idea ' of being together . 
  another topic is federalization . 
  but that will be tough nut . 
  they are eu ` conservative ' . 
  they are not in love with some of eu laws like migration one . 
  but they fully support eu and see poland as a valued member that can bring some new perspective to eu politics . 
  we hear a lot about them due to a little bit nationalistic vibe they give . 
  they love poland a little bit to much . 
  same for christian god . 
  but as for policies go , in my opinion they did better in 2016 then i though . 
  however they require constant monitoring ( abortion law ) . 
  from my perspective , the worst part about pis is that they put some really hot headed people in charge of ministries . 
  they spout some next level shit . 
  but luckily they do n't follow up on their words . 
  as for pure anti eu policies . 
  i do n't remember any . 
  of course there is ongoing issue with constitutional tribunal and law in general . 
  eu is not happy about current state of blindness of our law . 
  [ what a joker !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lfiqxr7s76y?t=5 ) ehh ... 
  eh , it 's just like watching your parents divorce . 
  i love them both . 
  yeah . 
  let 's drop from it together , it will have similar [ gdp significance ] ( https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:swe:gbr:rom:ita:fra:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-305344800000&amp;tend=1430258400000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) we are far away from our bigger sister and brothers : germany , uk , france , italy and spain . 
  also , what 's up with all that hate ? 
  one government change that is not blindly in love with eu and we should get kicked out . 
  that 's nice partnership right there !, 
  government will change . 
  but i will fucking remember . 
  i will @luclinn !, 
  you are right . 
  looking at charts , poland was really trusting eu ( 75 % in 2007 ) . 
  then we had similar values . 
  germany trust felt 10 % between 2009 and 2010 . 
  from 50 % to 40 % . 
  and it actually went up 10 % between 2015 and 2016 ( 31 % -41 % ) . 
  but general trend is worrying , looking at range from 2007-2016 . 
  source : http://bruegel.org/2017/03/european-spring-trust-in-the-eu-and-democracy-is-recovering/ anyhow , this is good !, 
  i want to see more honest information . 
  i want to see good , bad and ugly here at / r/europe !, 
  i do n't want to just wake up one they and notice that half of our continent hates eu itself . 
  that does n't look good . 
  seems like terrorist attacks had huge effect on eu . 
  do i see correctly ? 
  germany and france has lower trust in eu then poland ? 
   '' ... and involved girls aged between 11 and 17 '' . 
  i appreciate reporting and keeping it on / r/europe . 
  did you miss last few years and issue with spreading miss information in media , including internet ? 
  people in general do n't brand themself as one group . 
  they are swinging based on current issues and political climat . 
  if both saids just stop discussing and assume position to call themself stupid . 
  that will be trully shitty way of going down . 
  ** it 's like using stupidity as deterent for change . 
   `` rainbow in poland '' . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc8dlq9pues https://vimeo.com/75211343 https://vimeo.com/82039198, 
   i previosly stated , most of these points are based on ignorance and even slight racism and feelings of superiority over others . 
  i just can not believe that germany does n't feel more superior to poland economically . 
  that 's just a fact . 
  they are . 
  sure , it 's more like older brother sibling kind of superiority vibe but still . 
   ... most of these points are based on ignorance and even slight racism ... how it 's ignorant ? 
  naturally difference in cultures brings some issues , you can not deny it . 
  how is it racist ? 
  this point is not bringing any specific group to light . 
  you can embrace multiculturalism but you naturally need to prepare for transition time . 
  or do you naivly believe that everybody will play nicely with everyone out of the box , where people habits differ hugely in some cases ? 
  so , some anit-eu people with above vision are just afraid . 
  afraid of loosing given country identity . 
  afraid of rising aggresion and safety . 
  how do we ensure above people that we are in eu for good and bad . 
  that 's a challange for upcoming years . 
  but calling all of them stupid , racist , nacionalist is counterproductive .
