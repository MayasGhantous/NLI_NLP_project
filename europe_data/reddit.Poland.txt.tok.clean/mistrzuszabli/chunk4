  some of smaller isp have 1gb/1gb options for 29 euros . 
  that 's amazing . 
  nice . 
  do you maybe know if there is some coverage map of various local isp in wroclaw/warszawa/krakow ? 
  could be . 
  here in poland , upc seems to be most popular choice among fastest isp options . 
  it 's 250/20mbit . 
  uploads speeds are quite shitty . 
  and it 's [ usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upc_broadband ) company providing internet service for european countries . 
  but in our case they were quite better then what we had before . 
  there are also smaller local isp in given cities , that offer better uploads but they have often limited coverage . 
  4 min to download 30 gb of data . 
  8 min to upload it . 
  lucky bastards !, 
  do other countries have even 1000mb/500mb offers ? 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ it looks like digi is providing such option in various countries , including romania and hungary . ~ ~ actually the company offering it is home grown . 
  impressive . 
  you can feed family of 4k tv 's with that . 
  i think in such cases they freeze accounts until investigation is over . 
  and if they are silently still investigating i 'm sure they would love them to continue spending money illegally to collect evidence . 
  in the end , it 's all speculation . 
  what we know now it 's that bank decided to close their account for no specific reason . 
  officially . 
  can they say no to gay couple if it 's against their christian roots ? 
  to be honest , i think they should put some explanation behind it . 
  even if it means they did for political reasons . 
  should then eu banks decide to drop uk clients after brexit and latest spying revelations ? 
  i think if they put just clear explanation that they do n't support current russian global politics , it would make more sense . 
  but i 'm not exactly sure if blocking newspaper is a valid way to go about it . 
  what 's next . 
  russia should close totally for west media ? 
  next korea ? 
  were did rt lied ? 
  bbc put this clickbait title and then change it . 
  even rt editor said they were closing their accounts . 
  i though fn is wwe of news outlets . 
  do you have any examples ? 
  went through some topics from their main page . 
  does n't seem to be that bad . 
  i remember some good materials from time when they were n't state owned . 
  now it looks like just washed down state news agency . 
  most scans are `` photoshoped '' . 
  and to be precise , they are going through image processing . 
  there is not reason at all to photoshop it , as bank itself confirmed their intentions . 
  how cute germany  i think you may know answer to that .

  i 'm not looking for minimum . 
  i 'm looking at what 's possible . 
  i assume that private sector offers at least 3x times that . 
  some data from 2015 : agh : http://www.solidarnosc.agh.edu.pl/pliki/agh_porozumienie2.pdf position | salary 2015 | salary 2013 | salary/min wage | euro --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- professor | 14 950 pln | 11 500 pln | 8.0 x | 3 471 adiunct | 8 970 pln | 6 900 pln | 4.8 x | 2 082 assistant | 4 660 pln | 3 660 pln | 2.5 x | 1 082 they have comfortable salary and it 's rising rapidly . 
  and as far as i know , they have time to have additional jobs in private sector . 
  sure , it 's not perfect if you compare to other countries . 
  but based on our cost of living it 's not that bad . 
  source for 2013 data : http://www.solidarnosc.agh.edu.pl/pliki/porozumienie_podwyzki_2013.pdf ** edit ** i went a little bit overboard . 
  it seems to be some kind of legal maximum . 
  not sure how much professors actually earn in 2015-2016 in agh . 
  university directors earn around 30k + 5-8k in bonuses monthly , but i do n't think their salary is any indicator how much professors can get .

  here you have some more : https://500px.com/jandanek, 
  i just ca n't wait for new witcher movie . 
  i hope it will be shot in poland using similar technique . 
  at least for some establishing shots . 
  photo was made by this guy . 
  nothing short of amazing : https://500px.com/jandanek, 
  you are golden hour master  love this one especially : https://500px.com/photo/158168967/in-the-mirror-by-jan-danek?ctx_page=1&amp;from=user&amp;user_id=4829980, 
  amazing  great photo . 
  do you have some gallery i could check ? 
  is this photo actually from this month ? 
  it 's like god 's cocaine crumbs . 
  wan na buy a deutsche cds ? 
  banks never go down , never !, 
  or maybe you will be interested in new hot [ derivative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ) on a market . 
  too soon , 
  choose your clients wisely . 
  i actually want him back  to have some meaningful opposition , not what we have now . 
  bromania !, 
  keep it comming guys . 
  people assume that i want to defend them . 
  pis politicians are still at fault of pushing it through initial phase . 
  but they are not ones that made this project . 
  they also do not fully agree with all parts . 
  just want to present more broad view . 
  but i understand that people react emotionally according to their personal view . 
  i already saw here opinion that we have same abortion law as ireland , which is totally untrue . 
  ireland have now what those christian lawers want to push in poland . 
  when pregnancy threatens a life of a mother , abortion is allowed in ireland . 
  that 's the only way there . 
  if there was fatality case maybe mother decided to go for it either way . 
  i can understand such decision when not forced by government . 
  no they do n't . 
  please stop spreading misinformation . 
  ireland has what those christian lawmakers want to push for here in poland . 
  currently in ireland : * abortion is not legal in ireland in cases of rape , incest or foetal anomaly .
