  they still might prefer to join the scandinavian bunch though ... 
  as a polish person - i get the picture . 
  i love this thread :d, 
  how is it a false assumption ? 
  so you are planning to invest in building new houses in poland ? 
  because poland is going to accept 7000 people and thats basically as much housing as we can afford now . 
  i 've been always asking myself and still i ca n't answer this question : why is it that on scandinavian tv ** some ** kind of debate is possible and on polish tv ** no ** debate is possible ? 
  do you think poland has free housing and those poeple wouldnt sleep outside in poland ? 
  now , think again . 
  and again . 
  lol , fighting for your homeland as a hideous idea ... 
  the idiot future minister already started withdrawing from that . 
  now he 's saying that he needs safety guarantees and that poland needs to be able to pick whom we take . 
  i bet it 'll soon be a silent `` okaaay '' because he 'll realize some laws can not be broken . 
  right now he 's just masturbating to his voters and trying to show whose dick is bigger . 
  a very unfortunate occasion to measure dicks right after over 100 people were murdered . 
  but i agree that poland can not afford more than we were assigned , at least until we see how we cope with the situation at hand . 
  because poland does not know how to do these things yet . 
  it 's syrian and iraqi business . 
  if they do n't want to be killed and run away why polish guys would want to be killed for them ? 
  no , no and no . 
  so what ? 
  when you go to a football match you need an id . 
  almost everywhere in europe, 
  nothing will change and nothing will be done to prevent it , because nothing can be done . 
  this will happen every now and then . 
  this is the worst part . 
  sure . 
  for the first time ... 
  no it 's a form of dicriminatory way of thinking , not racism as islam is not a race . 
  you just love the word racism dont you . 
  no , there were more famous british women than that . 
  i know what you will be trying to prove here , but just do n't . 
  no , it is not great and i did n't say it , you added that . 
  an amount of basic human decency is necessary and i 'd love to have a bit more of it in poland . 
  but with you guys the whole idea of deconstructing the oppressive societal norms went overboard . 
  it became an undisputed , natural norm , nobody discusses it in a calm manner . 
  whenever it gets critized you , and personally you , start screaming that 90 % of those poeple criticizing your doctrine and dominant discourse is a far right extremist . 
  you are blind and indoctrinated , you have no control over the course of events and you have no self-criticism or self-checking mechanisms . 
  the worst part is that human rights and fight against racism and discrimination are crucial for peace and wellbeing - and ** you make a caricature out of them . 
  cliche , people are also afraid of what they know . 
  it is all the matter of the dominant discourse . 
  eastern europe is less politically correct . 
  it 's hasnt become a social norm here yet to be politically correct as it has in western europe . 
  i find eastern europeans less hypocritical on this matter . 
  i would n't always believe all the data that is shown here . 
  or even all the official data . 
  poland still is pro-eu but it 's gradually changing and i 'm terrified by leaders who push for this change . 
  i think many maaany polish people ( but not the majority yet ) get very sceptical about the eu . 
  but it 's a subject for a different thread . 
  the dismantling of the eu sounds like a nightmare to me . 
  you live in a world of illusions and dreams friend, 
  so if it 's people from camps from greece and italy , then italy and greece have to figure that out or romania , hungary etc ? 
  and if those people run away to sweden or germany , then who is to force them back where they are assigned ? 
  if those people are in germany ( because that 's where they want to live ) and hungary is unwilling to take them , how is it hungary 's job to force them to move to hungary ? 
  or is it germany 's job , because germany wants to get rid of illegals ? 
  if people repeatedly run away let 's say from poland and want to live in germany , is it for poland to figure out how to get them from germany and live in poland ? 
  how do you think germany can force a ) refugees that do n't want to live anywhere else to leave germany , b ) countries that do not necessarily want the refugees to effectively and actively keep them within borders . 
   handcuffed in a bus . 
  do you really want to relocate people by force and you consider it feasible ? 
  it 's immoral and its going to cost a lot of money . 
  it also requires unprecedented amounts of european consensus and multinational cooperation and very good organization . 
  it also looks ugly on tv . 
  are you okay with all these ? 
  is your answer to all of this by force and handcuffed ? 
  i asked you this question already , twice actually , and you never answered : how can this forced relocation be done ? 
  what should be the procedures to transport people unwilling to go to a place ? 
  how should refugees be treated if they do not want to go to hungary or poland or romania ? 
  young males dominated culinary thread . 
  terrible , just terrible ... you all motherfuckers need [ goose ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dokpuiy3oyy/urcl3egnhoi/aaaaaaaasfo/evzupemkd9a/s1600/2013_10_05_jedzonko2.jpg ) it 's apparently goose season in poland ( i say every season can be a goose season ) and this is a recipe for [ goose with apple and buckwheat stuffing ] ( http://www.tastingeurope.com/traditional-dishes/polish-goose ) . 
  the best thing in the world . 
  it does n't necessarily has to be that , i agree , but unfortunatelly i think it very often results from cultural study wannabes ' unhealthy ardor to decontruct the world . 
  which is sad because cultural studies could do well without the pr from people like this woman . 
  i actually think that the concept is in a way marxist at the root . 
  but that 's not exactly what the op said . 
  i 'm going to say something `` marxist '' now : if for you it seems that this woman `` naturally '' became a promoter of diversity , because it 's something that just happens , means that you look at reality without much scrutiny . 
  studies based on marx and gramsci 's would say that what this woman represents is a result of cultural hegemony of the higher middle class that promote political correctness . 
  she 's not a diversity officer because it is only natural and that 's how things should be but because there 's a lot of ideology and social `` norms '' that made her become that . 
  in academia - it 's a `` norm '' to be politically correct . 
  it 's funny how people like her do not apply cultural study analysis to themselves . 
  they forgot where they come from . 
  they lack self-scrutiny . 
  open the links that i provided and read . 
  your personal predilection for certain type of company has nothing to do with this case here . 
  you can be whatever and hang out wih whomever . 
  you do n't have a complex ideology and system of knowledge to explain why you want that particular type of company . 
  however , people with academic bacground who happen to be this type of `` feminists '' or `` diversity promoters '' base their world view on cultural studies or rather i 'd say on a skewed interpretation of cultural studies . 
  this bitch should be ostracized . 
  she 's the reason why i have to defend myself when i say i 'm a feminist . 
  edit : i do n't understand by the way why being marxist has to be always questioned and frowned upon . 
  marxist is okay . 
  stalinist is not okay . 
  marxist commissar , not marxist diversity promotion . 
  [ cultural studies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_studies ) , [ cultural hegemony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_hegemony ) , but okay , for a consensus i 'd say more like gramscian commissar , but the intuition was good  i do n't get it : why do you act like you dont understand, 
  r-hugger is the sweetest !, 
  are you suggesting smugglers should consider working pro bono ? 
  is that lady holding a picture of a dead migrant and a #migrantswelcome title ? 
  its ... its nasty, 
  muslims also sent man to the moon in 17th century or sometime around ... 
  could you please answer my question from earlier today abt how this could be done ?
