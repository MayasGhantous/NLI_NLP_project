  what is ukraine ? 
  part of its territories is eastern europe , but the greater part is a gift from us . '' vladimir putin . 
  speaking to george h. bush at the nato bucharest summit , april 4 , 2008 . 
  [ 24 ] originally reported in kommersant.ru . 
  can you comment on this ? 
  die downvotes : *, 
  i came to a conclusion that western european redditors just do n't catch the eastern european nuances too quickly so they do n't understand what the problem is . 
  for them what putin does is a theoretical issue . 
  the only thing that will ever happen to them is that they 'll have more topics to discuss . 
  the worst case scenario is that if anything bad happens theyll get more immigrants . 
  the sentence `` i understand that you used to be opressed , ** but ** ... '' does n't really do anything except it shows us that they really do not get it . 
  for them we are russophobes . 
  polish people , for example , are a first class russophobes  i mean ... 
  i 'm polish and when i read through a discussion here , i pay more attention to things russia-flagged people say , what lithuanians and ukrainians say and for me it 's always like you said ( though i think you talked also about real life , right ? ) . 
  honestly , there 's no single russian-flagged user that i 'd like to follow reading , not to mention discuss with . 
  i 'm still looking for him/her , though . 
  well , i might be a russophobe if we come to the root of the word , a phobia being a fear of something ... ** kmmeerts ** , so you talked to russians and they do not condemn the ekhm actions ( not anexing , right ? ), 
  in crimea . 
  how to put it . 
  you 're one of those who base their whole standpoint on `` i hate the russian government but i love the russian people '' thing , right ? 
  and since you believe in * demokratia * and stuff like this you 'll probably keep believing that the russian people are the real voice so whatever they say it has to be right , just and a thing to do . 
  you probably believe that what they learn at school is an unbiased vision of history , history seen from those many points of view that russia as a landmass and an ethnic mixture has , that the russian young are taught to always be critical , watchful and skeptical of any official versions of anything , that history is a construct etc. 
  do a research , but an honest one , and see what they learn about the soviet union , about the `` freeing '' of my country , about the russian civilization . 
  jeezus , what do you really want to say ? 
  just say it , why do you even bother to pretend your actually discuss anything . 
  just say it . 
  there is no such country as ukraine , its a part of russia , youre so transparent . 
  not unelected ? 
  then ... corrupt anyway !, 
  right ? 
  i bet youre russian or of russian origin . 
  or you have a russian so , or work with russian immigrants a lot . 
  you guys are just aaaall the saaame , its sooooo boring . 
  nothing new to read , same stuff each time . 
  i never really hoped and i never expected the western europe to give a fuck about whats going on in ukraine . 
  things have been going for a long time now and they just let it happen , watching the situation deteriorate year after year as if it had been giving the some pleasure . 
  so no . 
  i dont even believe they 'd do much if these things were going on in poland . 
  cause we all belong to the eastern block , obviously . 
  ( still , life in europe is better ), 
  oh , russian friends , hey , we all have them !, 
  there 's this funny thing about eastern immigrants in western europe that when you ask them abt putin , why they like him and stuff , they 'll tell you cause he 's so rich and powerful . 
  then you ask them and what about your family back in russia , nice income , house and car ? 
  oh , no im of humble origins , family poor , but russia strong and mighty . 
  how do you like it here in london , aarhus , stockholm , dusseldorf ? 
  western world is full of faggots , it 's weak and inferior to russia . 
  oh , and america is evil . 
  why do you want russia to get bigger and bigger ? 
  isnt it big enough ? 
  russia is never big enough . 
  but why do you guys need more clay ?!, 
  to be so proud of big big russia !, 
  so why do you live here in london , aarhus , stockholm , dusseldorf ? 
  ... talking to them abt russia vs western europe is like talking to schizophrenics . 
  i dont know , do you think russia is some kind of a savior for the opressed working masses ? 
  that they do not spy on their citizens cause snowden says so ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  what kind of propaganda have you been exposed to ? 
  your eastern immigrant friends ? 
  dont take everything the immigrants tell you so fucking seriously , use your own brain from time to time , read a book or two . 
  you hate america ? 
  great , hate america , but if it means you automatically have to love russia youre braindead . 
  meh , you dont know shit , spanish person . 
  you live too far to care . 
  go drink your wine , get some sunshine and think not about all those russians past the oder river ... no , seriously , you westerners are all a bunch of fucking ignoramus . 
  we learn your stupid history in primary schools and you still know nothing abou the ` new europe ' . 
  you dont even fucking care to get your fucking basic facts straight . 
  i think this is a stupid question . 
  or at least formulated in a very ... provocative way . 
  it basically makes us say : definitely a slut or definitely not a slut . 
  there may be so many reasons why a person would have such sex life . 
  for one thing , i do not think it would be fully socially accepted anywhere . 
  eeeeeven in the netherlands ... 
  the reasons why and the way the person does it is important here , not the number of people she fucked . 
  if she has an enormous sex appetite but at the same time is responsible and respects herself - it 's fine . 
  lots and lots of good sex cant be bad for people . 
  if she earns this way , well , its a job , right ? 
  but if she 's reckless , spreads stds , does n't have any control over her sex drives and inside really hates herself , well , i pity her . 
  i would n't like to be her shrink  6/10 of my girl friends in poland would say `` good for her '' , 4/10 `` slut '' 9/10 of guys i know would say `` slut '' ... but they 'd probably want to meet her personally . 
  for a night . 
  but my friends are not a comprehensive sample . 
  edit : i read your comments , geoatreides , and you make it all sound very personal and emotional . 
  just my impression . 
  poland will what ? 
  `` sponsor '' ? 
  what does it even mean !? 
  this is surely a mistake . 
  poland can not into sponsor !, 
  ( though ... sponsor can into poland , eh ... ), 
  yes , because wars start with declarations :d :d :d :d funny funny funny !, 
  http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/2120134/rainbow/ omg , but this really happened !, 
  it really did !, 
  right wing idiots burnt an art installation representing a rainbow :d but i love the comic even without a context , 
  google `` polish people grumpy rude do n't smile '' http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/2012/12/cheer-up.html#.uysmwlf5ozc eh ... :(, 
  it 's the same here in poland . 
  i mean , people just dont smile too much in public and get very suspicious when foreigners come here happy , smiling and all . 
  or at least it 's how foreiners perceive us . 
  from my experience , i know for sure that polish people smile a lot and laugh - also in public , russians are very relaxed , talkative and friendly , ukrainians are best jokers and flirt a lot . 
  and this is how many poles in my environment perceive our eastern neighbors in person-to-person relations . 
  no , no , i 'm not talking about any `` festive behaviors '' , i just have this feeling , i do n't know ... it looks like they are paralyzed inside , i do n't know how to explain it .
