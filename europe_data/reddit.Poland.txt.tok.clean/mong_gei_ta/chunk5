  people in majdan in ukraine spoke in a different way . 
  they seemingly felt much more confident . 
  i was just curious if anyone noticed it too , or maybe i 'm just imagining things - might be the case . 
  it 's funny , there 's the same stereotype about poland !, 
  i 'm not talking about smiling , i just ... have the feeling that ... yeah , well , their public speaking is strange . 
  i do n't know . 
  why do the speakers seem so ... stiff ? 
  some of them look grim , some totally terrified or its some kind of cultural difference i havent known about . 
  you saw no adolescents and young adults in ukraine 's majdan ? 
  please , write more , please !, 
  im not ironic or anything , youre really the first user here who claims he 's russian and whom i really want to read !!!, 
  do you have any public intellectuals discussing this stuff right now ? 
  i mean , something that is in english and is non-cringe material ? 
  unstable countries ? 
  poland ? 
  czech republic ? 
  o_o oh my god , what did they do to you !, 
  do you even read newspapers ? 
  you guys believe youre an island in the sea , youre so ... so pathetic , meh ... 
  either way , it 's betrayal to me . 
  but well , nihil novi sub sole , right ? 
  especially `` no matter what people inside them think '' , especially, 
  yeah , only read headlines , bitch please . 
  why do n't you submit the youtube link without the rt bullshit ? 
  why the anger ? 
  i 'm just saying that graphic representations of statistics are to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  to me , this picture shows that countries with catholic majority are less violent towards women . 
  but i do n't believe it . 
  i need to read the research article to be convinced otherwise . 
  do n't hate me for this . 
  catholics violate less  or they report less . 
  or they consider hitting a woman not an act of violence . 
  so yeah . 
  great stats . 
  you should go and say this same thing to mr. putin, 
  beautiful, 
  you know shit about living under the soviet shoe . 
  folowed through ?!, 
   you seem incredibly hung up on an image of putin as a crazed , unstable madman no , i 'm just genuinely confused and scared and i do all my best to believe everything will be allright . 
   if , for example , the polish government could get away with annexing a strategically interesting region without major backlash , then they would i beg to differ . 
  a lot . 
  i do n't think that the atmosphere and the sentiment of what 's going on is soon to die down even if there 's no war . 
  how 's russia actually profiting from this situation and this sentiment ? 
  i understand that you do n't expect the west to really do anything and let russia get away with it ? 
  because this is the only scenario with no major repercussions for russia . 
  in any other scenario , putin is just putting his country in a very bad position internationally . 
  ** this ** is what i call irrational and desperate . 
  i 'm not talking about a nuclear war , i 'm talking about how detrimental this behaviour is for russia itself - providing that the west will `` remember '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't think putin is an idiot , i think it is quite the opposite . 
  but if you think about such options as russia being left out of g8 , wto and other organizations , distancing ukraine more than it is necessary , personal visa bans for russian oligarchs , weakening of the ruble , asset freezes , investors pulling out , a perspective of the west getting off the russian gas addiction ( it is quite possible ) and last but not least - something that might seem rather impossible but more impossible things happened before in russia - russian people getting tired of his internal and foreign politics , well , with such options in mind , his actions might seem rather irrational , do n't you think ? 
  or there 's something much bigger going on , but i ca n't imagine what if nuke war is not an option for anyone . 
  but we never failed you, 
  every single thing he 's doing right now indicates he 's irrational . 
  there 's no single gain in international relations he 'll have from this . 
  no single gain in his relations with ukraine . 
  crimea , really is hardly a worthy piece of territorial gain , let 's be honest . 
  `` sabre rattling '' is such a general phrase . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he 's rattling to whom , in whose name and why ? 
  i mean , i almost ** feel ** paranoid and question myself when i look at the reactions of people in western europe . 
  maybe it 's not serious at all , this russian army on ukrainian territory ( autonomy or not ) ? 
  and by `` people '' i do n't mean the politicians , just regular people . 
  they just do n't care . 
  who gives a shit . 
  so maybe you can invade anyone as long as the gas flows to germany , italy and the rest of the club ? 
  but i do n't want to think you can . 
  i was taught to think it 's a serious thing when there 's a breach of international law - and there are unmarked soldiers at crimea disarming ukrainian troops . 
  i came to a conclusion that this situation is only for the internal `` putinist '' propaganda , to show that no dissent will be allowed . 
  but this is a desperate step if international relations have to be strained to make russians believe putin is in control . 
  but these thngs aside , you do believe tomorrow this will be over ? 
  i honestly hope so . 
  it 's not about who has bigger and better nukes . 
  a war can be smaller than that but still of terrible consequences . 
  they have practically annexed crimea already . 
  it 's not rattling anything . 
  it 's happening . 
  great it 's not happening in the netherlands . 
  i know polish people might seem paranoid about russia ( i 'm polish and for all i know beck is polish too ) , but please , see it guys , russia is not your `` pretty much like every country in the world '' . 
  it 's not , it just is n't . 
  even if the crimea business right now is just for the tzar to show to his subjects he 's a strong one - it means exactly the opposite . 
  if he needs this craziness to seem strong , looks like he 's desperate . 
  if desperate , then irrational - and this is when i get scared . 
  iran seems to be a more stable political partner than russia now . 
  yeah , well , watch them . 
  i really want to know now what 's up with the portuguese guy, 
  i am offended . 
  and disappointed . 
  and ` huh , didnt i tell you this would happen ? 
  she 's in denial , horrifying, 
  i agree with you . 
  i actually thought for a while , having a conspiracy theory moment , that juncker and de maiziere had that in mind while proposing such solutions . 
  you know , scaring the shit out of people with `` oh you gon na end up in terrible bulgaria or racist poland '' so that they just stop coming . 
  but no , it ca n't be true . 
  it 'd mean `` europe '' is hypocritical - and i do n't believe that . 
  the fence is keeping out refugees though . 
  apparently 10000 were already halted http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungarian-police-stop-nearly-10000-refugees-from-crossing-the-border-10501239.html whatever happens next , well see . 
  i think the humanitarian crisis will end when those people get the news that theyll be relocated to postcommunist countries without welfare and 10 % ( or more ) unemployment . 
  but we will see . 
  i 'll welcome and admire all those who will want to come here , to poland . 
  they 'll be the real heroes .
