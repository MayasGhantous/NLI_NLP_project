  we obey and will obey whatever laws and regulations there are that we agreed to . 
  but you ca n't make people unwilling to be here make stay here . 
  they 'll escape and break your and our laws and regulations . 
  nevermind though , time will show . 
  it 's actually going to be quite interesting . 
  that 's so sad that you guys think that if you obey laws and regulations , everybody will . 
  it 's very sad :(, 
   try to find someone in poland over 30 who believes in evolution what ? 
  where do you get your information from ? 
  are you suggesting that it is difficult ? 
  my mind is blown , such ignorance . 
  wow, 
  reddit vacation . 
  seriously, 
  honestly , take a break from reddit . 
  really . 
  itll do you good . 
  the less you comment the better you feel , believe me, 
  you oh too much, 
  we would like those people who moved to your country to come back and have a good life in poland . 
  many of them would like that too . 
  if they cant afford them lets take away any money they have left lol, 
  gems of my polish patria ... eh ... :( i feel sooooo inadequate not being a racist nazi or a leftist social justice warrior . 
  so much sadness , helplessness and hopelessness in me ... 
  i do n't understand anything anymore . 
  it 's just too perplexing . 
  i 'm just gon na go water my plants and play with the dogs because i just do n't see any sense in the news anymore . 
  it 's simply become too much nonsense, 
  nazi !, 
  and a racist, 
  good one, 
  which is nit open for pedestrians, 
  if not accepting quota will save v4 some money i dobt see why v4 should accept any quota . 
  simple, 
  capitalism , free market , but everybody should see to their business right ? 
  you are trying to tell us that negotiations and the whole process of praparations for a deal like this do not start well before announcing a big success ? 
  how dumb are you , honestly ? 
  oooooh raciiisssm boohooo i see this word losing its meaning soooooo quicklyyyy, 
  swedish people on reddit are the biggest and most outspoken hypocrites ever . 
  nobody can beat you, 
  i understand the show they make . 
  i understand that tough decisions are unpopular and that pr is important . 
  but those decisions have to be made . 
  otherwise anyone can do anything . 
  they should be detained and registered , by force if necessary . 
  law should n't care if they 're tired or frustrated or that they simply `` want '' something . 
  law is law . 
  okay , some forces then . 
  where are they then ? 
  how come they are not allowed to detain them . 
  those people have no right to walk in an organized group on a highway , that 's one thing . 
  do they have all the necessary documents to be where they are ? 
  should n't they , according to the law , be registered ? 
  did n't they run from the police ? 
  how are they supposed to know that in europe laws are to be obeyed if they come here and dictate their own laws and just do whatever they please ? 
  so in denmark uproar prevents following the law ? 
  and there will not be uproar when laws are broken and borders trespassed ? 
  i do not get it . 
  i 'm really , every day , being more and more shocked by the `` state of the union '' , union that i admired so much . 
  maybe blindly if somebody breaks a law in denmark , is it enough to say youre traumatized to avoid punishment ? 
  she will oppose the quota , but she will accept a very high number of people to show `` solidarity '' . 
  in exchange of that she 'll try to bargain for some sovereignty in selection of whom we take in ( which is not that uttlerly stupid ) . 
  then po will lose the election like nobody ever lost before and i think po will cease to exist , itll simply dismantle . 
  she 's losing all her voters that i personally know , and i mostly have known po voters . 
  another til  thanks !, 
  but ... why do you read hitler ? 
   60 % of the people are refugees from east prussia til , thank you, 
  but i thought there were laws for that, 
  you are mostly refugees in germany ? 
  thats the first time ... 
  so it only means that the danish police is helpless or do not intend to act . 
  it 's bit disappointing but , well , i guess it is okay . 
  i 'm not poland . 
  and i do n't know a person called poland . 
  what i 'm trying to do here is to have a logical discussion detatched from emotions . 
  but apparently it 's impossible , because i 'm brought back to my right place ... and i should probably take off my flair because i 'm getting a lot of `` you racit polish people '' , `` you greedy eastern europeans '' . 
  the facts are : immigrants do n't want to come here , refugee camps in poland offer terrible terrible abominable conditions of living and no opportunity to integrate . 
  and if you want me to represent my flair country and talk about `` human emotions and duties towards suffering and poverty '' then i can say this : i dont want to be ashamed of my country after people start running away from here ( and it will happen ) , after there are riots in refugee camps , i dont want to be the bad man of europe who does n't provide enough care for the poeple in need - because he ca n't afford it . 
  i do n't want to take responsibility that i know my country can not handle without getting prepared and ready . 
  i , a polish person , can not honestly say that i can right now provide for the people who are in need . 
  not without proper process of preparation and bettering myself and my country . 
  and this is what people closest to me think . 
  i ca n't speak for those whom i do n't know personally . 
  so if you want to discuss with me , discuss with me , not some people i do not know and can not speak for . 
  what does it have to do with the current situation ? 
  if you want to guilt trip a bit you 're barking up the wrong tree . 
  im not in a charitable mood nor do i feel especially grateful towards our western neighbors . 
  if you want to start the guilt-focused exchange of opinions , i assure you that i will win and you 'll go cry in the corner and will never want to guilttrip anyone from the east again . 
  i can actually guilt trip you to hell, 
  even if the police has no capacity to deal with a problem ? 
  i 'm not sure how it works in my own country , but i know that the army steps in in the times of crises ( however , i only saw them help in cases of floods and snow storms ) . 
  plus i thought that army gets useful when borders are trespassed by illegals but maybe it in fact works differently in various countries . 
  i 'll explain : ** fair ** - it would be fair if the quota actually represented reality ; they do n't , they are based on ** selected ** statistics and selected statistics tend to be used to serve an agenda and can be interpreted in many ways ; so quota based on statistics are not fair for the countries that can not accept responsibly to take the burden of providing for people in need ** fair ** - it would be fair if all the migrants could be given same chances at the start and could more or less choose where they will be allocated - but they wont be given the same chances if some of them end up in germany , some in poland , some in bulgaria ; so that 's not fair ** distribution ** - how is this going to be implemented and executed ; right now greek , hungrian , italian , danish and german police can not cope with the problem nor can they do anything to force those people to respect the laws of the countries whose borders they trespassed ; how will those migrants be redistributed to other countries ** in practice ** - by force ? 
  will they be incarcerated or detained in camps guarded by army ? 
  in my opinion it 's hypocritical to invite people over to one country and then send them to other countries where they do n't want to be . 
  and it 's inhumane to send them there by force . 
  hence my comparison to sacks of potatoes . 
  people are not potatoes . 
  ** distributing potatoes is much easier done than distributing people . 
  ** let 's please not be hypocrites , lets be realistic and not call the distribution fair .
