  refrain from the use of nuclear arms against ukraine . 
  consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments . 
  because russia has broken all of the non-nuclear ones , and violated # 3 * long * before maidan . 
  budapest was broken when russia 's puppet regime was overthrown ? 
  please . 
  unlike in crimea , where under military occupation parliament was dissolved and a man who took less than 5 % of the previous vote was put in charge , with yanukovych it was done according to the constitution . 
  he was impeached , including by members of his own party , and the second in line according to law took over . 
  elections were called for , and given ample time to prepare . 
  or should have any say whatsoever in what neighboring countries buy and from who, 
  well , they 've been getting closer to turkey recently , especially with turkey 's frustration with the lack of progress with eu integration . 
  their continued oppression of tatars in the crimea should have turned turkey off to warming relations with russia , but so far that has n't happened . 
  you must not know any ukrainians or tatars , then . 
  yeah , they totally misspelled `` tourists '', 
  meh , i 've gone through agencies . 
  you do get the ease that the flight is chartered , hotels and transportation are prepared , as well as any tours/sightseeing . 
  it 's also all handled in your native language , and you have representatives helping you out . 
  the solid agencies have financial backing and years of experience . 
  the newer ones are the ones that fail , that offer bottom of the barrel prices , and have nothing to fall back on . 
  chill , the gas is probably just on vacation . 
  i do n't recall annexations , champ . 
  plus , if you want to play history , why limit yourself to 100 years ? 
  the ukrainian identity has existed much longer , despite what russia claims . 
  furthermore , the east slavs themselves came out of kiev . 
  if you want to go back far enough , moscow should turn itself over to kiev . 
  but then again , that 's ridiculous , right ? 
  so why not at least keep these current parties beholden to the agreements they 've signed in recent memory . 
  like russia accepting ukraine 's borders as they were , before invasion ? 
  or does russia just get free reign to do whatever they want , whenever they want , because whataboutism ? 
  sure you can . 
  russia and the united states are not peers , let alone russia and nato . 
  russia is an autocratic petro-state with an economy the size of italy 's . 
  i understand their frustration , and their want to punch above their weight in international relations , but they have no justification to do so . 
  crimea is more complex ? 
  no , it 's very simple . 
  russia invaded , occupied , and annexed part of their neighbor . 
  remind me when nato did that last . 
  `` creeping of nato '' . 
  russia has no claim of dominion over their former satellite states , and if they want to join the west , the eu , and nato , they have every right to do so . 
  or at least they should , without fear of military intervention from their former overlords . 
  they 're sourcing [ zvezda tv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvezda_%28tv_channel%29 ), 
  some certainly do . 
  but not all have recently invaded , occupied and annexed parts of their neighbors . 
  you should avoid fox , too . 
  if you want to see the effects , just check out the comments to the `` articles '' at [ fox nation ] ( http://nation.foxnews.com/ ), 
  time for full nato membership , 
  they 've been wanting to for the longest time ? 
  but the west prevented them ? 
  what about the years of voting that said they did n't ? 
  prior to the `` independence '' vote held under military occupation of course , where the status quo was n't one of the options ? 
  you guys are n't even trying any more . 
  recently ? 
  heat ? 
  are you even being serious ? 
  the bbc then asked what it said was a group of russian journalists in the area about the story . 
  `` she [ the 10-year-old shelling victim ] does n't exist , '' one tells the bbc journalist , adding that they `` had to broadcast [ the story ] , '' without elaborating . 
  yeah , of all of the different angles , that 's the hardest one for me to complain about . 
  mom 's doing a good job balancing being the de-facto leader of europe , and kicking russia every so often without provoking them too bad . 
  the sanctions are in response to russian intervention in east ukraine , though . 
  yes , but the comments from people not reading the article are a fantastic insight into various mindsets . 
  that wo n't happen . 
  they wo n't abandon the sanctions . 
  it 's just one analysts opinion , and it 's because the countries in question are mostly economically dependent on russia , or in shitty economic positions . 
   well , hitler was right about danzig . 
  that 's * literally * the first thing he wrote . 
  and during those times , poles were also there . 
  150 years after the teutonic knights took the city , it went * back * into polish hands . 
  but , yeah , good work trying to support hitler 's ideas . 
  are you trolling or do you not see a difference between celts in milan and poles in gdansk ? 
  see : article , or my comment in this post re : that . 
  [ nope . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_gda%c5%84sk )  gda\u0144sk is one of oldest cities in poland . 
  founded by the polish ruler mieszko i in the 10th century , the city was for a long time part of piast state either directly or as a fief . 
  before you whine that it 's euromaidanpress , they address your concerns :  note . 
  everything we publish in the section the naked truth is dead serious and , unlike our usual propaganda and lies , true . 
  it should be taken literally . 
  video showing comparison of two speeches on shuster live tv show subtitled by voices of ukraine . 
  not my losses, 
  it 's just under occupation, 
  it * is * ukraine, 
  that was point one , 
  not according to the ecj ... 
  also , each night costs more than the last on account of the imploding economy . 
  what you just said confirms eu legal supremacy . 
  accept it or leave the union . 
   depending on the constitutional tradition of member states , different solutions have been developed to adapt questions of incompatibility between national law and eu law to one another . 
  union law is accepted as having supremacy over the law of member states , but not all member states share the ecj 's analysis of why eu law takes precedence over national law when there is a conflict . 
  just like us states may complain about federal supremacy , it does n't change the fact that federal law supersedes . 
  [ of course it does ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supremacy_%28european_union_law%29 ) . 
  the countries can argue otherwise , but that 's the idea of the eu . 
  oh , i dunno  i imagine there is though , or that it would simply fall under freedom of speech protections . 
  because romania is part of the european union , and european union law supersedes national law ... 
  i 'd imagine eu law would nullify that anyway ? 
  [ what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitchens%27s_razor ) . 
  and regardless , it 's all in ukraine . 
  similar laws to russia would n't exactly be a shocker . 
  do n't forget the eu separatism growing throughout the union, 
  what other countries ? 
  [ hurr durr ] ( http://i.imgur.com/idyevdg.gif ) , if it 's not kremlin-funded , it 's propaganda, 
  it 's a great place , but i 'll be moving out into the countryside soon enough . 
  traffic and pollution are terrible .
