barroso was never the brightest light in the sky , i honestly do n't know what you expect . 
  though i have to say with this ebola story one can surely win a lot of hearts . 
  i hope you are not seriously trying to prove anything with this story . 
  the same would have happened if it was written by any other leader in the eu . 
  and the article explains why that is ... 
  wow , this is so wrong . 
  several countries besides the uk were affect by the adjustment , too . 
  playing the victim card here is absolutely not warranted . 
  and the elections were particularly funny , because the uk establishment , who always scream about the democratic deficit , decided to not participate in the spitzenkandidaten concept and was trying to block the democratic evolution of the parliament . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  it sounds strange to me , but i guess it 's just because i am not used to it . 
  what , how is that even possible ? 
  what happens to these `` extra '' years ? 
  they are not `` secret '' if the public has a reasonable interest in knowing the name , and no , there 's no general rule to determine if this is the case or not . 
  how is that sentences `` ridiculously low '' o_o . 
  10 years is quite some time . 
  first the various verfassungsschutz are doing their best to mislead the police so that the nsu trio could not be captured which let to them continuing to commit acts of terrorism left an right and now the bnd is doing this for years on `` accident '' too . 
  something 's totally not fishy with our intelligent services . 
  * i actually have thought about this more than once , too . 
  with increasing european , integration that would be a logical step . 
  europe of regions comes to mind . 
  however , as others have pointed out , the federal system is not loved very much in germany , as it tends to not really account for regional differences , but instead seems to raise unnecessary barriers between the different l\u00e4nder . 
  it seems to foster corruption too . 
  in my bundesland , baden-w\u00fcrttemberg this became apparent very much after the cdu was not elected to be the ruling party for the first time in almost 60 ( ! ), 
  years however , i often ask myself if that 's not partially our , the voters , fault . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's true for every corner of germany , but a lot of people here do not really keep attention of what 's going on on the land level , but are more interested in the federal politics , if at all . 
  so without people keeping a close eye on what 's going on it 's easy for things to go out of hand . 
  of course one can not attribute it entirely to the voters , but i think if we 'd care more it would n't be as bad as it is . 
  another think that always bothered me is that the concept of subsidiary has been given great attention on the federal level , with the l\u00e4nder getting more legislative power over the years , but on the l\u00e4nder level this is basically unheard of . 
  if anything , the cities and counties have gotten a greater burden but less resources to handle it over the years . 
  so if nothing were to change then i 'd definitely be against giving the l\u00e4nder more power in a eu setting . 
  tl ; dr i am undecided . 
  yeah , refugees from syria , irak etc. 
  are totally not running away from war or persecution / s, 
  this is not about immigration , but about asylum seekers . 
   no surprise for germany  g\u00fcnther oettinger , the incumbent energy commissioner , will get the trade portfolio in the next eu executive , according to the organigram , as germany wanted . 
  this means that oettinger would also become chief negotiator for the controversial transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) . 
  may the lord have mercy . 
  maybe we have enough luck and the american side will not understand what he wants from us , [ after all everything hangs together and we 're all sitting in one boat .

  the '' [ staatsinstitut f\u00fcr familienforschung ] ( http://www.ifb.bayern.de/index.html ) an der [ universit\u00e4t bamberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_bamberg ) ( ifb ) '' [ ~ state institute for family research at the university of bamberg ( ifb ) ] ( a bavarian institution ) [ have carried out a study ] ( http://www.bmjv.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/pdfs/forschungsbericht_die_lebenssituation_von_kindern_in_gleichgeschlechtlichen_lebenspartnerschaften.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) on this topic for the german ministry of justice . 
  they did not find any significant differences between children growing up in traditional and same sex families . 
  and the bing translator version , because i 'm lazy :p ( lp stands for same-sex families )  the results show that children and young people from lp on the quality of relationships with both parents and in their psychological adaptation little differ from children and young people who grow up on in other forms of family . 
  the same applies to conflicts between the partners in the lp , as well as for clashes with the external parent . 
  accordingly , significant differences were that children and young people from lp reported a higher self-esteem and greater autonomy in the relationship with both parents than peers in other forms of family . 
  in the synopsis , the children study results suggest that children and young people in rainbow families as well develop as children in other family forms . 
  regardless of the form of the family very much similar influence factors . 
  the structure of the family , but the quality of innerfamilialen relations is crucial to the development of children . 
  for the considered development dimensions of children and adolescents , it was thus as not important , whether you are a lone parent , two mothers or fathers or father and mother grow up on , but how is the quality of the relationships in these families . 
  also important to note : the study finds that a majority of the children have n't had experienced discrimination at the point the study was carried out ( 63 % of the parents reported that their children had n't experienced discrimination , 53 % of the children reported the same ) [ section 4 , point 4 ] . 
  the only thing i could find is article 7 in the treaty on european union :  ** article 7 **  1 . 
  on a reasoned proposal by one third of the member states , by the european parliament or by the european commission , the council , acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 . 
  before making such a determination , the council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations to it , acting in accordance with the same procedure . 
  the council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply . 
  the european council , acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the european commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made , the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . 
  in doing so , the council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons . 
   the obligations of the member state in question under the treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that state . 
  the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed . 
  the voting arrangements applying to the european parliament , the european council and the council for the purposes of this article are laid down in article 354of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  the referenced article 2 of the treaty on european union :  ** article 2 **  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . 
  for those who 'd like to know how the procedure would look like :  ** article 354 **  for the purposes of article 7 of the treaty on european union on the suspension of certain rights resulting from union membership , the member of the european council or of the council representing the member state in question shall not take part in the vote and the member state in question shall not be counted in the calculation of the one third or four fifths of member states referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of that article . 
  abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of decisions referred to in paragraph 2 of that article . 
   for the adoption of the decisions referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 7 of the treaty on european union , a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with article 238 ( 3 ) ( b ) of this treaty . 
   where , following a decision to suspend voting rights adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 7 of the treaty on european union , the council acts by a qualified majority on the basis of a provision of the treaties , that qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with article 238 ( 3 ) ( b ) of this treaty , or , where the council acts on a proposal from the commission or from the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , in accordance with article 238 ( 3 ) ( a ) . 
   for the purposes of article 7 of the treaty on european union , the european parliament shall act by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast , representing the majority of its component members . 
  so that 's quite ambiguous and it does n't really seem like the commission has much power here any way . 
  but maybe somewhere else there 's stated if and what the commission alone can do . 
  oh that 's an interesting provision to the treaties . 
  could you point me to the article ( s ) in the treaties ? 
  my god the comments are horrible : <, 
  germany : ** state ** * mandate consociationalism in the constitution * remove all references to god from the constitution * enrich multiculturalism as national objectives in the constitution * use schulze ( stv ) as the election method of choice * change the german anthem to something that does n't sound like a funeral after 7 weeks of constant rain * dismantle the verfassungsschutz ** politics ** * ban the csu along with the afd * introduce progressive fines * a federal program to move to open source software instead of each government institution doing their own thing * enact a whistle-blower protection law * equal right for all * remove all gendered laws * either remove drafting from law entirely or make it gender agnostic * lift the ban on incest * civil unions/marriages should not be gender or number specific * parents are not allowed to let someone perform irreversible body modifications on their children , unless there a medical indication to do so * introduce anonymised applications instead of quotas * ... ** education ** * make ethics/philosophy available from year 1 * make islamic religious education available in all schools * drop religious education after year 6 entirely -- going on with ethics and philosophy * make turkish as language choice in school widely available * introduce a central body that manages university enrolment * model the system more like finland 's * raise the requirements to become a teacher * make it a dedicated subject from early on with competent teachers * make gsm acceptance as important as fighting racism * ... ** healthcare ** * nationalise healthcare * demand the pharmaceutical industry to make all their studies available to the public * a central body for purchasing medical equipment and drugs * fund campaigns to de-stigmatise mental health problems * ... ** religion ** * let church membership expire after 5 years if not wished otherwise * fund islamic theology programs more * create a central body that regulates and oversees religious matters/employs all the pastors , imams , etc. 
  * ... ** digital agenda ** * break up the big isps/telcos * enrich net-neutrality in the constitution * ban warrant less surveillance * revoke the bestandsdatenausfkunft * remove the gema-vermutung * send all the gema , vg wort , ... employees as spies to north korea . 
  * ... ** energy ** * break-up of the 4 big utility companies into smaller entities * heavily invest ptg facilities . 
  the more of those energy exports land in our gas grid the better * decentralise the energy grid more * invest more in gas plants , do n't shut down nuclear plants unless necessary . 
  reducing the use of coal should be top priority * heavily promote and subsidise the modernisation of the housing stock -- new houses should be energy-plus-houses * ... i could go on ... so much to fix : s, 
  i do n't get it either . 
  but the internet is full of them . 
  just a few days ago i saw people celebrating that rt wants to expand to germany , `` finally some neutral news and not the western state propaganda '' o_o . 
  you used that wrong :'(, 
  they can make use of this power , but it wo n't make this power any more meaningful . 
  fair enough . 
  i agree , that 's why i did n't vote for him . 
  the process can be changed just fine . 
  my point is that they deliberately ignored information that was widely available and widely discussed . 
  it 's not different to people voting for the same guy every election and then rant about `` nothing ever changes '' . 
  what would you change in the process of getting information to the people , when the way of using mass media ( tv debates , articles in every big newspaper etc. ), 
  does fail this ? 
  when people deliberately do n't want to be informed you ca n't shift the blame to those who try to inform them . 
  the only alternative is to not inform them at all . 
  of course they are at fault when they do n't gather information in such an important process . 
  hypocrisy only because it comes from the voting base is not excusable . 
  thanks . 
  that 's disheartening . 
  but still i 'd say that 's the fault of the voters , not the media . 
  there was no newspaper or tv station here with no talk about the eu candidates . 
  which makes it even more sad . 
  can you back that claim up ? 
  at least in germany it was pretty huge .
