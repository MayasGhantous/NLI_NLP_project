  so many opted-out of streetview that the service is n't available at all in my city . 
  kashubia 's , apparently . 
  baw\u00fc 's has a slightly [ darker ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg.svg ) hue . 
  thank you !, 
  shameless copying is the best , haha :d * cough * w\u00fcrttemberg stronk !, 
  * cough *, 
  yeah , though i think the yellow is a bit off . 
  for a moment i thought a `` real '' baw\u00fc flag was available , but the way you 've solved this issue is quite creative too . 
  lol, 
  seconded in my eyes it 's one of the most beautiful flags there is , and i usually do n't even like `` cold '' colours . 
  huh ? 
  was n't germany trying to water everything down as much as possible , too ? 
  at least nobody can say that we could n't have expected that when we voted her in again . 
   that 's fascinating . 
  i wonder if this coming generation is the one that will stop associate themselves with sides of ww2 . 
  is this the common in rest europe ? 
  because i never associated with any side when learning about wwii ( or any war respectively ) . 
  to me it 's a really `` weird '' way of thinking to associate oneself with a side in a conflict one had nothing to do with . 
  what i 've taken from history classes is that war always is one big injustice in itself . 
  i thought this was rather common . 
  well since ` civilised ' is a relative term one can find ( in their view ) uncivilised practices in any civilisation . 
  nope never happened . 
  bavaria must suck : \u00fe seriously though : the only thing i can remember is that on the next day neighbours asked in a very passive-aggressive way what was going on . 
   if german women do n't work , why do they have so few kids ? 
  nobody likes these annoying noise monsters around all day : \u00fe  also , do people really ca n't do any noisy housework on sundays ? 
  even during the day ? 
  in france it 's typically on sundays that people do diy work , drill walls and stuff like that . 
  maybe it 's not as common for germans to work on their house themselves , especially since so many of them rent . 
  in france , everyone basically buys their place whenever they can , and work on it themselves to save money . 
  i 've never heard anyone complaining about it , but it really is a rather rare thing to do here ( south west ) and considered a bit rude . 
  also i 've never ever heard anyone call a working mother a `` rabenmutter '' here ( south west ) . 
  though even for most germans south = = bavaria, 
  how sad, 
  i remember buying `` lakritzschnecken '' in a sweet variant , but ever since i could only get my hands on the salty version . 
  such is life , eternal sufferings : < ;d, 
   since someone mentioned it , liquorice is known in the south ( austria , northern italy , france , switzerland ) , but mostly sweet , not salty . 
  i do n't like either of them . 
  they only sell the gross salty stuff here :'(, 
  so all the non han-chinese in china are n't chinese ? 
  not to speak of all the people in the republic china who are n't han-chinese . 
  by the same logic there were several german ethnicities prior to 1871 , which then suddenly disappeared after the german empire was founded . 
  ethnicity is n't the same thing as nationality . 
  i do , even though only with quark on top , 
  haha , i said it before and i say it again : that actually makes her likeable in my eyes , 
  i guess / u/karlchen is refering to this law : * http://dejure.org/gesetze/bgb/1631d.html a reaction to this ruling : * http://openjur.de/u/429887.html, 
  it 's about the dispute where europe ends , i guess . 
  the german speaking world seems to see it differently than e.g. 
  the english speaking world . 
  at least that 's what the german wikipedia told me . 
  and the english wikipedia says :  the generally accepted highest summit is mount elbrus ( 5,642 m or 18,510 ft ) in the caucasus , appearing on both the bass and messner lists . 
  however , because the location of the boundary between asia and europe is not universally agreed upon , its inclusion in europe is disputed : if the kuma -- manych depression is used as geological border between asia and europe , caucasus and elbrus lie wholly in asia . 
  if the greater caucasus watershed is used instead , elbrus ' peaks are wholly in europe , albeit close to the border with asia . 
  mont blanc ( 4,810 m or 15,781 ft ) , lying on the border between france and italy in the graian alps , is seen by some to be the highest mountain in europe . 
   seven summits your point is ? 
  german schools teach that mont blanc is europe 's highest mountain though . 
  which still is a minority :p, 
  like / u/chaosdada said it 's dark blue , light blue and burgundy . 
  at least it 's more difficult to ban a party today than it was in the times of the weimar republic . 
  the second one might have been me : * http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lgdfq/what_is_are_your_favorite_european_languages_why/cbz5sl7, 
  while comparing it to speaking is a bad example : what about maths ? 
  why should n't pupils be able to opt-out of mathematics ? 
  the swimming class is n't about having fun . 
  pupils who ca n't swim learn to swim in these classes , and also how to rescue themselves and others if no life guard is around . 
  i do n't really see how that 's an problem . 
  it 's like someone would argue they 'd rather not take part in the mandatory first-aid-class before obtaining their driver license , because the really rather do something else . 
  i never had segregated pe classes and it was just fine , 
  ~ ~ so instead of linking the credible source you went on and linked the less if not least credible one . ~ ~ edit : misread your statement, 
  well you could have come up with something credible in first place , 
   p.s. 
  completely state owned healthcare system is even more barbaric . 
  nhs is constantly rocked by scandals like : http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/13968-uk-euthanasia-expands-from-elderly-to-infants[1] http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/11796-doctor-british-health-service-euthanizes-130000-patients-a-year[2] lol . 
  the credibility of this `` news site '' can easily be judge by simply looking at these two stories : * http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/16477-eu-exploring-scheme-to-install-speed-limiting-de * http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/16441-armed-german-police-abduct-four-homeschooled-kidsvices-on-cars have a laugh !, 
   the spd/gr \u00fcne are simply laughable and no real competition . 
  the spd politicans start singing in the bundestag , are you freaking kidding me ? 
  i have heard worse from other politicians . 
   any other vote for a smaller party is probably lost , since they have no political weight at all . 
   germany is one of the wealthiest and most stable countries in the world , our politicans are the envy of many other countries citizens , but you seem to fall for the naysayers , that only complain and never really offer solutions . 
  i doubt that there are many . 
  we had an fdp mep at our school ... well i would n't trust a government party that answers the question about battling poverty and inequity with `` what do you care ? 
  you live in one of the richest areas of germany with a low unemployment rate . '', 
  well , that sounds like a good plan , does n't it ? 
   it is easy to be in the opposition and promise everything the people want to hear and say that the goverment did ` nt get their agenda done . 
  but guess what , doing that while being the reason the goverment ca n't work , because you stop anything the goverment is trying to do in the bundesrat is simply shameful and completly unbecoming of a political exchange between adults . 
  that 's politics . 
  just like the cdu/csu did want to stop the agenda 2010 if the red-green government was also to introduce minimum wages . 
  it 's kind of a really odd understanding how politics should work if you demand everyone to approve everything even though they disapprove of it . 
  on the other hand the government parties often do n't want to work at all when it comes to laws that might not be in their favour ( one can only guess why ) : http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/schaerfere_regeln_gegen_abgeordnetenbestechung-605-525.html http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/offenlegung_von_nebeneinkuenften_auf_euro_und_cent-605-472.html that are in favour of some lobby groups while harming especially small start-ups : http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/leistungsschutzrecht-605-500.html that would make a difference for some people but do n't harm anyone , other than maybe the world view of some religious nut jobs ( besides if you have watched some talk of politicians about this topic you could have seen what 's worse than singing in the bundestag ) : http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/recht_auf_eheschliessung_fuer_gleichgeschlechtliche_paare-605-434.html or when they decide last minute to implement a law after two years time , read : being lazy http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/reform_des_bundestagswahlrechts-605-392.html great work guys !, 
  those coins have a wonderful design !, 
  yes , thanks , 
  you do n't seem to have a problem to elevate english at the expense of other european languages though . 
  the only thing he forces you to is to search for the english part for a split second . 
  if you do n't want french to get an elevated status over other languages then maybe you should invest the same amount of work as him and post in a second language too !, 
  i do n't feel like that 's more offensive though . 
  maybe it 's just me . 
  while i can certainly empathise with you ( i have been in the same situation before ) , i do not think that this situation is comparable . 
  it 's not like bilingual comments exclude anyone . 
  english translation is there too and if you * really * care there 's always the `` original '' comment to check with a translation service . 
  it 's understandable , i often have the same feeling , but in the end also completely irrational . 
  the outrage and the personal attacks on / u/dclauzel are completely blown out of proportion imo .
