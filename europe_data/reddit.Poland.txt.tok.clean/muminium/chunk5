  some people here seem to have ... issues . 
  \u2191 finally someone said it !, 
  i think i would want kids . 
  but i was let down by my parents very much , and i am not sure if i could be a better parent than they were . 
  so i am rather undecided . 
  a long time now , 
  they are dickheads ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba ), 
  i have seen one exploding before . 
  so i definitely would n't say it never happens . 
  i honestly doubt that . 
  i mean cat is fine , but it still requires a person to correct what the computer gives them . 
  certain things simply do not need translation , but interpretation and machines are not very good at that . 
  if such a thing , that could cut out humans completely , really exists i wonder why it 's not commercially available considering that the inventor of such software would probably be a billion dollar company by now . 
  i hope these are better than what 's available to the public . 
  i have yet to see a computer translation of a german text i can make sense of . 
  and that 's odd considering how relatively close german and english are . 
  yep that 's correct . 
  should be the plural instead , 
  nope , the quota demands at least 30 % men/women on the boards . 
  it 's gender neutral in this regard . 
   sorry but this is mostly bullshit . 
  europeans were never warming up against turks . 
  we were always the muslims who invaded half of europe . 
  maybe you ca n't recall the times before erdogan , but i can and it was the same , nothing changed , it 's not a coincidence that turkey did n't get into eu ** and even all measures were accomplished ** we still would n't so stop chasing a dream and move on . 
  turkey should implement the good and advantageous laws but not with the goal to join , the goal should be the progress and improvement . 
  but [ turkey never did and still does not fullfill all the requirements for an accession . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) other than that i agree with you . 
  the eu has n't absorbed another country that big ever since the uk joined . 
  and that was in the 70s . 
  turkey joining would really alter the power structure within the eu . 
  personally i would not support a membership until turkey has resolved their issues with their eu neighbors ( greece and cyprus ) and it adopts the full aquis . 
  however , i think that we should push for turkeys membership even only to stabilize its democracy as has been the case with the eastern european countries . 
  is there one for women too ? 
  sure thing nazi-apologist , that makes it true of course . 
  fair enough . 
  i guess we have to agree to disagree . 
  because , the police demented the claim of [ such huge under-reportet numbers multible times . 
  ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/die-uebergriffe-in-koeln-und-falsche-zahlen-von-der-wiesn-14004617.html ) also if you read any witness accounts from cologne you 'd see that it 's not the same as what had happened in cologne . 
  where men ripped off the pants of women who were travelling in groups and were nearby police officers . 
  that does n't make what happens on the oktoberfest any less deplorable though . 
  i said , the amounts of offences would outnumber the rape of nanking , not the offences were the same . 
  but ok , i guess reading is n't your strength . 
  and yes , some ~ 400,000 + offences would have to be expected on the oktoberfest every year to reach the same ratio of attendance to offences as in cologne . 
   i was calling b.s. 
  on a poster that said white men never do anything like what happened in cologne . 
  no they did not say that . 
  they did say that it never happened on such a scale in such an open manner . 
  the complete disrespect of authority was unlike anything seen before in post-war germany . 
  the way it went down in cologne would mean that , if it were to happen like this in every other context like you claimed , that there would be no situation in which people would be safe . 
  not being in watched public paces , not travelling in groups , not standing near police officers , not calling out for help , not fighting in groups . 
   just because women do n't bother reporting it does n't mean it 's a completely incomparable situation , it just means when it happens in the context of oktoberfest ( ** and only white men do it ** ) it is culturally acceptable . 
  we do not know that . 
  and it is not culturally acceptable , otherwise there would n't be numerous prevention strategies in place , which sadly are not able to prevent everything , but at least they prevent anything like what went down in cologne . 
  and secondly if it was comparable to what happens on the oktoberfest every year , this fast would cease existing in a matter of moments , because it would mean rape of nanking levels of sexual assault ** every year ** . 
  and no , that ca n't be explained away with `` not bothering to report '' it . 
  rape and sexual assault is disgusting no matter who does it or in which context , but trying to compare what happened in cologne to what happens on the oktoberfest is like comparing the bombardment of dresden to all war crimes of germany . 
  completely tactless and showing a lack of historical and cultural knowledge . 
   1700 people half looking for a fight vs 1000 people letting off fireworks at each other , pick pocketing and sexual assault . 
   why was one group stopped and painted with the same brush , and the other not ? 
  not a leading question at all . 
  because the police were idiots that night ? 
  i think that has been established . 
  you are like people whining why they are not allowed to knife other down only because the police was so incompetent to allow it at one accoation . 
  no , nobody said it 's ok . nice strawman . 
  however , the scope is entirely uncomparable . 
  it 's like the mother of all excuses `` oh , that always happens ! '', 
  when in fact it does not . 
  she scope , the cheekiness it completely uncomparable . 
  it 's like comparing a gang related hitman and mass murder . 
  well at both events people die , so it 's ok !, 
  what bigotted media to report on mass murder but not on hitman !, 
  i linked an article with all the information . 
   police knew a somewhat large number of people would be out for a pegida protest . 
  watercannons and large police formations were prepared , force was used . 
  after they started to throw bottles and firework at police and journalist . 
  which resulted in people getting injured . 
  what terrible injustice to break up the demonstration !, 
   how on earth can these thoughts not cross your mind ? 
  because he has an agenda to follow . 
  reason and facts do not fit into that . 
  just look at all the down votes for the article i linked to . 
  the propaganda on this sub is ridicules !, 
  well judge for yourself , here 's my dirty translation :  the police in cologne broke up a pegida protest after attacks with fireworks and bottles . 
  initially the protest had been blocked by opponents of the right wingers . 
  the lately heavily criticised police managed to to separate both sites elegantly . 
   the police in cologne broke up a pegida protest early . 
  before that supporters of the right wing association covered themselves up , showed the nazi salute and attacked police and media representatives with fireworks and bottles . 
  the police reacted with the use of water canons . 
  the demonstration with the motto `` pegida protects ! '', 
  was a reaction to the mass assaults on woman on new year 's eve . 
   after they managed to get only as far as about 300 metres , the pegida-supporters have been pushed back towards the main station . 
  there , security personal of deutsche bahn had been posted in front of key entrances - apparently out of concern of the riots moving into the main station . 
  after the break up of the demonstration the supporters have been accompanied to their trains in small groups . 
   a police spokeswoman said that one journalist had been injured at the violent excesses . 
  eye witnesses reported more injured , who had , among other things , suffered cuts in their facial area . 
  several have been arrested . 
   numerous counter protesters had originally blocked the original start of the pegida demonstration , after which the police escorted the supporters of the right-wing alliance round the main station to their planned demonstration route . 
  shortly after they broke up the demonstration after it came to violent excesses . 
   the counter protesters had long held out at the main station , but eventually left to start their own protest march . 
  the counter protest stayed mostly peaceful until the early afternoon , even though there had been members of the left-wing black block scene among them .
