   the anti-pegida protesters had cleared the the square in front of the main station in coordination with the police forces only a few minutes before the right-wingers returned to the main station . 
  other than initially planned the closing-speech of the counter-protesters was moved to the hans-b\u00f6ckler-platz to the west . 
  thus it seems that the , after the new year 's eve heavily criticised , cologne police seems to have separated the two sides elegantly . 
   according to police sources there have been known hooligans among the pegida-protesters . 
  about 450 of the by pegida nrw registered protest had arrived by train from the ruhr area and have been escorted by police forces . 
  police officers described the mood as `` very heated '' . 
   according to the police there have been about 1700 pegida protesters , of which about half had been looking for a fight . 
  just as many state police officers as well as several hundred federal police officers stood against them . 
  the police estimated the amount of counter protesters up to about 1300 . 
   the pegida-protesters were greeted by angry rallying-cries . 
  protesters of the left-wing spectrum shouted `` nazis out !, 
  '' , `` there 's no right to nazi-propaganda '' and `` we 'll get all of you . '', 
   woman protesters held up banner with slogans such as `` no means no . 
  that 's our law . 
  keep away from us '' or `` no to violence against woman , not in cologne , at the oktoberfest or in the bedroom . '', 
   after the escalations several hundred woman gathered at the main station to protest against violent attacks . 
  women 's groups called for thr flashmob on the internet . 
  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  but that kind of raises a question , does n't it : where were these crowd-controlling water cannons on new years , eh ? 
  are they just for use on nazi-style groups ? 
  nice leading question . 
  how come you think that they were peaceful ? 
  [ this article speaks of them [ probably hogesa ] throwing fireworks and bottles at the police forces . 
  [ such peaceful , wow !, 
  oh please , those are the textbook example of nazis . 
  hogesa called for the event too , and just last year they vandalized the city when they were `` protesting '' against salafists . 
  well their kind of `` protest '' obviously means setting things afire , throwing bottles and smashing show windows . 
  i am really worried that people will look down on germany for dealing with them / s, 
   well , apparently it happens every year in germany at octoberfest . 
  [ 1 ] [ using the oktoberfest is a silly , silly argument ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/die-uebergriffe-in-koeln-und-falsche-zahlen-von-der-wiesn-14004617.html ) tl ; dr 5.6 million attended the oktoberfest , compared to 1000 people having been in front of the main station in cologne . 
  400 \\* 0,4 = 160\u00a0160/1000 = 0,16 5,600,000 \\* 0,16 = ** 896000 ** that 's the amount of reports that should have been reported on the oktoberfest to reach the same ratio as the events in cologne . 
  so no , this does not usually happen and it should not . 
  i do n't like the right wing idiots either , but using the oktoberfest to try to qualify the events is really , really stupid . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_of_the_european_union] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_of_the_european_union ), 
  it would be very stupid of the eu to let the uk access the single market without complying with its regulations . 
  please quote the whole context and not selectivly . 
   in an interview in a brexit-themed issue of german weekly der spiegel , the influential veteran politician ruled out the possibility of the uk following a swiss or norwegian model that would allow it to enjoy the benefits of the single market without being an eu member . 
   `` that wo n't work , '' sch\u00e4uble told der spiegel . 
  `` it would require the country to abide by the rules of a club from which it currently wants to withdraw . 
  if the majority in britain opts for brexit , that would be a decision against the single market . 
  in is in . 
  out is out . 
  one has to respect the sovereignty of the british people . '', 
  that 's because the initiative has not been translated into actual law yet . 
  so freedom of movement is still a thing ... for now . 
  he 's not against a single market access for the uk . 
  he 's saying that they can only get a deal if they want to be treated like norway and switzerland i.e. 
  abide to eu regulations , freedom of movement etc. 
  some of which the uk , in case of brexit , clearly rejected . 
  that 's a very good overview right there !, 
  thanks a lot for writing it down . 
  the only thing you left out is that the council and the parliament can propose amendments to the proposed legislation . 
  but then i guess it 's easier to leave that out as it is a bit complicated . 
  only on the basis of the treaties and the objectives handed to them by the council . 
  [ see / u/zurthen 's comment here .

   the european parliament shall , jointly with the council , exercise legislative and budgetary functions . 
  it shall exercise functions of political control and consultation as laid down in the treaties . 
  it shall elect the president of the commission . 
  * article 14 , [ treaty of lisbon ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsupload/st06655-re01.en08.pdf ) [ page 30 ( 29 ) ] *  the european council shall provide the union w ith the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and prioriti es thereof . 
  it shall not exercise legislative functions . 
  * article 15 , [ treaty of lisbon ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsupload/st06655-re01.en08.pdf ) [ page 30 ( 29 ) ] *  the commission shall promote the general interest of the union and take appropriate initiatives to that end . 
  it shall ensure the application of the treaties , and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them . 
  it shall oversee the application of union law under the control of the court of justice of the european union . 
  it shall execute the budget and manage programmes . 
  it shall exercise coordinating , executive and management functions , as laid down in the treaties . 
  * article 17 , treaty of lisbon [ treaty of lisbon ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsupload/st06655-re01.en08.pdf ) [ page33 ( 32 ) ] * tl ; dr only the council can decide in which way the treaties should be changed . 
  the commision is not a government . 
  it 's mandate monitor the application of the treaties and propose laws based on the what `` direction '' the union is heading in . 
  hmm , i would definetely call it notl\u00fcge . 
  i honestly do n't know what the difference between `` white lie '' and `` notl\u00fcge '' is supposed to be . 
  i can sympathise . 
  but we beat bitcoin before and can do it again !, 
  i am currently assimilating the german flag , but i might switch back to help out protect the eifel tower and megaman . 
  i 've never touched megaman !, 
  in fact , i helped rebuild the french flag and megaman all morning , 
  we should perhaps also think about which stripe we should focus on first . 
  i am working on italy 's flag after i helped constructing the bottom part of the french flag < 3 let 's make this happen !, 
  edit : after some more reading i descided to put my effort into the spanish flag for now . 
  well , duh !, 
  humans are extremely emotional beings . 
  that 's why we leave decision making to unbiased 3rd parties . 
  same reason we do n't let families of murder victims preside over cases against their murderers . 
  that was not my intent at all . 
  i wanted to respond to the '' ... at any moment '' part specifically , because that danger is , indeed , incredibly low . 
  we 're not a war zone . 
  feels pretty rad i 'd say . 
  the danger is greatly exaggerated . 
  islam is not a single united movement . 
  go spread your bullshit somewhere else . 
  usually such bans include a ban on all successor organisations as well . 
  so the same people ca n't - at least de jure - be involved in any of its successors . 
  sure . 
  the point is strust in the institutions giving you said nice piece of paper . 
  the question is if buyers would trust a german government agency in a situation where large scale sell off of those reserves is needed . 
  it 's more sensible to store chunks of your gold reserves abroad . 
  if germany were to default today it would sell the gold to keep the core state functioning . 
  it 's much easier to sell the gold when it 's already in the country that would be able to buy it . 
  they say : muh, 
   there is a reason why the ministers-president of the free state of bavaria is not a sitting member of the german bundestag , writing legislation that retro-actively applies to the whole german federation . 
  in political theory , this is the difference between a feudal government and a democracy .
