  however , not all drinking establishments will take cards . 
  * ps : the above applies to visa/mc . 
  if you 're travelling with amex , all bets are off * ** especially ** * if it 's the older-style amex without the chip on it . 
  i travel a fair bit within europe ( last two years on business : rome , madrid , brussels , utrecht , munich , stockholm , schweinfurt ... and on holiday : london , and throughout iceland , finland , latvia , lithuania , and estonia ) and extensively throughout poland , where i live . 
  some places use cards a lot and some do n't . 
  the netherlands seemed to be * very * card-friendly for instance . 
  some places are friendly for some kinds of cards but not others ( amex , blech ) . 
  some places it is wise to keep cash and card handy because it can be tricky to know when one will be accepted and the other wo n't ( taxis are always a question mark ) . 
  i tend to carry more cash than i normally would because of the fact that whenever i travel on business i have to use a goddamned american express which many places rightfully loathe and refuse to accept even when they accept visa/mastercard . 
  btw , to stay vaguely on topic : i wish poland would convert to the euro . 
  the zloty is relatively steady against the euro , hovering around 1 eur to 4.1-4 .4 pln , but it tends to fluctuate a lot more against other currencies ( against the usd it has gone from 1:3.3 to about 1:3.9 this year ) . 
  yeah , we rock very nearly equally !, 
  stupid people say stupid shit . 
  it is fucking hilarious that they are this stupid . 
  wait , no , it 's a little sad . 
  i once paid a very expensive ticket in norway for about the same infraction ( 20 over ) . 
  i was entirely at fault and while i hated having to pay the fine ... it was my fault , and i knew they dealt with speeding there quite harshly . 
  so , yeah , no leniency for this guy . 
  do n't do the crime if you do n't want to do the time ( so to speak ) . 
  ... bearded ? 
  this is something that is en vogue right now , so i see more beards than i did 10 years ago , but that is n't to say it is common here . 
  of course , polish men of a certain age ( 50 + ) are very fond of having moustaches but that 's not the same thing . 
  uh the a4 on the polish side , heading east , * still * basically looks like that . 
  it 's 50 kilometers of thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa ... just drove it friday , about 70 kph the entire time ( the speed limit for almost all of that bit of road ) . 
  that being said , when i first moved to poland in 2005 it took about 11-12 hours to drive to the seaside from krakow ( doing the speed limit ) . 
  now it takes around 7 with the major impediment being the lack of a motorway between katowice and lodz . 
  my wife ( and a number of our friends ) smoke . 
  we were recently talking about the smoking ban in poland ; she said she does n't mind going outside to smoke at all and in fact kind of likes it . 
  as a non-smoker in poland prior to the ban , i simply stopped going out to bars with my wife and friends unless there was going to be someone there i had n't seen in awhile . 
  i hated my clothes smelling like ass the next day . 
  i see the same sort of shitty driving in krakow . 
  of course , it 's all relative - i was in calcutta , india a year ago and was really surprised that i never saw any accidents given the driving . 
  my wife and i were commenting on this the other day ; we 're vacationing in denmark ( bornholm ) and there 's almost no outdoor advertisements . 
  going through any village in poland , where we 're from , is an assault of advertisements for shit that absolutely no one wants . 
  it 's really nice then being here and seeing that people really respect where they live and do n't spoil it . 
  i 'm fairly liberal , do n't support pis , etc. 
  that being said , fuck off , bono , you 're better at uniting the mouth-breathers among us than the threat of an eu wrist-slap for poland ... and we really do n't need them any more united or paranoid than they already are . 
  do n't worry , most poles irl are n't like the frothing , twitchy , pis-supporting , anti-everything types you see here . 
  oh and i should note that there are a number of very balanced poles posting around here as well but the pole trolls are * very * vocal . 
  signal to noise and all that . 
  hah i like this logic . 
  you 're in a cold and dark place . 
  solution ? 
  play with fire . 
  normal people would turn on the lights and put on a sweater . 
  go ahead and attack me . 
  i pay my taxes even though pis does n't represent me or my family in any way ( quite the opposite ) . 
  i do n't support pis nor their various poorly thought-out and often vindictive policies and yet , at the same time , do n't think their supporters should be deported or imprisoned . 
  and no , neither myself nor my family will leave despite all of the negativity and hate from pis and its supporters because this is our home . 
  some day pis will be out of power . 
  it will take time to undo the damage they 've caused but it can be done in time . 
  `` nyah nyah , you told us we were n't allowed to play with fire and now we 're doing just that and also 3rd degree burns make one strong !, 
  we 're independent , see ??? 
  hey hungary , pass the fire extinguisher !, 
  thx ! '', 
  it 's easy to get in and a pita to get out . 
  most lapsed catholics do n't bother going through the bullshit to officially get out . 
  i think we 're paying about 40 pln/mo ( 9.5 eur ) for 30mb/s ( [ down * and * up !, 
  ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/5124488058.png ) ) in krakow . 
  we * were * paying 85 pln/mo ( 20 eur ) for 10mb/2mb with upc , but finally got fed up with their terrible service ( monthly , sometimes weekly outages ) and switched a few months ago . 
  i 'm pretty happy with my [ lte service from t-mobile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3mhvdmd.png ) on our various phones , though . 
  i do n't recall how much we 're paying , but it is n't too bad , especially considering the amount of data we get each month and the speed . 
  there are plenty of places in western europe that do n't take amex as well . 
  it 's an absolutely terrible card to travel with if it 's your only one . 
  i ca n't speak for the whole group , but i 'm personally sick of hearing how shit the eu is , how shit europe is , and how poor we all are and how we all want to move to uk . 
  it gets annoying after awhile so , yeah , it might be time to get the hell out and see how well that works out for you . 
  if it does , well , then that 's going to be tough for us to deal with and will mean we will have to take a really hard , serious look at the eu and either do some major reformation or ( sadly ) watch it slowly fall apart but a strong uk economy will be good for the eu ( exports ) . 
  if it does n't work out for you - meaning your economy contracts - well that is going to be shitty for everyone ( less imports ) , but there 's also the schadenfreude so it wo n't be all bad . 
  that 's funny that you noticed this ; i 've made this same comment to my polish wife - you 'd think that we 'd have dozens of kinds of potatoes . 
  the same is true for men - hang around with a bunch of sex-starved morons all day , shooting civilians and sometimes the enemy ( sometimes the same as civilians ) , enslave women , participate in thefts , corruption , etc at other times . 
  couch it all in some twisted interpretation of the koran . 
  does n't sound very appealing for either genders . 
  bud light 's abv is 4.2 . 
  this is low but not , obviously , nonexistent - two such 350 ml beers will have the same amount of alcohol as a standard shot of vodka ( 30 ml ) . 
  it 's just that it is very tasteless and sad . 
  that may be true ; i 've spent very little time in the south/south east of the us - last time was in florida on business 15 years ago . 
  during this trip ( through co , mt , wy , etc ) i referenced , i did make a point to check out trip advisor and/or yelp both before we left and while we were there . 
  the one time that we went out and i had no choice in the matter was to a chinese restaurant in denver and we had tsingtao which is nothing special . 
  of course you have to look for it . 
  same as if you go to a pub in the uk , if you 're not paying attention you 'll end up drinking stella and wondering wtf everyone was talking about . 
  ps : that actually happened to my wife and i , although it was about 8 years ago when we were in london . 
  some pub we were at had stella on tap and something else that was even * less * appealing . 
  it was disheartening . 
  fortunately , last time ( last february ) we were in london there was a fuller 's pub around the corner from where we were staying so we drank a lot pretty good beer . 
  i 'm quite fond of london pride but i think we sampled just about everything they had on tap and enjoyed most of it . 
  sorry , but either you 've never had american beer or you drank something terrible like coors or budweiser . 
  it would be like me visiting the uk and thinking that everyone drinks diamond white ( in the park ( england ) ) , buckfast ( all places ( in scotland ) ) , or ... i do n't know what they drink in wales . 
  sheep 's blood mixed with something ? 
  point is , if you visit some place and then order the cheapest shit possible , well then big surprise , you 're going to end up drinking cheap shit . 
  montana alone has at least a half-dozen good breweries cranking out 30 + interesting , tasty beers and they do n't even have * half * the population of the greater manchester area !, 
  we drank [ brown ale ] ( http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/751/2296/ ) in montana , [ porter ] ( http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/63/198/ ) in oregon , [ esb ] ( http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13446/29263/ ) in wyoming , and [ ipa ] ( http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/12706/43728/ ) in colorado !, 
  not all of it was mind-meltingly awesome , but it was all at least * good * and some of it was great . 
  if you continue to eschew beer from the us ... you continue to cheat yourself . 
  oh and we also drank some pretty good cider ( mostly in oregon ) and several bottles of excellent made-in-oregon [ pinot noir ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3hq15d/i_am_actor_patrick_stewart_of_yorkshire_xmen_star/cu9hzli ) . 
  now while i originally hail from portland ( the good one , in oregon ) . 
  i know for a fact that you can get good beer anywhere . 
  just last year i spent several weeks driving through colorado , wyoming , montana , utah , idaho , and washington . 
  every pub/restaurant we stopped at had a handful of microbrews on tap or at least in the bottle . 
  keep in mind that wyoming and montana have no one living in them - that you can still get great beer in those places is fact . 
  i do n't know about the chocolate ; i did n't buy any anywhere except portland and then it was all m&m s ( my polish co-workers consume peanut butter m&m s in the manner of vacuum cleaners .
