  however , either we all get the same rights ... or we do n't . 
  if no one can insult the president , then all insults should be banned . 
  if no one can insult rydzyk 's delicate sensibilities then all sensibilities for all people should be protected . 
  otherwise it 's just arbitrary and pointless ... which it is ... and thus why speech should be free and people should have to show that real harm has been done by some speech or printed word . 
  and i think that either you can insult everyone ... or you ca n't insult anyone . 
  anyone or any institution that requires the law - and threats of fines , or imprisonment - in order to ensure that they are `` respected '' ... does n't have the kind of respect that they crave . 
  the tabloids in poland have * nothing * on the likes of the sun and that 's before you ignore the `` you ca n't insult the president '' - type laws . 
  i am not certain but i do n't think so . 
  actually , i am fairly certain that rehabilitation does work . 
  it 's just not very popular as most people want `` justice '' ( punishment ) . 
  [ source 1 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/26/prison-sweden-not-punishment-nils-oberg ) and [ source 2 ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html ) are about rehabilitation during incarceration in sweden and norway respectively . 
  you 're probably right . 
  or ... or ... 
  i do n't know , good mental health services ? 
  or even , perhaps , a society that does not think that lighting someone on * fire * is a `` prank '' . 
  that being said , everyone at that dealership that did anything to that kid ought to be serving time . 
  whereas his manager , colleagues , and the dealership 's owner seem to be sleeping fairly soundly . 
  my brother-in-law lives there . 
  tag away . 
  my wife was in a grocery store in the us , buying beer . 
  she had to show her id . 
  she was born december 13th . 
  so it was 13/12/19xx . 
  the clerk said in amazement `` wow !, 
  you guys have 13 months ??! '', 
  they 're definitely lockable in poland . 
  around 28 . 
  23 on personal holidays , the other 5 on business trips . 
  i do n't count a visit unless i 've spent at least a full day somewhere . 
  airports do n't count . 
  most places i 've spent around 3 days and some a couple of weeks . 
  australia ( business ) , austria , belgium , bulgaria ( business ) , canada , czech republic ( 3x ) , denmark ( 2x ) , estonia , finland , france , germany ( 2x ) , iceland , india ( 3x , business ) , ireland , italy ( 2x ) , latvia , lithuania , netherlands ( 2x ) , norway ( 3x ) , philippines ( business ) , poland ( where i live now ) , slovakia ( 3x ) , slovenia ( 2x ) , south africa ( business ) , spain , sweden ( 3x ) , uk ( 2x ) , and the us ( where i grew up ) . 
  i 'll add another three soon , and maybe a fourth or fifth by the end of the year . 
  i had to ask my wife about this ; she 's the one that actually speaks polish . 
  she agreed . 
  i wo n't be back in the us ( pnw/alaska ) until sept 2018 . 
  sit tight . 
  that 's great . 
  i 'll have to remember that . 
  `` to health ! '', 
  i 'd like to take this opportunity to say that * i * prefer a toast rather than a simple salute . 
  : + show some patriotism !, 
  '' * to the [ country you 're in ] navy !, 
  those guys do a hell of a job !, 
  * '' + perhaps something a bit more cerebral ? 
  '' * to weekdays !, 
  the thinking man 's weekend . 
  * '' + to * the * madman at home on gravel , snow , and tarmac : '' * to sebastian loeb , nine-time wrc champion and quite possibly the greatest living french citizen , may he always clip the apex !, 
  * '' + to those who 've journeyed to the other pole ... '' * to douglas mawson , ernest shackleton , and all those brave souls who first explored antarctica !, 
  * '' + and , obviously , to our mechanical explorers ... '' * to spirit , opportunity , and curiosity ... our first small steps on mars , but not our last !, 
  * '' + and , of course , those who have made the ultimate sacrifice . 
  '' * to jyn erso , cassian andor , k-2so , bodhi rook , and all rebels who fought and died on scarif : your sacrifices are no forgotten . 
  * '' i think you 'll find that while a `` prost !, 
  '' , `` na zdrowie '' , `` cheers '' , `` sl\u00e1inte '' , and so on are always welcome , a good toast will really knock things up a notch . 
  try it out and see for yourself . 
  no carpet in our home . 
  it 's hardwood ( kitchen , living room , bedroom ) or tiles ( hallway , bathroom , balconies ) everywhere . 
  hardwood is easy to clean and looks nice . 
  the easy to clean - especially with two cats that like to puke up hairballs ... and guests who occasionally spill drinks - is awesome . 
  i 've also never found it to be particularly cold , even in the dead of winter , but we 're a little abnormal - we do n't even bother turning the radiators on until it 's below 17c inside ... and that 's not very common in our block . 
  so we apparently tolerate the cold fairly well . 
  i asked my wife about this just now and she pointed out that we have true hardwood floors , rather than the `` panels '' sometimes seen in other homes . 
  she thinks they feel warmer in the winter . 
  my home : rain/snow/mud conditions outside ? 
  yes , shoes off . 
  otherwise , if it 's dry outside and/or you think your shoes are clean , then it 's your choice . 
  most people i know : shoes off . 
  exceptions : people that smoke , especially in the winter time , and smoking is n't allowed inside . 
  sometimes then shoes may be allowed on inside if you 're going out on the balcony to smoke every 45 min or so . 
  [ slovakia 's ppp is better than poland 's ] ( http://imgur.com/nfspwoo ) . 
  it would make sense that prices there are a bit higher than here . 
  damn . 
  they could have charged me 17 counts of violating that law . 
  luckily i 'm in poland where having far more than 5l of alcohol at home is just as normal as having a cross over the doorway . 
  do n't ask me . 
  i do n't understand how anyone here votes for someone like korwin-mikke . 
  well , ok ... maybe i can have a go . 
  if you look at maps of poland most of the country is fairly poor . 
  the western side is a bit better off than the eastern side . 
  the people in major cities like warsaw , krakow , katowice are very well off ( relatively speaking ) . 
  so people living in the eastern side of the country are struggling . 
  there are loads of politicians that play to those people . 
  basically they do the usual stuff - blaming the commies , the opposition , etc , etc. 
  it 's a bit of populism and nationalism and , ultimately , `` good jobs and stability will be here if we 're elected . '', 
  of course people eat that up because that 's what they really want . 
  the voters know that politicians come and go and just want their economic burdens to be lessened . 
  this is a big reason why pis is still quite popular : 500 pln/mo for families with two or more children until the children are 18 years old . 
  it 's thought that around [ 2.7 million families ] ( http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/1909-the-family-500-poland-s-new-child-benefit-programme ) qualify for this programme . 
  that represents around 25 % of the polish population . 
  there are other reasons and certainly commentators in / r/poland would claim it 's because po was stagnant/complacent and pis and others are listening to the people , dealing with corruption that the opposition ignored or created , pushing back against `` western '' liberal values , etc , etc , etc. 
  i do n't think that anyone in poland is really worried about immigrants . 
  poland is too poor to be an ideal place for immigrants . 
  the only immigrants we get are from ukraine and they integrate well because they are also white , christian , and are literally from the country next to us . 
  hell , they often come from parts of ukraine that used to be poland . 
  because they 're economic migrants , they can always be sent back if necessary . 
  corruption is n't something that the average voter really worries about either ... it 's more about `` getting back '' some nebulous entities for how poor everyone is compared to all of the rich bastards in the cities . 
  basically , the perception is : if someone is rich , if they drive a nice car , then they 're corrupt and/or in the mafia . 
  and those people deserve to be punished for their obvious crimes . 
  tl ; dr : i think it 's people saying `` fuck you ! '', 
  to whomever they can because they do n't like being poor and being treated like morons .
