  i liked that a lot and wish there was more truly quiet places here in poland . 
  my polish wife - who has travelled widely and eaten some very good meals in her life - * loves * taco bell . 
  when we were in iceland a few years ago we had to make a special trip to visit the taco bell in reykjavik . 
  grilled stuffed burritos ftw . 
  for poland it is the , apparently , the podkarpackie region/area . 
  centered around rzesz\u00f3w , it 's in the south-eastern part of the country , touching both slovakia and ukraine . 
  source : asked my polish wife and two of our polish friends . 
  we all live in krak\u00f3w so there may be some bias . 
  fifth gear is kind of like the grand tour : it was started when the old presenters got sacked . 
  you should have heard of it before , though , as jeremy accused them of burning down their set ( the old cool wall in particular ) at one point ... and if you 've watched the old episodes , you 've seen tiff needell on tg as he stepped in for james to do a bit of high-speed driving . 
  my phone , although these days that 's almost as obvious as oxygen and water . 
  i use it for many things . 
  - maps/gps stuff . 
  i travel a lot in europe and abroad so i have good maps ( i like navigon 's tho they 're expensive ) downloaded and saved - translations . 
  i 've got a lot of offline translation dictionaries . 
  - apple wallet ( tickets ) . 
  - gateguru & flightview to know what 's up with the flights . 
  - airport-specific apps ( frankfurt , munich , etc ) as backup for the above - traffic apps . 
  amzs , unterwegs , prevoz , traffikkflyt , darstraffic + , and the like ( waze , too ) - local bus and train apps . 
  `` sj '' for sweden , `` bus london '' and `` tube map '' for london , `` tft mobillett '' for norway , `` opal travel '' for australia , and so on - uber/mytaxi ( i 've been using mytaxi a lot recently ) - blablacar for giving rides to people - `` licenseplate '' for long road trips - `` bactrack '' the app combined with the bac measuring device to make sure i am ( or friends/family ) are ok to drive - airbnb 's app is pretty nice . 
  not sure how i feel about the company tho . 
  - weather stuff . 
  wunderground 's app usually since i like my weather to be * local * . 
  in poland i also use burzowo which tells of nearby lightning strikes . 
  - air quality apps like smok smog ( poland ) and `` global air quality '' ( krakow has a lot of smog :( unfortunately ) - apps to tell you where the nearest cashpoint/bankomat is at . 
  sometimes general map apps like navigon do n't have the latest data but i find that 1/2/3 apps from a given country 's biggest banks will tend to give better , more up-to-date data just in case i need actual cash - world time buddy ... best time zone app i 've used so far - the canary app for the canary device so i know what 's going on at home - tripadvisor for restaurant reviews . 
  yelp and zomato for backup - vivino to quickly look up some wine and see if it 's ok or not . 
  - paprika , the recipe manager ( tho i use it just for cocktail recipes and research ) - evernote ( my actual recipe manager , plus all kinds of random notes ) - apple 's notes app for grocery/shopping list ; i like that i can collaborate with my wife on this - photography stuff . 
  autostitch panorama for taking panos ( i hope they update it soon ) , filterstorm for editing . 
  - outdoor fun . 
  geocaching for geocaching , udisc to find disc golf courses - the canadiens app so i can wake up in the morning and , all too often , have a shitty morning - vr apps like `` skysafari '' and `` sky guide '' to identify stars and such , `` peak scanner '' and `` peakfinder '' to identify mountains , `` ship finder '' to identify ships , `` flightradar24 '' to identify planes in the air - apps to measure stuff . 
  there are seismometers , spl/decibel apps , `` cameraangle '' and `` tiltmeter '' to determine angles , object height , etc. . . - reddit for killing time and sometimes making very long posts that no one will really read - some games for when i get really bored . 
  recently it 's worms 3 . 
  edit : forgot to mention listening to audiobooks and music ( audible and books app for iphone , spotify and apple 's music app for my music ) , work stuff ( vpn app instead of the old school tokens ) , and news ( reddit again and bbc 's app ), 
  ummm ... osthyvel are available in poland . 
  i 've got a metal one for home and an all-plastic one for travelling . 
  i bought my parents a nice one when we were visiting them in the us ( at the tillamook cheese factory in oregon ) . 
  also , a slice of bread with cheese , meat , veggies , etc is common as muck here . 
  it 's called a '' [ kanapka ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kanapka&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqp4fhokvtahujliwkhvj5bekq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=689#tbm=isch&amp;q=kanapki ) '' . 
  the direct translation is `` sandwich '' but a proper kanapka is always an * open sandwich * - without the 2nd piece of bread . 
  ps : for any norwegians or swedes in poland : where can i buy brunost ( obviously gudbrandsdalsost but anything will do ) ? 
  we have what was supposed to be a second bathroom . 
  the washing machine is in there along with a some shelves and some washing lines . 
  so it 's the half storage and half washing room . 
  stay . 
  permanent visa immigrant from the us living in pl . 
  canada , nz , australia , or the us . 
  in that order . 
  i do n't like the heat ... and nz is admittedly a long way from everything ... and australia tends to be too warm ... and the us is , these days , just for quick visits . 
  you have very good taste . 
  note , however , that they change on different dates than in the us . 
  we 're a couple weeks off from them . 
  i had some lubelski apple cider tonight . 
  i wish the polish government would get rid of the stupid cider tax so it would be cheaper and they could sell more of it ... but i guess they 've got their hands full with more important things ( ahem ) . 
  according to all of the uk subreddits , all proper british people are constantly drinking tea . 
  he does n't mention it the same way he does n't mention breathing . 
  poland : * fried * pierogi ruski ... if they ai n't fried , they ai n't as good . 
  btw , my favourite foods from elsewhere : - sweden/norway : reindeer stew . 
  - england : home-made pasties . 
  st. stephan 's day pie , too . 
  - ireland : irish beef stew . 
  - czech republic : cz version of hungarian goulash ( hov\u011bz\u00ed gul\u00e1\u0161 ) . 
  the dumplings make the difference . 
  - france : almost everything ; you guys can even turn trash like snails into food . 
  lately it 's been steak au poivre . 
  - italy : i was going to say spaghetti carbonara , but the worst version of carbonara i ever had was in northern italy ... so italian-style ( ha ha ) pizza . 
  meaning `` super thin crust that you eat with a fork '' - germany : real sauerkraut . 
  also i had some white savoury sausage in small bread rolls in thuringia that were awesome . 
  we get fritz sodas here as well . 
  they 're good but a bit too expensive . 
  water . 
  if not that , then beer or wine depending on the dinner and time of year . 
  for me , for poland it is definitely oscypek . 
  it will undoubtedly be unpopular here , but the british know how to do cheese . 
  red leicester is a good example of this , but so is ... - sage derby - double gloucester - wensleydale ( regular and with cranberries ) - caerphilly ... and of course properly-made , aged for between 12 and 24 months ( ideally ) , cheddar . 
  i think that it may not be obvious for a foreigner or someone not familiar with the vinbudin ( is ) , vinmonopolet ( no ) , systembolaget ( se ) , and alko ( fi ) shops ... because while they * may * think `` liquor store '' they should be thinking about whether or not they can afford a [ fifth mortgage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=extrbkle27y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=53 ) because , in the north , the hooch is not cheap at ye olde state-owned-n-run booze shop . 
  and , if you 're in iceland , it also means planning carefully so that you manage to visit when it happens to be open which is for about 20 minutes a few times a week . 
  sounds like a variant of the japanese `` moshi-moshi '' used as a telephone-specific greeting . 
  greetings from poland !, 
  staring , especially by those at or past retirement age , is practically a national past-time here . 
  if there is * anything * different about you ( e.g. 
  accent , language , clothing , hairstyle , age , country of origin , etc ) you can expect extra staring . 
  i do n't know about germany , but here it does n't mean anything other than a combination of boredom and not being taught about that particular bit of `` good behaviour '' . 
  it 's understandable because almost all of those recipes originate in the us . 
  the entire country has little to do with the metric system except when it comes to drugs and - to some degree - bullets and socket wrench sizes . 
  if there 's a recipe that uses `` imperial '' units that i like , i measure everything twice the first time i make it . 
  first measurement is with cups/teaspoons/whatever and the second is on the scale . 
  i update my copy of the recipe with the appropriate metric units . 
  it 's a tiny bit annoying ... but the saying `` you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink '' is apropos . 
  i 've driven a variety of both , but more manuals than automatics . 
  these days , though , i prefer automatics . 
  the esg in our citro\u00ebn c4 was alright and the dsg in our vw cc is pretty nice - i really love it when i take my foot off the acceleration pedal and it immediately goes into freewheeling/neutral mode . 
  i 've visited them all ( norway 4x , sweden 3x , denmark 2x , and once each for finland and iceland ) and am returning to norway in a month . 
  in order : norway , sweden , finland , iceland , denmark . 
  why ? 
  norway has the best mix of landscape types and nice people . 
  sweden has nice people but the landscape is n't quite as to my liking . 
  finland , again , has nice people but it 's just a bit too flat . 
  iceland is awesome and has friendly folks in it but is just too far away from everything . 
  finally , for me , denmark is n't far enough north .
