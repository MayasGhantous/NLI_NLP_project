  you 'd expect this to be a standard procedure . 
  i mean , this crash killed the polish president and many prominent government figures ... 
  no , i 'd want them to stay in the asylum centers in turkey and surrounding countries ( where they are safe ) . 
  any `` refugee '' you see in europe is an economic migrant . 
  tfw francis personally leads an army into syria, 
   a lot of those people were fleein anyways enforcing eu borders would 've kept the initial groups away , which would in turn dissuade all the others to follow suit . 
  implying the pope is n't leading an army of 1.2 billion ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) . 
  it 's okay my bratanku , pi\u0142sudski will resurrect and rescue you : ddddd, 
  gib back wilno, 
  yuo are men now yu must choose wife and have children, 
  implying these people are in europe to do anything else than collect welfare checks and free apartments . 
  yeah , i was kind of scared he 'd do that and they 'd laugh him off . 
  but he essentially `` rekt '' her intellectually !, 
  russia or germany .

  italy or southern france .

  it 's not like he 's going to be persecuting any group of people in the us . 
  even last night , he was talking about fixing the inner cities ( which i assume has a lot of black americans ) because the democrats just make empty promises . 
  the people i 've met from there tend to be nice , but out countries have a bad past .

  at one point , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth was the biggest state in europe . 
   valentina nappi i 'm kind of ashamed i immediately knew who that was ... xd, 
   it 's actually the older generation that hates it it 's actually ironic because they were the ones to vote the eu into our countries , while most of us were just learning how to read and write . 
   communism was so much better and everybody had jobs and so on i hear this argument all the time , as well . 
  maybe there 's some truth to it ? 
  i ca n't say , because i was born in the late 90s . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  you should n't look at london as a representation of the young people of the uk . 
  as of the 2011 census , only 44.9 % of its inhabitants are white british and most people are foreign born ( 37 % born outside of the uk and 25 % outside of europe ) . 
  thus , these groups of people are most likely vote for the eu to remain in power . 
  just my observation .

  the blue area is also where real poles live . 
  we do get a lot of migrants and immigrants from the east ( eg ukraine ) .

  yes , abortion is murder . 
  it should only be used to save a mother 's life or if the fetus has an incurable/severe disease . 
  jack daniels, 
  boy , you north africans are taking butthurt to another level . 
  where am i trash talking chancellor merkel or spreading islamophobia ? 
  up above i mentioned that islam provides us with a societal structure of peace . 
  chancellor merkel is taking advantage of this situation by extending eu humanitarian aid and in turn the refugees show us the secrets to a utopian society !, 
  do n't you known muslims are peaceful people ? 
  herr merkel said it herself . 
  we ca n't be xenophobic bigots and close our borders .

  you 're getting downvoted by globalists that want to turn our countries into africa and the middle east . 
  well , according to eu leaders there would be nothing more peaceful than a european caliphate . 
  afaik native frenchmen did n't carry out there attacks , it was arab immigrants . 
   very aggressive ` migrants did 9/11 ' advertisements are you trying to imply that middle easterners were n't behind the attacks on 9/11 or in france ?

  what made you choose south korea ? 
  there 's lots of ukrainians , but up here in the gda\u0144sk area we also get a lot of russians from kaliningrad . 
   russian immigrants were a problem , they were 100x worse than the current refugees/immigrants . 
  i 'm not a fan of russians , but the truth is that russians/ukrainians assimilate better than middle easterners and north africans . 
  there 's lots of immigrants from russia and refugees from ukraine in my home city , so i must say that i 'd rather take ten russians/ukrainians over one mena immigrant . 
  why are there so many of our trucks abroad ? 
  is it just easier to register a company here and foreign businesses do that ? 
   world youth day it was a good time , though . 
  did you attend any of the events ?

  we have an old saying :  pole and hungarian -- two nephews , good for saber and for glass .

  most of those cities have been polish for centuries , in some cases over a thousand years ( like gda\u0144sk ) . 
  adding new members now would be like adding fuel to the fire . 
  the eu needs to work on solving its current problems .

  `` polish death camps '', 
  clinton wants to make the us an even bigger police force in the world , her meddling would n't exactly stabilize anything either .

  it would most likely be nato vs the east ( russia and middle eastern countries ) .
