  did something change in regards to freedom of press in poland within the last year ? 
  i am not aware of any such developments , but perhaps you could enlighten me on it . 
  if you referred to the state-owned tv and radio broadcaster being under control of the government - that always was the case in poland ever since the broadcaster was created back in the interwar period , so in that regard `` they treat the freedom of press '' just like every previous government in poland did . 
  the pistol was actually designed for the polish army in the early 30s , and produced for that purpose until 1939 . 
  35 * with polish markings visible . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/vis_wz_35_1775.jpg ) it was simply good enough that germans decided to continue its production after they took over the factory during the ww2 . 
  he stopped reading them after seeing the word `` soros '' . 
  even when it was under prussian/german control in 19th century , pozna\u0144 remained a polish-majority city , so not really . 
  the winter time is the regular time actually , it 's the summer one which is the daylight saving time . 
  and it 's working quite well for us so far . 
  til vietnamese look just like poles . 
   failure to address the use of coal will cost poland far , far more when climate change ( and climate refugees etc. ), 
  really start hitting . 
  contribution of poland to world 's pollution production is around 1 % - even if our entire country completely disappeared overnight , it would n't make any significant difference in the big picture . 
  so , basically it would be completely crippling our economy in the name of not changing anything in a long run anyway . 
   and the bill for air pollution is n't tiny either . 
  i 'd wager it 's still lower than bill for having to import most of our energy from abroad , or being forced to change the way of producing it to a very inefficient ( and expensive ) way . 
  yeah , why wo n't silly poland just close all its powerplants , and start buying way more expensive energy from other countries to keep the country running ? 
  who allowed such a serious oversight ? 
   , but coal is history and it is toxic . 
  and hydro , solar and wind power are not viable as primary energy sources in a flat , cloudy and not windy country such as poland , and attempts to make them our primary energy sources would be very * toxic * ... to our economy and electric bills of ordinary citizens . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but in poland maths already was on a [ very good level ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_school_of_mathematics ) long before commies took over the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lw%c3%b3w_school_of_mathematics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_school_ ( mathematics ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krak%c3%b3w_school_of_mathematics, 
   chile veered away from many of those reforms in 1990 after the election of aylwin . 
  and many of those reforms survived in some form to this day , considering that chile not only has by far the most liberal economy in south america , but in fact ranks rather high in that regard among the oecd countries . 
   you obviously have very little knowledge about lula 's administration and how it helped many people get out of poverty . 
  you obviously have very little knowledge of multitude of problems that were present in brazil for decades such as overgrown bureaucracy , rampant corruption , or bad economic policies , and on many accounts they are getting * worse * with time . 
  i did my fair share of reading on brazil before the world cup and olympics ... and it left me rather pessimistic in regards to the future of that country . 
   if you had n't noticed we have recession everywhere most countries are still growing , even if only by a little bit . 
  brazil is not among them . 
   because of banking crisis because that was caused by too liberal market and not enough regulations . 
  banking crisis merely hastened the surfacing of many other systemic problems with world economy , many of which such as the greek crisis were caused by opposite factors . 
   i do n't understand what is your point in engaging in discussion when all you do is just `` hurr durr communism bad '' . 
  i do n't understand what is your point in engaging in discussion when all you do is just `` hurr durr socialism not bad '' and `` hurr durr free market bad '' . 
  `` communism bad '' at least is a position which is objectively correct in every possible context , which sadly could n't be said about the one you 've been spreading in here for the last few years . 
   brazil has seen enormous gdp growth because of worker-friendly policies not liberalization of economy . 
  the same brazil which is just about to become a first world country ... for the last 70 years , and still without success ? 
  the same brazil that 's been in an * enormous * recession for the last few years ? 
  well , whatever they are doing , it 's not really working * that * well for them . 
   on top of that you seem to argue that chile got better only because of pinochet 's economical policies ? 
  surely there can be other causes , like ... uhmm ... converting to democracy ? 
  pretty much . 
  or , i 'd say , converting to democracy , and not electing socialists who would completely revert those free-market reforms . 
   anyways , my point is that reality is often more complicated and dissuading communism or capitalism based on `` it did n't work there '' is just silly without considering the big picture . 
  the reality indeed is more complicated , but one thing about it is pretty much constant - communism has never worked well anywhere . 
  does n't change the fact that during the last few decades they became the richest country in south america thanks to their free-market reforms , while in the same time period initially more well-off venezuela became a shithole thanks to repeatedly electing socialists . 
   pinochet introduced very liberal economic policies that hurt many people , only after he lost power they got better . 
  interestingly enough , most of his economic policies were kept , and chile to this day remains the most economically liberal country in south america , by a huge marign . 
  not neccesarily thanks to the entering the eu , as there actually [ was n't much difference in growth rates , ] ( http://galeria.bankier.pl/p/5/b/57cab80b0587cb-645-256-0-0-927-368.png ) in that period compared to the earlier one . 
  it 's just that if the * growth rates * remain constant for long enough , the cumulative chart starts to look hyperbolic , [ here 's a similar example ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/prc1952-2005gdp.gif ) . 
   i mean the topic of communism seems pretty ripe with misinformation in general and you certainly seem to continue this trend with your posts in this thread . 
  lol you had to normally pay for food , * and * [ you could buy it only in very limited ammounts ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/6/5219/z5219406q,polska-kartka-na-artykuly-spozywcze.jpg ) - that is , if the store was n't empty , which more often than not was the case . 
   worker 's state was never the goal in soviet controlled countries of course it was n't . 
  neither it was a goal in any other country communists got into power . 
  that alone speaks volumes about viability of this ideology . 
   it was another version of aristocratic state where the party has all the power while common people have none precisely - that 's what attempts to implement `` communism '' always result in . 
   the `` communist '' part was just a lie for the people . 
  the entire idea of `` communism '' is a big lie in itself , as its an imaginary system incompatible with human nature , and thus requiring using extensive ammounts of force to achieve even a far approximation of it . 
   do people actually believe north korea is democratic and republican ? 
  and do people believe nazi germany was * actually * nazi ? 
  communist parties have a 100 % failure rate so far , surely it 's obvious by now that it 's the * ideology * which is the problem , not its implementation . 
   none of the `` commie '' countries ever claimed to have ever reached the stage of full communism not for the lack of trying , the `` opressive state capitalism '' is simply the closest approximation of the communist fairytale one can achieve in real world . 
  luckily , after a century of immeasurable suffering this fairytale caused , we can all agree to put it where it belongs - into dustbin of history . 
   about conquered minor axis powers ... as well as poland and czechoslovakia , * supposedly * allies of britain and france . 
  yeah , just like the famous `` big cities & rural southeastern poland vs the rest of the country '' division , that used to show up during the 90s . 
  yeah , and the next time the parties will fraction and shuffle , the apparent `` regional differences '' will suddenly shift once again . 
  if not so long ago the current pis stronghold in the south was comfortable voting for the same candidate big cities did , while everyone else voted for a different one , clearly the difference in values is n't so big , do n't you think ? 
   presidential elections ( especially 2nd rounds ) have very different dynamics , as the choices are artificially constrained to 2 . 
  the dynamics was actually rather consistent in this case , and the pattern from 1995 elections still [ somewhat appeared in 1997 parliamentary ones . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/wybory_sejm_1997.png ) sure , it also resemble the late 00s pattern a bit , but there are fundamental differences , most notably - most of the big cities voted just like * south and east rural poland * , the exact opposite of how it 's now . 
  what happened ? 
  the two major political blocs in poland used to be post-solidarity ( wa\u0142\u0119sa in 1995 , aws in 1997 ) , and post-commies ( kwa\u015bniewski in 1995 , sld in 1997 ) . 
  before the 2001 elections , the post-solidarity bloc split into liberal-conservative po and national-conservative pis ( while aws gradually dissolved ) . 
  post-commies won the 2001 elections ... and soon after almost completely collapsed due to a series of scandals and forever stopped being a major force in polish politics . 
  ever since then , the polish political scene was almost completely dominated by the two parties the post-solidarity faction split into . 
  and while the parties got strongly conflicted , and both of them strongly push to divide the society ... the differences between their supporters as well as between parties themselves are still way smaller than it would appear on the first glance . 
  this one 's from 2007 , almost 10 years ago . 
  and if we are posting some historical maps , [ here 's ( lack ) of pattern from the 2005 elections , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/wybory_sejm_2005_barry_kent.png ) and here 's a very [ interesting pattern from 1995 elections ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_bm6sdagkelhdbtawbcig7wdvmtq3gwqd.jpg ) , completely unlike the one you posted . 
  the famous `` german empire '' electoral pattern reposted ad infinitum on this sub indeed used to appear for a few years , but it was merely a glimpse and not some permanent feature of polish political system/indicative of some deep division/etc . 
  in the cities you mentioned they happen to be rather similar , with krak\u00f3w perhaps being slightly more conservative than the other two , and warsaw having a large variation from district to district which averages to a level comparable to pozna\u0144 . 
  [ the election map in 2015 ] ( http://x0.cdn02.imgwykop.pl/c0834752/01zr7a1_lf5pm2fs8l6nmqx5agpwu9kxn0dmvwmg,w600.jpg ), 
   are polish standards ? 
  all three would be pretty much the same , to be frank . 
  he clearly meant `` the only major actor left '' as in `` the only major actor still remaining '' , not `` the only left-wing one '' . 
  interestingly , neither pis is * left-wing * , nor razem is * major * . 
   sound like a kid who got caught doing something wrong and is snitching on other kids . 
  and you sound like a kid who is trying really hard to make a one specific kid look bad , by blowing some football hooligans shitty banter incident out of proportion . 
   i 'm aware it 's not limited to polish soccer . 
  does n't make this any less wrong . 
  i 'll be awaiting your long and angry rant on systemic english/dutch antisemitism , and how it 's just another in a long series of similar incidents in those countries the next time it happens then . 
   that they are `` only '' calling them jews as a big insult [ and they take it as such ] and making fun of anything jewish related ? 
  i hope you were similarly eager to point out the shameful , longline incidents of [ `` english antisemitism '' ] ( http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/arsenal-fans-filmed-shouting-f-jews-before-north-london-derby/ ) , or perhaps the [ `` dutch antisemitism '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-police-investigate-burn-the-jews-anti-semitic-chants-at-fc-utrect-vs-ajax-football-match-10160426.html ) as well , because clubs like tottenham or ajax in those countries are also sometimes called jews as a big insult and made fun of anything jewish-related . 
  polish football fans being mean to other polish football fans = so bad and unsafe . 
  not exactly - south korea is 30 % * christian * - 20 % protestant , and only 10 % catholic . 
  as it 's only catholicism which is the sole responsible factor according to fedora tipping op , i fail to believe 10 % of population is so influential ( not to even mention japan , where it 's even less ) . 
   poland had a gdp of 205 billion euro when it coined the eu in 2004 . 
  poland also had a gdp of 64 billion dollars back in 1990 , and without those structural funds still managed to [ grow at the same or even higher rate ] ( http://galeria.bankier.pl/p/5/b/57cab80b0587cb-645-256-0-0-927-368.png ) before joining the eu . 
   but the eu also played a role in the development of poland . 
  the role which is vastly overstated by most foreigners . 
  sure , we got some nice spare change , and we built a few roads a few years earlier , but it 's not like we would n't manage without them .
