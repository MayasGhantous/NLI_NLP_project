  if not for communists in power , i doubt the * entire * city would be remodelled according to corbusier 's disastrous principles . 
  rotterdam was also almost completely destroyed during ww2 , and yet was rebuilt in a much better way than warsaw . 
   the modernist planning has advantages as well , one being the space that you mention . 
  it 's not neccessarily an advantage , as there 's simply * way too much * wasted empty space in warsaw and everything is so spread out because of that . 
  city centers should be densely packed , and while warsaw is visibly improving in that regard lately , when i visit other european capitals warsaw [ still almost feels like this in comparison . 
  ] ( http://beyonddc.com/log/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/downtownhouston.jpg ), 
  still better than looking like a knockoff of chelyabinsk or other krasnoyarsk , which is how warsaw looked like before the new skyscrapers were built . 
  sure , as one out of many similarly sized skyscrapers it 's acceptable , but were it to remain the centerpiece of warsaw i 'd definitly be fully for its demolition . 
   beacause the building itself is really beautiful . 
  it also looks * exactly * like several other buildings located in moscow , so we obviously do n't want this kind of building forming the center of our skyline . 
   but i 'd preferred if they tried to rebuild more of the old city than just modernising it and making it like most other globopolises . 
  clean , safe , modern but utterly anonymous and unoriginal . 
  the chance for that was utterly lost somewhere in the mid 60s , when the remaining parts of center were built over with ugly commieblocks instead of having the pre-war grid layout rebuilt . 
  right now , the new , modern buildings are simply being built in empty lots between those commieblocks ( and commie city planners left * a lot * of those empty spaces , as their city design was incredibly low-density and wasteful ) . 
  the damage done to urban fabric of the city by atrocious commie planning was so extensive , that it 's simply impossible to `` rebuild more of the old city '' without spending hundreds of billions on buying out commieblocks littering the center and demolishing them , which is obviously unaffordable . 
  the best thing we can do is to at least make it modern and like most other globopolises , which will still be a huge improvement over the sad state warsaw was in 1989 . 
   why do n't you leave the eu then ? 
  because , as of now , it 's more beneficial for us to stay inside the free trade area eu provides , rather than * outside * it . 
  i certainly hope we will leave eu the very moment its cons will outweigh the pros , but that moment is yet to come . 
   the general sentiment is that eastern europe is kinda flourishing just thanks to the eu funds . 
  the general sentiment seems to have very little in common with facts then . 
  [ historical polish gdp growth . 
  ] ( http://galeria.bankier.pl/p/5/b/57cab80b0587cb-645-256-0-0-927-368.png ) as one can clearly see , we were having similar or even * higher * growth rates to the ones we have right now long before we 've recieved even a dime of eu funds . 
  so much for this mythical `` flourishing just thanks to the eu funds '' . 
  i 'm quite sure amassing such insane ammount of `` car on fire '' events would take at least a year if not more in warsaw . 
  good , i 'd rather have our funds cut than succumb to germany 's blackmail . 
  if seemingly the sole motivation behind eu funds is to ensure our countries will comply with even the most absurdal whims and demands germany issues towards us , then the sooner this farce ends the better . 
  i can see from the graph that in 26 years of capitalism ( with a little help of the biggest worldwide economic crisis since 1929 ) we managed to almost outdo the immense damage done during 44 years of soviet-imposed stagnation . 
  and , most importantly , we stopped the gap to * widen * with every passing year . 
  before the ww2 , most of eastern europe was more well off than greece or turkey , comparable to portugal or spain , with some countries on level of italy . 
  the most well-off czechoslovakia was on par with austria . 
  by your metric , pretty much most of europe was at `` africa-level poverty '' at the time . 
  as for comparison of the effects of communism on development of the country , here is one of some [ `` african-level '' countries that happened to on par after the ww2 , namely of portugal , spain , greece and poland . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/svfpu9k.jpg ) as we see , right after the immense devastation of ww2 polish economy was still on par with other `` african-level '' countries , even slightly ahead of them ... and then effects of communism started to show . 
   capitalism can fuck countries just as bad as 20th century communism the fundamental difference between the two is that while capitalism * sometimes * can fuck countries up , communism * always * does . 
   ottoman empire was an european power like it or not . 
  an asian power that held colonies in europe for many hundred years and even conquered a major european power ( byzantine ) . 
  you conveniently forgot article 197 of the constitution :  the organization of the constitutional tribunal , as well as the mode of proceedings before it , shall be specified by statute . 
  the legally binding statute * at the time * , according to which the tribunal * should have * proceeded , was very much specified by the law changed by pis . 
   in result of that vacuum tribunal had to proceed in accordance to constitution ... except it did n't , as article 197 of the constitution clearly states that `` the organization of the constitutional tribunal , as well as the mode of proceedings before it , shall be specified by statute . '', 
  and * until the moment * it 's deemed unconstitutional , the statute binding is the most recent one . 
  therefore , the reality is the opposite of what you claim , and in this particular case tribunal was proceeding * in breach * of the constitution , instead of `` in accordance with it '' , as it did not procced according to the mode specified by * legally binding statute * . 
   seat is the * sole active spanish brand * with a mass production potential and capability of developing its own models in-house . 
  today it operates as a subsidiary of the * volkswagen group *, 
  do you understand how economic comparison works ? 
  i presume you also consider the 0.8 % growth germany or uk have to be an incredible economical miracle , because after all it 's so much more in absolute numbers compared to our 3 % growth . 
   did we ? 
  if i remember correctly poland was the only country of the 2004 group that , at the time of accession , did n't fulfill all of the necessery requirements . 
  i tried to look for some sources supporting that revelation , but found none ( other than an information that poland negotiated several transition periods back in 2000 ) so i 'll consider it an empty claim until proven otherwise . 
  anyhow , i distinctly recall that romania and bulgaria were also initially included in the same group as 2004 countries , but as the time progressed it became apparent they are unable to meet all the neccessary requirements by the deadline , and their accession was delayed by a few years . 
  at the same time , croatia and fyrom also were candidate countries , and were even further behind on their criteria fulfillment , which resulted in croatia joining only in 2013 , and fyrom still being outside the eu right now . 
  if poland truly was so much behind on fulfiling criteria compared to all the other 2004 countries as you claim , we would join the eu together with romania and bulgaria , and not in 2004 . 
  and if instead of having our successful liberal economical reforms in early 90s we followed the path of trying to sustain the inefficient state enterprises like other countries that were on the same level as us in 1991 - belarus and ukraine - we would never be able to join the eu in a reasonable timeframe . 
  to answer your question - yes , we did . 
  the fact that we joined the eu ( and did so at the first moment possible ) is a * result * of our good economic performance since the ~ 1993 , not a * cause * of it . 
  the same is true in case of all the former soviet bloc countries - the ones that * become * well-off enough to join the eu , do so . 
  the ones that are not well-off enough ( a group in which only several balkan countries and moldova remain by now ) , have their systems completely incompatible with eu requirements ( like belarus and russia ) , or both ( ukraine ) - remain outside it . 
   it felt like giving us the membership was politically motivated rather than economically . 
  it was motivated by both of those factors , and both of them were important . 
  you are mixing cause with a result - they were n't admitted to the eu in large part * because * they were n't doing as well as poland in the 90s . 
   without eu membership we would have much slower growth not only after 2004 but since nineties . 
  it 's a two.way street , ultimately we were eligible for eu accession and considered a `` future eu member '' only because we were * already * doing fine in the first place . 
   all because the prospect of eu membership was a huge bonus for investors from the west . 
  also there were pre-accession eu funding programmes like phare that helped directly . 
  it certainly did n't hurt , but painting it as the * main * reason for polish economic recovery from communism is majorly overstating its importance . 
  there could always be a thread like `` redditors from outside the us , which city is detroit of your country ? '', 
  as well . 
   with a big economic success that the eu membership helped poland achieve dit it ? 
  i was under impression that after joining the eu we simply [ continued to have moderately high growth rates we already had since the early 90s . 
  ] ( http://galeria.bankier.pl/p/3/2/889554349e568a-640-250-13-0-869-339.png )  anti-eu sentiment is so strong there ? 
  there 's no strong anti-eu sentiment in poland , most people are rather lukewarm about it - accepting it as status quo , but not really caring one way or another . 
   bulgaria was a target of terrorist attacks a couple of years back , and they 're similarly socially a very disingenuous comparison . 
  the terrorist attack in bulgaria a few years ago was commited by foreign terrorists specifically targeting a bus with israeli tourists , in contrast to terrorist attacks that were happening all over western europe recently , which were usually commited by domestic preparators with immigrant background , and targeted public spaces . 
  i have n't found detailed maps for 19th century censuses , but for 20th century ones : [ a 1916 map of polish population using data from 1910 austrian census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/mapa_rozsiedlenia_ludno%c5%9bci_polskiej_z_uwzgl%c4%99dnieniem_spis%c3%b3w_z_1916_roku.jpg ) [ a 1932 map of population distribution using data from polish census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/gus_languages1931_poland.jpg ) [ the data from 1931 census mapped by county ] ( http://s3.postimg.org/j5gzlscdv/polacy_kresy_d.png ) - note red , yellow and orange areas . 
   they most definitely did not `` belong '' to poland in the period i am referring to . 
  they belonged to poland from 1340 until 1772/95 , with 1795-1918 interlude of austrian control ( including the * de facto * polish autonomical government between 1867 and 1918 ) , and then again from 1918/9 until 1939 , to be most precise . 
  anyway , i 'm referring both to 19th century , as well as the interwar period , as there are no earlier detailed statistics of population distribution in this ethnically mixed area . 
  however one looks at it though , ukrainians truly * outweighed * poles in that area only after poles were forcibly removed from it in the period after 1939 . 
  i assumed you were referring to the current situation , considering that population statistics from 1800s ( and first half of 1900s ) were by no means so clear cut . 
  before the ww2-era ethnic cleansings and genocide , the currently ukrainian areas that belonged to poland until 1939 ranged from having a 10-20 % polish minority ( volhynia , stryj area ) , significant polish minority with ukrainian plurality ( stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w area ) , polish plurality with significant ukrainian minority ( tarnopol area ) , to polish majority ( many cities , most notably lw\u00f3w ) . 
   the only reason poland does n't make any claims is that ukrainian populations * outweighed * polish populations in those areas though the polish nobility held more power . 
  * outweigh * is a rather euphemistic word to use there , considering that almost entire polish population that used to inhabit those areas was either deported to gulags and siberia by soviets in 1939-41 , brutally murdered by upa-oun in 1943-44 , or ultimately deported to poland after the war . 
  if you actually read the article instead of only the title , you would know that it 's about tensions between polish and ukrainian governments regarding ukrainian glorification of war criminals who commited mass murder of poles during ww2 , and not about ukrainian immigrants living in poland right now . 
   polish propaganda was always pro-polish . 
  and representation poles in volynian massacre/tragedy/liberation as the pure victim which `` did nothing '' show us this clearly . 
  the volhynian genocide was a very asymetric event . 
  yes , there were some retaliation massacres from poles afterwards , but the death toll on polish side was at least 30-50 times higher according to every estimation done either by polish or international historians . 
  the version prevalent in polish national consciousness indeed is a slight distortion of a reality of those events , but it got nothing on the ukrainian version of `` equivalent mutual killings '' and `` polish-ukrainian ` war ' '' , which is an outright falsehood in comparison . 
   let me tell what ally do from my opinion . 
  they build rockets and explore space together , made science research together , fight together against common enemy . 
  whatever common projects poland and ukraine did , i do n't think it will last for long if ukraine will keep its current course . 
   but they do n't intervene into inside politics of each other . 
  if poles have different opinion then i do n't think that we are allies . 
  glorification of a criminal organization that commited severe crimes against humanity , such like oun-upa , ceases to be `` inside politics '' the moment it becomes an official stance of ukrainian government . 
  and if that 's the official stance of the ukrainian government , then i do n't think we are allies either . 
  polish `` propaganda '' during the last 20 or so years was immensely pro-ukrainian , but it seems that despite that ukrainians do not really fancy having poland as an ally with all their bandera and oun-upa worship lately . 
  keep being hostile to poland , and you 'll probably see some * actual * negative propaganda in a few years time . 
  stalin was anything but a `` great military commander '' though , he was an absolute failure during the polish-soviet war in 1920 , and many of his decisions during the ww2 were questionable at best . 
  the only `` butthurt '' ones here are ukrainians , who ca n't stand the fact that their list of potential national heroes is so short , they have to include genocidal organizations and nazi collabolators there , otherwise it would be completely empty . 
  he is worshipped because , unlike bandera , he also became a great military commander later on and actually won in the end .
