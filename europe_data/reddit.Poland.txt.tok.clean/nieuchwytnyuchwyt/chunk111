   btw here is capitalist rotterdam : cool , one building , looking like a quite modern office tower . 
  on a rectangular plot of land , surrounded by roads from the three sides . 
  wish something like that was the worst you could find in warsaw . 
  not * entire district * of 20 copypasted monstrosities osiedle za \u017belazn\u0105 bram\u0105 is . 
   i find the pkin , beautiful , i find the pkin taking way too much space than it deserves . 
  this building is wider than taller for fucks sake , and it 's the tallest building in warsaw !, 
   and also plac defilad ah yes , an overscaled deserted wasteland is how i like my city center as well . 
   before magic land started becoming privatized again to unknown people maybe the private owners will finally build some normal-sized buildings there . 
  i eagerly await the moment it finally will happen every time i see that sad place . 
   and it looks a lot better than what was built under what you call a `` normal system '' counting its empty surroundings , it takes up the entire 600m x 500m square in the very middle of the city . 
  how much attention does a fucking building need ? 
   and the capitalists with private land were to rebuilt warsaw in a better way ? 
  the probably would have moved the capital . 
  yeah , just like `` capitalists with private land '' left hiroshima , rotterdam , nagasaki , coventry , tokyo or hamburg in ruins , and moved those cities elsewhere . 
   encouraging the uprising says who ? 
  said radio moscow in its daily broadcasts to varsovians for the entire july of 1944 . 
   the armia ludowa was fully against it . 
  the armia ludowa was a small group of little relevance , and whatever they would or would n't do , had no real effect on anything . 
   they have those in capitalist countries . 
  those buildings are the equivalent of having corbusier 's [ infamous paris plan ] ( https://failedarchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pastedgraphic-10-830x619.jpg ) * actually * realized in practice . 
  on the picture 1 we have osiedle za \u017belazn\u0105 bram\u0105 , which is a complete disaster in every imaginable way , still occupying the very centre of warsaw . 
  show me anything like that in rotterdam , nuremberg or hamburg , cities that were also significantly destroyed during the ww2 before spouting bullshit that `` they have those in capitalist countries as well ! '' . 
   those buildings came from sweden . 
  we would most likely have the buildings like this from usa : under a normal system in place , nobody would even consider having such absurdally gigantic waste of space as pkin and plac defilad instead of proper downtown , as shown on picture number 2 . 
   blame the destruction of warsaw on the ak . 
  blame the incredibly shitty way in which a new city was built in the place of destroyed warsaw on commies . 
   the commies were against the uprising al ( but did join ) . 
  actually , the commie propaganda actively encouraged the uprising . 
  well , all you are saying is that the cost of building replicas of ~ 3 % of prewar warsaw ( and that 's a high estimate ) was to have rest of the city look like utter shit . 
  i mean , no way warsaw 's center would be riddled with atrocities such as these : [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/35/21/99/3521993b56c3c632c038886551ddd0fc.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/21/81/c8/z13140257v,plac-defilad--ratusz-chce-sprzedac-grunty-po-prawe.jpg ) had our post-war recovery happened under a normal capitalist economy instead of this sick and idiotic communist experiment imposed by soviet occupants . 
  [ most of warsaw looked like hiroshima ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/warsaw_ghetto_ruins.jpg ) after germans finished their razing of the city in late 1944 , and there pretty much was n't anything left other than some lone building here and there . 
  [ here is the old town . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/warsaw_old_town_1945.jpg ) after the war , most of the ruins was built over with shitty commieblocks in complete disregard to what was there before the planned destruction of the city , but faithful replicas of * some * landmarks including the old town were built , and most of them feel authentic enough , that you would n't know they are only 20 - 60 years old , if you were n't told so . 
   romania/bulgaria is closer to iraq than western europe among other interesting observations one can infer from your chart we have portugal being culturally closer to poland than to spain , malta and phillippines appearing to be the closest soulmates of each other ( and they also apparently form the core of the latin america ) , while nothern ireland seems to be what you 'll get if you stand exactly hafway between india and ireland . 
   it does not force then but you just said yourself in your previous post that '' [ forcing migrants is ] a logical step that benefits everyone else '' . 
  anyhow , better way of phrasing it would be that the eu * tries * to force them , but so far poland is opposing those attempts . 
  though the threats from eu towards poland about that matter have been getting increasingly out of hand lately . 
   how many immigrants from syria are there in poland right now ? 
  there were several hundred around a year ago , but i think they almost all left to germany by now . 
  so the eu * does * in fact force immigrants after all , despite your initial claim . 
   you do know that hungarians came from the russian steps , amerindians came from east asia and siberia through the bering strait as well , but that does n't mean they are n't called * indigenous americans * or * native americans * . 
   just like the slavics actually , the earliest traces of proto-slavic tribes were found in general area of [ modern day eastern poland , belarus and ukraine . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/balto-slavic_lng.png ), 
   in most cases multiply times bigger , such as poland who is over 3x stronger economically speaking . 
  poland 's economy was also 3x stronger in 2004 than it was in 1992 . 
  ever since that sick socialist experiment we had imposed upon us ended , and we returned to a normal capitalist economy in the late 80s / early 90s , our economy has been steadily tripling in size every 12 years with or without the eu membership . 
   how does eu force imigrants ? 
  there was this little thing called migrant relocation program recently , that eu tried to force upon the countries vehemently opposed to it . 
   studies have shown `` studies '' pulled out of your ass . 
   so basically ; white people . 
  also known as * native europeans * . 
   and voted by a super majority to stay not really , only 17 million people out of 40 million eligible voters at the time voted to stay in 1975 referendum so , just like in 2016 referendum , there was no supermajority there either . 
  so , according to you , uk should n't have joined the eu in the first place then . 
  well , it 's difficult to see united kingdom without england as well . 
   i 'd like to use europe and eu interchangeably many people also use england and uk , or perhaps holland and the netherlands interchangeably , does n't mean it 's a good thing to do . 
  the war ended by lithuania losing in 1920 not the polish-lithuanian war , i was talking about the soviet-lithuanian war there , which is what you mentioned in the post i was replying to . 
  well , in bigger picture that 's indeed true in a way - the polish-lithuanian war in october 1920 was a direct consequence of the lithuanian-soviet treaty in july 1920 , in which soviets transferred a part of the territory conquered from poland ( which included wilno area ) in exchange for lithuania giving them military access to assist the soviet war effort against poland . 
   poland taking control of vilnius for 18 years . 
  i think you meant to say '' * re * taking '' there . 
   or they could have allied with lithuanians . 
  yes , [ that was the initial plan . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_to_the_inhabitants_of_the_former_grand_duchy_of_lithuania ) instead of working with poland though , lithuanians decided to just say fuck everyone . 
   poles in vilnius region were n't defending from soviets , they were defending from lithuania . 
  not really , poles in the region were defending it from * everyone * , which included germans , soviets , and lithuanians . 
  and soviets clearly were the biggest danger , considering it was them who ultimately took the city from poles on january 5 , 1919 . 
   lithuanian government was actually in vilnius and had to evacuate when germans left . 
  bad luck lithuanian government : chose a city for your headquarters , its inhabitants are astonished why on earth are you there and chase you away . 
   exactly . 
  polish army still came and decided it was okay . 
  like i said , polish people forgot . 
  of course the polish army came . 
  how do you imagine it would have looked from the polish perspective if we took any other action : `` sir , the inhabitants of one of the major cities of the previous instance of our statehood , the commonwealth , proved themselves to be loyal polish patriots , organized polish administration and military groups , and are begging for the help of polish army ! '', 
  `` nah , just leave them to perish under bolsheviks , who cares about them . '', 
  everyone even remotely responsible for such decision would be sacked and have their political careers ended prematurely in the best case , and lynched by an angry mob in a more realistic scenario . 
   my point is that it was lithuania from 1323 to 1915 did n't you claim just one post ago that it was in russia from 1795 to 1915 though ? 
   and then someone forgot . 
  well , the ones who forgot were the very inhabitants of the city in question , because they were the ones who organized city 's administration and military groups under the polish flag when the german control ended in january 1919 . 
  the aid of regular troops of the polish army did not reach the city until after a few months afterwards . 
   soviets were never allies , they were occupants , from the polish point of view , lithuanians and soviets were co-belligerents in the summer of 1920 . 
   lithuanian-soviet war was happening at the same time as lithuanian-polish one . 
  yeah , a war that ended with ... soviets giving part of a territory they conquered from poland to lithuania . 
   not to mention poles had vilnius just because germans took it from russia . 
  poles also only had warsaw just because germans took it from russia , so i do n't really see what is your point here . 
   like i said instead of working with lithuania poles decided to just say fuck everyone . 
  instead of working with poland , lithuanians decided to just say fuck everyone ( perhaps except for their best buddies soviet russia ) . 
  this sentence describes what happened in that period exactly as good as yours . 
  not only , it was also controlled by poland in two separate earlier periods : * taken from the german ober-ost military command by the local polish military groups in * january 1919 * , lost to lit-bel soviet republic after five days of polish control . 
  * retaken from lit-bel soviet republic by the republic of poland in * april 1919 * , lost to soviet russia in * july 1920 * during their summer offensive . 
   if poles just gave the territory they took back from russians to lithuania during interwar period why on earth would poles even consider giving the inhabited by poles and jews territory , which was already controlled by republic of poland before soviet russia took it in june 1920 , to * republic of lithuania * ? 
  seems then that poland counts as `` germanic world '' now . 
   you could have gotten all of that by joining the eea and not receiving the cohesion funds . 
  but you did n't , you joined the eu in full . 
  maybe that 's indeed what we should have done . 
  sadly , there was a lot of misinformation during the 2003 campaign . 
  and frankly , i * wish * there were no cohesion funds at all . 
  we could have easily done without that spare change , and we woul n't have it used as the main argument against us whenever we dare to disagree with the powers that be . 
  really , the only reason i do n't want us to say `` well , screw your funds then '' for now is that all the other countries on a similar level to us are recieving them as well , so if we wo n't take them while eu keeps giving them to others , it would be equal to giving everyone else an unfair advantage . 
  i surely hope the future eu budgets will significantly reduce the ammount of those funds in regard to * all * countries though . 
   now i wish we actually had a unitary system where asylum seekers can be kept , tracked and then returned when the conflict is over , and making sure it does so quickly , but we do n't . 
  i wish we had a good border protection system where illegal migrants can be stopped , denied entry , and returned where they came from , and making sure it does so quickly , but we do n't .
