   partially because instead of focusing on getting that done we have people like you whinging about fantasist `` cultural replacement '' bollocks . 
  i 'm not sure whether you actually read the entire discussion , or just my last post out of context , but cultural replacement was * literally * what the guy i was replying to suggested . 
   and try to support a system where greece does n't get fucked we can send border guards to help secure greece their borders against influx of illegal migrants , we already helped hungary that way back when they had problem with mass illegal crossing of their southern border . 
  no , we signed up for economical cooperation , single market and the schengen area . 
  i do n't recall any requirements of self-hatred and cultural replacement during our eu accession process . 
   the problem is that almost half the population does n't support any political party at all ( which is the population part i belong to ) well , the same is the case in most other countries as well . 
  30 % support out of * entire population eligible for voting * is a lot . 
  seems like a good way to destroy the ( still ) existing popular support for eu in poland . 
  even if you do n't , you clearly do n't like the other guys even more , considering that fidesz keeps winning the elections easily . 
  the right to use their own language on a signs in areas where they live , and the right to write their name in its * actual * spelling would be a good start . 
  and those are basic rights various minorities in poland , such as germans , kashubians or even * lithuanians * recieve without much hassle . 
  yeah , it would n't be so easy to deny minority rights to poles living in lithuania otherwise . 
   til i 'm from one of three poorest places in eu * severen tsentralen * or * yuzhen tsentralen * in bulgaria ? 
  well , we had the worrisome process you are describing * actually * happen in europe during the last few decades , the only difference being that centre was constantly drifting to the * left * of the political spectrum . 
  you really ca n't bear having some right wingers in your safe space , can you ? 
  well , other than occasional tourist/expats asking for advice pretty much nothing ever happens on / r/poland , but in rare cases there actually is some political discussion there , it usually is noticeably better than the mindless circlejerk on / r/polska . 
  in regards to the ( nonexistant ) level of political pluralism and quality of debate present there , / r/polska seems to be pretty much a polish-language version of / r/unitedkingdom or / r/politics . 
  weird ? 
  that was something to be * expected * from germany , after all germany has a long history of shady deals with russia screwing over the countries between them . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  yet another bad legislation from the eu . 
  but i * do n't * want eu 's spare change . 
  i wish eu was n't giving any money to * anyone * . 
  sadly that 's not the case though , and as long as all the other countries on similar level to us are being given eu funds , it would be utterly moronic not to take them as well , as that way they 'd all get an unfair advantage over us . 
  i thought i already wrote it clearly in my posts in here - i do n't really care about poland getting transfer fees , those are absolutely minuscule ammounts and not the main reason poland opposes north stream . 
  i would gladly have poland not collecting any transfer fees other than maintenance costs , if that meant the nord stream was closed down and scrapped . 
  nothing of the sort . 
  transit from russia to germany to poland is the easieat , shortest and most convenient way . 
  it is a secure channel for germany , and provides * additional * security for poland , as poland can be absolutely sure that russia will not cut off their gas supply on a whim one day , because that would endanger their deal with germany . 
  now , let 's take a look of `` transit '' from russia to poland through germany . 
  the very idea sounds absolutely ridiculous to anyone who as much as caught a glimpse of the map of europe at least once . 
  it not only leaves poland vurnelable to russian threats and blackmail , as from now on russia can easily cut off gas supply to poland without any repercussions , but it also allows germany to `` help '' by offering to `` save '' poland from such dire predicament - by offering to sell very expensive gas to poland knowing it has no other choice . 
  three hurrahs for germany !, 
   you need to see the cause and effect . 
  so do you . 
  how do you think pis ended up with a absolute majoirty in the polish parliament in the first place ? 
  back in summer 2015 , pis had a steady lead in the polls , but not by a big enough marign to have a majority on their own - they were expected to form a coallition with one of the minor parties that were balancing on the electoral threshold - either libertarians ( korwin ) , agrarians ( psl ) or the `` pissed-off angry rightwing rock star '' party ( kukiz ' 15 ) . 
  then the pressure from certain countries , most notably germany , to take in migrants increased , and ultimately the conservative-liberal government at the time ( po ) , despite initial opppsition , * very * reluctantly agreed to the migrant relocation programme . 
  guess what happened later - voters were very disappointed , and support for po ( which already was n't doing all too well in the polls ) , further plummeted by several percentage points , which was just enough for national-conservative pis to win a majority on their own and need no coallition partner whatsoever . 
  and i do n't think i need to tell you how different the governmental dynamics would be in poland right now , was the government composed of a coallition . 
  well , if over there you are treating the eu structural funds as a form of bribes that are supposed to make countries receiving them do as you please on all other issues , then good fucking riddance . 
   current government even defending it . 
  no , the current government is defending poles having electricity in their homes , because that would no longer be the case if our power plants were closed down . 
   and i can not remember a polish proposal on the refugee-issue other then `` not my fucking problem '' well , any other proposal would be incredibly unpopular in polish society and very bad for any party that would attempt to make it , considering that this issue is * literally * `` not our fucking problem '' . 
  you are not exactly helping your argument here , as we both know that in such case germany would be very eager to sell gas to poland , that is , after demanding some `` transfer fees '' from poland , and increasing the price by a significant marign , making it just barely more cost-effective than importing lng to our ports . 
  so , it 's just like a typical german poster attempting to have a discussion about poland on / r/europe then . 
   in 1830 there was no independent poland . 
  no , but there briefly was in 1831 , when the parliament of congress poland ( which formally was an autonomous entity in personal union with russian empire at the time ) passed the act of dethronization of nicholas i and declared independence . 
  of course , after a few months of war russians defeated armies of kingdom of poland , but in the meanwhile it was a fully functioning independent country ( in a way , let 's say , confederate states of america were an independent country ) . 
  it certainly made * russians * busy enough that they would n't be able to participate in the dutch-belgian war though . 
   and gained independence from russian empire , apparently . 
  we [ briefly did at the time actually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_uprising ) , that is until the main russian army came to poland after a few months and defeated our army . 
   ryszard petru , currently the most important leader of the opposition yeah , til the chairman of the 4th biggest party in polish parliament , which enjoys support in margins of 8-9 % according to the recent polls , and who is widely seen as untrustworthy and incompetent is * the * `` leader of polish opposition '' according to the german press . 
  well , looking at it that way , with such `` opposition leaders '' pis do n't really have to worry about losing elections anytime soon . 
  if * netherlands * can afford f35s so can we , with our defence budget being bigger than theirs . 
   but this sub told me they have western values ... ? 
  banning symbols deemed `` totalitarian '' is very much in line with `` western values '' , germany being a prime example of a country with such laws . 
   most poles are happy with eu , precisely . 
  being happy with eu , and wanting eu to change into a more federal entity are two different things . 
   i dont think any other country has benefited as much . 
  actually , the list of countries benefiting more from eu than poland is quite long , and includes at least greece , portugal , hungary , slovenia , latvia , lithuania and estonia , which are all countries annually receiving * more * eu funds per capita than poland . 
  the graph on the right appears to be [ almost exclusively russia ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/a-history-of-terrorism-in-europe/img/russia-980.jpg?c=426 ) , most of that in causasus . 
  other than that , it also counts the [ war in donbass ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/a-history-of-terrorism-in-europe/img/ukraine-980.jpg?c=106 ) as hundreds of separate `` terrorist attacks '' for some reason . 
  would be way more informative , if both of those were marked with a different color . 
  pretty dishonest comparison , i 'm quite sure actions of mandela caused deaths of way more innocent people than those of mcguiness . 
   guess the only reasonable response for degenerate halfwits like that is to attack some other albanian people . 
  well , it was pretty funny seing albania in charge of banter , while they were n't any better on that particular matter . 
  still , that was well deserved 3-0 w.o. 
  for legia . 
   poland - legia ( polish football club ) hooligans got in fights with albanian football fans sometime ago . 
  that was after albanian hooligans almost murdered one of legia players during europa league qualification by throwing stones or something at him . 
  [ pfff . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93swedish_union ) and this one * actually * lasted for several years at least . 
   i would n't call plc as a slavic country . 
  of course it was n't . 
  how could it possibly be , when it obviously was a [ sarmatian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatism ) country . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth lasted for 225 years ( and 410 years including polish-lithuanian personal union ) . 
  not really , if anything it would be * you * who would have to make a case for calling a `` german '' someone who was born in kingdom of poland , lived most of his life in kingdom of poland , was one of the leaders defending kingdom of poland 's cities against teutonic knights , and died in the kingdom of poland . 
  the goal of prussian confederation was incorporation of royal prussia into kingdom of poland , which was achieved several years before copernicus was born , so it would be rather hard for him to fight for it . 
  the * actual * entity copernicus fought for against teutonic knights was * kingdom of poland * . 
   also copernicus lived in the duchy of prussia which was not in the holy roman empire but was definitly a german state actually , copernicus was born , lived most of his life and died in [ ** royal prussia ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_prussia ) which , * unlike * duchy of prussia , was an integral part of kingdom of poland . 
  attributing poland 's growth primarily to eu funds is even more dishonest than completely dismissing them . 
  our economy was already [ growing at similar rates long before we joined the eu .

    lol , but you did n't know most of france was an occupied territory . 
  as we already established , it 's only your deluded projection , and so weird one in fact , that i am rather baffled how could it possibly even get triggered . 
  you clearly asked * specifically * about the vichy government in the post i replied to . 
   a lot less in france [ citation needed ]  question , in other occupied countries do you think resistance fighters killing german soldiers were given flowers by himmler himslef or their babies were crucified ? 
  seems that the most traumatic event in the history of the french resistance was comparable to a regular tuesday in german-occupied poland then . 
   thank you for admitting your ignorance by not refuting my point . 
  same to you , in this discussion you did exactly how i would expect from someone who learned today about the obscure event called `` ww2 '' , and some distant country called `` poland '' . 
  few more years and maybe you 'll even convince someone that you actually know what you are talking about !, 
   northwestern is the north-west . 
  which is bretagne in france . 
  what you want to say is `` northern and western france '' . 
  what i want to say is northern france and its atlantic coast , or perhaps `` this banana shaped part to the left and top of the map '' , or maybe `` the upper half , with a panhanle '' , but i 'm very much enjoying your derailment of discussion into irrelevant semantics , as it 's the best sign you have absolutely no other arguments . 
   but nice way to try to prove you were n't clueless !, 
  this particular projection , likely steming from assuming that others share gaping holes in their knowledge similar to yours , is especially hillarious and yet another proof of your complete surrender . 
  for your consideration though , throughout many years i 've read dozens of various historical books regarding the ww2 era written by authors from entire world , and i could draw the map of europe , including allegiances , current leaders , and at times even detailed troop movements after any significant front change throughout that period from the memory . 
   * calls you constantly `` 5 year old ''  * complains about ad hominem i only started to call you `` 5 year old '' , after you started to use some completely ridiculous ad hominem arguments against me .
