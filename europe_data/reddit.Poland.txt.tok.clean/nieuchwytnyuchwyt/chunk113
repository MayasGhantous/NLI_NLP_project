  two can play this game . 
   i think i 'll continue to challenge poles about wwii , it 's just too good to see you getting mad !, 
  unfortunately , so far you failed to challenge me in any of your posts . 
  you managed to knock over some pieces , and crap on the board , but it only showed your gradually increasing frustration at inability to do anything other than that . 
  and while it was rather hillarious at first , your schtick started to get boring and repetitive after a while . 
   i do n't know why you bothered to list atrocities committed by vichy and other collaborators . 
  perhaps because you seemed quite amused about my very mention of them so , considering your kindergarten level of knowledge you express in all other topics , i assumed they were yet another thing you did n't know about . 
  to the point , those are atrocities commited by the direct continuation of the legitimate pre-war french government . 
  in stark contrast , you 'll find no such event connected with groups affiliated with the pre-war polish government . 
   so what i take from your butthurt reply is that either poles are just basically the poorest fighters and weakest people in europe , and by far . 
  fighting on lowlands without heavy equipment , and while being outnumbered is n't exactly the easiest feat - but we still tried . 
   germans could do what they wanted , built what they wanted and poles were just standing there crying in foetal position troughout the war . 
  and poland tried to oppose them , but it usually ended with 100 of polish civilians massacred by germans in retaliation to every german soldier killed . 
   so i 'll continue to read what objective historians say about poland in wwii , that includes the horror poles participated in and the polish resistant fighters . 
  good , five years old is a good moment to start reading ,  also , i 'm glad that you learned most of france was an occupied territory . 
  must have been hard to quickly read as much as possible about it to have something to reply . 
  i 'm glad you learned about existence of poland today . 
  must have been hard to quickly read as much as possible about it to have something to reply . 
   now you might want to take a few geography lessons or read more about it since you believe somehow it was in only in northern france . 
  if i wrote `` northwestern france ( including all atlantic coast to be exact ) '' , you would be butthurt that `` northwestern france suggests only a quarter of territory '' . 
  well , you can never please five year olds you attempt to discuss with . 
  to sum up , after a bunch of poorly researched rambling you initially threw at me , i totally expected you to start throwing shit at me the moment it was clear you utterly lost this discussion - so your hillarious attempts at * ad hominem * left me completely unsurprised . 
  hope to discuss with you once again in a few years , when you 'll grow up . 
   i 'm talking in percent of population nah , that would be some of the baltic states , or german-occupied parts of soviet union i 'm afraid . 
  ok . `` in july 1942 , the french police , under the orders of ren\u00e9 bousquet and his second in paris , jean leguay , organized , along with responsibles from the sncf train company , the vel 'd ` hiv raid which took place on july 16 and 17 july . 
  the police arrested 12,884 jews -- including 4,051 children which the gestapo had not asked for -- 5,082 women and 3,031 men , all sent to drancy . 
  by its own , this action represented more than a quarter of the 42,000 french jews sent to auschwitz in 1942 , of which only 811 would come back after the end of the war . 
  in 1995 , president jacques chirac recognized the responsibility of the french state for this raid . 
  in total , the vichy government helped in the deportation of 76,000 jews , although this number varies depending on the account , to german extermination camps ; only 2,500 survived the war . '', 
  [ source 1 ] ( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-french-vichy-regime ) `` many historians consider that an even worse crime was committed in vichy-controlled southern france , where the germans had no say . 
  in august 1942 , gendarmes were sent to hunt down foreign refugees . 
  families were seized in their houses or captured after manhunts across the countryside . 
  about 11,000 jews were transported to drancy in the paris suburbs , the main transit centre for auschwitz . 
  children as young as three were separated from their mothers - gendarmes used batons and hoses - before being sent to germany under french guard , after weeks of maltreatment . '', 
  [ source 2 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/jewish_deportation_01.shtml )  makes no sense , nazis could n't possibly operate and kill millions of jews everything is possible if you pacify the country with one of the most brutal and hostile occupations in history of mankind , conduct mass scale ethnic cleansing in annexed parts of the occupied country , and continuously station several hundred thousands to over one million soldiers on its territory . 
  holy shit , do n't tell me you did n't know that besides 3 million of polish jews , germans also killed around 3 million of ethnic poles , bringing the total ammount of polish casualties to over 6 millions . 
   in giant compounds in a country made up of heroes fighting them with only a very , very , very few collaborators . 
  impossible . 
  ... giant compounds built on the german-controled land , by german companies , maintained by german funds , and operated by german personnel . 
  polsih intelligence learned about those camps , [ informing the rest of allies about their existence ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/the_mass_extermination_of_jews_in_german_occupied.pdf ) , sabotaged the rails , and even organized some escape attempts , but there 's only so much you can do as a resistance force with only light equipment and not much of outside help . 
   holy shit , do n't tell me you did n't know that most of france was an occupied territory . 
  german occupation of northern france not only was much less severe than german occupation of poland , but also lasted for two years shorter . 
  holy shit , do n't tell me you did n't know that . 
   man your ignorance is so cringy i would just quit reddit altogether if i were you . 
  such words sound especially hillarious from the guy with amount of knowledge on ww2 comparable to a 5 year old . 
  and for all your smug talk in the beginning , your butthurt about being reminded about the french atrocities commited during ww2 was incredible . 
   yet poland had the highest number of jews killed . 
  poland also had the highest number of jews period . 
   that 's true pardon me , 75 % of the french jews survived ... and that was * despite * , rather than * thanks to * efforts of the french government in vichy . 
   country , with less people collaborating than anywhere else apparently , why did the nazis picked you to build all these death camps ? 
  because poland had by far the most jews in europe . 
   considering france , with a `` full-on collaborating government '' is just next door . 
  it would appear to me that doing such things on occupied territory would be even easier than in puppet states . 
   really ? 
  persecutory delusion much ? 
  maybe you do n't usually notice such articles , or perhaps those deliberately changing the national affiliation of nazi german death camps , but that does n't mean nobody does . 
  and they appear worryingly often in international press . 
   all occupied countries had active collaborators who were happy to help the nazis . 
  and poland is not a special snowflake , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland some excrepts for you : `` unlike in most european countries occupied by nazi germany -- where the germans sought and found true collaborators among the locals -- inoccupied poland there was no official collaboration either at the political or at the economic level . 
  [ 70 ] [ 71 ] poland also never officially surrendered to the germans . 
  [ 72 ] '' `` there is a general consensus among historians that there was very little collaboration with the nazis among the polish nation as a whole , compared to other german-occupied countries . 
  [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 75 ] depending on a definition of collaboration ( and of a polish citizen , based on ethnicity and minority status ) , scholars estimate number of `` polish collaborators '' at around several thousand in a population of about 35 million ( that number is supported by the israeli war crimes commission ) . 
  [ 76 ] '' `` however , research shows that at least as far as warsaw is concerned , the number of poles aiding jews far outnumbered those who sold out their jewish neighbours to the nazis . 
  according to the studies of historian gunnar s. paulsson , during the nazi occupation of warsaw 70,000 -- 90,000 polish gentiles aided jews , while 3,000 -- 4,000 were szmalcowniks , or blackmailers who collaborated with the nazis in persecuting the jews . 
  [ 88 ] ''  same can be said for france with the * actual * french government full-on collaborating with germany as a puppet vichy regime ? 
  not really . 
   but stop pretending all the poles were either victims or heroes fighting the nazis . 
  stop baselessly accusing * republic of poland * of having any role in those sparse , individual crimes . 
  that 's the `` i do n't have a single clue about the topic i 'm discussing , yet still feel the need to comment for some reason '' fallacy . 
  i know , i used such an example * on purpose * to make a point - if you think the ww2-era republic of poland was in any way responsible for the holocaust , then you know nothing about holocaust either , yet there appears to be an intense media campaign ( which , judging by the usual comments under such articles , seems to have some degree of an effect ) to change the perception of those events into the one where poland is the main preparator , or at least the major accomplice of the mysterious evil `` nazis '' from the moon . 
  in reality , poland was occupied by nazi germany throughout the ww2 , and the only party responsible for various atrocities that were instigated , encouraged or enabled on german-occupied territory , lies on germany . 
  meanwhile , the polish government in-exile , the home army resistance , and the polish underground state treated anyone collaborating with germans against the polish jews as a traitor , and - within their capabilities - provided help to the jewish community . 
  detroit probably has that one good looking street as well . 
  yeah , that was an overstatement , they would usually only kill the entire family that was helping to hide jews . 
   nonetheless , there were poles that participated in the killings . 
  there also were jews who participated in the killings . 
  for some reason i 'm yet to see the intense daily stream of articles like , let 's say , `` sonderkommando auschwitz - the forgotten jewish holocaust helpers '' though . 
  maybe we 'll see fraxit sooner , if le pen wins , 
  such a shame your logic of `` only meps saying stuff i agree with should be paid '' is not an universal rule , considering that as of today * my * tax money still goes into the pockets of socialist and even communist meps , which saddens me deeply . 
  50-60 year old commieblocks still look like utter shit nowadays , so i would n't count on that . 
  the car with camera seems to be driving at around 80-90km / h , which is exactly how fast you are supposed to drive at this type of the road . 
   up to 40 % of the city 's population was ethnically german at one point which means that even at the high point of the germanization of pozna\u0144 , the city remained majority polish . 
   since poland was a test case of the eu to see if massive funding could dramatically improve an economy to justify it if we were a `` test case '' , i wonder what kind of a top secret experiment greece , portugal , slovenia , hungary , lithuania , latvia or estonia must have been in regards to `` massive funding '' then , because each of those countries receives more eu funds per capita than poland . 
  tusk 's term will actually end around a month * after * the elections . 
  1 ) in 2019 2 ) if the current trends will continue , pis will be reelected easily . 
  we * already * were several times more well off than ukraine at the time we joined the single market . 
  also outdated by at least several years , the [ current electoral map looks quite differently .

  imagine the reaction of the trump administration if obama has been chosen to some important international post . 
  that 's pretty much an analogous situation . 
  and how could you possibly know that , considering that you just claimed in your other post that you have n't watched `` a second of public television since kurski took over '' ? 
  jokes aside , thank you for adding other interesting methaphors describing various instances of tvp 's dishonest and misleading coverage , they are almost as strong as my initial comparison of tvp to tvn . 
  sorry , must have missed your earlier post . 
   dude think for a second . 
  if they would proceed ruling according to new legislative . 
  there should n't be any * if * there . 
  all bills passed by parliament are presumed to be legally binding and valid * until * the moment the tribunal rules them unconstitutional . 
  there 's no procedure that would allow tribunal to disregard an oficially binding law * before * passing the official judgement . 
   by that law they should take cases according to date of submission , so that new bill would be judged after many others . 
  kudos to creators of the crappy 1997 constitution , who considered a regular parliament act to be a perfect way to regulate the constitutional court statute .
