   you left out the fact that three generations lie between the first and second part . 
  got ta stop being mad at some point . 
  i am reminded about germany wrecking my homeland each time i walk around my city and notice a curious lack of heritage sites and historical landmarks , and each time i 'm just as mad about that . 
  as for your another example ,  why insist he is polish ? 
  you have all the answers to that question in the very wikipedia article you have linked . 
  i 'll only quote some excrepts :  the poet 's father , miko\u0142aj mickiewicz , a lawyer , was a member of the polish [ 13 ] nobility ( szlachta ) [ 14 ] and bore the hereditary poraj coat-of-arms ; [ 15 ] adam 's mother was barbara mickiewicz , n\u00e9e majewska . 
  adam was the second-born son in the family  finally about october 1830 he took up residence in rome , which he declared `` the most amiable of foreign cities . 
  '' [ 24 ] soon after , he learned about the outbreak of the november 1830 uprising in poland , but he would not leave rome until the spring of 1831 . 
  [ 24 ]  on 19 april 1831 mickiewicz departed rome , traveling to geneva and paris and later , on a false passport , to germany , via dresden and leipzig arriving about 13 august in pozna\u0144 ( german name : posen ) , then part of the kingdom of prussia . 
  [ 24 ] it is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the italian carbonari to the french underground , and delivered documents or money for the polish insurgents from the polish community in paris , but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce . 
  [ 24 ] [ 25 ] ultimately he never crossed into russian poland , where the uprising was mainly happening ; he stayed in german poland ( historically known to poles as wielkopolska , or greater poland ) , where he was well received by members of the local polish nobility . 
  [  in paris , mickiewicz became active in many polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups and published articles in pielgrzym polski ( pl ) ( the polish pilgrim ) . 
  [ 26 ] the fall of 1832 saw the publication , in paris , of the third part of his dziady ( smuggled into partitioned poland ) , as well as of the books of the polish people and of the polish pilgrimage ( pl ) , which mickiewicz self-published . 
   in march 1848 he was part of a polish delegation received in audience by pope pius ix , whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the french revolution of 1848 . 
  [ 36 ] soon after , in april 1848 , he organized a military unit , the mickiewicz legion , to support the insurgents , hoping to liberate the polish and other slavic lands . 
   mickiewicz welcomed the crimean war of 1853-1856 , which he hoped would lead to a new european order including a restored independent poland . 
  [ 37 ] his last composition , a latin ode ad napolionem iii caesarem augustum ode in bomersundum captum , honored napoleon iii and celebrated the british-french victory over russia at the battle of bomarsund [ 37 ] in the \u00c5land islands in august 1854 . 
   he left paris on 11 september 1855 , arriving in constantinoplel , in the ottoman empire , on 22 september . 
  [ 41 ] there , working with micha\u0142 czajkowski ( sadyk pasha ) , he began organizing polish forces to fight under ottoman command against russia . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] with his friend armand l\u00e9vy he also set about organizing a jewish legion . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] he returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on yeni\u015fehir street in the pera ( now beyo\u011flu ) district of constantinople and died on 26 november 1855 . 
  does n't sound in the slightest like the life story of someone who `` should be regarded as belarusian and not polish '' to me . 
   ew months ago i had to argue with couple polish people that trakai castle was not restored by polish seems that in a way , both sides of that discussion were partially wrong , and partially right . 
  the works on restoring the castle started in 1929 after the heritage conservationist sent by the polish state visited the ruins and decided on the restoration . 
  it so happens that its location at the time would be described as troki , wilno voivodeship , republic of poland . 
  during the 30s , ksawery piwocki and witold kieszkowski overseed works on reconstruction , and the main architect of them was jan borowski . 
  it also so happens , that ww2 ultimately resulted in soviet-lithuanian takeover of the region , and afterwards all three of them were resettled to western poland , where they continued to work in the field of heritage conservation for the polish state - that perhaps would shed a bit of the light on the `` 100 % polish '' claim . 
  on the other hand , the restoration works on the castle were * not * finished before the ww2 started , and were continued by soviet and lithuanian heritage conservationists well until 50s and 60s . 
  why , you getting so defensive about it is way too hillarious for that . 
  greetings from westfalen-nordhrein . 
  indeed , i 'd qualify purposefuly writing the historical name with a mistake because one 's butthurt about the correct word order as `` lol so mad '' as well . 
  as i said , more like it 's clear as day he did it because he 's butthurt about lithuania 's lack of relevance . 
  more like butthurt lithuanians changing the commonly used name of a historical country , in process making it look as weird as the examples i provided . 
  see also herzegovina and bosnia or perhaps tobago and trinidad . 
   the lithuanian-polish commonwealth sounds like an entity from the same alternate universe countries such as united kingdom of northern ireland and great britiain , or the hungaro-austrian monarchy would come from . 
  wish we would start a similar programme here in warsaw . 
   do i mention coal anywhere ? 
  you did mention being against nuclear plants , and being against nuclear plants equals supporting building more brand new coal plants to make up for the energy demand . 
  * it 's rather difficult for a pole to comprehend much in russian , even though some words look or sound somewhat familiar . 
  * it 's rather difficult for a pole to comprehend much in lithuanian , even though some words look or sound somewhat familiar . 
  checks out . 
  and yes , lithuanian really looks and feels closer to polish than , let 's say , german or english . 
   but there could be potentially , there could be a `` duty '' to do anything . 
   would not be oppression it would be oppression , as it would be forcing people to do things they do n't want to do under the threat of ransom . 
  a mildly inconvenient form of oppression , but oppression nevertheless . 
  you have a duty to participate in the political process !, 
  there 's no such duty . 
  and personally i * do * participate in the political process ( as in voting , i certainly wo n't waste my time for town hall proceedings ) right now , but if one tried to * force * me to do so , i would fight as a matter of principle to have my liberty to * do n't give a shit about it if i want * back . 
   what 's next ? 
  be required to work to be eligble for benefits ?!, 
  well , if you ask , in my opinion most benefits should be abolished altogether , but that 's a topic for the entirely different discussion . 
   it 's a reference to liberty prime from fallout where the phrase `` democracy is non-negotiable '' is also from . 
  calm your tits . 
  i recognized the reference . 
  it 's just that it was so absurdly irrelevant to the conversation , i could n't help myself but treat it as a serious statement . 
   then do that . 
  luckily , i do n't need to , as at the moment i am not a subject of an oppressive regime you advocate and right now i 'm neither forced to vote nor to attend town hall . 
   communist detected on european soil . 
  i 've been called many mean names until now , being a right-libertarian with moderately conservative worldview , but `` communist '' is a novelty to me . 
  nah , i 'd rather vote for someone who promised to get rid of such nonsense , and then once again enjoy the luxury of not being forced to go to town hall . 
  personal freedom is non-negotiable . 
   it was n't like `` oh well , this pole looks really really aryan , let 's spare him i guess '' . 
  it actually was , during the ww2 over 200,000 `` aryan-looking '' polish children were stolen from their parents for adoption in reich . 
  less than a quarter of them were found and returned home after the war ended . 
  i 'm not sure what the `` political culture '' component of the score was supposed to show , but apparently it 's a metric where we are significantly below such well-known exemplars of democracy as vietnam , china , eritrea , libya , zimbabwe , yemen or tajikistan , and on par with cuba , equatorial guinea , syria or iraq according to the authors of the report . 
   the ussr joined the war after germany invaded them . 
  no , the ussr joined the [ * allied * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii ) side of the war after germany invaded them . 
  on the other hand , ussr was very much engaged in the ww2 for the two years prior to that , it 's just that in 1939-1941 period their various actions ranged from being the third distinct side of the conflict , to open co-belligerence with * axis * powers . 
  besides invading several neutral countries such as baltic states or finland , ussr also invaded one of the three biggest members of [ allies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii ) in europe ( poland ) in 1939 , commiting countless acts of ethnic cleansing and war crimes in areas occupied by them , perhaps most known of which is mass murder of over 20,000 [ allied ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii ) ( polish ) officers executed by soviets in 1940 . 
  not really , wroc\u0142aw has around 100 000 more inhabitants than pozna\u0144 . 
  he used the wrong tense though , they * already * bought off our media and industry . 
   actually polish economy ( together with hungarian and czech ones ) were the strongest from the former communist block not really , actually after [ 40 years of forced communist idiocy poland was on par with romania , and worse-off than bulgaria back in 1989 ] ( https://i.redd.it/8u6emyqxjkjx.png ) . 
  we just had a really good , free-market oriented transition model that allowed us to catch up to hungary ( which was significantly more well-off than poland in 1989 ) , and significantly close the gap on czechia ( which was almost twice as rich as poland in 1989 ) . 
   oh yeah , blame the ussr ... and [ rightfuly so . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/8u6emyqxjkjx.png ), 
   you can store energy from wind and solar ( for example power to gas and battery/heat systems and pumping water to artificial hydro power stations ) and storing energy is both expensive and inefficient , once again making nuclear power more suitable for supplying the base load . 
  i 'm not a wykop user . 
  admiting shortcomings is a good thing . 
  unfortunately your posts are not even close to that , considering that you are blindly shitting on everything poland-related in a style worthy of a russian shill regardless of a topic . 
  they tend to be so overstated , i sometimes even anticipate your posts purely for their comedic value - i 'm yet to see a more perfect ( auto ) parody of a typical self-hating `` enlightened '' pole . 
  please , i 've seen you commenting on reddit for years , and it 's obvious you hate this country with passion . 
  not as hillarious as polish self-hatred though . 
  we are threatened by a certain neighboring nuclear power , thus we need means of nuclear retaliation in case they got an idea to try anything funny against us . 
  the ideal way to achieve this aim would be through our own nuclear weapons programme , but at the moment it 's impossible due to npt signed by our country . 
  as a result of that , the best we can do right now is to rely on alliance with some other nuclear power such as usa ( as well as france and uk ) . 
  nukes for eu would be a logical extension of this policy , and one we would get some degree of control over . 
  no , it simply means that the eu is not going to meet the * paris climate pledges * by 2030 after all . 
   they do n't want their own . 
  actually we do , it 's just that we just do n't fancy facing widespread international sanctions and damaged relations with everyone , which would happen if we withdrew from npt . 
  nah , we have signed a convention against using those as well ( and frankly , i do n't really think developing them would be a good option for us ) . 
  i meant eu-controlled nuclear weapons . 
  so far we are indirectly protected from potential threats by the nuclear capabilities of our american , french and british allies , but one more option would n't hurt either . 
  we are forbidden from developing our own weapons because we have signed the non-proliferation treaty , so i 'm glad we are trying to settle for the second best option . 
  poland yes no , and their combined support would be around 10-15 % anyways no, 
   christ . 
  its always the russians both his flag , and his nick is clearly serbian . 
  glad to see you agreeing that those `` quotas '' are * not * included in the treaties poland have signed . 
  there were no war refugees * asking for * shelter in poland . 
  we have signed no international treaty that would oblige poland to actively import people from countries we are neither neighbors of nor the closest safe country , who not only are not in immediate danger and illegally cross multiple international borders between countries considered safe , but curiously also do n't have even the slightest intention of coming to poland in the first place . 
  it 's a very specific `` right-wing '' party , their worldview in general might be conservative , sure , but their position on economic matters is pretty much anything but right-wing .
