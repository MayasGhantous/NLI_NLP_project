  because the whole of poland is not a part of the warsaw agglomeration/metropolitan area . 
  for reference , [ population density in masovian voivodeship .

  integrating the entire warsaw metropolitan area in a one administrative unit . 
   warsaw is liberal that 's an overstatement as well , considering that pis lost the last parliamentary elections in warsaw by a very slight marign . 
  even within the current borders of warsaw there are numerous districts like praga , wola , wawer or targ\u00f3wek where pis tends to be the most popular party . 
  whatever `` lack of urban planning '' we could have now , it 's still miles ahead of the atrocious `` towers in the park '' principle from commieblock estates . 
  living in a shitty commieblock estate for a prolonged period of time tends to do that to you . 
  how exactly ? 
  yes . 
  likewise if , let 's say , arabs conquered rome in the middle ages , renamed it into alrum , and established their state in a sizable part of the apennine peninsula , it would also remain geographically `` european '' through the sheer virtue of its historical connection to the europe . 
  fewer , shorter buildings result in lower population density , more space wasted , everything being further away , more spread-out city , longer commute times and more time wasted every day for everyone . 
  as a warsaw inhabitant , the city truly changed immensely for the better in the last few decades . 
   part of turkey is european and they are n't christians . 
  a small part of turkey where constantinople , the capital of eastern roman empire ( which was both a christian and european country ) , used to lie before the turkish conquest . 
  thus indeed , turkey has a part of their territory in europe in the same way france has a part of its territory in oceania or south america . 
  it appears that we are walking in circles right now . 
  the very idea of distinctive `` european '' geographical area * appeared * due to a number of common historical factors shared by that area , christianity being one of the major ones . 
   all citizens of a member of the european union have european citizenship . 
  that 's preciesly what i 'm talking about . 
  `` european citizenship '' is a mutually agreed between treaty signatiories addition to national citizenships of european union members . 
  there is no such thing as `` european citizenship '' on its own . 
   it sure does , even if you want to ignore it . 
  just like my usage of the word `` european '' did not magically change between years 2003 and 2005 , even though my country became a member of the international organization called the `` european union '' in the meanwhile , sudden disappearance of that organization also would n't change it . 
   christianity influence on european culture has no influence on being european , because , as you also said , it 's just a geographic definition . 
  and would the current geographic definition of `` europe '' appear without the specific historical circumstances of the region including the common christian religion of its inhabitants ? 
  rather unlikely , as i already outlined in my previous posts . 
   being and european citizens grants you several rights . 
  citizen of the [ member state of the ] european union , not `` european citizen '' . 
   without eu , european is just a geographic description , like american , african or asian . 
  with eu present ( as well as dozens of other europe-specific clubs such as eea , osce , council of europe or perhaps uefa ) , `` european '' also is mostly a geographic description . 
   europe stays in the same place without eu and europeans remain europeans but it becomes a word used simply for everyone born in europe , nothing more . 
  absolutely nothing changes about the usage of the word . 
   not even your wet dreams about `` christian morality '' whatever that might be . 
  the only `` wet dreams '' in this thread are your wet dreams about `` european federalism '' . 
  and christianity was one of the most infuential factor in the development of the european culture and identity for many centuries , and without that influence it would look completely different nowadays , if it even appeared at all . 
  only a fool lacking basic historical knowledge would deny that fact . 
  the `` geographic definition '' is what this word actually means . 
  you can use your definition referring to a specific international organization many european countries happen to be a member of , but do n't expect others to primarily understand it that way as well . 
   but it 's empty and not much behind it . 
  not every word have to be full of great visions and hidden meanings . 
  some words are just plain descriptions with `` not much behind it '' . 
   is like referring to us as earthlings . 
  nah , it 's a bit more specific . 
  it 's specifically referring to the part of the world that throughout centuries had its culture largely influenced by greek philosophy , roman law and christian morality , the part of the word which briefly dominated the rest of the world in one way or another in the late modern period , and the part of the world the white people , who also colonized several other continents , come from . 
  personally , when hearing or writing `` european '' , i tend to think about those three aspects way before thinking of `` european citizenship '' . 
   without eu there is no european citizens . 
  precisely , here is the very problem i pointed out . 
  for one , i do n't tend to think about the `` european citizenship '' in the slightest when i say `` european '' . 
  in fact , when using that term i usually think about the geographic definition . 
  of course there is . 
  stop this ridiculous term appropriation . 
  monarchist symbols at least look nice . 
   btw , in poland i often hear that warsaw was destroyed by them because it was . 
  only a very small part of the city ( mainly old town and the royal route ) was restored to its original state , while the rest of warsaw was turned into the second chelyabinsk with ugly commieblocks spouted everywhere without any regard to the pre-war urban fabric . 
   poland has received billions in eu funds since 2004 [ before 2004 , polish gdp grew just as fast as it did after 2004 . 
   also what happened to poland we got rid of commies in the late 80s , and ever since then our economy has been slowly recovering to the state it would be without their interference . 
   it was meant to integrate the poles and danes into germany , it did n't have any influence abroad . 
  conquer core parts of poland inhabited by poles several decades earlier . 
  attempt to `` integrate '' them into germany through severe repressions . 
  claim that `` it did n't have any influence abroad '' . 
  ( profit ) bonus points : appear completely bewildered about why those poles would possibly hate bismark and the prussian state . 
  they are considered shitty quality cars in eu as well . 
  that 's a `` c '' which for some reason has an inverted ogonek attached to it . 
  there already were quite alright regular roads connecting warsaw with the rest of the country , areas lacking them got higher priority . 
  it 's called [ ogonek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogonek ) you pleb . 
   they were created slightly more than one year ago , just before the elections . 
  so were kukiz '15 or nowoczesna , yet somehow both got into polish parliament with ease . 
  itt : razem shills downvoting everything that is not a hagiography or panegyric of their fringe party . 
  [ does n't seem that far off to me .

  polish army which fought against invading russian , prussian and austrian armies during the wars that encompassed partitions of poland at the end of 18th century , polish troops that escaped to italy after the 3rd partition of poland in 1797 to fight under french command in order to restore the polish state , 19th century polish public figures and politicians as well as countless guerilla warfare and uprisings of polish population against prussian , austrian and russian control of their homeland throughout 19th century had this `` stupid '' way of looking at it as well , but thanks to it our nation survived those dark 100 years . 
  precisely , and just like the red army invaded poland in 1939 , the french army invaded * prussia and austria * in 1806/1808 , thus it should not be counted towards `` invading poland '' dataset . 
   i would be surprised if they had n't been detested by the end in poland as well you are in for a surprise , as the duchy of warsaw was pretty much the only ally of napoleon that stuck together with him until the very end . 
  not that we * liked * the way french troops operated , it 's just that the alternative was losing our country to prussia and russia * again * , which is what indeed happened after napoleon was defeated . 
  actually , \u017beligowski 's action happened over a year * after * czechoslovakia took those border areas from us ( arguably , czechoslovak dick move might have been where pi\u0142sudski got the idea from ) . 
  and you were n't fighting off soviets either back then , quite the contrary , they even gave the city to you two months earlier in exchange for you remaining neutral in their conflict with poland . 
  napoleon was a polish ally . 
  it was a small solace to poles stuck under foreign empires for 100 years that occupation of their homeland was legalized by the congress of vienna . 
  in poland , napoleon armies were considered allies , not invaders . 
  in some parts they were always polish , in some parts many germans used to live there . 
   the prosecutor should be independent of the current government . 
  no , prosecutors should be independent from * courts * . 
  on the other hand , prosecutors office typically comes under the authority of the government , and ( other than brief 2010-2015 period ) that 's the case in poland as well . 
  this way of organization was consistent with all our international obligations before 2010 , and is consistent with all our international obligations right now as well . 
   the fact that the po put that reform in place does not make it inherently a bad reform . 
  and the fact that pis revoked that reform does not it make it a bad decision either . 
  well , by your logic , we also were turning [ `` back in time '' back in 1988 , when the free market was reintroduced in poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ustawa_wilczka ) and the shitty communist reforms from the 40s were revoked . 
  in this particular case though , this `` turning back in time '' was proven a very good decision for our country . 
  there 's nothing inherently bad about rolling back a reform done by the previous government and returning things to how they used to work before it . 
   they actually went rolled back a previous reform they rolled back a reform done by the previous ruling party , which they disagreed with and actively campaigned against . 
  truly an absolutely unheard of situation !, 
   and made the state prosecutor be the same person as the ministry of justice until 2010 , the state prosecutor was always the same person as the minister of justice in poland . 
   i have literally never met a single person in france that is for an eu federation . 
  these people seem to only exist online or in hidden underground echo chambers and gilt ivory towers . 
  same here in poland . 
   masovian rail and that is a very diferent story of 50 year old soviet technology . 
  not all of those are old either , there are lots of masovian railways trains that are modern and brand new as well . 
  well , that 's the most effective kind of propaganda after all - carefuly selecting which facts to use , and which facts to ommit in order to reach a presupposed , one-sided conclusion . 
   everybody was a party member not true , there were only 3 million party members in commie poland out of 35 million country , and those who belonged to the party were universally seen by society with contempt and as opportunistic cunts .
