  well , if we are on that topic , swedes themselves had an [ even better chance to become polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93swedish_union ) at some point . 
  king sigismund made enough mistakes to screw it up though . 
   well i didnt know that . 
  judging by your posts in this thread ( and several other ones also mentioning poland ) , that would appear to be a good summary of your general level of knowledge on this topic . 
  my conclusion is that v4 is free to continue its activities regardles of whether the purpose it was originally formed for was already achieved . 
  personally , i 'd love to see it evolve into a bloc resembling benelux in the future . 
  benelux was formed to coordinate customs union between three countries , and `` lost '' it 's purpose after those countries joined eec , yet deep cooperation within it continues to this day . 
  looks like estonia aspires to be the second iceland . 
  as a response to your edit :  left wing terrorism : it 's because the soviet union was funding it soviet union * was * funding it , which is indicated by the sudden decline of it around the time of ussr collapsed . 
   islamist terorism : it 's because muslims are fundamentally evil no , it 's because * islamist terrorism * , as the very name of it indicates , is a phenomenon exclusive to muslim communities . 
  as a result of that , it so happens that islamist terrorism does not tend to be a thing in countries where muslim presence is negligible . 
   and also there totally never were any muslims in western europe pre 2001 . 
  there were islamist terrorist attacks before 2001 as well , it 's just that the problem with this category of attacks , in contrast to almost all the other categories , got * worse * since then . 
   additionally , the war on terror has of course no impact whatsoever the war of terror was a * reaction * to already existing problem of islamic terrorism . 
  how succesful in combating this problem it was - it 's up to discussion . 
   it 's just that muslims are bad and multiculturalism too . 
  well , that 's a very infantile and simplistic way of wording the conclusion . 
  indeed though , mass influx of low skilled immigrants from the middle east which was a policy pursued by some european countries throughout several last decades appears not to be a good decision in long term , and i certainly hope that the rest of european countries ( including mine ) which did not pursue that policy , will not repeat that mistake . 
  after the soviet-sponsored left-wing terrorism lost its funding after collapse of ussr , and independence movements in basque country and northern ireland decided to settle for more peaceful methods than terrorism , this `` fact of life '' was pretty much eradicated from europe ... and then a new , this time entirely preventable source of it appeared . 
   * becoming * right wingers right-wingers have been the most numerous group in polish electorate for many years ( with around 40 % of electorate identyfying as such ) followed by centrists at close second ( 30-35 % of electorate ) , and left-wingers at distant third ( around 15 % of electorate ) . 
  `` grow ? '', 
  from what i 've seen they pretty much fizzled out after a few days , and were n't particularly large to begin with . 
   yes but in 1938 it was part of poland . 
  in 1938 there also were n't any camps there . 
   well , we did boycott the soviet union into total collapse and watched with glee as it happened . 
  do n't worry , people with misfortune of living in the soviet-occupied half of europe watched with glee as it collapsed as well . 
   eastern european countries are still not as well off well , western europe has a 50 years handicap of having a normal economic system instead of being forced into communist absurdity , of course they are still better off nowadays . 
  you ca n't fully overcome such severe damage within one generation . 
  yes , that 's precisely what hungary ( at least , possibly some other countries as well ) will acknowledge if the procedure would ever reach the council . 
  and because the word got around migrants that that they wo n't be able to pass to their longed-for sweden and germany through greece anymore . 
  the number of migrants entering greece already [ started to decrease ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/sea_arrivals_to_greece_and_italy%2c_2015.png ) even before the deal with turkey was signed , thanks to greece not being an attractive destination anymore after the balkan route was closed . 
   which did shit all to solve the crisis actually , closing the balkan illegal migration route was a prerequisite to solving the crisis . 
   what exactly did poland do to solve the refugee crisis we sent border guards to hungary last year to help them prevent illegal crossings of their border . 
  and council will strike it down . 
  +1 food +1 gold +1 production with railroad, 
  nah , we put all the mountains down south , so the cities located there tend to be in valleys which has a bad impact on air quality . 
  the dot in southwestern poland might be the [ 1971 bombing of opole university hall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kowalczyk_brothers ) . 
  the other dot in southern poland might perhaps refer to the 1979 bombing of the lenin monument in krak\u00f3w . 
  i have absolutely no clue what the third dot could be , as those are the only two events in post-1970 poland i recall that could be broadly encompassed by the term `` terrorism '' , though neither of those incidents resulted in any fatalities . 
  then , there was also a 2010 murder of pis politician marek rosiak by some leftist nutjob in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , but judging by the placement of dots i do n't think it was considered there . 
   did they closed down all the coal power plants for one day to allow this photo to be taken ? 
  all the major coal power plants are located hundreds of kilometers away from warsaw . 
   do they use those giant turbines to clear the air from all the smog in warsaw ? 
  smog is a quite rare occurence in warsaw actually , high air polution is mostly a southern poland thing . 
  [ steadily .

  nah , you should consider yourself `` living in a bubble '' . 
   maybe our healthcare system is too good , because i do n't know anyone younger than 50 who 'd vote for them . 
  well , it seems that you either do n't really know much people younger than 50 , or have a very statistically unlikely set of acquaintances . 
  actually , the regions with highest [ unemployment ] ( http://www.wiking.edu.pl/upload/geografia/images/polska_bezrobocie2010.jpg ) are mostly in northwestern areas that are [ less pro-pis than national average ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mmgyyva.jpg ) . 
   you are mixing the issues here completely , nobody is `` lithuanizing '' or `` localising '' names except that 's literally what is being done - the names are localised , and it 's impossible to use the proper form . 
   in all documents abroad my name is changed to local version , removing '' \u0117 '' and turning it into `` e '' because but , as my example already showed , that 's not the case here - it 's not merely ommiting diacritics , but a way bigger ingerention in the way name is spelled . 
   that 's what countries do , they simply do n't have the letter in the alphabet , it would be equivalent of having a chinese symbol in mid of a name . 
  as i knew someone would try to use this kind of argumentation , i purposefuly used an example with only `` basic '' latin alphabet letters , not even diacritics . 
  this is nothing like `` having a chinese symbol in mid of a name '' , the letter combination `` sz '' or perhaps the letter `` w '' is still included in every possible font . 
   in lithuanian alphabet there is no `` w '' letter . 
  and in polish alphabet there is no `` v '' , `` x '' or `` q '' letter , but if someone happens to have one of those in his name , he is fully able to use it in all his documents . 
  for that matter , common foreign diacritic characters in latin-based alphabet , such as '' \u00f6 '' , '' \u00fc '' , '' \u0161 '' , etc. 
  are also used in official polish documents if they appear in ones name , even though they do not appear in polish alphabet either . 
   now all the localization thing like - as - ai you use is a joke a `` joke '' i am quite often seeing in lithuanian-government approved names of poles living in lithuania when reading some news about them . 
  well , not my fault the very wording you have used in your earlier post happened to be incredibly well fitting as a reply to your comment as well . 
  i only protested you calling the second summary `` better '' , there 's no need to take it personal . 
   this summary is much better https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5iqut4/brief_summary_of_the_current_situation_in_polish/ not really , the summary you have linked has multiple elements showing obvious bias , resulting in pushing strong political views under the cover of `` objectivity '' . 
  `` block '' as in `` parliamentary obstruction resulting in said key vote being delayed for a few hours '' . 
   that they can do . 
  last time i checked , someone called , let 's say , janusz kowalski would be forced to use some ridiculous `` janu\u0161as kovalskaus '' ( or something like that ) alias in all documents issued by the lithuanian government . 
  unless something changed since then - no , they ca n't . 
   this week even our goverment had issues with your statements ( considering lithuanian nationalism as a totalitarian regime ) well , in this particular case , polish governments have been having issues with certain policies of lithuanian government ( namely , forbidding the polish minority in lithuania from being able to use their real names in documents or having bilingual street signs ) for decades by now , it 's just that our current government tends to convey its dissatisfaction in a less diplomatic way than its predecessors . 
   insular and spiteful nation the best part . 
   it 's actually the same this time it 's actually nothing alike this time , polska razem and solidarna polska are much more stable coalition partners than freaking samoobrona and lpr , and if the need ever arisen , there are more than enough kukiz '15 mps as a backup . 
  version 2.0 of what po used to be until a few years ago , but this time with a less competent and less charismatic leader . 
   poland was making it impossible under the constitution . 
  technically , poland , among hundreds of various articles of its brand new constitution , simply included one providing a definition of the term `` marriage '' - a definition which happened to be consistent with the meaning of this term in polish language at the time it was being written . 
  as for reasons for doing that , the constitutional comission of the national assembly was under great deal of pressure to create a constitution that * would * be approved in a referendum - if it was rejected it would be considered both a great prestigious failure , and further prolongation of the very inconvenient legal limbo that was lasting for 8 years by then . 
  ultimately , the only way to realize this objective was to splatter various articles pandering to progressive and conservative voters throughout the project of the constitution , and this definition happened to be one of those focused on the latter . 
  even despite those efforts , referendum was a tossup until the very end , and there was not a chance it would pass if not for them . 
  yes . 
  we were writing our constitution for 8 years ( it was a very divisive and controversial process , and the final product only barely passed in a referendum ) , and it was only finished in 1997 . 
  in the meanwhile , we had two temporary `` small '' constitutions , one between 1989 and 1992 , and the second one between 1992 and 1997 , both very brief and focused strictly on outlining functions of necessary state organs and the process of creating the proper constitution . 
   bulgaria or poland were n't part of urss , for example . 
  but they still had to write a brand new constitution after fall of communism . 
   we eat mostly beef and lamb , so do we , but not during christmas . 
  that 's when traditional carp is eaten . 
   no they were not , that 's the assumption you 're making because you do n't want to accept the very simple premise that education does in fact influence the way people vote , there are multiple studies backing this up and they always show the same thing , these extremist parties are always under-represented in the higher educated social categories . 
  left-wing extremist parties actually happen to be * over * - represented in those social categories , which is certainly a curious phenomenon going against your hypothesis . 
   because if you did you could 've seen for yourself that this holds true whether we 're talking about the us and who voted for trump , or the uk and who voted for brexit , who voted for hoffer , who votes for jobbik in hungary and so on . 
  it somehow does n't hold true anymore when we start talking about the group of extremists on the opposite part of the political spectrum . 
   the poster you were responding to gave absolutely no hint or indication that he wants to brainwash people other than implying that he wants them to change their mind . 
   if you accept his premise , however wrong you think it is , that better educated people vote for these parties in smaller amounts , then it is very easy to see that he did not in fact talk about brainwashing , but about actual education , since there 's already some amount of evidence backing up the fact that education , not brainwashing , does in fact change voting patters . 
  evidence is that educational process in some countries is causing a left wing shift in votting patterns . 
  whether it 's thanks to some special kind of `` critical thinking '' , `` brainwashing '' or perhaps a combination of both is up to discussion , though being a highly educated inhabitant of the big city myself and having witnessed the famed `` educational process '' in person i 'd lean heavily towards the second option . 
   you keep talking about brainwashing people while you fail to understand the very basic nature of the relationship between education and critical thinking . 
  ah yes , the special kind of `` critical thinking '' that will make people more prone to vote for the guys you like . 
   your whole diatribe is based on the completely idiotic assumption that education does nothing to improve one 's critical thinking skills and it 's all just a brainwashing machine . 
  the kind of `` education '' implied by op would certainly be a brainwashing machine , education in general does not neccesarily need to be . 
   nobody was hinting or saying that people need to be educated to vote a certain way or like certain political ideologies , except the guy saying `` we need to make people more ` educated ' to make them vote in a different way they do right now '' at the top of this conversation . 
   it 's about giving people more knowledge and better tools to make decisions . 
  assumption that `` giving people more knowledge and better tools to make decisions '' would lead to them voting for the guys you like , being on the opposite side of the spectrum from the guys they vote for right now , implies a great deal of `` saying that people need to be educated to vote a certain way or like certain political ideologies '' being included in the process . 
   how fucking anti-intellectual must you be to be against that ? 
  the only thing i 'm against here is propaganda targetting eradicating support for certain political views and increasing support for other ones .
