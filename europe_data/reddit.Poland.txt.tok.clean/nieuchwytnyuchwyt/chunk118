  in my country commies pushed their crap through educational system for half of century , causing a great deal of damage - and here we are , three decades later , with some guys on reddit advocating the repeat of the exact same process just with a slightly different agenda . 
   education is correlated with critical thinking . 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  there are many processes which improve `` critical thinking '' a great deal , but the current education system is not among them . 
  even more ridiculous though is the second of your assumptions , namely that `` critical thinking '' somehow leads to voting for left wing parties . 
   you 've basically rejected even the most basic and common sense of assumptions both aforementioned assumptions are anything but `` common sense '' . 
   and replaced them with your own insane assumptions about codespeak and brainwashing . 
  how can anyone still have an argument with you at this point when you utterly reject even the most basic of truths and replace them with conspiracies ? 
  the poster i replied to is literally suggesting brainwashing through `` education '' in order to change political opinions of large chunk of population , and somheow it 's me you are suggesting of `` conspiracies '' , that 's just hillarious . 
   my , how original , yours is only the billionth reiteration of the age old moronic trope that all opinions are equally valid and correct and that the only reason people might make such observations is because they simply do n't agree with them . 
  and yours is only the billionth reiteration of the trope that * your * opinions are obviously more valid and correct than any other ones , and anyone guilty of wrongthink shall be immediately * educated * in a way correcting that oversight . 
   except for the obvious fact that it 's linked to education levels . 
  i absolutely do n't see why would that be the case - there 's nothing `` critical '' about unreservedly accepting everything one 's being taught and conditioned into during one 's education , which is an entirely possible ( and in fact quite common ) outcome of the educational process . 
   no , his statement was a pretty direct and not at all `` veiled '' observation that people with lower education levels and thus weaker critical thinking skills are more susceptible to this new brand of populism that is sweeping across the world . 
  precisely , and this so-called `` new brand of populism '' ( a pretty loaded designation in itself ) , as not consistent with op 's worldview is an inherently worse political position and thus , in op 's opinion , worth eradicating through education presumably consisting of conditioning population against it . 
   yeah , the mindset that people need to think more carefully of the choices they make . 
  the horror . 
  nah , the mindset that voters are supposed to vote in a way that results in a victory of the political groups deemed `` worthy '' by the `` enlightened '' caste . 
  if they do n't , they shall be `` educated '' so as not to make such mistake again . 
   however , you seem to not be able to grasp that ignorance might be more widespread in certain groups than others , an average engineer is quite ignorant about physiotherapy or medieval poetry . 
  an average architect is rather ignorant about quantum physics or organic chemistry . 
  an assumption that mere fact of being * more educated * ( usually in a completely unrelated field ) automatically makes one less ignorant about intricacies of various political theories is laughable at best and utter absurd to me . 
   it 's not just people insulting others for their totes just as legit opinions that they do n't agree with . 
  that 's precisely what i would call the ongoing multiple-front meltdown coming from the part of the political spectrum currently losing ground they seemed to firmly hold for so long . 
   you 're trying to paint people being concerned that a part of the population seems to be easily swayed by these demagogues as something bad not really - the concern here seems to be that a part of the population seems to hold views inconsistent with the ones you hold , and votes accordingly . 
   yeah , because obviously people living in rural areas are all very well educated and posses tremendous critical thinking skills . 
  there are many educated people living in rural areas , and there are many uneducated people living in urban areas . 
  as for `` possesing critical thinking skills '' , that 's not a really a trait depending on a place one happens to inhabit either . 
   surely there ca n't be any truth in what he said , his statement was a thinly veiled version of the condescending `` i dislike that there exist people who have different opinions from mine ( and thus obviously wrong ) , and hope there will be action taken in order to change their opinions to the ones consistent with mine ( and thus obviously correct ) '' mindset that seems so prevalent lately . 
   it would mean that your political opinions might come from a place of ignorance rather than critical thinking . 
  ignorance is neither exclusive to `` rural and low-educated people '' , nor to the voters supporting the part of political spectrum op happens to dislike . 
   we really need more and mass education . 
  too many elections get decided by rural and low-educated people being decieved by populism . 
  `` we really need to indoctrinate people more to assure they will always vote the correct way '' . 
  i like how out of all possible paths between poland and slovakia you have chosen the [ hardest and most montainous one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/rysy_border_slovakia_poland.jpg/1044px-rysy_border_slovakia_poland.jpg ) ... twice . 
  some good news for a change . 
  and razem 's ideas on economy are way worse than anything else in history of poland since the pre-1989 commie party , but that 's unimportant compared to the issue that pis having to rely on coallition partners to have parliamentary majority would result in a very different , less antagonistic and more moderate approach to governing . 
   4.9 % , fuckers have never gotten into and thanks to all the gods for that i see you are a big fan of pis majority being able to do whatever they want on a whim , instead of having to carefuly bargain over every other issue with kukiz '15 or korwin in a fragile coalliton . 
   fascism is a pretty real threat that almost swallowed the whole western civilization . 
  yeah , as opposed to communism , which * actually * swallowed half of europe for a better part of last century . 
  that would n't be so far-fetched either , we actually elected some [ rappers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liroy ) to our parliament . 
  obviously , squatting seems to be a russian thing actually . 
   if they do then we can suspend poland 's voting rights and eu support . 
  nah , i 'm quite sure we can count on at least few more countries than hungary to have our back . 
   you pay for so many things you will never use though . 
  precisely . 
  it 's already bad enough in that regard , no need to make it even worse . 
  of course they were different countries - after all the legitimate polish government was forced to remain in exile in london until 1990 , while for 45 years there was an entirely different puppet entity in charge of governing the soviet-occupied poland . 
  it 's only since the polish government-in-exile recognized the warsaw government after fall of communism that one can speak about continuity between pre-war poland and the current polish state . 
   now when they try to ban it again and all . 
  actually , abortion on demand in poland is already banned since 1993 . 
   have i denied that ? 
  russia at that time was very francophil ` ish . 
  you specifically mentioned that `` being polish back then was different from being polish now '' as if it was some special quirk of `` being polish '' , while actually that 's true for any other nation as well . 
   does n't exclude the fact that plc was ours and your state . 
  indeed , the grand duchy of lithuania after union of 1569 was considered as much `` ours '' as any other part of rzeczpospolita , be it great poland , little poland or perhaps masovia . 
   calling it simply just poland is wrong you asked how it is seen/taught in poland , not whether it 's right or wrong . 
   it was very multi-cultural state created by union of different realms . 
  obviously , rzeczpospolita/pre-partition poland/the 1st polish republic , as we call it around here , was a decentralized and very multi-cultural country , much unlike the current 3rd polish republic which is an unitary state and ethnically homogenous country . 
   by some western countries yay we are western now . 
   besides being polish back then was different from being polish now . 
  of course it was , but then again so was being `` french '' , `` german '' or especially `` lithuanian '' . 
   means republic , not poland . 
  maybe in your polo in polish language , `` rzeczpospolita '' ultimately ended up being a fancy word for ` republic ' used * only * in regards to polish state , while all the other republics are simply called `` republika '' . 
  it 's called `` poland '' ( or `` rzeczpospolita '' , but everyone automatically associates the name `` rzeczpospolita '' with poland anyway ) in history classes as well . 
  sure . 
   from warsaw to bialystok : maybe it 's been upgraded in the last two years - which would n't surprise me ; we have been building a lot of roads . 
  when i drove it in early summer of 2014 it was not a nice journey . 
  well , it 's still being upgraded right now , so in many parts it might not really be a nice journey * right now * , but in about a year or two it will pretty much be a smooth ride all the way from warsaw to bia\u0142ystok . 
   i mostly have been driving around lodz from south to north and vice-versa but have n't gone that route in 9 + months . 
  i heard that they finally opened the ring road around lodz and so maybe that linked up with something from wroclaw . 
  indeed , a1 east of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is now directly linked with s8 from wroc\u0142aw . 
   every few months i drive from krakow to ( near ) lodz and everything from the moment i get off of the a4 ( nearish katowice ) to my destination is crappy even if it is often four lanes . 
  gierk\u00f3wka is indeed crappy , that 's not how you drive from wroc\u0142aw to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a though . 
  and i feel nothing but shame seeing poles such as you , who feel a need to show-off how much they hate their own country and culture on every possible occasion . 
   especially between wroclaw and lodz and then warsaw to bialystok . 
  what ? 
  road from wroc\u0142aw to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is a modern four lane highway on all its length , and warsaw to bia\u0142ytok is mostly a dual carriageway ( though with some parts under construction/maintenance ) . 
   press freedom i do n't know what germans are being told about this particular topic ( as it seems to be a common misconception among them ) , but the situation in poland in regards to * press freedom * remains exactly the same it was for the last 25 years . 
  perhaps many statistics such as [ crime ] ( http://wbdata.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/przestepstwa_ogolem_na_1k_mieszkancow1.png ) or [ unemployment ] ( http://www.wiking.edu.pl/upload/geografia/images/polska_bezrobocie2010.jpg ) have something to do with it . 
  there was a polish minister quite happy about the current huge influx of ukrainian immigrants to poland . 
   here comes the moron who does n't know what genocide means . 
  i congratulate you on such an amazing self-description . 
  using * your own * flag to make a political statement ? 
  i might see the reason behind not punishing that . 
  but vandalizing a flag that someone else put somewhere , especially with an intention of using it as an official representation of the state ? 
  this is obviously criminal behaviour , and should be punished by any state that treats itself seriously . 
  it 's an official symbol of the state , and as such it should be protected * at least * in the settings such as displays on government buildings . 
  you actually [ can ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kara_%c5%82%c4%85czna ) , just not through simply adding all the possible penalties . 
  what a weirdos you are . 
  ideally , they should be charged for both , maybe the property damage should be added as well . 
  with * your own * flag , or with a flag that was flown at the government office that you have stolen ? 
  because in this particular case it was the latter , and i do n't see how a penalty would n't be justified in such circumstances . 
  yeah , seems that the reports about the death of the internal combustion engine have been greatly exaggerated . 
  it actually was the other way around , gemans dropped the `` g '' at the beginning in their horribly butchered pronounciation of the c name . 
  it never was in the first place . 
  `` driving over the speed limit will always be present in every country . 
  women or men will always find a way . '', 
  `` robbery will always be present in every country . 
  women or men will always find a way . '',
