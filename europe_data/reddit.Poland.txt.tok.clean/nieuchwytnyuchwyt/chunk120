  one of the core rules of his sub seems to be that each piece of news about poland shall be posted at least thrice . 
  but it makes it compliant with the international treaties ( teu and tfeu ) our sovereign country has signed . 
  well , it seems that on many accounts eu is already on the stage of the terrible dystopia eurosceptics have been warning about for decades then . 
  poland can also chose to not participate in the flawed quotas system it fundamentally disagrees with , and pay any fines resulting from taking this course of action . 
  the analogy is flawed , because usa is a country , while the eu is an international organisation that has many countries as members . 
  it does make the switch in poland 's position to what it would be since the beginning , had the previous government did not decide in the last minute that they * really * do n't want to win the 2015 elections , rather expected and understandable . 
  ah , must have missed this one . 
  anyhow , it seems that in the same poll the repondents were also asked about which party they would vote for , and po actually won ( which is higly unlikely to actually be the case society-wide ) , so they probably just happened to get a bit more pro-po demographics than usual . 
  the only poll i recall which had tusk winning , the one from late march or early april , had 50.1 % supporting tusk , and 49.9 % supporting duda . 
  this is the one i was referring to throughout this thread . 
   had him winning against duda in 2nd round . 
  had him within a marign of error , with like * one * or * two * people more happening to pick tusk than duda in this particular survey . 
  and it 's a result that did n't even close to being replicated ever since then . 
  actually , tusk has bigger negative electorate than positive one , so he is not really that strong candidate for future presidential elections . 
   so you would suggest adding more letters to our alphabet just so we could read polish names ? 
  pretty much , that 's what poland does . 
  if our systems are perfectly capable of storing letters such as `` v '' , `` x '' or '' \u00f6 '' even though they do n't exist in our alphabet , lithuanian ones would probably manage the complicated endeavour of spwlling `` w '' or '' \u0142 '' . 
   and polish goverment should think what they put on their official documents , meanwhile lithuanian thing is purely internal , polish position on that amounts to being baffled that the poliah minority in lithuania is denied two basic rights that minorities in poland have . 
  i 'm not starting this discussion , i 'm just stating whether or not it is , that 's how most poish tourists visiting it * perceive * it , and the main reason they visit it as torists . 
  tourism to paris and barcelona is not of the `` let 's see the important polish historical heritage sites and monuments that happen to be * abroad * kind though . 
  we have more than enough greenery in the middle of warsaw - ogr\u00f3d saski , ogr\u00f3d krasi\u0144skich , \u0141azienki , pole mokotowskie - and those are all * actual * parks that are pleasant to walk in . 
  the surroundings of pkin to the south and east are anything but pleasant to be in - and that 's putting aside the fact that half of it ( plac defilad ) is a concrete desert so calling it `` greenery '' is rather unwarranted , surroundings of \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie rail station are the worst kind of `` greenery '' - ugly , full of bums and unpleasant to be in . 
  i think the very center of our capital deserves better than be a site of the biggest '' \u017culoskwer '' in the country . 
  i 've been waiting for that to happen since i can remember , and by now i 'm slowly losing hope that we 'll ever get actual city center in the place of this urbanistic tragedy one day but still , i dream that some day it will finally be built over , and look somewhat around [ these lines ] ( http://frw.fc.pl/plac_defilad/images/vision1.jpg ) , or perhaps [ like that ] ( http://images33.fotosik.pl/142/28d58b89676f323e.jpg ) . 
  as a varsovian who sees this terrible waste of space surroundings of pkin are on his daily commute , this looks absolutely terrible . 
  we do n't ? 
  [ look at what we have in the middle of our capital . 
  ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/ymi7mda_/608f88e0fa8b5cc2f41dc90dbf2a9e8d.jpeg ) and the worst thing about it are those endless wastelands around it . 
  yeah , that 's precisely what they did to warsaw . 
  when soviets entered the left bank warsaw in january 1945 , there were around 2 % of buildings and 1,000 people left in the city . 
   but surely you must be significantly reliant on the eu to sponsor your growth if that 's the case they are doing a rather bad job , because we were growing faster in the 90s and before 2004 , than after joining the eu . 
  i mean , those two cities * are * among the two favourite foreign tourism destinations for people who happen to have polish passports . 
  maybe they just happened to understand what the question means . 
  you * are * a citizen of eu on a sole virtue of having citizenship of a country that is an eu member , there is no place for feelings there . 
  personally , i 'm moderately eurosceptic and against further integration , but if someone asked me such question , giving any other answer than `` yes '' would be a sign of terrible ignorance . 
   are you just completely ignoring the fact that you are in the same fucking union than france or germany and not the usa when you gauge which opinion matters most ? 
  as if they are n't completely ignoring that we are in the same union they are , and rarely if ever taking our concerns into account ? 
  and well , usa are * also * among our most important allies , and our relationship with them is crucial to our military security . 
   i have no clue of what you 're talking about . 
  nord stream 2 , among others . 
   the real problem with poland is that for some reasons , they consider that the opinion of the us matter most than the opinion of germany or france . 
  the reason for that is actually quite simple - just like poland is a `` minor power '' compared to germany or france , germany or france are `` minor powers '' compared to usa . 
   i really do n't see the point to not give a shit about the economic problems of germany while being in the same union . 
  but you see the point to not give a shit about germany endangering the energetic security of poland while being in the same union . 
   spain , benelux we are somewhere inbetween the two , as far as power order in europe goes . 
  if * at least * poland fully supports the u.s. new russia sanctions , it 's clearly disingenuous that `` europe '' `` opposes them '' , as if it was an uniform position throughout the continent . 
  at the beginning , the movement of kukiz was pretty much a one-issue , pro-introduction of fptp voting movement . 
  as their structures grew , they turned into a big tent of various anti-establishment , mostly right-wing groups , with the most important link between is that they were all pissed off at the way po ruled until 2015 . 
   the line conveniently cuts off right before the judiciary crisis so i wo n't even comment on that . 
  not really , the background seems to actually not be in line with data - notice how the graph starts in late september 2015 , even though the initial results are clearly from october 25 elections . 
  comparing the data points on the graph , with results of the polls done after the voting ( and veto on ) judiciary bills , it would appear that the graph has been already updated is up to that period . 
   but by god , how can people still support trash like kukiz ? 
  because they are vehemently against po / . n , but do n't really like pis either ? 
  there are a lot of people like that , and for some of them kukiz is close enough . 
  i do n't either , out of all the options currently in the polish parliament , i consider them to be the least bad * by far * . 
  it 's meaningless to expect that the support will magically shift right before the elections in 2019 , that does n't happen really often either . 
  sure , 50 more years of them , and maybe we 'll break even with the damage inflicted on poland by germamy during the ww2 . 
  since when are germany speaking in our name as `` europe '' ? 
  i very much support the u.s. 's new russia sanctions , and i 'm quite sure most poles share my opinion on that . 
  and all those batalions fought on the orders of the ** german ** state . 
  [ yeah , maybe this time around pis + kukiz will mqnage to get a constitutional majority they fell short of the last time around ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/polish_opinion_polling_for_the_2019_election.png ), 
  these people literally have [ `` we hate ** everyone ** '' as one of their mottos . 
  ] ( http://www.24.pl/wp-content/uploads/a604029.jpg ), 
  we get it , only usa truly has `` free speech '' . 
  there were only german death camps there . 
  it 's an extension of the laws against holocaust denial , which i presume is also a crime in germany . 
  ah , i though you meant finland , because estonia is obviously a northern european country . 
  i think finns consider themselves northern european nowadays actually . 
  most of them were removed in early 90s , but there exist a few that were overlooked and remain here and there to this day . 
  funny , because reddit told me that all poles emigrated from poland , while it actually was about one in 20 . 
   have a memorial for that . 
  not for long . 
  they also seem to think there 's a chance that forced migration quotas will actually be enforced , so i would n't take what `` they seem to think '' as a staple of rational prediction . 
  spoiler alert : it wo n't . 
  unlike finland , which lost around 10 % of territory , we lost 45 % of territory ( 30 % if you count the post-german areas we received ) , and had communism enforced upon us . 
  our post-war situation was closer to yours , than to the one finland had . 
  the last time around . 
  on the other side , there is an [ administrative ~ ~ map ~ ~ globe of poland . 
  yeah , your claim that soviets created the finnish democratic republic for shits and giggles definitely sounds very plausible . 
   not saying they did n't help the allies , too , but the winter war is still an allied victory . 
  what about the katy\u0144 massacre in 1940 , when soviet union murdered 22,000 allied officers from the polish army ? 
  do n't you see the inherent contradiction in claiming that ussr was a part of allies in 1939-40 ? 
  i wish poland only suffered such a `` defeat '' to soviets finland did . 
  i 'm quite sure similar is the case for the guys in baltic states . 
   defeat does n't count as a victory . 
  securing your independence against invading soviet fucking union does . 
  not many countries can say they pulled it off . 
  why would it be ? 
  those are the kind of activities i enjoy most . 
   restrained by money and could do literally anything you wanted , you would just ... do nothing ? 
  pretty much . 
  in such case i would probably spend my days sleeping 12 hours a day , and in the rest of the time i would be reading books , consuming entertainment and browsing the internet ( if it still existed ) . 
   no one pays for anything . 
  they take only what they need from those who produce those things . 
  what if noone bothers to produce things they need ? 
  after all , `` everyone is entitled to a good life '' , so why bother doing * anything * ? 
   well , clearly on the photo we see random bunch of people with someone in the back having a folded red square , but that does n't stop you from turning off your brain and shouting `` commie commie ! '', 
  similarly to brown shirts , a `` folded red rectangle '' has a pretty clear connotations in the context of a demonstration , and they are not pleasant ones . 
   and this picture you 're linking now i do n't know what is this supposed to be . 
  no context or whatever .
