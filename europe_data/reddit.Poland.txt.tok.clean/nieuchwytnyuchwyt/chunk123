  yeah , because we were the ones giving the `` assistance '' to ussr after all . 
  as the old saying from the time of soviet occupation goes , we were sending meat to the ussr , and in exchange they were taking coal from us . 
   first of all , no countries are communist - that 's the end goal . 
  it 's the ` fairytale ' you mentioned . 
  second of all , china is a socialist country which has embraced markets , to the tune of yugoslavia , and maybe a bit more . 
  china is a capitalist country , with a one-party government that , as a part of tradition , retains the name `` communist party '' , even though they ditched all the communist policies incompatible with modern world decades ago . 
   modern china is ` more capitalist ' than poland ? 
  how ? 
  how it is n't ? 
  on many aspects they have more free-market and less extensive social spending than we do here in europe . 
   you sure that 's not because of relatively lower costs and size of poland , not because of some polish ingenuity ? 
  good for us . 
  china also builds their capitalism on lower costs and bigger size . 
  what else would you call mass murdering people solely because they were poles ( or happened to have polish-sounding names ) . 
   considering that when poland turned into a people 's republi * was * turned by occupying soviet forces . 
   were doing what they were accused of ? 
  you are a real tankie !, 
  never thought those guys still existed after all these years . 
   j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski was n't a fascist ruler who ruled poland from the end of ww1 until he died ? 
  one sentence , two falsehoods . 
  j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski certainly was n't a supporter of an italian ideology created by mussolini . 
  he also retired from the public life in 1922 , and returned in 1926 , doing a coup after a prolonged parliamentary crisis . 
  so no , pi\u0142sudski did not rule poland for the entire period between ww1 , and his death . 
   and why did they diverge ? 
  for the same reason italian and portuguese , or german and dutch diverged . 
   poland was part of tons of wars , do you really want me to list them all ? 
  of course we were , but those wars rarely amounted to anything . 
  we got most of our pre-partition territory through diplomacy , not conquest . 
   in the jagiellonian period , poland developed as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant landed nobility . 
  feudal lords and the catholic church ( the institution responsible for the spanish inquisition and many other atrocities worldwide ) - that 's your freedom ? 
  about 10 % of commonwealth 's population belonged to the nobility class ( up to 30 - 40 % of local population in some regions like masovia ) . 
  compared to other countries in europe at the time , that was an extraordinary proportion of population enjoying full political rights . 
  going to russian empire 's despotic backwardness was a huge downgrade from that , even if commonwealth 's system for the last 100 years of its existence was terribly dysfunctional . 
   seeing as all of those countries are all european union member states , then i would say quite similar ? 
  well , they are all countries belonging to the western culture . 
  of course they are * kinda * similar . 
   fairy tales ? 
  you think that sort of endeavor if sincere , is done overnight ? 
  the bolsheviks clearly were n't sincere then , because they had 70 years , and by the end of that period they were n't even a step closed to achieving the nirvana they kept promising , than they were at the beginning . 
   so they did n't nationalize private property not a good thing . 
   promote ( and increased ) literacy , electrify the country , which also happened pretty much everywhere else in the world during those 70 years . 
   why is the ` most evil ideology ? ', 
  because out of all ideologies , it was responsible for causing the biggest amount of misery and suffering . 
   because it brought everyone together on the same page , yeah , everyone lived equally shitty and miserable lives under it . 
   china is thriving , and almost everything is made there . 
  china started thriving precisely the moment they ditched the communist policies that brought them disaster after disaster , and implemented capitalist economy . 
   how many products does capitalist poland export internationally , modern china is more capitalist than modern poland . 
  and still , we actually export quite a lot of stuff - furniture , vechicles , machines parts . 
  most of the food sold in other the countries of the region is produced in poland . 
  1/3 of our economy comes from manufacturing , few other countries in europe have such a high proportion . 
   shittier by avoiding the ~ 6 million ( 18 % of poland 's pre-war population ) polish deaths in ww2 ? 
  considering that during the [ 1937-1938 genocide of poles in soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd ) around 30 % of * all * poles who had misfortune of living in this country were murdered only for being poles , i 'm not sure whether our death toll would n't be higher than 18 % of all poles , was the entire polish population under soviet yoke at the time , not only several hundred thousand of them . 
  [ sure . 
   and they are ones taking the hardest beatings do they ? 
  because on the picture i have posted , which has more recent data than yours , they seem to actually be one of the few titles whose sales remained stable year-to-year . 
   do n't they ? 
  they look pretty consistent to me , yeah , we all know that szczecin , pozna\u0144 , wroc\u0142aw , warsaw and pomorze always vote the same way podkarpacie and ma\u0142opolska do , while the rest of western poland consistently votes the opposite way from how large cities do . 
  the `` circenses '' provided to us by both our politicians and eu alike are mildly entertaining , that i have to admit . 
   you made some commitments such as the treaty on european union . 
  and this treaty happens to say that art . 
  7 procedure needs to be unanimously agreed by all the other countries to continue . 
  as a country directly affected by it , we have every right to seek allies who will make the support for it * not * unanimous , and that seems to be the plan at the moment . 
  well , by that logic there are * no * major magazines in poland . 
  will also save us from things like sanctions , major downturn to our economy and rise of anti-eu sentiment . 
  [ it 's the 6th biggest political weekly in poland , ] ( http://static.wirtualnemedia.pl/media/images/2013/images/tygodniki%20opinii%20maj%202017-1.png ) , not really a `` minor magazine '' either . 
  you mistranslated the title , it actually says `` brought '' , not `` bring '' . 
   divide between the more pro-western oriented western poland + large cities , and the more traditonalist and religious eastern poland . 
  this divide continues in many ways since the 19th century sure , sure , now try to explain the geography of [ 1995 presidential elections , ] ( https://www.electoralgeography.com/new/en/wp-content/gallery/poland1995/1995-poland-presidential-second.png ) or the [ 1997 parliamentary ones ] ( https://www.electoralgeography.com/new/en/wp-content/gallery/poland1997l/1997-poland-legislative.gif ) . 
  it was n't that long ago when the big cities in poland tended to vote for the same party * eastern * poland did . 
  so much for your supposed `` centuries-long '' divide . 
  even the [ 2005 parliamentary elections ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/wybory_sejm_2005_barry_kent.png ) do n't really show the pattern you are claiming is so consistent . 
   on the other hand , poland made no effort to recognize the strategic importance of that tiny piece of land and acted in a typical jingoist fashion ( `` must be ours ! '' ), 
  instead of conquering the free city of danzig to control its port and the railroad line connecting the polish coast with the rest of the country , poland built its own railroad around it , and its own seaport in gdynia . 
  and we were a poorer country than czechoslovakia in the interwar period . 
  czechoslovakia made no effort to recognize the strategic importance of picking options other than permanently destroying relations with one of its neighbours through aggressively invading territory controlled by them . 
   the polish participation in the dismemberment of czechoslovakia in 1938 was especially idiotic , given that poland was clearly the next course on the dinner table . 
  historians would probably say the same thing about czechoslovak participation in dismemberment of poland in 1919 , had the polish-bolshevik war that was ongoing at the time ended with soviet victory , and bolsheviks continued their conquest of europe . 
   hungary has even more to lose . 
  precisely - hungary knows that if poland will have their voting rights suspended and will no longer be able to support them , they will be the next in line - and on their own . 
  well , continuing the same line of thought , theoritically it might be possible to invoke art . 
  7 on ten countries at the same time , so they could n't veto . 
  and if * you * read the art . 
  7 of the eu treaty , you would know that it needs to be passed unanimously to take any effect , which is unlikely to happen given that hungary already stated they will support poland . 
  article 7 , point 2 :  the european council , acting by * unanimity * on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 , after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  it might come off as a shock to you , but polish people living in poland are precisely the ones who did * not * emigrate anywhere . 
  he certainly tried to for many years , until he got bored with poles declining the german alliance proposals every time , and changed his plans some time in early 1939 . 
  well , it were czechs who clearly prefered taking that raiload and strip of land ( zaolzie ) from poland in 1919 , to not having a cold war with their northern neighbor . 
  what else was poland supposed to do , congratulate czechoslovakia on invading and annexing the polish-held territory ? 
  kukiz considers pis to be the lesser of two evils compared to po . 
  we already removed most of soviet monuments back in the 90s , now we are removing those we forgot about back then . 
   reconstruction of warsaw . 
  so-called `` re `` construction *  so that these plots are now parks or schools [ or wastelands . 
  there 's literally a whole subgenre of cheap small clothes shops in poland that look and operate in similar way to thrift shops but sell exclusively cheap clothes from we . 
  start making better helicopters and planes then . 
  so there apparently do exist some secret stores in poland where electronics * are * cheaper than in we . 
  could you share where did you find them ? 
  they do . 
  they are called `` cheap english/irish/dutch clothes '' thrift shops . 
   the main difference is that the people of the territories of ukraine/poland/russia spoke the same language and had the same culture for centuries before the formation of those states the latest point at which the west and east slavic languages diverged was around 9th - 10th century , around 1000 years before russian empire encroached on polish lands . 
   is that not how the polish kingdom came to hold onto its ' territory , before those 100 years ?
