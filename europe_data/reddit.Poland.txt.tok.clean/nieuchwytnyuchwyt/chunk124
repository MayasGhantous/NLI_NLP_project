  not through imperialism and conquest ? 
  kingdom of poland came to hold most of its territory not through conquest , but through dynastic inheritance and medieval politics . 
   why should the polish polity be thought of as a ` good ' thing if the tsars ' empire is bad because commonwealth 's system , although faulty , inefficient and not a role model by any means * was * less cruel , offered more freedom to significantly larger portion of the society living within it and was vastly superior on every instance other than providing a strong military compared to the system present in the russian empire . 
   especially when similar cultural groups are being brought together ? 
  poles and russians are not `` similar cultural groups '' anymore than portuguese and romanians , finns and hungarians or swedes and austrians are . 
   what ` threat ? ', 
  the creation of a classless and money-less society , ending exploitation ? 
  such a shame bolsheviks did none of those things . 
  though they certainly spoke of such fairytale while causing countless atrocities and immense amounts of misery , genocide and suffering with their misguided actions . 
  communism truly was the most evil ideology in the history of mankind , and we are lucky to live in times when it was thrown where it belongs - to the dustbin of history . 
   things would have gone differently during and after ww2 if poland rejoined the ussr in 1919 . 
  yeah , in such dark timeline the 20th century would somehow manage to be * even shittier * for poles than it actually was , and that 's a huge feat . 
   they had over 3 % in elections after few months of existence . 
  kukiz '15 and nowoczesna had 8-9 % in elections after existing for a similar ( or even shorter ) period of time , so those 3 % are not an indication of a particularly succesful movement . 
  also , they 've been existing for well over two years by now , yet somehow their support , according to the aggregate of polls done in the meanwhile , has not budged from the insignificant level this party reached `` after few months of existence '' . 
  because our last king abdicated in 1795 . 
   not how it works , especially when we have now proper left-wing party . 
  it certainly is , when said party has support comparable to a statistical error , and is widely regarded as dangerous radicals . 
  it would be seen more like foreign meddling attempts than `` support '' , if anything . 
  it actually used to be significantly different in the 90s - [ can you imagine pomerania , the conservative southeast and the big cities voting for one party , and the rest of the country for the other one ] ( https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_bm6sdagkelhdbtawbcig7wdvmtq3gwqd.jpg ) nowadays ? 
   which poland oviously does n't have since 38 % of the votes got them 51 % of the seats . 
  well , no country with electoral threshold has a proportional system according to your definition . 
  their loss . 
  it does n't matter they are not legal proceedings . 
  if the word gets out that 's how things are in brussels , the already weakened by the forced migration quotas image of eu will only worsen . 
  i 'm certainly disgusted by such pettiness myself . 
  that polish government was voted out a month afterwards , and such shenanigans played a role in the severity of their defeat . 
   polish diplomats will be increasingly ignored or `` mistakenly '' not informed about the informal meetings that come after and before coreper sessions . 
   polish chamber of commerce ( pcc ) or polish trade union nszz solidarnosc will be denied meetings or again , simply be ignored when draftings laws and contracts . 
   when drafting infrastructure and investment budgets the polish interests will be neglected and the once projected money for example rerouted to hungary for a vote in favour of `` real '' sanctions those seem like effective ways to severely worsen the image of eu in poland . 
  if something * worsened * it , it was n't a * cause * of it . 
  actually , it was caused by an unsuccessful attempt to topple bashar al-assad during the arab spring , which turned into a prolonged civil war . 
  history does n't always make sense . 
  treaty on european union , article 7 , section 2 :  the european council , acting by ** unanimity ** on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 , after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  there were more parties back in the 90s , [ to the extent we had 29 parties in a parliament in 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_1991 ) . 
  then the 5 % electoral threshold happened , and after the [ absolutely ridiculous 1993 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_1993 ) , where around 1/3 of voters voted for parties that did not get into parliament , and the ruling coalition got 2/3 seats in the parliament with 35 % of the votes , most of the smaller parties either consolidated , or disappeared . 
   hungary as of now is n't threatened by any sanctions , well , hungarian government appears to have a little bit more of a long term foresight , than you seem to do . 
  here 's a statement from an hour ago : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-judiciary-hungary-iduskbn1a70c1  hungarian prime minister viktor orban said on saturday that budapest would fight to defend poland as the european union threatens warsaw with sanctions over its plans to extend government control over its courts . 
  so much for your claims , armchair geopolitics expert . 
   and for sure wo n't be if they support the eu comission procedure against poland . 
  yeah , they 'll give orban a word that no matter what he 'll do from now on , there will never ever be any procedures or sanctions started against hungary . 
  not now , not in next year , and not in 5 years . 
  because that 's totally how this works . 
   given that orban did support donald tusk 's candidature against pis tusk 's candidature did n't need to be voted in unanimously to be passed . 
  there was no bargaining power there . 
   it 's only logical to presume he wo n't hesitate to show his commitment to the eu rather than poland once again . 
  hungary will do what benefits hungary , and in this particular case , it benefits hungary immensely to have backup in the form of poland eager to block any action that could hurt hungary . 
   he will go with his country 's economic interest precisely , and it would be against hungary 's interest not to block any attempt to suspend voting rights of the only country that is guaranteed to block any attempt at suspending hungary 's voting rights . 
  treaty on european union , article 7 , section 2 :  the european council , acting by ** unanimity ** on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 , after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  as long as hungary is present in european council , never . 
  if controlling state-owned media was all it took to guarantee high support , po would never lose both 2015 elections . 
   was behind the iron curtain for centuries a little bit less than half of century , to be exact . 
  it actually was way higher in 1993 , where 33 % of voting electorate ( around 4.5 millon votes ) , mostly several right-wing parties that got 3-4 % each , had no representation in the seats . 
  coincidentally , it is also the parliament which have written the 1997 constitution , with the sld - psl coallition having 2/3 seats in parliament despite receiving only 35 % of the votes . 
  the current parliament is not even the most disproportionate parliament after * 1989 * , let alone in history of poland in general . 
  good luck to them then , they will need lots of it . 
  yes it is . 
  at least for the last 1000-2000 years there were three large regions of dense human population in the old world , with roughly similar population , and each making up around a fifth to a quarter of the entire world 's population . 
  those three regions were europe , india and china . 
  most of the remainder lived in south-east asia , with roughly 5-10 % living in africa and several percent in americas . 
  african share of global population is already on anomalously high levels never seen since prehistory , and it 's only going to get worse in the future . 
  it 's already quite obvious that this continent has a hard time sustaining even its current populations , and even the * optimistic * projections have it at least triple its population within the next century . 
  i do n't understand where your optimism is coming from , because it 's like watching a catastrophic crash unfold in a slow motion . 
  europe consistently had several times the population density of africa at least since the ancient times . 
  the natural environment in europe allows for much higher average population density than in africa , where half of continent is either a desert or a tropical rainforest . 
  good . 
   how many political programs were there then in tvp ? 
  if i remember correctly 4 - po\u015bpieszalski , lis , ziemkiewicz , wildstein . 
   how is 50 % tokenism ? 
  po only really took over tvp after komorowski became president , whih allowed them to get majority in krrit . 
  and coincidentally , wildstein 's program stopped being broadcasted in 2010 , ziemkiewicz 's program ended soon afterwards , in 2011 . 
  so much for your `` 50 % '' - ever since po took over tvp , it was pospieszalski 's program which was the sole token non-po propaganda - which is what i was talking about in the first place . 
   now we can argue that po had no reason to take over public media because it had tvn . 
  oh , it indeed was the case , and so they had no need to take over tvp so swiftly and so blatantly pis did . 
  nevertheless , nearing 2015 tvp somehow managed to become much worse than tvn , and by the time elections came it was on a firm trajectory towards reaching bias levels comparable with the currently existing ones . 
  and as long as tvp remains state-owned , this pattern is going to repeat over and over again no matter who will win the elections in the future . 
   and by `` more subtle propaganda '' you mean they paid for programs prepared by opposition supporters that were criticizing them . 
   yeah ? 
  show me similar level of propaganda from 1990-2015 . 
  the fact that other governments might have been more subtle with their propaganda and bias in state-owned media does n't make them any more of `` public media '' . 
  that 's why i 've been a supporter of privatization of tvp for a long time . 
   my great-grandfather was killed in action at wwii protecting those people . 
  and my great-grandfather was murdered by soviet occupants as a result of their 1939 invasion of poland . 
  in poland large part of families have someone who was deported to freeze in siberia , worked to death in a gulag , or outright massacred or executed by soviets during the ww2 , it 's a very sensitive topic for us . 
  `` transformed '' is a huge stretch , they always were state media first and foremost . 
  good , a shame we had to wait for so long after the soviet occupation ended for it to be passed . 
   what is he/they blamed for ? 
  completely failing to fulfil his/their electoral promises from 2007 , in many instances doing the exact opposite . 
  as a matter of principle i will never support po or tusk again , whoever would they be running against . 
   fuck up another union . 
  more like let 's prevent an union we somewhat like from becoming fucked up . 
   btw , here 's an actual commonwealth of independent states you might want to join . 
  for the same reason joining asean or african union is not particularly high on our wishlist , neither would be joining this one . 
  we are also free to do everything in our power to stop federalization and keep the eu as a economical-political alliance of independent countries . 
  the pipeline goes through romania and bulgaria , so it does not pose the same risk of cutting off the region from gas the direct russia-germany line ns2 is does . 
   how many times does poland has to play the international political scene until you finally get it : it does n't pay to be a vassal . 
  while neither option sounds particularly thrilling , it 's better to be a vassal than not exist at all . 
   you 're not even sure what you have to lose oh , i 'm actually quite sure about that , that 's why i do n't want to lose it . 
   can only discuss the option through grim hyperbole to avoid actual thought . 
  i wish that was a hyperbole , alas that 's only one of the least bad scenarios .
