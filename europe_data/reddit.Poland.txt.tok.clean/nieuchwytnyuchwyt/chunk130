  german newspapers ca n't spell polish names for shit . 
  it 's as if they consider it a point of honour to have half of the names horribly butchered every time they write an article about poland . 
  if they ca n't even be bothered to check the spelling with simple googling , what else they did n't bother to check ? 
  seems that we were ahead of the times then , as we already had a system that required a `` broad parliamentary consensus '' to do anything - in 17th and 18th century , and it was called `` liberum veto '' . 
  sadly , such system resulted in a state that was very dysfunctional and ultimately got destroyed by its neighbors . 
  well , it apparently even has the `` controversial '' marking now for some reason . 
  did n't hear from any media about this protest either , but as a varsovian i certainly noticed that those guys have been protesting there for at least the last few months . 
  frankly though , i had no idea what that protest was about until i read this article . 
  it is - the polish government broke the earlier agreed stance of v4 on this issue in the last minute - and it got ousted . 
   did n't poland break ranks with the rest of the v4 on the mandatory distribution quotas , i do n't know if you noticed , but that decision was seen * very * badly in poland , and it is one of the reasons why poland has a government from a different party nowadays . 
  does n't really matter eighter way , as i do n't think v4 wants romania to join it . 
  effective at making flags of poland and malta identical i guess . 
   right-wing was n't he a left-wing terrorist actually ? 
  because i recall the exact same amount of sources proclaiming his political affiliation you have cited - zero . 
  we have always called bohemia `` czechy '' anyway . 
  it 's still nice to see usa doing an action that is helping us even when they were not explicitly trying to do so . 
  i would consider yet another instance of usa proving itself to be a way more reliable ally of those countries than germany to be actually quite related to that . 
  does not ? 
  quite the contrary , a lot of european countries would be very pleased if the us sanctioned the shit out of nord stream . 
  usa would once again prove itself to be a way more reliable ally than germany . 
  87 % of britons are white , so with 5 random police officers in the picture , assuming distribution proportional to the british population , there would n't be any * poc * ( this term is such an an americanism ) in such picture around half of the time . 
  * volenti non fit iniuria * is also an important cornerstone of our legal system . 
   people saved they embark on the journey out of their own volition , and fully knowing that after a few kilometers there is a very good chance will be able to transfer ships from unsafe illegal human trafficking vessels , to the safe legal human trafficking vessels . 
  those organizations should be treated the same way human trafficking gangs are . 
   what is bad about it ? 
  pushing the failed forced resettlement programme despite overwhelming opposition to it in many european countries ? 
  personally , i hope we will not back down on that one - and if it will come to it , as a matter of principles i prefer us paying fines rather than surrendering our opposition to participate in this shitshow . 
   and upholding of democracy . 
  as for the second part , this one is not really a concern as it is not going anywhere due to the procedure needing to be passed unanimously on one of the later stages , which wo n't happen . 
  and frankly , the only way i can see this issue being called `` upholding of democracy '' is if by `` democracy '' you mean `` the correct party is supposed to win '' . 
  what ? 
  black hawks * are * better suited to the kind of special operations polish army plans to use them for , compared to larger , slower and less maneuverable caracals . 
  the renovation of boulevards took forever to finish , but it really was worth it . 
  with the way comission is doing about now , if anything there is a potential for a change to a * more * eurosceptic stance in the government policy . 
  most poles certainly do n't leave anywhere ( in fact , it 's swiftly approaching the point where it wo n't really be worth it at all ) and instead we are doing a pretty good job around here in rebuilding our economy from the third world shambles it was in 1989 thanks to 40 years of socialist idiocy forced on us by soviet occupiers, 
   yes you lost some lands to the east but you gained german lands to the west and north which worth a lot more than what was lost . 
  they were completely ruined after the war , and on top of that russians stole most of the remaining stuff that was worth anything . 
  except for silesia , which actually has some useful natural resources , areas received by poland in 1945 are below polish average in terms of [ unemployment ] ( http://www.bruksela.opolskie.pl/data/other/02.2012.gif ) and [ wealth ] ( http://docplayer.pl/docs-images/25/5279558/images/16-0.png ) , behind the areas that were in pre-war western and central poland . 
  so much for their `` great value '' . 
   also having a coast is tooo important . 
  we had a coast before the war as well . 
  in fact , excluding gda\u0144sk which was a free city before the war , the only part of the polish coast that is of any economic importance nowadays , was already a part of poland before the ww2 . 
  we built the port of gdynia in there during the interwar period , and it remains the most important polish port to this day . 
   you even went beyond the river border and annexed stettin , a town which used to be almost exclusively german . 
  i 'd a hundred times prefer us having kept either lw\u00f3w or wilno after the war instead of getting stettin . 
  i 'll take that as a compliment .

   lands belonging to prussia are now polish . 
  and the eastern part of pre-war poland was annexed by ussr in 1939 . 
  those lands now belong to ukraine , belarus and lithuania . 
   i mean just before ww2 you had less lands , no , before the ww2 we had * more * lands than we have now . 
  even with post-german lands , due to ussr annexing parts of poland on the east we were still almost 1/3 smaller post-1945 than we were before the ww2 . 
  [ map for reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/linie_a-f_ang.png ), 
   its not actually that small its just has a weird shape . 
  yeah , i see it now , especially the long and narrow part in the north . 
   ( thanks to ww2 ) in what way ? 
  poland suffered immense losses during ww2 , and it was bigger in size ( by 77 000 square kilometers ) , as well as comparatively bigger in population before the ww2 than it is nowadays . 
  in 1939 poland ( 35m ) was closer in population to france ( 40m ) or italy ( 44m ) than to much smaller spain ( 25m ) . 
  nowadays , spain ( 47m ) has almost 10m people more than poland ( 38m ) . 
  when you add all the islands , sure . 
  but the mainland part is surprisingly small , as is evident from this picture . 
  everytime i see your comments in here , i see why many europeans think of americans as complete ignorants . 
  well , i have always seen belgium and the netherlands to be comparable in size to the bigger polish voivodships . 
  greece on the other hand , i have always perceived to be a middle-sized country . 
  s-70i black hawk ( us ) h225m caracal ( french ) aw149 ( italian ), 
  while there were advanced talks with the french producer , the deal was n't concluded by any means at the time the polish army decided they like the american offer more after all . 
  * smaller * faster * more maneuverable * cheaper per unit * better suited for the tasks polish army actually expects to use them for . 
  the french were surely giving poland a lot of shit when our army has recently decided to pick its new helicopters on quality instead of `` european unity '' , and chosen the american helicopters over the french ones . 
  seems that greece is smaller than i thought . 
  i would n't be so fast ( though i 'm aurely getting less and less enthusiastic about our membership in this international organization ) the nature of eu stuff is a * facultas alternativa * - either follow it , or pay fines . 
  well , in this particular case i 'll gladly take paying fines . 
  so forced migration , because a country can be * forced * into it despite its objections . 
  i surely hope my country will rather pay whatever fines are imposed on it ( and not without a long legal battle first ) instead of succumbing to this dictate . 
  it 's about setting up a precedent that forced migration is possible , not about any particular number as of today . 
  why should it , if others clearly do n't care about it either ? 
  it 's not like nord stream is an issue that appeared recently , it 's been around for more than 10 years already . 
  that is , if left-wing circlejerk full of propaganda and a polish-language version of infamous / r/politics is what you are looking for . 
   most of the refugees signed up to fight in the new polish army also , iran * was * the first safe country for poles escaping the soviet union . 
  there 's no need to * convince * the population about it considering that polish population was vehemently against the idea of forced migration quotas since its very inception . 
  would n't be so sure about that , poland 's ministers have [ already said that they would rather pay fines than allow to be forced to take migrants . 
  ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/307297,forced-relocation-of-refugees-worse-than-eu-penalties-minister ), 
  we have polish names for pretty much every major german city . 
  [ i have a chart that will be good enough for now . 
  post one about poland 's transition to capitalism next . 
  and i think they did a great job - that 's certainly the best designed from scratch new district of warsaw since at least 40-50 years . 
  fortunately developments that return to urbanist principles of pre-war warsaw instead of compromised ideals of le corbusier are becoming more and more common in various parts of the city . 
   there are no profits , instead we tax payers have to pay a lot to manage those museums . 
  you can always return them back if it 's such a burden . 
   ever heard about period of limitation ? 
  does not really apply to international law . 
   it 's your claim canada is safer . 
  and it 's your claim that sweden is safer than poland . 
   they belong to humanity , does n't matter where they 're on display . 
  of course it does matter . 
  it 's sweden which earns profits from being in possession of this polish cultural heritage as of now . 
  and it 's sweden which promised poland in the 1660 peace treaty to return all the valuables they have plundered , which they are yet to fulfil until today . 
   they 're safer in sweden , trust me . 
  they would be even safer in , let 's say , canada than they are in sweden . 
  why do n't you ship there all the exhibits from your museusms , you know , just to be on the safe side .
