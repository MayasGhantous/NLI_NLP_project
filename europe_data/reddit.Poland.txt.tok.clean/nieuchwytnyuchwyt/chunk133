   and you also got back maramures , which is 80 % romanian and has always been majority romanian . 
  which differs from romania getting szeklerland , which is 90 % hungarian and has always been majority hungarian exactly how ? 
  whichever way you drew the borders , you would either end up with hungary with a romanian part in the middle ( 1940 borders ) , or romania with a hungarian part in the middle ( 1920 and 1945/7 borders ) . 
  do n't see how either option is inherently better in any way than the other one . 
   really , that might be true for the americas but not modern day europe . 
  yeah , this new world concept also got popular in * parts * of modern-day europe due to combination of legacy of their own colonial empires , and heavy influence of usa ( which is a prime example of a country with such concept of nationality ) on european culture . 
   learning the consequences of nationalism the `` consequences of nationalism '' in our case being preservation of our culture , and our nation and society surviving despite suffering over 100 years under the hostile foreign rule . 
   ensuring the promises of equality of all before the law our system does that just as well - all polish citizens are exactly as much polish citizens . 
   your conception of an ethnic chauvinism is still rooted in outdated view on the human condition . 
  it 's not chauvinism , because all polish citizens are threated exactly the same in the eyes of the polish law regardless of whether they are polish , ukrainian , martian , or all of the above . 
   there 's nothing more of cultural appropriation than that view of thinking that people who are polish are less of it because they do n't make part of the ethnic majority you do n't even understand what `` cultural appropriation '' is . 
  it 's taking a concept from a foreign culture ( in this case , the new world , immigrant societies oriented concept of nationality ) and applying it verbatim to some other culture despite vastly different circumstances . 
   they have every right to claim poland as their country too . 
  yes , they are as much of a polish citizen , as any other polish citizen is . 
   again ethnicity does n't matter a thing , even if they feel it does . 
  of course it does n't matter , their polish citizenship is worth exactly as much as any other polish citizenship regardless of whether they are polish or not . 
   but the modern western conception of nationality and ethnicity ( that i agree with ) passed well beyond the positions you seem to believe in , it 's at a stage where ethnicity does n't have any legal and ideological meaning . 
  it 's a concept of nationality steming from history of post-colonial societies in new world . 
  we have our own concept of nationality , which is related to ones culture and ethnicity , and a separate concept of citizenship . 
  changing this well-established concept steming from our historical circumstances into some alien and foreign concept would be the worst kind of cultural appropriation . 
   that 's why they are polish like ethnic poles . 
  some of them are , and some of them disagree with you . 
  the exact proportion also being polish varies in each ethnicity . 
   no , this whole conversation is how apparently some polish users do n't understand that the ethnic make up of modern societies is n't in any mean linked to ethnicity . 
  more like this conversation is how some users from a country where concepts of `` ethnicity '' and `` nationality '' apparently seem to have a significantly different meaning , do n't understand that the rest of the world is not a carbon copy of their country . 
  poles who lived under the partitions were n't `` german '' , `` russian '' , or `` austrian '' , despite having german , russian or austrian citizenship , they were polish . 
  ukrainians who lived in the interwar southeastern poland were n't `` polish '' , despite having a polish citizenship , they were ukrainian . 
   that 's why they are so vehemently denying that there are roma who happen to be polish obviously there are romani who happen to be polish citizens , just like there happen to be belarusian , lemko or silesian people who happen to be polish citizens . 
  what 's even more interesting is that by far the most numerous group among people who happen to be polish citizens , encompassing almost 99 % of them , are people who happen to be polish . 
  interestingly enough , some of them happen not to be exclusively polish - that number also includes a portion of polish citizens who happen to be * both * ukrainian and polish , * both * kashubian and polish , or perhaps * both * silesian and polish . 
  you can easily find more detailed data on that in the various polish censuses i already sent you several posts ago . 
   their ethnic affinity is irrelevant . 
  but `` polish '' * is * an ethnic affinity . 
  that 's the entire point of this conversation . 
   nowadays the only thing that can decide who 's polish and who is n't is the polish state , and due to it 's non discriminatory citizenship [ counterexample ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) - an official document confirming a person to be `` polish '' , in spite of not having a * polish citizenship * . 
   people of different ethnicities are polish , what 's the counterexample ? 
  no , the article clearly states that people of different nationalities are polish citizens . 
  there are over half million of * polish citizens * who are not `` polish '' , as claimed by themselves . 
  [ counterexample ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_minorities_in_poland#demography )  if you want to refer to ethnicity then you have to specify . 
  it 's the other way around in polish language . 
  if you want to refer to citizenship , you have to specify . 
  that 's obviously incorrect , it 's not even internally consistent . 
  in english language terms ( which differ from the polish language terms ) , `` polish '' is a description of an ethnicity , `` polish citizenship '' is a description of a nationality . 
   and the only answer to that is people who have citizenship from poland . 
  not really , as with such definition you are excluding a quite numerous number of people who are polish but due to various historical circumstances such as border changes or deportations do n't have a polish citizenship , as well as including a perhaps less numerous but still significant number of people who do n't consider themselves to be `` polish '' in the slightest . 
  glad we seem to have reached some kind of an agreement then . 
  to reiterate my point - there are more poles than there are polish citizens , yet at the same time not every polish citizen considers himself to be a pole ( in fact , many of polish citizens not considering themselves `` poles '' would be offended if you tried to convince them that this is the case ) . 
  no , [ `` polish citizen '' means `` polish citizen '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_poland#nationalities ) , and [ `` polish '' means `` polish '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles ) . 
  how could it be an `` outdated belief '' when citizenship ( `` polish citizen '' ) and ethnicity ( `` polish '' ) are obviously two different things . 
  you can be polish without having a polish citizenship . 
  you do n't seem to understand my only point either , namely that being `` polish '' and being a `` polish citizen '' are two separate concepts , though more often than not they tend to be the case simultaneously . 
  not really , the relation of the concept of `` poles '' to the concept of `` polish citizens '' looks more like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/diagrama_de_venn_1b.png ) . 
  there are both poles who are n't polish citizens ( for example , a significant part of the polish community in countries such as kazakhstan , ukraine or lithuania ) , as well as polish citizens who do n't consider themselves `` poles '' ( according to the 2011 polish census , several hundred thousand of polish citizens ) . 
  polish * citizens * . 
  not really , as there are many poles who are n't polish citizens , for example a better part of the polish community in countries such as lithuania , kazakhstan or belarus . 
   your blindness is staggering . 
  pot calling the kettle black . 
  poland is n't really `` dependent '' on eu funds in any major way either , it 's just that all the other countries on a similar level to poland also get them , so us opting-out of eu funds would give everyone else an edge of unfair advantage over us . 
  hopefuly that oversight will be corrected , and all the other violations will be also included on this `` reasons for cutting funds '' list . 
  i hope they 'll cut funds to everyone , because i 'm tired of using them as a blackmail tool . 
  oh , wait , that 's already going to happen with the 2020 eu budget anyway . 
  not for long , the 2020 budget wo n't be even close to being as generous as the 2014 one , and it 's been known for many years . 
  there were public protests in poland before 2015 as well . 
  actually , there is a significant number of scientists supporting localized logging as a viable form of preventing further spread of bark beetle infestation . 
   yeah preservation of piece of nature untouched by humans . 
  there already was a lot of logging done by germans in the bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest during both world wars , so if this is the specific thing you are so worried about , i regret to tell you that it already happened long ago . 
   can tell you that a lot of pis loyalists are brigading mine and other submissions one could also say that you are brigading this subreddit with your anti-pis comments and submissions . 
  flags of [ various international organizations poland is a member of ] ( http://static.prsa.pl/images/7c06ed47-6065-4963-bce1-45991fe34a7a.jpg ) are still flown in the presidential palace in addition to the polish flag , depending on a particular occasion . 
  i 'm sure there will be an eu flag when some eu dignitary will be visiting the palace . 
   okay , there 's the eu flag it 's an old photo . 
  the quality of this photo makes it look a bit like a render from some late 90s video game . 
  there are no un , nato or oecd flags either . 
  it 's now more difficult for their national hockey , football and other sports teams to be title contenders in international tournaments . 
  more like centre-right , and anyhow a party like pp would probably be considered centrist in poland . 
  the three other major parties are all various shades of left wing to centre-left ( and podemos would be bordering on far-left , if it was a party in poland ) . 
  there are n't many `` socialist-communist voters '' in poland , for rather obvious reasons . 
  for the exact same reason right wing parties do n't thrive in spain . 
  i would n't really call it * american * , it was ( and still is ) seen as the `` evil empire '' here in poland , and i presume the situation is similar in much of formerly soviet-occupied part of europe . 
  well , he was born in warsaw and had a polish citizenship . 
  anyhow , brzezi\u0144ski received the order of the white eagle , which is the highest polish order , as well as the honorary citizenship of many polish cities such as przemy\u015bl , gda\u0144sk and krak\u00f3w . 
  he was a big supporter of poland 's membership in nato , as well as of locating the missile shield bases in poland . 
  he visited poland quite often , attending various events or giving some speeches , and throughout the years i have read many articles written by him in polish press and on polish portals , though many of them might have been reprints from the american press . 
   analyses freedom of press and has not criticized the developments in poland could you perhaps lift the veil of mystery and share with us what are those mythical `` developments '' in regards to press in poland you keep talking about ? 
  because as someone regularly consuming wide array of polish press for many years , i have not noticed any significant changes in one way or another recently . 
   i know so little because i 'm living in poland with my polish wife . 
  if you actually did , you certainly would n't spout such bullshit in this thread , as you would clearly see that there were absolutely no changes in regards to how press in poland operates during the last two years compared to how it operated in the earlier period . 
   their freedom of press is comparable to african country now til italy , uk , south korea , usa , japan and greece are `` african countries '' . 
  those poles who know about brzezi\u0144ski , usually have a positive attitude towards him thanks to his firm anti-soviet stance during the cold war . 
  why on earth would being thankful for helping to defeat soviets a `` sarcasm '' ? 
  so only a week shorter than france , and that 's without help from the british expeditionary force , major fortifications on the border , and while being attacked by * both * soviet union and germany . 
  there is no eu constitution , and the last time there was an attempt to create one , people voted against in in referendums . 
   recent polls show that poles are happy with our current constitution and referendum is most likely to fail that 's interesting , because i 've seen a more recent poll showing the exact opposite result - http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/sondaz-ibris-polacy-chca-zmiany-konstytucji/kezdy87 ( ibris poll from may 2017 : 61 % yes , 36 % no ) i guess it all depends on the way the question is worded . 
  i 'm glad you were able to recognize a hyperbole in the very comment you just replied to then . 
  well , considering that the only conclusion one can infer from this conversation is that poles clearly do n't count as humans according to you , i 'm quite sure i actually was better off without knowing about your bigoted worldview . 
  cyprus, 
   on websites who no one knows about til the 11th most visited website in poland ( and the 3rd most visited news portal ) is a `` website noone knows about '' . 
   which is not an eu court, 
  since being around as far east as poland or hungary , and further east than czech republic or slovenia ? 
  that 's why `` northern europe '' , or `` scandinavia '' is usually used to refer to it . 
   so you propose that your country ( poland ) will take all the benefits and eurozone is supposed to helping poorer south on its own are you tacitly implying here that it 's more beneficial to stay out of it and joining eurozone is actually a hindrance , but a hindrance all eu countries should suffer for `` greater good '' ?
