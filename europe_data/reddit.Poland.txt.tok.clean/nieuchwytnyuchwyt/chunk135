   every countries that did ` nt understand that the interest of another eu country has to be more favoured than the interest of a non-eu country completely missed the point . 
  my my , seems that we have gotten ourselves into some really toxic union then . 
   in 2003 , poland 's gdp was 192 billion euros ; a decade later it was 396 billion euros . 
  it 's worth to add that poland 's gdp in 1993 was around 90 billion dollars , so it would appear that the growth rates simply remained quite constant throughout this 20 year period . 
   then , what 's the point of public broadcaster ? 
  why should taxpayers fund government propaganda ? 
  let them only have private media and everything would work the same way as you wrote , with more money saved in the budget . 
  yes , that 's basically what my position is . 
  i think i already mentioned it a few posts ago . 
   the way you put nato on the same degree of importance than the eu explain everything . 
  not really , i actually consider poland joining nato in 1999 to be a * much more * fundamental event from the standpoint of our national security , than poland joining the eu in 2004 . 
   the people that write the news are not somehow brain-controlled by the owners , though . 
  if there 's a proper free speech and culture of unbiased reporting , i can trust that the reporter tries to be fair and writes stuff correctly . 
  of course , if there are some issues with the company itself , they most likely wo n't cover them or cover them biasedly . 
  but the owners might not allow the news to go through , if they wo n't follow the standards envisioned by them . 
  that 's why the news-writing people with certain political views will ultimately gravity towards working for news outlets with similar political views , and when the ownership of a certain news outlet changes , its staff will sooner or later become gradually replaced to better reflect the newly introduced line . 
  and it 's on that level , where it 's important to have free speech - namely , that anyone should be free to open his own news outlet , having whatever bias he pleases ( or `` no bias '' , if he wishes so , but such news outlet is yet to be seen ) . 
  and on that level , it works very well in poland - you can find newspapers , internet portals , radio stations or tv stations slanted towards , ranging from `` barely '' to `` heavily '' , pretty much any worldview imaginable . 
   but what i meant is who would be going swapping channels and then trying to put something together from propaganda pieces ? 
  if that 's how it works , i just would n't watch them at all . 
  but that * is * how it works , and that 's what you * are * doing all the time whether you like it or not . 
  if you want your news free of propaganda or biases , your best shot is reading the dry news releases from news agencies , free of any external commentary , and even that would n't be a 100 % method . 
   but ... why would you watch news if they are known to be some one-sided propaganda ? 
  precisely , `` why would you watch tv news ? '', 
  is a question i 've been asking myself for many years as well . 
  anyhow , the news tend to follow the biases of the owners of a news outlet , and it 's healthy to keep that in mind while consuming them . 
  there 's no such thing as `` unbiased news '' . 
   i 'm definitely not going to watch some 2-3 differently biased propgrams and then hope that i 'll go for the golden midway and get the truth . 
  but you * need * to diversify your news sources to get anything resembling an accurate picture . 
  you ca n't rely only on a one source , expecting that they will always spoon-feed you high quality , unbiased and truthful news - doing that is the best recipe to achieving the exact opposite outcome . 
   considering public broadcaster is funded from the taxes , i ca n't find it acceptable that it 's somehow government propaganda mouthpiece . 
  somehow ? 
  that 's the * sole * purpose they were created for in the first place . 
  and well , neighter do i really , that 's why i 've been a supporter of privatization of government-owned media for a long time . 
   i assume wiadomosci is the most watched news program in poland . 
  actually , the private tv stations have their own news programs , and the two major ones have a similar amount of audience to wiadomo\u015bci - namely wydarzenia on polsat , and fakty on tvn . 
  each one of them , just like tvp 's wiadomo\u015bci , is biased in its own specific way . 
  those biases are plainly known to anyone in poland , and if you want to get a bigger picture , it 's good to compare how each of the major stations reports on any given news piece . 
   we had a government change and i have n't noticed any differences in reporting . 
  and when we have a government change , you can notice the differences in reporting in government-owned media not so long afterwards , the exact period depending on how long it would take for the ruling party at the time to replace the board members . 
  the government-owned media in poland have worked that way since i can remember , and i 'm completely unsurprised that this tradition was retained with the most recent government change . 
   considering what government propaganda mouthpiece is tvp 's wiadomosci you could say that sentence in any year since wiadomo\u015bci started to be broadcasted , and it would remain exactly as true . 
  government-owned media in poland always presented worldview of their owner , the government - just like privately-owned media in poland present worldview of their private owners . 
  the tusk vote was about internal polish politics , not about issues that are equally as important for all v4 countries . 
  yeah , being 3 times poorer per capita is so awesome , truly having a cake and eating it too . 
  edit as a response to your edit :  shall we remain your own minister antoni macierewicz that this year your country has bought over $ 3.1 billion dollars in weapons from the united states ? 
  you refused the european offer from airbus . 
  i do not recall the provision in the eu treaties that from now on we are obliged to buy all our military equipment exclusively from the french companies , while buying stuff from our primary nato allies , usa , becomes strictly forbidden . 
  why would it be ? 
  until today it somehow never struck me that radio stations quoting what newspapers wrote is supposed to be something abnormal . 
  well , correct me if i wrong , but i do n't really see anything weird about the fact that the polish radio , in its foreign language news service , is reporting on what one of the dailies in poland wrote earlier about some issue . 
  this particular sentence consists exclusively of quoting verbatim what gpc wrote . 
  the part you have quoted in your post comes from that daily though . 
  gazeta polska codziennie is a privately-owned newspaper , not `` poland 's public broadcaster '' . 
  yes . 
  the electorate of korwin 's parties always consists primarily of young people . 
   and even if you could argue that a heavily totalitarian state with good living conditions i think you intended to write `` with ** bad ** living conditions '' there . 
  we also got fucked over pretty hard by nazi germany 's buddies until 1941 , soviet union . 
  users of highways , supporters of anti-smoking campaigns and volkswagen owners . 
  indeed , economically pis is n't right-wing in the slightest , but they have also a quite conservative view on social matters , as well as attempt to have a rather nationalist approach to issues like foreign policy or politics of memory . 
  while kukiz '15 - a big tent of various `` anti-establishment '' mostly right wing groups including direct democracy supporters , conservative liberals or nationalists - as well as korwin - right-libertarians with a monarchist wing , are both fundamentally distant from pis , they are also the only political groups that would actually consider a coallition with pis , if such a need arised . 
  the missing sentence continues like this : `` interestingly enough , the highest level of the opposition to poland 's membership in the eu was observed by the pollsters among the youngest respondents ( 18 - 24 years old ) . 
  according to cbos , youths declared their opposition to eu membership ** twice as often ** as respondents from any other age group . 
  however , even among them large majority supports eu membership , with 73 % declaring support . '', 
   first one clearly shows more people voting for pis with age but pis is not the only party that people with right-wing , conservative or nationalist views could consider supporting . 
  the first article clearly shows that the * top 3 * parties young people vote for are pis , kukiz '15 and korwin , all of which are right-wing to far right , and combined they have 64 % of support , which would be more than enough for a constitutional majority in a parliament had only young people voted . 
  no other group , not even 60 years and older , comes even close to having such a large proportion of voters supporting right wing parties . 
   the second one is behind a paywall so i ca n't see it . 
  the second article claims that `` according to the polls , the most euroenthusiasts are among the 35 - 44 years old age group . 
  [ ... ] however , the highest level of the opposition to poland 's membership in the eu was observed by the pollsters among the youngest respondents ( 18 - 24 years old ) . 
  according to cbos , youths declared their opposition to eu membership ** twice as often ** as respondents from any other age group . '', 
  [ political views . 
  wherever they made that research , it certainly was n't in poland , because in here young people are significantly more conservative or even nationalist , as well as less pro-eu than the 30-something - 40-something year old generation . 
  i think so . 
  i * do * find many indo-iranian languages also strangely similar to polish - when you transcribe them to latin alphabet , they really * do * seem somewhat closer than , let 's say , celtic ones or perhaps even germanic - the satem/centum divide seems to play a role in that . 
  that 's not to the extent baltic languages feel though - a number of situations such as `` i recognize this sentence structure !, 
  so that 's how this root evolved in baltic languages !, 
  '' , `` interesting how this clearly recognizable root came to mean something slightly different in baltic languages , than it did in slavic ones ! '', 
  i get with latvian and lithuanian is really incomparable to anything elese . 
  baltic and slavic languages being respectively the closest branches to each other compared to their relation to other branches of indo-european languages is a well-researched , proven fact . 
  that 's the balto-slavic languages for you . 
  zima = winter zimowy = winterish zimny = cold ( adjective ) zimno = cold ( adverb ) zimno = cold ( noun ), 
  i 'd say it 's the other way around , and it 's the winter which is `` coldy '' . 
  damn it , for a change there is an index where the * lower * your country is , the better , and * of course * we end up in top10 there . 
  because they are nice portraits . 
  yeah , that 's a nice roundabout . 
  well , the other countries in europe have a long enough history that they could actually come up with some other official holidays . 
   i 'm not talking about vilnius region , i 'm talking about whole of lithuania , you tried to do a coup that would enforce us to join poland . 
  and it failed , as it turned out that lithuania decided that they do n't want to rebuild the commonwealth after all , but rather have their own ethnic state for ethnic lithuanians . 
  well , it was quite a bummer for poland , sure , but in such situation it was only natural that poland decided go for plan b and claim the part of the former grand duchy where ethnic lithuanians * did n't * live in huge numbers , but ethnic poles happened to inhabit it in abundance . 
   we already had control of vilnius since our proclamation of independence ( february 16 ) from vilnius itself , that was within kingdom/republic of lithuania . 
  no , you had * claimed * the city/region since then . 
  the actual * control * over it was exercised by the german ober-ost command . 
  and it happened to be the german ober-ost command who local citizens of wilno took control of the city from on the new year 's day 1919 , and they happened to take control of the city under the flag of the newly restored republic of poland , as they felt as much a part of the polish nation , as people from pozna\u0144 , or krak\u00f3w did . 
   local autonomy , not creating ruthenian republic as buffer state . 
  remember we are talking about the situation post-riga treaty here . 
  in such case , a ruthenian republic , encompassing polesie , volhynia , parts of nowogr\u00f3dek voivodship and perhaps an exclave near stryj and stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w , would have very grotesque borders , and be in a very poor state economically , comparable to modern day moldova - as i do n't see those areas as either valuable nor desirable for poland to have back then , it obviously could be tried , but considering the aforementioned situation , such state would be very prone to the soviet takeover attempts . 
  an entirely different thing is if there was no riga peace treaty , and polish-ukrainian forces pushed further into soviets instead , that 's how a viable belarusian and ukrainian states could be actually created back then . 
   vilnius was not part of kingdom of poland , neither was eastern lithuania , yet you annexed it . 
  upper hungary was not a part of the kingdom of bohemia , no such state of `` slovakia '' existed before either , yet czechoslovakia still annexed it .
