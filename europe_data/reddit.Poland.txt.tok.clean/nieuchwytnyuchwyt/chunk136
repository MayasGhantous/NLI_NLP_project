  drawing borders basing on local population rather than historical claims was a pretty common occurrence in post ww1 europe . 
   facts and statistics can interpreted , given different agenda , yours that poles were morally good , but never bad . 
  i criticize polish actions in the interwar period quite often , especially the polish-soviet peace treaty of 1921 , which betrayed belarusian and ukrainian allies of poland , and resulted in a half-assed shape of poland that went against both nationalist idea of dmowski , and federalist idea of pi\u0142sudski . 
  subsequently , the policy of the polish state towards the minorities resulting from it also left much to be desired . 
  i 'm quite ambiguous about the zaolzie conflict with czechoslovakia - on one hand , they were total dicks agressively moving the border well into the ethnic polish territory in 1919 , on the other hand moving the border back to where it was in 1919 * just a few days after the munich conference * was a big mistake . 
  the conflict over wilno perhaps was n't handled in the nicest way it could be , but compared to those dark cards of the interwar polish history , from a moral standpoint it certainly is n't something we should be ashamed about either . 
   what makes you think that lithuanians will prioritize poland over lithuania 's independence ? 
  what makes you think that poles would priotize lithuanian nationalist-imperialist ambitions , over the right of self determination of local polish majority population ? 
   that 's what your own imagination is thinking . 
  i wish that was only my imagination but , alas , that 's what official line of republic of lithuania appears to be , and what lithuanians repeat * ad infinitum * on the internet . 
   was not a gift , we already had control of the city before you occupied it , you forgetting \u017deligowski revolt ? 
  typical lithuanian argument , conveniently ignoring that poland already had a control of the city * before * \u017beligowski 's revolt pretty much since we regained independence in winter of 1918/1919 ( with interlude of bolshevik control between january and april 1919 ) , till the soviet takeover in june 1920 . 
   poles revolting against poles , does n't sound right , does it ? 
  more like poles revolting against an unwanted foreign government , which took control of their home city 2 months earlier after a shady deal with soviets who took it from the polish government in the first place . 
   says pole , who tries to justify ukrainian , belarusian land grab . 
  i actually do n't really care that much about almost uninhabited swamps of polesie , or mostly ukrainian volhynia , as there were virtually worthless once it was apparent that mi\u0119dzymorze / federation wo n't come to fruition ( though it was only apparent after the disastrous riga peace treaty where our belarusian and ukrainian allies were betrayed , in my opinion we should have actually pushed further to help them create their own states , as pi\u0142sudski originally envisioned but alas dmowski 's nationalists were against it ad screwed it up ) . 
  the only moral ambivalence i feel about it is that it * did * save people living there from soviet totalitarianism - though in such case , the polish government definitely should have given a great deal of local autonomy to polesie , volhynia and stanis\u0142aw\u00f3 voivodships - another great mistake interwar poland did . 
  anyhow , the only thing i justify are polish control of the polish-majority area in the northeast of the country , and the polish control of the historically polish ( a part of kingdom of poland since 1340 ) , ethnically mixed in proportions ranging from 40-60 to 50-50 in the southeast of the country . 
   yeah right , definitely not fuelled and blinded by ultra nationalistic tendencies . 
  til that hard facts and statistics are `` ultranationalistic tendencies '' . 
   did you make up this `` meme '' ? 
  because we do n't say such things . 
  poland forever lost two out of four principal centers of polish culture during the ww2 , and the justification given in those two cases were the exact opposite of each other . 
  if the argumentation of poland 's opponents was internally consistent , we would at least retain one of them - that 's the point of this meme . 
   we were n't soviet co-belligerents what are you talking about ? 
  you were n't ? 
  you surely seemed like ones from the polish perspective , considering the provisions of soviet-lithuanian treaty of summer 1920 . 
  giving soviets military access when their offensive against poland continued ? 
  or most importantly , taking as a gift a portion of territory soviets * just * took from poland ? 
   do n't understand what is your obsession with lithuanians in trying to portray them evil it stems from the lithuanian obsession in trying to portray poles as evil , and the ridiculous mental gymnastics they use to justify their blatant landgrab of ethnic polish teritory wile\u0144szczyzna was in the first half of the 20th century . 
  very infuriating for someone having enough historical knowledge to see through their bullshit . 
  seeing how attempts to forcefully implement this philosophy in the real world resulted in unprecedented amounts of misery , suffering and despair , i 'm actually quite sure that it can not . 
   what have you achieved an [ annualized gdp growth rate since the communism ended ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/gdp_growth_per_capita_%28annualized%29.png ) comparable to china in the same period , and better than ireland , south korea or hong kong . 
  and it only shows how * much * of a disaster communism was , if even with all that unprecedented economic growth during the last 25 years , right now we are still at best halfway through to catching up . 
  for more detail , see the table at the end of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_growth_1980%e2%80%932010#references ) article . 
  it `` went wrong '' , because it 's a shit and disgusting ideology . 
   its lithuanian land and city . 
  it was never yours to begin with . 
  [ i like how the main two arguments criticizing the eastern borders of interwar poland are internally contradictory . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pigpzpq.png )  poland circa 1920 just acted like a kindergarten bully poland circa 1920 was [ fighting for its survival against soviet russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 \\ ) ) , so it should n't come as a surprise that later that year it did n't have a soft spot for soviet russia 's co-belligerents such as the republic of lithuania , who provided military access and logistic help to soviet troops during their invasion of poland , for which they were gifted the ethnically polish wilno area soviets took from the republic of poland one month earlier . 
  polish census 2002 , polish census 2011 . 
  [ link to the latter ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/5670/22/1/1/struktura_narodowo-etniczna.pdf ) p. 104 and further the absolute numbers are a bit smaller than i remembered , but the proportion - that most orthodox polish citizens also declare polish ethnicity , remains . 
  what ? 
  in modern poland there are around 500 thousand orthodox polish citizens , out of which over 300 thousand are orthodox poles , 150 thousand are ukrainians and 50 thousand belarusians, 
   poles either in 1910 , however for 1900 there are no poles according to the data . 
  did n't hungarian censuses classify all slavs in that area as `` slovaks '' ? 
   next up , orawa or \u00c1rva was never a part of poland , the loan lasted for over * 350 years * . 
  at some point poland certainly realized that hungary is never going to pay the loan back . 
   either way , they were n't lithuanians , but poles , not matter what they considered themselves . 
  wilno confirmed to be majority polish in the interwar period by a radical lithuanian nationalist , i 'm screencaping this for further discussions . 
   next thing we 'll be hearing is that vilnius was majority polish ? 
  lol ... wilno * was * majority polish according to 1916 german census , so unless you are suggesting that germans were in on the great polish conspiracy , better get used to hearing about it . 
  it was n't a part of lithuania during the interwar period , and rightfuly so . 
  we took wilno from the german ober-ost command in january 1919 , then bolsheviks took it later the same month , then poland retook it from bolsheviks in april 1919 , then bolsheviks retook it from poland in june 1920 , then bolsheviks gave it to lithuania to secure their friendly neutrality in polish-bolshevik war , and then polish troops retook ithis polish-majority city for the * third * time in two years , this time for a little longer . 
  so yeah , you could say we `` stole '' it in october 1920 but at least also acknowledge that lithuania stole it from us three months earlier . 
  before the ww1 many of them really were neighter slovaks nor poles , and only after the polish-czechoslovak border was set , their national identity truly crystalized to whichever country they ended up in . 
  spisz and orawa , which is the area in question , was a part of poland between 1412 , and 1769 , so it 's not that unreasonable that 20-30 % of slavic highlanders living there might have identified more with poles than slovaks in * 1900 * . 
  \\  me \\  ultranationalist lol . 
  i 'm just pointing out the blatant lies spouted by lithuanian ultranationalists whenever i see them . 
  and tarnopol voivodship had 49 % poles ( compared to 46 % ukrainians ) , wilno voivodship had 60 % poles ( compared to 22 % belarusians and 5 % lithuanians ) , while nowogr\u00f3dek voivodship had 54 % poles ( compared to 38 % belarusians ) - yet all three voivodships were also annexed by ussr . 
   those areas were inhabited by almost exclusively belarusians and ukrainians yeah , those areas were inhabited by them `` almost exclusively '' to such extent , that poles had a * plurality * on them , and numbering over 5 million people and 38 % of its total population , were the single largest ethnic group there . 
  [ and that was n't only because they were spread out over the entire territory , they actually formed local majorities in significant partbof territory annexed by ussr , most notably almost the entire northeast including wilno and grodno areas .

  well , they * do * seem pretty happy about the land they got at least . 
   whereas nazis were out to wipe out people for arbitrary reasons . 
  as opposed to soviets , who for a change were out to wipe out people for arbitrary reasons . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_genocide_in_the_soviet_union, 
   when you 're dealing with an objective evil like the nazis . 
  or an objective evil like the soviets , who set out to exterminate people based on their flawed theories like communism . 
   but i think he looks much more impressive with such hair . 
  [ in fact , he * did * have such hair once ] ( https://s27.postimg.org/brlqkf4j7/z12767827_q_donald-_tusk-.jpg ) . 
   but it was n't created for that purpose what a cheap talk . 
  the * main * purpose behind eec ( which did n't become the eu until 1992 ) was economic cooperation and development as well as customs union and free trade , not to `` stop wars '' either . 
  though the latter was certainly used as a talking point to help sell the former . 
   since there has n't been any major war between eu countries since it was formed , it has done a pretty good job indeed , nato , eec , european space agency , european broadcasting union , the champions league and the microwave oven have all done a pretty good job since there were no wars in central europe since they were created !, 
  though we should n't forget about probably even more important factor , which is the existence of nuclear weapons , and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction resulting from that fact . 
  nato was n't ? 
  if anything , the danger of soviet agression during the cold war , and the nato cooperation that enused from it , did much more for the `` lack of war '' between european countries , than economic organizations such as efta , eec ( and its successor eu ) or perhaps ecsc did . 
  oh dear , here we have a prime example of `` correlation implying causation '' fallacy . 
  let 's have some similar , and equally as true sentences : * number of wars in central europe before nato : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since nato : none . 
  or perhaps * number of wars in central europe before uefa : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since uefa : none . 
  or maybe * number of wars in central europe before techno : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since techno : none . 
  out of [ 16 voivodships of interwar poland , poles were n't a majority or plularity only in three ( volhynia , stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w and polesie ) ] ( http://polska1918-89.pl/photos/demografia-w-ii-rp,2149.jpg ) , and even there they made up about 20 % of population , which is an order of magnitude higher than the lithuanian proportion of population on the territory of interwar poland claimed by republic of lithuania . 
  also , even that borders were considered too extensive by polish * nationalists * . 
  during the peace talks with soviets in 1921 in riga , the soviet delegation actually offered poland a border about a 100 kilometers further east , but ( much to the dismay of pi\u0142sudski ) * nationalists * in polish delegation declined , argumenting that there are too much ukrainians/belarusians , and not enough poles there . 
  polish nationalists in the interwar period ( dmowski 's party ) were supporters of polish borders encompassing territory strictly with polish majority or plurality , it were federalists ( pi\u0142sudski 's party ) who wanted to rebuild poland in a way resembling the commonwealth , at least in pre-1772 borders , and as a ( con ) federation of various nations inhabiting that territory , that would be a strong counterweight to both russia and germany . 
  in the end , neighter conception was fully realized , the end result was something in between - an outcome about which both dmowski , and pi\u0142sudski were n't happy in the slightest . 
   i consider myself lithuanian nationalist , but in no way i would ever want those lands back , those lands have nothing left of lithuanian in them any more and would be more of a problem than extension to our nation state . 
  the same was the case for wilno area in the interwar period , yet radical lithuanian nationalists back then did n't seem to care about that in the slightest . 
  well , we would still end up almost 1/4 bigger than we are right now if at the same time we also got back all the land soviets took from us in 1939/1944 . 
   doesnt make sense to post photos of johannesburg or san paulo here . 
  of course it does n't , as neither south africa , nor brazil have any territory in europe . 
  france on the other hand , as it was already established in this thread , has integral parts of its territory * outside * of europe - be it south america , africa or perhaps even oceania . 
  in fact , we even happen to post under a photo of one of those * non-european * parts of its territory . 
   they have absolutely full voting power , they control all votes , while the president ( who can veto such things ) is also pis ... there is no actual democracy here anymore . 
  i do n't really follow you here . 
  is `` actual democracy '' somehow supposed to be about the ruling party not having enough votes to pass new bills , and president ( mandatory from a different party than the government ) having to veto everything ?
