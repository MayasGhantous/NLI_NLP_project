  town hall estimates are unreliable , considering that the same party that organised this rally happens to control the town hall , and they have a long history of inflating numbers by a completely absurd factor in similar situations . 
  source : the previous time po was in power . 
  * what * recent `` media restrictions '' ? 
  that 's like saying paris is a part of france , france is n't a part of paris . 
  i do n't see what your point is , is n't french guyana supposed to be exactly as much france as paris , corsica , or auvergne ? 
  by that logic , we could be posting pictures of paris to / r/southamerica well enough , because it 's a city in france , and france is also a country in south america after all . 
   please keep going if you want , it does n't change the fact the mayotte is part of the eu , please keep going if you want , it does n't change the fact this is / r/europe , not / r/eu . 
   you really believe that ? 
  not really , but i * hope * that might happen . 
  though it probably wo n't , especially if the attitude from a considerable part of political spectrum will amount to `` hurr durr dictatorship '' , which seems quite likely . 
   regarding the constitutional mess i * know * how the mediocrity of 1997 constitution came to be - it was designed to favor specific , long obsolete circumstances of mid 90s politics . 
  does n't mean i have to accept that we are condemned to it forever - if i was old enough back then , i would definitely vote against it in the referendum where it barely passed , and for many years i 've been welcoming every glimpse of hope that it might finally be replaced by a new document that would be more consistent , or at least seriously reformed . 
  and this is one of those occasions - while going further towards chancellor system would be a good choice in my opinion , even a reasonably good presidential or semi-presidential system would be miles ahead of the system we have right now . 
  of course , i have no doubts that pis is quite likely to screw it up , to some degree , but even if their project will somehow manage to be worse than the 1997 constitution , different projects from other sides of the political spectrum will also appear , bringing closer the much desired outcome of constitutional overhaul in one way or another . 
  well , i think it 's pretty clear that the current model , arising solely from the fact that sld wanted to make their parliamentary rule more powerful than wa\u0142\u0119sa 's presidency , but when the project of constitution was almost finished , kwa\u015bniewski won the presidential election in 1995 , while aws overtook sld in parliamentary polls not so long afterwards , so the presidential powers were hastily increased , but within the earlier framework of parliamentary domination , has clearly run its course by now . 
  a major overhaul is certainly needed , and system proposed by pis would have to be * really * bad to manage to be worse than the total mess from 1997 constitution . 
  what i am happy about is that the serious debate about constitutional reform will finally start now . 
  i 'll wait with my assesments until i see the proposed changes though . 
  good news , considering that a constitutional reform is long overdue in poland , and the referendum is pretty much the only way to do it because you 'll never get 2/3 of parliament to agree even on most basic of issues . 
  i wonder what exactly the changes proposed in this one will amount to though . 
  i 'm afraid this title belongs to self-hating poles actually , anything that even remotely presents poland in a positive way triggers them immensely . 
  by not living in united states . 
  well , that would surely be an improvement , considering the circumstances in which the 1997 constition was written . 
  pis highlighting all the flaws and taking advantage of all the loopholes of 1997 constitution in the current term makes it more likely that such discussion will actually happen sometime in the future , and a better document will replace it sooner rather than later . 
  no , the way to fix it would be to implement a brand new constitution which would avoid the countless flaws and loopholes the 1997 constitution has . 
   it was so liberal and progressive then there would have been a functioning military to protect it . 
  quite the contrary , they just had this whole `` why spend our taxes on military ? '', 
  and `` if we wo n't be a threat to our neighbors , our neighbors wo n't threaten us '' mindset a few centuries too early . 
  \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a higher local purchasing power than warsaw ? 
  would have never thought so . 
  it obviously was n't , but you asked about `` the last decade of two '' . 
  quite nice . 
   can you name one person who died in poland because of the policial views idk in last decade or two or maybe more ? 
  actually , back in 2010 some nutjob attacked a pis office in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , killing one pis member and injuring another one . 
   if one country was facing a process he should not be allowed to vote in the process of anther country . 
  i do n't see such a provision in the eu treaties . 
  simultaneous ? 
  i do n't think you can make a one * combined * vote against both poland and hungary , as situation in those countries obviously is n't exactly the same . 
  on the other hand , i do n't see how holding two separate votes , even on the same day , could prevent the other country from voting - one of the votings * has * to be proceeded first , even if only by a few minutes , and thus the other country would continue to have every right to vote against it . 
  the truth is , with the current political configuration in eu i do n't see a scenario in which the procedure from article 7 could possibly be implemented succesfuly . 
   why would you leave a union that allows your people to easily move to many other , bigger , richer and more advanced economies exactly in what way is that a * positive * for poland - the * country * ? 
  are you saying that doubling the rate of losing citizens for other countries should be among poland 's goals ? 
  eu sanctions need to be passed unanimously , so good luck with that while it 's certain that poland wo n't support sanctions against hungary , and hungary wo n't support sanctions against poland - and i 'm quite sure those wo n't be the * only * countries to do so . 
  well , it 's surely interesting to see you being not so keen on upholding the rule of law anymore when it does n't suit you . 
  `` public '' as in `` state-owned '' . 
  you won this time , but next time watch out . 
  dunno , being a sad , ignored and irrelevant member of a big community does n't sound that much better than being a single sad alone country . 
  well , makes me glad we cancelled that helicopter deal with france after all . 
   and i do n't care what happens in south korea but you surely care about greece , so i 'll be surprised if you wo n't advocate for imminent action against them , considering how * serious * infringement of press freedom must be out there - after all , they are `` quite below '' poland you are so concerned about ( speaking clearly , as much behind poland as poland is behind uk , france or usa ) . 
   the young are very liberal in poland what ? 
  are you talking about the same country i live in ? 
  because here 's the breakdown of the recent election results among the 18-25 age group : * 25 % pis - current ruling party , national-conservative ( 37 % in general population ) * 20 % kukiz '15 - right-wing populist ( 9 % in general population ) * 17 % korwin - right-libertarian ( 4.7 % in general population , barely missed the 5 % electoral threshold ) * 15 % po - centre-right , former ruling party , epp ( 24 % in general population ) * 8 % . n - centrist , liberal ( 8 % in general population ) * 5 % razem - far-left ( 3.5 % in general population ) * 4 % zl - remnants of the commie party & left-liberals ( 7.5 % in general population , did not get in due to threshold for coallitions being 8 % ) * 4 % psl - agarian party ( 5 % in general population )  warsaw is center-left . 
  actually , in the last election , warsaw was pretty much split between pis and po , with po having only less than one percent votes more than pis , and pis actually won in many districts .

   rsf press freedom index the one where poland was only a little bit below usa , uk or france , on par with italy , and above greece , south korea or japan ? 
  i still wonder what exactly is the methodology of the group publishing this ranking , considering that during the last few years the only major event that would be even remotely related to `` press freedom infringement '' in poland happened back in 2014 , when police raided the headquaters of the wprost weekly , after they published recordings of private conversations of ministers from donald tusk 's government . 
  and interestingly enough , it did n't seem to affect our place in the `` press freedom raking '' one bit ( i think we actually even went * up * the following year ) . 
  meanwhile , nothing of the sort happened during the last two years , there were no new laws regulating the press either , yet we somehow managed to drop below france and uk . 
  you mean the high unemployment north - low unemployment south divide ? 
  because that 's the only one i can somewhat see on this map , and even that is a huge stretch . 
  [ it can be seen even more clearly on the county level . 
   west / east devide in poland ( ? ), 
  [ is there really ? 
  ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/h/146/art413586.png ), 
  that was indeed the case in * early * 1800s , but by late 1800s , nordics already were on par with most of central europe . 
  and by 1930s , norway was already the wealthiest country in europe per capita , with sweden not being far behind .

  a communist party endorsing a candidate would certainly encourage me to think about voting for whoever they * did n't * endorse . 
  similarly in poland , both the czech republic and the historical kingdom of bohemia are simply called `` czechy '' in polish language . 
  well , him being a member of the polish minority party kinda makes his national allegiance self explanatory , do n't you think ? 
  i doubt that both his maternal and paternal ancestors loaned huge sums of money towards prussia taking over pozna\u0144 from poland either , while analogous situation was the case for copernicus . 
   or would you say an inhabitant of poznan who was born in 1871 and died in 1916 was german ? 
  i mean , he was born in germany , studied , worked , lived most of his live and died there . 
  it 's hard to think of an example of someone from 19th century having an analogous lifestyle to the one copernicus had in the 15th one but if he , let 's say , worked in the german administration , or perhaps was a military leader who commanded the german troops against polish uprising , then yes , i would probably call him a german . 
  a big number of poles got germanized during the partitions . 
  germans are constantly trying to claim one of the most widely known kingdom of poland 's historical citizens to themselves , obviously we need to counter those attempts . 
  was n't a part of `` germany '' either . 
  father 's side of the family was living in krak\u00f3w for at least two generations prior to copernicus being born , and if you want to go so far behind , we can go a few more years as well , considering that both lower and upper silesia belonged to poland prior to the czech takeover in 1327-1348 . 
  that indeed was the case for a lot of poles living in the german partition . 
  how did you think millions of modern germans ended with polish sounding surnames ? 
   any source showing both his parents were poles from krakow ? 
  but it was * you * who was claiming that * both * his parents did not come from poland in the first place . 
  burden of proof lies on the one who claims something . 
  kopernik 's father , and his family was from krak\u00f3w : miko\u0142aj kopernik ( ok . 1420 -- 1483 ) -- ojciec , by\u0142 kupcem krakowskim ; synem jana kopernika -- zamo\u017cnego hurtownika krakowskiego [ 5 ] . 
  pi\u0142sudski felt polish and lithuanian in a way some people feel british and also welsh . 
   she was not allowed to go to university in poland . 
  it 's your ancestors ' fault , guys , not ours . 
  in * russian-occupied poland * . 
  as well as being born in poland , living most of your life in poland , and dying in poland . 
   his parents do not come from poland til the capital of poland at the time , krak\u00f3w , was not in poland . 
   directly inside the historical sections . 
  the historical sections of warsaw in the area where the skyscrapers are located right now were already razed to the ground by germans back in 1944 . 
   in-fact has there ever been a country that turned into a dictatorship after ` going left ' , as in a country that was n't a dictatorship/monarchy beforehand that did ? 
  czechoslovakia after the soviet takeover in 1946-48 . 
  that 's still makes the potential pool of supercentenarians over twice as big . 
  there are 4.5 billion of them . 
  or they can use their power as an eu member , to propose the deal that will be to their liking . 
  i 'm sure they 'll have support of many other eu members , such as poland if they do so . 
  we do n't even have the letter '' \u00e1 '' in our alphabet . 
  apparently ireland , which happens to be the eu member as of now , does * not * wish to impose a hard border on this particular foreign nation .
