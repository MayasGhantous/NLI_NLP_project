  hardly an achievement . 
  only the ww2 itself was worse than that . 
   \u017de\u010dpospolita that word looks even more awesome than rzeczpospolita . 
  reality has a well known anti-russian bias . 
  yeah , i still remember when polish wikipedia was the 4th largest in the world for several years . 
  we did one sentence long bot-created articles before it was cool ( i.e. 
  dutch and swedish ) . 
  by now we have probably dropped to 6th or 7th though . 
  of course they were n't . 
  it was an intended hyperbole on my part though i thought it seemed more obvious when i wrote it . 
  i 'm just tired of that `` every cia action = something bad '' bullshit . 
   poland and the whole nation of poland to this day is glad for that cia interference . 
  if that 's how all cia actions were , the cia is literally the organization that has done most good in the history of mankind . 
  ( though really , giving cia all credit for overthrowing the communist regime in poland is seriously overestimating their capabilities ), 
  that 's a quite recent development and would only apply to the last two-three centuries , and even then we had our moments ( like the [ 1920 war against soviet russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) ) . 
  historically poland and russia were usually quite equal in power , and i 'd say in the 16th and 17th century poland was even a bit stronger than russia . 
  unlike ukrainian and russian names , polish names are not written in cirilic but in latin alphabet . 
  and yes , we let lithuanians write their names in lithuanian or germans in german . 
  we do n't use letters like `` v '' or `` x '' in polish language , but if you have one in your name or surname - no problem . 
   it 's not a pandora box , it 's the reality that many poles fail to address what , that we have gotten eastern germany after wwii as a war compensation ? 
  i thought it was pretty much the consensus among polish population . 
   that in warshaw only 46 % of people were polish that 's \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , large textile industry center which grew in size about 1000 times in the 19th century . 
  warsaw is about 100km to the northeast . 
  and numbers check out , rest of them were mostly jews probably . 
   claim was a polish majority ( or at least largest percentage ) , this data shows pretty low numbers ( around 3 % ) are you talking about gda\u0144sk / danzig ? 
  it was ethnicaly german since the 1308 teutonic massacre of the native polish/pomeranian population and i 've never seen anyone claiming otherwise . 
  and still , the german-speaking citizens of danzig were one of the most loyal citizens of poland until the partitions . 
   polish people envy how belarussian people live kek, 
   perception would change if polish minority leaders would n't be so pro-russian . 
  they are pro-russian because in early 1990s , when there still was ussr , [ russians have supported autonomy for poles in lithuania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_national-territorial_region ) . 
  yay we western nao . 
   how did a small , newly independent country with few natural resources manage to leave the rest of the eastern block in the dust and reach a comparable level with western europe in such a short timespan ? 
  very easily . 
  in 1991 slovenia was already the richest of the `` commie block '' countries . 
  actually i think their lead was even bigger back then than today . 
   reddit is the last place i expected to see this bullshit . 
  well , i 'm glad you realize that politically reddit is an utter circlejerk in the same way w **** . pl is , just here it is skewed to the left . 
  unlike you though i 'm here not to see my opinions validated , but for fresh , high quality content . 
  it 's alright , now when i look at it , i think i have slightly misunderstood the tone of your question . 
  i keep on forgetting that not everyone is a history buff and while not knowing anything at all about the commonwealth is like not knowing anything at all about the united provinces or habsburg monarchy , it 's nothing unusual . 
  small . 
  infrastructure , army and police , maybe dotations for health care and education . 
  a benevolent , competent monarch without absolutist aspirations would be ideal , though unfortunately completely utopic and unrealistic so i 'd settle for some kind of swiss-like direct democracy . 
  habeas corpus , religious freedom and tolerance , most democratic regime in europe ... and all that before the end of 16th century . 
  being one of the major european great powers for a few centuries . 
  first constitution in europe . 
  [ creating heliocentric model of the universe . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolaus_copernicus ) [ 17th century multi-stage rockets . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micha%c5%82_s%c4%99dziw%c3%b3j ) at first i wanted to ask you whether there were any belgian landmark historic achievements other than congo genocide , but then i probably would seem as ignorant as you . 
   parts of poland are serbian oh , so we are not allies anymore ? 
  though that alliance of the two biggest superpowers + hungary was too op anyway . 
  effects of transformation in these cities were n't as succesful as in other large polish cities . 
  especially \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was hit really hard by the decline of the textile industry . 
  it 's the poorest of the big polish cities , and its population have dropped last 20 years by over 100,000 and from the rank 2nd to 3rd in poland . 
  sometimes it 's even called ` polish detroit ' . 
  there was also a ` skin hunters ' gang of doctors killing patients in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in early 2000s which surely contributed to the city 's image . 
  the other two cities are smaller ( both have about 250k inhabitants ) , but have disproportionally large frequency of bizarre crimes or other weird events happening there so when something like that happens the usual comments are `` oh , of course , it 's radom/sosnowiec '' . 
  few years ago it was bia\u0142ystok city in eastern poland which was described that way , there was even a ` bia\u0142ystok is an internet hoax ' fad , but lately it seems that radom and sosnowiec took over this role . 
  not yet , but elections are next year . 
  knowing the likely outcome , poland entering eurozone this decade is about as probable as sweden or uk doing so . 
  government 's position must be really weak then , as it seems that 's enough for opposition to lead the polls by huge marign . 
  quite depressing vision of future , if you asked me . 
  the other russian bases in the baltic are not ice-free though . 
  that 's precisely the reason stalin wanted koenigsberg so much . 
  when you grow up with it , you do n't find it weird at all . 
  quite the contrary , seeing foreign soap operas without a monotonous voiceover feels weird . 
  well , at least until you do n't think about it too much . 
  napoleon is presented as a hero who have won wars with evil prussia and austria who have [ conquered poland 10 years earlier ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) , and attacked , but unfortunately lost , with [ even more evil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_praga ) russia holding the remaining part of poland captive . 
  he is considered [ a liberator of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_warsaw ) , and it is mentioned proudly that we were the only [ sincere ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_first_coalition ) and [ faithful ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haitian_revolution ) allies [ of france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_somosierra ) during [ the whole period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leipzig ) . 
  even in our national anthem there are verses da\u0142 nam przyk\u0142ad bonaparte jak zwyci\u0119\u017ca\u0107 mamy . 
  ( bonaparte has given us the example of how we should prevail . ), 
  psl always fares poorly in polls though . 
  yet in elections they always manage to get that 7-8 % of vote no matter how low they were in polls . 
  probably other poles who care about foreign affairs too . 
  maybe it was stupid and pointless . 
  the point is , if us have changed its mind once , who can guarantee us they wo n't do it again . 
  they forever stopped to be seen as reliable and trustworthy partners by us . 
  czech republic , hungary and slovakia have the same standard of living as poland and they do not require visas . 
  same with baltic states which are no different from poland save for us visa policy either . 
  even citizens of chile can travel to us visa-free . 
  there is clearly a lot of bad will in this issue on usa side . 
  we * are * your friend . 
  just the little things like promising missile shield and permanent american bases in poland and then telling us you have changed your mind or the fact that afer 20 years we still need visas to visit our best ally makes us wonder if this alliance is worth anything more than our alliance with uk and france in 1939 . 
  shit like that really damages perception of usa here . 
  it was much better during commie times and in the 90 's when you were idealized as the best country in the world , the free world defender and enemy of communism . 
  stealing ? 
  that 's pretty bold word considering the city was n't even controlled by lithuania , but by poland for most of 1919 and 1920 , and the lithuanians made up about 2 % of city 's population when compared to 50 % poles and 40 % jews . 
  the only reason \u017beligowski 's action was needed was the fact that when soviet russia took the city over during the polish-bolshevik war they have given it to lithuania counting on worsening pl-lt relations by that move . 
  they succeeded . 
  claiming this city by lithuania as their capital in 1920 's was comparable to modern france claiming aachen to be their capital or modern greece claiming istanbul . 
  historically accurate but irrelevant by every other measure . 
  yeah , today it 's about $ 1438 , tomorrow it might be $ 1400 or $ 1500 . 
  you do n't really convert miles to the fractions of meters , and converting floating currencies this way is even more meaningless , as exchange rate changes every day . 
  and while average salary is n't * exactly * 6000pln either , it wo n't decrease or increase by say 50pln every time pln-eur exchange rate changes . 
   and i bet that 's before taxes as these things are always reported . 
  of course it 's before taxes . 
  seems it 's more like about 1500 $ then . 
  though it varies in time due to fluctuating pln-eur exchange rate . 
   in fact , i always wanted to point out that the only thing poland will get for sucking america 's dick is a fat dick in its mouth . 
  that 's still an improvement when compared to the situation from the cold war era .
