  prussia was a vassal of poland in xvi and xvii century . 
  not really a part of poland , but i would n't say poland had no real talk there . 
  well , what was the last time you heard about koenigsberg , sudeten or pomeranian germans , volhynian poles or native americans complaining ? 
  :p but seriously , i did n't intend to start a flame war or anything by that sentence , and i 'm sad my intentions were misunderstood . 
  i just wanted to highlight that because most lithuanians act like they were unaware of the fact that those poles who apparently are such a big problem for them did n't came to lithuania , but lithuania came to * them * . 
  if you want to look at this in this way ... yes , that might be the moral of this story . 
  though it 's rather doubtful morally moral . 
  it 's great they have it . 
  basques in spain have basque kindergartens , schools , universities , newspapers , etc. 
  too and some of them are still pretty pissed off . 
  there are more polish schools in lithuania than anywhere else except poland because in lithuania there are more poles than anywhere else except poland ( and maybe belarus ) . 
  what 's so unusual about that ? 
  also , they have to whine about * something * . 
  that 's the very point of any ethnic minority party after all . 
  and most importantly , why this signs thing is such a big deal for you lithuanians ? 
  [ why ca n't these areas have bilingual street signs , a standard practice existing everywhere else in civilised world ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ) that 's what we in poland can not understand . 
  hence you get this situation . 
  as for comparison with belarus , [ you might want to check out about this rethorical figure , which is great for highlighting such problems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperbole ) . 
  ^ ( also , no offence and do n't take this as an attack , but this is what you usualy get when you annex another country 's territory , and wo n't do much ethnic cleansing there . ), 
  ^ ( edit : spelling and some minor corrections ), 
  the problem is on the lithuanian side , really . 
  i ca n't help but agree with that action of polish mp 's ( though despise their party anyway ) . 
  at least once they have done something beneficial . 
  why areas where polish people in lithuania live ca n't have bilingual signs ? 
  [ we have them in poland , in german , kashubian , belarussian and even lithuanian ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/gminy_z_dodatkowymi_nazwami.png ) and no harm was done to our country because of that . 
  why after almost 25 years of independence lithuania was not able to provide legislation enabling something similar ? 
  especially while polish minority there is much bigger than any minority in poland which have this right . 
  yeah , a ruler of poland , sweden and russia . 
  imagine the possibilities . 
  \\  poland \\  proper governance though if we have done so good with the terrible governance we had , i wonder where we could be , had we really got `` proper governance '' in the last 20 years . 
  from * where * ? 
  you are not supposed to say that name in other places . 
  well , they probably just want it to stay that way . 
  [ similar video - german military parade in paris ( 1941 ) ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xgzgambojzu ), 
  neither is cyprus , slovenia , czech republic , hungary , poland or slovakia . 
  though it 's just `` eastern enlargement '' , not `` eastern european '' so , save for malta , it is correct . 
  good . 
   to have a single eu state hell no . 
   i find these ` movements ' by catalonia and scotland to be a nuisance and distraction to our end-goal here in europe . 
  oh , it 's an end-goal now ? 
  i must have missed the memo . 
   southern ireland annexed by the uk . 
  you forgot about anschluss of austria into germany . 
   basically , any microstates that are n't viable should be annexed by the larger state . 
  #  belgium #  microstate ( though the belgium one , if the citizens of belgium would agree with it , is the only one that actually makes sense . ), 
  answering your question : no , i do n't see catalonia and scotland as a threat to eu . 
  quite the contrary - the more regions in europe will get their chance for self-determination , the better for eu . 
   global markets yeah , the worldwide conspiracy to raise global temperature by 4c , i tell you man . 
  well , what 's your alternative ? 
  i 'm pretty sure if we all completely stopped using the oil today , it would go even worse for humanity . 
  i mean , who needs shit like transport , energy or plastics anyway ? 
  i think the very obscure concept of `` emigration '' might be alien to you . 
  if you have n't heard about it yet , you definitely should check it out . 
  oh , surely , i hold thatcher and austrian economists in general in high esteem . 
  but is that term easily recognizable ? 
  is it even possible to be a thatcherite in poland ? 
  i probably could also call myself a `` paleolibertarian '' , or something similar , but would n't that be getting too specific ? 
  for me , `` economic libertarian '' is enough . 
  of course they are , that 's why i would never vote for them in sejm elections . 
  but they are also ultimate eurosceptics which , for me , is good enough for european parliament . 
  we do n't have ukip here . 
  i 'm not confused , the flair space was limited so i had to oversimplify . 
  also it would get very tumblr-ry if i included even more detailed labels . 
  of course i am a conservative - socially . 
  i never tried to pretend otherwise . 
  there are many different branches of libertarianism - there are left-libertarians , there are right-libertarians , there are paleolibertarians , there are minarchists . 
  i hold a belief that the only duty of state should be public safety ( police ) and national defense ( military ) . 
  i 'd consider it pretty libertarian , but maybe you 'll help me overcome my confusion . 
  and i 'm not from krak\u00f3w . 
  not even close . 
  he is entitled to his own opinion . 
  and it 's not like i 'm advocating that the current economic system works perfectly ( i have rather opposite opinion ) , and it 's not that pope ever said that increased taxation , regulations and state interventionism are the way to go . 
  he did n't . 
  what he said is not socialism , and it 's not even nothing new . 
  the [ catholic social teachnig ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_social_teaching ) , which this is great example of , is known for over 100 years . 
  and , most importantly , pope is infallible only in faith matters , it 's not like every catholic have to always agree with him in 100 % . 
  as it usually is with pope francis , most ` controversial ' things he says are out of context . 
  full quote was `` marxist ideology is wrong . 
  but i have met many marxists in my life who are good people , so i do n't feel offended '' . 
  so he then says you would find many elements catholics could agree with even in marxist ideology . 
  that 's hardly controversial . 
  but i was replying to the someone claiming that there is something ` interesting ' in not being ` catholic ' and ` socialist ' at the same time ( well , for me * this * way of thinking is interesting , as from what i observed in my life i find correlation between being socialist and being catholic rather low ) , so i thought that pius ' quote was extremly relevant there . 
   eu  right-wing policies are we in the same eu ? 
  here in poland eu 's policies are considered incredibly left-wing . 
  by the most common : `` an economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy '' . 
  the one that calls for wealth redistribution and calls for the nationalisation of the means of production . 
  the one which stems from the marxist theory of historical materialism . 
  it 's nothing strange , as pope pius xi wrote , `` no one can be at the same time a good catholic and a true socialist '' . 
  not sure yet . 
  probably either for ruch narodowy ( i would never vote for them in domestic elections because of their economic views but that 's not the case in european elections ) , kongres nowej prawicy ( the always-1 % - party ) , or maybe gowin 's polska razem ( not that i trust them ) . 
  the one that will be most likely to pass 5 % threshold will have my vote . 
  both . 
  it 's true at least in my case . 
   egoistical who is n't ? 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma, 
  there is even a saying in polish `` za kr\u00f3la olbrachta wygin\u0119\u0142a szlachta '' - `` during the reign of the king albert the nobility died-off '' ( it sounds better in polish ) regarding this battle . 
  so had west african slave traders . 
  should west african countries apologise to themselves ? 
   if rich people are stuck on an eternal guilt trip , then many poor people who previously lived in slave like conditions are stuck on being victims , even now .
