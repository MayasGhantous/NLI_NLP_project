  how about we all stop this ridiculous taxation of the rich to fund social programmes for the poor who can survive quite well on their own and let them get back their integrity and drive . 
  as a libertarian , i do not see anything wrong with this statement . 
  social programmes are terribly inefficient way to deal with poverty . 
  and so is providing all that expensive help to the third world countries . 
  oh , i 'm pretty sure at this point i 've read about literally dozens of things , including banning leaded petrol , or the end of the crack epidemic , that contributed to lowering the crime rate in new york in the 90 's in a significant way . 
  correlation does not equal causation . 
  the ruling party is not really aiming to follow current western trends ( yeah , since everyone opposing the dear leader was purged out of party they were trying a bit lately , but unsuccesfully ) . 
  well , at least for me , that 's one of the sparse things in which our ruling party is not horribly wrong . 
  we should n't blindly follow the western europe in everything just `` because that 's how it 's done there and they are infallible '' . 
  surely , i 'm mainly thinking about economic matters here , but it makes sense about social ones too . 
  also , i 'm pretty certain the ruling party will lose incoming elections in 2015 . 
  and i 'm pretty sure the next parliament will be much more conservative than the current one , especially with palikot 's oddballs out of sejm , and elections won ( at least if the more sane part of our right wing wo n't get their shit together ) by social-conservative-but-economical-socialist nutjobs from pis . 
  well , i think the annexation of wilno , one of the four biggest centers of the polish culture , and the countryside around the city inhabited mainly by poles , all done by a general native to the area was a great example of the `` for ** our ** freedom '' part . 
  could n't agree more . 
  i intended to write something similar when i read the op , but you pretty much covered it all . 
  and then , there 's just `` portugal '' . 
   russia sees poland as one of the bigger threats to their national security seems that feeling is mutual . 
   i wish black people would die out `` that 's racist !, 
  guys you see this sick nazi fuck right there ? '', 
   i wish white people would die out `` who cares , we are all humans anyway . 
  also seeing predominantly white nations makes me physically sick . '', 
  really , when i read some of the comments in this thread i feel as if someone is taking an elaborate prank on me . 
  turns out it 's just a weird and full of contradictions mixture of self-hating , white guilt and misinformation . 
  i neither like nor dislike immgirants in general . 
  oh , of course i like the percieved safety of my 99.9 % white , culturally homogenous society though , so i 'd rather have native population of my country increased instead of importing uneducated , culturally alien people from whatever third world country . 
  sorry if that offends you . 
  ( and , after all , it 's not like they would really like to come to us anyway . 
  our social spending fortunately is quite low , and you 'll get better salaries in the western europe ) . 
  i do n't have bad experiences with immigrants . 
  i never had any problems with ukrainians or vietnamese in poland . 
  they are hard-working and generally non-violent people ( i suppose we percive them similar to how poles are percieved in the west ) . 
  i would have nothing against even more of them coming to my country , as long as we stay in demographical collapse , they really might become essential to our economy in the future . 
  oh , i 'm pretty sure i indeed am a catholic nut , at least for you . 
  though that 's not really an unique achievement , every one who is not a far-left nutjob could look like that on this subreddit by comparsion . 
  you might even call me a bigot , feel free to , i do n't really care . 
  this phrases became so devalued nowadays i wear them as a badge of honour . 
  ( edit )  you are racist yeah , whatever . 
  do you even have any arguments ? 
  but you are still trying to insult me . 
  that 's exactly why i rarely even bother to comment on reddit . 
  i do n't consider anything i wrote racist - and if i did , please point it out to me ( not that i really * care * about not being racist . 
  actually it 's pretty low on my priority list . 
  fortunately i do n't have to worry about it on daily basis , save for redditing ) . 
  i 'd treat a random white , black , yellow or green person the exact same way , just like i do n't really treat ugly and pretty , or tall and low people differently . 
  it 's not how you look like , but how you behave that matters to me . 
  is n't it all that anyone should do ? 
  maybe because decreasing population means complete economical collapse in the long run , especially with current retirement system . 
  less population also means that your country will become more and more insignificant in the future when compared to the now less relevent countries which are increasing their population . 
  look where europe was in the world stage 100 years ago , and where it is now . 
  and the trends are n't changing . 
  compile both , and that reasons alone are much more than enough for me to consider increasing population important . 
  not sure if sarcarm or serious . 
   do n't whitewash history to make the soviets seem worse . 
  there 's no need . 
  there 's no need indeed . 
  soviets already seem worse even without whitewashing history . 
   just an insult to actual communists and marxist leninists . 
  so , that 's great . 
  i 'd insult this kind of people without second thought .

  [ welcome to the club .

  i do n't give a shit what do you think , it was . 
  also fuck you . 
   i wish communism had been given more of a chance . 
  you are free to go to the north korea . 
  there you can see how any real communism will eventually end up . 
  i hope you 'll enjoy your stay . 
  [ 0:49 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x6pozid.png ) the small countries are bitch to mark really quickly though so i surely lost at least few seconds trying to hit mediterranean sea instead of malta . 
  i 'm surprised we are not dark red . 
  doing any business in poland is a bureaucratic nightmare . 
  http://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-18-at-5.18.31-am.png as we can see in this photo solar energy clearly seems like a logical energetical choice for poland . 
  poland did not sent chopin to exile when he was 20 . 
  in fact , whole poland throughout xix century ( [ except 1807-1815 when it was a french puppet state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_warsaw ) ) was [ occupied by kingdom of prussia , austrian empire and russian empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_uprising i mean , it really * is n't * common history knowledge outside poland ? 
   there has not been a war in europe for 70 years til balkans are not in europe . 
   a gay man cracked the nazi enigma code during world war ii [ yeah . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henryk_zygalski ) i know , it 's not really relevant to this discussion , though i ca n't help but react when i see this bullshit `` britons cracked enigma '' over and over again . 
  how polish police having communist/russian bias would n't be a bad thing ? 
   500000 jews died on his watch . 
  not exactly . 
  horthy always refused to give out hungarian jews to germans . 
  that jews were killed * after * germans took over hungary in 1944 when horthy tried to join allies like romania did . 
  also hungary refused to provide germany any help in 1939 invasion of poland and then gave help to many polish refugees . 
  though that 's more hungarian prime minister [ p\u00e1l teleki 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a1l_teleki ) merit than horthy 's . 
  reagan have statues in several polish cities too . 
  well , we even have parks and squares named after him . 
  so i guess it 's nothing unusual in central europe . 
   many live without gas , water or electricity in the area - where almost 100 per cent of its residents are unemployed and why should gas , water and electricity be provided for free for inhabitants of lunik ix while other citizens of kosice are still paying for it ? 
   i 'm against banning any political opinion that 's exactly what i said . 
  i 'm against banning any political opinion , but if nazism is banned , i do n't see any reason why communism should n't be banned aswell . 
  fuck nazis , and fuck communists . 
  there was not even such thing as romania until just 150 years ago . 
  before all the comradery thing eastern europe was better off than spain or portugal . 
  oh yea , that famous soviet economic help . 
  the old joke in poland was that we were giving meat to the ussr and in exchange for that they were taking coal from us . 
  what 's the matter in lithuania ? 
  why it looks so much like western europe unlike all the other countries with similar gdps per capita ? 
   far-right nuts with their conspiracy theories are you implying mazowiecki was n't the main creator of a deal with commies ?
