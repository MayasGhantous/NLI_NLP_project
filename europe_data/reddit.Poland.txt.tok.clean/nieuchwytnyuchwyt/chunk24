  man , it 's even stated in the very article you are commenting under :  mr mazowiecki was one of the architects of the `` round table '' talks , between communist leaders and opposition , paving the way for elections in 1989 . 
  so ( at least according to this link ) , countries like poland , hungary or croatia are in neither europe . 
  are they in the `` third distinct europe '' ? 
  or maybe not even in europe at all ? 
  unfortunately , you wo n't get any of these questions answered in this article . 
   no poland on this list why i 'm not even surprised . 
  greece . 
   where apparently more people are using firefox on desktops than using idevices oh , i 'm pretty sure that 's the case in poland . 
  you 're not wrong , azog . 
  you 're just an asshole . 
   india developed ? 
  really ? 
  india is like the very definition of a ` third world country ' . 
  you could argue about china though , and japan and south korea are certainly ` developed ' . 
   all colonizing states have some territory left elsewhere . 
  exactly . 
  turkey have some territory left in europe just like france have some territory left in south america , and spain some in africa . 
  that does n't mean we call france a south american nation , or spain an african nation . 
  [ hungary . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations ), 
  not really, 
  if you live in eastern poland you get your booze from ukraine . 
   i 'd like to use a different example but unfortunately fascism is the only one which is so indisputably a mis-step and something so well known . 
  communism, 
   racism gets worse in tough economic times no shit, 
   3 former soviet republics i wonder which ones . 
  baltic states perhaps ? 
  ninja edit : no , it 's belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine . 
  yeah , crippling military potential of europe . 
  that surely would convince russia or china . 
   actually , romania is on par with most former eastern bloc countries in terms of gdp actually , in terms of gdp romania is far behind every other former eastern bloc country in the eu except bulgaria . 
  that anti-semitic capaign was really just an extension of the power struggle in late sixties between `` liberal '' and `` nationalist '' factions of the communist party . 
  anti-roma comments in / r/worldnews are nothing compared to nearly anywhere else on the internet . 
  yeah , millions of czech sailors , conquistadors and slave traders were well known around the world for their cruelty and ruthlessness . 
  in romania . 
  what about the rest of europe ? 
  * lukashenko & last dictatorship in europe . 
  you can still feel spirit of soviet times there . 
  * more people there speak russian than belarussian * half of its territory used to be ours before wwii , and all of belarus was under control of polish-lithuanian commonwealth * many people in western poland have grandparents born in what is now belarus , and there is still large polish minority left there , especially near grodno . 
  they are also kinda badly treated by belarussian authorities . 
  * cheap cigarettes and alcohol . 
  there were also poles left in soviet union after the war , so it 's not really that hard for a pole to sympathise with hungarians on trianon . 
  larger trunk , same car size . 
  i find this line of thinking wrong . 
  after all what happened the last time when european indigenous genetics was significantly changed ? 
  that 's right , decline of roman empire and the dark ages . 
  sure , they were nazi collaborators and waffen ss soldiers . 
  but at the same time they were fighting against evil totalitarian empire which invaded their country in 1940 . 
  just for that reason i would consider them heroes ( though not the ones who commited war crimes ) . 
  we do n't give shit to finland for fighting against ussr in wwii , even though they were technically on the same side as axis , because their cause was rightful . 
  well , that 's the real communism . 
  or rather exactly what communism always becomes when someone try to implement it in real world . 
  usually accompanied by mass killings , and maybe a bit of genocide . 
  and majonez in polish . 
  high five . 
   and the polish were at least as antisemite as the germans no doubt . 
  and it was n't something unusual . 
  every nation in europe before wwii was more or less antisemitic , and unlike germany antisemitism in poland was primarily for economical , not racial reasons . 
   lust look at the jedwabne massacre [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedwabne_pogrom they even tried to blame the germans for this massacre `` some jews joined a soviet militia overseeing deportations organized by the nkvd . 
  at least one witness testimony says that during round-ups , armed jewish militiamen were seen to be guarding those prepared for deportation to siberia . 
  a total of 22,353 poles ( entire families ) were deported from the vicinity . 
  [ ... ] the nazis distributed propaganda in the area , [ 21 ] revealing crimes committed by the soviets in eastern poland and saying that jews might have supported them . 
  [ ... ] on the morning of july 10 , 1941 , by the order of mayor marian karolak and the town 's german gendarmerie , [ 26 ] a group of polish men from around jedwabne and neighboring settlements was assembled . '', 
  of course it was a horrible massacre , and that jews were indeed killed by poles . 
  but it was n't that poles one day spontaneously decided to kill the jews for no reason at all , the german presence heavily influenced that events . 
  nevertheless it became a `` token massacre '' so people like you can say `` ha , you see !, 
  throughout the war poles ( stirred up by germans ) killed 400 jews in a mob , they were literally as bad as german nazis who in camps built specifically for this purpose murdered 6,000,000 of them ! '' . 
  interesingly enough , the same people always seem to forget that it were poles who saved the most jews during the war , despite saving jews being punishable by death in german-occupied poland . 
   typical polish catholic lies by a bunch of antisemites !!, 
  typical comment with score below threshold ^ edit : ^ spelling, 
   we did n't play appeasement with mother russia after wwii you did . 
  [ in 1945 in yalta . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal#yalta ) sure , it were french and brits who we were allied with and betrayed by , but you were there too . 
  well , it 's such a shame that [ every ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward ) [ single ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_fields ) [ attempt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_korea ) to create an alternative global egalitarian economic system without states or money ended either in brutal dictatorship , genocide , or both . 
  it was proven by history that communist theory does n't work in practice . 
  it 's an perfect and ideal system - until you include the fact that people are not mindless automata . 
  both are totalitarian regimes which caused deaths of millions of people . 
  my country heavily suffered from both - and while nazi occupation was more severe , communist one was longer and its effects are very visible even today . 
  for me both ideologies are equally evil . 
  and supporting communists in 2013 - oh , that 's the lack of historical and politico-philosophical knowledge !, 
   communist ?!, 
  well , not strictly speaking - it 's an anarchist site after all . 
  but hold on minute . 
  there are news from [ 2 ] greece , [ 3 ] czech republic , [ 4 ] cyprus among others that the communists are gaining more popularity . 
  what if in the future there will be few euro-communist countries or anarchist countries ? 
  surely , you ca n't just disregard them based on cold-war era ` common sense ' . 
  there are news from [ greece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_dawn_%28greece%29 ) , [ hungary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) among others that the far right is gaining more popularity . 
  what if in the future there will be few neo-nazi countries ? 
  surely , you ca n't just disregard them based on wwii era ` common sense ' . 
  you see , your logic is flawed . 
  should we now also post here articles from neo-nazi websites ? 
  til poland is not the world . 
  of course there is no truly balanced newspaper in poland ( and sadly , as for today , no high quality either ) but i 'd say dziennik gazeta prawna . 
  they are n't perfect ( and they are a bit right-wing which depending on whether you are a typical reddit user or me is a bad or a good thing ) , but unlike wyborcza at least they are not publishing blatant lies . 
  if you asked me few years ago i 'd say rzeczpospolita but unfortunately that 's not the case anymore . 
  there were times when it was n't ? 
  it always was a leftist circlejerk , even when i was lurking . 
  it 's more like a polish `` bild '' . 
  but worse . 
  well , their really biased , unfair and misleading coverage of internal news and politics is what bugs me the most .
