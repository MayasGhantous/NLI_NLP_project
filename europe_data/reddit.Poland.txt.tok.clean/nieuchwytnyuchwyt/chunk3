  edit : and i do n't think you have replied to the one of my posts you have intended to . 
   every nobleman was more or less ethnic lithuanian , polonized widely during 1602 - 1772 period . 
  so by the time of the early 20th century conflict they were alrady polish , seeing as it were their great-great-grandfathers , who became polonised . 
  while most of poles were indeed resettled after the war , [ there are many poles living in lithuania till today . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ), 
  so what ? 
  should any nation be able to claim cities inhabited by other nationalities only because they feel like it ? 
   lviv clearly has a continuous history , starting from king danilo which means absolutely nothing , as it was a small , irrelevant town until poles have made it what it became during the following 600 years . 
  then ukrainians were given it from stalin after the ww2 because he felt humilated he was unable to conquer it during the polish-bolshevik war 20 year earlier , and they suddenly act as if it was the ukrainian kaaba since prehistory . 
  well , i too regret that the original polish cities of wilno and lw\u00f3w are n't in poland anymore . 
  that does n't mean i would like to see us take the cities , which are inhabited by ukrainians and lithuanians nowadays * back * . 
  keep derailing the thread . 
  and this is relevant to anything i said exactly how ? 
  i was n't talking about early , pagan grand duchy , though it surely would make an interesting discussion as well . 
  i was discussing with lithuanians who were absurdally claiming ( both in this thread , and in real world in interwar ) that wilno being the capital of the grand duchy makes it a natural capital of lithuanian ** nation state ** . 
  throughout history , the lithuanian language has gradually diminished in importance in grand duchy , until the late commonwealth period , when it was spoken only by few peasants on the baltic shore . 
  by that time the area around wilno and city itself was firmly polish - interestingly while city got lithuanised after lithuanian takeover in 1939 , the countryside around the city remains this way till today . 
  grand duchy - especially in late period - had very little to do with the small , baltic language speaking nation calling themselves `` lithuanians '' . 
  ah yes , the war in which ** civilians ** of lw\u00f3w have defended the city against ukrainians . 
  there is even a big cemetery of fallen defenders which was finally renovated a few years ago ( though without the original `` to you , poland - always faithful '' inscription ) . 
  anyhow , surely it 's not the best example to support your cause , is n't it ? 
  also , there were notable ukrainian forces allied with poles in a war with bolsheviks . 
   is that what you 're being taught in school ? 
  heh , after discussing with many lithuanians today i really do wonder what * you * are being taught in school . 
  returning to topic , that 's what you can learn by checking every single census done in that city before lithuanians occupied it in 1939 - they were done by russians , germans and poles and all brought similar results , so we can assume there was no falsyfying results on a large scale . 
   is it justified ? 
  are putin 's actions in crimea justified ? 
  are they right ? 
  if crimea was taken from russia in january 2014 by turkey and given to ukraine , and then in late february 2014 russians did their stealth invasion then maybe your comparison would be justified . 
  oh , and some very important to russians city like st. petersburg would have to be located in crimea as well . 
  tough luck though , you have to find some different analogy . 
   but poland held vilnius for 20 fucking years . 
  oh yeah , that 2 % of lithuanians in wilno . 
  i wonder what would happen if we considered every city with a 2 % ethnic minority to be somehow `` occupied '' . 
   now that i think about it , you guys got everything you deserved in ww2 . 
  now that i think about it , you guys got everything you deserved during your 50 years of soviet occupation . 
  feel even now ? 
   but still , to many people in vilnius ( which is almost purely lithuanian now congrats on successful colonisation . 
  we did similarly on areas of former eastern germany . 
  and there are still 20 % of poles there . 
  and when i was a few years ago , everyone seemed to understand polish . 
  seems that even after 70 years not everything about wilno was dissolved in vilnius . 
   you are not welcome . 
  ... and lose all that tourism monies ? 
  no way poor , eastern european lithuania would afford anything like that . 
  tell that to lithuanians . 
  that does n't really matter anymore , by now the city was lithuanised and lost its importance for contemporary polish culture , so for all i care they can have their capital in vilnius if they wish . 
  [ the only thing i would want from lithuania is autonomy for polish minority \\ ( or majority in some areas \\ ) on territories they grabbed in 1939 . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ) unfortunately , i do n't think it 's possible . 
   they held our capital for 20 years shame you have not chosen san francisco as your capital , it had similar ammount of lithuanians in 1920 as wilno . 
   like first poland 's president was a lithuanian , while his brother was one of the guys who signed lithuania 's independence act . 
  or perhaps his brother was a lithuanian pole who tried to build a lithuanian nation . 
  he has also commited suicide in '30s . 
   wtf is this shit ? 
  polish name of wilno region . 
   please tell me when have poland held vilnius before braking suwalki agreement ( two days after signing it ) ? 
  throughout over half of 1919 and most of 1920 . 
   well , we 're going to have to revisit the continuity of histories a lot of cities all over the world if that 's your standard . 
  well , i do n't even consider warsaw to be continnuous with it 's pre-war namesake , so yes , that perhaps is my standard . 
   no , see there again is the passive aggressiveness , stemming from an inability to see things from the others ' point of view . 
  upa was fighting against the nazis and the soviets and that constituted the vast , vast majority of its actions in 1943-1953 . 
  against the nazis , soviets ** and poles ** . 
  and instead of allying with poles also fighting this noble fight against nazi and soviet occupants , they have also fought with armia krajowa and murdered polish civilians . 
  the good things you did do n't make the bad things you did less bad . 
  from what i read , the 60,000-100 ,000 killed estimate seems to be closest to the truth . 
  there are some publications with higher figures , but they seem to be exaggerated . 
   many ukrainians deny that the massacre was ordered or approved by upa leadership of course they deny it , that would show your oh glorious , totally-not-nazi-genocidal-maniacs upa heroes in a bad light . 
  sometimes i wonder why we even bother still supporting your country . 
  some football fans fly a banner remembering the old lw\u00f3w brutally destroyed by soviets after the war - suddenly a big shitstorm everywhere . 
  you build statues of mass murderers , and celebrate their actions - and no one bats an eye . 
  that i did . 
  the people who founded the damn country , lithuanian nobility , have spoken polish since the 15th-16th century . 
   i have n't experienced that . 
  most people i know who are actually from lviv recognize the city 's rich polish history . 
  it is an old and ancient ukrainian citizen , but it has been under polish rule and had a polish population for far longer . 
  well , we have met different ukrainians then . 
   relocated ? 
  yes , relocated . 
  the city was almost completely burned down in 1350 by lithuanian raid . 
  it was rebuilt from scratch . 
  the only thing lw\u00f3w had in common with the settlement of danilo was the name and general area of location . 
   and all the positive aspects of its struggle . 
  yeah , positive for ukrainians . 
  like ethically cleansing the area of volhynia from non-ukrainians and other undesirables . 
  quite easy to understand when you look at it from ukrainian point of view after all . 
   it actually was n't . 
  my bad , i have replied to so many posts today i might have lost track . 
   so i cleared up your confusing sentence which made it seem like only ruthenian and polish was spoken . 
  there was also tatar , german , armenian , yiddish and many other languages spoken . 
  you ca n't seriously expect me to enumerate each one of them . 
   here you 're talking about the official language used for documentation ( which in medieval europe did not include widely spoken vernaculars ) , but in the sentence above you simply said that the grand duchy of lithuania was a `` old ruthenian and polish speaking country '' . 
  and it was . 
  ( proto - ) lithuanian was spoken in a small area near the baltic sea , similar to what is now lithuania . 
  old ruthenian was spoken in remaining , much bigger and more populous part of the country . 
  polish was spoken by the nobility and ruling class , with some small pockets along the country - including the capital area of wilno . 
  i do n't see anything confusing here . 
  as i said in other post , the city has changed hands numerous times in a period after the german withdrawal . 
  in fact , you have written it yourself too . 
   the city was briefly controlled by polish self-defence units which were driven out by advancing soviet forces . 
   vilnius changed hands again during the polish-soviet war and the lithuanian wars of independence : it was taken by the polish army , only to fall to the soviet forces again .
