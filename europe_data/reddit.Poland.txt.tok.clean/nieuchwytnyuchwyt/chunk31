  that 's how , relatively to wages , life in poland feels . 
  yes , people * survive * . 
  that 's nicely put indeed . 
   which means the money to cover the living costs is there if you suspend all the other state services , sure . 
   people 's acceptance of such a system . 
  such a system would either provide a laughably unreasonable ammount of money not even covering basic living expenses , or would result in such a high tax burden on anyone working , working would stop being a reasonable thing to do . 
  either way it being a huge drain to economy while providing little to no benefits . 
  basic income in a country with a wages/income ratio like poland is an idea even more laughable and ridiculous than communism . 
  either way , it 's nice that you are so enthusiastic about it , feel free to promote it in france where conditions there are way more suitable for that . 
  because anything more would bankrupt the country . 
  with a $ 200-250 basic income we could perhaps somehow balance the budget on current deficit levels - that is , if we scrapped all the currently existing welfare systems . 
  to clarify :  why would bi be 4-5 times lower if living costs are only 20-30 % lower ? 
  for the exact same reason the current polish wages are 4-5 times lower while living costs are only 20-30 % lower . 
  ever wondered why so many poles emigrated to the other eu countries ? 
   people in those countries do n't need hundreds of euros a month of course you need hundreds of euros per month in poland , and that 's only in order to have somewhere to live and something to eat . 
   the living costs are lower than in western europe yes , the living costs are lower - by 20-30 % . 
  on the other hand , basic income would be 4-5 times lower , otherwise the state would quickly bankrupt . 
  all that considered it * would * be an useless and harmful idea if implemented in poland - though perhaps it could work in some other country with a more convenient wages/prices ratio like sweden or switzerland . 
  it sounds like russian with non-slavic words . 
  for `` europe '' ? 
  well , that would be absurdal indeed . 
  no , not for `` europe '' , but for avoiding the soviet occupation later on and miserably disastrous decades of imposed communist regime that fucked the country up in every way imaginable . 
  if completely avoiding it meant enduring 6 more months to a year of german occupation , it would end up as a big net gain for our nation from 2015 perspective and i doubt anyone around here would think twice before taking that deal . 
  to sumup , i * wish * ( in a context mentioned in the previous paragraph ) war on the eastern front lasted a bit longer if it meant it would be our us/british allies who entered poland ( and all the other countries in central europe ) first and liberated it , instead of soviet co-belligerents who merely replaced one occupation with another one . 
  of course an even more ideal situation would be the war going exactly how it went , and then ussr getting the fuck out of our country , but this scenario seems too far removed from reality , as it 's incompatibile with an inherent imperialist nature of any russian state . 
  a russian jew , nevertheless . 
   ok whatever , keep playing dumb . 
  i 'm not playing dumb , i literally do n't understand what you are trying to say there besides wanting to sound offensive . 
  regarding the ez accession , sweden is in the exact same situation poland is . 
   poles , ukrainians , lithuanians and germans worked very heard for my people to abhor them for ever and ever . 
  yeah , we dared not to be docile subjects of your shitty empires , i can totally see why would that be the case . 
   what i 've gathered is that you 're willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of your countrymen to live in a utopia . 
  yeah , an `` utopia '' that most of europe bar few unlucky countries experienced . 
  til having a normal country instead of an imposed totalitarian idiotic circus under enemy occupation is an `` utopia '' . 
   how communist of you . 
  i have an impression you were trying to insult me here , however for that you would have to make sense - saying random words with a negative connotation is not enough . 
  we can only * stall * it , sure , but we can stall it until kingdom come with minimal effort . 
  for example , joining the erm2 is not mandatory , and it 's impossible to join the ez without that . 
  that means they assimilated nicely . 
  lpr had about as much in common with neo-nazism as partia razem has with neo-stalinism . 
  yeah , as opposed to russia , where it 's 1 out of 1 . 
  i think you see my point by now . 
  [ there are many parties on us ballots as well . 
  ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350294208361/minnesota-ballot-question-001.gif ) the number of patries on ballot is not indicative of anything . 
   stating that staying in the german meat grinder any further would have been preferable is what 's crazy . 
  if enduring a few months more of it meant avoiding 40 years of soviet occupation later it does n't seem so crazy anymore . 
  it could easily end up as a net gain - we are talking about ~ 70 years of independence with a bit worse starting conditions vs 45 years of shitty , mildly opressive , miserable occupation with also bad starting conditions , and only 25 years of independence here , and that 's a big difference . 
   seems that russophobia had been ingrained in your society so deep russians have worked hard for hundreds of years in order for that to happen . 
   calling white black and black white . 
  except * both * alternatives are bad here . 
  which one is worse , it depends on many mostly unpredictable factors . 
   take my words back . 
  and you say this kind of thinking is widespread ? 
  that 's mass schizophrenia right here . 
  what 's wrong about looking for ways in which we could avoid one of the worst periods in polish history and the societal and economical disaster soviet occupation was ? 
   examples that 's the combined death toll of actions of the 1944-56 quisling regime in soviet-occupied poland . 
  some examples : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 9346 ) #restoration _ of_polish_sovereignty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august%c3%b3w_roundup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministry_of_public_security_ ( poland ) #the _ stalinist_reign_of_terror https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pozna%c5%84_1956_protests people notable enough to have their own wikipedia article , who were murdered by the quisling regime : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kategoria:osoby_skazane_na_kar%c4%99_%c5%9bmierci_w_polsce_1944-1956_wskutek_represji_politycznych_i_mord%c3%b3w_s%c4%85dowych https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kategoria:polskie_ofiary_represji_stalinowskich_stracone_w_polsce_ludowej_1944-1956  who nevertheless got to live , make progeny  and maybe even come back . 
  yeah , after poland was liberated in 1989 . 
   oh thank god , maybe you 're not completely hopeless . 
  sure , if we lost 10 million citizens and had our country completely flattened , we probably would n't be better off nowadays even if we gained additional 40 years of independence and development opportunity in exchange for that . 
  i doubt that would be the case though . 
   i meant if people would actually prefer having hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions more of their countrymen ( women , children ) , possibly their own grandparents , than live under the russkies . 
  `` living under the ruskies '' also included dozen of thousands of polish civilians killed , and hundreds of thousands of political refugees . 
  it also completely fucked up of the entire polish society and our economy for a period of 45 years . 
  overall , it 's definitely quite high on the list of worst things to ever happen to poland . 
  that said , at some point ( when going into millions additional causalities , the war would have to last for many more years for that to happen ) avoiding it indeed ceases to be a preferable outcome . 
   it still needs to be grounded in reality does n't it ? 
  that was * your * scenario , perhaps you should have thought about it before you posted . 
   do n't even ... 
  does everyone in poland think this way ? 
  about what , the 1944-89 soviet occupation of poland ? 
  pretty much yes , while not at * any * cost , avoiding this sad and dark situation would be the most preferable . 
  whether prolonging the war would be a reasonable price - i 'm torn down on that as it heavily depends on the `` by how long the war would be prolonged ? '', 
  factor . 
   are you for real ? 
  how do you imagine soviet troops engaging the wehrmacht if they stop ate the border ? 
  how do you imagine the soviet advance being halted without reaching a treaty ? 
  i assumed that 's what you meant by `` should have left you to the germans . '', 
  remark . 
  you have proposed this scenario in the first place , not me . 
   oh you mean all two of them , with the third being months down the road that 's still three more than soviet union used to defeat germany in otl . 
  and defeating germany would be a priority over defeating japan , which already has long lost the maritime war , was starving and its surrender was a matter of time . 
   prolonging the war by 6 months would reasonably have had killed 250,000 more . 
  that 's katyn x10 . 
  if that would be the ammount of soldiers killed , it certainly would be an acceptable ( even if harsh ) price for avoiding 45 years of occupation of our country . 
  it 's all about what 's at stake , obviously no soviet occupation and no additional war casualties would be the most preferable situation , but sadly that 's not how it works . 
   also your confidence in a quick anglo-american liberation without the ussr engaging 80 % of the german forces in the east is characteristically hilariously naive . 
  it 's not like the german-soviet war did n't exist in such scenario , even if the soviet troops stopped their offensive on the 1938-soviet-border in 1944 , it 's unlikely that any kind of the peace treaty between the two sides of the conflict would be reached . 
  western front would still happen , and even if it encountered significantly stronger resistance than in otl , there still were american nukes that would sooner or later ensure the end of the war . 
  maybe it would even take until 1946 , who knows , in any case there is no way that additional overall damage caused by prolonged german occupation would be any bigger than damage caused by 45 lost years of soviet occupation . 
  the difference in our total losses would be negligible . 
  by 1945 , germans already exterminated allmost all the polish jews ( who made up about half of our wartime loses ) , and no similar organized extermination attempts in regards to the polish population existed . 
  when chosing between the soviet occupation in winter 1945 , and american/british * liberation * in summer 1945 , anyone sane would chose the latter . 
  nobody cares what they * want * . 
  if they are fucking up other countries to achieve that ( which they do now , and 've been doing for centuries ) , then fuck them . 
  yeah , if only ... we would have been * actually * liberated by americans and brits a few months later if that was the case . 
  i 'm quite sure waiting those additional few months , while not the nicest thing in the world , would be worth avoiding 45 years of soviet occupation . 
  `` murzyn '' is not a racist slur , it 's a completly neutral word for a black person . 
  oh , i think you misunderstood me , i obviously meant that resigning from the `` free movement of eu citizens within union '' principle would do so , not the actual process of polish people returning home . 
  well , poland will gladly take them back , after all `` we 'll make the emmigrants return to poland '' is pretty much an unanimous axiom during the every electoral campaign since 2004 .
