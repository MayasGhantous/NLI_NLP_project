  unless groceries prices in the part of germany where you live are twice as high as in berlin , groceries would be nowhere near that range , but rather the 30-50 % one i already mentioned . 
  restaurants might be one of the few things where your `` 1/3 , 1/4 '' figure would be correct , so i 'd say it checks out . 
   do you know how much does the total aid per person cost ? 
  around 1400pln per month , which would be about 350 $ . 
  that 's already way higher than any social benefits provided to * citizens * . 
   you take into account that the prices in poland are 1/3 to 1/4 of that of germany ( source : travel to poland often ) , you must be travelling to some different poland than i live in then , because prices in poland are 30-50 % lower than in germany tops , and that 's only for domestic-made products like food or rent , imported products cost the same as in germany or even 5-10 % more . 
   250 $ would be on the same standard oh , i wish it was , nobody would ever consider emigration from poland if that was the case . 
  alas , 1000 $ in germany is at least two or three times more in pucharsing power parity than 1000pln ( 250 $ ) in poland . 
   racists in eastern europe . 
  i apologize for the farmers yeah , definitely salty , because as it turns out the rest of europe is not germoney vassals yet only because they threw spare change at them for a few years . 
   yeah the us helped you very well after ww2 the us already helped us , even if sadly not immediately . 
  they were funding the anti-soviet resistance in poland throughout the cold war , and if only for that reason reagan deserves every statue and street named after him in poland . 
   are just some farmers in eastern europe i can literally see the salt flowing through you , hillarious : ddd, 
  we have our us friends to look for , thanks a lot . 
  germany can go fuck itself with their current attitude though . 
  yeah , i was talking about those . 
  the ads paid by the government party that kept being displayed in my mobile browser throughout the last month suggested otherwise . 
  go go , independent catalonia , we wo n't overtake spain in population and become eu 's top5 biggest nation without you . 
  you guys have my full support if only because of that reason . 
  you can only live in one city in any given time anyway . 
  yes , but there 's * absolutely * nothing special about the growth in europe in the industrial revolution period . 
  it actually was rather bland , as far as population growth streaks go . 
  no , actually a much more worrying thing is happening , as the homelands of europeans slowly cease to be their homelands . 
  was it ? 
  if anything , europe was exceptional in * how low * its growth was since the renaissance . 
  [ exhibit 1 , ] ( http://matrix.msu.edu/hst/fisher/hst150/unit1/mod/imgs/chart3.jpg ) notice how europe , india and china are all pretty much on par until china experiences industrial-revolution growth rate * 100 years before the industrial revolution * , and how unlike either china or india , europe is the only one * not * to experience the second , even faster phrase of growth . 
  [ exhibit 2 ] ( http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/popgrowthsince_1500.jpg ) , this chart is neater visually but sadly it only has half of europe marked instead of entire continent , which clouds the direct comparison with the other two historical old world population centers . 
  on the other hand you can easily see in here that even western europe * alone * was more populous than entire africa way before the industrial revolution . 
  it lost a war in large part because various peoples who made it up did n't care about the a-h empire at all . 
  for example , the only thing polish troops from austrian-occupied part of poland fought for since 1914 , was eventual restoration of poland , and they notoriously changed sides in whichever way suited this goal the most . 
   says putin kek, 
   you mind if i quote you in shitredditsays personally , i would consider it a badge of honour if someone quoted my posts there . 
   poland is reluctant to accept almost any migrants , except ukrainians and ethnic poles from the former soviet union . 
  good , i hope it will stay our official policy even after we become rich enough to be a target of the mass migration . 
  post the source of such revelation , as i 'm very interested where you found such basic contradiction of scientific consensus . 
  by chance , do you also recall whether africa was more populous than india or china in that source as well ? 
  because even * before * the industrial revolution europe was pretty much on par with either , and european growth during the industrial revolution was nothing exceptional in the world as china was growing in similar pace since the 17th century . 
  you are not supposed to walk on the fucking motorway . 
  that alone would qualify for a legal fine in my country , are they above the law ? 
  throughout history since the ancient times , africa as a whole had * less * population than either europe , india or china . 
  africa might be huge , but most of it is not really that suitable for human settlement . 
  and considering that for the first time in several thousand years , africa has already overtook europe , and is getting close to india and china as well , i 'd say they are * already * reaching the overpopulation , i do n't even want to imagine how situation there will look like when they actually will reach 4 billion . 
  we ca n't take in all the surplus ones , that 's for sure . 
  economic left/right : 6.75 social libertarian/authoritarian : 0.26, 
  who knows , maybe he eats only one . 
  * pierogi * is a plural form after all . 
   we werent kicked out from nowere goa, 
  yeah , the horrors and desperation of * being in hungary * . 
  i doubt any of us could possibly imagine it . 
  i think you commented under the wrong article , as those are refugees fleeing from areas of poland occupied by * soviet union * , not areas of poland occupied by * nazi germany * , so in fact persia * was * the first safe country for them . 
  you could at least read the fucking link . 
   in the current decade , there have been more victims of christian fanatics than islamic fanatics ( edit ) in europe . 
  on the other hand , during the last 12 years ... or perhaps during the last 3 years , you 'll easily notice that the situation is quite the opposite . 
  convenient goalposts , innit ?

  yet i 'm seeing `` hungary/czechia/poland want only benefits but when it 's time to commit suicide together because papa germany decided so , they suddenly do n't want to be solidary anymore '' used * as an argument * all the time in here . 
  it works both ways . 
   will be condemned by every major party in germany . 
  despite the apparently popular in germany opinion , other european countries are not your vassals , and the eu is not the fourth reich . 
  nobody gives a shit what `` every major german party '' thinks about that , for they have no power in foreign countries . 
   czech republc and hungary are just ignoring european law on the contrary , * germany * is ignoring the european law . 
  \u010cr and hungary are doing their best in upholding it , despite official statements coming from germany that have the eu law in blatant disregard . 
  it seems that germany wants only benefits of eu ( pathetic german efforts in dumping to other countries surplus migrants they themselves invited ) , but not the shared responsibility of maintaining the security of external eu borders , stopping the illegal immigration and process the refugees in accordance with eu procedures . 
  i really hope there will be consequences for germany . 
  the two months after the soviet-lithuanian treaty in 1920 aside , it indeed * never * was a part of * republic of * lithuania before 1991 . 
  i have a `` wat '' reaction to your `` wat '' , is this subject really taught this poorly in lithuanian schools ? 
  anyhow , counting all the years in which either country controlled the city the republic of lithuania overtook the republic of poland only in 2009 . 
  damn basques , still acting like they moved in yesterday and refusing to replace their culture with a spanish one . 
  he meant `` before '' . 
  lithuanian accent in polish is hardly distinguishable from russian accent in polish . 
  also , your language does n't look like russian when * written * , but when you guys * speak it * , you sound as if you were speaking this non-slavic language with a russian accent . 
  lithuanian sounds like russian with non-slavic words for me as well ( in a way greek sounds like spanish with non-romance words ) . 
  that 's the ammount of * extra * money they receive , in addition to shelter , food and other basic needs already provided in state facilities . 
  i fully agree with such proposal . 
  let 's standarize the amount of aid for asylum seekers all over europe - the current polish levels being the new , paneuropean standard . 
  this way , choosing countries based purely on better social welfare conditions will end . 
  greece ? 
  to get to hungary they need to pass at least * four * different , completely safe countries : turkey , greece , fyro macedonia and serbia . 
  they illegally enter hungary through serbia . 
  would serbians entering hungary in a similar way be entitled to a refugee status as well ? 
  til hungary borders turkey and greece . 
  well , i recall it indeed did back in middle ages . 
  to the country they entered hungary from . 
  unless they teleported , it 's not a war-torn country and `` fleeing '' it does not qualify for a refugee status . 
  the polish representatives , who have just lost half of their country to the soviet union , were n't the ones who were making any decision there , nor are they signed on the final treaty . 
  it was up to the signatories to listen to their biased advice , or to completely ignore them . 
   thought we were talking about the recent chechen wars . 
  aka chechen independence wars . 
  chechen wars are no different from polish uprisings against russia in 19th century . 
   former eastern germany that you seized in 1945 ? 
  `` we '' have `` seized '' ? 
  we never had anything to say in that regard . 
  the basis for border changes in that area was potsdam agreement , and we were neither a party nor a signatory of it . 
   why would i insist that russia never invaded poland ? 
  you just insisted that russia never invaded chechnya , after that i would expect any kind of revisionism from you . 
   there are plenty of places from which you did n't withdraw . 
  none of which are under control of poland nowadays either . 
   the important point is what is your internationally recognised territories 30 years ago estonia was an `` internationally recognized territory '' of soviet union , and 120 years ago eastern poland was an `` internationally recognized territory '' of russian empire . 
  `` international recognition '' has nothing to do with this issue . 
   you ca n't invade those .
