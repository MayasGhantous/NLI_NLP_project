  yeah , there are about 2-3 % of them . 
  mostly benefactors of the soviet occupation of our country and their offspring . 
   since when do you need wmd 's in order to execute pow 's ? 
  them dying of epidemics is well-documented . 
  the only thing suggesting it somehow was an `` execution '' which oddly looked like effects of contagious disease is your empty claim . 
   not russian sources , which have numbers up to 80k . 
  but yeah , i forgot '' russians ca n't be trusted '' you literally dismiss the polish sources in one post , and in the very next post you claim the russian ones . 
  coincidentally , you also have a `` russian empire '' flair on / r/russia , so it 's high time you finally stopped your obvious shilling . 
   how are you so sure that the pow 's that died in poland was not a deliberate execution ? 
  because i sincerely doubt we had a biological wmd programme decades ahead of the rest of the world we managed to keep secret to this day . 
  that , and the fact that neutral sources do not confirm this bold hypothesis . 
   let 's say that the average of 50k died 50k ? 
  `` average ? '', 
  the great majority of estimates is around 20k . 
  yes , many soldiers tended to die in powcamps due to various reasons . 
  for example , over 350,000 of german pows did n't return from the soviet union after ww2 either , so it seems that their conditions did n't really improve during that 20 year gap . 
   then you can treat katyn in the exact same way . 
  katy\u0144 was 1 ) a deliberate * execution * 2 ) of * allied officers * , who coincidentally made up a significant portion of polish intellectual elite 3 ) happened without an ( official ) state of war between our countries 4 ) was commited by the country that pretended to be `` allied '' with us as soon as a year later and denied everything . 
  it 's simply on entirely different level than our soldiers taken pow not recieving a proper medical treatment in a war-torn country . 
  surely , it sucks as well , but we really have way bigger atrocities to bitch about and it 's not like our resources are unlimited . 
   and what if there 's not enough evidence to support such a claim ? 
  between 1919 and 1921 , 46k polish soldiers were taken pow on the eastern front , only 26k returned home . 
  it 's official statistical data of the polish army , there 's not much to debate here . 
   poland wanted this to be a big deal russians have commited enough crimes against us during the last century , that we literally have dozens of more `` interesting '' cases and `` big deals '' to divert out attention to than 20k pows dead due to abysmal sanitary conditions . 
  neither party had the 1907 geneva convention signed back then , and they were n't killed intentionally but died of diseases - level of neglect is surely condemnable on both sides but hardly worthy of being a `` big deal '' , at least from our perspective . 
   there are far more sources ( international ) about the russians that died in poland well , in stark contrast with our situation , that 's literally * the only thing * russians can cling to in order to not seem completely evil , of course they care about it way more than we do . 
   should n't it be poland 's responsibility to ask about their own dead ? 
  yes , it 's called `` polish sources '' . 
  dokumenty i materia\u0142y ( victors behind barbed wire : polish prisoners of war , 1919 -- 1922, 
  well , considering that the `` neutral source '' on soviet pows was done by poles , and the analogue source on polish pows done by soviets , as you yourself mentioned , * does not exist * , i 'd say that yes , it 's certainly `` russian fault '' in this particular case . 
   there is no neutral source on how many poles actually died then . 
  which says more about russians than about us , as it seems that they not only were n't able to keep our pows alive , they were n't even able to keep tabs on how many of them they have taken . 
  but yes , we did neglect the soviet pows ( as thousands of them died of curable diseases ) , just like they neglected ours . 
   can do the same by asking where 20-80k russian soldiers went in 1921 ? 
  you are aware that in 1920 more polish soldiers wete lost in soviet powcamps than the other way around , right ? 
  all russia will recieve from poland will be a neatly framed letter with `` go fuck yourself '' written all over it . 
  i wonder why ancestors of those 3 million people kept immigrating here since the middle ages if it was so shit . 
  i honestly doubt jews as a nation have such masochistic tendencies . 
  and i do n't have a problem with that , but at some point he literally started to claim that it never had anything to do with poland and poles . 
  and that 's the kind of bullshit i did n't hear even from most hardcore upa supporters . 
  oh , that was supposed to be `` sarcasm '' ? 
  for me it looked more like a blatant attempt on falsyfying history , especially considering the subsequent posts of this particular user . 
  it 's a high time they finally stopped pretending that it 's an ancient ukrainian city and totally never had anything to do with poland . 
  it left me with a rather sour impression when i was on a trip there a few years ago . 
  if taking into account all the history of the city currently known as l'viv you conclude that it `` was n't polish '' , then you should also conclude that it has about as much to do with austria as salt lake city . 
  i really dislike inconsistent banter , and that 's the only reason i called you on it . 
   but what does it have to do with lemberg ? 
  well , `` lemberg '' is a german name of the city i 'm talking about , so i guess it has everything to do with it . 
   admit , warsaw does seem nice not really , it was destroyed in 1944 , though i 'm glad you are including new topics in this conversation as it was getting rather boring . 
  perhaps the fact that 65 % of its population was polish , it belonged to poland for over 500 years and was an important centre of polish culture and science would serve as a hint here . 
  i do n't recall similar facts being true in regards to austria . 
  oh , i was quite sure we are talking about l'viv / lw\u00f3w , i did n't notice the discussion diverted to vienna as well . 
  why do you keep bringing up a formerly polish and currently ukrainian city ? 
  what does austria have to do with it ? 
  you are not only boring mate , but also greatly mistaken regarding the intent of my original post . 
  what austria has to do with a polish city ? 
  sure , we also used this name . 
  after all latin was one of the official languages of the kingdom of poland . 
  and i never heard of a `` lwow '' either , perhaps you meant lw\u00f3w . 
  oh , are you proposing border changes now ? 
  only if we get lw\u00f3w back in exchange for that . 
  anyhow , i was simply correcting your baseless and ignorant statement , no need to be so insecure . 
  til lw\u00f3w was majority austrian and the second most important city of austria . 
  it would be nice it they tried to revive its polish past as well , as ukraine also seems to bid to link with poland . 
   we 're long past that point we might have already reached portugal and greece , but we are yet to overtake spain so we still have a bit to go to reach our pre-war * relative * wealth . 
   i think it 's pretty fair to point out that you could n't find a single case of actual refugees committing a terrorist attack . 
  i think it 's pretty fair to point out that i never claimed that '' * refugees * commited a terrorist attack '' in the first place either , but you seem pretty insistent on fighting strawmans even after your ridiculous `` american terrorists '' strawman failed . 
   there 's a long list of terrorist attacks committed in countries of the european union , and the vast , vast majority was committed by citizens of those countries without any kind of migrant background . 
  breivik 's attack aside , for whatever reason acts of domestic terrorism in europe tend to be way less ` spectacular ' than those with a clear muslim background . 
   yet you 're picking a handful of attacks that are tenuously connected to immigration , and use those as an argument against all immigration . 
  this discussion , while rather chaotic due to errant nature of your posts , still had a rather strong `` terrorist '' leitmotiv . 
  it 's only natural that this was what i was primarily refering to . 
   that seems to indicate that you 're much less interested in stopping terrorism than in stopping muslim immigration . 
  i 'm interested in stopping both , though regarding immigration it 's the `` unskilled and poor '' part which bothers me even more than `` muslim '' . 
  anyhow , as for now my particular country is safe both from `` terrorism '' and `` mass immigration of unskilled , culturally alien people '' issues , so i have a luxury on looking at them from a purely outside perspective , and i hope it will stay this way . 
   if terrorism was your main concern terrorism is only a symptom of an underlying bigger problem , and by no means my primary concern . 
   and actually deal with the issue instead of using it as an anti-immigration argument . 
  fortunately it 's not my issue to deal . 
  it seems that un did n't got the memo that the cold war ended yet . 
  we already have a defensive alliance . 
  it 's called `` nato '' . 
  those bases are not needed in us . 
  yes , that 's the `` and descendants of such immigrants '' part , congratulations . 
   what 's your solution to this problem ? 
  kick out not just all the immigrants , but also everybody whose parents immigrated to the european union ? 
  i * do n't * have a solution for that problem , for the mistakes that lead to it were made decades ago . 
  what i know is that continuing this situation and letting in even more unskilled , impoverished muslim immigrants certainly wo n't contribute to * improving * the situation in europe . 
   likewise , the most important thing that needs to happen to stop muslim refugees committing terrorist attacks in europe would be for such attacks to start in the first place . 
  they did n't ? 
  i do n't think i have to remind you that muslim immigrants from the middle east ( and descendants of such immigrants ) have already commited dozens of terrorist attacks in europe , including [ assasinations of public figures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theo_van_gogh ) , [ train bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ) , [ public transport bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_july_2005_london_bombings ) , or [ newspaper shootings . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_%c3%8ele-de-france_attacks ) inb4 `` refugees are not immigrants '' : of course they are . 
  they become no different from economic migrants the moment they leave the safe countries they initially escaped to for eu . 
   what are you proposing to do in order to stop american fundamentalist christians to commit terrorist attacks in europe ? 
  well , i guess the most important thing that needs to happen to * stop * the american fundamentalist christians commiting terrorist attacks in europe , a * conditio sine qua non * i 'd dare to say , would be for such attacks to * start * in the first place . 
  keep getting more and more ridiculous though . 
  ever heard of nation of islam ? 
  1993 wtc attack ? 
  many other separate incidents ? 
  anyhow , you are free to advocate whatever you wish . 
  i , personally , am not * that * radical .
