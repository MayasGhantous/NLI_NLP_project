   shortly after its defeat in the battle of warsaw , the retreating red army , in order to delay the polish advance , ceded the city to lithuania after signing the soviet-lithuanian treaty on 12 july 1920 . 
  12 july 1920 . 
  that 's the very first time lithuanians have ever controlled the city - and very few inhabitiants of it wanted them to at the time . 
  bolshevik ruse was to give the city to lithuania to avoid poland reconquering it , polish ruse was prepared by gen. \u017beligowski . 
  in the end we were all fucked 20 years later . 
   before that , it was part of russian empire , and not poland , before that it was part of commonwhealth , and before that it was part of ldk . 
  exactly . 
  so what would be the reason for it to belong to lithuania ? 
  it was already mentioned countless times that the ethnic composition was polish-jewish . 
  should aachen be a part of france only because it used to be charlemagne 's capital ? 
   the name of the city originated from the vilnia river . 
  [ 2 ] the name of the river derives from the lithuanian language word vilnis ( `` a surge '' ) or vilnyti ( `` to surge '' ) . 
  the city has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history the name of the city los angeles is of spanish rather than english origin , but that does n't mean it should belong to mexico , or spain . 
  the name of berlin is of slavic origin , but would claiming it by poland make any sense ? 
   it 's vilnius , not wilno it 's called the way inhabitiants of the city wish to call it . 
  in this case - vilnius today , wilno 80 years ago . 
  the highest extreme is 200,000 , i deliberately picked a number in a middle to avoid such accusation . 
   the violence was from both sides . 
  and the violence from ukrainians was much more common , widespread and severe . 
  ukrainians are also the only ones who are gloryfying preparators of violence . 
  preparators of akcja wis\u0142a - kbw , along with gen. \u015awierczewski killed by upa are considered to be soviet puppets and supporters of occupants , definitely not heroes . 
  well , seems that signing the suwa\u0142ki agreement was our biggest mistake then , considering lithuania has just taken wilno from us the two months before , and we would have to regain the city one way or another sooner or later . 
  also , i wonder why you have not bolded the most important part :  the most controversial issue -- the future of the city of vilnius -- was not explicitly addressed . 
  you have n't seen serbian ones . 
  mind i would n't * actually * want to see anything like that - just replied in the same way someone has replied to me with all this false equivalence . 
  at least those 200,000 ukrainians were still alive unlike the 100,000 poles upa has murdered in volhynia . 
  there were also more than 2,000,000 poles resettled from areas grabbed by ussr to the new-western poland , higher than that by an order of magnitude . 
  it was already mentioned in the post i was replying to , so i felt no need to . 
  yes , it was initially , though it was gradually diminishing since the 14-15th century . 
  lithuanian language was not an official language in grand duchy , unlike polish and old ruthenian . 
  an eloquent one we have here , i have to admit . 
   how many ancient grudges do you want to dredge up ? 
  i do n't want to dredge up any ancient grudges . 
  i just want ukrainians to stop pretending that l'viv is an old and ancient ukrainian city , always ukrainian for the last 50000 years and totally has nothing in common with poland nor it never had . 
  because that describes how most of my experiences with ukrainians regarding the city were . 
  yes , lemberg was belonging to the austo-hungary throughout the 19th century , but even then it still was a polish city , seat of a polish autonomical government of galicia , and the second biggest after warsaw centre of polish culture in the world . 
  in fact , lw\u00f3w was a polish city for all of its history since the city was relocated in 1356 , until the expulsion of poles by soviets in 1946 . 
  i would like ukrainians to finally recognize it someday . 
  and perhaps stop worshipping scum and criminals like bandera . 
  i do n't know how math works in your remote northern country , but i 'm quite sure that ( 1807-1794 ) + ( 1918-1815 ) is much closer to 100 than to 200 . 
  116 years , to be certain . 
   poznan do n't think so . 
  the only time in history when pozna\u0144 was german was for about 100 years in 19th century . 
  by that time , the most valuable part was already built . 
   gda\u0144sk again , it have belonged to poland during the time it prospered the most and the valuable parts were build . 
  though even then gda\u0144sk always had a german feel to it . 
  ... and even on such map danzig is polish . 
  accept it ? 
  while ukrainians who are supposed to be our `` friends '' treat the very same people who have genocided our compatriots during the ww2 as heroes ? 
  2006 called and wants its political climate back . 
  it 's a sentence i hope is not bullshit . 
  it was the iirp coat of arms on a banner instead of the current one that did it to me . 
  if they paid attention to such details , there might be more to it than the usual `` stupid ultras wreak havoc in foreign countries again '' narration . 
  else i might just like defending lost causes . 
  well , i guess something about our fan culture has gone terribly wrong at some point then . 
  insulting the opponent is the norm in polish football . 
   but to provoke . 
  well , that 's the very point of fan banners in general . 
  and knowing our ultras , they really ** do ** care about remembering and honouring the loss of the cities . 
  and again you too , my dear adversary , would find i 'm of the exact same opinion which i stated in this very thread though in a different post . 
   the point of this post , as i see it , is to show how stupid and inappropriate behaviour it is to go to the capital of other country and raise the revisionistic banner . 
  oh , but if you read my other posts in this thread you would know that i 'm of the exact same opinion . 
  i do * not * endorse such displays on football matches with foreign teams . 
  that 's too heavy banter artillery . 
  i find the enusing historical discussion in this thread very interesting though , especially the desperate though futile lithuanian efforts to prove they were right in the interwar conflict . 
  precisely , glad we agree there . 
  which means lithuanian claim to wilno/vilnius at the beginning of 20th century even more void , considering the ehnic composition of the city and countryside around it at the time which was polish majority , large jewish minority , small belarusian minority and negligible lithuanian minority . 
  and where i said anything like that ? 
  the city indeed was destroyed in 1350 - by a ** lithuanian ** duke liubartas demetrijus during his raid . 
  i 'll remind you that lithuanians were still pagan and had no connection to poland at the time . 
  [ i meant that there were many areas where both rural and urban population was polish which ended up on soviet part of the border . 
  the map uses german data from 1916 and deep red indicates polish majority . 
  soviet union had absolutely no right in redrawing the borders of poland , and yet it did it . 
  we have lost our eastern territories in an aggressive invasion of soviet union in 1939 . 
  we have gained our western territories as a war compensation after the country which inflicted tremendous damage upon our country , including murdering 20 % of our population was defeated in a defensive war . 
  defeated , by an odd twist of fate , by the very same country which has invaded and took the eastern half of our country in 1939 , so the compensation was also in some way for the areas they took from us . 
   conquered inherited . 
  though there was some fighting connected with securing the succession . 
  areas of wojew\u00f3dztwo ruskie , which roughly corresponds to eastern galicia were an integral part of poland since 1340 . 
  and i doubt there 's more than few buildings in lw\u00f3w dating before 1340 . 
   however the boarder would have been drawn , somebody would have gotten fucked over . 
  [ in that case poles did , as the border was drawn by stalin in a way which left the highest possible number of poles behind the border and still looked remarkably plausible . 
  map shows percentage of poles by county in 1931 . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/polish_language_frequency_in_poland_in_1931.png ) and i wo n't even mention that any redrawing of our border was an act of aggression as we were a sovereign country before the war . 
  no , it 's football banter disguised as remembrance . 
   well , if that 's the case , i 'd love to see german footbal fans in warsaw holding the banner with 2nd reich coat of arms saying `` stettin , breslau , danzig '' . 
  well , i 'd love to see that too . 
  maybe polish fans could reply with the a banner with the 3rd reich coat of arms saying `` auschwitz , treblinka , planned destruction of warsaw - we took our compensation '' or something like that . 
  people like you do n't realize the fundamental difference between those two situations . 
  the fact that someone considers the unjustified annexation of then polish cities 70 years ago unfair is not revisionism . 
  i am , along with most poles , of the exact same opinion . 
  what stalin did to our eastern border in 1945 was ** very ** unfair . 
  now , revisionim is saying that `` we should invade ukraine/lithuania and take lw\u00f3w / wilno back '' . 
  that 's a very silly and pointless idea and with abysmal level of support in poland . 
  it 's not possible to bring lw\u00f3w or wilno back , as they were changed into l'viv and vilnius respectively during the last 70 years . 
  polish flag over l'viv of 2014 wo n't make it lw\u00f3w again . 
  well , then all this banner is even less of an issue than i thought previously . 
   we could also talk about east prussia , if you insist on revisionism . 
  feel free to , the circumstances along us getting parts of east prussia , and us losing kresy were vastly different . 
  and i have n't seen a single pole in this thread even remotely talking about revisionism .
