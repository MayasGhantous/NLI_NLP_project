   so what 's the point ? 
  what do you gain from preoccupiing yourself with this stuff ? 
  and what do you gain from preoccupying yourself with * anything * ? 
  it 's still relevant , so people still care about it . 
  the simplest thing in the world . 
   i just read that order , there is not such list there . 
  oh , they are not mentioned from the name * in that order * - after all it was interpreted as an order to execute * absolutely all poles * so it would be a rather impractical thing to do . 
  [ the numbers come from nkvd archives ] ( http://www.memo.ru/history/polacy/00485-1.htm )  could you source that ? 
  [ here .

  ii , warszawa 2002  i highly doubt that soviet government would execute almost 1/7 of it 's polish population . 
  you are right , i also doubt it . 
  the soviet government executed * far more * than 1/7 of its polish population . 
   are you just trolling right now ? 
  what could you lead to such conclusion ? 
  in the 1939-41 period soviet occupation of poland was considerably harsher than the german one . 
  and considering that in the end about 6 million polish citizens died as a result of the german occupation , i do n't even want to wonder what would that number be , had soviet union kept its 39-41 extermination pace . 
  it would also be factually incorrect then , as not all the german soldiers committing atrocities during the ww2 were members , let alone supporters , of the nazi party . 
   are the polish really still that obsessed with ww2 or is it just my impression from / r/europe [ 1 ] ? 
  if 1/5 of your country got killed in ww2 ( along with more or less complete destruction of infrastructure and industrial base ) , and ww2-era occupation of your country ended 25 years ago with its lingering results still directly influenced your daily life , you would also be obsessed with ww2 . 
  actually , i 'd say poles on reddit care about ww2 * less * than average . 
   so you just take data from 1926 census compare it to 1939 there 's no need for such roundabout methods , as in this particular case you can find the entire list of at lest 111,091 poles executed by nkvd on nkvd order no . 
   it does n't mean that soviet army/government ordered to execute them . 
   and later on when they needed propaganda they ` discovered ' them 2 years later , and , as international red cross examination proven , they all happened to be buried at least three years before 1943 . 
   soviet union was n't ally , because there was no alliance . 
  oh , so soviet union seemed incredibly eager to cooperate with their totally-not-allies then . 
   from the documents it is estimated that there have been 80-100 thousands osadniks , sadly , osadniks were only a small minority out of over a million poles who were deported to siberia . 
  most of deported poles , including a chunk of my family , were regular people whose ancestors lived on those lands for centuries . 
   this is a guess . 
  well , your posts seem to be composed mainly of such `` guesses '' , as you hardly seem to have any actual knowledge on matters you are futily trying to defend . 
   i think that it was n't the worst possible scenario for those people . 
  yeah , fortunately soviets abandoned the `` total extermination '' approach after germans attacked them . 
  still , if in 1939-41 period i had to chose between being a pole in german-occupied poland , and being a pole in a soviet-occupied poland valuing my life i would pick the german occupation zone anytime . 
   that number is invented by anti-communist dissidents . 
  yes , and the poles which had the misfortune of remaining on the soviet side of the border after the riga treaty simply vanished into thin air one day . 
   in katyn , or more precisely in koziy gori - the german occupational forces ` suddenly ' discovered piles of bodies 2 years after they took smolensk and coincidentally , those bodies were identified as belonging to missing since 1939 polish officers taken pow after the soviet invasion of poland . 
  i wonder what on earth could possibly happen to them !, 
   later polish government using economical and other pressure i always knew shitty russia is no match to the omnipotent might of the polish government . 
  if we only realized it sooner , we could have used our unparalleled economical-and-other-presure capabilities to make russians fuck off from our country and return all the things they have stolen during their multiple pillages . 
   were given to nazi germany under their listed request , i 'm glad you at least admit that soviets were the most faithful ally of nazi germany before 1941 , small steps , i 'm positively surprised . 
   ( 1920 invasion and posterior concentration camps for soviet soldiers ) , interestingly enough , during the 1919-21 war more polish pows died in the soviet concentration camps , than the other way around . 
   the rest are so called ` deported ' , because prison or camps was not the only punishment under those trials yeah , that six year old kids surely committed many serious crimes against the soviet union , like being polish . 
   ( 200-300 thousands ) precisely , 200-300 thousands would approximately amount to a single wave of soviet deportations . 
  unfortunately , [ there were four of them . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_%281939%e2%80%9346%29#mass_deportations_to_the_east ), 
  as opposed to dividing every number by 100-500 in russian historiography ? 
  over million poles deported in 1940-41 is a number confirmed by multiple sources , and so is over 110,000 murdered during the polish operation in 1937-38 or 22,000 in katy\u0144 / chark\u00f3w / miednoje . 
  well , you kinda succeeded with the `` enslaving '' part ( 45 years of communist horror prepared by quislings backed by your occupational forces , disgusting ) , and as for the `` annihilating '' part - about million of poles deported to siberia and kazakhstan from their homes in soviet-annexed poland , or several hundred thousand poles murdered on various occasions like polish operation of nkvd or katy\u0144 massacre kinda experienced it , though fortunately for us you gave up on completely eradicating the polish nation after 1941 . 
   that 's the point . 
  obviously poland also had claims to those lands . 
  as we did in 1939  and that 's cool , but do n't expect us to perceive you any better than nazi germany then , 
   by the line of succession russian dukes from rurik family had 100 better claim . 
  oh , had they ? 
  the local rurik dynasty for over a hundred years maintained friendly relations with poland and was very closely intermarried with piasts . 
  the last ruler of halych boleslaw-yuri ii was a cousin of the king of poland w\u0142adys\u0142aw i , and brother of mazovian piast dukes . 
  in fact , he already was of a piast dynasty , rather than rurikid one . 
  after he was murdered by ruthenian boyars , his direct successors were his mazovian brothers , who already passed it to the king kazimierz iii . 
  however you look at that , that 's a way closer and better claim than some distant branch of rurik dynasty in another country . 
  inheritance of galicia was a clean and legit example of medieval international politics . 
   then union with litwa  well we did n't carve russia from 1316 to 1386 . 
  the territory conquered by pagan , unaffiliated with poland , lithuanians by 1385 already fully encompassed the territory of the commonwealth between 1667 and 1772 . 
   then multiple invasions to the east from when jagailo became polish king in 1386 . 
  and multiple muscovian invasions from the east . 
   because you have been submerged in polish historian paradigm , in which polska is jesus christ of europe , who just suffered from bully russia all of it 's history . 
  well , when you look at history from our perspective the thing you 'll regret the most is that we have never tried to preemptively destroy russia completely , which resulted in the unprecedented suffering we have received from that barbarians in the last 400 years . 
   also we are nation of conquerors and warriors , we do n't lie ourselves about that . 
  is just we ( and me personally ) do n't like that whining about poland in 1920 having some ` historical ' right to take disputed lands from russians/ukrainians ... while at the same time arguing that russia had some `` historical '' right to take `` disputed '' lands from poles/lithuanians in 1772 . 
  belarusians and ukrainians are * not * russians . 
  and if it was right for russia to claim their land from poland , then so was right for poland had to claim their lands from russia . 
  russians used their shitty claims to fuel their imperialism at the end of 18th century , and poles used their similarly shitty claims at the beginning of 20th century . 
   polish kings had no claim to galicia , except for this all `` succession line '' thingy . 
  it 's just like saying that austrian kings had no claim to czech and hungarian kingdoms in 1526 . 
   and polish invasion on russia begun already in 1013 and continued at all times until 17th century . 
  be it as polish kingdom or polish lithuanian union . 
  it must have been the most sneaky and clever `` invasion '' in history of the world then , considering that * all * the conquests in this supposed `` invasion '' were done by a completely unaffiliated third party which at the time had absolutely no ties with poland . 
  only now i can truly appreciate the unprecedented strategical genius of the king boles\u0142aw i. 
   it doesnt matter , it the same level of absurd argument . 
  `` poland never carved russia , because we do not recognize medieval russia and russia that in posterity carved out poland as same state . '', 
  no , you are completely mixing two distinct issues . 
  the argument is that poland never carved russia , because the all the statelets which remained from post-mongol-conquest-rus * were n't * even conquered by poland in the first place . 
  whether those statelets deserve the name `` russia '' is another issue , though i respect your right to see it that way even if i personally find it really silly . 
   if you can deny the continuity of russian state from 860 's to 1917 you also ca n't deny that ( excluding wars during the 17th century ) poland itself never `` carved '' any russian , ruthenian , rusyn ( or whichever name you prefer ) territory . 
  and eastern slavs living in the commonwealth were * not * russians , and that situation have n't changed despite widespread efforts of tsarist russia in 19th century trying to convince them otherwise . 
   because it 's was not the same poland , it was called polish-lithuanian unia . 
  it was simply called `` rzeczpospolita polska '' since 1791 , and the federal type of government was abolished , so bad shot . 
   they just killed all the successors and usurped the throne . 
  by all medieval laws of succession galicia-volyn should have gone to ryrik family in vladimir .
