  well , that 's probably what the galician nobles were counting on when they murdered their local rurik ruler . 
  the local dynasty intermarried with piasts in earlier generations , and thanks to that then-king of poland was higher in succession line than a more distant branch of rurik dynasty in another duchy . 
  as you have n't mentioned my * actual * point at all - that * the polish state itself did not carve `` russia '' at any point * - i 'll assume the impossible happened and my time wasted on arguing with russians on the internet finally paid off by them realizing they were wrong all this time . 
  oh , most of germans there were prussian/imperial soldiers . 
  we are indeed terribly sorry for not letting them stay after 1918 . 
  no , the polish state * itself * did not carve `` russia '' at any point . 
  well , * russia * itself was created in 1500s by one of the remaining provincional golden horde tributaries , so it would be rather hard for them to become conquered by anyone before they even existed . 
  if by `` russia '' you mean the east slavic principalities that resulted from the mongol conquest of kievan rus ( which is as much of a stretch as calling the roman empire ancient version of romania ) - then yes , one by one they were conquered by lithuania ... when lithuania was still pagan and had * absolutely * nothing to do with poland . 
  duchy of ruthenia , which probably also falls under your megalomaniac definition of `` russia '' was inherited by poland due to simple medieval succession laws ( after the plan of local nobles to kill their ruler backfired on them ) . 
  i also wonder , why wo n't you go to ukraine and belarus and tell them that their whole existence is a lie and they are totally `` russia '' , just do n't realize it ? 
   later returned . 
  yeah , the very descendants of them most likely !, 
  it 's not like eastern germanic tribes which used to lived there migrated to north africa and iberian peninsula where they slowly died off/mixed with locals , or anything . 
   the justification of such crimes are getting upvoted . 
  * justification ? 
  * after what germans did to europe in 1939-45 period you should consider yourself lucky that was all you got off with . 
  that was the cause and justification of what happened to eastern germans , though i love these autistic posts of / u/silvester _ and / u/pwnzerfaust every now and then , it 's like attempted murderer complaining about his would-be victim shooting him in a leg . 
  the level of `` living in an alternate reality '' present in posts from both those users is so high , you consider it almost cute . 
  anyhow , my post was simply correction of this `` thousand years '' mistake . 
  and considering that thousand years before 1945 , west slavs were still living around berlin , it would be rather hard for germans to already live in \u015al\u0105sk or pomorze back then . 
  that was n't a * justification * , as for that any history book covering the first half of the 40s would suffice . 
   posen pozna\u0144 and entirety of wielkopolska was always majority polish , even during the darkest period of germanization at the end of 19th century . 
   and those exact land were taken around 350 years before that from russia by poland and lithuania . 
  nah , unfortunately for you 1772-1795 is where the train stops . 
  the pre-partition poland * never * took any lands from * russia * ( alright , we did * take * some in 1618 ... but you have reconquered * all * of them by 1667 , and already took some more on top of that ) . 
  you should probably ask the guy one post above . 
   he did n't need to justify the annexation of eastern poland as you invaded the soviet union about 17 years before world war two started and annexed it for yourself . 
  just like the russian empire invaded us about 110 years before the world war one started and annexed those exact same lands for itself . 
  we can go back and forth like that , if that counts as an argument now . 
  also , a significant part of the land annexed by soviet union in 1939 * never * had anything to do with neither russia nor soviet union . 
  i 'm not trying to deny anything . 
  [ in fact that 's the exact thing * you * are doing by calling eastern galicia `` ukrainian land '' ] ( http://s2.postimg.org/ipxr167qh/polish_1931.png ) in pre-ww2 context . 
  [ counties with polish plurality in pre-ww2 eastern poland . 
   it helps that the ukrainian land t yeah , the fact that millions of poles from that `` ukrainian land '' were resettled to the former german territories probably also helped . 
   preu\u00dfen was german for nearly a thousand years . 
  same goes for pommern . 
  thousand years ? 
  maybe according to some nazi propaganda . 
  there was 700 years from the very start of the german population replacement in prussia to the end of ww2 , pomerania was german for even less . 
  silesia became majority german as late as in 18th century . 
   the bern of the east . 
  it 's more to the west than vienna . 
  considering that before the ww2 poland used to be close to france , uk and italy in population and far ahead of spain i 'd say it * definitely * changed in a significant way . 
  did n't you ? 
  well , that 's kinda the topic this very discussion started from . 
  if we only * actually * tried to destroy the russian state back then ... instead of merely reluctantly conducting a half-assed intervention in support of polish nobles because their private meddling was n't going as neatly as they expected . 
  unfortunately for us - no , we sadly * have n't * managed to '' * conquer * a foreign country , and ( brutally ) occupy it for * many years * '' . 
  that 's exactly the part where we failed , form the foresight of following 400 years of constant russian attempts on invasions and occupations of poland ( a fair share of which succeeded ) . 
  that was the last chance to prevent it , and we wasted it completely . 
   how do you feel about balkanites moving into your city ? 
  i do n't think there is any widespread sentiment about migrants from europe . 
  while i have n't met many balkanites , we have a lot of ukrainian immigrants in warsaw and they get along fine . 
   they say you have the same last names ending with `` ski '' . 
  yeah , that 's the most common surname ending around here . 
   also it seems to be better off/richer compared to slavic countries . 
  we are quite good , as far as countries that experienced soviet occupation go , though czechia , slovenia and slovakia are all a bit richer than us on per capita basis . 
  we have a way bigger economy overall than either of them though . 
   do you have festivals like the oktoberfest/exit type where you can meet polish people and have fun ? 
  sure , there are many big festivals in poland - in fact one of the biggest annual ones , [ przystanek woodstock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woodstock_festival_%28poland%29 ) just ended . 
  the 1794 one ? 
  no , it was one of the many russian invasions of poland which ended with our country losing independence for the first time . 
  the 1864 one ? 
  it definitely was a separatist revolt , sure . 
  equally as much as polish anti-nazi resistance during the ww2 was a `` separatist revolt '' , that is . 
  i mean , did you * really * expect that you 'll conquer a foreign country , brutally occupy it for many years , and * not * experience any `` separatist revolts '' ? 
  of course there were . 
  like the 1864 post-january uprising [ mass executions and deportations to siberia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising#evolution_of_events ) it was like a prototype or stalinism . 
  [ or perhaps this 1794 version of warsaw uprising , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_praga#massacre ) this time with russian invaders razing the right bank of warsaw and brutally murdering dozens of thousands of polish civilians . 
  russian empire was always the exact same barbaric invader soviet union was . 
  analogical crimes to which one ? 
  it 's not like tsarist russia was any better than bolsheviks - on top of destroying our country twice ( in 1795 and 1815/31 ) , they have also brutally occupied us for a century , just like bolsheviks did for 45 years . 
  and from the polish perspective , soviet union was simply a russian empire 2.0 ( this time with a red flag ) . 
   you destroyed muscowy sadly we did n't , which turned out to be a royal pain in the ass 200 years later and ever since then . 
  i 've been seeing some black guys in metro several times a month lately , we truly are a cosmopolitan city now :d, 
  well , warsaw is 50-60 years old and is mostly crappy commieblocks with some more-or-less faithful mock-ups of famous historical buildings destroyed by germans here and there . 
  despite outside appearances it * is * a great city , though definitely way less `` touristy '' , when compared to krak\u00f3w with its medieval capital part . 
   szczecin why on earth would you even consider coming to this forgotten city in the middle of nowhere ? 
  neither was i , but it was a fun discussion nevertheless . 
   not that much really . 
  oh nono , if another baltic tribe living somewhere 800 years ago , or perhaps 0,1 % of lithuanians in suwa\u0142ki already counts as `` lithuanian minority '' warranting bullshit claims , then ~ 60 % poles around wilno surely would make the return of this region to poland after 70 years of * foreign * control an epitome of historical justice ? 
   for a bullshit war they * forced * you into . 
  nah , we * really * wanted to go into that one at first , for several reasons : 1 ) making ties with usa even closer 2 ) gaining some real combat experience 3 ) hope for some new economical contracts in the middle east, 
   alright , next time you 're defeated , again , by invaders , we 'll be sure to sacrifice our lives for you again . 
  well , we kinda completely stopped counting on france after the last time alliance with you was proven worthless . 
  we also have a bit more reliable ally called `` usa '' now . 
  how is 60 % * not * majority ? 
  and there 's even a 75 % county on the border with belarus . 
   so you expected france to attack germany and the ussr ? 
  yes , i expected france to attack germany around september 14 . 
  that 's exactly the message french government was sending to poland since polish-german relations started to deteriorate . 
  ussr was n't explicitly mentioned in our alliance treaty , thus i did not , but i see an unlikely possibility that had france actually followed on their alliance promises , the soviet attack would n't happen . 
  after all , stalin ** did ** wait for * over two weeks * with his invasion of poland , even though hitler expected that soviet attack will be simultaneous with the german one . 
   sorry we were n't always around to save you from constantly being attacked by your neighbors . 
  you have n't saved us even once . 
  the french-controlled polish puppet state during napoleon would kinda count , though the french main goal in this particular case was european hegemony , and poles beaten by france 's enemies 10 years earlier were your natural , convenient and faithful to the very end allies . 
   that does n't fucking mean you can insult every french person of pussies like you did . 
  i did n't insult every french person . 
  i simply wrote that '' [ the nation of france ] lost the second one after acting like complete pussies and not doing anything you have promised in an alliance treaty ( 1939 ) . '', 
  which is a factually correct , albeit harshly worded description of actions of the country called the third french republic in the early phase of the world war 2 .
