  `` the content on this subreddit is literally being censored in an unsightly manner but let 's discuss about this few guys who * might * be brigading instead '' . 
  i also kept wondering whether you really are this stupid . 
   it 's not universal at all . 
   0 points ( 31 % upvoted ) nothing to see here , clearly everyone but those `` brigadeers from le stormfront '' totally consider this to be the best thing ever . 
   notice how the other threads have hundreds of comments and nobody is complaining . 
  it still looked temporary back then , and with the third instance of such thread it starts to look as it 's unfortunately going to remain here for longer . 
   alternatively you can keep getting jerked off by racist subreddits and complain about le censorship . 
  this * is * censorship - it 's literally trying to confine the broad topic which happen to be disliked by mods to a badly visible and unusable thread . 
  if not - why do n't simply make a one big '' / r/europe m\u00e9gathread\u00e9 '' , updated daily !, 
  imagine how * neat * frontpage would look like then . 
  i doubt there ever was anything so universally disliked by the community of / r/europe regarding moderation in here , as these terrible megathreads . 
  what a shitty ersatz of an actual content !, 
  ... so you think that nobody would notice if it happened * twice * ? 
  our spelling is the best thing ever because we invented it ourselves in the middle ages and you can easily read anything written in polish ever since . 
  no silly foreign ha\u010deks !, 
  nah , imperative of `` sra\u0107 '' is definitely `` sraj '' . 
  though it once again prove that czech and slovak are hillarious . 
  `` german '', 
  because `` syr '' sounds * really * hillbillyish to my polish ear . 
  if * imvading and annexing a part of another sovereign nation * ( while being a party of a treaty protecting its territorial integrity ) does * not * qualify for sanctions , i do n't know what would . 
   like you did to usa five times before ? 
  well , the last time usa annexed a territory of another nation after invading it was in 1846 ( mexico ) . 
  on the hand , russia did so * last year * . 
  they are hurting our economy much more than yours , but we are still the most vocal supporters of them * because that 's the right thing to do * . 
   romanians would have been at the outskirt of hungary bad for them i guess . 
  in the end , the fact that some of them would live near border would be irrelevant to the essence - you either have one million of hungarians living in romania , or at least one million romanians living in hungary . 
  i fail to see why romanians should be given preferential treatment - in fact , given the relative size of both nations , hungarians are significantly more harmed by the outcome disadvantegous to them . 
   that 's just a dozen of villages that 's still a dozen villages * too much * - especially in a situation when you are drawing from scratch an entirely new , and supposedly `` ethnically fair '' border . 
  the * end result * is exactly the same - both in current borders and in 1940 ones you have approximately a million of romanians/hungarians living in the middle of another country . 
  i wo n't even mention the hungarian-majority areas on the * current * hungarian-romanian border , which are what i actually consider the worst part about trianon . 
  no , in * current * borders ( which leave 1/3 of hungarian population outside hungary ) it certainly does n't . 
  in , say , 1940-47 ones though ? 
  the exact same situation as nowadays , just reversed . 
  [ for reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/hungary_1941_ethnic.svg/2000px-hungary_1941_ethnic.svg.png ), 
   i have n't seen any slovaks or romanians crying about the past though . 
  well , that 's because they won . 
  so what 's exactly the difference between romania with a hungarian area in the middle , and hungary with a romanian area in the middle ? 
   does n't he have a license for medical use ? 
  i wonder whether you are aware of the obscure fact that us laws are effective only on the territory of the united states . 
  frankly , i much prefer the current us hegemony to the `` emerging economies hegemony '' it would result in . 
   poland will join before 2020 lol . 
  there are so many factors which will contribute to the fact that we wo n't that i 'll only mention the most important ones . 
  first and most importantly , the eurosceptic right-wing party will win the elections in autumn , thus ruling at least until 2019 . 
  even the still-ruling euroenthusiastic centre-right party is against joining eurozone right now . 
  not to even mention that over 70 % of population is against it , so i do n't see our political class eager to commit a political suicide anytime soon - especially considering that we would have to change our constitution to adapt euro first , and for that you need a 2/3 majority in the parliament . 
  the fact that we remained with our own currency with a floating exchange rate is also to thank for our * relatively * good economical performance in recent years . 
  we would have to peg pln to euro for at least 2 years to join eurozone first , and there is approximately * zero * chance of such thing happening in a foreseeable future . 
  in conclusion , i 'd say poland joining before 2020 is about as likely as sweden or even uk joining before 2020 . 
  i doubt we 'll join eurozone before ~ 2040-50 , if ever . 
  right , hungary was still an independent kingdom when this map was created . 
   so , if a popular british magazine depicted polish people as uneducated filth and disguised it as `` satirical artwork '' , you 'd be ok with it ? 
  yes , i 'd be ok with it . 
  you should be able to print in your own newspaper whatever opinions you like , and the people are completely free to not buy your newspaper and not read them if they do n't like them . 
   but mocking them for their appearance is not one . 
  i fail to see this `` mocking them for their appearance '' at all here . 
  it 's a completely regular art style of `` angora '' frontpages . 
  ^ ( edit - spelling ), 
  but that 's precisely what i 'm taking about . 
  you percieve this picture through taking out this `` blackface '' concept which exists in your own culture , and then trying to put it in a completely alien environment where it never existed . 
  it 's absurdal . 
  we neither used black people as slaves on our plantations , nor we occupied and exploited the african countries in the past . 
  it 's only natural we wo n't experience the `` white guilt '' phenomenon in a way americans or brits do . 
  because why bother with a safe , stable and only kinda well-off country , when you can equally as easily get to a * really * rich one , and similarly safe and stable . 
  he asked about them being `` enemy number one '' , not `` the largest immigrant group '' . 
  well , jokes ( however bad they would n't be ) do n't tend to be punishable by law around here . 
  freedom of speech ? 
  such alien concept must indeed come off as a shock to a brit . 
  so how many romanian refugees are wanting to flee the war right now again ? 
  living in warsaw can skew your perception a bit in that regard . 
  that would be the whole island , not only the republic of ireland, 
  and , as i outlined two posts ago , it turns out that you * can * treat things like the thing they will become , and in fact it 's a standard practice in many cases . 
  the very basis of your only argument is inherently false . 
   no mind , no humanity . 
  certainity of inevitable ( if not interrupted ) development of it in a short timeframe is more than enough for me , and it * does * change the point , just like i outlined in my previous post . 
   do you eat green tomatoes ? 
  do you treat them as full grown tomatoes ? 
  no , but if you destroyed my plantation of still-green-tomatoes , i would except getting a compensation in a worth of fully-grown-tomatoes they would inevitably become . 
  suing you for profits i would get if you have n't demolished my still-under-construction-shopping-center would arguably be a bit more tricky . 
   will be retired one day , that does not mean i can get my pension fund today . 
  yet your right to get your pension when you will retire is still continuously protected . 
   you do not treat things as what they will becomes . 
  of course you do an it often happens . 
  though perhaps destroying crops or demolishing buildings under construction belonging to the other people is also perfectly alright in your book , whatever suits you . 
   if you are braindead you do not recover . 
  and if you are a fetus , you * will * eventually develop a conscious mind . 
  thus , comparing both situations in a way you did is a logical fallacy . 
   often pull the plug on them since we know they are gone , just the body is there . 
  yes , it 's would be just like pulling the plug on them ... while it is almost certain that in few weeks time they 'll start to recover . 
  and no , i doubt anyone would allow for such a thing . 
   that we should abort all babies and that this way , we would decrease public spending !, 
  that 's * precisely * what one could infer from your reasoning though . 
   if they did n't do that people like you would cry about it in 30 years . 
  we will cry about it in 35 years anyway , after zus will go bankrupt . 
   poland was orthodox once ... 
  equally as much as romania was islamic . 
  but then again , it wo n't be any harm either . 
   that was never intended . 
  if not why there was no autonomy for already ukrainian and belarussian parts of the country after 1920 ? 
  there * was * partial autonomy , although it sadly was badly implemented for most parts .
