  your post is full of misconceptions and half-truths . 
  * vilnius used to be the capital of grand duchy of lithuania , a multi-national old ruthenian and polish speaking country before the partitions * by the beginning of 20th century it 's ethnic composition was mostly polish with large jewish minority , and little to no lithuanians . 
  in a period between 1918 and 1921 it has changed hands between germans , poles , bolheviks , poles , bolsheviks , lithuanians and poles again . 
  so much for the alleged `` polish occupation '' . 
  * now there are polish people who remember how it used to be a polish city and are sad for how lithuanians are falsyfying history in a way you just did in your post . 
  nobody says it should belong to poland anymore though , it 's a fucking capital of lithuania today and poles are only a 20 % minority there nowadays . 
  that was lech pozna\u0144 though ... 
  it 's as if you posted a banner of fc barcelona fans and called it display of madridistas . 
  [ see my post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k6q2d/dear_polish_football_fans_are_you_serious_we_want/clig5cj ) , basically ukrainians and lithuanians panicking over not pretending together with them that history has began in 1945 . 
  oh , this thread again ? 
  as i said in a previous one , it 's a polish flag with the ** pre-war ** polish coat of arms and ** pre-war ** coats of arms of cities of wilno and lw\u00f3w ( yes , they used to be called like that , my ukrainian and lithuanian friends ) . 
  there is nothing revisionist about this banner , it 's about rememberance ( and this particular matter is something comparably traumatic to poles as trianon treaty is to hungarians ) . 
  though i agree , reminding you that some of your most important cities used to be polish is bound to strain relations and not the best thing to do during a football match . 
  ^ ( edit : aww , seems i got from +6 to -13 in few hours , surely it feels like an achievement . 
  wish we still had ( ? | ? 
  ) ^ ) ^ ( in res . ), 
  considering you are a pole and it 's hard to have a normal discussion with you , you match very neatly to your own description, 
  glad you admit you have lost this discussion then . 
  ah yeah , as opposed to lithuanian imperialists . 
  `` they may speak polish and have polish culture , but some of their descendants 500 years ago * were * lithuanian so they are just polonized lithuanians . 
  americans are probably `` anglicized germans '' for you too . 
  and yes , they called themselves lithuanian , in the same way people call themselves `` masovian '' or `` silesian '' . 
  most of them wanted nothing to do with your petty nation state , using a foreign baltic language , aggresive towards poles and stealing the history of the grand duchy ignoring the fact that it was predominantly old ruthenian and polish speaking country since 14-15th century . 
  what really happened in 1920 was that : 1 . 
  poles were controlling wilno and did so since the withdrawal of germans at the end of 1918 save the lit-bel soviet republic episode . 
  soviets took the city over in their july offensive of 1920 . 
  soviets have `` given '' the city they just conquered to lithuania knowing it would damage relations between our countries . 
  in august soviets were defeated by warsaw and throughout the next month we managed to regain most of territory we held in 1919 - wilno occupied by lithuania being a notable exception . 
  to regain wilno and polish ethnic area around it occupied by lithuania one month before , we have used the ruse with \u017beligowski . 
  not our most honorable moment , i 'll admit , but it was n't something completely out of blue like your lithuanian education could lead you to believe . 
  we never wanted conflict and open confrontation with lithuanians . 
  so yes , there were at least three occupations of wilno/vilna/vilnius in 1920 , all between june and october : 1 . 
  bolshevik one ( from poland ) 2 . 
  lithuanian one ( from soviets ) 3 . 
  polish ( \u017beligowski 's ) one ( from lithuania ) lithuanian propaganda always conveniently mentioned only the last one . 
  yeah , you pass some unnecessary law which wo n't change anything instead of actually doing something with the problem . 
  though after all the years with this government i feel like i should be used to it by now , as it 's their typical course of action . 
  and you can still buy it in a shop 20m from school or bring it from home . 
  i would if i was a kid . 
  all aside , brilliant move from stalin . 
  we ca n't even bitch about territories of poland annexed by ussr during ww2 without some cunt mentioning thet we were given some german lands by soviets as a war compensation . 
   any source on 3 % of lithuanians in vilnius then ? 
  every single census done there , be it by russians ( 1897 ) , germans ( 1916 ) or poles ( 1931 ) until the lithuanian occupation of 1939 ? 
  and actually the 3 % is an overstatement , the highest lithuanians reached in any of them was 2 % . 
   it was lithuanian to begin with though . 
  and new york was dutch . 
  and istanbul was greek . 
  it had ** 2 % ** of lithuanian population in 1920s . 
  compared to 50 % of poles and 40 % of jews , most of them also speaking polish . 
  it was the third most important centre of polish culture during the 19th century occupation , right after warsaw and lw\u00f3w . 
  lithuania claiming it in 1918 as their capital based on old gdl claim was as if france has claimed aachen for their new capital basing it on the fact that it was charlemagne 's capital and ignoring that population there is german . 
  either way , it 's not important anymore as lithuanians have succesfuly colonised the city and many poles emigrated , and now there is only about 20 % of poles there . 
  while autonomy for polish minority in lithuania in areas occupied by it in 1939 would be appreciated , i would never want those lands to become part of poland again , as they are not worth all the hassle . 
  ^ ( although i 'm sad for your lack of reply , i 'm glad you have at least read my post , as indicated by your downvote . ), 
  ah , the famous lithuanian-poland commonwealth , matched only by the united kingdom of ireland and great britain , slovakoczechia and hungary-austria . 
   and is lithuanian today it is * today * , and nobody , including people flying that banner , denies it . 
  mind the pre-war coat of arms of poland there . 
  but to say it was constantly lithuanian is falsyfying history . 
  we all do . 
  commemorating the two very important old polish cities which do n't exist anymore is bad , m ` kay ? 
  yeah , we know . 
  and it 's spelled lw\u00f3w . 
  the pogo\u0144 lw\u00f3w football club was reactivated few years ago in ukraine and i recall it got some traction in poland . 
  though i do n't think this one is connected with that , it 's just legia ultras being legia ultras . 
  it 's not really that offensive considering their usual form . 
  the banner shows pre-war coats of arms of wilno and lw\u00f3w , along with the pre-1927 coat of arms of the 2nd polish republic . 
  polish goup in ukraine : - ddd we empire nao : - dd be afraid, 
  agreed to do it ** someday ** once certain economic markers are reached . 
  nowhere it 's said we have to do immediately , else sweden would be in eurozone since 2002 as they , unlike uk or denmark , and like us do n't have a formal opt-out . 
   meanwhile the eu is giving poland money to help reach those goals . 
  i wonder why they are giving any money to luxembourg , lithuania , estonia , greece , latvia , portugal , slovenia , belgium , slovakia , malta and spain then , as all these countries seem to already be in eurozone while still receiving funds from eu . 
   do you not see that as even remotely dick-ish ? 
   i mean just disregard any national loyalties for a second here , imagine any other country was doing this - one that you 're paying for , for example . 
  wonder what sweden , denmark and uk have to say about it . 
  because that is my opinion as well . 
   when i was there all they wanted from me was money the enlightened rich white uberman has decided to grace our unworthy bongo bongo land with his presence , and the native savages , vile creatures , wanted only his money from him :( (, 
  it 's very relevant to the argument , as you seem imply that we are somehow obliged to do everything we are told , because our economy is much bigger than the economy of other net recipients . 
  we are joining eurozone right after sweden , because that is in * our * best interests ( even if not in eurozone 's ) and what are you going to do about it ? 
  oh , it 's this bullshit and condescending `` eu is giving polan trillions of free monies and it 's the only reason poland seems succesful '' talk again . 
  even greece and portugal receive ** more ** per capita than us - and they 've been getting it for the last 30 or so years . 
  so do baltic states and hungary . 
  of course we get more money in absolute numbers than latvia or bulgaria - because we are much bigger than them . 
  ca n't hear you over the sound of our awesome banknotes with portraits of polish kings , and all the benefits of floating exchange rate . 
  we are also emigrating to the countries that use pound , krone or franc . 
  avoiding countries using euro would seriously fuck up our world colonization plans . 
  well , for one the pro-euro adoption parties would have to get over 2/3 of votes in parliament to change constitution . 
  no chance of anything even remotely close to that happening anytime soon . 
  if they really were spineless , we would already be in eurozone . 
  danzig was a free city and already more under control of poland than germany in 1930 so it would n't be * that * unreasonable idea . 
  you are right about wilno though , only hardcore lithuanian nationalists would predict what would happen to this city in the future . 
  so they did cut it , as they have not delivered the additional ammount we have ordered . 
  is n't `` russia '' just a peripheral part of the old kievan rus , the one never conquered by lithuania from the golden horde ? 
  i found it much more anti-russian than pro-ukrainian . 
  yeah , i find it interesting too that the attitute of our compatriots towards ukraine seems much warmer on reddit than anywhere else . 
  though it might be just the context we are discussing ukrainian matters here . 
  personally , i do n't think i will ever bring myself to * liking * ukraine , but i still fully support them in their struggle to become free of venomous russian influence and fully a part of europe and find really sad all the misery brought upon them during the last year . 
   lviv is not `` entirely different '' from lw\u00f3w actually i completely agree with your post and i see we are of the same opinion of both the current condition of the city and if should it ever change hands again . 
  yes - you are right and you are not right at the same time . 
  to make an analogy - there are many old byzantine buildings in istanbul , but that does n't mean constantinople still exists . 
  what i wanted to convey in my two posts , is that what made lw\u00f3w so important for poland were n't those old polish monuments and landmarks .
