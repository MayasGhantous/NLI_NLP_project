  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volhynia_experiment )  while in soviet union those were soviet republics with their own governments ? 
  yeah , the generalgouvernment in german-ocupied poland also had `` its own government '' . 
  could you remind me how many ukrainians died in an artifical famine caused by soviet policies - holodomor ? 
  i 'm sure they were thrilled that at least it all happened under `` their own government '' . 
   small areas , except wilno , in which case it was condition of lithuanian integration to the soviet union . 
  `` let 's conquer this ethnically polish area . 
  we will then give it to another country ( we plan to conquer next year anyway ) so nothing to see here . '', 
   so we burn it , then we rebuild it and it ours ? 
  cool . 
  lithuanians were stil pagans back then , and were not polish allies until 30 years later . 
   while poland while taking what never was theirs = not aggressor . 
  if russia-muscovy conquering lands that 400-500 years earlier belonged to * other * east slavic duchies conquered by golden horde , then by lithuania and ultimately inherited by poland counts as `` retaking what is ours '' , then conquering lands that 120 years earlier were integral parts of the commonwealth definitely surely also qualifies this way . 
  oh , i forgot about the special russian perk , my bad . 
   kill the rurikovich local dynasty , occupy land , funnily enough , the last duke from the rurikovich local dynasty was killed by his own nobles , after he seeked cooperation with the kingdom of poland . 
  he died childless , and the king of poland was his direct heir . 
  while the local nobles who killed the duke in the first place probably had a different succession plans , the polish army secured the lawful succession . 
  completely regular medieval politics . 
   in any case do n't compare russian-polish border wars considering that those `` russian-polish border wars '' ended up with poland completely ceasing to exist for over a century , and russia brutally occupying the core part of our country including our capital for all that time , i would n't consider it to be the most faithful name . 
   what a salad must be in someone 's brain to say that there were slaves in soviet union . 
  yeah , those millions of innocent gulag prisoners worked to death in siberian taiga were clearly on vaccation there . 
   indeed you were . 
  pilsudski troops even took kiev and minsk and were n't meant to stop there . 
  and he did it while fighting alongside belarusian and ukrainian allies . 
  ( soviet ) russia does not have a monopoly to be a sole ally of those nations , despite what your internal propaganda could lead you to believe . 
  of course , after you have almost conquered our country again a few months later , and then we somehow managed to push you back we have unfortunately settled for a limited-victory peace treaty , thus betraying our ukrainian allies . 
  that 's indeed a dark card in our history , but sadly after summer 1920 i doubt we could beat soviet russia decisively enough to secure both ukrainian and belarusian independence . 
   you can even overlap modern borders of ukraine and belarus and see that those are the same of the 1939 ` invasion ' which in fact was retaking land populated by ukrainians , russians and belarussians . 
  you can also notice that the 1939 borders included significant areas which had a marginal population of ukrainians , russians and belarusians , most notably wilno , \u0141om\u017ca and bia\u0142ystok areas . 
   warsaw , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a or lublin were not disputed by soviet union . 
  yeah , though i wonder how could they possibly until that point experienced about 100 years of russian rule , from which they were liberated only by the armies of the central powers a few years earlier . 
  a great mystery indeed , though it definitely does not include any russian invasion at any point . 
   actually lvov was founded by russian/ukrainian prince daniel of galicia . 
  the town itself had important polish majority , but all the villages around it were ukrainian . 
  it was also completely burned down by a lithuanian raid in 1356 , and then rebuilt from scractch as a polish city . 
   the border never was stable . 
  is just in 1667 poland reached it maximum of russian lands conquered and after this point you just shrank . 
  we reached our maximum in * 1618 * . 
  in 1654-67 war you were already the agressor , and in 1667 peace treaty you have reconquered everything poland ever took from russia/muscovy , and a significant part of lands inherited by poland from lithuania which never belonged to russia/muscovy ( even if they were conquered by * lithuania * from * ruthenian golden horde tributaries * 400 years earlier ) . 
  considering that latter is indirect on * both * sides of the conflict , it 's stretching the idea of `` reconquest '' so much , that the polish 1920 kiev offensive could also easily qualify as such . 
   lvov was part of poland ( after you assassinated it 's heirs btw ) and stopped being in 1794 . 
  well , it would be hard for it to remain being a part of poland considering that thanks to intensive russian efforts ( with prussian and austrian cooperation ) poland kinda ceased to exist . 
  as soon as we regained statehood , lw\u00f3w again became a part of poland . 
   in any case it is disputed land , you can not call this invasion . 
  yes , you `` can not call it an invasion '' because it was a land * inherited * 600 years earlier from a * ruthenian * duchy . 
  on the other hand fighting a war of independence on lands that were a part of your country 100 years earlier before it got conquered is clearly an invasion . 
  apparently this is russia 's special perk - even the most bullshit of their claims remain valid for eternity , while the opposite is true for anyone fighting with russia . 
   edit : did you just rewrote all you original message ? 
  kind of . 
  i have a broken keyboard and it was sent before it was ready . 
  i initially tried to fix it ad-hoc , but the changes were big enough i decided to delete it and post it once more . 
  i wrote this one in notepad to avoid such problem again . 
   1919 polish newly reborn state was the aggressor of course we were the agressor !, 
  we even dared to take such `` historically russian '' cities like warsaw , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a or lublin !, 
  it 's hard not to be an `` agressor '' in an independence war . 
  and , of course , pressing 500 year claims ( and accidentally conquering a bunch of land which never had anything to do even with those weak claims ) is perfectly alright when you are russia , but when you are poland ... even figgting for your independence seems to be `` agression '' . 
  poor , poor russia . 
   1939 those territories were simply retaken . 
  yeah , especially the city of lw\u00f3w , which never had anything to do with russia before that point , or area of \u0141om\u017ca and bia\u0142ystok which was about 100 % ethnically polish . 
   the border was swifting to one side or another since 1300 's to 1794 , not 600 . 
  the border was completely stable ever since 1667 - after finishing your succesful invasion that year you even signed the `` eternal peace '' with us . 
  fast foward 100 years and you are completely eradicating our country in cooperation with prussia . 
  but no-no , you are * totally * not an agressor . 
   the 600 years talk is non-sense . 
  sure , it is . 
  for example the lw\u00f3w area was a part of poland since 1340 , and never had anything to do with any russias , ruses or ruthenias until ussr conquered it in 1939 . 
  the average might be a bit lower , about 400-500 years though . 
  i knew you would try such bullshit excuse , that 's why i have selected the wars which were primarily about destroying the existence of the polish state . 
  conquering lands lost 600 years earlier by a country whose connection to russia was loose at best was somewhere between a convenient * casus belli * and an added bonus in all of those cases . 
   curiously it was another way around , western europe invading russia at all historical points . 
  yeah , those [ 1792 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93russian_war_of_1792 ) , [ 1794 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ko%c5%9bciuszko_uprising ) , [ 1919 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) and [ 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) western invasions of russia ... oh , wait . 
   poland being attacked with or without us soldiers is ww3 whatever way you look at it . 
  i would n't bet on it . 
  russia attacked ukraine as recently as last year , and the only reaction was a collective shrug of shoulders . 
  now , if some allied soldiers would be the ones to die in an unlikely invasion of our country , that would make a much stronger safety guarantee than even a dozen of ( ultimately ) worthless treaties . 
   'd just rather not make ourselves a target by hosting missile sites before hand as i already said , we are not * making * ourselves a target , we already were a target all along . 
  russians have military bases and missiles targeting our cities stationed 300km from our capital . 
  that 's * precisely * why we are inviting americans here , not the other way around . 
   zero benefit , us army stationing in poland makes it more likely that they will deliver on their alliance promises . 
  after 1939 we are kinda touchy on this subject . 
   congratulations you became a target ? 
  we 've been a russian target since 1600s , so nothing changed . 
  at least we are a target * with american soldiers * on our soil , that 's better than being a target without them . 
  oh , sure , but fortunately for us all russia is not even close to the soviet union in terms of power and potential , and they do n't occupy and pillage half of europe anymore . 
  `` new cold war '' ? 
  with such diaproportion in power it would barely affect us . 
  the sooner russians realize they ca n't keep up with nato , the better , but until it happens i 'd take american bases here anytime just in case . 
  i also find the fact that you mentioned `` blowjob jokes '' incredibly ironic , because ( in context ) they referred * precisely * to the american prolonged inability to deliver on their missile shield bases in poland promise . 
  well , we are by far the biggest country in the region , so it only makes sense that most foreign companies planning to sell their stuff in this general area locate their factories and distribution centers in our country . 
  they already promised us the missile shield a decade ago . 
  glad they finally delivered on their promise . 
  at last . 
   us trying to neuter russia oh no , russia wo n't be able to threaten everyone so easily anymore :( the more russia is neutered , the better . 
  that does n't contradict my initial point . 
  yeah , our industry would simply go bankrupt then instead of being sold for pennies , because either way nobody would want to buy the outdated , overpriced , low quality crap produced by it . 
   exectly , you think ireland feels all warm from it ? 
  well , it turns out that * united kingdom * did the exact same thing about the lands where people indentyfying with their country lived , that you explicitly said they * would n't * . 
  interestingly enough , it even happened in the exact same time period the whole wilno conflict . 
  on your other points i agree with you . 
   the only reason they supported it to maintain less balance in our country . 
  it 's their strategy and it 's still going on ( e.g.
