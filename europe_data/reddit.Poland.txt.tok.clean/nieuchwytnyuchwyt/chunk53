  we are not federalists ' slaves . 
   you ca n't continuously take money and shout against the eu at the same fucking time . 
  of course i can . 
  i am perfectly allowed to like the unified market and open borders aspects of eu ( and free monies ) - nothing more , nothing less . 
  protecting your national sovereignity by giving it up ? 
  that 's like the most idiotic idea i have heard today . 
  yeah , there 's even more sure method to make russian * threat * disappear - all you have to do is to simply give up your sovereignity to * russians * . 
  we celebrate napoleon as well . 
  he is even mentioned in our national anthem in a positive light . 
  til napoleon is disliked in some european countries . 
  yes , and greece is 4x smaller than poland . 
  2 \u00d7 2 = 4 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 poland has 16 voivodships . 
  my math checks out :d, 
   they do n't want to tell . 
  if they do n't wa n't to tell , it should be their own fucking problem , not ours . 
  they could be petty criminals fleeing the justice system in their country for all we know . 
   there still a likelihood poland and romania might officially join the euro by 2020 ? 
  definitely not , we 'll be following sweden and czech republic in short to medium timeframe . 
  in a long run though ? 
  who knows , maybe by 2050 we might join the eurozone , though for that to happen it will definitely have to be a way different ez than the one existing nowadays . 
   they have to , as they promised that in their treaty of accession . 
  so has sweden , and they managed to avoid euro just fine until now . 
  even though in theory we have to join * at some point * , there is no way to * actually * force us to do so . 
   ignore the fact that our neighbour slovakia adopted $ without problems . 
  yes , but then again , the entire slovakian economy is comparable to the two average polish voivodships . 
   polish youth is very different from their parents , most of them do n't differ much in their opinions from their western counterparts . 
  this is funny , because the polish youth is noticeably more conservative than the baby boomers ( 30-40 year old ) generation . 
  note : those are the most common names for children born in 2014 , not in the general population . 
  we probably had them like 200 or 300 years ago . 
  the one big blob of `` polish '' would look weird , so they had to dig them up even though the are all long extinct . 
  it also came * from * the term balkans . 
   what the hell did hoover do for poland ? 
  sent a lot of humanitarian aid here after the ww1 . 
  though it was way before he became a president , sure . 
   baltic and slavic languages are related . 
  but they * are * related . 
  baltic languages are definitely the closest non-slavic languages to , say , polish - and they look way more ... similar than anything germanic , romance or celtic . 
  while both branches definitely diverged at least 3 thousands years ago , that 's still later than divergence with any other branch of indo-european languages . 
  yes , and adam ma\u0142ysz ski jumping hill in wis\u0142a . 
  probably some more , if you really looked for them - though they most likely all include the * imienia * - `` named after '' part . 
  by `` places '' i meant streets , roundabouts and squares , and naming conventions of those are just like i described . 
  of course you are , we have converted you in the first place after all , 
  catholic pilgrimage sites are included in the `` traces of polishness '' part . 
  there are many non-religious people praising jesus in the church during christmas . 
  it 's already a very common tourist destination in poland ( and the average trip focuses solely on looking for surviving traces of * polishness * , old wilno and famous poles who lived there ) . 
  guess it 's just like the german trips to wroc\u0142aw or szczecin . 
  we have numerous roundabouts , squares and streets named after hoover , wilson , washington , roosevelt or reagan as well . 
  this one 's a joke though , we do n't usually name places after * living * people ( the only exception being if you are a pope who happened to be born in poland ) . 
  as to why - usually we do it to honour the us politican who did something which benefited poland immensely , like reagan or wilson . 
  yeah , but i would say that the traditional polish way of enjoying those particular holidays which is how most people tend to do it is inherently * un * secular . 
  because personally , i do n't see anything secular about singing christmas songs about baby jesus , and then going to the mass at midnight . 
  that 's our doing . 
  you are cultural catholic if you do n't really care about religion in your daily life , though you keep observing the catholic traditions , participating in catholic holidays like easter , christmas or all saint 's day ( which might include going to the church on those days , even if one usualy do n't bother ) , etc. 
  i 'd say that out of our supposedly over 90 % catholic population , about half are only cultural catholics . 
   excuse me , courland is and has always been baltic clay . 
  well , baltics still were diligent subjects of the glorious commonwealth at the time . 
   was, 
  advocating * against * a common european ticket , comparing it to some nazi idea . 
   many of people in poland ( maybe the majority already ) wants to exit this communist/socialist experiment `` european union '' . 
  not yet , right now the general consensus is `` let 's stay in eu at least until the * wunderbar-magical-free-money-for-infrastructure * fountain runs out , and then we 'll see '' . 
  yes , we would have to invent several new symbols , or keep using digraphs and trigraphs to make it kinda bearable . 
  either way , in the end there are * no * advantages from adapting cyrillic , while there are countless disadvantages . 
  at this point , we could try to adapt katakana or bengali script well enough . 
  that would be even worse , with czech system we at least could keep writimg our language phonetically , cyrillic results in monstrosities like those seen earlier in this discussion . 
  switching to cyrillic so we end up like english and have to learn pronounciation separately from spelling sounds like a doubly shitty deal . 
   little late on spelling reform . 
  yeah , but thanks to this even texts from medieval times and renaissance are quite easily readable in original ortography . 
  we will never taint our glorious indigenous writing system with some cheap czech invention : dd and interestingly enough , the `` dz '' sound is spelled that way in every other language that also uses it . 
  '' \u0434\u0436 '' would be `` d\u017c '' . 
  we also have `` d\u017a '' , and even `` dzi '' ( which sounds slightly different from d\u017a , more vovel-like and can make a syllabe ) . 
  this version is not particularly close either . 
  anyhow , i have always thought cyrillic `` e '' to be an equivalent of our `` ie '' , and '' \u042d '' or '' \u0404 '' to mean our `` e '' . 
  it kinda used to be the `` official '' pronounciation until the interwar period ( though it was aleady rarely used by then ) , but by now it was replaced by `` english w '' pronounciation everywhere but some kresy dialects still remaining in lithuania and belarus . 
  that 's how polish transliteration of cyrillic works . 
  and yes , ie/e ; \u0142 / l and ci / \u0107 are all different sounds . 
  that would be `` szie\u0142ieszczjaci '' in polish spelling , definitely not . 
  at this point it could be the bengali script or incan quipu well enough , if we were going to change to something so exotic anyway . 
   one epic rune = one sound , no more digraphs . 
  we would have to dig up some funny looking symbols for \u0105 , \u0119 and \u0142 then , because i do n't recall either of them being in current form of cyrillic . 
  and with katakana we get one symbol = one * syllabe * , think about space conservation we gain this way if simple digraphs bother you so much !, 
   much benefits , already used by other slavs . 
  unfortunately , this is greatly outweighed by the `` ugly and looks like * russian * '' disadvantage . 
   why so serious ? 
  i still like my `` switch to katakana '' proposal much better . 
  it 's definitely much more plausible for starters . 
  uhm , so what 's exactly the difference other than the former looking like ugly russian-runes instead of being instantly recognizable as polish ? 
  for comparison , look how neat `` zbigniew kazimierz brzezi\u0144ski '' looks like in katakana : \u30ba\u30d3\u30b0\u30cd\u30d5 \u30fb \u30ab\u30b8\u30df\u30a8\u30b7\u30e5 \u30fb \u30d6\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc poles should switch to kana . 
  well , if we * had to * change to some alien writing system anyway , i 'd definitely chose this one over cyrillic anytime . 
  colonization * of africa * , mate . 
  you shall look back and read it carefuly . 
  in a long comment chain focused solely on africa it would appear to be a quite usual occurence for the discussion to remain on topic . 
  from what i 've gathered , that 's how conversations tend to work . 
  in a long comment chain focused solely on africa it would appear to be a quite usual occurence for the discussion to remain on topic . 
  about one post earlier . 
  in fact it was you who specifically mentioned it , i will even quote your exact words for convenience :  africa is a shithole because when europeans came they drew fake borders and made a society designed for extraction of resources , which they leaved and left in ruins in the second half of the 20 . century . 
  til t * h * ailand is in africa . 
  i have n't noticed ethiopia ( or liberia , though it kinda * was * a colony of us ) being significantly better off than the rest of africa . 
  quite the contrary to be honest . 
  it already was a shithole when europeans came there . 
  anyhow , i 'd take * zero * rate of terrorism over a low rate of it anytime .
