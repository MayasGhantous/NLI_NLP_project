  that 's just the perception i had back then . 
  maybe i just did n't notice it earlier because i was too young , but in my opinion gw took a nosedive in quality and influence ever since mid ' 00s . 
   this brings even more solid evidence for the `` very hated '' statement . 
  i 'm just saying that the fact that it * sells * , does n't mean it is * not * hated by a significant portion of the society , which is what you seem to imply . 
  personally , i am more * amused * by quality of their propaganda and their complete failure to even appear relatively neutral anymore , than * hate * it . 
  while i consider them way too inept to * hate * them , that 's definitely a quite common sentiment . 
  whether it 's 10 , 25 or perhaps 50 % , i have no idea , and frankly i do n't care . 
   leading position is n't monopoly . 
  hence * almost * . 
  rzeczpospolita was always there , sure , but it was a bit more * nich\u00e9 * . 
   second biggest does n't mean `` very hated '' . 
  you realise it is still being subscribed by many government offices , libraries , even every mcdonald 's , right ? 
  that significantly boosts their sales . 
  and most importantly , even if 10 % of poles ( which would already be an overstated figure ) reads it daily , it says * absolutely nothing * about another 90 % . 
   it 's the second biggest daily newspaper it was the first non-commie newspaper in poland , which resulted in them almost monopolising the press market in poland in the 90s ( gw used to be * the * newspaper ) . 
  it has been a steady decline due to their incredibly biased , agenda-pushing journalism ever since . 
  why ? 
  all it would take would be usd strenghtening to the norway krone by about 15 % . 
  entirely possible . 
  japan has been in stagnation for the last 20 years . 
   as a percentage of the total population, 
  as that 's footage from a polish tv , they are most likely poles . 
   at least have the decency to stop cutting up my sentences so you can take bits out of context . 
  if i quoted an intricately crafted compilation of similarly themed sentences from several posts , you would be probably accusing me of some other form of `` manipulation '' . 
  either way i ca n't win . 
   i believe sexism to be wrong . 
  i also believe sexist * discrimination * to be wrong . 
  which , coincidentally , is absolutely not the case here . 
   men and women should be equally represented by mainstream television . 
  `` i am not some crazy totalitarian monster , but i still would like content produced by private companies strictly controlled so muh feels are not hurt '' . 
   i do n't want the tv show taken off air or the people imprisoned because if there is only semi-naked lady and not an equally semi-naked dude . 
  great . 
   nothing/nobody is above criticism and it 's not an assault on their freedom of speech to criticise sexist behaviour or commentary on a television show . 
  and `` do n't watch it if you do n't like it , and perhaps make your own show that will suit you '' is a perfectly valid response to such criticism . 
   how incredibly rarely you see a man sexualised but not a woman in modern media perhaps it has something to do with the fact that one was proven to be a working advertising strategy , and the other one considerably less so . 
  news at 11 . 
   i like to think most people reading this comment thread will go `` why not have a half-naked man and a half naked woman - why does it matter ? '', 
  that 's exactly what i did . 
  `` why does it matter '' were my exact thoughts for the entire time i was reading your posts . 
   i 'm not forbidding them from making it ... 
  this was my point from the start . 
  you surely come off sounding as if you were . 
   my point was that i am allowed to say that i believe this to be wrong and i am allowed to say that the fact that * you * believe this to be wrong is completely irrelevant . 
   that they should cater to both men and women of all demographics . 
  no , they * should n't * . 
  it 's entirely their choice . 
  sure , it perhaps would be * nice * if their target audience was broader , but it 's perfectly alright either way . 
  * why * on earth catering only to men ( or women - or 15 year dudes specifically named robert and living somewhere in remote hills - whatever ) is something that bothers you so much , i completely fail to understand . 
  have you even read my posts ? 
  where exactly i said that what happened to poland between 1939 and 1989 is * greece * 's fault ? 
  what an absurdal idea !, 
  i just said that in 1989 greece was far richer than poland , and now that 's not the case anymore . 
  you were the one who tried to imply otherwise in the first place . 
   finally i hope you do n't get a corrupted government anytime we were ruled by corrupt scumbags for 50 years . 
  admitedly they still are kinda corrupted , but to much lesser extent than they used to be . 
  tv show is sexist , exactly . 
  so what , being sexist is * not * illegal . 
  they are entirely free to emit sexist programs if they think they will gain more watchers than lose this way , and you are entirely free to boycott such station ( and honestly , neither me nor you were ever going to watch albanian tv in the first place , so it 's a purely academic argument ) . 
  freedom of speech issue starts when you try to forbid them to do so because you feel offended by it . 
  oh , i know . 
  poland used to be far wealthier and better-off than greece until 1940s , before the ww2 and 40 years of soviet occupation . 
  you definitely got the better end of the stick during the second half of century though . 
  in 1990s you had like 5 times ours gdp per capita . 
  at least the commies lost the civil war , so you got that going for you . 
   for 7 years we had a dictatorship , you know , secret police banging in your at 3 am to take you for `` questioning that 's cute , now multiply the lenght of that period by six . 
  greece still got terribly * lucky * when compared to what all the other countries in the region had to go through . 
  yes , and if there was a state-owned ( so paid from our taxes ) radio channel broadcasting from the parliament dedicated solely to various antics * allegedly * commited by / u/pyrenomycetes and had `` 24h false equivalence '' as their slogan . 
  yeah , that would be kinda outraging . 
  such channel does n't exist to my best information though . 
  and i wonder whether you understand the subtle difference between * private enterprise * and a * public office * , because the only context in which your example would be relevant would be if you did n't . 
  i think it was supposed to be organized in a * convenient * location , like somewhere in the middle of the continent . 
  no monies for denbts this time i guess . 
   just because someone is free to do something does n't automatically mean it 's right or we should n't fight to change it . 
  what a completely alien , totalitarian way of thinking . 
  it 's * their * program : do n't like it - do n't watch it . 
  or even better , make your own one , with the exact characteristics you like if you think that enough people will want to watch it . 
  for now it seems that there is enough demand for this kind of programming , and there was n't enough demand for the kind of programming you would like to see , perhaps it 's a shame - i would n't watch either so i 'm not to judge , but i absolutely do n't see how `` equality '' would be in any way relevant here . 
   you do n't seem to understand that criticising something is exercising my own freedom of speech and i am criticizing your criticism , which you also apparently do n't seem to understand . 
  from / r/soccer during the world cup last year . 
  usa is seen as `` the last normal western country '' by many on the right thanks to your political spectrum being quite comparable to the one in poland . 
  this one in particular is aimed at the fad of changing the profile picture to a rainbow one , which most likely spilled a bit from usa after last week ( i did n't even know it was a thing before , i do n't recall seeing anyone doing it among my friends ) . 
   dude whatever the hell are you talking about ? 
  greece was one of the `` wealthiest '' eastern europe countries . 
  ... with * was * being a keyword here . 
  compared to all the other countries , they also had a `` 45-years-of-not-being-occupied-and-pillaged-by-soviet-fucking-union '' handicap . 
   reading the news and presenting a gameshow should not be solely aimed at straight dudes . 
  on the other hand , you should * not * be * forbidden * from making a gameshow/news solely aimed at straight dudes either , just like you should be free to make a programming targetting any desired demographics . 
  that 's the amazing thing about freedom of speech , but perhaps you should live in a country where it used to be restricted to fully understand it . 
  banki ? 
  we have a treaty with holy see which states that catholic church marriage is equivalent to the civil marriage , so you do n't have to bother having two ceremonies and can only marry at the church . 
  nothing preventing anyone from having only a civil marriage in a government office if one wants though , that 's just not the preferred form . 
   are you people really getting upset that a thread title , that is perfectly understandable in english , was not written in english ? 
  it 's * not * understandable , that 's the fucking problem . 
  i had to visit / r/worldnews to find out what exactly happened , because the / r/europe thread was unfortunately proven completely unreadable . 
  yeah , and scandinavia was one red army invasion away from becoming a part of the `` shitty '' half . 
   sm , lmao . 
  wyborcze for many years supported neoliberal model of polish transformation i.e. 
  used to be centrist . 
  ( far ) * right * would be advocating libertarianism , which unfortunately never was a mainstream position in poland . 
   ou deny that .
