  the fact that recently they changed the tone a little might mean they start to shift towards center towards * left * . 
  i do n't know in which socialist bubble such policies would be considered * centrist * , but fortunately i do n't live in it . 
   why would anyone shrink their perspective to only poland . 
  the `` what is the political spectrum of media * in your country * '' part of the question could be a little hint , though you have already proven multiple times that reading comprehension is not among your strong sides . 
   but from european perspective and from * polish * perspective it 's very leftist and nowhere near center ( though then again , from polish perspective american politics seems much more regular than politics in average western european country , so we kinda * are * an outlier here ) . 
  they are also the most openly biased popular media in poland , on par with pro-pis weeklies . 
   media are far-right liberal economy praisers . 
  ah , it 's just you , that guy for whom anything that is n't communist manifesto is `` far-right neoliberalism '' . 
  all that tourism monies have to go somewhere . 
   already `` still '' would be a better assesment of situation . 
  what the fuck , estonia . 
   which is an old term for a black person old ? 
  i 'd say it 's a pretty regular word for a black person . 
  the common opinion is that we are doing relatively well * despite * our politicians , not * thanks to * them, 
   not good the other main party in poland is really populist party named law and justice or something close they were going to win it anyway ( po has just lost the presidential elections with their candidate running as incumbent ) even before tape scandal * re * surfaced , but now they easily might have a 2/3 constitutional majority ( together with kukiz 's party ) . 
  i thought about leaving reddit for voat , but unfortunately their servers are too weak , so i do n't think it 's a viable alternative right now . 
  i really dislike this kind of selective moderation ( especially with those subsequent bans ) we observed yesterday and today . 
  \\  literally a po2 ( or uw3 ) \\  having any hopes in it, 
   does this mean i would be happier if i were czech instead of dutch ? 
  if such trend continues for next 20-30 years then yes , quite likely . 
  except that 's not what is shown on this graph . 
  i like how poles are the biggest group in area close to ystad , where ferries frim poland arrive . 
  it 's like we do n't even bother going further . 
   the baltics were eventually annexed , not occupied for 50 years . 
  by every metric they were three independent states illegally occupied by soviet union until 1990-91 , and their legitimate governments remained on exile for all this period . 
   they became full citizens with the same rights as other soviet citizens . 
  ... and ? 
  they still were occupied teritories . 
  he said `` stable '' . 
   kind of tells them that their language and presence is some kind of historical mistake their language and presence in estonia * is * some kind of historical mistake though . 
  it 's * literally * a result [ of soviet war crimes during their 50-years long occupation of estonia .

  you certainly could had lithuanian minority been numerous enough in poland to warrant such demand . 
  copper mines , along with hq of [ kghm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kghm_polska_mied%c5%ba ) - one of the biggest polish companies . 
   niderlandy on its own i 've seen `` niderlandy '' only when referring to the period before losing belgium . 
  ever since then , it 's pretty much always `` holandia '' . 
   what is this so called `` national movement '' ? 
  a nationalist political party . 
  i would definitely support them was i a nationalist , alas i find their programme rather flawed . 
   the fact that you deny plain facts [ ... ] , making you a nationalist . 
  alright , so what i got out of it is that * you * are a nationalist . 
   haha , the typical conspiracy-theorist bullshit . 
  yes , that 's a nice synopsis of all your posts in this thread so far . 
   no , nazis existed in most of the european countries * nazis * were a phenomenon almost exclusive to germany . 
  yes , other countries had their * fascists * or other far-right movements , but they usually were nowhere near as degenerated , barbaric and inhumane as the one in germany . 
   in germany they were a minority and were less than 10 % population . 
  with an active or silent support of overwhelming majority of germans . 
  keep going with this pathetic attempts in whitewashing your history . 
   lebensraum considering that we were about 1/3 * smaller * after this `` exchange '' than before that , i would consider this to be a rather shitty version of lebensraum , the very opposite of the whole idea in fact . 
  not to even mention that everything was decided in moscow by stalin because the polish government was unfortunately powerless on exile in london , where it remained until 1990 . 
   just make it clear that the average german was not a nazi . 
  precisely . 
  the * average * german * was * a nazi though , or at least was rather keen about them up until 1942-3 . 
  anti-nazi resistance in germany was a small and almost negligible minority . 
   where did i ever apologize nazis ? 
  where did i ever indicated that i am a member of the national movement ? 
  do n't forget the allmighty \u0141 and \u0143 . 
  i do n't need to talk with nazi apologists either ( if we are now going to call each other names ) . 
   the poles use former german territories as a lebensraum in compensation for their lost lands . 
  in a way , though ruins of breslau or stettin we got after the war were at least one class lower than lw\u00f3w or wilno we have lost . 
  we just lost * half * of our territory though , it 's not like we could be choosy . 
  but no , i would consider them to be our war compensation first and foremost . 
  for unprecedenced barbarism of german occupation . 
  for 20 % of polish population murdered ( until the ww2 poland was comparable in population size to italy or france ... not anymore ) . 
  for complete , deliberate planned destruction of warsaw , and destruction of significant part of our industry , infrastructure , and national heritage . 
  i do n't think germany could afford to pay for this trillion dollars worth of damages otherwise . 
   only about 40 % of the population voted for them * only 40 % * , literally noone . 
   the germans were told that poland attacked germany and that they were fighting a defensive war . 
  do n't try to make it look as it was a crusade . 
  poor , poor gullible germans . 
   my people did n't start the war . 
  nah , it totally were the mysterious aliens called `` nazis '' who came from the `` nazi '' planet . 
   a government that ruled over my people did , a government which was chosen in democratic elections ( and was already quite clear on their intentions even at that point ) , and enjoyed high support ( as long as germany was winning the war ) . 
  [ geographical distribution of votes for nsdap is also somewhat interesting in context of this conversation . 
  ] ( http://www.akens.org/akens/texte/diverses/konferenz/karte_dr_28_33.gif )  as well as another government that for some reason keeps being forgotten . 
  i would n't call the ribbentropp-molotov pact and soviet union 's involvement in starting the ww2 particularly * forgotten * , though it definitely gets less attention than the german one . 
   so why are there poles living in the cities built by germans ? 
  for the exact same reason there are lithuanians , ukrainians or belarusians living in the cities `` built by poles '' . 
  stalin * really * liked redrawing various maps . 
   and before that germanic tribes lived there up to crimea . 
  and before them there were celtic tribes , and who knows who else even earlier . 
  i think you get the point by now . 
   and before the ostsiedlung , only very few people lived there . 
  it was the most densely populated part of medieval poland , so while it was n't northern italy population density , it was n't uninhabited wasteland either . 
   towns like breslau or danzig were built by germans . 
  by german settlers invited by polish dukes ruling at the time . 
   germans were the majority there for a couple centuries before prussia conquered it . 
  [ citation needed ]  there were almost no poles living there . 
  which explains overwhelmingly polish toponyms up until 18th century , when they started to be translated to german by the prussian administration , and polish names showing up frequently in church records up until similar point in time . 
  until prussian conquest population of silesia was mostly polish , with some german villages and mostly-german cities . 
   you clearly are a nationalist . 
  i do n't even want to waste my time with you . 
  hehe , * i * am a nationalist here , sure , whatever helps you sleep at night . 
  keep getting salty everytime someone mentions poland though , it 's hillarious . 
  oh , but poles ( or rather the west-slavic old-polish speakers , because it 's not like nationalities existed in the same way back then as they exist now ) were a majority in entirety of modern western poland before ostsiedlung . 
  you are just salty because the same thing germans have been doing for centuries suddenly happened to you . 
  and in silesia , because i presume this is the particular region we are talking about , that was the case as late as 18th century . 
  only after prussia conquered it in 1742 situation started to shift significantly . 
  i wo n't even mention lands grabbed by prussia from poland in 1772 and 1815 which rightfuly returned to poland after versailles treaty in 1919 , because germans ( despite their best colonization efforts ) never were majority there . 
   i could have put slavic countries but not all of them are .
