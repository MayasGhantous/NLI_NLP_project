  so you * did n't * meant slavic countries then , as the peculiarity you seem to be interested in is the fact that they suffered under the soviet ocupation for half of century , not their language family . 
  the fundamental difference you seem to have missed is that it were the neighbouring countries which * came to * their hungarian minorities , and not the other way around . 
  yet . 
  also , look up the south china sea dispute if you think they do n't . 
  good riddance . 
  so is norway and iceland . 
  on this particular map it 's eu + efta . 
  looks familiar . 
  i guess [ this one ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=lasnam%c3%a4e&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xqluvb-_ksgnsghdmyhgdw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;q=ursyn%c3%b3w ) might be warsaw 's equivalent of it . 
  [ this one is in the fucking centre of the city ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=lasnam%c3%a4e&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xqluvb-_ksgnsghdmyhgdw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;q=za+%c5%bcelazn%c4%85+bram%c4%85 ) though , and i do n't think anything beats this monstrosity . 
   against russia ? 
  fuck no . 
  if we are now thinking about a scenario in which russia wo n't use wmds ( because , well , everyone is fucked once nukes start to be launched ) our forces are certainly strong enough to hold ground until us army ( and the rest of nato ) arrives . 
  it 's not like russia would use 100 % of their forces in such strike either , they have a lot of territory to defend . 
  imagine a typical boring and ugly commieblock estate on the outskirts of the city planned according to the sickest visions of le corbusier . 
  now make it 20 times bigger and have it * instead * of the city , because * nothing * in the city survived the ww2 and only a few selected landmarks were rebuilt . 
  and there are some a bit more bearable modern buildings built in empty spaces between commieblocks . 
  congratulations , now you have seen warsaw . 
  shame , because it was such a great city while it still existed . 
  at least for polish , half of those seem completely random . 
  not surprised by `` jan pawe\u0142 ii '' , `` polska '' or `` warszawa '' making the top though . 
  support of knp-without-korwin is 0.1 % though . 
   congress of the new right it 's called korwin ( * coalition of polish republic 's renewal - freedom and hope * ) now . 
   they do n't have any documents well , you are certainly not helping your point by pointing out that . 
  for all we know , they might be wanted criminals fleeing the justice system who threw their documents out in order to avoid identification . 
   centuries of statelessness a ** century ** of statelessness . 
  an important distinction , because you make it sound as if it was a half of millenium or something , and only then a mysterious polish nation suddenly appeared out of thin air . 
  also , as you can read in the very article you have linked , polish nationalism started to develop * the very moment * we have lost our independence , or even right before that moment . 
  the following 100 years of being divided between the three empires , along with 50 years of soviet occupation were obviously important to its development , but so were the preceding 800 years of polish statehood half of which we spent as one of the primary european powers . 
  our sense of national identity is a hybrid of those factors , and in your posts you observe a very narrow portion of it , which leads to hillariously inaccurate results . 
   you are not understanding what i 'm saying at all , sorry you are neither particularly knowledgeable on the topic , nor are results of your analysis an accurate description of the current state of affairs . 
  i understand very well what you are saying - unfortunately you are completely missing the point and while i appreciate your efforts , they are laughable at best . 
   here you 've conflated me saying the polish people struggled for a national identity with some sort of argument that polish culture did n't exist or that poland was n't a country . 
  well , perhaps if you have n't literally claimed that we * lacked * national identity which is quite synonymous with both things you mentioned here , we could avoid this problem . 
   that obviously leads to a crisis in identity , i do n't need to explain why . 
  * crisis * in national identity is not the same as * lack * of it . 
   read : mainly . 
  i do n't pretend to know about the austrian part but it was just as tossed about as the rest , if not more . 
  considering the last several centuries , it had the most peaceful history out of entirety of modern poland , but keep going , it 's fascintating . 
   mate , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  you are more catholic because it 's an important part of your identity that differentiates you from the rest . 
  which once again disproves your claim about `` lack of national identity '' . 
  also , it was already an important part of our identity when we were still in great powers tier , so there goes your another claim . 
   again , i 've just said it was an effect of centuries of being tossed around and subsequent understandable overcompensation unfortunately you just never said anything concrete on this topic , and as you keep failing to clarify on that it remains an empty claim . 
  there were many countries that were `` tossed around '' for much longer than us , and we are not an outlier by any means - quite the contrary considering that we were late to this club as it only started ~ 250 years ago . 
   modern polish nationalism arose as a movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries `` modern polish nationalism arose around the time the * very idea of nationalism * was coined in europe '' . 
  how exactly it is connected to your `` no national identity '' absurdal claim , i have no idea . 
  the latter part merely states the obvious course of action in a situation when your territory just got occupied by foreign and ( with exception of austria ) hostile powers . 
   nah it was more to do with the fact that poland overcompensated for a previous lack of national identity stemming from centuries of being played around . 
   lack of national identity `` poland had no national identity before it was suddenly invented in 1989 '' . 
  this alone was a one big `` i have no idea what i 'm talking about '' flag , but , masochistic as i am , i kept reading curious to find out what other revelations i 'll find . 
   stemming from centuries of being played around literally * centuries * . 
  two of them . 
  and yes , they * are * important especially considering how big part of our national identity is `` for centuries we used to be a great empire that lately fallen due to inside and outside factors , but despite that we managed to survive and reborn ... twice '' , which due to circumstances gradually replaced the earlier `` we are the great and powerful country of the free people , with the most perfect type of government in the world , comparable only to roman republic '' one . 
  then again , if * poland * has a `` lack of national identity '' , i do n't know who does n't . 
   this backlash is seen mainly in parts that used to belong to russia , which also explains why the more conservative and nationalist party has by far the strongest support in the region that in 19th century was ruled by austria , and where poles had autonomy so vast that compared to either russian or german-occupied parts it was almost as good as if it remained independent poland . 
  but at this point i am completely unsurprised by your absolute lack of knowledge about poland . 
   a lack of national identity is also why poland is very catholic compared to , at this point i start to doubt whether you have any idea what this `` lack of national identity phrase '' you keep using ever means . 
  catholicism is * a part * of our national identity . 
   you look at eastern bloc countries or areas ( like east germany ) , most of them are more left leaning than right . 
  they have n't spent the last 10 to 15 years of soviet occupation on active anti-communist mass resistance , but suddenly were freed of it after ussr started to collapse , so it 's only understandable . 
   exceptions being poland and hungary who both went through more nationalistic phases after the fall of the ussr . 
  another interesting discovery . 
  so , when exactly was our `` nationalistic phase '' , between 2005 and 2007 ? 
  i do n't think i ever had an occasion to read such a pile of condensed uninformed crap as your post , but it was a fun ride . 
  comedy gold . 
   to think it 's ex-communist . 
  oh , but that 's * precisely * the reason why poland is so right wing . 
  communist rule was so shitty and incompetent , it basically compromised anything even remotely left-wing/socialist for many generations ( if not forever ) . 
  they were either deported to siberia and kazakhstan in 1940 and 1941 and died there ( at least several hundred thousands , though total is most likely a bit lower than 1 million ) , were resettled to now-western poland after the war ended ( 2.3 million total ) , and some of them ( several hundred thousands ) remained in their homes in now-lithuanian and belarusian ssr ( in contrast , almost all poles from the now-ukrainian ssr who survived the war got resettled ) and remain a significant minoriry in both countries nowadays . 
  of course it is . 
  it 's more than enough to have a grasp about where each party stands though , and there is no need to write a novel-long post about how the `` centre-right party '' completely ignores their own programme while ruling and only focuses on winning elections , or how the `` right wing party '' absorbed the populist electorate back in 2007 to someone who does n't really care about polish politics , do n't you think ? 
  the division shown on this map is basically forest vs farmland . 
  population density in northern and western poland is lower , as population is predominantly urban while the countryside is forested . 
  on the other hand , population density in southern and eastern poland is higher , thanks to high rural population scattered between ( a bit less frequent ) cities and towns .

  it is , but their combined support is in 5-10 % range , and they are not considered to be major parties . 
  orange is pro-eu centre-right , blue is pro-us right-wing . 
  more like a bit less than 1/3 of the country . 
   yes , taxes were the biggest problem of communist poland . 
  i do n't know how to reply . 
  yes , you misunderstood my post on purpose ( or perhaps i have n't worded my post clear enough this time , who knows ) so obviously you do n't know how to reply . 
  let me rephrase this very sentence you have quoted in a most straightfoward way : total incompetence of commies left our country underdeveloped and impoverished ( and despite swift progress in last 26 years we still have n't fully recovered from that ) . 
  because of that , our population is not wealthy enough to afford paying high taxes * right now * . 
  how could you conclude from this that my opinion is that taxes were the * biggest * problem about soviet-occupied poland , i have no idea , that 's some absolutely exotic sense of logic . 
   taxes are robbery in general , of course they are . 
  a situation in which a powerful organization takes money from you ( by force , if not given voluntarily ) regardless of your consent would be consistent with my definition of robbery . 
  that 's not to disregard the fact that admitably to some extent ( police , army , justice system , crucial infrastructure ) it 's justifiable and benefitial , and could be alternatively described as `` mandatory state-usage fee '' , just like there is one for using electricity , water or gas . 
  in general though , the more money is left in citizens ' pockets , the better - especially in a country so devastated by years of socialist `` economy '' as poland where many people can barely afford to live on the money left after paying all their taxes . 
   man , you should sue them . 
  oh , i certainly would if i saw any chance of winning . 
   see that 's why you are in incoherent because there was no robbery , it was rightful recovery . 
  and factories stolen in 40s from their owners , were also `` rightfuly recovered '' , yes , that 's quite typical socialist rethoric . 
  at least this time you managed not to murder anyone in process , so there is some kind of progress . 
   and i am constantly reminding you that no other healthy economy introduced such a mandatory pensions system and that 's cool , but unfortunately in no way relevant to our discussion which is , i 'd like you to remind you , focused on forceful seizure of hundreds of billions pln in private assets by the state . 
   forcing to give money to private companies is a robbery . 
  oh shit , entire mandatory car insurance system is robbery . 
   you are confused about who is the robber here .
