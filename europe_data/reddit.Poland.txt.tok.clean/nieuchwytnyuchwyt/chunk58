  i would consider that rather close to being `` one-sided '' . 
  yeah , they totally had a choice . 
  they could chose to be executed by nazis , sounds like an amazing deal . 
   volyn tragedy hehe , i could easily identify which country the poster was from without even looking at the flair . 
  in poland it 's called either `` volhynia genocide '' , `` volhynia slaughter '' or `` volhynia massacre/crime '' , with * rze\u017a wo\u0142y\u0144ska * one being the most common one . 
  that still does n't disregard anything that i said . 
  i was n't talking about overall inequality statistics , and neither were you in the post i initially replied to . 
  russia has much greater inequality in the highest wealth tier , which is contrary to what you claimed . 
  you should also factor in the fact that beeing poor in usa and being poor in russia mean two entirely different things . 
  it 's definitely * less bad * to be poor in usa than in russia . 
  yeah , all that generations long plotting against poland , ending up in first declaring independence from us , and eventually annexing a significant part of our country , yet in the end his descendants fuck up everything . 
  i definitely would be really pissed off in the place of bismarck . 
   that in the future , poland would have most of the eastern prussia . 
  bismarck 's reply : `` again ? 
  guess that our 200-year long rebelion against our rightful sovereigns will eventually come to an end . '', 
  yeah , actually that 's completely not the case . 
  remember all that talk in usa about the `` richest 1 % '' a few years ago ? 
  that 's over 3 million people who hold over 35 % of nation 's wealth . 
  in comparison , 35 % of wealth in russia is in hands of * 110 * richest oligarchs . 
  usa less equal my ass . 
   bucharest seems richer than warsaw yeah , but then again half of cities in poland * seem * richer than warsaw . 
  warsaw is a big , ugly commieblock estate built in 60s and 70s by the worst generation of corbusier-wannabie city planners on site of the old city of warsaw which , while rather nice , was unfortunately razed to the ground by germans in 1944 . 
   the old town of bucharest is hands down better than the not so old town of warsaw . 
  the only part of the old town in warsaw that was rebuilt was the small 14-15th century part that already existed while warsaw was still a little provincional town nowhere near the likes of metropolies like krak\u00f3w , gda\u0144sk or toru\u0144 . 
  it 's literally * a * medieval polish little town like hundreds of them , you are * not * supposed to be impressed about it . 
   ( but then bucharest has bigger population ( city ) than warsaw so somehow it 's expected ) that 's because unlike in warsaw , bucharest city boundaries include most of agglomeration . 
  warsaw metro area is far bigger than bucharest metro area . 
   ( warsaw , wroclaw and krakow in poland and too many cities in romania ) there are no romanian cities comparable in size with pozna\u0144 , wroc\u0142aw or krak\u00f3w , as even the bigges of them like cluj are more in bia\u0142ystok , cz\u0119stochowa or radom tier . 
  yeah , they are halfway between ukraine and poland , not bad . 
  they are also an authoritarian dictatorship heavily dependent on russia , so i think i 'll pass . 
  [ wow , romania was almost richer than poland in 1990 .

  actually , three highrises in the center of warsaw ( z\u0142ota 44 , twarda 2/4 and \u0141ucka city ) are primarily apartment buildings , the rest are indeed office buildings . 
   look kazhastan that has almost the same gdp per capita then poland . 
  yeah , but then even * russia * has almost the same gdp per capita than poland ( and in both cases hardly anyone in poland would believe it if told so ) . 
  even more interesting thing is the fact that saudi arabia has higher gdp per capita than poland . 
  you have to be really talented to be a petrostate with such vast ammounts of natural resources , and still be * below * the level of poland . 
  it 's not * banned * , for in fact the issue of same-sex marriage is not explicitly mentioned * at all * . 
  article 18 of the constitution simply states that : * `` marriage , being a union of a man and a woman , as well as the family , motherhood and parenthood , shall be placed under the protection and care of the republic of poland . 
  '' * `` outside the legal definition of marriage '' would be the correct description of the situation . 
  it would end up in a complete defeat for the pro-same-sex-marriage side , and results of such referendum would serve for many years as yet another argument against it in public disclosure . 
  i guess that 's not exactly the result people frequenting / r/europe proposing this kind of referendum would have in mind . 
   western europe mostly dubs their movies . 
  eastern europe mostly sub their movies . 
  in poland our movies get a monotone-voiceover type dub . 
  poland semi-western europe confirmed . 
   disproportional i 'm not sure if you aware of this obscure fact , but both `` parts '' of europe ( as much as i disagree with this outdated convention from 1950s ) are rather similar populationwise . 
  nothing `` disproportional '' about that . 
  we have to get to know our enemy after all . 
  yeah , i would much prefer simply having a billateral polish-american alliance as well . 
  it 's not like it 's * de facto * going to be any different in an unlikely case we would need defensive assistance , and this way there would be much less bullshit to deal with . 
  historical solidarity is seen as * anti-socialist * , even if in fact it was a worker union , and literally noone cares about anarchist factions because they were comletely irrelevant in the big picture . 
  both socialism and communism are dead ideas in poland , as they are automatically associated with soviet occupation , and used almost exclusively as insults , and anyone who would try to promote such ideas in public disclosure would be immediately disregarded as a fringe nutjob . 
  so that not being the case in some european countries indeed was a shock to me . 
  yeah , the first time i have ever seen * actual * socialists was here on reddit . 
  it felt * so * out of place that at first i thought it must be some kind of an elaborate prank , but after a while it turned out they * genuinely * believe in what they say . 
  that was the moment when i started to feel like in a historical movie or perhaps as if i entered some kind of a time machine and moved 50 years backwards . 
  uhm , no shit mate , that 's exactly why i commented . 
  if we got conquered like 20 times , or so , the joke could even actually be funny but , * alas * , that 's not the case . 
  [ the 1655-1660 swedish invasion of poland . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ) in a way , it was a bit like a 17th century version of ww2 eastern front - as sweden 's attack was swift and at some point we almost completely lost , yet in the end we have eventually won , with incredibly heavy losses - one of the best examples of pyrrhic victory . 
  though , proportionally , it was even * worse * than ww2 . 
  swedes completely pillaged a better part of our country for five years , stole countless ammounts of wealth , artworks , and monuments ( many of them still can be found in swedish museums nowadays ) , completely destroyed ** hundreds ** of cities and killed 1/3 of polish population . 
  the damage inflicted by the swedish invasion singlehandedly caused the commonwealth to drop from great powers tier , and until * today * we have never returned there . 
  oh , and prussia used this occasion to declare independence from poland , and during the following century they grew to be another powerful and agressive enemy of us . 
  yes , the commonwealth was already undergoing some rather serious turmoil at the time , but without the decisive blow of deluge , there would be no partitions a century later , and the history of our country would be completely different , that 's why i consider it to be the most important event in our history . 
  i 'd say 1385 , when jogaila married jadwiga of poland , and the polish-lithuanian personal union started is more significant . 
  1569 was merely enclosing of already close union , 1385 was what completely changed poland 's focus for everything beyond that point . 
   only guy with a monument that enfuriates me more is dmowski . 
  aka the guy who was solely responsible for official recognition of the polish claim to great poland and pomerania and who was leading the polish foreign policy in western europe during and right after the ww1 so well , he managed to get us support of entente even though we fought on the side of central powers for almost entire war . 
  even if one disagrees with his political views , his contribution to the recreation of polish statehood after a century of occupation is indubitable and he certainly deserves a monument , just like pi\u0142sudski does , even if he conducted a coup d'etat in 1926 . 
  maybe in austria . 
  he is definitely seen as hungarian around here . 
   nothing is good everything is shit official motto of poland 20 more years of such uninterrupted ground , and maybe the motto will change . 
  thanks to commies shitting all over our country with their ridiculous incompetence , our economy was subsaharan-levels-bad 25 years ago . 
  yes , it has greatly improved by now , but it 's not like it 's already perfect . 
  i was not aware that years in czech republic and hungary are one month long . 
  shit , it looked great on my phone . 
  [ this one will do as well , i guess ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/regionyhistpolski.png/1000px-regionyhistpolski.png ) , it 's even more detailed but for whatever reason it calls mazury this weird `` prusy '' name so i did n't want to use it . 
  [ i 'm not sure whether we * really * called it mazury , but we certainly do now . 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/historiopedia/images/c/ce/polskie_regiony.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131121155139&amp;path-prefix=pl ) it does n't sound ... evil , which certainly is an improvement . 
  40 years of suffering under a brutal , oppressive far-left dictatorship that managed to take and hold power only thanks to being backed by the armed forces of our biggest historical enemy occupying our country for all this period tends to do that to you . 
   poland if you wanted to list countries where us did `` something bad '' then you failed miserably , because the only complaint we had about that one in poland was `` why not sooner ? 
  we 've been waiting 40 years for it '' . 
  it 's not like we have all those statues , streets and parks named after reagan just for lulz . 
   interested in how hard it would be for the average ukranian or the average russian to learn polish ? 
  kinda like learning german for a swede i guess . 
  maybe even a bit easier , since ukrainian has many polish influences from the commonwealth times . 
  yeah , i also find it hard to differ between the east slavic languages , and to my polish ear they all melt into some semi-incomprehensible `` ruski '' one , but i assume it 's ukrainian more often than russian . 
  that rebellous polish province that finally returned to the fatherland in 1945 ? 
  : dd we also changed the name because the old one had a bad vibe to it . 
  can confirm , in warsaw i can hear ukrainian spoken on streets and in public transport on daily basis . 
   ca n't be more conservative than duda . 
  ca n't be too * non-conservative * either , because he 'll lose all his moderately-right-wing part of voting base this way . 
  the left wing electorate in poland is far less numerous than either centrist or right wing one and the only thing you 'll manage by pandering to them too obviously is losing the elections disastrously . 
   and all his views are basically what catholic church doctrine says , it 's as far right as you can go without being a priest . 
  last time i checked that almost passed off as `` centrism '' in poland . 
  it 's definitely nothing * radical * , that would be the braun guy who wanted to start a polish nuclear weapons programme and saw a jewish conspiracy behind everything , or nationalists from ruch narodowy ( who , while considerably milder when compared to their ukrainian , greek or hungarian counterparts , are definitely on the `` far '' side of the spectrum ) . 
   i 'd like to see nato abolished we would just sign a bilateral alliance with usa the very next day , so it 's not * that * bad idea after all . 
  it 's not like any other nato country is going to help us if shit hits the fan anyway so nothing would really change .
