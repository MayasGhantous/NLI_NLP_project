  if that is your reply , i do n't think you have understood my post at all . 
  russia and saudi arabia ? 
  that 's an odd choice . 
  though i definitely would n't have anything against `` going live in usa or singapore '' , thank you very much . 
   why are you in the eu because it 's beneficial and convenient to us in economical and political sense , and most of our military allies are also in there . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  that does n't mean i am * personally obliged * to agree with every single thing eu produces . 
  politics is an art of compromise , and while i support the death penalty in a few exceptional cases , and would definitely like it to return to our legal system , i find securing the development of my country a definitely more important issue . 
  sometimes you have to sacrifice one thing you support for another one , and this is one of such cases . 
   everything else is just details . 
  that explains why usa , japan and singapore ( and every single country in the world for 99.9 % of history , for that matter ) are literally nazi germany reincarnated , with mass genocide going on , millions of foreign nationals forced into slave work , and everything . 
  `` it existed in nazi germany , so it 's bad '' is a non-argument . 
   makes me wonder what your problem with the nazis is . 
  i also wonder whether you think that actions of the roman government after the vesuvius eruption were insufficient , and what is your opinion about the state of peruvian economy . 
  we can have an `` unrelated random topics '' discussion , why not . 
  welcome to the `` we do n't want to enter the eurozone '' club , romania . 
  it 's quite cozy here . 
  literally the only reason we have abolished death penalty in 1997 was to be able to join the eu . 
  despite many years passing since then , support for it remains very high . 
  www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2011/k_060_11.pdf , page 9 though i do n't see hungary having much success , in unlikely case they would succeed the debate in poland will likely be opened again ( the current stance is `` we ca n't , because we 'll be kicked out from eu '' ) . 
  [ and this one 's from angle quite similar to the one in op , for comparison . 
  ] ( http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5494/9216396163_edc506ee37_b.jpg ) a few years old , but that 's the most similar perspective i could find . 
   constantinople falling was problematic because it was too far away for many of the larger kingdoms to consider marching an army to at the time [ it 's not like byzantine was completely ignored ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusade_of_varna ) . 
  hell , one of our most promising kings [ lost his life , while trying to reverse the turkish advance before it was too late . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_varna ) maybe the hypotetical conquest of italia would be at reversed at some point , but that in iberia it took about 700 years , it 's not entirely certain . 
  either way , luckily it never happenned . 
   why do you consider constantinople/istanbul lost ? 
  it 's a great city . 
  great city , but sadly not european anymore . 
  again , good for turks , congrats on successful conquest . 
   sigh . 
  like i said , anatolian turks are largely greek genetically . 
  oh , but i know that . 
  in fact , i recall i had a discussion / r/mapporn where i was claiming it a month or two ago . 
  ... just that does n't really mean anything . 
  african americans are genetically mostly descendants of subsaharan african tribes . 
  does n't mean there 's much connection between them nowadays . 
   do you consider the island of malta `` lost '' too , the tiny and laregely irrelevant island of malta is nowhere comparable to rome or constantinople . 
  even if it was inhabited in 100 % by arab fanatical muslims nowadays i doubt i would care . 
  the more so , considering it 's not the case , and despite adapting another language malta remains rather european in culture . 
  that 's hardly the case with turkey , even considering that they are undergoing an europeisation process since atat\u00fcrk ( though lately it might seem it 's stopping or even being reversed ) . 
   however , even ignoring the historical impossibility it just * seems * impossible , because the fact that rome just is there seems like something obvious and taken for granted . 
  similarly , in a world where turks never took constantinople and it remained greek , any implication that it could happen would appear as absurdal as culturally arabic rome . 
  i consider both rome and constantinople to be similarly important to the european history , and would deeply grieve over the loss of either . 
  i 'm glad that throughout centuries europe lost only * one * of them ( and that similar to the turkish conquest of anatolia and balkans arabic conquest of iberia was ultimately reversed ) . 
   i fail to see the relevance of anything you just said and i fail to see relevance of anything you said in the post i have previously replied to - and that 's exactly why i replied this way . 
   oh , and somebody notify malta that their country needs to be ethnically cleansed , the fact that you jump to such conclusions says much about you . 
  i never said anything about ethnic cleansing ( well , turks already got rid of the remaining original inhabitiants of constantinople in the [ greek genocide of 1920s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) , but that 's not the point ) , turks won , europe lost , good for them . 
  i 'm just sad that the central asian turkic tribes had out of all places chosen to settle in such important to european culture place 600-700 years ago . 
  that 's all . 
  in some pararell-history reddit : `` i wish arabs never conquered italia in the middle ages so rome would still be there . '', 
  `` the rome that arabs conquered was a barren , depopulated husk of its former glory , thanks to germanic armies destroying and draining the city of its remaining wealth a few centuries earlier . 
  jesus christ it 's like / r/european in here . 
  the arabs pumped so much vitality into that city almost immediately that al-rum would hardly be recognizable compared to the rome that the visigoths and vandals shat on and left to rot . 
  we ca n't be certain that the colosseum would even be here at all if 9th century europeans had kept control of the city , and the green mosque ( on the site of former st. peter basilica ) is another beautiful addition to alrum . 
  but nooo dirty somewhat-brown people ( saracens share a lot of italic genetics - they just speak an arabic language ) should n't taint glorious ~ ~ white ~ ~ european civilization . '', 
  yes , this is exactly what you would say in an universe where arabs took hold of southern italy during their conquests , and there never was any successful reconquista after that . 
  you are entitled to your opinion , and i am entitled to find your opinion immensely stupid . 
   the constantinople that turks conquered was a barren , depopulated husk of its former glory and i 'd still consider it being a barren , depopulated husk ( that would recover eventually ) a better outcome than being replaced by a completely different city of a foreign non-european alien civilization . 
  so one of the most important to the european history places - a greek city of constantinople would still be around . 
  hagia sophia not being defaced by those ugly minarets would be a nice bonus as well . 
  longpoland is long . 
  good riddance . 
  inviting teutonic knights to defend our northern border is widely considered to be one of the biggest mistakes in our history . 
   not because they came here jews * came * here though . 
  polish chavy rappers roleplaying as albanian gangsters . 
  it 's for lulz . 
  ^ ( i hope . ), 
   i doubt there many with the balls or the wherewithal to actually kill a russian biker . 
  they almost burnt down the russian embassy in warsaw during the annual nationalist march-riots back in 2013 , so i would n't be so sure . 
  the biggest negative influence this disaster had on poland was the fact that the already very advanced construction of our first nuclear power plant was halted and ultimately cancelled because of this hysteria . 
   because i wrote a thread about prometheism that challenged the historical vision of poland as an eternal martyr challenged ? 
  if anything , you further strengthened such image by doing that . 
  we were not a `` stupid '' , unprepared , oblivious `` martyr '' , but a `` martyr '' who basing on his past experiences did all he could to prevent them from happening again , but even then in the end it was completely futile . 
  prometheism was a natural conclusion of both the `` christ of europe '' mentality of 19th century , and of `` for yours and ours freedom '' motto of poland . 
  betraying our ukrainian allies in 1921 , and signing a limited-victory peace treaty with bolsheviks instead of liberating ukraine was a big mistake . 
  you also had a fair share of blatant lies and manipulations in that thread , like implying that poland somehow `` attacked '' czechoslovakia in 1919 , while actually the exact opposite situation took place . 
  and to resolve such situation , czechoslovakia proceeded to make the * entirety * of the disputed territory a de facto czechoslovak territory . 
  flawless logic indeed . 
   well , by this sentence you confirmed that poland was one who broke the deal from november 5 , 1919 . 
  yes , we did . 
  and that still in any way did n't justify the czech annexation of that territory . 
  it was a typical landgrab like many in post ww1-europe with a convenient excuse . 
   and was first , who deployed troops in their part of cieszyn seeing that those troops were * attacked * by the czech troops , and the territory grabbed by czechoslovakia , it seems to me it was a wise decision . 
  shame most of our army was kinda busy fighting bolsheviks at that time , so they were beaten by czechs . 
  the whole pr nightmare of 1938 could be avoided then . 
   like attacking a newly created and neutral czechslowakia in 1919 uhm , mate ... this article literally states that it was * czechoslovakia * that ** attacked ** poland - or rather the etnic polish territory on the polish side of the demarkation line . 
  yes , we started preparations to elections there , but it 's not an excuse to invade and annex such area . 
  i 'm quite sure that this situation was one of the crucial things that influenced pi\u0142sudski when he decided to take wilno by force . 
   so you give me nothing neither did you , we took our wielkopolska back ourselves in 1918 . 
   you see why alot of germans dislike poles ( not all , but alot ) it should n't come off as a surprise that many poles dislike germans as well , but as those your type fortunately seem less and less numerous , our opinion on you also proportionally changes . 
   then you can have wielkopolska in my incredible gratitude i allow you to have sachsen and bayern , but nothing more . 
  if we are going by `` birthplaces '' now , i 'd like to remind you that germans were occupying the birthplace of the polish state ( wielkopolska , i believe you lazily called it * posen province * ) for over a century . 
   warshaw is more culturally important to poles nah , we moved our capital to warsaw rather recently ( 1596 ) , because it was halfway between krak\u00f3w and wilno which were both capitals , and it was a bit of a hassle to constantly travel between them . 
   poland did reject an alliance with the ussr yeah , because lithuania , latvia and estonia have proven how beneficial an * alliance * with ussr can be . 
   through allowing poland to rent prussia , and guess what , the rent is up nah , actually we were allowing germans to rent prussia since 1226 . 
  teutonic knights , worst tenants ever , never again . 
  [ 1942 note of polish government on exile informing allies about holocaust ongoing in german-occupied poland ] ( http://www.doomedsoldiers.com/the-mass-extermination-of-jews-in-german-occupied-poland.html ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbegota http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_righteous_among_the_nations http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust, 
   shared `` pain '' during war or tough times is not what i personally call close cultural ties neither is shared language group , otherwise haitians , portuguese and romanians would be closer to each other than to anyone else outside that language group . 
   are you familiar with ukrainian folklore ?
