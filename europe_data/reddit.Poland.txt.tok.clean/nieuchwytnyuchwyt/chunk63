   you want marriage to stay exclusively between man and woman because ? 
  because the word `` marriage '' was always exclusively used to describe such kind of union . 
  if the state considers benefitial to officially recognize other kinds of relationships as well , that 's alright , but they still by definition are n't `` marriages '' , and i find such attempts on manipulating the language silly and petty at best . 
   first of all marriage is a civil institution in many countries , and you can get married without church getting involved in any way , and these marriages do not have anything to do with religion and whatnot . 
  how is it even related to my post ? 
  not even once i have mentioned in my post church or religion , yet you have spent three paragraphs fighting such ( completely unrelated ) strawman argument . 
   human sacrifices ,  slavery  not trying to force usage of the word `` marriage '' to describe a civil union which by an odd coincidence is not encompassed by the original and traditional definition of the word `` marriage '' . 
  hm , i wonder whether one of those is not really like the others . 
  the problem with interslavic is that it 's really easy to * understand * passively even without any preparation ( if you already know any slavic language ) , but if you want to * speak * it actively , you actually have to put a similar ammount of effort to learn it you would with any other slavic language . 
  ** checkers republic ** [ official war flag ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/filepicker%2fiwhcbc9otfubbu9pkezs_checkered_flag.jpg ), 
   we do n't live in those sorts of times anymore . 
  the most prevalent worldview among the polish ruling class in 18th century was `` we are a non-beligerent and peaceful country , and we neither threaten our neighbours nor we want to , so we do n't need a strong army '' . 
  unfortunately , such worldview was n't shared by the neighbours of poland , which ( along with the heavy degeneration of our once innovative proto-democratic political system ) led to the demise of the commonwealth in 1790s . 
  yes , the world changed , but do we really do n't live in those sorts of times anymore ? 
  perhaps , but in 1910s people also thought that - yes , there was an international tension , and many probably expected a short decisive war at some point , but the extent of ww1 surprised everyone . 
  i wish i could say that * nowadays * we really do n't live in those sorts of times anymore , but that 's not true . 
  we all see what 's been happening in ukraine for the last 1.5 years , there 's a constant war in many regions outside europe , and even if an all-out total war seems unthinkable , in fact it 's exactly as possible as for the last hundred or so years . 
   what do you really have to defend ? 
  our country ? 
  our families ? 
  our homes ? 
  our property ? 
  our society ? 
  our civil order ? 
  our worldview ? 
  you could surely find more than enough things worthy of being defended . 
   and what against ? 
  we 'll find out right after we disband our army . 
  if history taught poles a one thing , it 's to always be vary of russia . 
   really `` attacks '' poland wont last more then a day on this planet ... only if they use nukes . 
  which they wo n't , because * even * russia is n't that dumb to use nukes offensively and in a first strike . 
  in a conventional war poland could last against russia for weeks , especially if we were ( eventually ) backed up by our allies . 
   the european people wont let us invest in weapons anymore nah , we learned our lesson in 18th century , when low military spending of the polish state was one of the crucial reasons why it became occuppied and divided between russia , austria and prussia , and ever since we were always spending a lot on military . 
  sometimes it was enough ( 1807-09 , 1919-21 ) , and sometimes the enemy was so powerful , that no ammount of military spending would save us ( 1812-15 , 1939-45 ) , but at least we tried to do our best . 
  we would buy those weapons anyway , even without russia acting threatening again , the only difference being a bit lower priority of transaction , and probably conducting it over a longer period of time . 
   the falsification of the elections and the `` few surviving reports of original results in southern poland '' . 
  http://web.archive.org/web/20150408154348/http://ipn.gov.pl/kalendarium-historyczne/sfalszowane-wybory-19-stycznia-1947-roku/pelna-tresc-artykulu http://www.kedyw.info/wiki/andrzej_paczkowski,_referendum_z_30_czerwca_1946_r._pr%c3%b3ba_wst%c4%99pnego_bilansu [ ( page 30 , paragraph 6 ) ] ( https://www.google.pl/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=3du0vbutdi7bapitgzge&amp;url=http://umcs.net.pl/index.php%3fact%3dattach%26type%3dpost%26id%3d111&amp;ved=0ccmqfjad&amp;usg=afqjcnf_wf1zoroo-baqnhsnytuwrh8a-a )  source to the `` heavy pro-commie propaganda '' and mass political terror and oppression of any opposition for the three years prior to the elections . 
  asking for a source on such well-known historical fact is like asking for a source on someone claiming that `` after the 1933 elections in germany , the nazi party banned all the other parties '' , but here you are : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_poland_ ( 1945 % e2 % 80 % 9389 ) #consolidation _ of_communist_power, 
  sources on which part exactly ? 
  so bad the elections were falsified , and according to the few surviving reports of original results from southern poland , commies were n't even close to winning , let alone having a majority they had according to `` official '' results - and all that despite heavy pro-commie propaganda , mass political terror and opression of any opposition for the three years prior to the elections , while the illegitimate self-proclaimed unelected commie government was already in power . 
  so no , poles did not vote for a communist government in the 40s . 
  and definitely did not vote for a communist government at any point since we regained independence in 1989 . 
  proportionally , turks almost eradicated the armenian nation , while the turkish nation was nowhere close to that state . 
   we suffered faaar more than armenians \\  this is what turks actually believe, 
   1919 in 1919 you could equally easily argue that poland was * attacked * by soviet russia and soviet ukraine . 
  it was a war of independence , and there were n't any defined borders of either country . 
  in contrast , the fact that poland was * attacked * by czechoslovakia that year ( over the exact same area poland took in 1938 ) is an indisputable historical fact . 
   1938 ... a small and narrow * disputed * border strip ( see previous paragraph ) . 
  slovakia took similarly small parts of poland in 1939 , and i am yet to see anyone mentioning it to slovaks implying they should feel terribly guilty about it on every possible occasion . 
   1946 literally the worst crime against jews in history of the world . 
  except , you know , the little known killing of 6 million jews two years earlier by germans . 
   2015 yes , in grand scale we are as good as innocent if those are the worst things you could find . 
   slavic residents of the grand dutchy of lithuania used the word `` litvin '' to identify themselves with . 
  `` litwin/litvin '' * literally * means `` lithuanian '' in polish/old ruthenian . 
  i thought we just had a prusowie ( the original ones ) / prusacy ( german colonists brought by teutonic knights ) distinction ? 
  though the latter are indeed simply called germans more often than not . 
  the modern `` macedonian '' identity was invented after a part of the bulgarian ethnic territory became ruled by serbia , and later yugoslavia - actually in a way that 's quite similar to the creation of the `` moldovan '' nation . 
  and that 's alright , if they do n't want to be bulgarians anymore , forcing them into it wo n't do any good . 
  as those not-anymore-bulgarians were inhabiting the northern part of the region called macedonia , they started to call themselves that way . 
  and that alone would be alright , the problem is that they are also pretending to be direct successors of ancient macedonia , which is obviously false . 
  considering that , i fully support greece on this naming issue . 
  no , it would be better if those people lived in normally planned districts of the city , with a regular road system , and perhaps even some more variance than two different models of a building per town . 
  i 've been living in a commieblock estate for a few years , and i hate everything about it . 
  it 's as if the whole area was intentionally planned to be inefficient , depressing and ugly ( and even the best efforts of the community in repainting the buildings or maintaining the grass , trees and pavements could n't change it ) . 
  yes , we are very poor and literally everyone is starving here , there 's a widespread famine , drought and pestilence , and constant wars beetween various tribes . 
  i 'm writing it from the humanitarian aid pack containing a portion of internet , which is being distributed in our village by the selfless scandinavian missionaires who came from overseas to enlighten us savages ( btw this is the only way to obtain this novelty ` internet ' thing in our fifth world country ) . 
  yeah , that british , danish and swedish pussies , even romania will have euro before them !, 
  sweden does n't have an opt-out , and they manage to avoid euro just fine . 
  it 's hard to believe how much damage ideas of a one man can inflict . 
  the absolutely disastrous design of the peripheral districts of almost every polish city would never happen without le courbusier , and the worst part is that those abominations will remain there for centuries . 
   yet the lithuania did and somehow the apocalypse did not come . 
  lithuanian economy is also the size of a one polish voivodeship , it makes sense for them to enter the currency union they would be pegged to anyway . 
  oh , no doubt it would be welcomed by the rest of eurozone . 
  it would hardly be the case with polish and czech populations though . 
   not sure where it 's possible to have that majestic operation of becoming a `` random lithuanian '' or `` random russian '' . 
  ... did you really just managed to treat this as a plausible situation that could happen to anyone ? 
  though this way you succeeded in completely ignoring the point i was trying to make , clever . 
   but in practice the only real advantage of being a random lithuanian , is the ability to get the fuck out of there in london and that whole `` not living in an authoritarian glorified petrostate , but in a completely normal 1.5 world country '' thing . 
   living standards between russia and lithuania - pffft , mate ... yeah , there 's no comparison indeed - even if you include st. petersburg and moscow that bring the russian average considerably higher , russia still loses to lithuania on every possible metric . 
   even in this case that 's two more than lithuanians . 
  well , you are literally the biggest and one of the most populous countries on earth , that have for centuries profited from conquest and exploitation of all of your neighbours , and despite finally partially collapsing 25 years ago ( to the great happiness of everyone forced to live under your yoke ) you still pretend that you are a relevant great power . 
  in such circumstances , i would n't call the fact that such country have * two * relatively modern cities a considerable success . 
   basically the point of someone up the chain about where it 's better to live is very arguable i have already said that the middle-sized city is more than enough for a capital of the lithuania-sized country . 
  there 's a highest proportion of lithuanias living there , than russians living in st. petersburg/moscow , and average ( or median , i 'd say ) living standard in lithuania is considerably higher than jn russia , so if i had to either become a random lithuanian or random russian , i would definitely chose the first option ( though being a random pole i am still beats the former by a little bit , and the latter by a considerable ammount ) . 
   the difference is that russia has a modern cities two of them , how nice that you used the plural form . 
   lithuanias ... well , they have vilnius . 
  their whole nation is less populous than the warsaw metro area , so it would be weird to expect them to have a big metropolis . 
   about london - well maybe you have a brother there which you wanted to visit . 
  or mom , working as a nanny or something , no ? 
  i literally do n't know anyone from my closest family who would have emigrated . 
  all i recall is some distant aunt in usa , and that 's it . 
  why on earth would i want to have a stopover in london , when there are perfectly fine warsaw-wilno connections within minutes from me ? 
  no wonder russia is such a shithole , if you always do everything in such inefficient manner . 
  ( also , i 've been there already . 
  nice polish-style old town , surrounded by shitty commieblocks built by russians during their occupation ) . 
   's arguable , unless living in a wooden house waking early in the morning to milk your cow is really your thing . 
  wow , so that 's what typical daily life in russia includes . 
  it 's even worse than i thought then , no wonder you guys seem so angry . 
  if you are going to share a flat anyway , i do n't see any reason why would n't you just keep sharing it with your parents ( especially if they happen to live in the same city ) instead of with some random people . 
   much smaller population you are not even twice as big as us .
