  there are six * large * countries in eu , and then there 's a visible gap all the way to romania and netherlands . 
  i do n't like when we do n't make the cut only just because we happen to be the smallest of the six . 
   with one blow , destroy the structures of authority in the country , i would definitely count destroying the structures of authority in the country * with one blow * as an attempt to spread fear . 
  actually , it would be hard to find many things that would be spreading fear * more * . 
  i like how all the countries are neatly sorted except for usa which resides proudly on the top of both charts completely disregarding the sorting . 
  another proof that america is omnirelevant . 
  it 's not like anyone really forces you to have those majority non-turkish and apparently completely impoverished and underdeveloped areas as a part of your country . 
   think things over if you are genuinely upset by national embarrassment . 
  that does n't change the fact that i am genuinely upset about perceiving the 40 years of soviet occupation to be the defining moment of my country by some ignorant foreigners . 
   learn not to care . 
  it 's easy not to care when nobody really looks down on you because of stupid shit like that , and at worst you are `` those guys from some little irrelevant country in western europe '' . 
   since language is the only meaningful barrier remaining in schengen , i think similar language groupings really do present the most meaningful subdivisions of europe possible , although often they conflict with the geographic cardinal identifiers . 
  you have not answered my point at all . 
  both greek or finnish are as different from german or french as polish ( finnish even more , as it 's not even indoeuropean ) . 
  edit :  in my head all the meaningful european subdivisions look like this so czechs managed to escape the `` shithole zone '' despite not speaking a germanic or romance language ( and you consider them more similar to swiss than to slovaks ) ? 
  how comes ? 
   why do you not want to be part of eastern europe ? 
  because we were artifically added to that region after our country got occupied by ussr in 1945 . 
  before that date , nobody ever considered poland to be `` eastern '' . 
  as the period of communist rule is considered illegitimate here , it 's only understandable we want to get rid of all relics of it . 
   do you not want to be associated with other countries perhaps . 
  we definitely do n't want to be associated with countries like russia , which for most of history were like polar opposites of poland . 
   you afraid we will think you are moldova ? 
  from the attitude of the average `` westerner '' towards poland , i 'd say that 's exactly the case . 
  one more reason to hate this idiotic cold war-era relic . 
   i will probably never think of eastern europe starting anywhere else but on the eastern border of germany , thanks stalin . 
   , mainly for language family reasons . 
  i like how noone ever considers finland or greece to be in eastern europe for the exact same reason . 
  as a bonus , both countries lie further east than poland . 
   is this polish geographic obstinacy like argentinians insisting that they are caucasian ? 
  argentinians * are * mostly caucasian though , i never get this joke . 
   democrats are n't even left-wing in poland they would be . 
  though again , in poland republicans would appear as a completely regular party somewhere between the centre and right wing . 
  she also will be 4th with 5 % , at best . 
  somewhere in northeastern poland , lithuania or western belarus , depending on the method of calculation . 
   happens everywhere does it also appear to be forced by quite sizeable proportion of major media ( cough agora cough ) in those countries , despite perfectly accurate native words for all those concepts existing ? 
  because that 's what pisses me off the most about it , aside of how ridiculous `` perform\u0119s '' , `` szopink '' or `` iw\u0119t '' sound in polish . 
  the river had a slightly different shape back when the border was defined . 
  well , if google search counts as an argument now , here is my indisputable [ proof that we are in central europe after all . 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=map+overlapping+eastern+europe&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1ggls_enbe368be368&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=895&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gukuvapwazppaotrgjak&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=map+central+europe ), 
   is pretty obvious that poland is being groomed by washington to be the co-leader of central europe with germany . 
  that 's the plan . 
  we are getting additional perks for something we would do anyway , hard to find a more classic example of win-win relations . 
   is poland becoming/already the leader of eastern europe ? 
  with our `` do n't have any original ideas and follow germany on everything '' policy ? 
  haha . 
  also , \\  eastern europe i wonder when this idiotic cold war-era misconception will finally die . 
  we are in central europe . 
  eastern europe is traditionally orthodox and tends to write in cyrillic alphabet . 
   how do other eastern europeans feel about warsaw being their `` london '' or `` paris '' ? 
  due to being completely destroyed and razed to the ground 71 years ago , warsaw nowadays is way too undersized to even be the capital of the country the size of poland , let alone the regional `` main city '' . 
   follows no , if anything it was south africa that followed the example of poland , seeing as transition there happened 4-5 years later than here . 
  pl-ru-lt is almost a quadpoint , as it 's also the exact spot where the border between warmian-masurian and podlachian voivodships meets the border of poland . 
  the mass murder of jewish poles didnt start until 1942 , and i was strictly comparing the 1939-1941 period , as after that germans were the only occupants of poland left so it 's hard to * compare * anything . 
  also , the topic of our conversation was treatment of the * ethnic * poles . 
  i know that between 1939 and 1941 jewish poles were treated by germans as bad as ethnic poles by soviets ( though , for logistical reasons , the german equivalent of deportations to asia was closing them in ghettos ) . 
  it seems that you russians indeed have a chart with the three possible replies to any post mentioning the soviet atrocities during the ww2 , because your reply is not even remotely relevant to my post . 
   so , by the time of 1920 , part of them were old rzeczpospolita territories as for times of divide , but there were very little poles liviing on them . 
  no , they were n't * majority * , [ and there were indeed sizeable areas where poles were n't the most numerous ethnic group ] ( http://s24.postimg.org/u4d92sedh/polacy_na_kresach.png ) , but still - poles were the single most numerous group on the part of poland occupied by ussr , at 38 % ( compared to ukrainians making up 37 % , belarusians 14.5 % , and jews 8.5 % of population ) . 
  that 's way over 5 million people , and i would n't consider it to be `` very little '' , as there are many european nations far less numerous than that . 
  the number of 1.2 million deported might indeed likely be a bit inflated , because there are no detailed sources , only varying estimates . 
  or perhaps ukrainian and belarusian srrs were formed with claims to the lands of already formed republic of poland ? 
  there are always two sides of the coin . 
   there were no ethnic repressions agains poles . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_%281939%e2%80%9346%29  as the soviet union had not signed international conventions on rules of war , the polish prisoners were denied legal status . 
  the soviet forces murdered almost all captured officers , and sent numerous ordinary soldiers to the soviet gulag  in the two years between the invasion of poland and the 1941 attack on ussr by germany , the soviets arrested and imprisoned about 500,000 poles . 
  the soviet nkvd executed about 65,000 imprisoned poles after kangaroo trials . 
  [ 7 ]  in 1940 and the first half of 1941 , the soviets deported a total of more than ** 1,200,000 ** poles in four waves of mass deportations from the soviet-occupied polish territories . 
  the first major operation took place on february 10 , 1940 , with more than 220,000 people sent to northern european russia . 
  the second wave of 13 april 1940 , consisted of 320,000 people sent primarily to kazakhstan . 
  the third wave of june -- july 1940 totaled more than 240,000 . 
  the fourth and final wave occurred in june 1941 , deporting 300,000 . 
  upon resumption of polish-soviet diplomatic relations in 1941 , it was determined ( based on soviet information ) that more than 760,000 deportees had died  simultaneously soviet authorities tried to remove traces of polish history in the area by eliminating much of what had connections to the polish state or even polish culture in general . 
  [ 10 ] there were * no ethnic repressions * against poles , sure . 
  i would argue that for * ethnic poles * the 1939-41 soviet occupation was even harsher than the german one in the same time period . 
  though germans matched the level of soviets in later parts of the war , when they were the only occupiers left . 
   poland attacked ussr before and killed many russians in a fights and in the labor camps . 
   poland attacked ussr  attacked there was no ussr in 1919 , in the war russians killed many poles as well ( including 20 thousands dead in russian powcamps ) , and it could equally easily be argued that the war was started by soviet russia trying to conquer poland again , right after it regained independence . 
   pillage and destruction of the czechoslovak state ... 
  yes , because taking a ( disputed since the fall of austria-hungary , with this issue never completely resolved ) border strip the size of a large town without any casualities is totally the same as a full blown invasion resulting in occupation of half of the territory , followed by an execution of dozens of thousands pows and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of civilians . 
  i keep wondering whether you had some paradocumentary about it in your national tv lately , because i find it extremely interesting russians are the only ones to bring it up anytime anyone mentions their two orders of magnitude bigger atrocities . 
   for the past 70 years considering we were under your occupation for 45 out of those 70 years , and during that time most of historical research in our country had to be done in secrecy , conspiracy and underground , while officially everyone was being fed blatant lies of soviet propaganda ( that hardly anyone took seriously , sure , but still ) i find it really ironic you are the one to talk about `` rewriting history '' . 
   or was controlling kresy for few years that important for stalin ? 
  i 'd say it was more about having a claim to * keep * kresy after the war ended . 
  a bit , but it 's not really an important point , as both parties are commited to nato and alliance with usa - the former just sees it as secondary to the ties with eu , while the latter is moderately eurosceptic , and considers nato & close ties with us to be the foundation of our foreign policy instead . 
  liberal conservatives ( the ruling party ) tend to be more pro-european than pro-american , and national conservatives ( the opposition ) tend to be more pro-american than pro-european . 
   those who liked the ussr were pretty pissed when they got no help from the ussr during the civil war . 
  ussr troops tend to have a really hard time finding the way out of the country after they already entered it . 
  for example , in poland such feat took them only 49 years . 
   unlikely they would have been part of the warsaw pact maybe , maybe not . 
  we 'll never know . 
   anyway if you are going to spout offensive ignorant shit about britains role in greece , educate yourself please : seems that britons were n't the kindest in greece , its a shame . 
  still - i have read this article , and when compared to the atrocities ussr was commiting in poland in regards to the polish anti-german resistance , home army and the polish underground state it sounds rather mild in comparision . 
   stalin had agreed to keep his hands off hehe . 
  stalin was * so * known to keep his word and be the one you could fully trust . 
   likely it would have been a yugoslavia type situation . 
  or perhaps czechoslovakia-type , or bulgaria . 
  either way , greece nowadays would be even more fucked than it is right now . 
   yeah , lets start giving nazi allies statues . 
  soviet union was also an ally of nazis , closely and keenly cooperating in conquering most of central and eastern europe until they were betrayed by them in 1941 .
