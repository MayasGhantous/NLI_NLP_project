  it so happens that there are also other media in poland than those owned by the government , and by an odd coincidence they are completely unaffected by the reforms inside the government-owned media . 
  is poland 's `` freedom of press '' threatened anytime bauer or agora decide to reform their internal structure as well ? 
  why would n't it be ? 
  each media outlet is free to report with whatever bias it choses . 
   this is the closest they came to decent looking commieblocks it 's also probably the closest they came in europe to realizing le corbusier 's [ infamous paris plan . 
  ] ( https://climaxcity.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/paris-2k-fg-corb.jpg ) [ it used to be an even bigger tragedy ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/8/7874/z7874168x,osiedle-za-zelazna-brama-w-warszawie.jpg ) , fortunately the spaces between the blocks were wide enough that some new buildings were able to fit between them recently . 
  still , even now the [ damage to urban fabric ] ( http://pu.i.wp.pl/bloog/69310256/51240150/2qxs377_bv_big.jpg ) done by z\u017bb is severe and irrevocable . 
  how a little bit of warsaw was rebuilt using 18th century paintings . 
  the rest of the city , instead of being rebuilt , was shat all over with hideous commieblocks . 
   dangerous how ? 
  it 's the first time i see wroclaw being called most dangerous . 
  wroclaw is definitely among [ the most crime-infested cities in poland , ] ( https://www.mojapolis.pl/media/images/2014.jpg ) and it consistently tops the rank of the most [ unsafe cities in poland . 
   that kind of separation makes no sense . 
  between a bulgarian and a portuguese there 's a big difference . 
  there 's a big difference between a pole and albanian as well , yet we get lumped together as `` eastern europe '' all the time . 
   and there are way more many connections between a slovene and a polish than between a polish and a finnish . 
  slovenes and even croats are somewhere in between being `` northern '' and `` southern '' to me . 
   and the irish waaaay more close to the bretons from bretagne than to you guys . 
  bretons from bretagne definitely appear more `` northern '' than `` southern '' to me . 
  but , as with every two-categories classification of europe , this one is clearly imperfect as well . 
  well , you easily could , as you are non-med . 
  i , for one , perceive brits , germans , scandinavians , poles , balts as `` northern europeans '' , and spaniards , italians , greek , south slavs as `` southern europeans '' . 
  though it 's indeed hard to easily place the french as a whole in either of those two groups . 
  and many do think `` non-mediterranean '' . 
  scandinavians do n't have a monopoly on `` looking northern european '' . 
   the polish are actually slavs . 
  slavs do n't really look alike either . 
  they also have the biggest radio ( rmf fm ) , and 2 out of 4 biggest internet portals ( onet and interia ) . 
   3 years well , po only took media over after they won the 2010 presidential elections and could replace the remaining krrit members , so it checks out . 
   honestly , have you seen tvp year ago and now ? 
  i 've seen it a few times both then and now ( though other than some sports events , i rarely watch tv at all ) . 
  anyhow , i recall the incredibly intensive pro-po propaganda in tvp before the elections , even tvn seemed more unbiased in comparison . 
  right now , tvp indeed keeps the title of the most biased out of the three mainstream tv stations , and admitably even managed to strenghten its lead in that regard . 
   they fired the journalists that did relation from anti-pis march . 
  they were ordered to ignore it and show `` preparations to world youth days '' material instead ...  for comparison see the march pis and tv trwam did when po increased retirement age . 
  there were regular transmissions from it . 
  there * were * regular transmissions from anti-pis marches , even if not constant and uninterrupted ones as if it was the only thing happening in the country at the time . 
  they were n't completely ignored despite your claims . 
   [ citation needed ] that 's when , thanks to komorowski 's votes , po finally managed to get a majority in krrit , starting their control over public media which lasted until pis took over lately . 
   than turning public media into govt circlejerk club ? 
  considering that they did n't drop our ranking back in 2011 , when after getting president on their side po took over the public media and turned it into a government circlejerk club , it 's highly unlikely . 
  yes , it seems that everything would be a-ok if only the public media remained a propaganda tube controlled by the old government . 
  guess they finally caught up on police [ raiding the wprost headquaters ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/b9/8f/f7/z16224185v,szarpanina-prewka.jpg ) for publishing materials compromising donald tusk 's government back in 2014 , because i ca n't think of any other serious infringements of press freedom in our country since then . 
   have happened in the absence of the pact ? 
  without the 1934 pact ? 
  most likely yes , as it happened simply because the polish leaders ruling at the time decided this is the perfect moment they 've been waiting for ever since czechoslovakia invaded poland in 1920 - with czechoslovakia being massively weakened by the decision of germany , france , the united kingdom , and italy in munich just few days earlier , as well as the hungarian government issuing its own demands . 
   i think the polish leaders at the time would have been vary wary of proceeding with it . 
  that probably depends on how exactly the german foreign policy towards poland would look like in such an alternate timeline , but unless it was incredibly antagonistic and aggressive ( which is n't likely , as germany still tended to focus on one target back then ) , i do n't see then-polish government not proceeding with zaolzie operation in case of anything weakening czechoslovakia to the extent resembling the munich agreement . 
   no , that 's not the reason . 
  quite the contrary , that 's * precisely * the reason . 
  the streets on the outskirts were mostly planned for the open towers-in-the-woods commieblock design , and that 's where it might have somewhat worked , but it was n't a very versatile design , as the return of the normal real estate market and private ownership of land shows . 
   even in commie districts with commieblocks and sparse street network you can still walk freely if there 's no fences . 
  no , * even * is a wrong word here . 
  quite the contrary , that 's the entire point of commieblock districts - the only reason one can walk freely and there are no fences there is because they * were n't * envisioned as a private property , and the lots they were built on were communal . 
  which is a flawed premise , as until then the cities were planned in a way that the primary places where people * walked freely * were streets , as one can clearly see to this day in the centre of [ \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ] ( https://d-pt.ppstatic.pl/k/r/15/8c/79/4fa154af6e300_p.jpg?1400632817 ) , or perhaps in [ pre-war warsaw ] ( http://p4.wawalove.pl/p4.wawalove.pl/8bc4fc81debbd136c28177b3efa79c3c.jpg ) . 
  the new districts are simply a result of a return to the pre-war philosophy of building on private lots , but with the * architecture itself * resembling more the post-war commieblocks , and the natural end result of it is large swathes of cities being enclosed by fenced lawns with buildings here and there , rather than just densely packed buildings . 
   what i find interesting is that both poland and the ussr used pacts with nazi germany for revanchist purposes . 
  no , the entire point is that poland * did not * use the pact with germany for revanchist purposes . 
  there was n't a word regarding czechoslovakia in the 1934 pact , in fact there were no prior consultations or agreements with germany regarding the 1938 polish ( re ) taking over of zaolzie , we did it entirely on our own . 
   anyway , you really think that your country could handle the german occupation by itself ? 
  yeah , would germans handle occupation of poland by themselves ? 
  soviet contribution to mass murder of poles in 1939-1941 period was indeed very spectacular , i 'd say even more so than the german one in analogous period ( though later on germans increased their efforts and managed to catch up to the soviet level ) . 
  the pact between nazi germany and soviet union happened to include a secret protocol , which outlined the division of multiple sovereign european nations between those two countries and was pretty much an equivalent of an alliance . 
  on the other hand , the polish-german pact from 1934 , or the polish-soviet pact from 1932 happened not to include one . 
  nah , it 's only as necessary as specyfying that it were warsaw 's jews who have risen in this particular uprising . 
  i mean , we could have a title like `` some time ago some guys rose up in some city against some other guys '' , but it would n't make for a very informative post now , do n't you think ? 
  interestingly enough , the name `` z\u0142oty '' means `` golden '' , just like in the case of the pre-euro dutch currency . 
   backyards of tenament houses are still public space sometimes they are , sometimes they are n't . 
  though they indeed tend to be open in more touristy areas . 
   it makes a huge difference , whether the building is behind a fence , or right next to a street/pavement - you ca n't walk through a city , when there 's a fence every few buildings . 
  the actual difference between both situations is that the street grid tends to be much more dense in the parts of the city where the old style of buildings is prevalent . 
  after all , you ca n't walk through buildings just like you ca n't walk through fences , it 's just that in the center you only need to walk for 50 or so meters before you can turn into another street , while in the newer districts the distance migh well enough be a few times longer . 
  well , that and the fact that buildings adjacent to streets tend to be multi-use and have various businesses operating on their first floor , which makes things much more interesting . 
   i much prefer the old style urban planning . 
  so do i , streets with buildings that are sharing their side walls are much more city-like than the ones with free-standing buildings . 
  i blame idiotic commie planning for making the latter style more popular in our cities . 
   heck , last year there an epidemic of people gatting themselves on the beaches well , people were [ doing this on the beaches ] ( http://www.leba.net/0z/2005/2018x.jpg ) for as long as i can remember ( personally , i 've always took at least two windscreens just to be enclosed better ) , perhaps the last year someone finally found out that it might not really be as prevalent abroad , and thus it became a talking point in an otherwise uneventful summer season . 
  in older parts of cities , like for example in old town krak\u00f3w , the building tends to take up the * entire * lot ( mind how it 's most often right besides the street ) , and what 's inside the building by definition is an enclosed ( one could say `` gated '' ) space . 
  [ for illustration . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/brama_kamienicy_przy_ruskiej_51_fot_bmaliszewska.jpg ) nowadays the most common style changed , and the buildings tend to take up only a portion of a lot , while the rest needs to be enclosed with a fence , thus creating a `` gated community '' . 
  [ this version looks quite familiar , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/sandvig_-_front_gardens.jpg ) other ones seem like something from foreign movies though . 
  and why do people have fences around their houses ? 
  it 's a privately-owned propety , strangers have no business walking around there . 
  my home is my castle , and all . 
  not really , enclosing privately owned plots of land with a fence is simply how the things were always done here , and there is no reason * not to * do so . 
  indeed , the biggest difference here is russia having lots and lots of nukes . 
  and the thing with nukes is , that a club of few cool countries ( which happens to include russia ) is allowed to have a big arsenal of them , while the rest of us mortals has to either befriend someone from the cool countries club ( like we did with uncle america ) , or try to develop them anyway , ending up with heavy sanctions , crippled economy and international ostracism . 
   germany is blocking us presence in poland ? 
  how that . 
  are we going to invade the us when they do n't do as we say ? 
  on every single occasion the topic of nato bases in poland arisen , germany always loudly proclaimed that they are against it . 
  whether it had any influence on us actions , i wo n't try to guess , but it definitely leaves a bitter impression of germany . 
   poland should be grateful that is has been incorporated into the nato in the first place oh , we very much are . 
  definitely the best choice we did in the last two decades . 
   if you ask me , it is not in the position for demands . 
  we are as much a member as any other one , thus we are as much in position for demands as any other member . 
   same goes for it 's eu membership . 
  same as in paragraph above . 
   in poland it seems to be a common point of view that the rest of the world is totally dependent to poland . 
  and outside of poland it seems to be a common point of view that those silly second-class humans poles should quietly obey everything they are told by * actual * countries , regardless of whether we agree with it or not .
