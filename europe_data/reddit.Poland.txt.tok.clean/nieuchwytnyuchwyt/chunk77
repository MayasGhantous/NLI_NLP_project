  not at all , poland as a country is a nation of those who * stayed at home * . 
  you might be confused with polish diaspora . 
  one does not become the most powerful and influential politician in a country by being an idiot . 
   what about the 3448 poles that requested asylum in germany in 1991 ? 
  or the 4212 that requested asylum in 1992 ? 
  or the 1670 in 1993 ? 
  i hope they were all told to go fuck themselves , because that was the only reasonable reaction to their request . 
  well , iran * was * the first safe country for them , as they came from soviet union . 
  harsh for latvia indeed . 
  the state-owned provider of mandatory social insurance will collapse spectacularly long before our retirement anyway , and if you want to receive medical treatment in a reasonable timeframe , your best option is a private hospital , thus most people are essentially paying twice for their healthcare . 
  watching how bad our team got this year was almost painful . 
  perhaps with kruczek gone now we 'll be back in the lead next season . 
  anyhow , congrats for pero , he was really unlucky last year by losing the world cup by 0 points , and beating allmost all possible world cup records this season ( other than some exotic ones like the percentage of wins in a season , ma\u0142ysz 's 2000/2001 remains unbeaten here ) is an amazing feat . 
   we 're on top of you , maybe from your point of view . 
  [ from * our * perspective , you surely look like one of those bunch of countries to the east of us . 
  ] ( http://www.geografia24.eu/geo120_mapa_polski/2003/org/pl_administracyjna_kolor.jpg ) the fact that you are between russia and belarus certainly do n't help that either . 
  we had higher gdp per capita than you both in the 90s , and after 2008 . 
  no , going by the current polls over twice the support of the second party , and getting more than half of the seats in parliament would be a landslide - and the fact that half of the electorate do n't even bother to vote is irrelevant to it being a landslide electoral victory . 
  on the contrary really , as for many months before the election it was ( and still is ) completely obvious which party is on the lead right now , and by * not voting * they only demonstrate that they clearly have nothing in particular * against * them ruling . 
  as for the `` 19 % '' meme - it 's not like it 's fundamentally different from barrack `` 28 % '' obama , david `` 24 % '' cameron or angela `` 23 % '' merkel . 
   serious question , is there a possibility for a vote of no confidence in government in polish law ? 
  there is such possibility - but only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor . 
  the parliament can also vote to shorten its term . 
  either way , considering that the ruling party has a stable majority in parliament , both options would seem purely theoretical . 
  in fact , it would n't benefit the opposition even if it somehow happened , as according to the polls if an early election were called right now , the current ruling party would win by an even bigger landslide than it did back in october . 
   en '' \u0119 '' is not `` en '' , we distinguish between those two in both orthography and pronunciation . 
  polish already is instantly perfectly readable , no ambiguity , in the script we 've been using since we started to write down our language . 
  `` because my religion of progressivism says so '' is not an argument to begin with either . 
  and i am yet to see any other arguments in favour . 
  yet that 's all you did in the thread leading to this post . 
  i think you are under some wrongful assumption that the post-1968 new left values somehow have a monopoly on using the name `` european \u2122 '' . 
  `` there are no arguments for x , and an argument y against x does n't count as an argument '' . 
  great template , very useful for easily dismissing absolutely everything . 
  bonus feature : works exactly as good for both sides of the argument . 
   there are more and better arguments for one side than the other though . 
  that 's what anyone would say about * his own * values as well . 
   obama was supported by 61 % of the voters . 
  out of 558 people who actually , you know , vote in the us . 
  believe or not , but the members of the electoral college are also being chosen in elections . 
  countrywide , only 28 % of american voters voted for the electors supporting obama . 
  anyhow , your post was a prime / r/iamverysmart material , mate . 
   why do you compare the weird electoral college system truth be told , i did n't - usa was simply the first country i thought of back when i was writing that post . 
  my point was - countries ruled by parties supported by majority of * eligible * voters are extremely uncommon - in fact such situation is practically impossible unless it 's a country ruled by a very broad coallition , or with a very high turnout . 
   but of course it 's the `` lefty media '' who are manipulating . 
  the strawman you attempt to fight here is so big , it would be visible from the moon with the naked eye . 
   why would poland allow it ? 
  the government ruling at the time got so used to bending over to everyone , they did so out of habit in this case as well . 
  i simply do n't see any point in bringing up `` le 19 % ackchually '' every time this is discussed . 
  it 's a completely random and irrelevant trivia - i mean , have you ever seen anyone claiming that `` but only 28 % of american voters supported him guys ! '', 
  under an article about something obama says ? 
  nobody else does that , yet for some reason one seemingly ca n't have a post about poland here without obligatory mention of this meme . 
   laughable ? 
  hmmm laughable because you say so yes , laughable . 
  continuing the same way of thinking , one could argue that `` why bother about constitution , after all only 22 % of voters voted for it '' . 
  and even our eu accession was supported by mere 44 % of voters , why should their will prevail over the remaining 56 % ? 
   but only 17 % of voters i could have sworn this percentage is getting smaller and smaller each time i see this argumentation . 
   it 's not like the eu pays alot of money to east europe and the economy is growing in the east . 
  the economy was growing before we joined the eu as well . 
  actually , one could argue it even was growing [ faster ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/i/n/201312/ftddgix8ited_1c8e7608.png ) back then . 
  not at all . 
   i do n't think you understand how the pension system works . 
  no , i am quite sure it is you who do n't understand it . 
  in current form it 's pretty much a ponzi scheme however one looks at it , and the only way to keep it from imminent collapse in the future will be massive transfers from the central budget . 
   was commonwealth a democracy ? 
  perhaps in some very broad sense of this word , as the public rights were not universal . 
  noble republic ( `` our state is a republic under the presidency of the king '' ) would be a more suitable term . 
  i was discussing this in context of this  ( see that i do n't say country as most of the time they were part of a larger empire ) untrue claim , and not whether or not there was a `` democracy '' , and for how long . 
  we do n't ? 
   we have been peaceful neighbors for seventy years and they are our greatest economic and cultural ( oui oui oui , we have a public french-german tv channel ! ), 
  partner . 
  that 's only because you * won * - as in the end it is france to whom alsace belongs . 
  meanwhile , germany got so btfo by the rest of the world , that they kinda gave up on everything as they had no other option anyway . 
   they gained their independence from russia . 
  we actually regained our independence from * germany and austria * , and from that established base we expanded on russian-held areas of poland as well . 
   y as most of the time they were part of a larger empire well , out of all the `` time we were part of a larger empire '' , most of it was * our own * empire ( namely commonwealth ) , so we got that going for us . 
  that 's very intetesting , because support for . n in polls * peaked * in late december , and is slowly declining ever since . 
  [ check it out . 
  not really , because the action of `` ordering the arrest of the government '' is simply not among the possible actions this particular court is eligible to make . 
  it would be regarded as legally void at best , and as a coup attempt at worst . 
   president should have the power to dissolve parliament only under certain conditions , none of which are present right now . 
   i suppose the court could order the arrest of the government the court would openly exceed its competence this way , which would be a * valid * reason for the government to accuse it of a coup attempt . 
   pis actually hires people to spam comments on polish sites \\  implying they are the only ones to do so, 
   4 out of 6 polling companies show a drop , with the `` average of recent polls '' being 4 % lower than the october election results . 
  yes , as i have already wrote they indeed show a drop - a drop back in * november * . 
  ever since then , their polling * was * steady - more so , according to averages of several polling companies they even `` regained '' some support by now . 
   are you willing to bet it wo n't decline further , especially given their economic and fiscal policies ? 
  if despite all the negative propaganda efforts during the last few months someone kept supporting pis until * now * , even if at some point in the future he ultimately ceased to support them , it 's extremely unlikely that it would result in shifting this support to either . n or po afterwards - parties like korwin or kukiz would be much more likely to gain voters this way . 
   in fact , it 's already happening as most polls indicate . 
  [ not really , you can check the trends here . 
  ] ( http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/ ) a slight drop in november aside , support of pis remains relatively stable , while the support for opposition declines slowly - . n peaked around the end of december , while po continues downward spiral ever since they lost the presidential election last spring . 
   i was n't actually a big pis supporter . 
  i just regarded them to be the lesser evil compared to po in the last elections . 
   but the constant shittalking from german and eu politicians made me actually defend pis . 
  same for me . 
  you are right , everyone not outraged theatrically by even the most mundane things the government does gets downvoted to oblivion on / r/polska . 
   i would n't be surprised if somewhere along the way they will find a bullshit way to reconcile with both pis electorate and kaczy\u0144ski himself having a genuine and , at least in kaczy\u0144ski 's case , personal hatred of russia ? 
  i would n't bet my money on it . 
   polish-lithuanian commonwealth was n't really a significant military power it was , until mid 17th century . 
   the young , ambitious , intelligent people have gone all over europe , and the ones left are voting in the current regime ? 
  actually , the polish emigrants across the eu voted last year [ overwhelmingly in favour of the current pis government , or even more right-wing parties like kukiz '15 or korwin .
