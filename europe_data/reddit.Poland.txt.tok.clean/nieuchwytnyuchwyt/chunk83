  hence , many people dislike belka as well , if only because of his association with sld . 
   what 's the deal ? 
  the fact that his government was supported by sld . 
   eu to shift refugee burden to northern states good thing we are * eastern * then , as i 've been told multiple times in here . 
  seems that we really dodged a bullet . 
   lel , i think you need to look up what a circle jerk is . 
  an anti-pis circlejerk is what you wish this thread was , absence of which visibly disappointed you . 
  i know very well what a `` circlejerk '' is , i frequent a broad array of them . 
   that 's somehow even worse than the last one . 
  i 'd say it 's actually much better , but to each their own . 
   the undemocratic changes concern the quality of law , not the process . 
  you are not even writing coherent sentences anymore . 
  how on earth `` quality of law '' can be `` democratic '' , i have no idea . 
  and i read wyborcza daily to keep track of what am i supposed to think . 
   so we should just turn a blind eye on this forever ?!, 
  frankly , i do n't care . 
  if i was the one to decide i 'd privatize the state owned media altogether , but until it happens i am perfectly okay with them being a propaganda tube of whatever government is currently in power . 
  that 's the way it is . 
  and , while you are not wrong , mind that the other rating agencies did not consider those concerns important enough to warrant dropping poland 's rating from a 's . 
   man , this thread is one giant right wing circlejerk luckily , we 'll now have you , bringing your left wing circlejerk to the rescue . 
  as if echo chamber on / r/polska was n't enough . 
   again with the `` they did it too so it ok '' argument . 
  no , it 's `` they did it too , so it 's clearly not bad enough to warrant such reaction '' argument . 
   the govt was chosen democratically but their actions are anything but their actions are all according to majority voting , that sounds quite * democratic * if you asked me . 
  perhaps you might have wanted to use some other word here . 
   except if they happen to watch public tv well , if they 've been watching public tv for the few last electoral cycles , they would n't notice anything * abnormal * happening this time . 
   hope the country wo n't be a financial wreck after a few years of shitty bills passed without any objections we 'll see about that . 
   i 'm not sure why they even let him on this debate because , as a democratically elected representative , he has equally as much right to present his view in this debate as any other member of european parliament . 
  ease up on your totalitarian views . 
  i am not really convinced by his arguments and i think he 's overreacting , but it still was objectively better than most of other critical voices if only because it actually seemed to be based on at least minimal amount of research . 
  yeah , after watching this debate i have the same opinion . 
  the amount of basic ignorance and misinformation shown by most critics of polish government in this debate was simply ridiculous . 
   then go out and vote for somebody who deserves it !, 
  well , it 's not like it would help in regards to * meps from foreign countries * , would n't it ? 
   like mandatory lustration and what exactly is wrong with that ? 
  the only problem with mandatory lustration is that it was n't already implemented in 1990 . 
  because it shows that he protests simply because he do not like * this particular * party , while he coul n't care less about the * actions * he is supposedly protesting ? 
   republic is a successor to grand duchy ... according to lithuanian-speaking part of population of former grand duchy . 
  interestingly enough , belarusian-speaking and polish-speaking population of it was n't as convinced about it as you were . 
  to be frank , most of them did n't want to have anything to do with your little , chauvinist , nationalistic project called `` republic of lithuania '' . 
  no , it was local polish militia only in early 1919 , after that the lit-bel soviet republic took the city over from this militia , and then in april 1919 the regular polish army and regular polish administration entered the city . 
  at that point the * republic of lithuania * controlled the city for 2 months in its history , in comparison to that over a year of polish control seems like ages . 
  kind of , the `` new '' dialects exist due to fact that those areas were mostly settled after the ww2 by settlers speaking various dialects of polish . 
  by now it 's mostly a codename for official/regular/tv polish . 
   and you must be joking about the 20th century , the polish were relentless with their polonization efforts in the inter-war period as i said , polonization efforts were quite intensive in the interwar period , but they did n't make much difference as the population was already mostly polish . 
  look at the data [ from german census in 1916 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/mapa_rozsiedlenia_ludno%c5%9bci_polskiej_z_uwzgl%c4%99dnieniem_spis%c3%b3w_z_1916_roku.jpg ) , before any systematic polonization efforts could possibly take place . 
   which actually led to polish annexation of vilnius not really , the polish annexation of the city was a direct result of polish-bolshevik war . 
  poland controlled the city since the german ober-ost command left in early 1919 until summer of 1920 , when after the soviet offensive we lost it . 
  meanwhile soviets signed a treaty with lithuania in which they gave them the city , and after the polish counteroffensive in autumn 1920 we suddenly found the city in the hands of third party - lithuania . 
  though indeed , signing a border treaty with you and at the same time sending a `` renegade '' army to reconquer areas lost to bolsheviks and - through them - to lithuania , definitely was n't among the most honorable ways to resolve this situation . 
   apparently conquering lands and expanding influence is n't considered as power what did you conquer ? 
  divided remnants of kievan rus completely devastated by mongols . 
  congratulations , incredible stunt . 
   while being a dwarf with mythical wealth ( medieval switzerland ? ), 
  and population so cramped up in it 's borders , that no other european state had at that time , is . 
  teutonic knights were tiny on map when compared to you , but they were powerful enough that if not for joint polish-lithuanian effort , they would definitely conquer you and you would share the sad fate of prussians . 
  compared to lithuania , poland was a regular european medieval monarchy back then . 
  not really in the league of france or hre , but comparable with scandinavia or hungary . 
   what actually is the cultural/historical heart of poland ? 
  there are two `` hearts '' of poland , and you already included both of them in your post . 
  the early polish state was centered in greater poland region at first ( with gniezno and pozna\u0144 as administrative centers ) , but after it was devastated by czech invasions in the middle of 11th century , the capital was moved to the lesser poland region , which remained the political center of poland for the next few centuries . 
  that 's also why the capital city of krak\u00f3w is by far the best tourist attraction in poland , and has the most impressive royal residence . 
   but i kind of assumed warsaw was always the heart of polish culture/trade/administration / politics absolutely not , warsaw was a little unimportant town somewhere on outskirts for most of polish history , and only after the polish-lithuanian union it started to gain prominence , as the place roughly halfway between polish and lithuanian capitals . 
  due to such central location , it eventually became the usual place of meetings of sejm ( parliament ) , as well as royal elections . 
  it was only in 1596 when king sigigmund iii vasa moved the capital to warsaw , because he did n't want to constantly travel all the way from krak\u00f3w for sejm meetings , as well as he claimed the swedish throne and wanted to be closer to sweden . 
   modern world = / = medieval one because apparently in the medieval era the only thing that counted was sheer land size , while things like population density , wealth or economy were irrelevant . 
  it gets better and better with your every post . 
   wow , so influential , much strong : wow , you were bigger on map : ddd i guess that 's why kazakhstan , mongolia and democratic republic of congo are international powerhouses , while little and irrelevant likes of united kingdom , japan or germany have to sit quietly and wait for what those big powers to decide . 
   biggest historical lie ever because you said so apparently . 
  it actually was lithuania which was the medieval europe 's center of culture , customs and literature , and it was through poland they influenced the rest of europe . 
  like , totally . 
  lithuanian nationalists on reddit are usually ridiculous , and it 's hard to beat the claims they often spout , but this is my new favourite post . 
   created by polish chauvinists in 20th century , repeated by modern neo-nazis . 
  yes , the european history was created by polish chauvinists ( notable for being one of the three most influential groups in the world , along with zionists and the illuminati ) in the 20th century . 
   at the beginning of the union , both poland and lithuania stood on equal grounds . 
  the grounds never were * equal * , poland was way more developed , way stronger economically and way more influential than lithuania . 
   the only thing that was to be assimilated was the christian religion ... as well as the european customs , culture , science , etc. 
  all of which happened to come to lithuania through poland . 
   the transition to polish culture was happening because there were very heavy incentives to do so . 
  of course , the polish culture as the culture of the ruling class of the country was by far the most attractive , that 's why nobles from other cultures , and even peasants assimilated to it in great numbers . 
  that 's it , there was no elusive master plan to devoid anyone of their culture by force like in , say , interwar lithuania towards its polish population . 
   and in 20th century , both polonization and lithuanization was very forceful and very deliberate by 20th century on polish side there was no * need * for forceful and deliberate polonization , as the region was long majority-polish , while lithuanians were a small and insignificant minority , far less numerous than jews or even belarusians . 
  despite that , there still were some polonization attempts ( likely as a reaction to what was happening in the republic of lithuania ) , which is quite a shame , but their effect was minuscule . 
  it must be magic , not polonisation , how the 600 + year old lithuanian capital and the surrounding area became polish in the first place . 
  oh , it 's sadly much more anticlimactic than magic . 
  the local population along with almost entire lithuanian ruling class simply assimilated to the polish culture on their own throughout hundreds of years of polish-lithuanian union . 
  i guess you could indeed call it `` polonization '' , though it was neither deliberate , forceful nor a purposeful process . 
  [ greater poland is marked blue on this map , ] ( http://images.slideplayer.pl/1/428239/slides/slide_5.jpg ) it 's a historical region of poland . 
  we also have a region called `` lesser poland '' . 
   footage of texans praying for rain we did it too . 
  in our [ parliament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbt21orgne ) . 
  not as much as [ lithuanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanization ) though , which unlike polonization actually * had a real impact * on ethnic composition of this area . 
  not anymore , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has depopulated quite significantly ever since the fall of textile industry in the city , while krak\u00f3w managed to actually grow a little in similar timeframe , overtaking it . 
  yeah , i 'd say all four sound like russian , just with non-slavic words . 
  actually , nowadays it 's [ only the countryside around the city where `` j\u0119zyk polski '' is still a majority spoken dialect ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ) , in the city itself it was sadly outnumbered by some immigrant language by now . 
  it 's where we moved lw\u00f3w to . 
  well , that 's precisely the reason why romanian internet infrastructure is so good - extreme deregulation and capitalist free market competition . 
  kazimierz is surely nice but , having been to krak\u00f3w many times , i would n't say it 's the city 's * main * attraction as it was implied in the article . 
  more like swedish and german . 
  mostly in historical context though , most notably when talking about the republic of united provinces .
