   there are absolutely massive fields of wind generators right at the german-polish border there are absolutely massive fields of wind generators in poland as well . 
  does n't mean it 's either profitable , efficient or viable , if not for absolutely massive government and eu donations nobody in their right mind would bother with that . 
   same goes for solar power . 
  precisely , same goes for solar power . 
  yes actually , it would seem so : [ wind ] ( http://www.green-x.at/rs-potdb/4-2.jpg ) , [ solar ] ( http://www.focussolar.de/images/solarmaps/country/europe/2007_europe.png ) , [ hydro ] ( http://pomocedydaktyczne.info/images/nowaera/polska._uksztaltowanie_powierzchnikrajobrazy.jpg ) . 
   basically everything can be simplified as government middle man . 
  and in some cases , for example this particular one , such simplification is a quite good approximation of truth . 
  in the earlier system it * de facto * still was the ruling party who was the one to select the head of public tv , they just did it through krrit - just like americans do not elect their president directly , but through the electoral college . 
  glad to see someone finally treated citizens honestly , and got rid of this theatrics , smoke and mirrors . 
  ... and krrit was selected by the parliamentary majority and president , so the end effect was n't any different than right now , only the middleman was removed . 
   renewables are not a polish value ? 
  no , renewables are not viable as a * main * power source for poland . 
  we are too flat for hydro energy , not windy enough for wind energy , as well as too cloudy and too far north for solar power . 
  we should certainly start replacing coal power with nuclear one though . 
   they are changing the law in a way that turns public tv into pistv . 
  in a way that turns potv into pistv . 
   the `` brief stagnation '' of polish economy surely is connected to the early 2000 's recession in eu and us is it not ? 
  it somewhat is . 
  it also coincides with the time we replaced our [ almost-libertarian business activity law from 1988 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ustawa_wilczka ) with the one more compilant with `` eu standards '' ( and way less business-friendly ) . 
   , pre-eu entry reforms bringing stability and development the late 80s and early 90s reforms were done by us because we deemed them the correct things to do that will help us rebuild the country from commie-induced ruin , not because they were somehow `` eu required '' . 
  no , poland simply implemented a `` shock therapy '' doctrine and fully transitioned into neoliberal market economy within the 1988-1991 period , while ukraine did n't even * start * any serious economical reforms until around 1994 . 
  that 's what the initial difference between poland and ukraine stems from . 
  implementation of eu standards a few years before the eu accession actually coincides with brief stagnation in poland observed in the same period . 
   warsaw-berlin-paris cooperation [ haha . 
  ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=ect-kgxbb4m ) perhaps if your definition of `` cooperation '' is `` obediently do everything we big bosses tell you to , silly poland , and in exchange we 'll still screw you over whenever it 's even remotely profitable for us '' . 
  poland was already [ a few times richer than ukraine back in 2004 .

  hopefuly . 
   as all respected historians [ citation needed ]  anyone with even the most basic understanding of parliamentary systems should know . 
  anyone with even the most basic understanding of parliamentary system should know that it was a prolonged stalemate where all attempts to form a stable government without nazis were proven impossible , thus ultimately ending with nazi * victory * . 
   but since not even a wp article that specifically addresses an wp article that faced such criticism for failing to address the point that they had to add disclaimer at the bottom that they are not entirely correct . 
   not that i care too much anyway i do n't care either , live in your fairy tale world all you want . 
   where did i claim that ? 
  `` no , no , nazis totally did n't * win * the election , they only repeatedly came first with a huge lead , those are totally two different things '' . 
   for the rest : not worth replying too . 
  i found your full of historical revisionism and whitewashing posts not worth replying as well , but i still bothered to . 
   there is no credible historian who claims that the nazis got elected into power , i do not claim they got * elected * into power . 
  i claim that repeteadly winning the elections by a marign making it impossible to form a government without them allowed them to ultimately take the power . 
   there are many example of elections where the largest party by far ended up in the opposition because some other party managed to form a coalition . 
  this is called `` losing '' an election . 
  this is called `` losing '' an election . 
  there are indeed many examples of such situations . 
  unfortunately for your feel good bullshit , 1932-33 germany is * not * among them . 
   this what they teach in polish schools ? 
  god help us all . 
  compares to what that they teach in german schools ? 
  well , explains the `` nazis came from the planet nazi and forced the poor poor germans into becoming their drones through magic and mind-control '' attitude i 'm seeing in you and your compatriots . 
  nothing strange about that , you have to cope with your history somehow , and what method is more effective than denial ? 
   ined power within the democratic system , but that is something else entirely . 
  it 's not something else entirely . 
   to quote the wp : to quote the vox debating this wp article :  hitler would n't have come to power absent the nazis winning a plurality of seats in 1932 . 
  hindenburg was loath to hand over the chancellorship to hitler ; it was his refusal to accept a nazi-led government that forced a snap election in november right after one in july . 
  and even then , hindenburg held out for months . 
  only when it became clear that a right-wing government led by someone other than hitler was completely untenable , given the makeup of parliament , did hindenburg let hitler accede to the chancellorship in january 1933 . 
   we can argue all day about the relative power of the reichspresident versus the reichskanzler , but no one in their right mind would argue that hitler could 've risen to power if the nazis had n't won the 1932 parliamentary elections . 
   just the new government . 
  i am not `` the new government '' , and i do n't accept it as well . 
  i wonder what the results of a poll on this topic would look like . 
   how often do you have to repeat this nonsense ? 
  as often as you 'll keep repeating your whitewashing nonsense . 
   this is n't a race and the weimar republic was n't a winner-takes-all-system . 
  mind the use of * winner * in this expression . 
  no , it was n't a * winner * - takes-it-all , but there still was a * winner * . 
   you can very well have the largest share and still be an opposition party . 
  you * could * . 
  but it 's not what happened in this particular case . 
   seem you get a few very basic things fundamentally wrong . 
  same about you . 
   read this to get a basic understanding of how hitler gained power : i 've read this article . 
  there was nothing in there i was n't already aware of , as well as nothing disproving what i said in this thread . 
  it 's even regarded in `` update '' part of this article , added after its untrue thesis was ( rightfuly ) criticized . 
  nsdap * won * by having a good enough result that no government was possible without them , and they took advantage of it fully within the letter ( though perhaps not the spirit ) of the german constitution . 
  you ca n't deny it no matter what sophismata you use . 
   really wonder how you can write such obvious nonsense with a straight face . 
  i 'm wondering the same about you and this desperate denial flowing from your posts . 
   that 's not winning an election . 
  coming first in means that you have won . 
   party `` wins '' an election when it is able to take power - either directly because it got an absolute majority , or indirectly through a coalition . 
  which nsdap managed to do - they took power during the * democratically elected * november 1932-march 1933 term , taking advantages of weaknesses of weimar constitution . 
  the weaknesses they would be * unable * to take advantage of , had they not * won * the democratic elections prior to that . 
   there were n't `` earlier '' elections , there were new election because the original results did n't result in a workable government . 
  the new elections after the term was shortened due to * winning * party being unable to form coallition with anyone , and other parties being unable to form a coallition without the winning party . 
  i believe the english term for such kind of elections is `` snap elections '' , we simply call it `` hastened/earlier elections '' in polish so i 'm sory for mistranslation . 
   that 's a serious whitewashing of history . 
  half of the main opposition parties were or had been in concentration camps by that time . 
  well , that 's still better than `` elections '' in eastern bloc . 
  on a scale from 1 to 10 i 'd call it a 2-3 . 
  i do n't think so , as nothing significant changed in regards to polish media in comparison to when this chart was made . 
  we managed to achieve this pretty white shade with blatantly pro-government state-owned media back then , and considering that we still have pro-government state-owned media right now our rank should remain unaffected . 
   great mentality to have it 's a mentality shown by * every * government in polish history so far , do n't tell me you * actually * expected it to abruptly end in this particular moment for whatever reason ? 
  the point is - despite some melodrama being spread here and there , the fact is that pro-po bias in public media was , as expected , replaced by pro-pis bias . 
  that 's it . 
  like what steps exactly ? 
  because so far , nothing has changed in regards to media in poland - state-owned media remain government-biased , and private-owned media remain biased in whatever way they wish to be biased . 
   they got the largest share of the vote commonly known as `` winning an election '' . 
   none of these elections did this lead to a majority that would let them rule . 
  in * all * of these elections the result they achieved resulted in them being by far the biggest party , big enough that it was impossible to create a stable parliamentary majority without them . 
  nsdap ** won ** both 1932 elections however you spin it , the best proof of that being that all attempts to create a government without nsdap were fruitless and resulted in earlier elections . 
   1933 `` election '' was an election in name only . 
  the 2nd 1933 election - obviously .
