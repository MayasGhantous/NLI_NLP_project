  the first 1933 election - all the biggest opposition parties * took part * in it , even though they were heavily repressed during the campaign . 
  it certainly was n't a fully democratic , free and fair election , but not to the extent of complete shitshow like later `` elections '' in nazi germany or `` elections '' in soviet-occupied europe until 1989, 
   the nsdap never won a free election . 
  except they * won * free elections . 
  two of them to be precise , and arguably even three ( though the march 1933 one indeed already had many incidents that would dispute `` fairness '' of this election ) . 
  exhibit one - [ july 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_july_1932 ) exhibit two - [ november 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_november_1932 ) exhibit three ( up to discussion ) - [ march 1933 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_march_1933 ), 
  they operate like that because many pis mps are busy working in the government during the day . 
  on the other hand , opposition mps are availible all day long , so pis schedules important votings to evenings and nights in order to avoid being outvoted on the off-chance . 
  yes , the word `` marshal '' is used both in a military way , to mean the highest military rank , as well as to describe the head/speaker of the parliament . 
  there are no immediate military connotations to the latter though . 
  polish parliamentary terminology [ mostly stems from pre-1795 poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marsza%c5%82ek ) , and this is one of the examples where it 's visible . 
   most people in the west when speaking about democracy understand it the way i do , not you . 
  seems that most people in the west are using mental shortcuts when speaking about democracy then . 
   you have putins definition no , i have the basic definition . 
  it 's your definition which is oddly specific and includes much more than the essence of the term , not mine . 
   the west , pretty much everyone sees democracy also including protection of minority , human rights , free opposition , freedom of speech and freedom of press . 
  there you have it - a specific form of democracy . 
  let 's call it , say , * western * democracy , or * liberal * democracy , or whatever other adjective you like . 
   i 'd add that your definition of democracy also includes hitlers germany , where elections supported a massmurderer i 'm glad it includes it , because nsdap * was * democratically elected in 1933 . 
  after they won though , they abolished * free * and * fair * elections , thus the 3rd reich * ceased to be * a democracy . 
  if a country is * democratic * , it simply means it has free and fair elections with a real impact on how country is governed each few years . 
  that 's the basic meaning of this word . 
  you can add many more requirements to make it a * specific brand * of democracy , but they are not essential to * democracy * itself . 
   cringe worthy post , which i save here for posterity . 
  i should start doing the same with your comments regarding poland , if i started earlier i would already have a quite sizable cringe collection by now . 
  what makes a country * democratic * is having a free elections once in a while . 
  that 's it , there are no other requirements . 
  you might have confused it with some other term here . 
   danzig gda\u0144sk * was * polish before partitions , for a long time it even was the biggest city in poland , as well as our main port through which we exported our goods to other kingdoms . 
  shows how much you know about other topics when you make such basic mistakes . 
   yes but if the ukranians desire a nation , they should have it , do n't you think ? 
  but if poles - who were also living there - desire a nation , they can suck it because what poles desire is not important , am i right ? 
   am i wrong to say that in east poland they 're a minority ? 
  that depends on which part of east poland you are talking about . 
  in some , like volhynia , polesie or stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w voivodship poles were a minority . 
  in some , like wilno area or tarnopol they were n't . 
  despite popular opinion , the humanity is not divided simply into two nations of `` poles '' and `` non-poles '' , and as there were more than two nationalities living in that region back then ( most notably jews ) , it turns out that even in many of those 30-40 % areas poles were actually the * most numerous ethnic group * . 
  [ map to illustrate . 
  ] ( http://s24.postimg.org/u4d92sedh/polacy_na_kresach.png )  and could you confirm that those eastern regions are the ones occupied by the soviets in 39-40 ? 
  i can confirm that * some * areas invaded by soviets in 1939 , like volhynia or polesie had poles in small minority , and if that was all soviets occupied nobody in poland would really care about that . 
  the problem is - soviet union occupied way more than those , including multiple areas with polish majority and plurality , with some of the most important polish core cultural centers . 
   check out gerrymandering . 
  it 'll blow your mind : check out the [ ethnic distribution of poles in pre-war poland by county ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/polish_language_frequency_in_poland_in_1931.png ) , it 'll blow your mind . 
   and the reason it is not a coincidence is because those areas where poland and romania are touching ** were inhabited in their majority by ukranians . 
  **  tarnopol ( where poland touched romania at cernauti ) it it ** inhabited 49 % by polish , 46 % by ukranians ** but if you look at the map , you see that only in the cities do polish outnumber ukranians , in the country side and in the south of tarnopol the majority are ukranian ) contradicting yourself within a one post is quite a feat . 
   helping poland lose civil rights , liberties would you mind sharing with me the revelation which civil rights and liberties were supposedly `` lost '' . 
  you seem to be better informed than me . 
   and russianizing the media seems that polish media were `` russianized '' from the very beginning then . 
  state-owned media in poland were always government-controled ( in this particular case , controled by the * former * government until the recent changrs ) , and private media are unaffected and free to report with whatever bias they like . 
   get their legitimacy purely on the basis of being loudly anti-refugee not really , they were already leading in polls way before the migrant crisis became a major talking point . 
  sure , it might have contributed to entrenching their lead later on , but if you think that 's the * primary * reason they got elected , it shows how shallow is your understanding of situation in poland . 
  glad to see hungarians being bros as always . 
   polish socialists all three of them . 
   nationalists polish nationalists are * mostly * anti-russian , usually more so than the average pole . 
  even though at the same time many of them may consider * putin 's way of ruling russia * to be a correct way , it does n't mean they would like poland to * align with * russia as they see russia as a rival , not a potential ally . 
   language is a huge part of culture , many would argue the biggest and most relevant part . 
  and the fact is , that polish and russian languages share a common ancestor - proto-slavic language . 
  they both separately evolved from it starting around 1500 years ago . 
  that 's all there 's to it . 
  in a similar way , italian , haitian creole and romanian languages share a common ancestor - latin language . 
  other than that , there 's really not that much in common between those three cultures . 
   then it shows a deep cultural relationship the only `` deep cultural relationship '' it shows is that our * languages * had a common ancestor at one point - it 's around 15 centuries ago in this particular case , so they did n't diverge enough to be completely unintelligible yet . 
   i am just curious why are polish people so desperate to deny these ties that are obvious to any outsider . 
  which ties in particular ? 
  because the only `` ties '' you have mentioned so far was that both languages belong to the same language family and descend from the same proto-language . 
  that 's where the similarities between the languages come from as ever since they diverged around 6th-7th century , there 's was not much exchange between polish and russian languages - * russian * influences in polish are very sparse and uncommon , and i 'm quite sure it 's similar the other way around . 
   i know a russian girl who i witnessed can talk fluently to polish people and she told me she never learned any polish . 
   my dad when he visited warsaw could understand many things based on his vague russian he used to speak when he was young . 
  yes , languages sharing a common ancestor have enough similar vocabulary , to be somewhat understandable if both sides put a bit of an effort to it . 
  news at 11 . 
   i am telling you , from an outsider 's point of view ( who does n't speak any of the slavic languages ) the ties are obvious . 
  of course the * linguistic * ties are obvious - that 's how language families work . 
   simple mp not a `` simple mp '' , but the chairman and leader of the biggest party in polish parliament . 
  sadly , he has never really recovered to his 2010-2014 performance levels ever since he suffered that injury a year ago . 
   all hail the new government . 
  til the new government invented debt . 
   you 're joking right ? 
  implying poland is a better destination than estonia ? 
  you are joking as well , right ? 
  implying estonia is a better destination than poland ? 
   our closest language relatives are the finns . 
  no , your closest language relatives are [ khanty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khanty_people ) and [ mansi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mansi_people ) peoples from siberia . 
  their language is way closer to hungarian than either finnish or estonian . 
  you are ridiculous for denying your cultural ties with them . 
   you guys are ridiculous for denying your cultural ties with russia . 
  oh , i was quite sure we were talking about * language relatives * and now suddenly you start with * cultural * ties ? 
  those are two entirely different things . 
  aside the fact that their language * sounds * kinda decipherable for us ( unless it 's written , then for most people it could be chinese well enough ) , though in fact it 's mostly unintelligible without earlier preparation , our * cultural * ties with russia are similarly barely existent to hungarian ties with russia . 
  anyhow , going by this `` language relatives = cultural ties '' absurd , it would seem that you hungarians have some cultural ties to your closest kinsmen - uralic peoples in siberia , then a little bit of cultural ties to finns and estonians ( though , as you yourself noticed , even this is almost nil ) , and next to none cultural ties to the rest of europe . 
  cool to hear , though rather contrary to * my personal * perception of hungarians . 
  50 % turnout in parliamentary elections is actually rather high for poland .

  that 's how germans who could n't pronounce the original name coped with that , sure . 
  it 's not that bad approximation actually . 
  such a shame he missed the electoral threshold by 0.24 % . 
  i 've been here since / r/europe had around 10k subscribers , quite considerate of pis to plan so far into the future . 
  le old `` people disagree with me , they must be paid shills '' , amirite ? 
   'm not sure europe even had any concept of common values pre-1968 to begin with of course it had , at least since the middle ages , especially among western christendom . 
  it continued though various movements like renaissance or enlightement which were also shared by france , poland or italy alike .
