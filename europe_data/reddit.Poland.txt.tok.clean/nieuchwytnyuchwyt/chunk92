  you do n't pick and choose law you follow . 
   i remember 2007 very well . 
  their failure was preceded by layers and layers of bullshit and idiocy . 
  of course it was , their 2007 campaign was atrocious . 
  i distinctly recall being happy about it as i was still a staunch po supporter back then . 
   but whatever , believe in kaczynski strategic genius if you want . 
  as long as this belief will seem to be supported by the happenings , i 'll keep doing that . 
   haha , whatever , just observe . 
  i have seen it before , done by the very same people and they behave exactly like they did before . 
  i 've been observing for well over a decade , and my conclusions have significantly evolved during that time . 
   no need to trust my prediction , really , just see what they do and how they do after they eliminate the constitutional opposition . 
  it 's a foolish hope , not a prediction . 
  well , whatever helps you sleep at night . 
  i guess you should , because i put an actual effort to have all my * factual claims * in here to be are entirely reasonable , truthful and valid . 
  obviously , * factual claims * should n't be mistaken with my * opinions * , which are even more plenty . 
   neither prime minister nor parliament decides which matter is complex and should be decided upon by the full squad . 
  i do n't know about * zawi\u0142a * ( complex ) , but beyond any shadow of doubt this matter is * donios\u0142a * ( significant ) . 
  as a citizen , i am very concerned by the chairman of tribunal proceeding in a 5-judge squad instead of full squad despite that , it seems that everyone has the written law in blatant disregard lately . 
   oh , so early elections i do n't know how well you remember 2007 , but the early elections were a * gamble * . 
  at the moment they were called pis was actually leading in polls , and until almost the end of campaign it remained very close . 
  moreover , pis made many pr mistakes during the campaign , and kaczy\u0144ski severely lost the tv debate with tusk . 
  again , the early elections were * a part of the plan * . 
  they simply screwed the electoral campaign really hard , though this experience seemed to serve as an important lesson to them . 
   loss of power for a decade was a success ? 
  no , the fact that during the loss of power lasting for almost a decade they * consolidated * , eliminated most of competition , and ultimately returned to power stronger than before was a success . 
   humiliations will be dished out , factions will arise , ambitions will conflict . 
  one of the reasons for the current conflict with tk is to avoid it - both potential faction leaders are now tied down by the danger of potential state tribunal charges in case they try to fracture . 
   coupled with external pressures due to gross incompetence i do n't really want to worry you , but the alleged `` incompetence '' is considerably overblown by certain faction of media . 
  one should read a broad array of news sources to avoid having his vision overly clouded by their biases . 
  at least we are better than north italy . 
  you are the one claiming that , so the burden of proof lies on you . 
   including their previous stint in the government their previous stint in government included clever long-term moves , such as destroying * both * populist parties that were naive enough to enter coalition with them , * and * taking over a better chunk of their electorate . 
  if that 's the reason you infer that they `` will destroy themselves '' then you sadly completely failed to understand much of what happened during the last ten years . 
   they will destroy themselves , they wo n't , everyone that could lead a conflicting faction has been long purged/left on his own long ago . 
  thus , you are a second-generation ** immigrant ** . 
  i recall they already have surplus of them in krak\u00f3w . 
   stop lying to others . 
  i 'm literally quoting the law . 
   according to art . 
  2 chairman of tribunal is a one do decided when to use art . 
  f . a shame he did n't then , because while the `` complex '' part is up to discussion , this particular matter is indubitably * significant * . 
  seems that the chairman of tribunal does not treat his responsibilities seriously . 
   also according to art . 
  3 full squad needs at least 9 judges . 
  precisely , and instead only 5 judges took part in this ruling . 
  that 's at least four too few to consider it a full squad . 
   because of some technicality that is n't even true ( there is no law stating that court needs to debate in full squad ) . 
   the constitutional tribunal rules in ** full squad ** on particularly ** complex or significant ** matters . 
  ( art . 
  we do n't have one anymore either . 
  we were silly enough to sell our carmaker to daewoo which went bankrupt in late 90s , instead of vw or renault like czechs or romanians did . 
  sadly , the chance for that was lost 70 years ago . 
  yeah , he missed the dash over n , it 's * gda\u0144sk * actually . 
  a common mistake . 
  yeah , [ that 's how it looked like in 1958 ] ( http://p3.wawalove.pl/p3.wawalove.pl/d0bf2dc69aacc2d345540eb6253ef0a2.jpg ) . 
  it actually was a quite factual assumption , as excluding a few landmarks like the old town or royal route that were rebuilt , or an odd lone original building that somehow survived to this day , most of it - including the typical 19th century european urban core of pre-war warsaw - is indeed gone . 
   best case scenario , sanctions and a temporary suspension from the eu . 
  yeah , reminds me of all those terrible sanctions and suspensions hungary suffered in recent years . 
  oh , wait , they did n't . 
  just wait until you see the countries in 10-million-people-and-smaller-tier , most of them have parliaments half the size of the us one while being over 30 times smaller . 
  well , almost every country seems small in comparison to the 3rd biggest and 3rd most populous country in the world . 
   for 5 years . 
  by various people . 
  my point still stands . 
  it was being written almost exclusively during the rule of post-commies . 
   my point still stands . 
  nah , your point was that the constitution apparently appeared out of thin air one spring morning in 1997 , and thus it totally was not written `` just after '' fall of communism . 
   now this is a statement you should 've written from the beginning . 
  i could n't have written anything , as i 'm not the op . 
   did n't know 8 years is `` just after '' . 
  it was being written at least since 1992 . 
   and by ex-opposition and the church members and the rest of parliament . 
  well , the ex-commies were the ones who had a deciding voice while writing it . 
  though indeed , they included some ex-opposition 's and the church 's ideas as a compromise in order to not have the constitution fail miserably in the referendum ( and it still barely passed anyway ) . 
  \\  poland \\  small country if we are * small * , everyone in europe is small . 
  perhaps except russia , they could be `` average-sized '' on such scale . 
  there are a lot of intermediate points between the two extremes you are preaching here . 
  and the * continent * wo n't disappear if we cease those fruitless efforts . 
  well , the entire point of nato is that us is there , so i guess no . 
   no one ever heard of that is , if you have never done groceries in poland in your lifetime . 
  except the president is rarely * neutral * , as usually a partisan candidate ends up becoming one . 
   nato aims to act proportionally yeah , apparently not building bases in poland because an alleged 1997 deal with russia forbids it counts as ` acting proportionally ' . 
   perhaps your threat assessment is different than that of nato . 
  indeed , perhaps it is . 
   canada [ canada has numerous extensive cooperation systems with us , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_aerospace_defense_command ) and they enjoy full protection of the domestic us nuclear weapons system , especially considering that most nukes targeting us would have to fly over canada first . 
   denmark , norway , greece or spain ? 
  norway aside ( and even here it 's a stretch ) none of the other countries are in a comparable geopolitical position to poland . 
   if you have so little trust in nato i have little trust of nato because of its attitude towards any kind of military deployment in poland so far , if this attitude would change so would my trust in nato . 
  for one , it would show a clear message that we are not a second-class members of nato . 
   sorry , but we are nowhere near close to the danger of the cuban missile crisis . 
  no , in terms of tensions , thankfully we are not there . 
  on the other hand , in the terms of potential danger to us though , from * our * perspective russian missiles in kaliningrad are no different than soviet/russian missiles in cuba from american perspective . 
   this alone shows your lack of awareness of history and geopolitical and nuclear events . 
  i am very much knowledgeable of history , as well as geopolitical and nuclear events , thank you very much . 
  that 's precisely why , to counter the danger we are in , i would consider the polish nuclear program to be the best option , but as it would be very expensive , impractical as well as hurt our international relations by breaking many treaties , hosting nato nukes is a good enough equivalent . 
   not really . 
  that 's what you try to convey in your posts so far , why are you backpedalling now ? 
   so if it has been countered , the `` unsafe geopolitical position '' does n't exist . 
  no , we have * attempted * to counter it , just like we similarly attempted to do so by signing alliance treaties with france and uk in 1939 . 
  whether or not those measures will prove to be effective this time , or merely worthless pieces of paper , is an open question .
