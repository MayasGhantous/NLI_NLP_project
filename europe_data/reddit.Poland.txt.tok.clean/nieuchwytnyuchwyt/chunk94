  untrue , the majority of bosnia * n * s are christian - orthodox serbs and catholic croats . 
  on the other hand , the majority of bosnia * k * s are indeed muslim , but less than half of population of entire bosnia and herzegovina is bosnia * k * . 
  bosnia is not even close to majority muslim . 
  i would n't really want to exchange russia for north korea and potentially china as well either , but the situation is fundamentally quite similar in either case - for now both of our countries are being kept safe from potential agressors mostly by the power of uncle sam . 
  yeah , we are on par with south korea in that regard . 
  completely irrelevant to the discussion . 
  i 'm approving * this particular * action of turkey here ( and wish it was treated as a role model in regards to further treatment of russian jets entering the nato airspace ) , and not everything turkey ever did , contributed to or stood for . 
  if we would n't commit to it , we would have likes of / u/jtalin whining about `` poland bitching all the time about the dangerous position they are in , yet do nothing to counter that other than leeching on us defence budget '' instead . 
  some people just can not ever be satisfied . 
  i cheer for our nato ally protecting their airspace from notorious offender , nothing more . 
  if they deem such course of action necessary , why not . 
  considering that despite tensions , both countries remain * allied * in nato , i guess that 's not the case here . 
  anyhow , i 'm not approving of turkey 's actions because i have any particular liking for erdogan , but because thanks to it russia finally recieved what it long deserved for their numerous hostile excursions towards multiple nato states . 
  because it was high time someone finally called russia out on their border incursions with military aircraft . 
  the same thing should happen each time one of their military jets illegally enters airspace of poland or baltics , until they learn their lesson . 
  there are no tsunamis or magnitude 9 earthquakes in poland . 
  well , seems it 's high time the dutch people finally started `` implementing measures to stop climate change '' themselves then , as they are emiting way more greenhouse gases per capita than poland . 
  actually in that regard the netherlands are among the heaviest polluters in the entire eu , one could almost say that you guys just like to live on edge and endanger a large part of the country yourselves . 
   still the water level wo n't rise not exactly , as only already floating ice melting wo n't raise the water level any further . 
  on the other hand , ice on land melting would result in surplus water added to the system , so it certainly would rise , just like level of water in a glass would rise if you went to the fridge and dropped several new ice cubes into it . 
   however it 's not very likely for the whole ice of antarctica to melt . 
  it 's not very likely indeed ( in fact the latest findings suggest that the glacial on antarctica is actually growing right now ) , and thank god for that because it certainly would be a disaster . 
   ice has bigger volume than water , which means that when ice is melting , the water level is not going rising . 
  you realize that not all ice on earth is floating in oceans , and there 's a lot of glacials on land as well , for example on antarctica or greenland , right ? 
  even if there were , they were probably sold long ago , just like reactors and most of other sellable equipment from the unfinished plant . 
  we tried to do so in the 80s , but right when we were [ finishing our first nuclear plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbarnowiec_nuclear_power_plant ) the chernobyl disaster happened , and due to protests connected with it the construction was first suspended , and sadly eventually cancelled in 1990 . 
  at least not all of germany was soviet-occupied , only a quarter of it , so you got quite lucky in that regard when compared to poland . 
  well , i guess you are not really informed on the topic then . 
  percentagewise , poland suffered both higher loss of population , as well as destruction of infrastructure and industry than either soviet union or germany . 
   the entente powers agreed to create the polish state . 
  but did not specify its borders . 
  it would be a rump state like duchy of warsaw if we did n't fought for it , and that 's only in best case . 
   and also minsk ? 
  minsk was within the 1772 borders . 
  in fact , even within the 1792 ones . 
   any case , you 're first act as an independent state was to start a war inside the russian empire in a state of civil war itself . 
  our first act was disarming the german soldiers in warsaw , the first clashes with soviet troops started many months later . 
  no other country was fucked up so much by ww2 either . 
  that was our war of independence , of course we fought the russian troops . 
  kiev aside , we did n't push beyond the pre-1772 border back then . 
  yeah , in 16th century . 
  we fought against them , and that did n't help us in the slightest . 
   despite russia basically having done nothing to it \\  conveniently ignoring that russia has been an asshole to poland for 400 years prior to the end of the cold war . 
  a huge support . 
  sadly there seems to be a constant sabotage coming mostly from our `` ally '' germany which prevents them from finally materialising . 
   so if poland does not want the eu and would get out . 
  no , the polish government seeks a distant and opt-out position in eu , similar to the one uk has right now . 
   who would be their ally in europe nato . 
   would they have to turn back to russia ? 
  no , they would seek even closer military cooperation with usa . 
   or would it be enough for them to ally with the uk ( if they would also want to ? ), 
  they certainly consider uk an important ally in preventing the expansion of eu influence in member states . 
  that 's because they were ruling through a very fragile , exotic and broad coallition back then , and not a stable singe-party majority like now . 
  one can be also attacked because some thugs want to steal your cellphone , or because they do n't like your haircut . 
  the world is a dangerous place . 
  anyhow , * actually * attacking people * is * illegal , regardless of the motive . 
  saying mean things is not , and certainly should n't be . 
  unlike russia , america is allied with turkey . 
   constant 2000 $ yes , constant 2000 us dollars . 
  that 's the best way to make a meaningful comparison over a long period of time . 
  if you want to feel even sadder , check the version of this chart by purchasing power parity . 
   90 % of poorland growth is based of european funds we were growing just as fast in the 90s , while you were busy desperately struggling to keep your gdp above the kazakh one . 
   i guess being germany lapdog is good at something well , i guess you are jelly nobody even wants romania to be their lapdog : dd indeed , that 's exactly what we used to do until the last month , and so far it has worked quite well for us . 
   or maybe they just want to be sure east prussia will not fall too much behind for when they will take it back joke 's on them , we are not investing much into former east prussia , and there 's nothing there besides a bunch of lakes and forests . 
   receiving pity funds doesent mean your country is rich . 
  oh , it 's not rich , it 's simply way better off than romania ever will be in foreseeable future . 
   when germany is waiving their arms poorland is hiding in the corner too afraid it will be beat again . 
  yeah , that 's precisely why we told them the last week that we wo n't take in any of their surplus illegal migrants . 
  i noticed you are around 12 , so worry not and keep trying , and perhaps one day your bantz will finally be top notch . 
  the question was n't whether it is going to make money , but whether the government can dictate what exactly a state-owned theatre produces . 
  it 's the question of bringing profit which is * actually * irrelevant here . 
  i think you are mistaken here , it 's a state - * owned * theatre , not a state - * subsidised * one . 
  yeah , and you are only [ 8-10 years behind ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:rom:hun:kaz&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) poorland , i guess it 's not that bad . 
  anyhow , top banter m8 . 
     the list presents statistics for 2010 from the eurostat , as of 3 june 2013 . 
  the figures are in millions of nominal euros , purchasing power standards and per capita . 
    the data i posted is from 2013 there is no significant difference between polish and romanian levels of growth in 2010-2013 period . 
  [ in fact , poland grew a bit faster ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=poland+romania+gdp+growth+since+2010 ) so if anything such comparison would be even more in favour of poland in 2013 . 
   not acording to official data no ? 
  it is according to the very source you have cited . 
  transylvania = eastern poland , eastern and southern romania = tier lower than anything in poland . 
   sorry but germany lapdog can not be a tier better than romania seems that someone 's * really * butthurt that his country economically is one tier lower than poland or hungary : dddd  yes because buchares-ilfov doesent include villages , only poor warsaw does . 
  yes , that 's the whole point . 
  bucharest-ilfov is an area exclusively made up out of bucharest and its agglomeration , while on the other hand mazowieckie is a big region spanning 1/8 of poland , with warsaw being only a small portion of it . 
  if there existed an analogous warsaw-and-nearby-towns region in poland , it would have a higher gdp per capita than bucharest-ilfov . 
   i will stop wasting my time with you now , good luck in your unicorn world . 
  says the guy living in an unicorn world , who thinks that romania is on the same level as poland : ddd, 
   not acroding to official data released be european commision it doesent according to the data you have linked few post earlier ? 
  the [ polish regions ] ( http://www.gnatowski.org/trees/poland/adminpolandlarge.jpg ) that were being compared in this data are big and do not constitute out of only one city but also the countryside , which significantly flattens poland 's result . 
  on the other hand , romanian regions used in this study [ look like this . 
  ] ( http://www.romania-central.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/map-romania-nuts-ii-development-regions.jpg ) as bucharest metro is a separate region , it will obviously be quite high , and be a top value for romania by a large margin . 
  if you looked into the detailed data though , you would notice that all the other romanian regions are well below polish regions - with even the most well-off romanian regions in transylvania being comparable to the poorest polish regions in eastern poland . 
  [ the data is here , sort by gdp per capita to compare . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_regions_by_gdp )  poland is 100000 times better than romania . 
  not really , poland is merely one tier better than romania , with eastern poland being comparable to transylvania when taking the purchasing power into account . 
   some zones doesent even have paved roads has the same purchasing power like the section where is the financial hub and the multinationals is located yes , just like in the data you have posted the financial hub of warsaw and some villages near the belarusian border are counted as a one area ( with the city of warsaw having high enough gdp , that the entire region of mazowieckie has a gdp per capita over the eu average ) . 
   no , is done by counties not postal code areas well , on this map * poland * is definitely divided by postal code areas , not by counties . 
  it 's literally written on the map as well . 
  perhaps postal code areas are identical with counties in romania , i do n't know . 
   so your warsaw - bucharest being different is bullshit why would it be ?
