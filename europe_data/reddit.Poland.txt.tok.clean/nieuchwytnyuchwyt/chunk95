  i do n't see warsaw area looking like this [ big `` mazowieckie '' blob ] ( http://www.gnatowski.org/trees/poland/adminpolandlarge.jpg ) on this map , quite the contrary as not only is the city separated from its region , but it 's even divided into districts by postal codes . 
   also is veeeery hard to believe counties like cluj - napoca were a lot of it jobs in romania are located has the same purchasing power like random east poland counties . 
  not really , the poorest parts of poland are comparable in purchasing power to the most well-off parts of romania . 
  also , i notice that cluj on this map is is not a separate area ( like the similarly sized cities of bydgoszcz or kielce in poland , which are green on this map ) but also includes a fair portion of the countryside . 
   the map is the biggest bullshit i ever saw . 
  the only problem i see on this map is lack of definite information what each color bracket exactly constitutes ( and perhaps the lack of another tier on the very bottom , which would probably be useful to differentiate between romania and , say , ukraine or albania ) . 
   than any region in poland that 's because our capital is not a separate region like in romania , but a part of a much bigger and - the warsaw metropolitan area aside - not really that well-off region in eastern poland ( and still manages to bring it over the european average ) . 
  this map on the other hand is done by post code areas , not administrative regions , and as you can clearly see the * city of warsaw * definitely has way better purchasing power than the city of bucharest . 
  that was a military flight ( the plane was operated by the 36th special regiment of aviation transport ) , not a commercial one . 
   you voted for the government the government voted for it , thats how representative democracy works when a government that lost much of its popular support since the elections 4 years earlier makes a baffling decision without much support in society and completely contrary to the previously agreed stance i 'd consider mentioning it and complaining about such situation a quite normal thing to do . 
   do n't go around crying about germany when your government fucks up ... of course it fucked up - in fact that 's exactly why they did it , as the last few months of the former government were spent mostly on making as many things as possible as difficult as possible for the government coming after the elections ( the current one ) . 
  that was not an exception . 
  well , remember that despite the current voivodship borders neither \u0141om\u017ca , nor suwa\u0142ki are historically parts of podlasie - \u0141om\u017ca was a part of masovia , and suwa\u0142ki area ( suwalszczyzna ) is a distinct region which was a part of the historical grand duchy of lithuania . 
   did the country converge to a preexisting accent or the modern polish is itself a `` brand new '' accent ? 
  kind of both - the `` standard polish '' is neither of the 5 large traditional polish dialects ( great poland , little poland , masovia , silesia , eastern-borderlands ) , but rather a separate organic development , with the greatest influence of greater polish and lesser polish dialects . 
  it existed in some form for the last several hundred years , with most of the literary works since at least renaissance being quite consistent in their language and easily understandable to a modern reader without prior preparation . 
  you wo n't be missed . 
   you voted for it the previous government did , and was voted out of office by a landslide soon after doing so . 
  romania voted against . 
  an important part of europe , that needs to be contained and treated as an international pariah until their invasion and aggression on another sovereign european nation ceases . 
  zero tolerance for that . 
  well , no point in talking to a putinboo simpleton either . 
  come back when you reach at least basic level of international events knowledge . 
   there something that you do n't understand ? 
  i 'm quite sure that it is you who do n't understand the situation . 
   the situation is stable . 
  they 're not shooting at each other . 
  does n't matter one bit . 
  the cause of sanctions is the illegal russian invasion of ukraine , which continues to this day , and not `` aww , they are shooting at each other :( ( ( '' . 
  they have ? 
  i guess i must have somehow overlooked russia stopping their occupation of crimea , or disbandment of russian-supported rebels in donetsk and lugansk area then . 
  anyhow , until both of those things happen , our attitude towards russia should not change even one bit . 
  the problem is that they have n't * stopped * yet . 
  i can enlighten you on the [ logical fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slippery_slope ) used by the bulgarian poster as well . 
  i 'm afraid i did n't notice the part about `` starting to kill each other '' in the article , could you enlighten me please on what slipped my attention ? 
  well , however you look at it , poland technically * was * the first safe country for the chechen refugees . 
  that 's not the case here . 
  pis won in * all * age brackets . 
   well , you 've said that blaszczak 's accusation of wwii atrocities towards germany was n't really weird . 
  yeah , there 's no mistaking here , as we all clearly read in the article ,  * , , let 's start killing each other again over ww2 '' *  * - b\u0142aszczak , 2015 * were the exact words we are discussing here . 
  sure , and the whole point is that post-war architects had a real field day in warsaw thanks to the irreplaceable german contribution in preparing the room for them . 
   and cursing dead germans has what to do with current politics ? 
  why bring it up ? 
  oh , i 'm not saying it 's the * right * thing to bring up - i was simply irked by calling it a `` weird '' thing to say . 
  it 's simply an observation one passively notices all the time and almost on every step , nothing weird about it . 
  on the scale it happened in warsaw ? 
  i seriously doubt it . 
  [ this spot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/was3uca.jpg ) for example was almost in the very centre of the pre-war city . 
   yup , let 's all accuse and maybe start killing each other again i fail to see where exactly i have said anything even remotely resembling this statement . 
  quite a big strawman you built there , have n't you ? 
   jesus christ are you guys still blaming the germans ? 
   it 's been 70 years . 
  i do n't recall historical facts change with time . 
  even in 200 or 300 years , it will still be germans who were the ones to almost completely raze our capital and destroy a large part of our cultural heritage . 
   if warsaw is still a mess it 's entirely on you guys . 
  not really a mess , it 's simply almost completely devoid of historical districts that are plentiful in other european capitals . 
  the fact that the prevalent method of rebuilding until ~ 25 years ago was copy-pasting dozens of times several models of crappy and ugly concrete buildings also did n't help . 
  well , if not for germans , i do n't think the post-war corbusierist planners would have the * entire * city for a playground to realize their absurd visions . 
   what a weird thing to say . 
  not really , i live in warsaw and while walking around the city i often notice myself subconsciously cursing germans for how much they have fucked it up . 
  i 'd consider `` not getting rid of bolsheviks 70 years earlier '' a major crime against humanity . 
  after securing a limited victory , we have signed a peace treaty with soviet russia in 1921 , completely betraying our belarusian and ukrainian allies instead of pushing harder , teaming up with all the other anti-soviet forces and decisively destroying bolsheviks before they committed most of their atrocities . 
  pretty shitty decision in a hindsight . 
  my daily public transport commute . 
  well , it seems i recalled wrong then . 
  anyhow , seeing as you have n't regarded any other of my numerous arguments , i presume you agree with them and with the notion that soviet union could be easily considered a co-belligerent/ally of nazi germany until 1941 . 
   just as you signed a border treaty with czechoslovakia following your post-ww1 disputes . 
  we did n't . 
   well , the soviets also took a disputed part of poland . 
  not really , as soviets signed a border treaty with poland formally recognizing the border in 1921 . 
   after all , your government does n't claim that territory is polish even today . 
  * pacta sunt servanda , * a border treaty recognizing the border excluding various soviet-occupied areas was signed by the puppet government of soviet-occupied poland , and whether we like it or not , the current poland is a direct successor of that country . 
  well , if back then we took not only a disputed narrow strip of land , but also the entire slovakia , and it all happened after signing a secret protocol regarding the exact lines among which czechoslovakia would be divided in half , and then held a joint victory parade in brno , i 'm quite sure that indeed , it would count at least as a co-belligerence . 
   i just wanted to hint at one of the reasons for the steady and stable growth of poland poland already had steady and stable growth way before it started to receive any funds , and nothing has changed since then . 
   nonetheless , if you check the source i 've cited , you will see that poland gets more than romania , czech republic and hungary combined well , now neat of you to include romania in such comparison , considering that they do not even fully utilize the eu funds allocated to them . 
  i guess poland also gets more than , say , netherlands , belgium and sweden combined , even though they are comparable to us in total population . 
  as i already said , there are 7 eu countries with higher per-capita eu net gain than poland , and those are portugal , greece , slovakia , hungary , estonia , lithuania and latvia . 
  i would n't necessarily consider all of them to be examples of `` steady and stable growth '' , despite even higher relative influx of funds . 
   is that why so many poles live and work outside of poland ? 
  no , that 's because we can - unlike russians who have a rather hard time legally living and working outside of russia . 
   that means ~ 2 % of the current gdp of 525 bln usd is added to the gdp by the eu every year you realize that this is the case of like half of the eu countries , and not a poland-exclusive phenomenon , right ? 
  actually many countries , like greece , baltic states , portugal or hungary receive much more than poland per capita . 
  yeah , just [ look ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/armia_czerwona%2cwehrmacht_23.09.1939_wsp%c3%b3lna_parada.jpg ) at those totally-not-allies , [ shaking hands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/spotkanie_sojusznik%c3%b3w.jpg ) after their [ joint victory parade ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/bundesarchiv_bild_101i-121-0011a-23%2c_polen%2c_siegesparade%2c_guderian%2c_kriwoschein.jpg ) held in the middle of cooperatively defeated poland on september 22 , 1939, 
  i could swear we are forever second on these charts lately , and there 's always some romania or other czech republic to deny us the lead . 
  no , i bitch about the part where it 's apparently normal in your countries to be fired from your job because of your political views . 
  that sounds really dystopian and like something straight from the era of the soviet occupation . 
   yeah . 
   you sure love `` free speech '' . 
  the article 257 of the penal code forbids * publishing * nation-specific insults . 
  we also have similar laws against publishing slanders , or untrue accusations , or even insulting the president . 
  in a private conversation however , you are free to say whatever you want . 
   here will arrive a point when you 'll get fired from work for shouting homophobic stuff . 
  not on a basis of currently existing laws . 
   or for insult the bible , wtf poland is more restrictive on hate speech than france those are blasphemy laws , not `` hate speech '' . 
  misinformed as usual , are n't you ? 
   i dont have to like it . 
  it already is happening in any normal country . 
  i 'm glad we are not a `` normal country '' then . 
   nope . 
  hate speech will get your ass fired in france , uk , germany .
