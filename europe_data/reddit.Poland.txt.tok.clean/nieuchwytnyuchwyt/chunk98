  you realize that it 's entirely possible to be pro-life and non-religious , right ? 
  it 's not a purely `` based on religion '' issue . 
  uk results are even more interesting , with the top three being kukiz , pis and korwin , each getting a bit over 20 % of votes . 
  zero , they failed to get past the electoral threshold . 
  zero . 
  they failed to get enough signatures to even register their candidates . 
   so can they get no seats ? 
  if they fail to reach a good result in the electoral district they start in , they wo n't get any seats just like any other party with a weak result would n't . 
   and the other parties are allowed to participate in the elections there too , right ? 
  yeah , the nation-wide parties also participate in elections there . 
  there are multiple parliament seats available in each electoral district , and after the votes are counted they are assigned in a way proportional to the result . 
   how many ? 
  that depends on their electoral results . 
  it used to be 2-3 in the 90s ( with as high as 7 in 1991 ) , nowadays it 's usually one seat . 
   what 's the system ? 
  the exact same as with any other party , the only difference being that as a minority committee they do n't need to pass the countrywide 5 % threshold to have their result taken into consideration . 
  in fact , if only one colour was used for each party , they would be barely noticeable . 
  that 's actually where the belarusian minority lives . 
   who was that self righteous cunt asking for `` culture '' ? 
  sejm marshal ( speaker of the parliament ) [ marek jurek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marek_jurek ) . 
   doesnt change the fact that k\u00f6nigsberg is and was always german/prussian . 
  yeah , until uncle stalin decided one day that he fancy a warm baltic sea port , bombed it to oblivion , demolished what remained of its ruins , built shitty commieblocks all over it and settled them with russians : dd  even today it would be de jure german . 
  * de jure * , even today prussia would merely remain a rebellous vassal of the king of poland . 
  personally , i prefer the [ 1648 ] ( http://img09.deviantart.net/ad89/i/2013/141/8/9/europe__ad_1648____the_peace_of_westphalia_by_undevicesimus-d61mavp.jpg ) ones . 
  the small polish province of prussia still knew its place back then . 
   they will split you faster yeah , the might of your broomsticks is legendary indeed . 
   his salary is coming out of our tax money . 
  i dont want to pay for that idiot thank you very much . 
  i do n't want my taxes to be spent on commie meps either , but sadly this is not how it works . 
  actually , both stockholm and oslo have earlier sunset in the winter . 
  warsaw has short days in the winter , and as it 's quite in the north , moving to another timezone wo n't change this situation ( and i 'd rather have sunset at 3pm in the winter than sunrise at 9am , really ) . 
  also , we have * always * used the cet , and it * is * our natural timezone ( as in noon is the closest to 12pm ) . 
   do you know the buzz words around this election ? 
  \\ #polandinruins, 
  the last time i checked , norway ranks higher on economical freedom than poland . 
  with their very liberal economic model they are actually one of the * last * countries in the world that could be described as `` socialist '' . 
   the other end of the scale is just as bad . 
  definitely not , communism is * way * , way worse . 
   that shit has worked out well in the past , right ? 
  so far , that shit seems to have worked out way better than putting all the power in hands of the left-wing marxist lunatics , which was sadly also tried out in our country . 
   the conclusion is that right-wing is the only truth ? 
  well , the conclusion that we have reached so far is that socialism does not work . 
  initially - in the 80s - commies had really low support levels , in single digit numbers . 
  during the 90s , after they transformed into a - nominally - socialdemocratic party , their support strongly but steadily grew , and they were one of the two major political blocks in poland ( the other being what emerged out of anti-commie opposition , post-solidarity ) . 
  post-commies won the elections in 2001 , but did such an atrocious and embezzlement-ridden performance , that after the term ended their role as a major political block was over forever . 
  on the other hand the post-solidarity bloc , which since the 80s has gone through various disintegrations , reintegrations and re-disintegrations many times , ultimately consolidated into two major parties around that time - which are current po and pis . 
  those parties successfuly took over not only the post-solidarity voters , but also expanded into the void left by ( now completely compromised ) post-commies . 
  this situation mostly persisted to this day , although po seems to be in a serious decline lately . 
  the poles living in poland , a group that among others happens to include myself , are those who * did n't * emmigrate anywhere . 
  the fact that church in finland is mostly a local protestant church , and not the roman catholic one could have something to do with it . 
   romania 's most important party after the revolution was the left wing party . 
  that 's because unlike poland , romania did not have a mass anti-communist resistance movement that lasted for a decade , out of which influential non-left wing parties and political leaders not connected with the communists could instantly emerge . 
  i do n't recall immigrating anywhere . 
   seriously , that 's not our fault that you were moved west . 
  not your fault ? 
  we would n't be , if you did n't start the fucking war in the first place . 
  nah , i am simply happy that after 26 years we finally got rid of post-commies . 
  finally ending the rule of po that completely betrayed their programme is a nice bonus . 
  i have never been so happy about election results before . 
  the only thing that would make it better would be korwin making it in as well . 
  every single historical book or map of europe regarding the 1387-1497 period , as well as interpretation of those treaties in kingdom of poland begs to differ then . 
  though i 'm quite sure the international historical community will be interested in your discovery , you should share it . 
  just for your information , the pokuttia matter was regarded in * another * treaty , signed long after the pledge of vassalage . 
   there never was such an arrangement , of course there was , in fact there were multiple ones . 
  [ petru ii of moldavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petru_ii_of_moldavia ) signed such agreement in 1387 , and similar agreememts were also signed by all the moldavian rulers during the following 90 years . 
  i do n't recall we ever had live threads for local elections * anywhere * . 
   principality of moldavia principality of moldavia was a vassal of poland until 1487 , thus it 's depicted in poland 's colour . 
  absence of serbia and croatia is easily explained as well :  in 1402 it was actually an ally of hungary under stefan lazarevic exactly , in * 1402 * . 
  on the other hand , this map shows the situation as of a.d. * 1400 * , and in this particular year serbia * was * a vassal of oe ( a relation that persisted between 1394 and 1402 in spite of earlier battle of kosovo ) . 
   oh and croatia was a separate country still , even if it shared a king with hungary . 
  it was in a personal union with hungary , just like lithuania was with poland , or denmark was with sweden . 
  the map is very consistent in how it treats this kind of situation , it * would * be ` shit ' if it made a special exception for croatia . 
   what kind of shit map is that ? 
  the only thing that 's shit here is your historical knowledge . 
  unemployment , gdp per capita , education levels and many other statistics are not really following this artificial russian - / prussian - partition divide . 
  while actually it was mostly used by prussian and russian agents to prevent * any * legislature from passing whatsoever . 
  surprise , surprise , who would have guessed . 
  or little too early , if they only waited a few more years until napoleon , then we would probably still exist after the congress of vienna where the european situation was roughly set in stone until the ww1 . 
   also if we do no reforms russia might not attacks us . 
  well , they * were n't * wrong . 
  the partitions of plc happened * precisely * because our nobility finally got their shit together and started to modernize and reform the country . 
  [ europe in 1400 , way before hungary `` teamed up with austria '' . 
  ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1400/1400.jpg ) notice the familiar shape ? 
   why does it have only two color instead of three ? 
  if you are really interested , because three colors are too mainstream , and our [ old flag design ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/chor%c4%85giew_kr%c3%b3lewska_kr%c3%b3la_zygmunta_iii_wazy.svg/1280px-chor%c4%85giew_kr%c3%b3lewska_kr%c3%b3la_zygmunta_iii_wazy.svg.png ) was already taken by austria . 
   hungary teamed up with austria to steal clay from surrounding nations . 
  hungary already had all those lands for over 500 years before habsburgs inherited their throne . 
   actually believed in communism , i 'm quite sure you could count those on fingers of a one hand . 
  communism in poland was pretty much dead as an ideology long before the system collapsed . 
   ask about your political alignment i do n't support any party in particular . 
  i 'm somewhat conservative on social issues , and liberal ( or perhaps even libertarian ) on economical issues . 
   which polish newspapers do you think are more trustworthy , if any ? 
  both rzeczpospolita and dziennik gazeta prawna , while not perfect either , are at least an order of magnitude more reputable as a news source than wyborcza . 
  murder 20 % of poles 2 . 
  wait 70 years 3 . 
  enjoy your increased relative power in europe . 
  long-term planning is important , is n't it ? 
  good , i really hope they 'll take enough electorate from zlew that it wo n't break the 8 % threshold . 
   is n't the gazeta one of poland 's most reputable newspapers ? 
  lol .
