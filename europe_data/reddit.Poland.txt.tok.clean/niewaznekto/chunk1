no , this is just `` funny '' map  the number is from some stats , but i do n't remember from which year . 
  [ 10204 ] ( https://9gag.com/gag/adm08jx/map-of-churches-in-poland-the-northern-parts-are-so-godless ) of roman catholic churches , afaik . 
  [ greenland ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/t/greenland-31326.jpg ) too . 
   the transition from communism to capitalism has been very poorly done in russia when it comes to `` people in power '' there has been no transition at all ... 
  well , i think it depends on which party the politician is from , at least here . 
  yes . 
  it 's usually about used goods , however on open-air markets you can come with anything you want - i see grannies selling dill , parsley and chive from their garden . 
  but there are usually no tables , so you need a folding stool and something to display your `` goods '' . 
  generally , the scale , frequency and rules vary in different cities/towns . 
  some images [ here ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=pchli+targ&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewih14_g0-htahvji8akhdr_bjmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=615 ) . 
   are you sure that 's not your national education office being stuck in the old thinking , just exchanging the content ? 
  i am sure indeed . 
  but it is still annoying . 
  i also think it depends on a country , school books are surely written by poles . 
  but some things that are co-financed by eu have way too many stickers , of course depends . 
  they have also some sort of * promotional products * . 
  sitting on a toilet in some new train coach and right in front of you on the mirror `` this was co-financed by eu '' , really ? 
  i do n't think it 's all necessary , along with the anthem . 
  people are aware they are part of eu , it does n't need to be announced everywhere . 
  also i do n't know why i 'm getting downvoted , my comment was exactly about `` little thing '' which annoys me and which came along with being eu citizen , at least here . 
  thanks , your handwriting is nice . 
  you apparently do n't have ** w ** in slovenian , so your print ** w ** in the word * handwriting * stands out . 
   i find it interesting that some of the examples from other countries are upright , not slanted . 
  i understand why as all russian textbooks i had taught slanted handwriting . 
  once i knew school girls born in london , their mother was russian and wanted to teach them cyrillic script . 
  girls were writing it upright , the font similar to english they had in school - it looked just ... very awkward and weird . 
  imo cyrillic script is just made to be handwritten slanted . 
  nice to hear that , thanks !, 
  i came across * why is cursive writing so looked down upon ? 
  * on r/askanamerican it reminded me feeling strange about foreigners ' handwriting i needed go through when working in london . 
  answers here are very interesting and now i 'm considering learning to handwrite with another font . 
   everyone thats posted in this has shown such `` fancy '' handwriting fonts , ours is so plain compared to that do n't worry - i bet their writing in real life is not so `` fancy '' :p, 
  thanks !, 
  your handwriting is very nice , a bit calligraphical . 
  * magyar k\u00e9z\u00edr\u00e1s * looks like the same font as spanish one posted by u/colako . 
   also lots and lots of people write `` o\u0304 '' and `` u\u0304 '' instead of '' \u00f6 '' and '' \u00fc '' i wondered how you distinct ** \u00f6 ** / ** \u0151 ** and ** \u00fc ** / ** \u0171 ** when writing fast . 
  thanks then . 
   i would see it as an opportunity to use the resources needed to teach two different forms of handwriting to teach touch typing instead . 
  i agree . 
  and for me , * basisschrift * looks the best of those three patterns anyway . 
  your current handwriting is very neat , congrats !, 
   there was a silly plane incident with turkey , but since then the relations mostly normalized . 
  there was one with poland too . 
  russia surely likes plane incidents :d i like russia though . 
  for me it 's this kitschy propaganda . 
  similar to the communist one people laugh at . 
  `` co-financing '' plates everywhere , flags , kids singing ~ ~ the internationale ~ ~ anthem of europe in schools and writing/teaching by heart some nursery rhymes about how eu is great ... that 's so ridiculous . 
  do they really think it helps eu to work ? 
  my mum works at school and teachers have flashbacks from their childhood in commie times :d, 
  favourite polish novel ? 
  i would go for [ pharaoh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pharaoh_ ( novel ) - political fiction from 19th century ; set in ancient egypt to avoid censorship ; translated into 22 languages ; i would recommend it to anybody who likes political fiction and/or ancient egypt ; it 's by prus , who 's considered a good writer here . 
  and he spent plenty of time studying ancient egypt stuff for the book , so there is * a compelling literary depiction of life at every level of ancient egyptian society * . 
  and it 's said stalin liked * pharaoh * the best :p the other one may be [ the promised land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_promised_land_ ( novel ) - * `` the story of three close friends and ruthless young industrialists : a pole , a german and a jew , struggling to build their own factory in the heartless world of the late 19th century labour exploitation . 
  '' * ; i like it as it 's set in my home city and its an insight how the city looked back in the days . 
  man who wrote it got nobel prize in 1924 , for another novel . 
  generally , i like things criticizing state/people , so the best for me were many plays i.e. 
  [ the morality of mrs. dulska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_morality_of_mrs._dulska_ ( play ) and many novellas from 19th century ( novellas are i.e. 
  * christmas carol * ) or anything by [ ignacy krasicki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignacy_krasicki ) , our famous enlightenment poet . 
  well , i like 19th century literature most , so i do n't know much about modern ( polish ) books . 
  those mentioned are one of polish classics . 
  no , i am not worried . 
  there is no reason , we have very few of them here . 
  and they wo n't probably come , because poland is simply too poor and our social welfare would n't be appealing to them . 
  plus germany is next to us - so i think they would choose germany for permanent stay . 
  we have mostly ukrainians coming so far . 
  the only muslims refugees in large scale in poland i have heard of , were the chechens and as far as i know they have n't committed any terrorist attacks . 
  i think we do n't have any experience in terrorist attacks at all . 
  the events i remember in details : * joining the eu in 2004 * death of john paul ii in 2005 * polish air force tu-154 crash in 2010 * hosting euro 2012 if sport events count and i lived during joining nato in 1999 , but then i was a kid playing around and did n't care much . 
  ** edit ** and world youth days last summer . 
  well , everybody has their unique handwriting , i know . 
  but in schools , when kids learn how to write , exercise books are based on one pattern . 
  in the english one , letters are separated and then i saw many people from london writing separate letters . 
  and shapes of some letters were different than i used to see here ( even in different people 's handwriting ) . 
  like in the example of looped cursive below : nobody here in poland would join two * o * s that way - with the line near the top of the letters . 
  well , it 's tough to describe such personal observation anyway . 
  the first example have something in common with russian writing i have learned . 
  yes , i understand . 
  i meant weird as surprising and amazing . 
  imagine you go to other country and they say `` catalonia '' is a title of satiric show  thanks for that information . 
  learned something new today !, 
  wow , that 's weird use of polonia and cracovia . 
  if i saw those titles in your tv guide , i would probably think they are documentaries :d, 
   what are the standard books at your high schools depends - if you are in humane class in high school then you have more polish classes = more reading . 
  a few books are obligatory , others are optional and teacher has to make their choice . 
  they may also tell you to read only extract from some books . 
  they choose from the list approved by the ministry of national education - and from that list i have picked foreign books . 
  for high schools : * bulgakov - the master and margarita , * kafka - the trial , * goethe - faust + the sorrows of young werther , * dante - divine comedy , * camus - the plague , * dostoevsky - crime and punishment , * balzac - father goriot , * eco - the name of the rose , * cervantes - don kichot ( usually extracts ) * huxley - brave new world * conrad - heart of darkness ( he was polish-british though ) * orwell - 1984 * marquez - one hundred years of solitude * some of sophocles , horace , orwell , shakespeare , moliere , chekhov * greek and roman mythology , the bible , tristan and iseult , the decameron for secondary schools : * hemingway - the old man and the sea , * dickens - christmas carroll , * tolkien - the hobbit , * saint-exup\u00e9ry 's novels ( little prince is obligatory , others are not ) , * jack london 's books * mitchell - gone with the wind , * orwell - animal farm . 
  generally , each person have read different set of books , depending on their teacher . 
  it does n't mean that random person have read all of the above . 
   how common is american literature ? 
  as you see , it is not common in the schools , though the american titles you have mentioned are just basics . 
  i have n't read * huckleberry finn * and * of mice and men * ( but read * the grapes of wrath * which is more popular i think ) . 
  well , i like literature , not everybody does . 
  we have more polish books than foreign in school , though . 
  my personal favourites of all time are russian classics . 
  i would add kashubia and some part of silesia are commonly known from their weird language . 
  at least their languages are separate on wikipedia  however , i would n't say * they are basically their own thing * . 
  i here simple * super * very often , too . 
  sometimes * grubo * = adverb from `` fat '' . 
  and how you could skip * zajebi\u015bcie * and all words with * zajeb - * prefix ?
