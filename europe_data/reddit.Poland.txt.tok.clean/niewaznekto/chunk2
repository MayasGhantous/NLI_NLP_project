  :p well , they are rather a cuss words , but the fact is they are rather commonly used . 
  they may have plenty of meanings though . 
  same in polish . 
  so some people use `` kijowo '' changing the root from `` dick '' to `` stick/bat/rod '' , so that it sounds similar , but is not a dirty word anymore :p, 
  at all kinds of schools : from about a week before june ends ( this year : 23th of june ) to the end of august . 
  on the 1st of september school term starts . 
  at unis - from about mid june ( depends ) to the end of september , term starts everywhere at 1st of october . 
  not only * bravo !, 
  * but also * thank you !, 
  * i have learned a lot of new words from posts here . 
  yes , i 'm very strange because i looked up `` discount '' and `` supermarket '' in wikipedia to find the difference and wrote about that . 
  i know you do n't use `` store '' . 
  yeah , we shall and change each `` store '' word in wikipedia or complain that they do n't have british english and american english separated . 
  i know people do n't use `` variety shop '' - i wrote that just to share information . 
  i 'm new in the internet and did n't know it was forbidden forgive me . 
  looked up and iceland is simply a supermarket . 
  from the [ list of supermarket chains in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_supermarket_chains_in_the_united_kingdom ) , lidl , netto and aldi are * discount * supermarket chains . 
  and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_discount_stores_in_the_united_kingdom ) is a list of discount chain stores in the uk ( without discount supermarkets ) . 
  i also found out that `` poundlands '' , `` euroshops '' etc. 
  are called [ variety stores ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/variety_store ) . 
  i would call * discounts * poundland , poundshop etc. 
  and iceland . 
  depends where you go , some are not easy to spot . 
  maybe [ carpathian newts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpathian_newt ) , [ european green lizard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_green_lizard ) , [ aesculapian snake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesculapian_snake ) , [ european ground squirrel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_ground_squirrel ) . 
  in poland there are plenty of [ roe deers ] ( http://kanal99.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sarny.jpg ) , [ white storks ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=dziki+w+mie%c5%9bcie&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewitsby6mtztahvll1akhs9kaxyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=615#tbm=isch&amp;q=bociany+w+polsce+zdjecia ) and [ wild boars ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=dziki+w+mie%c5%9bcie&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewitsby6mtztahvll1akhs9kaxyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=615 ) . 
  i have some sausages from boar 's and roe deer 's meat . 
  you can find european bison in the reserves . 
  i took [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xx5424c.jpg ) of young one in the reserve by baltic sea three years ago . 
  well , you say hedgehog is unique ... sounds strange to me , so i 'm not sure if my post is helpful . 
  i have found following around the net , the things which foreigners found weird . 
  i do n't know how much they are really unique , so feel free to correct me : * sharing communion wafer with others during christmas eve ( but i think lithuanians practice that too ) ; * christmas call - priests coming to everybody 's flat/house around christmas ( of course you may not let them in ) ; * tripe soup and [ duck blood soup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czernina ) ; * you can make window kind of ajar if you rotate the handle by 180 ^ o like [ here ] ( http://budowniczy.tyma.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/okno123.jpg ) or [ here ] ( http://static.e-izolacje.pl/articles/4700_izolacje-zdjecia_1_jpg_artykul-zdjecia-okno-uchylone.jpg?0 ) , usually you can also unseal it rotating the handle by 135 ^ o ; * windbreaks frenzy on the beach - [ look at photos here ] ( http://www.rewal.com/atrakcje/plaza-za-parawanem-czyli-nadbaltycki-trend-wsrod-plazowiczow-1426 ) - no , we do n't have strong winds by baltic , it 's kind of * booking * your space on the beach , starting every day from 5-6 am ; * flashing hazard lights at other driver as `` thank you '' ; * at the train stations they tell you number of platform and number of train line which are different , and it confused some foreigners , like `` platform 1 line 501 '' ; * drinking coffee in mugs/glasses especially at home , not always in coffee cups ; * eating pizza with ketchup ; * very few movies have dubbing ( shrek , finding nemo etc. 
  for kids ) , usually all movie is read by one person ; * kids have to change shoes in schools . 
  here you can find them often with frosting and crumbles . 
  and i 'd like to add : because there was lack of different goods , people were commonly doing more things on their own , like clothes , toys , preserves etc. 
  to diversify them , as in the stores the choice was limited , when it comes to varying kinds of something and design/aesthetics . 
  the only one that comes to my mind : `` dno i kilometr mu\u0142u '' literally : the bottom and one kilometer of mud ( one kilometer of mud beneath the bottom = lower than the lowest point + mud as equivalent of * crap * ) common ( i even saw such hashtag ) comment on something pitiful , embarrassing , ridiculous , bringing shame on people who did it ( i.e. 
  on politicians ' or celebs ' words or deeds , movies , restaurants etc. ), 
  to express deprecation ; maybe * ( it hits ) the rock bottom * is relevant ? 
  if people want to put an extra emphasis on how bad something was , they may add * wodorosty * = * seaweed * or add more kilometers of mud . 
  we have it here , but i think it 's much less popular than trade schools . 
  not so popular , but you can still have it , even in chain stores like kaufland . 
   your nationality wo n't ever offend anyone abroad because your country is so insignificant in the world affairs . 
  that 's very true . 
  my dad has both british and polish citizenship - he always uses polish passport as brits are often disliked in many countries . 
  many people miss the feeling of the steadiness of social life , jobs etc. , people knew what to expect from the state . 
  though many things were shitty , they learnt how to deal with them . 
  they say nowadays everything is changing too fast and seem unstable . 
  i wish i had lived then so as to see the difference from my own perspective . 
  i 've always heard that poland was treated quite good in comparison to other soviet states . 
  i do n't like the haters of communism times , i think they exaggerate `` how bad it was '' when it comes to everyday life . 
  well , and mind that people tend to sentimentalise `` good old times '' . 
  it was an opportunity to gain the independence back . 
  november 11th ( of the 1918 ) is the independence day . 
  poland did n't exist as a country in 1795 - 1918 period , it was divided into three partitions ruled by different countries . 
  when war broke out in 1914 some political groups saw different paths to independence . 
  all three partitioners promised the poles independence if they brought their side to victory as they needed soldiers . 
  independent paramilitary groups pledged temporary allegiance to one state or another , like pi\u0142sudski 's polish legion fought for austro-hungary and blue army was in france . 
  many poles joined polish-only or regular regiments in the regular armies of the partitioners . 
  the area of poland served as battlefield though . 
   also the thing about investing in eastern poland i know it 's an old thread , but i had no idea about those ads and they made me laugh , 
  everything is from catholic point of view , afaik . 
  i think they may point a differences between religions within christianity and why they are considered a deviations from catholic beliefs . 
  i bet they have very little knowledge about non-christians and it is not taught during those classes . 
  well , i edited the question to clarify as i see it may have not been obvious how it looks like here . 
  the teacher here is usually a priest or a nun , they are designated by bishops to teach at schools , so they have education about catholic dogmas and rite . 
  prayers are part of that . 
  here it used to be ( and actually is ) picked up by many people , who want religion classes ( as how they are now ) back to churches/presbyteries , as it would take place in your free time - it used to be like that in communism times . 
  religion in schools was introduced when communism broke , in 1989 . 
  the church demanded it publicly , and current pm agreed as he was afraid to loose the election . 
  yeah , that 's similar . 
  here a teacher is also chosen by church , to be specific - by a diocesan bishop . 
  i just had '' -- '' in the place for religion grade . 
  but the whole situation seems a bit similar . 
  here the ethics became more popular i think maybe after 2008 or 2009 ( ? 
  ) , i presume especially in major cities . 
  though i come from one , there were not many kids like me , it was strange for others that a person does n't attend religion classes . 
  like they had no idea that somebody may not be catholic , 
   what do you do in religion classes ? 
  for how many years ? 
  for the whole education , which is usually 12 years , 2 classes every week . 
  i 'm not a catholic , i was only on a few lessons accidentally . 
  classes start and end with prayer , are about dogmas , stories from bible , some saints . 
  maybe some other person would give you more details . 
  mind that everything depends on a teacher . 
  for your * introduction to social sciences * i think our * knowledge about society * may be similar . 
  it was about how the state works , how eu works , some law stuff , wars , social problems etc. , also about other religions , which were mentioned at history lessons , too . 
  i would say 2-4 lessons altogether maybe . 
  ethics ? 
  it depends on a teacher , who are not easy to find . 
  mine was a woman , who taught biology , but she also graduated philosophy . 
  there were not many people , we had the list of issues , which we wanted to talk about , suggested by us and by the teacher . 
  every week we were about to talk about two of them in group discussion . 
  at the beginning one student or our teacher made an introduction to the topic ( they had to prepare to it at home ) . 
  topics were i.e. 
  modern art , world problems , social problems , `` mercy killing '' , minor wars which are n't talked about in the media , philosophies , other cultures often exotic , ideologies and so on . 
   but of course you could put that stuff in history classes or something . 
  actually , we had that stuff in history and `` wos '' ( literally * knowledge about society * ) classes . 
  religion is all about catholics , classes start and end with prayers etc. 
  you 're right . 
  i think it depends where you live and on the school itself .
