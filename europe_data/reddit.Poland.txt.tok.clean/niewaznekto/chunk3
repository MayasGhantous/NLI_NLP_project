  my mom persisted on the issue though . 
  i 'm not a catholic , so i ca n't say how they looked like . 
  i heard that they were kind of free , but it really depends on a teacher . 
  in my high school there was a conventual , who looked very seriously , never smiled ( well , priests are usually those `` cool teachers '' afaik ) and people said he was very demanding , they had regular tests and needed to write essays . 
  people use it usually privately in groups , afaik . 
  use for medical purposes was legalized this year , though there is no refund for such medications and also some other conditions . 
  growing and recreational use is prohibited , but now there is no push for legalization . 
  in my opinion most people call them junkies and marijuana a drug , others do n't think it 's a drug really . 
  really , depends on who you meet . 
  i met many people who have smoked at least once , i was surprised there were so many of them . 
  i think people just smoke , but do n't know , i 'm not into it . 
   dostat kopa\u010dky czech is so funny  we also have `` dosta\u0107 kosza '' ( be given a basket ) for * have been turned down * by somebody . 
  not really , not the way you mean them . 
  food from truck you may find in summer by the sea or in other tourist destinations , selling fast foods or ice creams . 
  i think there may be probably a few of them preparing some good food in warsaw , cracow and other bigger cities , but it 's rare . 
  restaurants and bars - as others wrote below . 
  gas stations are usually open 24/7 , but they are expensive . 
  if we talk about cities , some private entrepreneurs ' stores - usually they have mainly alcohol and less of other supplies and some of tesco/carrefour stores are open 24/7 . 
  most of the chain convenience stores are open from 6-7 to 21-22 in the workdays and in the weekends 8-20 probably , it really depends . 
  private entrepreneurs set their own rules , it 's hard to generalize . 
  franchise chains are quite common and such as \u017babka or freshmarket are open 6-23 seven days a week . 
  during holidays some local solopreneurs usually have their shops open , too . 
   is there a time of day or week when pretty much everything is closed ? 
  if you live in a big city , not in the suburbs - no . 
  i do n't know what 's popular but very easy and quick meals i eat : * buckwheat/millet/spelt groats/pearl barley etc. 
  with fried onion * cooked potatoes with sour cream and fried onion * corn grits with raisins and some honey and not so quick , but also easy : * lecs\u00f3 ( kind of , i just use what i have ) * barley soup * zalewajka - kind of potato soup ; based on sour soup and with onion, 
  * most of the food from middle east , pakistan , bangladesh , india , love the seasonings they use * japanese okonomiyaki * pelmeni , known in europe , but they originate from siberia, 
   i can see one doing very well in london . 
  could you post an address , please ? 
  and q , x , v appear only in loan words . 
  thanks , actually i think yours was worse  i mean as far as i know , both sweden and russia wanted the land , which is strategic location . 
  they were rather powerful countries and there were less finish than polish people , who could fight for the country . 
  that 's why you people were very brave . 
  though in school i learned only about the winter war and simo hayha , when it comes to finland . 
  well , i think it refers to any country and any war  there are not many random people who would like to kill other random people . 
  only some psychos , i think . 
  i lived in london for a time , so i would only refer to this place . 
  i missed : * food , mostly dairy and sour , yet there are polish shops , so you can actually get some of the stuff you want ; * bread ; well , you may find some good one , but it 's very expensive then ; * sour cherries ; they only had sweet cherries ; * wild strawberries ; * common bilberries / blue whortleberries - not sure how you call them but i mean [ those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_myrtillus ) ; * mushrooms and mushroom picking ; there were no fresh mushrooms of different species ; * one tap for cold and hot water ; and the tap water sucks ; * grey toilet paper !, 
  - really annoying ; i could n't find it anywhere , but damn , toilet paper must be a bit rough for what it is used !, 
  * dogs ; there are less people with dogs and dogs need to be well-trained , obedient etc , and are not so spontaneous , they seemed rather reserved ; i really like dogs and they usually like me , but those were not communicative and open with people , as i was used to . 
  what about the erd\u00e9ly ? 
  is n't that those who live there have beef with the romanian ? 
  i read the history of finland ( not on wikipedia , some short book ) and i remember that you were in horrible situation for all those years between sweden and russia . 
  i was pretty shocked and sorry for your country , and at the same time it was amazing that you got over it . 
  i do n't keep any grudges , i just hear them around from time to time and wanted to know how about your countries . 
  i agree it 's the same everywhere with capitals , and warsaw is the main city of poor and weakly developed voivodship . 
  i myself do n't hate any of those countries , really . 
  i mentioned what are some common regrets , but it all depends on people you meet . 
  some are nationalists , but some are not , they just care about the history , but rather do n't hate random people . 
  thanks !, 
  i had no idea there is so much rivalry between those cities . 
   there is also minor resentment between london/south east england and the rest of the uk . 
  i have lived in london for a time , and i heard that it 's kind of separated island within uk , that if you 've lived in london then you know nothing about real english people and the country . 
  poland has about 38\u00a0000\u00a0000 people , while number of people speaking romani is 35 000 ( officially only half of that admit romani nationality ) , so it 's about 1 % . 
  it 's much less than in czech , slovakia , romania , hungary ... as i have never lived in area where there are lots of gypsies , i did n't mention that . 
  but sure , they are a problem , i have heard a lot of creepy stories about them . 
  i lived in fulham , which is just the opposite side of thames and i would say battersea is definitely good area , easy access to the riverside and i would say also to the center of london . 
  i think it is generally safe , yet i 'm not a female and did n't go there at night  i do n't think there are many poor people living there , i think it is rather expensive . 
  quiet - depends whether you live next to the pub/restaurant etc. , the exact location . 
  generally - cool . 
  from germany , they were adjudged internationally as being guilty for the ww2 and had to pay war reparations to other countries . 
  all the damages have been priced here for the government a few times since communism collapsed . 
  but well , there are lots of law issues around that case , i 'm not good at international law though . 
  all in all , the fact is the ww2 reparations have never been paid . 
  some people here think our gov should n't rise this as `` relations with germany would become colder , we would be ignored at political arena '' or `` it has been long time ago , why should we bother '' and so on . 
  which i bet sounds shit to an average pole , as they do n't care about international diplomacy stuff . 
  we were quite damaged and a few millions died , so reparations seem just like an obvious thing . 
  btw : i have nothing against german people or something . 
   trumps love of putin also begs the question of why since this seems in response to russia it was set during [ 2016 nato summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_warsaw_summit ) , when obama was us president . 
  i do n't know how all this president stuff works , but if it had been set before , then it probably had to be done anyway . 
  nope , reddit people wo n't solve that . 
  the reparations just crossed my mind when some people on youtube said about us army : `` we wish they were here during ww2 '' . 
  the exercises are common , but now they are to improve the east flank of nato in estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland and romania . 
  i looked up that some peter doran from center for european policy analysis said that 's because russia had annexed the part of ukraine . 
  and by the numbers given by the media you can see , that these are some * bigger exercises * . 
  i do n't know , i found that bison , gepard , dragon i saber guardian are the code names for those maneuvers , they along with polish soldiers , there are armored brigade combat team there , and some military helicopters group would arrive , too . 
  and russian soldiers came to belarus for zapad ( ? ), 
  maneuvers or something about the time . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qxgg5cpeg ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v1jmlg6fss ) you have videos and that is piece from [ euronews ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjddx5x1wbo ) in english . 
  i saw the troops and all army stuff on the road , as well as american soldiers in the city , so did my brother in another . 
  there are some videos when casual people talk with them . 
  many people get pissed off like * get the fuck out you murderers * , * we do n't want serbia and libya here * , any foreign soldiers are not welcome so to say ( except maybe hungarian ) and so on . 
  many are happy - including our government , saying they feel save and it 's historical moment , as there were n't so many us army stuff here since cold war and wish they were here during ww2 and so on . 
  btw : we have n't been paid any war reparations after ww2 , does n't that sound strange ? 
  of course we have learned the wright brothers were the first . 
  poland gained independence back in 1918 , so first poles who flew were in russian in french airborne units . 
  the most famous polish pilots are f. [ \u017bwirko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franciszek_%c5%bbwirko ) and s. [ wigura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_wigura ) , who won the international `` challenge '' air contest in 1932 . 
  there are streets , schools etc. 
  named after them . 
  and there are those famous pilots from polish air forces in france and great britain during ww2 . 
   we do keep them all singular and we have them plural , except 1 km , 1 kg etc. 
  of course . 
  i do n't think we have any . 
  of course `` oh , my god '' , `` jesus christ '' , `` saint mary '' etc. 
  but they do n't count . 
  well , maybe according to first commandment catholic people should n't do that , yet that 's not a blasphemy . 
  the words `` god '' , `` christ '' , `` virgin mary '' are never used in blasphemy expressions . 
  it would sound very very strange in polish language to me , putting words meaning ~ `` fuck '' next to `` jesus '' , `` god '' etc. 
  i got used to it in english though , but i do n't use such expressions . 
  same as i wo n't use `` muhammad fuckin allah '' or so ... btw : i 'm not catholic , not even baptised .
