  not a band , but of all time : [ charles aznavour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_aznavour ) , `` france 's frank sinatra '' . 
  you have castles . 
  americans do n't , 
  could you share how your views on usa change after the visit ? 
  i think the facebook page of [ polisz arkitekczer ] ( https://www.facebook.com/polisz.arkitekczer/ ) is relevant . 
  they mostly point kitschy/ugly/strange etc. 
  buildings in poland . 
  lots of photos there . 
  yet we have n't coined any equivalent ironic expression in our language . 
  what `` dating in american sense '' / `` american date culture '' means ? 
  for origin of polish * niemcy * there are two theories : from the tribe of [ nemetes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nemetes ) or from joint words * niemy * = speechless , meaning they did n't understand our language + * obcy * = outlander , stranger - because of the language barrier they could n't communicate . 
  in the middle ages people from the carpathians speaking german were called `` g\u0142ucho * niemcy * '' , which means `` deaf-mute '' / `` deaf without speech '' from the same reason . 
  and maybe after some time it has shortened to * niemcy * . 
  in other slavic languages the origin is probably similar , connected with `` mute '' meaning , and in hungarian language they borrowed the slavic root for * n\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g * . 
  i wear mostly second-hand clothes , but popular polish brands selling casual clothes and having many stores in the country are : * from lpp group : house , reserved , mohito , cropp , sinsay * carry * tatuum * diverse * monnari - for women * 4f - athletic wear when it comes to fashion , patriotic wear is quite popular among some young people these days . 
  i am surprised you have n't mentioned budapest . 
  if you 're already in that area , you should visit krak\u00f3w / cracow and/or wroc\u0142aw maybe . 
  anyway , poland  [ here ] ( http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm ) you will find very cheap tickets ( `` first minute '' sale ) , there is a bus stop map - connections cover poland mainly , but also germany , prague , brno , bratislava , vienna and budapest . 
  i travel with them a lot regularly and there are always many tourists in the coach . 
  not many words from polish . 
  there are many loan words in other slavic languages , yet it 's hard to track their certain origin . 
  polish language had strong language/culture impact in the slavic area in 16th and 17th century . 
  i made some research for loan words and found those listed below . 
  of course i do n't know whether they are actually used or not , most refers to specialized fields , so probably are not used everyday and well-known : * * polonium * - chemical element ; * * ogonek * - word for a diacritic hook ; you can find it i.e. 
  english , german , french , italian , portugese ; * * spruce * is from polish * z prus * ( `` from prussia '' ) , which sounded like `` spruce '' to english speakers ; from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spruce ) : `` it became spruce because the tree was believed to have come from polish ducal prussia '' ; * * rendzina * , type of soil , is from polish * r\u0119dzina * , used i.e. 
  in italian , german , turkish , english ; * * mazurka * , musical form is from polish * mazurek * ; used in many languages ; * * czech * - [ dictionary ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/czech ) says : * origin : polish spelling of czech \u010cech * ; * obviously names of polish dishes : * pierogi * , * kie\u0142basa * , * bigos * , * p\u0105czki * etc ; * and the word * vitamin * was coined by polish biochemist kazimierz funk . 
  in german : * * gurke * - from polish * og\u00f3rek * , well the root is from medieval greek , so it rather came through polish * * dalli , dalli !, 
  * from * dalej !, 
  * * * einen pitschen * from * pi\u0107 * = drink * names of some animals , like * peitzker * ( piskorz = scab ) , * zeisig * ( czy\u017cyk = siskin ) , * stieglitz * ( szczygie\u0142 = goldfinch ), 
  same here in poland i think . 
  and most of them are students/young people . 
  but i had a neighbour in her 70ties , whom sister 's daughter married some african man ( they have a son ) and this neighbour has broken off her contacts with that couple and did n't want to take part in the baby 's baptism . 
  that 's just an example , sad though . 
  ok , i did n't know that . 
  we have them as `` gytia '' , `` warwa '' ( and `` dy '' is `` dy '' ) in polish , but i would say they are rather used in geological meaning . 
  and i think the english ones too . 
  i know angstrom as a unit , but used to determine ion radius , so not useful in everyday life . 
  `` tungsten '' is the word i like , because in polish `` tungsten '' is dated , i 've never heard it , it 's `` wolfram '' , completely different word with latin origin . 
  to me the above seem kind of scientific  from your list in english , i have only come across `` lingonberry '' , `` ombudsman '' , `` moped '' and `` orienteering '' . 
  yes , people wear and buy them , hand-me-downs are also quite common i think , used to wear them as a child . 
  now , as an adult i wear almost only second-hand clothes and shoes . 
  i 'm really unfussy when it comes to clothes . 
  i just want them to be of good quality , good looking = not distinctive , casual , and reasonably cheap . 
   can people be picked on for it ? 
  i have never experienced that , it seems strange to care about where others buy their clothes ... 
  so as to be picked on , i would have to tell somebody , where i have bought mine - i ca n't see a reason , why would i do so ... 
  i have never been asked such question . 
  i have never heard people saying russian ( or who exactly ) did this . 
  the fact is we do n't know what really happened , yet somebody is responsible for that , so people would blame anybody . 
  in the past some communists visiting ussr , came back to poland simply in welded coffin , that 's why perhaps russia comes to mind first . 
  if anyone thinks there are no loan words from their language , check the names of minerals or variations of rocks :-), 
  if you have `` gyttja '' and `` varve '' , then there should be also `` dy '' . 
  well , i think that we should n't get bogged down in the scientific language so much , there are plenty of foreign loan words , but most of us do n't know them nor use them in everyday language , 
  thanks for the \u0440\u0443\u0441\u044b\u0439 expression , i did n't know it . 
  yes , it was in polish , so maybe that 's the matter of translation . 
  well , i am kind of a fan of russian literature , the golden age mainly ( but also some late things ) - i have read plenty of works , so it 's quite hard to recall from which one this sentence comes ... as far as i remember , it referred to some polish military detachment ( ? ), 
  or just group of soldiers , where boys/men varied in age and so that also in shade of blonde ; it was n't important anyhow for the plot , just appeared in one of many descriptions . 
  now i think that it 's more likely to be in `` doctor zhivago '' than `` war and peace '' though . 
  btw imho `` doctor zhivago '' is one of the top of all i 've read , if not the best , 
  has something happened to eszett ? 
  if yes , i am seriously surprised . 
  i did n't know , always thought that us demography is generally good , i mean you are young society ... actually , our current government has some change proposal , yet for now nothing is for sure or commonly discussed in the media . 
  what has been recently done - retirement age has been reduced to 60 for women and to 65 for men . 
  donald tusk , current president of the european council , previously raised it to 67 for both men and women in 2012 . 
  there is also act of decommunization of the pensions ' privileges for people who worked in communists `` machinery of repress '' , and their families . 
  those money used to be relatively big , while those people 's work/career are considered to be of `` bad reputation '' , they served in totalist system . 
  that 's all for now , they plan to cut down pensions privileges also for uniformed services , judiciary and farmers but for that they will surely meet resistance from those groups . 
  in poland i think it 's zus - social insurance institution . 
  it 's actually a financial pyramid , but as opposed to them , it 's mandatory , you have to participate under penalty , there is no written arrangement , you ca n't withdraw your contribution , contribution ca n't be inherited , if they change some rules or refuse to pay , you can do nothing etc. 
  sometimes people have problems with getting their benefits and zus itself is very bureaucratic . 
  of course that system is limited by demography - there would be more elder people and less young/workers , who would pay for pensions of the elderly - so we expect to have shoestring retirement pensions in the future . 
  the dues are relatively big , so most people feel like they just `` lose '' about 1/3 of their salary . 
  well , it 's kind of complicated and i do n't feel like the right person to explain that . 
  but i think we generally agree this should be reorganized . 
  yet everybody looks the other way as there seem to be no good solution . 
  at least you have some clear law and medical procedures about transition in the uk ... 
  in poland it is a chaos , which of course causes malpractice . 
  but the topic has been associated with lefties , so even if it should be objectively solved , the rightists who are in power wo n't touch it . 
  it would stay crap for a long time probably . 
  do you really hate us so much as the media says ? 
  in my opinion it 's rude generally , everywhere . 
  i will probably never asked about that without a serious reason . 
   most kids got blonde hair , but they darken with age . 
  in some russian novel - `` war and peace '' maybe , but not sure - it was described as `` polish blonde '' . 
  i know many young people who go to church regularly , they sing in chorus , go on pilgrimages and so on . 
  i do n't treat them differently . 
  i do n't think about them differently . 
  they do n't harm anybody , it 's their life , none of my business  wish them good luck . 
  totally agree . 
  and some people do n't treat it like a cemetery , rather like a museum , taking selfies and so on , which i find quite inappropriate . 
  death camps are not supposed to be `` fancy and cool '' ... 
  i usually used to hear tattoos are `` prison fashion '' , so nothing positive ... and i do n't like them , would n't like to have one . 
  especially on girls/women they look very strange ( not nice ) for me . 
  i have also read that there are no regulations about chemical components of inks , we do n't know what 's inside them , and tattooists may use some dyes for cars or other unknown s.h.i.t ; i would advise you to ask about that , if you want a tattoo for yourself . 
   german toilets have shelves so you can inspect feces before flushing ? 
  i think there are simply those two types of toilets : with and without shelf . 
  in poland i happened to rent a room in many places and i think more than a half of them there were shelves . 
  but i.e. 
  my grandma does n't like it , so she bought a toilet without shelf . 
  so i do n't think it 's german thing .
