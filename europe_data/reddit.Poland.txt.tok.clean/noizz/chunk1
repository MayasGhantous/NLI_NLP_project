check smaller bakeries , a lot are still around and they do proper , tasty bread instead of baking the deep frozen thing available in bigger stores . 
  it might be a local thing , but i noticed the same shift that happened to beer a few years ago - `` craft bread '' seems to be more available and there are more choices . 
  yet waaaaay more spot on than `` dziobak '' . 
   luckily * fasten your seatbelt beep from hell * took over . 
  ftfy . 
  fuel prices . 
  the smear job , that bbc did before the event , painted both countries as run solely by football hooligans and that the whole gig as death camp for foreigners . 
  was it really that bad in the end ? 
  speaking of metal - [ nargaroth ist krieg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjlbwbgyjy ) !, 
  naah , that 's not crime , it 's just affluenza . 
  exactly this . 
  healthy and strong ukraine equals less chance of an unexpected knife in the back from the big brother on the east . 
  besides - i 've heard crimea 's kinda great summer destination . 
  no worries , [ next one will be glorious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/grboijp.jpg ) . 
  i find it interesting when countries get their own typefaces , but i am struggling to like this one , it kinda looks as if din went to fight futura for who 's the most geometric one . 
  regardless of my views - if you guys can * keep it consistent * it might look great and give you a huge advantage over countries switching whole identities every so often for no apparent reason . 
  too late , already been to . 
  same as the m&m 's - like candy , but i ca n't remember the name now . 
   12 - 3 + months of unpaid internship ftfy, 
   the origins of poland i love this part the most . 
  it 's like bible 's book of genesis - `` first there was nothing . 
  then czechs sent some peasant king a gift of christianity along with a busty wench and it was good . 
  that 'd be it . '', 
  just as if nothing existed before 966 or `` the gift of christianity '' was so great that everyone embraced it on a whim . 
  traumatizing them fo ' life !, 
   it 's been ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 2 days since last walesa `` saying something without thinking '' accident . 
  i highly doubt that the generation that hit uk recently is very religious . 
  out of 50 guys/gals i know maybe 5 are of the `` church-going type religious '' and i am not even sure if they continue religious practices outside of their parent 's eyesight . 
  but my sample size is n't very representative . 
  not really , it 's just a recurring joke here in pl and this was first link in english . 
  glad that foreigners remember that tho . 
  i guess no more speeding tickets for [ mr. prawo jazdy ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7899171.stm ) . 
  sucks :(, 
   motorway that does not fill all criterias of proper motorway in poland it means that they have n't been able to setup toll booths yet . 
  people speculate that it might be rigged with hard to detect mines and other deathtraps . 
  also - there is a huge forest fire nearby , i wonder if it 's related . 
  how about romania ? 
  not very recent , but they let their ceausescus go with a bang and they 've been doing pretty well . 
   t\u00dcv statistics do not lie ignorance is bliss . 
  that 's some impressive forward thinking to name a region so it works as a car brand too !, 
  and yet 50 % of the streets in every city are named after russian scientists , like gazov , ogrodov , kwiatov , etc , 
  the fanpage is n't calling to `` shoot all faggots '' , but to `` fuck rainbow profiles '' . 
  not sure if romantically or not . 
  no idea how extreme that profile was , but there are similar profiles like that every time something gets facebook ( or social media ) popular - you get people that are in `` fuck this particular fad '' mode , regardless whether it 's lgbt support , the pope , beer manufacturer creating branded country flags , drugs or politicians doing something crazy . 
  i was under impression it was en vogue during presidency of our late president . 
  that was funny as hell when politicians had to sweat out explanations of roman salute all the time :d, 
  whyyyy ? 
  are you still having winter ? 
  he will remove personal income tax , limit government involvement in economy , ban voting rights of everyone on government payroll and without jobs , limit bureaucracy and so on . 
  although , the legend is n't clear when it will happen . 
  the king himself in european parliament : http://i.imgur.com/0k4v3ve.jpg, 
  ranking seems to be quite reliable in terms of mainstream computer usage . 
  operating systems stats : http://i.imgur.com/dclqdfd.png mind you that it 's for popular sites , number of hits is in billions , but every conscious web user has their spyware blocked , so it might be skewed ... 
  unfortunately that is exactly the case . 
   astral wanker made my day . 
  it 's a '' [ hosts ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hosts ) '' file . 
  a text file with domain names and ip pairs . 
  an easy way to block or redirect certain domains ( websites ) on you personal computer . 
  thin air so far . 
  but it was the case when i was invited for the last tour when the service was mandatory . 
  same thing with having a difficult family situation . 
  you could petition for a delayed service or even no service at all , but it was on a per case basis . 
  answer to my inquiry was more like `` ze mozerland doez n't care about your obligationz , stalker '' . 
  i 've seen early reports that if you hire people you might be able to skip this recruitment . 
  you 're still fucked if you are a sole trader . 
  you get a different mcjob on umowa \u015bmieciowa . 
  it was n't worth much in the first place anyway . 
  same here . 
  unfortunately this screenshot is from just cause 3 . 
  uhm , wrong thread ? 
  might be . 
  but everything in the folder spelled luxury and shit seriously looked like paradise . 
  i wish i remembered what this island was tho :(, 
  i am unsure how `` exactly '' those programs work or what are the requirements for government to allow it , but i saw renderings of [ hollywood ] ( http://www.hollywoodcirclefl.com/ ) 's regional center and i read that fl is a super popular destination among chinese people ( 70 % or so ) , so there are more sites for sure . 
  i also saw a few eb-5 resort offers on smaller islands , but i always had a cognitive dissonance whenever someone talks about helping poor local areas boost employment and they offer an investment in almost a paradise like location next to a golf course . 
  kinda opposite of usual poverty stricken or underdeveloped eu regions that get special economic treatment . 
  this is correct . 
  even usa has such programs , one of the most popular is the eb-5 . 
  it requires an investment of $ 500k + and there are plenty of interesting opportunities ( hotels , resorts , so on ) , even in popular locations like florida 's south beach . 
  i just thought i 'd take a glance without proper eye protection and now i can barely see . 
  thank you internet . 
   if you really want to get down to it . 
  the largest part of prussia/east germany that got destroyed and ethnically cleansed is now in poland . 
  it all depends how far back in history you are willing to go - because the whole region changed ownership quite a lot . 
  can you elaborate about the other worries ? 
  was n't there an initiative to change czech republic name to czechia ? 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://www.czechia-initiative.com/ ) . 
  does n't seem very active tho . 
  sorry , too busy vandalizing sitting benches . 
  | a ** e ** rial ftfy . 
  video looks cool tho , thanks for sharing . 
  this is crazy steep . 
  i bet strava people wage total wars over king of the mountain achievement there . 
  not sure what your definition of `` full of '' is , but according to wikipedia - 11 high ranked military died , 4 of them with `` church related '' ranks/duties . 
  regardless , way too many important people on one plane . 
  sooo - blue oyster bar then ? 
  prolly a tea flavored big gulp of sugar water . 
  there is n't much in terms of negative feedback in the media , some minor drunk cases or waving upa flags , but nothing serious . 
  i 've heard old people complain or tell horror stories , but all i 've seen so far are hard working ukrainians doing jobs that poles hate ( delivery couriers , warehouse staff , graveyard shifts , all the usual minimum wage fun ) . 
  pretty much same thing as in uk - natives complaining about foreigners stealing their jobs , while at the same time - not wanting to work at any of them .
