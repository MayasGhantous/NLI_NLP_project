  i sadly do n't know much about your country except that it has some beautiful , green landscapes . 
  could i ask you to recommend a blog / site where i could learn something about macedonia ? 
  maybe a set of pictures with comments attached to them ? 
  or a fabular movie made in your country ? 
  it 's just that we live in relatively close cultures , but i do n't know anything about your country , society and culture . 
  and it does n't seem i could go visit macedonia or any country anytime soon . 
  i have a feeling that people outside of poland do n't understand your joke and they really think you 're referencing to some catholic saint . 
  if it was up to you to pick new name for macedonia , what would you choose ? 
  do you have any type ? 
  damn , i had read this comment before looking at the map and i had thought i missed international balkan meme conference 2015 , but then i saw the glorious t\u00fcrktan\u011fle . 
  as / u/boavida said , it 's putting penis between breasts . 
  honestly i thought that this term is commonly used throughout whole western world , the same as with '' french sex '' . 
  additionaly '' bi\u0107 niemca po kasku '' ( '' beat german on his helmet '' ) , means , well , that you can propably easily figure out . 
  funny thing , in polish '' robi\u0107 hiszpana '' ( '' making / doing spaniard '' ) is solely related to one specific sexual act . 
   there 's some obvious anime inspirations ( ghost in the shell , etc. ), 
  i would n't call putting one show 's poster as a inspiration , it 's the same as with the movie whiplash , just because character says some famous drummer 's name it 's not inspiration , just a wink . 
   other than that , the overall effect is ... mediocre . 
  as it was with ambition , bagi\u0144ski is unable to make a convincing live-action piece without wooden acting and overdone effects . 
  imo he should stick with cgi . 
  live action is not his thing . 
  mediocre ? 
  it is what is , nicely crafted modernized version of famous tale . 
  and for what it is , i like it . 
  i sense some heavy finnish memes . 
  i 'd like to move to another country before turning 30 , i love my city , but i would n't want to spend my whole life in one city / country . 
  i have narrowed my selection to 4 countries and portugal is one of them , although i was never in your country . 
  it just seems to be a peaceful and kind place with warm climat . 
  hey , dear american !, 
   you 'd think they would open another register since there are 10 of us waiting . 
  if you would tell me that while standing in a queue , i 'd propably think a ) you 're insane person that says random things to random people ; b ) you 're relict of iron curtain times and you feel the constant need to bitch about something publicly ; c ) you 're a creep ; d ) you want to steal something from me , or scam me ; e ) or just i 'd be annoyed that some guy had to bother me . 
  then i would say something like '' yeah , yeah '' maybe even '' yeah , yeah , they could '' on a happy day and immediately look other way and pretend you do n't exist . 
  i 'd like to visit usa someday , but a thought of faking these small talks and smiles there seems like something that would bother me and propably majority of family and friends . 
  but on the other hand i must say that some time ago i met one american while waiting in a drug store , it was a long wait because they had to fix cash register or something , after like 30 seconds we were talking about what a bummer this situation is , after 2 minutes about food in poland in us and having a laugh , after 4 minutes about our families , and after 6 minutes he was telling me about his experience during wtc incident in 2001 . 
  i mean , maybe it was just him or maybe this stereotpye is true and y' all are just a bunch of happy , friendly folks . 
   ironically and refreshingly , authors who make fun of nationalism also become objects for national pride , like witold gombrowicz if you would ask typical polish patriot or '' patriot '' ( sometimes i do n't see a distinction anymore ) about gombrowicz , the reaction would be rather aggressive , disdainful and maybe even homophobic . 
  poland has in general a large problem with nationalism , racism and basically hatred for everyone who is n't white , european , right-winged , christian or atheist , and straight . 
  i 'll give you two examples . 
  first , recently in pozna\u0144 media reported that a syrian man assaulted a woman . 
  later it turned out , that he did n't assault a woman , but a group of few men , and did n't assault , but was beaten by them because of his skin colour . 
  second , i deal with such people everyday , i had many occurrences when someone i talked a lot with in college or in work seemed like a cool guy / girl , but only until you talk about weather / movies / work , as soon as politics turn up , your tipical pole will wipe out his or her racism and casually smack it into your face . 
  and i know that in every country there are some racist , hatefull people , but after living in poland for a while now , it seems that here majority of people are . 
  antoni macierewicz will be the minister of national defence in poland 's new government . 
  i 'm aware that tells nothing to anyone outside of poland , but well ... 
  it 's not going to be that much of hyperbole if i call this man a psycho . 
  it 's just very bad news . 
  thank you for this comment , whenever there is political discussion amongst poles on reddit , this issue shows up . 
  many people in poland think that everything that is n't some '' anarcho-libertarianism '' is socialism . 
  i have no idea if what you wrote is true or a joke , but you made me cry of laughter . 
  thank you . 
  i think i 'd feel comfortable in latvia . 
  also i dig your flair 's description . 
  '' neoliberal '' does n't mean you do n't pay taxes . 
  funny thing is that everytime it shows up on this sub , only people from poland do n't understand what liberalism is . 
  practically flat income tax rate in poland is as liberal as it can get . 
  eastern europe is pretty neoliberal , i do n't know about other countries , but in poland both someone who earns minimal wage and someone who earns 10 000 euro pays the same income tax . 
  i have yet to meet a pole not from warsaw who 's opinion about the capital is this optimistic . 
  this . 
  the reason i believe that russia will bother my country in a few decades is the same one that makes me expect that sun will rise in the morning . 
  during my lifetime , yes . 
  i honestly believe their goal is the fall of eu and nato , after which they would be free to conquer poland , baltic states or finland . 
  only times i see this is women complementing each other , but since it 's not hostile in any way , i wouldnt call it cat calling . 
  you have great punk , these are just the band i 've seen live in my city : [ anne m. christiansen ] ( https://annemchristiansen.bandcamp.com/releases ) - fantastic emotional hardcore punk , vocalist is a beast . 
  [ pacino ] ( https://pacino.bandcamp.com/track/ps-srdce ) - soothing post punk with some classic punk rock mixed in [ esazlesa ] ( https://esazlesa.bandcamp.com/ ) - romantic and long post-punky songs with screamo vocals put here and there . 
  if amazing czech bands such as these play in krak\u00f3w , they for sure play near where you live . 
  my flair is the answer . 
  all the norwegians i met were humble and `` poczciwy '' , so that 's the image in my head i have about you guys . 
  poczciwy is a word in polish , which does n't have a proper equivalent in english , but it 's an adjective which perfectly fits winnie the pooh , so maybe you get the idea . 
  the coolest one in the thread , for sure . 
  after osram nothing surprises me . 
  rich , democratic , smug . 
  [ vans basically ( http://scene7.zumiez.com/is/image/zumiez/pdp_hero/vans-old-skool-black-%26-white-skate-shoes-_204607-front.jpg ) , they 're not to large and not a lot of stuff fit in the , but few take a few trips and you 're settled . 
  i did n't say nothing about us economy , but rather about inequalities , which already are worse than 100 years ago : http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/pdf/f9.8.pdf and i seriously doubt that us government will implement any prosocial redistrubution policies in the next 10 or 20 years . 
  i believe the consensus shared by quite a lot of economists and sociologists is that us will remain a superpower , but income and wealth inequalities will keep raising to the point where you will end up as a really dystopian-lite country . 
  it fucking sucks , cause up until 1980s everything was going well in that department . 
  language . 
  of course i 'm biased since polish is my native language , but i 'd say it is sophisticated and poetic . 
  it has this grandiose spirit that i 'm very fond of , which i encounter whenever i read polish ( or translated to polish ) philosophy or poetry . 
  yes , it 's called like this biblical sea monster . 
   anything you 'd like to share about your culture i 'm open to hear . 
  polish person starter pack : - you 're blunt and direct with what you say - you 're an elitist when it comes to bread - on the evening of 24th of december you eat a traditional dinner with your closed one ( no need to be religious , it 's a pagan tradition in its roots anyway ) - statistically speaking , there 's a 60 % chance you 're a racist and / or a homophobe - you think your country 's utter shit , but still love to live in it - you put ketchup on pizza , you drown these slices in ketchup till italians explode - you 're religious - statistics about more than 90 % of poles being catholic are false , but it 's indeed true that lots of poles are religious , either they are christian and if not there 's a high chance they 're deists . 
  for many poles atheism is a ridiculous approach , and the approach i encounter the most while talking about this stuff with people is * i believe there is some sort of primordial power , i doubt it cares about me , but i 'd really want it to * . 
  of course it 's only my anegdotical experience , other poles here may disagree with me . 
  yeah , we are eastern european , nothing wrong with that in my opinion . 
  yep , that 's why you 're ee too , godless lil ' brother . 
  if russians would claim that russian dumplings are russian . 
  let me just say that after migration crisis i 've come to learn something about lots of people i know . 
  had there be a war or destabilization in my country i can see many poles eagerly participating in cleansing comparable with the one that happened in balkans in 90s . 
  but [ ice is located in poland ] ( http://www.icekrakow.com/ ) , not in k\u00f6ln ... 
  you cant drink alcohol in public and holding open bottle or can with any alcohol is good enough to get you a ticket . 
  open bottle of alcohol in public . 
  i will be morbidly excited once putin will die to follow the news and see how power will shift in russia . 
  as of now , it seems like the whole facade of russia is built around him and i wonder how the people who will run the system will introduce new lovely uncle for masses to admire . 
  euiii : holland into netherlands was my favourite playthrough . 
  other than that england , france or any small country by the sea . 
  * cebulactwo * - it 's a very finese term having its roots in underlying values in which majority of poles tend to believe . 
  we jokingly call people who put exceptional effort in realizing this philosophy * polaczek-cebulaczek * , but those are only jokes - in the end this set of values is shared by everyone in poland . 
  it 's hard to describe with words what values are those , since it 's more about mentality , not ** what ** you think , but ** how ** do you think . 
  anyway , i found a picture that maybe will shed a light onto * cebulactwo * for you : [ link ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_pwb2s3049ldgq6as4mf5dvkti6qh4v6l.jpg ) this intricate describtion on the image can be translated as * gra\u017cyna do n't clean yourself , we 're going to the pool * . 
  i found some data and in 2015 earning 1700 $ and more ( before taxes ) placed you in 2,55 % of richest poles . 
  something like 2200 $ probably makes you a one percenter here .
