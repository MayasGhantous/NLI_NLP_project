  krak\u00f3w too and i 've never heard your version surprisingly . 
  not a joke per se , but in poland if you do n't clean yourself and instead spray deodorant on your dirty sweaty body , it 's jokingly called a * romanian shower * . 
  obviously it 's a pick at romas , but people mix them with romanians . 
  they 're busy eating . 
  yeah , it must suck for macedonians that modern `` greeks '' try to claim ancient hellenic heritage for themselves . 
  if that surface on the right of the second picture is as smooth and flat as jt looks , this is some sick spot for skateboarding . 
   i ca n't stand tarkovsky that breaks my heart , next to jim jarmusch , he 's my favourite director and his films are the greatest cultural export your country has to offer in my opinion . 
  stalker and offret literally changed my way of thinking about my life and the world . 
  also , his shots are some of the greatest visual art i 've seen . 
  and , i fully agree on alexander nevsky . 
  it 's a shame that people in europe generally associate russian culture with babushka figures ( or dostoyevski if you 're lucky ) and do n't seem to be even aware of russian cinema . 
  all the exploitation that is happening in my country comes from looking up to american policies . 
  just pronounce `` three '' like `` free '' and it 'll be good enough . 
  i 've checked the pronunciation just now and it appears that i 've been saying this right and it was with polish phonetics . 
  yep . 
  recently there was like 8 eight people waiting in regular line , and kiosk was empty so i ordered my mccoffee like some sort of a priviliged person . 
  title would be ejfel on eiffel , and as hungarian films go , main protagonist would so depressed and distressed because of his life and love , that he would jump to his death from the tower . 
  i also had black vernacular / ebonics as the first one . 
   how do you pronounce been ? 
   with the vowel in sit  with the vowel in see there 's a fucking difference ? 
  holy shit , i 'm done with english . 
  we call your country * hiszpania * , i guess it 's pretty close : https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/hiszpania, 
  also seba and and\u017celika . 
  lw\u00f3w and warsaw . 
  both used to be besides cracow the polish citiew , that defined my country . 
  lw\u00f3w got handed over to ussr , and modern warsaw has almost nothing to do with pre-war one so i count it as lost basically . 
  i 'm defending you guys from a western european and you are still nitpicking / s, 
  when you 're the first generation in 200 years in your country that is not being fucked by russians and their government , when you see that their government which is backed by large part of the population still seems to look at your country as a lost asset , it 's quite understandable that you may be little hostile towards russians . 
  i 'm not one of those people , but i fully understand the sentiment . 
  i believe in [ instert noun here ] , but i refuse to personify it . 
  i 'm somewhere between being a deist and agnostic . 
  wilno and surrounding areas . 
  they speak with a weird accent there . 
  one time i was standing with a buddy outside a bar at around 2am , which was located next to us consulate . 
  whole time we were there , a policeman with a submachine gun was constantly looking at us . 
  it was pretty much the only time i saw a weapon larger than a pistol in a public place . 
  place 's intimidating , especially since they usually have these huge black suvs parked outside .

  do n't mind me , i 'm just sitting and waiting for frenchmen . 
  rom themselves can be simply put onto a memory stick , however in order for them to work you need to prepare something like this for each game : # castlevania : circle of the moon ( u ) game_name = dracula agb1 game_code = aame vender_code = a4 idle_loop_eliminate_target = 080003d2 and then copypaste it into the notepad file on the memory card . 
  gameboy advance emulator on psp i use requires finding information about each specific rom file and inputting it correctly via code in a notepad file . 
  recently it started popping out in bars and it instantly became my favourite . 
  it 's not available in retail i think , so when it comes to beers that you normally buy it 's either per\u0142a export or birra moretti . 
  i 'm a pleb , probably . 
  mem , `` e '' sounds like the one in `` ben '' . 
  our history class teacher told us that about jagiello and apparantly it is the most believed theory amongst polish historians . 
  when it comes to mickiewicz i mean of course whether he was polish or lithuanian . 
   freezing their asses off with friction comes warmth , so you must be wrong . 
  jagie\u0142\u0142o 's father and brother , jagie\u0142\u0142o ( and that he purposefully did n't crush teutonic knight to not make poland too powerful ) . 
  commonwealth . 
  we treated you badly throughout the centuries . 
  you have always thought of us ( almost ) like you think about russians . 
  you had some language revolution in xix century where you were backing out of polish language 's influence . 
  wilno dispute . 
  basically if it was n't related to poland in sone way , we didnt learn about it . 
   an armored attack on ruhnu island using the nation 's tank good one . 
  in my history classes finlandization was presented as a much much better alternative to what poland ended up with . 
  i 'd go with \u0141\u00f3d\u017a - it would be hilarious . 
  ( for non-poles : it would be like detroit was the capital of usa ), 
  also : * haha you have that app so you wont fuck your cousin , am i right ? 
  you must be an idiot to overexplain such a simple thing . 
  lithuania , it 's a lovely country , but i would feel like an intruder living there as a pole . 
  to be clear , i 've never experienced any hostility from lithuanians but i simply feel that i could never integrate there due to my nationality . 
  i may live in a racist , neoliberal , gay-hating , cathotaliban state , but at least i 've got slightly better weather . 
  in your face you homoswede ! ^ ^ :(, 
  is it the case for molly , alice , doris or charlie ? 
  it 's different culture i guess , but in poland it 's a white trash ( this term does n't work outside of usa , but you know what i mean ) stereotype to give your children anglicised names . 
  same , i live in cracow and it would n't be too bad to live in austria-hungary 2.0 i guess . 
  it may be offensive to have such an opinion , but i really do think that polish name for czech republic with its pronunciation sounds the best . 
  it 's '' czechy '' and it sounds like this : https://translate.google.pl/#pl/en/czechy, 
  how about the stereotype that most of you are depressed ? 
  when i think of the queen , i ca n't get away from this feeling that she 's a miserable toy of british nostalgia . 
  she appears to be like a canary held in a golden cage . 
  i fully agree with you , in previous comments i wanted to present a picture without stating any personal opinions . 
  technically there are clear distinctions , but some people think that po or pis ( former and current ruling parties ) are right wing and liberal , some call them leftists or even socialists . 
  i 'm not talking about any `` real '' labels that apply to these parties , the thread 's question is about things that people seem not to comprehend , and in poland it 's this . 
  which party is right-wing / centrist / left-wing . 
  it seems that in most european countries , no matter who votes for who , in general people agree which party is where on politcal spectrum . 
  in poland the same party can be seen far-right and far-left depending on who you ask . 
   it 's literally only around 3 words/phrases that are different only three ? 
  seriously though , there is this : https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/indeks:polski_-_regionalizmy_krakowskie , but most of these words are archaic or , i think , used not only in cracow / lesser poland . 
   it just takes up your entire day and there 's almost nothing to see [ while on the road ] besides tasteless adverts on roadsides . 
  i came here to say exactly that . 
  about the adverts . 
  it 's so fucking ugly driving throughout most of the country . 
  if it was up to me , i 'd choose [ this fella ] ( https://introduccionalahistoriajvg.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kolakowski.png ) the greatest pole people in poland do n't know about - leszek ko\u0142akowski . 
  yes , indid , it wud bi sow grayt . 
  dis sentens shur luks wird , bat imagen haw komfe it wud get after geting yusd to . 
  thanks for explanation . 
  no one criticized me for my accent or pronunciation during my short visit to england , only that my accent sounds very harsh , but that 's hardly a critique . 
  i got ta admit though , that it was really hard to communicate sometimes . 
  i talked with various people , and as you can imagine i had easier time understanding immigrants from whatever parts of the world , than with english-born people . 
  to be honest i was always curious if transpeople 's experiences during transision differ , whether they have genders in their native language or not . 
  like in english , you would say `` i drove a car '' not matter what , but in poland you would change how you express it from `` je\u017adzi\u0142am samochodem '' to `` je\u017adzi\u0142em samochodem '' and other way around . 
  i guess there are already several studies about it . 
  for fucks sake , there are other ways to pronounce `` third '' than with `` f '' ? 
  15 years of learning english down the drain . 
  i always been angry had , that you the verb at the end put have to . 
  it 's not so bad in writing or reading , but while talking with someone it 's always strange that you 've got ta wait for the end of a sentence to know what 's going on . 
  i recently sort of * upgraded * and now i think that 20 years ago was 1990 .
