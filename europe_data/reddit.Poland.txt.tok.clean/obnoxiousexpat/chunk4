  unfortunately the employment market , capital flow , credit cost , and others are set up in a way that the east is quite literally being fucked . 
  western ( german/dutch/american / swiss/etc ) porn industries and red light districts are not temples of liberalism and of social progress , but the exact place the this fucking over is being facilitated . 
   dubrovnik mayor was bragging about coca-cola making an exclusive dubrovnik-only bottle . 
  americans ... they 've ... noticed us ... * blushes *, 
  how otherwise would they know what to do and what to think ? 
  we can not allow * this * to happen again , right ? 
  germany could stop stealing as well , please . 
  it 's only to keep the swedish peasants in check , silly . 
  affluent swedes are above this `` transparency '' and `` inclusiveness '' bullshit . 
   how do you sink a polish battleship ? 
    put it in water . 
  you confused the jokes .

  the date of birth and family status you can take from linkedin/xing/cv / facebook/twitter/skype / ... 
  the previous address from old impressum ( web archive ) / whois/cv ... 
  it 's the same in germany, 
  how is it surprise ? 
  in `` privacy conscious '' germany the address of an individual and even more personal information are public as well by default . 
   ibm administrators in the czech republic were also given full access to all data and logs revenge for prague . 
  ond\u0159ej , post the url for the torrent !, 
  it will not be profitable to work on employment contract within couple of decades as the taxes and contributions will reach 50-60 % of the total cost of the salary . 
  barely anyone will be able maintain skills desirable enough on the market to have a net salary much above social benefits of those unemployable , many will fall out of the social security net . 
  citizens will be too old and tired to riot or even to protest . 
  we are awaiting eu-wide corporate oligopoly under the management of descendants of mostly german/french and some italian/spanish family fortunes , and some `` self-made '' cxo assholes from dach+l ux countries . 
  aaaah ... brutal suicides ( * wink wink * ) . 
  we have them in poland as well - no witnesses , short police investigation . 
  there is no cartel, 
  that 's exactly what the west is promising, 
  i do n't understand how position of countries who are cradles of terrorism is intact , but some polical fluctuations in poland can cause such a fierce response, 
  maybe people do n't care anymore ? 
  for years any vote not for po or pis was basically wasted, 
  just be careful because if you connect with the wrong department , your car will get torched, 
  this `` muppet '' and `` dwarf '' calling is one of the reasons why your sillly protests are doomed to fail, 
  how pis would be able to fuck it up for you ? 
  the polish membership in eu is strong and stable . 
  do n't bother poland , in 3 years the eu funds will dry up, 
  english countryside, 
  then good times ahead of the swedish steel industry !, 
  i 'm buying shares . 
  dutch would be my first guess, 
  * ossi * ... the unification was simply too brutal , too many traps set by the benevolent , tolerant , and inclusive west, 
  looks so boring . 
  i would cut myself with a slice of fried bacon if i had to live there . 
  you can still join eastern europe . 
  you have tomato , we have potato . 
   fumbling with stereotypes for lack of arguments , you 're being a credit to your nation . 
  you * really * hate poles - primitive drunkards and whores , do n't you ? 
  your daddy left with polish woman ? 
  a polish man perhaps ? 
  uuu you unmasked us !, 
  it 's below 4 % probably . 
  it 's impossible to drop to 0 export to a country one has a land border with . 
  ... and this topic of trading with russia - why is it so touchy for italians ? 
  [ someone tell where are they from ] ( https://video.repubblica.it/cronaca/venezia-turisti-si-tuffano-dal-ponte-di-calatrava/281525/282120 ) ... dutch ? 
  scandinavians ? 
  - someone clearly says `` they do n't speak english '', 
   but it does n't change the fact that you do way more business with russia than we do . 
   o the rest i say : it 's your largest export partner as well ( after the eu ) , no choice there either ? 
  or maybe it 's a choice when it costs other people and not a choice when it costs you ? 
  [ what on earth are you talking about , luigi ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ewshygb.png ) i know you would like to plow natasha , but do n't make up the things at least . 
  every company is incorporated in the netherlands nowadays . 
  * it 's not only beautiful but these hot-blooded southeners are even brawling for our entertainment ... quick , make photos !, 
   difficulties around deposits oh tell me about it !, 
  it 's a fucking nightmare in germany, 
  right in the crotch !, 
  so germans are indeed starting to spend the money ... domestically . 
  there will be so much sex happening on * ponte di rialto * this season . 
  one simply should be careful with reddit . 
  arrogant . 
  they hired marketing and communication teams from mercedes ? 
  what about backpacker with credit card and big credit limit ? 
  gas , it 's not like we have a choice, 
  i have a `` city card '' for the visitors , maybe with the discount ? 
   1 billion dollars would go a lot further in the hands of 1000 people than in the hands of just one person , because the 1000 people would probably spend more of it that was very vocal argument in germany when they accepted over 1 million people in the last two years - to stimulate the basic consumption and increase demand for unsophisticated services . 
  pity that it 's mostly people on employment contracts who sponsor this redistribution experiment . 
  but ... cash ... this sweet easy cash ... and the property bubble ... why not just to jump in ? 
  there are no interesting and visit-worthy places in filthy eastern europe , right ? 
  italy is very fond of doing business with russia , yes we know about it . 
  at least they do n't seem to blame eastern europeans anymore for everything , so there * is * a progress, 
   normaly paid full time working people those are paying off the mortgages ... and property in germany is not cheap at all . 
  i 'm paying with eur 50 note , keep the change . 
  i will take spritz aperol with it , thanks . 
  seriously ? 
  this was in the news ? 
   italy gets worse every time you look at it and offers less and less to young people , the leftovers of the last italian demographic boom is reaching mid 30s now , so not so young anymore at all . 
   it was the richest place in portugal before , i am not making any money and the city is losing a lot . 
   for places like barcelona or lisbon tourism then change it ? 
  as for now it 's impossible to walk along the main boulevards of lisbon without being sucked into some tourist trap restaurant . 
  i 've been boycotting bmw , audi , mercedes , amg , bugatti since like ... always . 
  you would like to have a livable city but then realize that you can charge the tourists eur 100 per night for a tiny dark room ( even eur 150 during the season ! ), 
  and eur 10 for a slice of pizza ( is pizza even a dish from veneto ?! ) . 
  who would resist ? 
  you do n't ... and this is what you get . 
  now go back and be nice to german , american , and chinese tourists .
