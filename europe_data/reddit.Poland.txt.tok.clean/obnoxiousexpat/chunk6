  [ they are more german than many german citizens . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_saxe-coburg_and_gotha#united_kingdom ), 
  age structure of the people migrating ? 
  birth/fertility rates in italy are among the worst in the world . 
  nothing is tastier for germany than a young , educated , taxpaying eu citizen . 
  `` occupy '' as in `` to take or use space '' , `` to live or reside in '' . 
  is my claim incorrect ? 
  the tat and accessories can be imported and distributed with the help of chinese . 
  how convenient . 
  i 'm not trying to blame the immigration for anything . 
  improvised stands where africans/sri lankans/bangledeshis are selling counterfeited accessories and tat have become the part of italian cities ' landscape . 
  no , poland has to stay poor . 
  it makes you stronger . 
  nothing bolsters the economy better than stimulation of trade of lighters , paper tissues , bracelets , and sunglasses . 
  utrecht is expensive and boring , their red light district is packed with eastern european ladies doing stunning careers . 
  at least nobody installs window curtains so one can see how people there live . 
  many of these poor families are stuck with unsellable property . 
  africans/sri lankans/bangladeshis are literally occupying the streets . 
  there is exodus of italians younger than 35 to germany and uk . 
  italy is fucked . 
  it thought it might be a protocol/dress code thing . 
  why the boy is wearing silly short trousers ? 
  edit [ polish ( ... ehem ... german ) media keep an eye on / r/europe . 
  who living in poland has so much time and spare money to attend all these protests ? 
   outsourced workers gain skill and experience which should , over time , increase innovation . 
  not at all . 
  their initiative , autonomy , creativeness ( the constructive one ) are efficiently tempered and numbed in such places . 
   but ... finland is smart , it 's not a fair comparison . 
  do n't idolize them so much , finland is a drunk wooden clog floating in the lake . 
  i do n't know which poland/czechia/romania / etc you are talking about but it 's not the one i 've seen or experienced . 
  it 's not enough - the intercom at the destination address has to be labeled correctly as well . 
   those numbers are close to `` whoever wants to work can . '', 
  the bureaucracy in unemployment offices is atrocious , the social care ( almost ) nonexistent , rental security ( almost ) nonexistent . 
  it 's more `` whoever does n't work , ends up on the street '' . 
  china is buying off the eu 's industry , innovation , and property . 
  people moan `` muh , human rights , authoritarian regime , internet censorship '' and then cash out the sweet american dollars . 
   food , housing and basic services account for most of the average persons budget . 
  and these are highly influenced by local wages . 
  they are not , as the property bubble attracts investors from richer countries . 
  so we end up with city districts where population with local salaries can not afford to live in , oftentimes empty . 
  the most obnoxious example is prague , in poland there is country-wide suburbanization . 
  show me a studio flat in warsaw/krakow/prague / bratislava/wroclaw/budapest for 100/200 $ per month . 
   elon musk started a car company . 
  so yes , you can just start a car company . 
  sure , i 'm doing hair transplantation tomorrow , registering `` pierogi ltd '' in uk , and waiting for millions to flow into my bank account so i can start investing . 
  not . 
   100/200 $ rents do n't really exist in western europe neither they exist in any major city in a country colored bright pink on the map . 
  what kind of car ? 
  tesla would probably be cheaper in norway than in poland . 
   what has the inability of the polish to run a car company to do with labour markets and wages ? 
  you are free to start a car company and sell the cars for a profit arent you ? 
  patents , supply chains , regulation lobbying ... you do n't think you can just start producing cars do you ? 
  then watch out not to choke on it . 
  you can stick your welfare into your herring salad . 
  i fucking swear one day i will open an outsourcing center in germany or sweden and through some sophisticated accounting , perfectly legal , i will pay you all 1 euro/hour . 
  british loan sharks active on this market are not helping . 
   you can not raise wages higher than productivity . 
  a person with the same degree , experience , knowledge , expertise , working on the same project will earn in poland half of what one would earn in germany . 
  you are not going out of the poor so easily , poland . 
  now do as your french/german/swedish / norwegian manager tells you to and always unconditionally be nice to them . 
  remember to choke and undermine your fellow poles in workplace to get a raise and earn 0.3 instead of 0.25 of salary you would be getting in a more developed country . 
  as a pole with professional experience in developed eu countries i can say that one of the strongest feelings i experienced while being there was not being impressed . 
  you might get very disappointed later this century . 
  young people in poland : are working , paying off the mortgages , providing for their families , emigrated long time ago . 
  start protesting over essential issues , nobody cares about your courts and judges . 
  eastern europe does n't need enemies or invaders , they will finish themselves ... 
  the whole deportation scheme relies on assumption that the home/destination countries will cooperate . 
  the one event in december in berlin verified this assumption . 
  iceland will soon offer saving accounts on mars with 10 % interest rate and will be opening a pub on venus selling beer 20 euro/pint . 
   open a shop on moon german businesses will get very confused trying to send a letter over there , but nothing is impossible - just fine and sue the moon into oblivion . 
  this will take tax evasion to a whole new level . 
   redirect gas away from eastern and central europe , and eventually eliminate gas deliveries through ukraine germany accepted over one million of migrants because it * trusts * countries like tunisia , somalia , eritrea , morocco , afganistan that they will cooperate with deportations , but it * does n't trust * pretty legitimate country like ukraine regarding the gas transit . 
  they relocated their headquarters to berlin because it was n't possible to rent anything in stockholm , lol . 
  researchers - come to france !, 
  ( please disregard the army on the streets ), 
  exactly that 's the point - it 's perfectly legal . 
  yet people get fucked . 
  two words : notice period , also it takes some time until the visa is sorted out and until then the employee is on time-limited contract . 
  so how does it ? 
  i 'm all ears . 
  gypsy expats from czechia . 
  typical corporate structure of an outsourcing center in eastern europe ( yes , including czechia ) is : american management and ukrainian/russian engineers/specialists/workforce , all employed ( visas ) by the subsidiary based in this country and based there . 
  something does n't work out or things are getting too expensive ? 
  * pufff ... 
  i fixed it , boss * - all of them firable by one click of a mouse . 
  germany brain drains half of the eu only to fart out in return it/internet `` innovators '' like soulless sap , copycat zalando , or deceasing soundcloud . 
   sweeden could have cut their iron supply nothing soothes any ethical and moral doubts better than a good deal with german industry . 
  europe wants to pay the specialists stagnant salaries , hire new people only through subcontracting/outsourcing , and it 's completely surprised that the stream of new migrants having arrived in the last two years are not exactly specialists or even talent . 
  lol scandinavians with wallets full of oil money , visiting miserable regions , think that smiling locals who provide them services is an indication that the region is doing fine . 
  the new [ * bohemians * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemianism ), 
  during communism it was known that people 's lives can be destroyed for disobedience or for being in the wrong place , so people were very careful with this kind of judgements . 
  [ your local bartender could be a commander during the liberation of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis\u0142aw_maczek#exile ) , [ and the stewardess could be a former soe secret agent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krystyna_skarbek#postwar ) . 
  hell , even nowadays one can be fired from a cozy corporate job for saying the wrong thing . 
  the notion during my stay in the united kingdom that the area where one lives and the job one holds is one 's destiny and there is no way up was very sobering and shocking . 
  welcome to the british precariat . 
  you say as if having some natural wonders in administration excuses them to facilitate a rip-off . 
  yes , send them chinese tourists . 
  as tourists , europeans are too timid and too generous . 
   as a high-cost country , why everyone so easily accepts that nordics must be high-cost and agree to pay ridiculous money even for very basic food , tat , or some miserable accommodation ? 
  can the urge to smell a fermented herring be really so strong ?
