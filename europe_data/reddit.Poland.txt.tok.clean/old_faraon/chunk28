  comparing exploiting workers in a 3 companies in poland to death camps is not appropriate ( poland has no influence to change anything that happens in north korea , see my last paragraph ) . 
  the ship builders from poland already do a lot of their work for scandinavian shipyards by going there and doing contract work so there a significant pull for workers which is filled with belorusians and ukrainians mostly . 
  the problem is not large ( about 500 people in all of poland ) and everybody has their own problems . 
  it 's also very hard to prosecute anybody since all of the workers lie when they are checked ( because their family is held hostage at home ) . 
  i 'd be happy if those pieces of shit employers got what they deserve but i do n't see it happening . 
  stopping this practice would need sanctions from the poland against nk , an the question is would they help anybody really since the koreans would also stop sending their student to poland who thus see the real world and may be the leaders of the future less totalitarian nk . 
  it 's the extension of the whole nk question . 
  war now and freedom in 5 years or waiting for the regime to fall in 30 . 
  which one will bring less people suffering . 
  i do n't know which is the correct choice . 
  the winning countries all use l2 ( poland could technically send something like the pt90 or some older t72s but that would be stupid ) so there might be something in this . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7192292/1-26022016-ap-en.pdf/602b34e8-abba-439e-b555-4c3cb1dbbe6e this says that cornwall is ( in 2014 ) about twice as rich as eastern poland nominal and 1.5 as rich parity adjusted ( so about equal to the polish average ) . 
  the fact that the other maps show that eastern poland is getting richer ( well less poor ) and cornawall is getting poorer i can see why people are angry . 
  they are called tur, 
  well i wont defending this shit but op was talking about large advertisements that cover the whole front of the building like the ones on and next to the rotunda on the photo or on the buildings in front overlooking aleje jerozolimskie not the shitty small banners that infest every facade like a fungus . 
  lets concentrate on one type of shit at a time . 
  well we might have varying definitions of wildfire with mine the development from crazy through illegal to dominant religion in the roman empire in 350 years being lightning fast . 
   proto-christians were ridiculled and mocked by philosophers and politicians . 
  also were illegal and yet still managed to spread . 
  that speaks of the fertility of the ground the idea fell on . 
  blade runner presented a world that was very much shit , so that substitution is not needed . 
  it 's from vlahs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallach, 
  waterloo is great ok but the only thing good about 87 was terry wogan judging from that clip, 
  great to see that you liked it, 
  fuck too much domestic news, 
  this photo looks like it tries to hide that there are nicer parts of warsaw https://www.coleurope.eu/sites/default/files/styles/large_image/public/uploads/page/panoramic-view-from-30th-floor-warsaw-towers.jpg?itok=gful1yqh same location just look ~ ~ left ~ ~ right ( you can see the train station in both ) edit : the directions, 
  they want too look like true capitalists so they chose the dystopic visions of the 80s as their style guide ( vide blade runner ), 
   the franks took over the roman empire after all , and created a huge empire . 
  i do n't think their weaponry would be really inferior . 
  they weapons were not inferior they were almost the same since they mostly used the same sword , spear and shield as the romans .

   great khan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khaqan khan of khans should be translated as emperor the same way https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_of_kings is used  british empire was ruled by a king/queen king queen of england/scotland etc. 
  but emperor/ress of india but there are more empires not ruled by an emperor literally ( swedish , frankish like you said ) . 
  but there is one characteristic of an empire and emperor that is most important . 
  they do n't have to take shit from anybody foreign , and the only way belgium stayed independent was a guarantee from the british empire . 
  a pilum is a much better weapon :d these are some interesting points about this axe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cccbl_y3ztm, 
   second ^ belgian ^ empire ^ ftw second ? 
  no emperor no empire . 
  also congo is big for belgium but come on . 
  alexanders death ? 
  the process continued in the lands ruled by the successor kingdoms but no new ones were added as far as i remember . 
  i do n't think romans where hellenized but they imported so much of the good stuff that they might have been , then they re-exported it to much of the known world . 
  then christianity spread like wild fire over hellenized lands and then the successive spread in eastern and central europe was just christianization . 
   then after that nation states united most of them etc etc you skipped centralized monarchy , absolutism , enlightened absolutism and about 400 years . 
  the nation state almost completely dominant around the world right now is fairly recent . 
  and with physical barriers related to ease of communication and travel dropping is starting to look like a artificial barrier for business and generally individuals ( whether for good or for bad is a different discussion ) and artificial barriers are an imbalance . 
  you mean this weapon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisca or something earlier ? 
  in poland the factor is money . 
  children are expensive . 
  this makes them a very hard decision for people in the middle class as they are very much at risk of feeling a significant drop of quality of life across the board . 
  this is less of a problem for poor families since the added costs are absorbed partly by welfare which constitutes a big part of their budget anyway and they do n't have disposable income to begin with so no quality of life change . 
  when the money problem is lessened such as with families that moved to the uk , ireland , germany or norway they have a much higher replacement rate ( about 2.1 abroad instead of the 1.4 ) . 
  there are some voices ( one article ) i 've seen that say it 's a unfair comparison since the emigrants a usually younger then the general population and the difference is 2.1 vs 2 if you account for that but i would n't trust our journalists to add 2 and 2 together and not make an error and i 'm too lazy to check it on my own . 
  there are also some attitude problem , some of the 30-40 year old 's now are very much formed by the transformation of the 90 's . 
  they are yuppies ( or at least they 'd like to be , the pay does not come with the attitude ) and not really interested in children , they so their parents stop asking them at christmas and are done with it . 
  maybe if you won the second balkan war, 
   ego-centrism this has been with us forever, 
  we 'd be called grudge lords . 
  and have a great addition to his portfolio, 
  great now i just need to visit :d, 
  look like credits from some sf setting, 
  i have to second that . 
  wanted some lits to have a plc coat of arms in my wallet and was bummed that you got the euro , but fortunately the back still has some nice vytis/pogon . 
  are the lithuanian coins common in lithuania or are they mixed with mostly other european coins . 
  but the sun has not moved and still is considerably lower ( on the horizon ) then in the south . 
  i 'd be surprised too i thought they all went to cracow, 
  it 's only been a fortnight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing#deployments, 
  average iq by definition is 100 ( for a given population ) because that is the way the scale is calibrated, 
  i do n't think anybody in the east has any doubts except for useful idiots , it 's the west that needs to realize this . 
  great set up for a joke  why did i go that far . 
  because of : * nosy people * bastards like you * - everybody asking | - asking what | - see what i meant, 
   a bit like poland citation needed eurobarometer says that poles are generally happy with eu , want more integration ( except the euro ) , are above eu28 average in identifying with europe and the eu and feel that eu countries share values . 
  and here i thought albertans are like texans just loudly shouting `` i 'm sorry '' instead of yeeeehaaawwww, 
   well , that 's the right attire - if the spiders would be nice enough to bring the zone with them . 
  what are you saying that this is not proper everyday attire east of the oder . 
   hen it 's time for superpowers and colourful un-catholic tights . 
  i do n't know about un-catholic but they are very much un-polish . 
  our superheroes wear long dresses [ like here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/anonymous_-_portrait_of_john_iii_sobieski_%284th_quarter_of_xvii_century%29_-_google_art_project.jpg ),

  think how they 'll look after they pass the alienation zone . 
  https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm this site claims the terrain is between 28-31 m where the tallest building stands so it might well already be the tallest point at 148 ( 120 + 28 ) meters . 
  you know that song was about fighting germans ( mostly ) , polish , czech and russians because of disagreements in the christianity . 
  but maybe something like it-magician , technomancer , techno-sorcerer ( this word is in the firefox dictionary ) , secret monger ( for those in security ) , process wizard would sond good in swedish . 
  neither am i , my only reactions to the / pol / signal is to see who reacts and do n't invite them to my next party, 
  was resting but i saw the pol-signal ( somebody is talking about poland on the internet not to be confused with the / pol / - signal ) :d, 
  cze\u015b\u0107 what 's going on here . 
  the eu put mostly an existing food industry standard on the quality of bananas into a directive to make it the same across the whole market . 
  it included definitions of the curvature of the banana to be classified class 1 . 
  since supermarkets are only interested in the best bananas ( because they sell better to customers ) so they buy only class 1 this means you cannon really buy a straight one retail . 
  this spawned an euro myth that brussels has forbidden the sale of bananas not curvy enough . 
  of course eu programs are some magic bullet that allow a country to become rich , but they open opportunities and incentives which were not there . 
  you of course have to take advantage of them . 
  poland did n't start eu integration in 2003 , first talks were held in 89 and then had a trade agreement with poland since 94 that allowed access to eu market . 
  this is why it was growing in the late 90s . 
  constant pressure from eu is also responsible for the dramatic fall of corruption in poland through changes to laws and institutions . 
  it took almost 25 years to join the eu from starting the phare program till the end of the transition periods in 2011 . 
  concentrating on 2004 is not really helpful . 
  rightful bulgarian clay . 
   i was thinking of using the same system for the parliament and the senate , so that both are proportional .
