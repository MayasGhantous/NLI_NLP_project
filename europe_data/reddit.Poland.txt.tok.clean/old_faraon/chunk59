  white croats on the other hand are only know in early medieval texts and their location ( especially since they were migrating at the time ) is not as precisely known . 
  alba iulia is a very nice place but i would remove everything outside the walls of the citadel . 
   perhaps they have a different definition of `` bad '' and `` good '' then ... 
  i try to shy away from such strong statements as it would mean that russia versus europe narrative that putin is promoting is true and we are destined to fight . 
  i choose rather to think that the `` we occupants '' people are just a vocal nationalistic minority and most of just do n't care .

  that table is gold, 
   the problem is that the russians have never been able or willing to separate themselves form the actions of the ussr they kind of did . 
  they say russia gained independence from the ussr . 
  everything bad before the 90 's was the caused by communist ussr and everything good was proud russian people . 
  i though he was building infrastructure in europe or a bridge to the uk,

  british war machines have kettles built in . 
  the chunnel, 
  hoch energie , mega i expected some english language content for other europeans but it seems it mostly died down . 
  i like how integrated europe is warsaw :d keep having no breaks on the europe train and my gotterfunken will intensify . 
  i 'll probably keep the mega slogan . 
  damn that place looks american as fuck , the buildings and especially the clothes drier . 
  i never heard of this movie fortunately :d . the new x-men : apocalypse movie almost got stuff right ( except motivations of anyone involved and shitty actors ) , even fasbender was talking polish . 
  a blacklist episode taking place in warsaw had air photos of ankara ( or istanbul it was some time ago ) with a giant mosque in some scenes . 
  though the rest was okayish . 
   innovative jams . 
  like tangerine jams , or celery jams, 
  since everybody is pilling on . 
  2 . in supermarkets baggers are just a waste of time and money and i assume they do a shit job at it ( soft on the bottom , uneven bags ) 3 . 
  we 'll see during the next year after article 50 in spring and french ( and german ) elections . 
  i think it 's possible this will make the eu stronger . 
  4 . do n't really care unless it 's some real butchering without reason 5 . negative , it 's easy since there 's no polish involvement , especially how it ended for countries other then in the british empire with bloody wars of independence . 
  6 . there is so much do choose from ( some seasonal or even one time ) i rarely drink two of the same beer . 
  i started english at 5 years old but it 's mandatory from about 8 years old and from about 13 years old you start your second foreign language 8 . yeah mostly short comedy forms , though some of the jokes are probably hard to translate and i do n't know if anyone even tried .

  the devil lives at the crossroads so you have to put a shrine to fight him . 
  the are crossed or jesus or virgin mary statues on almost every crossroad in poland where the original road is older then 100 years . 
  just because nobody came from belarus i would like to nominate world of tanks for them . 
  romania has blessed ciolos and saint kovesi bulgaria has a mig 29 pilot for president . 
  croatia has a president that looks ( looked ) great in bikini . 
  portugal has a president that reacts like nice professor to french journalists not knowing who he is . 
  czechia has a crazy president but the rest seems sensible like always . 
  all ( most ) of that i learned from / r/europe, 
  shot an ak and a 9mm on a shooting range . 
  few of my friends went to the shooting range as a stag party activity . 
  you do n't survive the winter by being friendly and easy to talk , you do it by preparing wood and food for the winter .

  chile was capitalist not liberal . 
  or the actual shouting, 
   i supposed to tell apart a white dude that goes to church and speaks a european language from an actual european , right ? 
  this sub is the very definition of `` yanks asking about europe like it 's all the same '' so if they ca n't do it being part of the west i do n't really suppose the rest of the world is much better . 
  the rest of the world generalizes europe and the west just as much so i do n't think the whole thing is eurocentric , just local centric . 
  some strong culturally ( or generally strong ) countries can get out of it ( japan , germany , france ) a bit but most people will generalize to regions about the size of europe . 
  http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark/illogical-numbers-hurt-students.html on further checking this might be only source . 
   our language is more practical . 
  did n't you need to start teaching counting to children in swedish because the danish number system made it hard for the to learn math ? 
  yeah but us climate regulations only work in the us so the only thing that matters is the place of production . 
  most of the `` designed in the usa '' stuff is produced in in china so the only thing that matters is whether they will stick with the paris plan . 
  which is stupid because the people that care really have no qualms about speaking shit about america to their face , some even switch to broken english just so the americans can understand . 
  hah low ambition we where supposed to be the second japan . 
  not yet . 
  we 'll see what the future holds . 
  but it did turn into a much a more shitty , hateful and worse governed state . 
   alexis tsipras i wanted to say it 's been more that a year since he left :d but he is apparently back . 
  only hollande and putin matter since all other countries are ruled by the pm . 
  though i do n't really know that much more about them unless they are the center of some international affair , so only may , merkel , renzi , orban , gebauskaite ( not really the center just our neighborly iron lady ) ,, 
  i would say this is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldq7hxmlxgc the pinnacle but the soviet one is ok if you confine yourself to real ones . 
  5-15 $ , usually take 10 $ out unless i plan to pay for something more than a beer with cash . 
  there like one pub i go to that 's to cheep to have a terminal so that 's the only place i use my cash , outside buying a ticket here and there . 
  in polish it 's funny since originally it was w\u0105pierz but now we use wampir , but we still use upi\u00f3r sometimes for a ghost/revenant,

  i have a magnet on my fridge of a cuckoo clock that says switzerland ( brought by my brother from there ) so you are not really helping yourselves get rid of it . 
  high school is much more concentrated on the rest of the world . 
   celsius is based on water temperature , so is fahrenheit ( water ice mixture - human body temp )  is incomparable to the temperature the human body feels . 
  but it 's much better on all other fronts . 
  also phase transition of water makes much a bigger difference on how the conditions are outside , especially with wind chill changing it by 10c . 
  on the other end boiling water is the most common thermal i process i do . 
   we 're a republic . 
  so are most of the countries in europe and most do have proportional representation . 
  one has almost nothing to do with the other .

  with a release ' 18 - ' 19 . 
  it 's ireland 's pm, 
  reenactment is quite popular but is more focused then the renfair ` generic old timey europe ' . 
  try this ( in poland , i know there are similar ones in other countries but do n't really know of the top of my head what to search for ) high middle ages battle reenactments ( they also have some fair type side attractions ) battle of grunwald http://www.grunwald1410.pl/ siege of malbork http://oblezenie.zamek.malbork.pl/ early middle ages http://www.jomsborg-vineta.com/festiwal.php medieval fighting tournament : http://botn.info/en/ there are more in other nations and in other time periods like this xvii c. http://www.gruppostoricocittadipalmanova.com/en/the-reenactment,
