   the polish minister of justice and public prosecutor , general zbigniew ziobro , he fortunately is just a `` persecutor general '' as in head persecutor and not a literal general, 
  depending on metric chosen poland was slightly better or slightly worse gdp wise in 1990 https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:rom:bgr:hun&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rom:bgr:hun:pol&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=638319600000&amp;tend=1395702000000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false most of the difference comes in 1990-2000 your transformation to capitalism was handled badly while ours had a lot of luck . 
  also you have some structural poor problem ( read gypsies ) that probably wo n't allow you to reach higher stats per capita even if bucharest gets rich as fuck . 
  where is fika and more fika in sweden, 
  nothing is happening in crimea ( well russians are oppressing tatars but what else is new ) , it 's happening in eastern ukraine . 
  the conflict ended , the occupation did n't, 
  what makes you think he would tell anything about the plot that was in progress if they asked ? 
  though the lack of sources is a disgrace . 
  i 'd like to see what giodo has to say about it , every kiosk would have to be equipped to handle sensitive private data :d . 
  what were those military contractors doing in canada that made them so suspicious of tracking ? 
  konstantynopolita\u0144czykowianeczka would be a proper diminutive about the unmarried daughter of a man called konstantynopolita\u0144czyk so a diminutive of konstantynopolita\u0144czyk\u00f3wna, 
  i would tell you about our glorious standardized electric plugs but it 's a shit show here . 
  the sockets are all over the place with the french , schuko , british danish and italian ones not counting some legacy ones in old places that do n't work with anything modern . 
  fortunately you can use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europlug everywhere with a bit of force and a toothpick in the case of british sockets . 
  has all to do with how usa does standardization . 
  you get one or two most popular existing ways of doing stuff decide if they have huge errors call them a standard and are done with it . 
  while europe since the 19th century got a comity decided the `` best '' way to do something and then forced it on everybody . 
  that 's how you ended up with legal and letter while we use the glorious a system . 
  or how when fiberoptic standards were decided us ended with 24 timeslot system as that was the one that was used on regular lines and they just had to slap it on and europe used a 32 slot system as it was easier to implement in a pure system . 
  problem is that experts make mistakes or can be malicious people , the system usually is considered good if it can easily survive one malicious actor ( it this case a bad/corrupt expert ) and still do its job . 
  this system ( and many like it in other places in europe ) seams not have these safeguards . 
  what it needs is a process to second guess those decisions . 
  probably ( almost ) none because they did n't apply . 
  they have a legal way to come and they use it . 
  personally i consider taking of zaolzie a fucking disgrace . 
  both the polish one during munich and the czech one during the polish-bolshevik war . 
  i should have been taken care by a league of nations referendum brigaded by people from both sides traveling from around the country to vote and only accepted by the wining side like contemporary tradition dictated . 
  romania was also a cool bro in sep ' 39 . 
  we were neighbors with hungary just before ww2 all was needed was the partitioning of czechoslovakia with hungary taking the east . 
  is the italian subredit heavily automoderated or are you just part of the ai agenda because you posted the same thing an hour before here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bj3rl/your_national_sub_gets_hold_of_the_government/d19m3o9, 
  the problem is there were elections in other places and the islamists won , while in tunisia they lost ( to their surprise ) because the people there did n't want them there . 
  tak kommonwealth stronk kause uses hard k , ka n't invade . 
   cayenne no way , too close to precious esa rockets .

  i always seen it as arrogant asshole hosts . 
  one might see that as an argument for throwing greeks out instead of inviting turks in :d on a more serious note urbanized west turkey is ok but the rural east has some way to go still . 
  well once they reach most of the standards they can enter eea and even be able to use pre-access funds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrument_for_pre-accession_assistance, 
  the odysseus stratagem achaean horse ( lets give credit where credit is due it 's not the trojans who built it ) hippotrojan iliumite equine there apparently is a need for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koalang, 
  the original titles in polish were 2x `` three dutch arabs '' and `` three arabs '', 
  like i said i know , but it was relegated to being a joke the beginning of 00 ' . 
  i know but that was 20 years ago and the joke is still going strong :d, 
  every body was joking for years that you can buy a ak and a bucket of ammo on a bazaar for 5 $ and bottle of vodka . 
  apparently someone believed . 
   the belgian police is as trustworthy as a mellon . 
  is that a french saying ? 
  * russia is already mordor * hungary would be rohan * baltics would would dale , erebor and lake-town and kaliningrad dol guldur * poland would have to be mirkwood * ukraine would have to be gondor ( with crimea as belfalas and donbas as ithilien ),

  do you have another army hidden somewhere ? 
  with navy helicopters that can fly over the see , recon jets that can manage the cold dark night and guns that that you do n't feel the need to throw away when they get hot after shooting too many bullets . 
  hmm i now saw it when i zoom the fuck out of it that some very light grey, 
  greenland is also not there, 
  well 15 years ago a few of my friends had their computer fried when lightning struck part of it jumped to the ethernet cables run on the side of buildings . 
  you need to put a holy icon in the window so the lightning strikes your godless neighbor . 
  they livestream it for about the first 30-45 min so untill payload separation if it 's a leo mission . 
  i 've watched some of the footage live as it was happening and everything was there . 
  they seem to be the only ones doing livestreaming from the rocket . 
  also they have a very nice overlay during the launch with flight stages and flight parameters . 
  they invested some time and money to make enjoyable to watch . 
  probably because they use the public to pressure the us government while ula have the dominant position . 
   other cultures i do n't know about other cultures but here we have przeci\u0105g ( draft ) which is propust from my understanding . 
  also we have the wet hair stuff . 
  also you can `` get the wolf '' - `` dosta\u0107 wilka '' when you sit on cold stones or concrete . 
  it 's seams it 's better for small companies . 
  also we are not talking about incorporating . 
  red rose ones, 
  while far from crappy proton-m has had a lot of problems lately with most of the failures happening in the last 6 years . 
  there are some organizational problems in russia that worsened in that time , it lead to reorganization of the russian space industry to alleviate it . 
   westlife nothing to be proud about :d better put the cranberries there . 
   sorry for the bombardment . 
  nah it 's good thanks i 'll check the movies . 
  i 'm already watching vikings . 
  heh when i 've read it the first thing i thought about was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkwzm8tdea0, 
  it 's really strange that i do n't think i 've seen any cultural product from ireland except comedians on qi . 
  it seams like an exception from english speaking countries i 've seen tv series from australia , movies from new zealand and south africa , of course stuff from the us and the uk but the only thing from ireland i can remember is that church sexual abuse movie from the 00 's and i did n't watch that ( it 's obvious catholic priests are a bunch of pedophiles i do n't need a movie to tell me that ) . 
  anything you would recommend to change that ? . 
   or they 'll go after your business with constant lawsuits and protectionism , france does do some stupid shit forcing protectionist policies i 'll give you that , but the other lawsuits are fair at least half the time . 
  the companies refuse to do acknowledge local laws that are in effect for local companies yet still want to do business . 
  how long do you think it takes for the us to sue you if you do business there and do n't follow local laws . 
  btw when those companies pay most of their taxes in bermuda , some other tax heaven or even better claim no tax jurisdiction like apple does you need to ask yourself how much `` your business '' they are . 
   demand help with their military adventures adventure , singular , and most of eu was against libya and the us should have been too . 
   while sending token support for ours that token support for all those adventures is already taxing for the comparatively underfunded european armies . 
  yet not only having nothing to gain but a lot of times a lot to loose ( england and spain were attacked by terrorists literally for helping the us in iraq ) time and time again european nations helped the us . 
  larger european capabilities to help the us militarily would come at the cost of europe having the capability to force it 's own foreign policy on other parts of the world ( the poor ones of course ) sometimes against the will of the us . 
  that is the bargain both sides of the atlantic took . 
  who ? 
  snowden got asylum in russia ( technically europe but we are discussing eu here ) and assange in ecuador . 
  i do n't remember any other cases of `` traitors '' on the run in europe . 
  france is the only one that seems to want to step up in the foreign policy but mostly in their backyard ( former french colonies ) so the rest of eu is not really into it . 
   you guys could be the most powerful super power but you 're all `` muh history '' there is still too much dividing us , economically and identity wise . 
  mentally and culturally we 're closer then people think , we just concentrate on the differences too much . 
  we need probably another 20-30 years of good economy or a war with some `` other '' to make us stick together and understand that we might be much closer to each other then to other parts of the world . 
  either scenario is not likely right now . 
   conspire to fight the us tooth and nail they 're doing a pretty shit job at it considering the worst case scenario is `` we do n't like what you are doing so we wo n't help you '' . 
  nato is as much a tool of american dominance as it is a shield for europe . 
  the client relation of european states is beneficial to the us . 
  i agree that ukraine is mostly a eu problem , unfortunately the solidarity is lacking . 
  too much red . 
  remove soviets etc. 
  but you probably could do something nice with perspective :d . or maybe a planet in the middle illuminated form both sides ( improbable and not stable but possible ) . 
  it 's not just germany and france , everybody in the world makes the main thing about their space agencies logos to be space and humanity 's place it the universe not because they they are afraid of the nationalistic connotation but because it is not their main focus .
