  i dont even go to srs but whatevs . 
  srs stealing passwords etc ? 
  those are pretty serious claims . 
  got any proof of that ? 
   they are powerful enough to make people shut up are you referring to creepshots and jailbait ? 
  oh please . 
  do explain how srs is oppressing your freezed peach and how they are literally destroying reddit . 
  that makes it even weirder . 
  why would you go through all that trouble to tag all these people . 
  you tag people that post in srs and then reply to them with ` go back to the fempire ! ', 
  even though it has nothing to do with what they said ? 
  what does this have to do with fempire ? 
   once through the wash it shrinks so much it does n't shrink , it just * fits * . 
  american apparel . 
  do n't think so . 
  we can try blaming merkel though . 
  that 's still capitalism though . 
  there are many varieties of capitalism , i remember the rampart one that immanently followed communism , and it was almost as bad . 
  the state does n't run half of economy in social democracy . 
  it owns key industries that currently are being privatized all over the europe , such as post service , health care , railways etc. 
  but that 's still way different than planned economy . 
  cause communism worked so well , right ? 
  i sure miss waiting 30 years for a tiny flat and 10 years for something that vaguely resembles a car . 
  funny games , run lola run , goodbye lenin , head-on , die fetten jahre sind vorbei , the white ribbon , and all those savannajeff named . 
   i know that german productions usually are not that great . 
  german cinema is quite decent compared to rest of europe . 
  you 've had few very good movies in the past 10 years . 
  i keep forgetting , was it christians or persecution in general or we were circlejerking against ? 
  best live show i 've ever seen . 
   after lawrence walked out , the organizers , ** perhaps worried about adverse publicity ** , ran after him and persuaded him to come back , agreeing to let the three young men return to their seats in the `` women 's section '' . 
  imply much ? 
  this is logarithmic , and chance for linear one , showing values between 20 and 0 ? 
   basically , in theory , if you went for a walk around europe would n't recommend that , might fall off the edge of the world . 
  on the bright side , [ 41 % english , 39 % french and 35 % germans believe the same , with eu average of 32 % ] ( http://www.scribd.com/doc/35404242/42-of-romanians-are-geocentrists ) . 
  this is very relevant to uk though . 
  should we delete all posts about mali intervention as well ? 
  it is a very good analogy , and i can , to a degree , understand why argentina would do that . 
  going down that path of reasoning is very dangerous however , as it deprives people of the right of self-determination , regardless of reason behind it . 
  where do you draw the line between colony and sovereign population ? 
  both . 
  falklanders should be the ultimate autority . 
  this is analogous to spain not caring weather argentinians want to become spanish ( arguably again ) or not . 
   argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner has said the inhabitants ' wishes are not relevant in what is a territorial issue . 
  this has gone beyond stupid now . 
  of course there is a huge difference . 
  what i meant is , people in their 20 's tend to think they wont change . 
  they will , you get more conservative as you get older , your priorities shift and you generally lose much of your radicalism . 
  edit : typos, 
  think about 1968 , think about how radical that generation was , how different than their parents . 
  and then consider how tame they became later on . 
  they are the ones in power right now , and not much has changed . 
  i 'm not saying that 's a bad thing , what i mean is , young people often think they will stay the same as time goes on , and that 's not the case . 
   we 'll all be better off once the older generation dies off people have been saying that for at least 100 years . 
  do n't kid yourself , as young people grow older , they pretty much replace the old generation . 
  because soviet union did n't lose the war , its as simple as that . 
  first time in a club , the other guy was pretty drunk , but it wasnt serious . 
  the second time was scarier , i was going home through a ` bad ' part of town late at night and 3 guys punched me couple of times , apparently for ` looking gay ' . 
  pole here , got beat up twice for beeing gay , and i 'm not even gay . 
  jp ii 's beliefs were a product of our society . 
  besides , he was very moderate for polish standards . 
  hardly surprising , this actually sounds like something he would say . 
  czechs had a poet and a playwright , we have a homophobic and primitive electrician . 
  i suppose every country gets the kind of gandhi it deserves . 
  thanks !, 
  its asking me to log in , i 'm pretty sure i havent gone over article limit . 
  anyone have an article that is n't behind paywall ? 
  it is n't , but i cant think of any other instances where dutch army might have been remotely close to war crimes taking place . 
  these wouldnt be ` war ' crimes . 
  i think he meant srebrenica . 
  i honestly cant think of any war netherlands fought post-ww2 . 
  honestly , i never understood the fuss around the booklet , it did n't state anything new . 
  pretty sure you can attribute its impact to the fact that it hit the shelves just before christmas and became a popular gift . 
  i do admire him for his contributions to hr declaration though . 
  stop making me lean towards my screen . 
  could you translate the legend ? 
  i 'm curious what 's the exact question they asked . 
  i know that the percentage of parliamentary seats is the only objective way of measuring support for far-right , but it makes the list very incomplete . 
  there are many countries where nationalistic sentiment is even stronger , yet are unincluded in this map because of lack of political representation . 
   hwo knows they might go for other currency then like gbp why would anyone ditch their own currency in favour of adopting gbp ? 
  why should uk agree to that ? 
  its not like countries are adopting euro because they got fed up with their old currencies and were looking for something to replace them with ... 
  we start it at 18 , ba is 3 years and masters takes two more years . 
  some degrees are still unified masters , so they last 5 years alltogether . 
  there are longer degrees , most notably everything medicine-related , up to 8 years iirc . 
  i know , but that does n't bother me . 
  if anyone was interested in such data about me ( which i highly doubt ) , they could easily obtain it even without facebook . 
  what 's the worst that can happen , consumer profiling and targeted ads ? 
  lets say we have an exhibition opening . 
  i 'd have to call 1000 people to let them know about it . 
  or to let them know about a lecture . 
  with fb , its very easy to know what 's happening . 
  your argument is like saying 'em ail is useless , snailmail can accomplish pretty much the same ' . 
  yeah , it can . 
  it just takes much more time and is n't as effective . 
  bah , its an amazing tool to keep track of events in your city/parties/articles posted by sites you liked . 
  * wooooosh *, 
  are you bild 's journalist by any chance ? 
  you lost fifth of your population during occupation ? 
  is it because of some ** phony ** god 's blessing ? 
  [ well , in that case ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h48fsgb.jpg ),
