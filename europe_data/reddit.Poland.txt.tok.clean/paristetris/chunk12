  the von brauns see space as an instrument for grand diplomacy and international politics and prestige . 
  they prefer manned missions because they capture public imagination , but have no agenda beyond exploration . 
  ( indeed settlements make them feel a bit worried , because they have great risk and failure is worse than lower goals in their mind since it 's all about national prestige to them . ), 
  the o'neills do n't care about either science or politics , they have the goal settlements , colonization , industrialization of space . 
   until recent years , the o'neills have been the weakest of the three factions policy-wise and at most gained concessions by allying with the von brauns to maintain a human space program that might someday be compatible with their goals , and possibly develop some supporting technology that will pave the way for settlement eventually . 
  now , with a new space private sector involved ( and its own decidedly o'neill inspired industrial and settlement agenda largely independent of and impatient with the agenda of politicians ) , and with the augustine commission 's explicit statement that the goal of the space program is infact to expand human civilization through out the solar system , and with budget cuts constantly threatening pure-science space missions , the o'neills have finally become the dominant of the three factions . 
  as such , the vocabulary of the old space race ( competing nations engaged in what amounts to missions for mere prestige and exploration ) is simply out-dated . 
  the real ` new space race ' in the short term is this :  which company is going to build a true affordable and therefore fully reusable ( and i do n't mean fake-reusable like the shuttle ) launch vehicles . 
  the favorites are spacex ( with it 's grasshopper test of powered descent ) , and reaction engines ( skylon ) , but there are others with the declared intention of playing for this field ... xcor , stratolaunch , etc. 
  in the intermediate term , all of these efforts are also going to be profoundly effected by the companies that intend to reduce the need for heavy-launch from earth by sourcing material in orbit from asteroids . 
  and , in the long term , all of this is about settlements . 
  he 's living the dream, 
  [ germans ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=xsttaiiwdew ), 
  its all the eu institutions located there receiving the money . 
  now why would you say that ? 
  fuck yeah , we 're poor . 
  data for 2009 , best i could find : | member state | total amount ( mil $ ) | | : ----------- | : ------------ | | germany | \u2212 8,797 | france | \u2212 6,461 | italy | \u2212 6,046 | united kingdom | \u2212 3,865 | netherlands | \u2212 1,488 | denmark | \u2212 1,163 | finland | \u2212 606 | austria | \u2212 499 | sweden | \u2212 404 | ireland | \u2212 156 | cyprus | \u2212 27 | malta | 7 | slovenia | 189 | spain | 444 | slovakia | 481 | latvia | 495 | estonia | 558 | bulgaria | 589 | belgium | 968 | luxembourg | 1,167 | lithuania | 1,468 | czech republic | 1,575 | romania | 1,609 | portugal | 2,087 | hungary | 2,660 | greece | 3,009 | poland | 6,119, 
   put a euro in to get a shopping cart , and when you put it back you get your euro back . 
  how smart is that . 
  none of this crazy shopping cart madness i see in america . 
  wait , you dont have that in america ? 
  this sounds like houellebecq 's novel . 
  i still do n't get it , how does dividing registration periods even out the car sales during the whole year ? 
  these guys usually drive around in coaches . 
  or trains . 
  also , you do n't fly 747 's around europe . 
  yeah , cause flying from spain to germany takes ages , right ? 
  quick , someone take that picture on merkel and remake her into european version of uncle sam !, 
  no , you 're a bicycle !, 
  he was joking , bohemia is the historical name of western czech republic . 
  its called testament for a reason . 
  cant speak for jews , but christians believe it was written as a testament of things that happened . 
  authors were supposed to be apostles and christian scholars in first and second century ad . 
  old testament is believed to be written mostly by moses and a dozen other authors . 
  berlin . 
  trust me , you wont regret it . 
  this data is from 2009-2011 . 
  could someone explain to me the stark difference between brandenburg/anhalt and other lands of ddr ? 
  also , what 's going on around greifswald ? 
  btw , i like how they singled out koblentz for giving npd 33 % of votes . 
  turns out it has population of 248 . 
  of course its true . 
  for further details , refer to [ this documentary ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . 
  hold on , i messed up the submission, 
  wait , again ? 
  nah , i always loved the [ 1912-1959 version ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_flag_48_stars.svg ), 
  and they are arranged in 1959-1960 , [ 49-state pattern ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/us_flag_49_stars.svg ) ... 
  the distance is larger here . 
  gas may have huge muzzle velocity , but it has almost zero inertia . 
  you 'd kill him . 
  even blank bullets can be deadly at this distance . 
  as much as i love vice and shane , i 'd prefer him to stick to touring north korean film studios and hunting boars in chernobyl , not making political predictions . 
  we are not in pre-ww2 scenario . 
  this are n't 30 's . 
  from wikipedia  animals that * both * chew their cud ( ruminate ) and have cloven hooves are allowed ( kosher ) , whereas those that have only one of these two characteristics are considered unclean animals and jews are forbidden to eat them . 
  this is so confusing o.o, 
  jews cant eat pork as well . 
  til . 
  apparently , its because horses lack cloven hoof . 
   the dna tests found horse in the following products : tesco everyday value beef burgers , 29.1 % ; tesco beef quarter pounders , 0.1 % ; oakhurst beef burgers in aldi , 0.3 % ; moordale quarter pounders in lidl , 0.1 % ; flamehouse chargrilled quarter pounders in dunnes stores , 0.1 % ; two varieties of iceland quarter pounders , 0.1 % . 
  so apart from the first one , this is simply due to contamination caused by using the same production line ? 
  i always thought ` tesco everyday value ' label essentially meant ` eat at your own risk ' . 
  also , why the rage about horse meat while the pig one is the real issue here , due to religious prohibitions . 
  admittedly , i do n't know anything about housing situation in italy , could you explain a little bit further ? 
  edit :  i do n't really like that stereotype about italians . 
  ther 's nothing wrong with living with your parents if thats your cultural pattern . 
  [ this explains it pretty well . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/19/third-italians-live-with-parents ) it would be interesting to see data for north/south as well , cant seem to find it though . 
  this is exactly why i 'm attributing them , how else would you explain such high percentage in italy ? 
  its also closely corelated to housing availability and price per m ^ 2 / income ratio . 
  cultural patterns are visible as well , look at italians for example . 
  yeah , but on the other hand , they fought two extremely bloody wars over their colonies in algeria and indochina , each lasting almost 10 years . 
  why not , seems to work on / b /, 
  and transgender athletes . 
  this is an awesome answer , thanks for that . 
  also , i had to google halushki to see what it is , i suppose this proves that most of emigration came from particular parts of poland . 
  i doubt it , lots of poles in america , yet / r/poland is at 1,8 k, 
  polish internet is utter shit , ridden with ads , popups and ` like us on facebook ' crap . 
  its really good , as long as you get the start button plugin . 
  must have been apple maps . 
  just like prague . 
  and pilzen . 
  and paris , and a dozen other cities all over europe . 
  nowa huta , on the other hand , is unique . 
  it just depends on what you 're looking for in a city . 
  pubs and cafes ? 
  cant top warsaw . 
  cracow does have most beautifull old town of all polish cities , but then again , its nothing compared to other european tourist locations . 
  air might be getting better , but its still most polluted city in poland , due to lack of urban planning over centuries . 
  as i said , what makes it worth seeing are things you wont find anywhere else in , mainly nowa huta , a beautiful example of modernist architecture and cobusier-esque urban planning , couple of good museums ( mocak being the best contemporary art museum in poland , hands down ) , and probably the most interesting music festival , sacrum profanum . 
  honestly , roads are crap , whole city smells , and thers only couple of things unique and worth seeing . 
  mocak , bunkier sztuki , nowa huta and sacrum profanum are awesome , agreed , but other than that there is nothing you wont find in other cities . 
  and that 's coming from someone who lived there for 2 years . 
  what happened to that young guy who was bersani 's in-party opposition ( cant recall his name ) ? 
  anything but krakow , its grossly overrated and packed with tourists . 
  depending what you 're looking for , i 'd recommend warsaw/poznan/wroclaw / gdansk . 
  romania is pretty cool as well , especially bucharest and area around cluj . 
  its like an eclectic mix of most awesome and ugliest architecture next to each other , very inexpensive and the landscapes are incredible . 
  wouldnt recommend the sea though , i felt like i time travelled to mid-90s . 
  wasnt this posted here like 3-4 days ago and for some reason downvoted into oblivion ?
