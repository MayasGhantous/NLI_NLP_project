  i 'm actually raging right now , this is beyond ridiculous . 
  edit : apparently , op 's title was slightly off and its not as outrageous after all . 
  let me rephrase that : i suppose there are so many religious murders among protestant population . 
  i suppose thats why there are so many religious murders in all those protestant countries !, 
  its not about the code . 
  its how you interpret it . 
  dae religion bad atheism good ? 
  oh look , its this thread again, 
  they used to scare people with this whole idea that after our accession to eu germans would buy huge amounts of land in the west ( probably using jewmoney ^ tm ) , particularly around lower silesia and what used to be western brandenburg . 
  i guess they have n't heard about all the real estate in former ddr noone wants to buy . 
  then , around 2008 came the craze of heimatvertriebene ; at least that had some credibility , erika steinbach was doing everything she could to make herself look like some bizzare mix of count dracula and ewa braun . 
  and of course , there 's the famous `` grandfather from wehrmacht '' thing , where every now and then digging through historical archives reveals that someone 's ancestors served in german army during the war ( which is hardly surprising , since half a million did ) . 
  far-right politicians then proceed to insinuate that said person is in fact an undercover nazi and eats babies . 
  im sure a lithuanian will explain this in detail , but when poland and lithuania both regained independence in 1918 , a treaty was signed and both parties agreed on demarcation line that kept vilnus on the lithuanian side of border . 
  its a similar case as danzig/gdansk , the city had a lithuanian majority and polish minority . 
  its also worth noting , that vilnus was central to the idea of lithuanian independence in the beginning of xxth century . 
  during the war of 1920 , city was occupied by soviet army . 
  when it became clear the red army was defeated , they agreed to transfer the ownership back to lithuania . 
  however , polish head of state ordered one of the generals to [ fake a rebellion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbeligowski%27s_mutiny ) and occupy the city , thus dishonouring the treaty of 1918 and de facto invading lithuania . 
  poland created [ republic of central lithuania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania ) , installed a puppet government and had it agree to annexation two years later . 
  potatos !, 
  people in the east tend to be much more xenophobic towards russians and germans , that 's also reflected in the parties they vote on . 
  pis are the ones accusing russians of causing the 2010 plane crash and claiming germans are bunch of revisionists who want nothing but to buy out land in western poland . 
  edit : accidentaly a word, 
  no , [ it does n't ] ( http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/poland/georegionsmap.jpg ) . 
  the west is much more industrialized than the east , mostly due to internal policies of russia/austro-hungary and prussia . 
  this , and also the fact that western poland was treated by prussia as integral part of kingdom ( more or less ) while eastern part was considered somewhat ` temporal ' by russians ( which meant little industry would be built there ) led to differences in mentality which still can be seen today . 
  the cuisine is slightly different , the average amount of land each farmer owns , religiousness or even altitude towards neighbouring countries differ in east and west .

  mars one is n't going to happen . 
  just no . 
  no funding , no radiation shielding , no return capability . 
   because nasa was sitting on it 's collective asses for the last 30 years . 
  if they did n't stop that would ` nt have been an issue , and half earth 's space program would n't hang on a single private company known as space x working on a stringshoe budget just because the can . 
  they havent , they just mis-allocated their funding . 
  space shuttle looked great on blueprints and whatnot , but turned out to be a terrible idea . 
  what actually killed space program was race to the moon - before , nasa had a stepping-stone roadmap , with moonshot around 1980 's which was very reasonable and doable . 
  instead , we got a mad dash with insane funding which was cut once the political goal has been achieved and public interest was gone . 
   maybe we need an alternative low cost propulsion or launch system ? 
  i though nasa was looking for something like that ? 
  it might seems science fiction but i would ` nt be surprised we could put together a space plane or something ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skylon_ ( spacecraft ) ? ) . 
  or maybe we could find a way to just `` gun '' heavy hardware and raw materials in orbit to lower the costs ( using a railgun or somehting ) . 
  skylon looks alright but i wouldnt hold my breath , ssto concepts never turn out to be as good as they might appear during r&d . spacex has a more promising design , with [ fully reusable falcon 9 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssf81yjvbje ) . 
  their proof-of-concept demonstrator recently made a [ 40 metre leap ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4pexlodw9c ) . 
  at the moment , noone has sufficient launch vehicle . 
  assuming you go for single ascent/lor moonshot , you 'd need ~ 120 + tons to leo capability . 
  spacex 's falcon x heavy and falcon xx are at least a decade from beeing operational . 
  nasa 's sls is starting to look more and more promising . 
  currently , the cadaver of constellation program is beeing kind of ressurected ; early draft of schedule lists 2017 as a date for orion 's manned lunar flyby with free return trajectory and 2021 for orion manned lunar orbit . 
  neither of these are lunar landings , there is no lem beeing designed and altair was scrapped along with constellation . 
  2032 is an early date for sls block ii launch with 130t to leo capability . 
  using either this or one of spacex heavy launch vehicles you can start thinking about going to mars , multiple-launch leo ship assembly beeing the most probable option . 
  assuming no signifficant delays , you are looking at around 2040 as the earliest date for nasa manned mars mission . 
  chineese , on the other hand ... 
  xpost it to r/askwomen, 
  dude ... 
  up to 75 % of poles attend the midnight mass , if you believe the statistics . 
  this was declarative however , no data on how many of these actually attended . 
  32 on / r/conspiracy , 15 on / r/conspitard . 
  dont know weather these overlap , but i 'd say at least half of these people treat it seriously . 
  also , frederick ii hohenzollern - such a brilliant mind and interesting person . 
  a rather controversial pick . 
  this is taken out of context , and its not even the exact thing he said . 
  the actual quote was :  i believe that during intervention of nato in kosovo there is an element nobody can question : the air attacks , the bombs , are not caused by a material interest . 
  their character is exclusively humanitarian : what is at stake here are the principles , human rights which are accorded priority that surpasses even state sovereignty . 
  this makes attacking the yugoslav federation legitimate , even without the united nations mandate .

  you think nk is an eaqual society ? 
  really ? 
  but that 's not how democracy works . 
  what if we end up having a federated europe and part of it will end up having conservative bias ( and considering current eu borders its inevitable ) , would you ` welcome its splitting from the rest ' ? 
  as an outsider , i 'm amazed how quickly bavarians forgot 70 years ago they were primarily agricultural area and industrial north-west supported them . 
  i facepalmed when brazil popped up, 
  i used to be a volunteer couple of years ago . 
  its primarily a theatre festival , but they always have exhibitions and performances associated with current ` theme ' . 
  thers also a music concert at the end of it , and this year its kraftwerk . 
  if anyone misses out on those and lives anywhere near western poland , they have a [ gig in poznan ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/105985942900930/ ) on june 28th , tickets are around 50 $ . 
   lithuania was part of poland many years ago not exatly , they were both part of commonwealth . 
  noone 's butthurt , you just didnt give a single fact to back what you 're saying and instead resorted to offensive comments . 
  in fact , judging by the smileys in your comment above , you seem to be the one thats butthurt, 
  still , looking at pol pot 's cleavage makes me cringe, 
  what the fuck is this supposed to be ? 
  whoa , calm down . 
  comparing any elections in modern europe to germany 's 1933 is ridiculous and , unless something is lost i translation , the whole article feels way over the line, 
   who votes for people just because their different than all the other politicians people who are completely fed up with ` old ' political establishment, 
  atv uses 4 engines rated at 490 newtons , barely twice as much as your average rcs thruster and 13 times less powerful than oms . 
  but they 'll have to , unless they drag earth departure stage all the way to the moon . 
  maybe atv configuration is for leo only , and there will be something bigger used in lunar flights . 
  shuttle 's oms as propulsion for lunar insertion burn ? 
  with 26 kilonewtons compared to apollo 's 91 kn and orion being heavier than apollo , its going to take over 30 minutes to achieve ~ 1000m/s \u0394v . 
  why not use something more powerful ? 
  44/45 , cant remember where countries smaller than luxembourg are exactly . 
  [ kraftwerk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68c-r9kslne ) - germany [ m83 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx3k_qdnzhe ) - france [ hot chip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhasu2ojecq ) and [ ladytron ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlcjruo8aym ) - uk [ the knife ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcv3v6xfevm ) - sweden, 
  seriously though , can anyone explain the disproportion between hungary and rest of central europe ? 
  i thought all finns were at least slightly autistic, 
  [ he sometimes makes some good points in interviews though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixku194t040 ), 
  as a child , my grandpa and his friends thought the sign near their town during the war was a grave where a german named achtung minnen lies . 
  do you really need waffle stands to have a good time ?
