  no wonder us has been torn by constant civil war and riots for the past 150 years, 
  you realize that many countries ( yours included ) were much more multicultural prior to ww2 , right ? 
  japan is already re-militarizing , its not like anyone can do anything about it . 
  you 're making it sound like east asia needs babysitting , otherwise they will start nuking each other over meaningless rocky islands or something . 
  thank you pussy riot , you are my to-go political think tank . 
  its great from a distance , i 'd rather not see it in the making . 
  can confirm , posting leaked 2015 lego sets : [ one ] ( http://www.body-pixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/lego.jpg ) [ two ] ( http://users.erols.com/kennrice/lego-kz5.jpg ) [ three ] ( https://kuruc.info/galerian/egyeb/whololego6.jpg ), 
  some are . 
  poland is indonesia , germany is ddr , sweden is gay etc. 
  today 's flags are awesome too , whoever did them spent way too much time . 
  its the subtle stuff , like the romanian one . 
  left-wingers ( even moderates ) have always had a soft spot for russia , no matter what russia did . 
  i never understood why though . 
  edit : cant spell, 
  cause it was cheaper . 
  i also do n't know any details about the offset they offered . 
  often buying cheaper stuff is the best option , in that sense it might be the best in band-for-the-buck factor , but we do n't really know that . 
  except actual evaluations show it to be sub-par compared even to 4,5 gen planes . 
  bear in mind this is not something written by armchair general , this is a swiss air force 2009 evaluation leaked in 2012 . http://files.newsnetz.ch/upload//1/2/12332.pdf, 
  manned dragon flight to iss is planned for late 2015 and is currently on schedule . 
  in 2012 a swiss air force evaluation made in 2008 was leaked , presumably by air force personnel that was angry saab won the contract despite being the weakest plane by a large margin . 
  aircraft tested were typhoon , rafaele and grippen . 
  evaluation focuses mainly on avionics and capability to perform tasks air force would need them to . 
  rafaele came in first , with typhoon behind and grippen way in the back .

  mistral sale deal was struck years ago under vastly different circumstances , you cant really blame the french for fulfilling that contract . 
  angle and altitude are weird , these must be taken using another camera with shorter lens . 
  these are awesome , thanks for sharing . 
  the abbey of cassino is still standing , cant be after 1943 . 
  in fact these look like aerial recon photos . 
  what are these ? 
  i think you 're underestimating the [ difference between these two economies ] ( https://www.google.pl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:rus:deu:bra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  percentage of russians in crimea and the fact that tatars boycotted the referendum . 
  actually i think these numbers might be close to the truth . 
  you 'd expect something about 70 % backing the union or so . 
  why , what makes it superior ? 
  you mean why there are n't any kids ? 
  at a protest that might very well get violent ? 
  they often fuck up these counts and list everything that has tracks and is larger than a gaz as a tank . 
  i 've no idea how good or bad cnn is when it comes to us . 
  which one is reliable then ? 
  yes , because cnn and bbc are literally as bad as rt. 
  there 's bias and then there 's bias . 
  i said 20 's , not 30 's . 
  germany , 1920 's . 
  see the birth of modernist movement and bauhaus . 
  nope , this is all correct . 
  this was one of the few times their ban was justified . 
  can confirm this is clearly a lithuanian secret facility , as evidenced by basketball court . 
  its not in europe and they are n't white , so it does n't count . 
  plus there 's this whole mujahedeen ambiguity going on so we just pretend it did n't happen . 
  gas as well , doe and congress have to approve it if its not done already . 
  liquefied gas imports from us via port facilities . 
  gas pipes that bypass russia . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i 'm just explaining why people are buttmad . 
  thats because you were n't supposed to only declare war . 
  the treaty obliged you and france to attack germany within 14 days of declaring mobilization , which would be september 17th . 
  no-one is forcing you to go to any war , unless article 5 is invoked . 
  many nato countries opted out of iraq/libya interventions . 
  initial assessments might have been over-estimated , it 's possible its not even worth extracting from economical point of view . 
  its also possible we are sitting on largest supply of shale gas in europe , we need couple more years before we know for sure . 
  yeah , like those nato put in latvia and estonia , right ? 
  cant swing a dead cat without hitting a ballistic missile !, 
   but we 've voted to change that now , so ... you voted your oil reserves out of office ? 
  wow , these citizens are pretty well organized . 
  i guess these civil defense training classes at school go a long way , although mine did n't cover breaching doors, 
  have n't you heard , these helicopters were hijacked by concerned crimean citizens, 
  did i say i would ? 
  i just find it amusing that the threat comes from the very country that 's supposed to protect them . 
  except us did n't guarantee georgian independence . 
  they do guarantee ukrainian though . 
  russia wo n't intervene unless ukraine moves its troops to stabilize region . 
  funniest thing is , russia guarantees ukraine 's independence and integrity of its borders , in exchange for ukraine giving up its post-soviet nuclear stockpile, 
  curacao and pseudo kahlua ? 
   while on the programme the mp also made the mistake of saying malta was not a sovereign nation , but rather a small self-governing state within a larger country . 
  wow , good job . 
  at least she did n't mention knights hospitaller . 
  in these polls ` some sort of spirit or life force ' basicly means ` i 'd believe in god but i hate the catholic church ' . 
  either that or that 1 % of edgy wiccans/neopagans . 
  your graphs do n't match wiki data in few places , especially the `` i do n't believe there is any sort of spirit , god or life force '', 
  inb4 ` people my age are n't religious at all ' . 
  look , the people you interact with probably are n't an average person . 
  chances are , you have uni degree and live in a large city . 
  polls do n't lie , even though current generation is much less religious than previous one . 
  edit : although that 1 % hardcore atheists for poland seems strange . 
  i think it was wiemar triangle initiative . 
  sort of surprised sweden did n't tag along since they 're pretty invested in eastern partnership and whatnot . 
  or do masters in art and while studying do something that would actually improve your chances of being employed . 
  unpaid internships at art galleries and museums are n't that hard to get into . 
  instead , thsese assholes chose to circlejerk themselves to death at vernissages for 5 years straight . 
  no , send in foreign affairs ministers , just like they did . 
  maybe even ashton , who despite all the flak she recieves actually gets things done and is reliable . 
  so we just let it all happen , just like that ? 
  because someone else considers eu neighbor to be in its sphere of influence ? 
  first you whine about tame eu 's response and then suggest we avoid antagonizing russia , how does that even make any sense, 
  they sent 3 ministers of foreign affairs . 
  what else do you want them to do ? 
  truth is , eu cant apply any means of hard power outside of sanctions . 
  these kind of people drive me nuts .
