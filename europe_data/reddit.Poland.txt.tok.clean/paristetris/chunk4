  they finish their more or less useless masters in a world where there are 10 times as many students as there were when their parents studied , yet they expect to have same employment possibilities . 
  no , you are n't ` over-qualified ' . 
  you cant swing a hammer or use drill , you spent your past 5 years majoring in your hobby instead of doing something useful . 
  they just reported she died . 
  military versions are usually protected against this and much more , but this is police version , they might have had some hatches open , engine cover might not be secure etc. 
  so really its impossible to tell . 
  your planes are getting obsolete though . 
  even newer ones need an upgrade . 
  other options are more expensive . 
  although if you were to believe that leaked evaluation report , grippens are crap . 
  its really good , the trick is to put cloves and sour cherries in .

  dunno , 800 usd after taxes is pretty standard in poland, 
  why would they be , its not like any religion i know of claims sun goes around earth, 
  yes , that 's the case exactly . 
  these are n't international destinations , just european ones . 
  for poland , and i 'm sure for couple other countries as well , the top destination is egypt , not even arab spring could change that .

  man , i need to take a look at my poop before i flush it , this is very important . 
  yeah i meant slavic orthodox , should have made that clear . 
  also , i always thought romania is roughly half and half catholic/orthodox , do n't know why . 
  catholic countries used latin alphabet , orthodox ones used cyrillic . 
  all slavic catholic countries use special marks , i think czechs and slovaks have even more than we do . 
  countdown was spot-on , the one displayed in the corner was off . 
  notice how ignition is at 00:00, 
   you do n't know when the rocket is going to lift off exactly i dont think you understand how launch procedures work . 
  its all synced down to a hundredth of a second . 
  chinese and russians countdown to liftoff as well , so its pretty much standard . 
  thats why its weird . 
  ariane launches are always weird , how they countdown to ignition instead of liftoff, 
  people thought the same thing at the beginning of xx century . 
  of course you cant . 
  but this few hundred is what people will remember , just like last year . 
  the problem is that the organizers cant do anything to prevent this from happening every year . 
  and dont even get me started on the police , holy shit , they have like 5 sites that can be problematic along the route of march and they fail to protect two of them , one of which is 100 meters from a police station and the second one is supposed to be protected by vienna convention,

  [ this one is actually really good ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ioihaf.jpg ), 
  yeah , but that does n't invalid them . 
  its not chevron 's concern ; they got permission , they drill . 
  if people are angry , they should take it to government officials . 
   in neighboring romania we 1939 now they have a point , cheveron had permissions from government to drill .

   its their country . 
  if they dont want foreigners living there , then good luck to them . 
  il cross it off my list . 
  no big deal . 
  i hate to use this comparison , but would you say the same about anti-semitic sentiment many countries had in 1930 's ? 
  german police released the news today , they probably milked the fact that buyers were unaware of the whole affair to make further arrests and possibly recover some sold paintings . 
  there 's a lot of shady stuff going on around buying and selling art all over europe , i know this from personal experience . 
  young artist auctions are great way to launder money for example .

  call me naive , but russia and mexico are the big surprises here .

  no , she did n't . 
  nsa jerk is really getting annoying , especially since it spilled all over the media . 
  at least it did n't lose 75 % of its value over 3-day period . 
  they put holes in them and then ran a string through the coins so that they would n't be lost . 
  airstrip was made out of really high-grade concrete . 
  after it was abandoned i remember reading about local farmers stealing huge slabs of runway , although i have no idea how or why . 
  i 've heard the same thing from some western europeans about poles . 
  it is , just slightly . 
  or rather so little forest left . 
  think about how that changed over the last 2000 years , it always blows my mind . 
  edit : exclude sweden and finland , suddenly forest percentage drops by about 10 %, 
  you just did it again , twice . 
  this contempt and arrogance from both sides has everything to do with how politics work . 
  calling people idiots just because they have different political beliefs is another annoying trait of polish politics . 
  and the leader of anti-communist inteligentsia . 
  essentially polish havel . 
  i still consider electing walesa over him as president in 1990 as the original sin of polish democracy .

  i 've no idea , i only remember hearing ecologists say that they are concerned . 
  some geologist replied its unlikely as water and gas deposits are on different depth . 
  i think the major complaint ( apart from ` flames in my tap ' ) was that the chemicals used in fracking contaminate groundwater .
