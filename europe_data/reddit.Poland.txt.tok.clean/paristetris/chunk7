  cria cuervos by saura . 
  one of my all-time favourites, 
  * their language sounds like italian mixed with latin * they were the only eastern block country to go through violent revolution in 1990 * their streets are full of cables , for some reason . 
  it almost looks like these power lines tie cities together and without them everything would fall apart * awesome food , i cant stress this enough * roman settlement and a star fort with brewery built on top of it in alba iulia * 90 % of romanian contemporary art is located in a single building in cluj . 
  as someone put it : if a bomb were to go off in there , whole romanian modern art movement would cease to exist * oil fields in ploesti . 
  driving through that region you can see texas-style pumpjacks working . 
  they got bombed hard in ww2, 
  obolon , that brewery . 
   botteled kvass is a poison how come ? 
  sure , it does n't come close to homemade one but its still great, 
  bread kvass, 
  * 87 % alde * 80 % epp 93 % with irish fine gael party, 
  thats different , its not like bundestag members are selling their votes, 
  that may be so , but it was n't a popular option back when it was proposed . 
  point is , regardless of its economic merit or lack thereof , it was ridiculous from a political point of view . 
  they are balancing on the 5 % margin , few days ago they scored 3,2 % in bavaria . 
  genscher retired and they have noone to replace him with , whole westerwelle affair was handled poorly and they tried to push so ridiculous ideas such as lowering taxes in the middle of crysis . 
  right now they are begging cdu voters to cast their second vote ( you vote once for candidate and once for party ) on fdp . 
  well the public support for abortion is actually [ decreasing ] ( http://www.rp.pl/artykul/17,1038458-przyzwolenie-na-aborcje-maleje-w-polsce.html ), 
   i suspect a lying government agency . 
  no way . 
  these numbers are monitored by a number of organizations , many of them pro-choice . 
  the most recent figure i could find was 641 in 2010 . 
  that seems believable , since even if you are in a situation where abortion would be legal , you need to find a doctor willing to perform it ( physicians can opt-out of performing it without any consequences ) within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy . 
  the unofficial numbers of illegal abortions are around 100 thousand , 15 % of which are performed abroad . 
  it was , but that doesnt mean poland as a country got invaded . 
  wiki says its larger than romania , and poland wasnt invaded during ww1 since it didnt exist during 1795-1918 ... 
  ] ( http://s3.flog.pl/media/foto/2998922_pustynia-bledowska.jpg ) an actual desert right in the middle of europe . 
  afrika korps trained there prior to the departure to africa . 
  it was invaded before , not during the ww2 , its pretty much all hills and mountains , did n't exist during ww1 ( and arguably during german invasion as well ) . 
  wisent ? 
  neighbour of germany ? 
  poland did n't exist during ww1 and its larger than romania ... 
  cars have nothing to do with gas . 
  they are still doing the preliminary drilling , but reserves might have been overestimated . 
  europe can start importing liquefied shale gas from usa , as soon as congress gives a go-ahead to export it . 
  check out inbreeding in finland, 
  his name aside , this really has nothing to do with / r/europe, 
   the tension and disagreement is almost exclusively on the political level really ? 
  [ less than month ago ] ( http://www.futbolnews.pl/gfx/futbolnews/pl/defaultaktualnosci/307/612/1/956676103.jpg ) . 
  not to mention ` wilno nasze ' or all the phantom pains poles experience every now and then ... 
  or perhaps badblueboy146 thinks these lyrics are complete bull, 
  thank you , captain obvious !, 
  corpus christi , they set up one of the stations in front of biedronka for some reason . 
  [ sacrificial altar is already up ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/61/de/d5/z14016097q,oltarz-na-procesje-bozego-ciala.jpg ), 
  i always wondered , is there any difference between aldi nord/sud , apart from cigarettes ? 
  dont know about uk , but over here they have ` themed ' weeks every now and then , like asian , german , english , mexican , american etc. 
  lidl . 
  yes . 
  they guy at 1:15 is just perfect, 
  they already narrowed it down to one of 3 possible locations . 
  scheduled to start operations in 2024 . 
  research reactors are n't included in this map , at least judging by poland . 
  uk had lots of 50 's -60 's era powerplants that had to be shut down, 
  implying there are too many reactors in europe . 
  also , you cant compare power plants being build today with those build in 70s or even 90s . 
  thats like saying steam engine and internal combustion engine are the same cause they both use fossil fuels . 
  i have a painting of him . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  mouse over snoo . 
  it changes from time to time .

  it changed as soon as i posted it .

  yup , [ spx instant screen capture 6 ] ( http://screen-capture-software-review.toptenreviews.com/spx-instant-screen-capture-review.html ) is pretty cheap and you can screencap with only few clicks of a mouse !, 
  the real problems for russia are yet to come . 
  us is in the middle of refitting their lpg port installations in gulf of mexico to allow them to export gas , instead of importing it as originally conceived 15 years ago . 
  with huge surplus of shale gas , as soon as congress approves its exports , i 'm sure there will be plenty of european countries lining up to buy it from someone who does n't charge an arm and a leg nor throttles the supply as a method of pressure . 
  thanks . 
  apparently i 've reached article limit , could someone paste the whole thing pretty please ?

  when elections come around , the german minority becomes a topic right-wingers talk about a lot . 
  right now its a non-issue .

  [ fuck you , san marino !,

  dj bobo and lsd . 
  he just posted in wrong sub, 
  second opinion bias .

  paris is the most overhyped city i 've been to .

   i 'm not saying i support it but i can understand it . 
  if there ever was ` near abroad ' , its ukraine ** ( or at least eastern half of it ) ** . 
  huge russian population , russian language used more widely than ukrainian and the fact that it has been part of the russia/soyuz since late 17th century that * is * what i meant . 
  whole ukraine was n't always part of russia . 
  my sentence would make more sense if there was a colon after the brackets instead of a full stop . 
  yeah , i meant the eastern half of the country .

  which government is that ? 
  so how is belgian economy doing these days ? 
  their debt was higher than ireland 's and portugal 's . 
  [ someone over at mr actually believes its a conspiracy ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/1k388x/so_apparently_theres_this_fish_that_especially/ ), 
  i had to google it  benadryl is also known to be a very common ingredient used to mix with heroin to make the drug cheese . 
  well that sounds nice .
