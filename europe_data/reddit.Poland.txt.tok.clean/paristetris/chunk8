  ** pozna\u0144 : ** paul von hindenburg, 
  this is awesome , like lecorbusier 's wet dream, 
  biggest problem is that the decision which colour to use is usually done by the workers painting the buildings . 
  back where i live a group of architects actually started a project to have them painted in some reasonable manner , and it [ looks great ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=52.415587,16.884388&amp;spn=0.005412,0.009645&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.415555,16.884528&amp;panoid=tmpf9omkdlztnsiwunqi_w&amp;cbp=12,320.95,,0,-7.84 ) . 
  just ignore those in the background .

  at least it was n't editorialized, 
  there was still a significant jewish population in poland after the ww2 . 
  in 1967 however , after the six day war , poland started an anti-semitic campaign ; they were given a 1-way ticket and permission to leave . 
  what remained of the diaspora left by the end of 1970 's . 
  anti-roma comments in / r/europe are nothing compared to / r/worldnews, 
  most comments here are calling it an idiotic act , so i would n't say these are appreciated values . 
  foreign citizens = / = minority . 
  i think this is the number of expats . 
  that kind of wurst is hard to get though . 
  also , add some worcester sauce , it makes all the difference . 
  i have no idea why [ currywurst ] ( http://www.gablinger.com/currywurst.jpg ) never became popular outside germany . 
  no , that is not what i think . 
  i fail to see how this is relevant to the story . 
  a bus crashed killing at least 38 people and you still manage to find part of it ironic ? 
  homophobic and religious . 
  poles on reddit will tell you its mostly old people but that 's merely because they do n't interact with religious folk on daily basis ; surveys show something different . 
  and while it is true less and less people attend masses , they still identify themselves as religious and declare they would baptise their children and raise them as catholics and homophobia is widespread even on universities these days . 
  they actually change the whole undercarriage on border between poland and wide-gauge countries . 
  [ 89 millimetres from europe ] ( http://vimeo.com/14860003 ) shows one of these depots back in 1993 . 
  all of them ? 
  including extremists ? 
  why was n't anyone raging when it turned out norwegian intelligence knew that brevik was buying materials to manufacture explosives ? 
  the point is , they monitor all suspicious activity , weather these individuals know about it or not . 
  it could be buying large amounts of fertilizer . 
  or it could be holding rallys in front of intel outposts . 
  it does n't mean they will act upon it . 
  he organized a small rally near nsa 's outpost . 
  i 'd be more surprised if that didnt get him the attention of intel agencies . 
  they asked to come to his house to ask him questions , which he was n't even obliged to answer , or to have that conversation at all . 
  what i 'm saying is this is what agencies do , this is how they operate . 
  this is how they have been operating for decades . 
  would you rather have them not investigate any activists ? 
  yes , and how were they acting on it ? 
  they are monitoring political activism and potential extremism . 
  this is what they do , and do n't act surprised now and pretend they were n't gathering intel on activists for the past 60 years . 
   the people in power are monitoring political activism yes , thats what intelligence is supposed to do  and are already acting on it if it does n't serve their interests . 
  citation needed besides , remember raf or those neo-nazis who were killing immigrants in eastern germany couple of years ago ? 
  it was a joke . 
  look at the date ; it was illegal to leave japan until 1868 , and no foreigners were allowed in prior to 1850 . 
  if i were to take a guess , this is a poor copy of a map brought by foreigners to japan . 
  i actually like it . 
  great font and perfect choice of motto . 
  i suppose this is why japan is n't known for its explorers . 
  europe grew slowly in xxth century just like asia will slow down in xxi . 
  you always start with high birthrate and infant mortality , then medicine kicks in and mortality drastically falls down . 
  population spikes and then stabilizes at a certain level . 
  actually not that much higher . 
  without the war you probably would not see such high baby boom in late 40 's and 50 , it takes about 2-3 generations to make up for the casualties ( which were n't that high considering the big picture ) but in the long run it all evens out , as terrible as this sounds . 
  its usually famine and epidemics that have more severe impact . 
  watt patented the steam engine ... 
  majority of europeans believe that eiffel tower is europe 's most important building , except french , who think its brandenburg gate ? 
  this is either a typo or hilarious . 
  eu has member states . 
  you can either have functional intelligence services , or complete transparency . 
  by not having counter-intelligence services you completely expose yourself to other intelligence agencies . 
  that would be technological espionage paradise , your politicians would be constantly spied on etc. 
  its almost as if by joining eu you vow to uphold a certain democratic standard , apart from all those precious cohesion funds and whatnot . 
   language wise i didnt mean it lingustically , but with that train of thought you could go very far back and connect most every language . 
  you could , but that would mean missing the point . 
  there are certain similarities and common roots languages within a group and family share . 
  swedish is more similar to german than to finnish , cause its the same group . 
  swedish is more similar to spanish than mandarin , because its the same family , etc. 
   i dont share your languages , i dont share your history very much , i dont share your modern after-war history . 
  how come ? 
  sweden was n't really isolationist up to 20th century and you share language group with germans , brits and few others . 
  by after-war history i assume you mean social democracy , which is a fair point . 
  not taking any action is an action as well . 
  besides , apparently they either had fuel problem or faulty fuel indicator , and decided to make a fuss about it . 
  remember its morales we 're talking about . 
  you know about it only because of a leak . 
  nsa 's activities are n't public . 
  at a risk of sounding like a cynic asshole , this is what intelligence agencies do . 
  and yes , despite its name nsa is an intelligence agency as well . 
  do you honestly think that given an opportunity , european intelligence would n't bug us embassies ? 
  obama scrapped the whole idea of missile shield . 
  there used to be patriot batteries stationed in poland along with their crews , but those were pac-2 version which is unfeasible for shooting down missiles . 
  therse are gone now as well , american fighter jets replaced them last year . 
  they already deployed iskanders to kaliningrad as a response to missile shield . 
  [ diagram showing their range . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/iskander_range.jpg ), 
  what about kaliningrad and bases in estonia/lativia ? 
  you could argue that nato has bases 40 km off russian border . 
  greek, 
  i used to do that , cuts down the cost about tenfold , depending on the tobacco and taxes . 
  [ w po\u0142udnie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vhmbpdsytw ), 
  you forgot the ` germans have no sense of humour ' . 
  i actually know a few of the people associated with the movement and this article is spot on . 
  never before had i met anyone so disconnected from reality as they were , alone and sad , but at the same time idealistic . 
  people in their 30 's tackling issues they have no real idea about , i 'm not even surprised the very people they were trying to help were disturbed by their ideas and appearance . 
  the whole thing feels like a time machine , like 1950 's guerillas in some banana republic , except this time the villagers hate them , there is no big man they can fight , and no happy ending is possible . 
  its one of the reasons why i said it .
