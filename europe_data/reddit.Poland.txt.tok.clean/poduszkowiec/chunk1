very good . 
  we have enough of monopolists and price fixing on the market already . 
  i vowed to vote for her if she posed for playboy . 
  she did n't . 
  also unknowingly to the people frequenting the site , [ wykop ] ( https://wykop.pl ) . 
  watch out for korwin yourself . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j__zdvszae ) is the katyusha my communist uncle tortured me with ... 
  or gu\u0142ag ... 
  no one is ever done growing up . 
  as you grow up , you 'll learn that beauty can be found everywhere , in any kind of music . 
  even disco-polo . 
  what do you mean exact opposite ? 
  music is not math , you ca n't really say one thing is opposite of another . 
  every genre lives beside the rest ... 
  are you talking about the video , lyrics , or the song as a whole ? 
  * we do n't need no water , let the motherfuckers burn * ? 
  what the article did n't mention , is that it 's all very fucking expensive ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6km-ddfjntk is n't it a big stereotype already that * maniury * crave that foreign dick ? 
  the title shoud be :  unease with islam on the rise in france and germany , new poll finds , or : * du-uh !, 
  and kaczy\u0144ski behind the wheel is any better ? 
  the truth is , pis was supposed to be no worse than po , but look at what they are doing to our country right now ... 
  cs 1.6 on a phone ? 
  how the fuck does that work ? 
  i live in something like that . 
  the fence wo n't stop burglars , but it will stop kids from nerby school . 
  [ git off my lawn . 
  this is not \u017bubr\u00f3wka ... : /, 
  polish death camps , etc. . . 
  but he 's somewhat right : i clearly see the rise of nationalism , racism etc. 
  amongst my friends and colleagues . 
  just because they are corrupted to the point it 's basically an oligarchy , does n't mean it 's not true . 
  who are you trying to lie to . 
  cebulandia is the only name . 
  farage is being an ass again ? 
  no way , how could this be ? 
  and they 're not the same ? 
  hahahaha !, 
  korwin-mikke may be a mentally challenged sociopath and an idiot like farage , but he 's right about one thing : pis and po are the same kind of corrupt , nepotistic bastards . 
   the government that swept to power on an anti-migrant and populist spending platform in october elections . 
  i think that most people do n't understand how significant this is . 
  pis is ruling the country right now because of the same tactics that made brexit happen . 
  it 's not democracy at that point , it 's ochlocracy . 
  fueled by demagogy and populistic media . 
  stupid people , stupid decisions ... 
  look at what happens at my country and at yours , and tell me that we should still allow *** stupid people *** to vote . 
   hardcore apokries celebrations tell us more . 
  yes , a good , new , old-school rpg is just what greek economy needs . 
  do n't worry . 
  it 's legal in america and look how great that country turned out to be . 
  holy shit , that 's fantastic !, 
  would you be willing to do a little ... * reddit gift exchange * , mona for kalimoczo ( amarena + cola original ) ? 
  well ... 
  i do n't really like wine , so i ca n't really say about the quality of said wine . 
  the 4 pln wine i had on my mind is [ amarena ] ( http://c.wrzuta.pl/wi17932/0bde1148000ae63650eeac1b ) , which i sometimes drink 50/50 with cola , a drink called kalimoczo . 
  500 pln would buy you 25 bottles of wine ... or 125 , depending on the wine . 
  i 've been laughing all my life already ... 
  just every time i hear pis does anything , it 's either paranoia ( like here ) or something absolutely ethically repulsive . 
  oh god , time to get the fuck out of here . 
  do n't give this stupid mother fucker any more ideas !, 
  amarena + cola is a drink . 
  and it 's ** w\u00f3dka ** , you heathen !, 
  actually the mix is pretty tasty . 
  come on , have n't you heard of kalimoczo ? 
  amarena + cola original . 
  best drink for woodstock . 
  i take a whole canister each year . 
  some people call it karamuczos , but poznaniacy are already weird . 
  oh , come on !, 
  this is golden . 
  somebody give this man gold , because i ca n't afford it ( developing country and such ) . 
  what you 're saying is total bullshit . 
  i did n't even bother reading it all . 
  that 's because he does n't have the same power like they do . 
  i bet he 'd have no problem with throwing * undesirable * people in the slammer . 
  i understand what you 're going through . 
  have my vote . 
  they are not far-right-wing . 
  they are far-up-their-arseholes . 
  omg , if the first chick changed her name to mallory it would be fucking perfect ... 
  it 's actually 15 ... 
  my friend went to work in the netherlands . 
  he says he has to tell chicks he meets at bars and such he 's esti just so they do n't immediately walk away ... 
  `` why do poles hate russians so much ? '', 
  works on me . 
   kleptostate oh god this is perfect . 
  xd edit : after a thorough research ( quick google search ) it turns out it actually is a [ thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleptocracy ) ... 
  you want proof ? 
  look at your phone . 
  now look back into the 60 's . 
  the space race , fueled by american taxpayer 's money . 
  it greatly increased the speed of development of microchips and other such things , without which your computer would n't exist . 
  people who think like you do , who think that we should n't focus on and fund development of new technologies , are ... hindering our evolution as a species . 
  a lot of the actions done by the ak in the wwii would be considered terrorism by today 's standards . 
   massive amounts of taxpayer funds to get developed and deployed . 
  you mean the money that we 'll be able to save once this technology arrives ? 
  when will people start to look into the god damn future instead of the past ? 
  no fucking clue . 
  i 'm from the north though . 
  i just wish we focused more on energy sources that are much more efficient , like nuclear . 
  fusion reactors are just behind the corner !,
