i wonder if [ ogres ] ( http://orig09.deviantart.net/48e0/f/2012/016/4/c/forest_ogre_by_guzboroda-d4mj5xj.jpg ) are connected to this etymology . 
   what 's the bar confeferation ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bar_confederation ) coming to the rescue . 
  every suicidal uprising in the past . 
   a russian cinematography superproduction titled `` 1612 '' . 
  which was quite universally panned . 
  you germans and your weird fetishes . 
  actually it was because stalin decided greece is not worth it . 
  greek communists disagreed , unfortunately . 
   the poles are like tokienesque fantasy `` dwarves '' . 
  unfortunately , we 're also prone to doom-resulting scenarios . 
  like digging up the moria . 
   russians still ca n't forgive poland taking over moscow in 1610 . 
  no they do n't . 
  no russian i spoke to ever ** knew ** about that . 
  and unity day date was picked mostly because of coincidence with previous october revolution day . 
  russians having `` big grudge about 1612 '' is something blown out of proportion by our own russophobes . 
  it 's like steinbach - obscure in germany , made a big scarecrow in poland . 
   it 's like successfully picking up a hot hollywood actress at some point in the past only like it happened before she became hot . 
  so denmark & norway used fraktur , but iceland used antiqua ? 
  is it correct ? 
   while i 'm unsure about the albanian language there was a [ project ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daut_bori%c3%a7i ) , but it did n't catch on ( same with few original ideas , e.g. 
  [ elbasani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbasan_alphabet ) alphabet or [ beitha kukju ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vithkuqi_alphabet ) ) . 
  it seems that before 20th century albanians used either latin , or greek alphabet . 
   it does appear that the bosnian language previously used the arabic alphabet : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arebica, 
   if we to be believe statistics that were posted here long time ago , 40 % of poland hates everyone ( including poland ? ) . 
  it 's true , but chinese come nowhere among top hated nationalities . 
  actually their `` liked/not liked '' ratio is [ kind of similar ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg ) ( poll from mid-2015 ; yellow = liked , gray = neutral , red = not liked , black = no answer ) . 
   thus we would like to sell this clay , so if you are buying unfortunately we have derptowns of our own . 
  like radom or sosnowiec :(  like our personal dis-utopia you mean [ dystopia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dystopia ) , 
   i find it hilarious that vaslui is famed for its ` traditions ' care to explain ? 
  you know , there are other people than romanians & hungarians here ... 
   we would need a name for a new state . 
  cozy hollow of huey , dewey & louie . 
   i did n't notice it :( . 
  who would have expected so many south slavic so far to the north ? 
  because present south slavs came from the north ? 
  there is a strong theory , that split of slavic tribes happened roughly in area of present polesie , probably about 4rd-5th century ad . 
  some tribes ( = ancestors of west/east slavs ) stayed there or went a little west/east/north , and some ( = south slavs ) have gone far south . 
  and by the way , it shows the point of researching haplogroups well . 
  that you should n't consider them a `` genetic/racial '' map , but a way to notice ** migration patterns ** . 
  if you have visible number of given haplo in two distant areas , it probably means that somewhen in the past there was a significant flow between them ( in either direction ) . 
  it 's sometimes also helpful , when you try to determine the order of successive `` waves '' . 
   yet , we are more slavic than the serbs themselves . 
  unless you count slavic with south slavic . 
  then it 's belarus . 
   as long as it spares us from taking in isis terrorists you 're a proof that scaremongering works here very well . 
  government shows you a bugbear , so you wo n't notice ( or even willingly agree ) taking away of your rights . 
   nearly all judges were picked by previous government most of them were picked in agreement , both by ruling coalition and pis . 
  check votings on sejm webpage . 
  nearly whole pis voted for rzepli\u0144ski . 
   where democratic decision in referendum can be ignored and changed by high court ? 
  and do n't you wonder , why nobody ever tries to impair high court rulings in usa ? 
  why it 's a big no-no ? 
   czechs have not stopped resisting . 
  may be i should use verb `` fighting '' . 
   we are a smaller nation smaller , but with comparably rich culture . 
  every rule has its exceptions . 
  who knows ? 
  czechs stopped resisting for a long time 400 years ago , and they pretty much still exist where they were then . 
  nationalism is about a ** nation ** , which is a subjective , often even vague concept . 
  nationalists often decide , who 's excluded from it in their opinion . 
  while patriotism is rather about a country , so there is an objective , determined group of ** citizens ** . 
  patriots ca n't decide who 's the citizen , and who 's not . 
  of course these are n't clear differences , as e.g. 
  you can be a local patriot . 
  but in general , patriotism tends to be inclusive , while nationalism is more exclusive . 
   i 'm talking about having pride in your culture/country and wanting to preserve it 's culture not hating on other countries and wanting to destroy theirs or anything like that . 
  such thing ( appealing to identity of country , state ; but also possible with region , city , or in our case eu ) is called ** patriotism ** . 
  nationalism is about a ** nation ** . 
   i heard that poland went through some tough austerity back then - tougher than it used to be in ukraine . 
  yeah , but it did n't last long , at least in major areas . 
  it was a big problem in towns where population was sustained by one or two big companies , e.g. 
  factories which were to be shut down ( and most often there was no alternative , because either products of these companies were outdated , or no longer profitable in free-market economy ) . 
  outbursts of freedom . 
  what is left of majdan atmosphere now , after two years ? 
   i 'm with you . 
  poland wanted change as a nation when the warsaw pact fell . 
  i think it was rather , that we have fallen into a shithole ( in late 1970s ) rather quickly , so wanted to get up quickly as well . 
  while ukrainians have rather sunk slowly , gradually ... and that made them more passive . 
  plus , we were always clear , that west is the goal . 
   problem is that ukrainians are too content content ? 
  i 'd rather say they are just passive . 
   i strongly recommend his shock therapy to ukraine . 
  problem is that we were at least a little ready and eager for shock therapy ( although it still was a very bumpy ride ) , because of fresh remembrance of economic shithole poland was in late 1980s . 
  i 'm not sure ukrainians are as ready . 
  because we need strong eu and you 're an important , albeit grumpy and estranged , member of family . 
  oh yeah ... ru\u017ean / na = ugly in hr/sr/ba ( and `` false friend '' word btw , because r\u00f3\u017cny / na = different , various in pl ) . 
  i thought there 's one word '' \u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438 '' . 
  ... but what has prometheus to do with macedonia ? 
  are you greek now ? 
  i wanted to make a joke about brandenburg gate ( probably [ involving ] ( http://historia.focus.pl/upload/galleries/1/foto-east-news-1586_l.jpg ) our flag . ) . . 
  but i 'm not that cruel . 
  not much in polish media , either , except small coverage on tvn24 . 
  but it 's nothing suprising , as our attention is extremely introvertive for last few months ... 
  `` rushnavi e portata '' - what does it mean ? 
  also , who 's the guy with a torch ( statue ) ? 
  naaah , nobody can beat un in who-gets-last races . 
  it is called an union sometimes . 
  like yearly * state of the union * speech ( something like * urbi et orbi * , but by potus instead of pope ) .
