  give me an example of a man masked in that way ( helmet , balaclava , etc. 
  ) , fined with similar amount of money . 
   and even secularism in europe secularism should mean not making religions influence the state law , not a state persecuting people 's personal beliefs . 
  even if those are stupid . 
  freedom to be stupid is a freedom too . 
   that 's a huge fine , i do n't know if it is a reasonable amount though . 
  even default fine of 600 euro is ridiculous . 
  do we really think , that wearing a cloth over face is worse offense , that e.g. 
  speeding 200 km/h , or running a red light ? 
  it was a rather common comment after our elections a year ago - at least in web , because major press of course avoided it due to pc . 
  maybe not exactly `` failed '' , but something like `` they did n't grow up to democracy '' . 
  yeah , but pis is not ruling a major world power . 
  good , but really different . 
  still , rockstar does n't disappoint . 
   i looks like an insanely modded gta , or the watchdogs we never had . 
  mafia ii , before the jail . 
  friendship bracelet maybe ? 
  and if i 'm not mistaken , at least three of these four are considered to be among worst presidents ( while one - eisenhower - is an average one ) . 
  great ... not . 
   you 're going under the assumption that somehow europeans wo n't vote for populist parties . 
  if we move core of political power from national parliaments to ep , the risk will be much smaller . 
  it would be hard to build multinational populist euro-party . 
   fml i 'm afraid for my country . 
  but yeah , it 's kind of freezing . 
  let 's hope nato borders will count for something . 
   we do n't have either in this case . 
  was there any other potus without experience in any office ( congress , senate , governor , secretary ) , or military career ? 
  even reagan was a governor before . 
  at least we are n't going down alone ... 
  while poland is no longer `` failed eastern democracy '' . 
  we are just another `` failed western democracy ''  yaaaay for us ... 
  i did n't invent it . 
  we in poland have :( but tbh , pis starts to look really less bad in comparison with orange hitler ... 
  and make a war about scania , again . 
  in such case , you should support macedonian bid . 
  you 're kind of useful if we aim for cultural victory . 
  all these monuments ... 
  so poland could finally into space !, 
   i thought it was us germans who didn \u00b4 t understand irony ... having sarcastic neighbors on both sides probably helped . 
   `` we are proud of not being proud '' tbh it 's actually quite deep sentence for a satiric song . 
  true , but i prefer [ be deutsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqkv5ctuoy ) . 
  he also had good one about german police , in [ german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4w5cqm3f_c ) , but there are subtitles . 
  britain prevails . 
  \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is actually awesome in this field , they have a whole [ program ] ( http://galeriaurbanforms.org/ ) . 
  strength through unity , unity through faith . 
   tbh people who comment on newspaper sites in any country are the lowest of the low . 
  meh , they 're still standing on the heads of youtube commenters . 
  it could be very misleading . 
  in polish * czasem * means `` sometimes '' , * cz\u0119sto * `` frequently '' , * na czas * `` on time '' etc. 
  hey , we are not ** that ** retarded :(, 
  not really , pretty much every language has its own word for `` now '' . 
  yeah , * \u010derez * is russian for `` over '' . 
  and * teper ' * is `` now '' . 
  i speak polish ( native ) , russian ( good ) and some rusty croatian ( one year faculty , did n't finish ) . 
  and i have no problem in ** reading ** any slavic language ( speaking is another matter ) . 
  of course it helps , that those are from three different groups ( western/eastern/southern ) . 
  in polish * no\u017cyce * are big scissors ( standard ones are * no\u017cyczki * , dimunitive ) . 
   slavic cursing mostly concentrates on sex workers , orifices and genitals regardless of gender or sexual orientation . 
  and sometimes it 's really over the edge . 
  for example croats ( or serbs too ? ), 
  have curses like * jebi gospu * ( fuck holy mary ) , or * jebo ti bog mater * ( god will fuck your mother ) . 
  tbh we poles are quite boring , pretty much with * kurwa * only :|, 
   slavic languages need to be main subject in western european schools ... guys , we should n't be so cruel . 
  come on . 
  something something jai hind ? 
  * india triggered *, 
  polan not relevant enough ;(, 
  there are numbers of those kind in pis - loyal party members in prl ( people 's republic of poland ) , loyal party members now . 
  1952 ) , pzpr 1978-89 , prosecutor in 1980s ( a.o. 
  charged opposition activists ) , pis senator / mp since 2005 , now chief of parliamentary justice & human rights commission ( sic ! ) . 
  1948 ) , son of stalinist judge roman kry\u017ce ( 1907-1983 ) ; pzpr 1970s-1989 , judge during prl , in 1980 convicted opposition activists ( incl . 
  future president komorowski ) for illegal celebration of november 11 ; 2005-07 high official in pis ' ministry of justice . 
  of course , such people are minority , but fact that they are accepted there tells a lot . 
   thats the week of crazyness . 
  it 's actually a year for us :(, 
   to give you some background you forgot significant trivia : before 1989 he performed hundreds of abortions , without any protest . 
  it might be more visible here , and in one case ( hungary ) it came earlier . 
  but that 's definitely part of broader , global shift . 
  hopefully , temporary one . 
  kind of 1968 \u00e0 rebours . 
   ask you if you think that is there any shift in ee , or if it is n't like that for while . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean here . 
  what is the question ? 
  yeah , because democracy in western countries works great . 
  it 's global problem , not only ce/ee . 
  catholic clergy cuddling with our present government . 
   antoni dydycz - some random , low-importance bishop . 
  and emeritus since 2014 ( photo was done while he was still `` reigning '' in his see ) . 
  although he 's still one of most `` beloved '' among pis base . 
  extremely backwardish . 
  could be `` has no potato '' . 
   poland is not that cheap . 
  houses ( or rent ) are n't , but most of things you can buy in shops , especially groceries , are . 
  at least compared to bordering countries . 
  yeah , i know . 
  and those ( vinegar crisps ) are truly awful , tbh . 
  it 's part of british heritage , so ... it mean more than it should . 
   it was a proposal from an ngo . 
  which pis voted further into commission procedure . 
  and meanwhile , has n't do the same to another ngo proposal , liberal one .
