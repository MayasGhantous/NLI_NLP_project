  and yesterday kaczy\u0144ski clearly vocalized support for more strict law . 
  what relocation ? 
  how can we call something a failure , if it did n't even happen ? 
  * spirytusowy 10 % * , of course . 
   far from it , when he left , his party was the clear leader in the polls . 
  not clear , pis was contesting already . 
  but we can agree , that he would probably get better result ( which could mean no individual majority for pis ) . 
  his fault here was that he tried to force kopacz into his successor , which lead to lack of unity in party during crucial year . 
  imho situation would be different , if po elected new leader already in 2014 . 
  no matter who would it be , he/she 'd have more internal support . 
  unless you were a jew . 
   send army in  remove their patches  claim its local reconquista  profit hey , it 's already copyrighted by russia . 
   obviously the airbus pr department . 
  if airbus lied about the offer , polish government could easily debunk it , showing the real documents . 
   it was n't as good for poland . 
  it was best for our military . 
  single contract fulfilling various needs , like transport ( both regular , vip and special forces ) , sar , asw ... list goes on . 
  and if what airbus is telling is true , it would be better for our military industry as well . 
  airbus ' offer was the single one , which fulfilled conditions . 
  not because contest was written with caracal in mind ( which is a lie our pro-pis media are telling ) , but because competition offered smaller helis , in this case s-70i instead of s-92 , and aw149 instead of aw101 . 
  tl ; dr airbus won , because their offer was the only serious one . 
  boris approves this message . 
  they are in alphabetic order from the north . 
   this polish government is really bad imo . 
  yup . 
   might not be a smart move as poland is strongly dependent to the eu subsidies the problem is not even about money . 
  with possible trump 's victory and brits leaving , europe might be left alone against russia . 
  and guess who has strongest military in eu then ? 
  french do . 
  although i agree with trump in one thing - we ( both europe and poland ) ca n't rely on usa alone with our security . 
  which means : further integration , including united eu military . 
  of course still allied with usa , but on more equal level . 
  not really stronghold , but as it 's a major city ( \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) , and pis is weak ( er ) ( than po & . n combined ) in ** most ** of them ( maybe except lublin and bia\u0142ystok ) , it could be true . 
  still , i think it is more about ** giving ** contract to their ( pis ' ) `` stronghold '' . 
  oh look , it 's bunker people . 
   first time i 've ever heard black hawks being inferior . 
  inferior in role needed by polish army . 
  it was transport/multipurpose helicopter deal , not attack one . 
  plus bh proposal did n't include weapons . 
  french one did . 
   article says that they want black hawks that can be made locally . 
  black hawks are definitely not inferior in my opinion because they are proven to be one of the best helicopters out there caracal was intended to replace mi-8 ( transport helicopter ) and mi-14 ( sar/asw helicopter ) . 
  s-70 is a mediocre in first one , and none in second . 
   jobs for locals if they are made locally . 
  caracal deal included offset with local jobs . 
  but those would be new ones , not in companies where pis ' buddies from unions are strong ... 
   bring a warm jacket and good weatherproof ** boots ** . 
  if you have something like [ these ] ( https://outletowo.pl/pol_pl_szare-adidasy-191438_5.jpg ) or even worse , you 'll be really miserable . 
   if the ping to gaming servers was n't so high , it 'd probably be paradise . 
  i suppose shipping fees are a pain in the ass as well . 
   i do n't know what happend to western poland buy i am sure it is terrible . 
  barren wasteland , infested by weird [ screw-robot-things ] ( https://d-nm.ppstatic.pl/k/r/0e/d5/4eb921b04b88b_o.jpg?1420066800 ) . 
   but i 've never used it to mean the late summer itself . 
  i heard it used that way , but it 's probably archaic . 
   snowing in poland ? 
  it 's mountains area . 
  no snow here ( and i 'm just on the other side across the sea from ) . 
  although tbh , it got cold quickly , i was walking in a t-shirt just few days ago . 
  did n't work for saudia . 
   and he is not the representative of polish population . 
  opinions are changing quickly . 
  like father , like son . 
   then again i do n't know how that part of poland is in terms of ideology and conservativeness , then again he did get elected so maybe it 's not that conservative ) . 
  it 's kind of in the middle , neither really conservative or progressive , although sld ( post-communist party , biedro\u0144 was a minor politician there ~ 10 years ago ) was quite strong there . 
  he won , because has shown an alternative to `` old '' and compromised previous mayor , responsible for high debt and stagnation in the city - so bar was really low here . 
  and he has actually used his publicity ( being a gay candidate ) in a smart way - when journalists came or invited him to talk about it , he quickly moved onto s\u0142upsk problems and his program . 
  i 'm surprised he 's still alive . 
  read about him in the 1990s . 
  what a revenant . 
   i have not hope that next government will be better . 
  everything would be better than pis . 
  ok , maybe except onr - but they stand no chance , luckily . 
   po - compromised autocrats they are finished anyway , at least in present state . 
  i anticipate partition , or even fragmentation . 
   i do n't see any hope for me here . 
  i hope for new centre-left party , without commies ( sld ) . 
  probably in coalition with nowoczesna . 
  there are three years until elections . 
  a lot can change in the meantime . 
   if this never gets passed . 
  the opposition wont really be able to use this as ammo before the next elections . 
  pis will lose some support anyway , which can be impossible to recover . 
   maybe , but the louder and more radical the protests get , the easier it is for the government to back away from it . 
  which will result in backlash among supporters of strict law . 
  they might be a minority among population , but among pis mps ... ? 
   most people are against any changes to the old compromise . 
  also , many people are mad because it ** does n't work ** anyway . 
  chazan 's case is a good example , and a tip of iceberg as well . 
   you ca n't win against religious fanatics . 
  you can win people against them . 
  let 's hope that exactly is starting here now . 
  scaremongering works . 
   now pis is doing middle eastern ( christianity is middle eastern ) social policy . 
  actually proposed law could land us ** behind ** many me countries , e.g. 
  iran ( albeit it 's hard to compare - in islam , abortion on grounds of danger to woman 's health or life is an obvious choice , as woman 's life is clearly said to be more important than embryo/fetus ; on the other hand , abortion after rape is much more rarely allowed ) . 
  and not passing could react in secession of some mps , just like in 2007 . 
  indeed , kaczy\u0144ski has tough choice here . 
  not that i pity him  i suppose pis will try to `` soften '' proposed law a little , and call it a new `` compromise '' - but that wo n't appease any side . 
  it 's too late , stone started moving . 
  let 's hope for avalanche in three years .
