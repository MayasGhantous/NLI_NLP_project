  suppose i should respond with `` this ... is ... '' , but tbh it 's not funny at all . 
  albeit i have small beam of hope , it would be the bump which will start pis ' road to fall . 
  forget constitutional tribunal , this could make people ** care ** . 
  it 's millions of genocides every morning . 
   what 's next : ban on in vitro and limitation of prenatal testing . 
  no , it 's not a joke . 
   you can still abort it if mother 's life is in danger . 
  ** direct ** danger . 
  now put yourself in place of medician who has to decide , how serious danger is at the moment . 
  knowing that on one hand he risks patient 's life , on other landing himself in jail . 
  pretty much as you said . 
   few days ago , poll results got released and around 14 % of polish women favor more restrictive abortion laws ( including total ban ) , 20 % want more liberal laws ( including abortion on demand ) and rest are that they should stay as it is or undecided . 
  11 % in favour of strict law , 37 % in favour of liberal law , 47 % for status quo . 
  opinions changed a lot since before summer break , when indeed status quo support was around 70 % . 
   they should push beyond stopping the current measures . 
  no chance during present parliament . 
  but actually some people think ( me included ) , that if more strict law is passed now , it 'd be more easy to introduce new civilized one ( in next parliament ) , than it would be without any changes . 
  present `` compromise '' law was kind of untouchable . 
  it still is . 
  downvoting you , it seems :(, 
  and poles being car thieves . 
  and `` polish plumber '' . 
  ^ ( ( there is also xenophoby , homophoby , and backwards catholicism , but unfortunately there is some truth in all of those ... thankfully mostly just in words ) ^ ), 
  actually land of blooming onion , 
  i have no idea how frequent it is , but here is mother theresa 's indian [ passport ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/dwjegh/passport-of-mother-teresa-exhibited-in-his-mothers-house-in-kolkata-dwjegh.jpg ) . 
  female officers at airport security are frequently present anyway , e.g. 
  for personal search purposes . 
  it 's fake , here 's [ unedited photo ] ( http://nn.by/img/w1500d4/photos/z_2015_08/burqa-qbfr8.jpg ) . 
  even in afghanistan women have to show their faces in passports , although on national ids they can opt for finger print instead ( as can be seen here in two cases ) . 
  does this ban include catholic nun veils ? 
  it might change . 
  look at spain 30-40 years ago and now . 
   what country ya from ? 
  * da same , dawg * . 
   btw , how `` with fire and sword '' movie has been accepted in poland ? 
  quite well . 
  hoffman ( director ) changed it a little , e.g. 
  to show khmelnytsky in better light ( he was much more negatively described by sienkiewicz ) , of course stupka 's performance helped here . 
  and polish ( wi\u015bniowiecki 's ) atrocities were at least briefly shown . 
   a sympathetic character in the story sympathetic ? 
  it seems we watched two different movies . 
  in the west younger generation is usually less religious . 
   it 's poland who will have the strictest law in europe , if not in the world . 
  maltese law makes it de facto illegal under any circumstances , thankfully de facto it seems to be not excecuted in case of health & life risk . 
  and of course it 's entirely illegal in vatican . 
  it 's also severely restricted in andorra ( roughly like law proposed in poland now ) . 
  total ban is also in force in some latin american countries ( chile , dominicana , salvador ) . 
  it 's performed only in immediate risk of woman 's life , and still criminal investigation applies then . 
  they have total ban . 
  nah , pretty much everybody just made it up with you being a lost cause . 
  i had phimosis incision ( it 's not circumcision , just a cut when foreskin is too tight ) being 3 or 4 years old , and do n't remember it at all . 
   it puzzles me why americans and non-jews do it . 
  it prevents masturbation ( or rather makes it less easy to do ) . 
  tbh , it might be good in ** long term ** . 
  because present `` compromise '' law is/was untouchable ( it was passed ~ 20 years ago , after long and brutal debate , and no party wanted to touch it later ) . 
  if it will be exchanged , even for a more harsh one , it would be much easier to pass new liberal law under new ( non-pis ) government . 
  tl ; dr taking one step back now might make taking more steps forward in future much easier . 
  in general , ( imho unfortunately ) overwhelming majority ( 60-70 % ) of poles support present , `` compromise '' law . 
  about 30 % support exacerbation , less than 20 % relaxation . 
  what 's especially suprising , is that harsh stance has biggest support among youngest group ( 18-24 ) . 
  because they consider an embryo a living human . 
   kaczynski voted for `` ratuj kobiety '' which was for more liberal abortion law . 
  he did n't vote to pass it , just to allow it reach next phase ( debate in parliamentary commission ) . 
   sad news . 
  but you need to remember that is not pis legislature . 
  it 's project presented by people . 
  but if it will be passed , pis would be responsible . 
  latter one . 
   for instance , in 2010 , when orban had a large enough parliamentary majority to change the hungarian constitution , he passed limitations on freedom of speech , public and private media , and changed the electoral law to favor large parties such as fidesz . 
  we do n't really know , what would pis change , if they ** had ** constitutional majority . 
  crach is geralt 's friend . 
  boning your friend 's daughter = awkward . 
  but otherwise - indeed , she is . 
  that there will not be another witcher game ** soon ** . 
  more precisely , definitely not earlier than in six years ( they have plans written up to 2021 ) . 
  somewhere else they confirmed no such game is planned , although `` they 'd love to '' return to witcher lore sometime . 
   she 's not undergone the mutations , however she could be considered a witcher . 
  exactly - no mutations , but she received a witcher training in swordmanship and theoretical knowledge . 
  she had big magic potential as well , which she lost ( in the books ) , but somehow could get back in future games ( yeah , it would be non-canon , but lots of gameplay already was ) - then she would be a witcher minus potions , but plus spells . 
  and of course , powers from tw3 ( blink etc. 
  many fans hope she will be in fourth game ( which could be made after cp ? 
  it depends . 
  there are both multinational corporations , and national ones . 
  ubisoft is so international , that it 's hard to place it in single country ( possibly canada , but not entirely - btw , canada is definitely a big power in vg industry ) , while fromsoftware is entirely japanese . 
  cdpr is polish in ownership and employees , but second one could change - there were already many non-poles working under w3 ( but probably still minority ) , and surely more will join with cp . 
   and books too i suppose moomins are kinda well known . 
   they have 100 million to 1 billion people ready to fight for them not really . 
  saudis are n't liked in the muslim world , and even hated in some parts ( iran ) . 
  meh , i would just convert . 
  heard that ottomans drunk wine anyway , and pork is overrated . 
   cultural problems , rather than religious one . 
  of course , although religion belongs to culture . 
   but we have problems with `` us ( akp supporters ) / them ( everyone else ) '' mentality especially under this government 's rule and atheists fall into `` them '' cathegory . 
  kind of the same here in poland :(, 
  i suppose spiderman would agree here . 
   but it does n't make sense !, 
  lots of things does n't make sense , and still people believe in it . 
  i only said that 's a real thing . 
  that 's not my opinion . 
   in noko kiminism is religioun in everything but name .
