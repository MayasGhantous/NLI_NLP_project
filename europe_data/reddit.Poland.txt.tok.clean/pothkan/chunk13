  although it 's communism mashed with traditional civilization ( confucianism here ) . 
  in general , communism has tend to evolve into various national / local mutations - even in ece ( differences between poland , czechoslovakia , ddr ... ) , not even talking about such cases like * democratic * kampuchea . 
  exactly . 
  and when you remember that stalin was attending to seminary schools in youth ( and got good grades , until he dropped ) , one wonder how much it had influenced him . 
  or better , [ zlad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnyg-xu-7sq ) ? 
  still , her success was mostly in ussr . 
  she was recognized in poland , but nowhere at level of e.g. 
  she was very popular in 1990s ( and came high in eurovision ) , but i doubt if she 'd win overall . 
  i 'd pick [ maryla rodowicz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maryla_rodowicz ) instead , even if i do n't really like her . 
   well yes , it was an ideology . 
  nope , it was more than that . 
  socialdemocracy is ideology . 
  liberalism , conservatism are . 
  but you do n't see socialdemocrats or liberals eradicating ( literally ) people believing in other ideologies . 
  ah , the famous * millet * system . 
   aw , the podhala\u0144ski looks like a golden retriever . 
  it 's a lighting . 
  adult ones are white-white , not golden-white like here . 
  popular and liked race . 
  is n't that the same e.g. 
  with czechs and pilsner urquell ? 
   for example , i do n't know a single person who 's religious . 
  not one . 
  so everyone i know is a part of 24 % ? 
  did you ask anyone you know about their stance on religion ? 
  most people do n't brag about it even here in ece , i suppose in scandinavia it 's even less . 
   edit : i 'm jealous of you pepiki . 
  czechs had specific religious history . 
  first hussite reformation , next imposed catholicism ( by habsburgs ) , then quite secularist czechoslovakia ( 1918-38 ) . 
  i doubt if poland can reach such numbers ever . 
  still , i 'm sure atheism will grow here , i see portuguese numbers in ~ 10 years , and spanish in ~ 20 . 
  you know , communism was kind of religion too . 
  there were succeeding prophets ( marx , lenin ... ) , there was a promise of paradise ( mundane one ) , there was strong aversion to different opinions ( heresies ) ... 
   i am an atheist and in my id card it writes `` islam '' . 
  all the people i know is the same . 
  are open atheists persecuted in turkey , like e.g. 
  it happens in indonesia ? 
  i 'm talking just about aggression , not the result . 
  and yeah , they got beaten , but actually kind of won . 
  of course it was a pyrrhic victory . 
  finland lost lots of land and was forced to accept soviet naval base , but fortunately preserved internal independence . 
  you should n't , chocolate is poisonous to dogs . 
   oreos have been making an appearance in force in finland this year . 
  they appeared here in poland last year . 
  honestly , i do n't see what 's the deal - it 's fine , but nothing spectacular . 
  on the other hand , oreo ice cream is quite good ( although overpriced ) . 
  year later ? 
  they invaded finland in ** two months ** . 
   ofcourse the first thing you do is buying time . 
  by agreement with your `` enemy '' to divide neighboring independent country ? 
   poland took a part of czechoslovakia it was n't an invasion , but agreed annexation . 
  of course , czechs had no real choice there ... they were already screwed by `` western powers '' in munich . 
  still , it was an awful act we should be ashamed of . 
  but it 's nowhere comparable to 17.9.1939 . 
  and 6 . 
  polish pow officers were murdered . 
  why ? 
  i do n't see millions of europeans surrendering to salafi way of way just because they are walking in the streets . 
  they are a minority even among european muslims , which are a minority themselves . 
  how many such women there are in germany ? 
  few hundred at best . 
  few thousands in whole eu ( even including uk ) . 
  it 's a red herring . 
   enabling isolation of these groups it would happen anyway . 
  shops are n't the reason . 
   i do n't want to live in a europe where this shit is normalized so what , should we ban nuns next ? 
  some of them isolate themselves , and do n't participate in society productive way . 
  any real terrorist or criminal danger should be persecuted - that 's obvious . 
  but if our civilization is based on freedom , we ca n't chicane people only because we do n't like their way of life ( as long as it 's not literally harmful ) . 
   if you cover yourself up head to toe you 're sure to have a massive shortage . 
  on the other hand , you have less risk of sun-related skin diseases , including cancer . 
  so there 's pros and cons . 
  of course , wearing a niqab is an extreme way - but same could be said about addiction to tanning beds . 
  most of all : if we would want to ban every potentially unhealthy thing or custom ... list would be veeeery long . 
  where was it ? 
  do these shops force anybody to wear their clothing ? 
  no , contrary - they want to be paid for this . 
  so they 're responding to ** demand ** . 
  if we want to get rid of islamists , we have to fight reasons of this demand - not supply . 
  and if we ban such shops , what would it help ? 
  there would be online shops in other countries , there would be ebay , and least but not least - i suppose such clothing could be made diy way . 
  also , should n't we prefer muslim business which is paying taxes here , than ( muslim ) people on social welfare ? 
  they found a market niche , good for them . 
   '' '' `` islamist feminism '' '' '' - say what now ? 
  some western feminists refuse to wear bras , use make up , prefer to wear pants etc. 
  - just to avoid `` woman as a beauty object '' attitude . 
  there are islamist feminists who veil heavily for the same reasons - to not be judged by their beauty ( or lack of it ) . 
  of course , it does n't mean all of those women do it for these reasons . 
  yeah , it worked marvels in france . 
   as , of course , is tradition in poland . 
  it is ? 
  o_o i carry a knife only when hunting for mushrooms . 
  and then we fall under the moron right-populist government . 
  oh , wait , no . 
  this time we have to blame ourselves :(, 
  you said that some look like top picture here . 
   they seriously wrote that ? 
  they did n't - it 's what pm of uk said two years ago . 
  article lists different , often contradictory ideas , proposed by different european leaders . 
  and this one ends last in the poll .
