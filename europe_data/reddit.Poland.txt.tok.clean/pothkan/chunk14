  where ? 
  no / s , i 'm curious . 
  so ... just like poland ? 
   ca n't be helped since the internet lets ~ ~ you ~ ~ know just how rich those countries are  ** us ** not you , fellow compatriot  on the other hand , it 's easy to get knowledge how bad it 's somewhere else . 
  unless you do n't want to . 
  i was comparing romanian 2000s to polish 1980s . 
  when we were in deep hole ( still , romania was in even deeper one then ) . 
  like famous joke : `` what was in romania before ceausescu ? 
  - electricity '' . 
   in short , countries that were poor will still be poor nope . 
  they will be just ** less rich ** . 
  latin america is poor . 
  most of asia is poor . 
  middle east is poor . 
  africa is even below poor . 
  compared to most of the world , eastern europe is quite rich . 
  our problem is that we prefer to compare ourselves with western europe , which is the richest . 
  because we are constantly comparing ourselves to west - germany , uk etc. 
  that 's why we consider ourselves still poor , and are n't keen to accept what we achieved . 
  we want their to be on their level , ** now ** . 
  because we love our heroes , martyrs and monuments - not statesmen or entrepreneurs . 
  because we do n't like and do n't trust each other , so we do n't consider any success as collective one ( unless it 's sports ) . 
  because we love to say we belong to west , and in the same time are n't sure about that . 
  there are more reasons , most of them irrational . 
  hard to describe it in simple terms . 
  already know & seen it ( on streetview of course ) . 
  true , we are known for that . 
  [ thanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_prussia ) !, 
  sure . 
  but i compared it to polish bad . 
  good for you slovenia . 
  i hope he 's packing silver bullets . 
  you know , for all these vampyres during night . 
   she also happens to be one of our most competent politicians . 
  is there a thing about belgian politicians do n't giving a ** about their appearance ? 
  because you know , there is also one guy with disgusting teeth and awful hair . 
  but nevertheless , he seems to be competent . 
  maybe you could ride on shepherd dogs ? 
  wow , 2009 looks worse than poland ** before ** 1989 . 
  good for you . 
  nice that you are finally catching up . 
  why am i dv-ed ? 
  greek sounds weird . 
  nice , but weird . 
   has already pacified the last radical right winged party it was n't really radical , rather reactionary . 
  yeah , m\u0142odzie\u017c wszechpolska ( one of founding groups ) was nationalist , and some young nationalists acted there , but core of lpr was catholic-conservative . 
  it was actually quite similar to post-2010 pis . 
  you are a proof something is very wrong with our nation at now . 
   there is no `` nurturing '' here . 
  from kaczy\u0144ski point of view , onr are at best useful idiots there is , but reason is different - pis would probably like onr to grow a little , so then they could present themselves as a barrier against them , just like fidesz is doing with jobbik . 
  can pastafarian wear a colander ? 
  contrary to popular graphics like above , burka is actually a common byword of niqab , especially in south asia . 
  remove teutonic , 1410 best year . 
   who exacly would take orders from two random eyes ? 
  in [ this case ] ( http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3113/3112724.large.jpg ) i would n't dare to argue back . 
  actually , in a swat squad they would fit in . 
   but things have changed and ruling people have n't ... 
   yes , local agriculture does n't look as good as polish unless it changed in last few years , it does n't look at all . 
  from what i 've seen in oblast ( mamonovo & bagrationovsk to k-grad , k-grad to svetlogorsk , baltiysk & tilsit , ca n't say anything about eastern part ) it was barren , fallow fields everywhere ( and forests of course ) . 
  cross-border contrast was overwhelming , even bigger than on polish-german one ( and remember that warmia-mazury is one of poorest regions of poland ) . 
  i hope it 's better in `` mainland '' russia , do n't know anything serious about there . 
  i have been in sp only , and except of one-day trip to tsarskoye selo , did n't see anything in more rural areas . 
  and sincerely , i 'm not even sure if it 's really a problem of soviet times . 
  agriculture in belarus somehow works quite well . 
  best wishes . 
  let 's hope you 'll get better in following years . 
   but assimilating 3mln people in country with native population of 36-38mln is just a wet dream . 
  it depends on annual intake , and ethnic composition . 
  3mln of e.g. 
  asians in 10 years - disaster probable . 
  but in 30 , 40 ? 
  imho we can safely allow up to 100k of `` exotic '' migrants per year ( of course not from the beginning , starting with ~ 10k and rising quota slowly ) , + additional 100k or even more of `` close '' ones ( like ukrainians ) . 
  vietnamese minority in poland , while 1st generation speaks broken polish and consider themselves vietnamese , 2nd generations very often have polish names ( like jan , anna , bartosz etc. 
  ) , they have no problem with polish language , they consider themselves polish and are considered polish . 
  same happens in most of western countries . 
  first generation of refugees or immigrants is often lost ( to workforce etc. 
   that 's a sizeable minority . 
  noticeable rather , it 's only ~ 50k . 
  they are `` visible '' because of asian looks , but still - it 's not a big community . 
   as for india - there is small immigration of indian people to poland , mainly engineers ( at least in cracow ) . 
  and as indian can be mistaken for middle eastern , i 'm not sure they would feel really welcome here . 
  plus sea cuisine is usually great . 
  i would welcome more vietnamese , thai or indonesian bars here . 
   compared to 2016 ? 
  we are still in 2016 , mate . 
  if you meant compared to 2014 , 2015 - there is literally no difference . 
  foreign food in the markets was replaced by russian mostly ( which i 'm totally fine with ) i might be out of date ( was in k-grad last time 4 or 5 years ago ) , but most of russian-made fresh food ( ham , sausages , cheese , bread even ) in stores was worse , than our/polish one . 
  what 's more strange , it was also more expensive . 
  and when i found one quite tasty sausage , it happened to be ... belarussian . 
  and it does n't seem to be k. oblast problem - had similar experience in sp . 
  let 's be sincere , collectivization destroyed russian agriculture . 
  fixing it will take decades . 
  on the other hand , i was pleasantly surprised by russian beer , and how many brands there were available , some even local . 
  but again , quite expensive . 
  actually only items i found to be cheaper than in poland were tobacco products and fuel ( vodka was roughly the same , although there were some cheap < 100 roubles brands i did n't even dare to try ) . 
  and he looks like he know that :d, 
  meh , it 's probably just a big village in chinese terms . 
  actually it was old ruthenian , but close enough . 
  true . 
  i did n't have any problem speaking just english in germany , lots of people are fluent .
