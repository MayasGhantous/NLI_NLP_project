  while in france ... 
  compare pronunciation of `` neiger '' and `` sne\u017eni '' . 
  we just need a serious program of switching from coal to nuclear . 
  and we need it like , day before yesterday . 
  not really china , they have to import themselves actually . 
  i 'm not sure , but we get our coal mostly from australia ? 
   we are still poor ** bullshit ** . 
  we rank mostly in 30s on hdi and similar rankings . 
  we are richer ( on average ) than most of latin america , middle east and asia ( of course except japan & rok ) , not even talking about africa . 
  there is no hunger in poland ; no deadly natural disasters ; no epidemics ; no war and high violence . 
  we are just less rich than western europe , which is the ** richest ** bunch of countries in whole world . 
  we made big progress in last 20 years , and it 's the moment to start feeling responsibility . 
   because heating house for 6 months with electricity would be fu * king ridiculous when did you had to heat for 6 months lately ? 
  it 's mostly 4 , 5 at best in last years . 
  there were winters of less than month ( total ) of 24h sub-zero temperatures . 
   my amateur assessment is that the only feasible alternative is a eu program to help poland go nuclear . 
  exactly . 
  only wind is feasible here of other options , and only a little . 
  most of poles hate miners ' unions already . 
  unfortunately , these unions are part of pis voters ' base . 
   they should be pushed hard to radically step up their renewable energy program . 
  we should ... but not now . 
  present government would easily use it to blame eu more . 
  long-term anything plans are n't our thing in general :(, 
  still , coal power stations are n't really a major problem . 
  individual people heating their houses on their own are , especially if it is n't even coal they are using ( just trash ) . 
  they were either stupid not knowing how bad it is , or already knew they would have to break this promise . 
   furthermore , we got no oil , no gas actually , we have some gas ( in pomerania and baltic shelf ) . 
  enough to sustain basic people 's needs ( ovens , heating - unless winter is really long and stark ) , not enough for industry . 
  not even talking about using it for power stations . 
  but yeah , we really need atom to replace coal . 
   as i mentioned coal mining is big industry so laying off thousand at the same time would be disastrous like in uk and would create areas of poverty . 
  not really . 
  yeah , it would sting , but upper silesia already started to move into post-coal area . 
  number of people working in coal mining dropped ** under 100k ** recently . 
  imho the problem is blown out of proportions , mostly by big working unions . 
   finally , what is maybe the most hurtful fact for me personally is that awareness of climate change among polish elites is null . 
  it does n't exist . 
  it 's a little like being positive about refugees . 
  even if you believe it 's right , it would be a political suicide to admit it openly . 
   both solar and wind power are really meh . 
  solar wo n't work here , indeed . 
  but wind ? 
  sure , it wo n't be enough to replace coal , but it 's already happening . 
  check middle pomerania - i traveled recently between koszalin and s\u0142upsk . 
  wind farms ** everywhere ** . 
  interesting fact : there 's a polish slang word for knife - `` majcher '' . 
  obvious similarity to greek here . 
   with the amount of bulgarians i see in the us in these developer positions i would have expected to see them higher . 
  you know , they are already in us . 
  there is theory that uralic , mongolic and turkic languages share common origin . 
  they have many similar features , like agglutination . 
   honestly it 's more like polish there are some slight differences in grammar , and more serious in phonology ( some `` rounded '' vowels ) . 
  but most important , there 's no really a single standard of silesian ( contrary to kashubian ) , so when people speak it , it 's often less or more mixed with polish . 
   neighbouring languages can have things in common and influence each other even if they 're not genetically related . 
  if i 'm using the terminology correctly , they 're called areal features . 
  romanian is good example . 
  romance language with lots of slavic influence , especially in vocabulary . 
  plus azeris have an adittional vowel ( inverted e ) . 
   hieroglyphic writing consistently omitted the vowels just like modern semitic languages ( at least with short vowels , e.g. 
  arabic \u0648 can be either w , or long u ) . 
   lol . 
  just to spite the poles huh ? 
  to be sincere , czech ortography is more efficient . 
  we ( poles ) stick to ours because of tradition and ages of written texts , but lithuanian is a relatively modern written language ( literature was rather scarse before 19th century , except bible etc. 
  ) , so they could start anew . 
   you 're mistaken . 
  your `` d\u017e '' would be polish `` d\u017c '' . 
  in polish `` d\u017c '' is different than `` drz '' ( while '' \u017c '' = `` rz '' , except rare cases like * zamarzni\u0119ty * ) . 
  however , lithuanian `` d\u017e '' seems to be similar to our `` d\u017c '' , indeed . 
   artificial non-convertible currency with a ridiculous rate any more . 
  actually there was . 
  [ inflation ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/inflacja_w_polsce ) peaked to nearly ** 600 % ** exactly in 1990 . 
  it stabilized quickly in next years , but still - 1990 is a very bad year to measure anything in poland . 
   conveniently ignoring the fact that they , themselves , are immigrants . 
  by the way , it 's nothing new . 
  european immigrants in late 19th century usa ( new york etc. 
  ) , including also poles , tended to be more racist ( against black people ) than anglo-saxon americans . 
   i do n't understand the reasons . 
  heterogenous population . 
  nearly 100 % are white and polish , and small minorities ( germans , ukrainians , belarusians ) are close enough to be not really distinguishable . 
   polish people do not only hate foreigners , but also each other . 
  true that . 
  although i would n't say it 's exactly hate . 
  we are `` just '' extremely ** distrustful ** . 
  of other people , state , anybody , anything . 
  also , there is a polish saying : * moja chata z kraja * - it means directly `` my home ( is ) aside '' , but more precisely it 's just `` not my problem '' . 
  this attitude is overwhelming here . 
   and from chechenia ( or in short , just the christian refugees , not evil muslims ) actually pis home minister is blocking chechnian refugees from crossing the border , at the moment . 
   we have a lot immigrants , especially from ukraine . 
  exactly : ** immigrants ** , not refugees . 
  while pis was `` defending '' that we have hundreds of thousands ukrainian refugees . 
  we have hundreds of them only , at best . 
   if there were no muslims in europe then there would be no terrorist attacks . 
  were muslims . 
   the polish govt has pretty much convinced the people unfortunately it 's not as simple as that . 
  xenophobia among poles is sadly `` natural '' , from the bottom up . 
  pis government is only fueling and following it . 
  true that . 
  it 's a big f *** ng hipocrysy , when we do n't want to accept any refugees or immigrants , while blaming brits for not wanting to accept poles .
