  not really . 
  economy in poland 1988-1990 was deep shit , it was actually falling down for a few years before ( while in 1950-70s it rised , of course much more slowly than west ) . 
  we started to rise from it quite quickly , but only since 1991/92 . 
  it was similar in romania . 
  hungary and czechoslovakia fared better , because their communists already started some reforms ( guly\u00e1skommunizmus & stabilizace ) . 
   to be fair , most generals up to this day often prepare for the last war . 
  that 's the joke - germans exactly went around in last war . 
  different time . 
  however , it was a shame . 
  french-polish-czechoslovakian alliance , before munich , could stop nazis . 
  unfortunately , neither czechs , neither us willed it in 1930s . 
  plus memel snackbar . 
  nothing like that happened , at least not in 1938-39 . 
  they are kremlin 's unwitting , * useful idiots * . 
  just like fn , brexiters , fidesz , or pis . 
   why is the afd bigger in the former ddr than in the rest of germany ? 
  same reason why there is high islamophobia in other ece countries . 
  on one hand , lack of muslims = no first-hand knowledge , only media bias . 
   `` we send a message to brussels , so they understand it too '' yeah , like anybody understands hungarian . 
  harlow is 93 % white . 
  which is pretty high number for an english town . 
   there is no indication of who they were at all , other than they were `` from harlow '' . 
  that does not indicate anything in our multicultural society . 
  harlow demographics is 92.5 % white . 
   just one question how many poles were members of the communist party it peaked at ~ 3m in late 1970s ( which meant ~ 10-12 % of adult population ) . 
  these are numbers comparable to nsdap , but lower than sed ( which included ~ 15-16 % ) . 
  by the way , fun fact : guess which parliamentary party has highest number of ex-commies in their ranks now ( i mean mps ) . 
  yeah , it 's pis . 
   the austrian social democratic party cosying up to turkish communities . 
  why there is an arabic writing ? 
  turks use latin alphabet since ~ 80 years . 
   where it is apparent that romanians and roma are two different groups , they say they do n't want romanians . 
  because they still mistake one for other , even if both are listed . 
  romanians are not liked in polish polls as well , although we have no real reasons for that ( next to none ethnic romanians come here anyway ) . 
  there is only one explanation - roma , gypsy , romanian - people do n't care . 
  remove ketchup , embrace sriracha . 
  although maybe not on pizza . 
   so your point of view is that football fans are unreliable extremists ? 
  yeah , pretty much , at least in eastern & ce europe . 
  why did he use english words ? 
   that 's honestly a shame . 
  what exactly ? 
  sorry , but i edited post in the meantime . 
  i meant muslim women in europe . 
  check this [ report ] ( https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/a-unveiling-the-truth-20100510_0.pdf ) ( it 's about niqab , but probably answers concerning hijab would be similar ) for example , especially pages 49 to 54 . 
  parents ' reaction to the decision to wear the veil : positive 12-16 % , negative 37-62 % . 
  husbands ' reaction : positive 46 % , negative 31 % . 
  it proves that while some women are coerced into wearing the veil , other are doing it on their own will , even ** against ** their family . 
  there is no simple image . 
   and their mothers did n't wear the veils because they were n't exactly living under sharia law not too long ago . 
  there is another reason : veil was in ** decline ** few decades ago ( generally from 1950s until 1970s ) . 
  look at egypt for example - 1920s ? 
  veiled . 
  unveiled . 
  veiled again . 
  change happened because of wave of modern islamism ( started roughly in early 1970s ) , and later globalisation of islam . 
   to someone who 's born into a lifestyle . 
  only that in europe it 's sometimes ( often ? ), 
  a choice . 
  there are muslim women who veil although their mothers did n't , and there are of course converts as well . 
   positive examples wont work with this many muslim women in europe do n't even wear a headscarf . 
  problem is that some muslim women do it willingly , on their own , sometimes even against wishes of their family . 
  do christian nuns wear a veil because they are told to ? 
  that 's why should prosecute men telling women what to wear ( when it happens ) , not banning women themselves from wearing this or that . 
  people have different beliefs , we should tolerate them ( as long as they are not doing harm to others ) . 
   is to help foster and grow exactly . 
  through positive examples , not bans . 
  there 's no difference . 
  what one wears ( or not wears ) should be nobody 's business except this person . 
   but how do i make sure that the right people get my money . 
  even if you could , nothing change until majority of customers do the same . 
  according to 2011 census , only 2.5 % of albanians are atheists , plus 14 % `` undeclared '' . 
  i meant `` our '' = polish . 
   so are you saying a woman is n't fit to do the duty and requires a man to escort her ? 
  no , i mean that if there is a need for personal search , policeman could do it on a male suspect , and policewoman on female . 
  which is n't even religion-related : i suppose native scottish woman would still prefer to be searched by another woman . 
   useful idiots thinking they 're fighting fascism . 
  read the story , she mentions skin cancer patients who probably learned about burkini only because of news about french ban . 
   the one that answered your generalization ? 
  the `` plenty '' ? 
  not backed up by some research ? 
  there was your * they * before my * plenty * . 
   when i said that a specific/some cases do n't determine how things should be in general . 
  but you did n't give a proof that these cases are indeed specific ( = that majority of women wearing these garments do it against their will - i remind , we are going back to your [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zc7ip/algerian_businessman_pays_burkini_womens_fines/d6uqtdw ) ) . 
   let 's instead a chair to cushion , a fluffy bunny tranquility stars flabbergasted inane road back forward . 
  you are really enjoying these games , do n't you ? 
  i will better live you in privacy , do n't want to disturb ... anything you plan to do later . 
  and you seem to like having last word , anyway . 
  so ... bye !, 
  and it was a joke . 
   even in ultra theocratic iran the vast majority of women wear just the hijab . 
  now . 
  until the early 20th century , many iranian women actually veiled their faces . 
  from iran , it spread into afghanistan and india ( in shape of burqa ) . 
  same happened in ottoman turkey and areas held by them . 
  of course it was mostly cultural , while modern iran uses religious reasons , and their shia interpretation says niqab is not necessary . 
  historic research suggests , that faceveil first appeared somewhere in the middle east , already in ancient times - maybe persia ( strabo mentions it in his * geography * ) , maybe arabia , maybe mesopotamia . 
  it was used for some time ( 4th-3rd century bc ) by greek women , in hellenistic period - it might be custom copied from some eastern culture during conquers of alexander . 
   ( i would argue even this , in bahrain it is n't that common ) niqab seems to be worn by minority of women in most of muslim countries ( although of course it 's bigger percentage than among european muslim women ) , except yemen and saudi arabia , where it could be a majority ( not counting areas where it 's imposed by non-state groups , i mean isis and taleban ) . 
   i still did n't get an explanation why i have to back up my claim that some specific cases do n't determine general approach .
