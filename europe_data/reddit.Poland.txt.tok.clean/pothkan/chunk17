  because i did n't ask about it , only about ** generalization ** you used earlier ( quoted two or three posts above ) . 
  only after that question ( never answered ) you backed into `` some '' , and then we sunk into quarrel about semantics . 
   there 's this thing called `` an axiom '' . 
  and you used any ? 
  where ? 
   i do n't see how it 's a mockery . 
  i pointed that only adjustment we have to make is not minding , and you answered we have to mind too much enough . 
  when i asked what exactly , you said - hummus . 
  which you had on a sandwich . 
  which seems you just like it anyway . 
  unless some bearded sharia police member forced you ? 
  i 'm really sorry i have to explain all this to you . 
  do n't take it personally . 
   obviously someone could reach for it , and you ca n't just throw it off if it slows you down or gets loose . 
  i suppose policewoman would be rather running ** after ** , not from somebody . 
   yes , and i guess you could run wearing a hijab if it 's well tied . 
  [ i guess so ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9xnl6w8qouy/un72uxsaiti/aaaaaaaaa1e/k3hbbr3qtsk/s1600/palestine-run.jpg ) . 
  i knew it was a different word ... still , it seems you got what i meant . 
   you did n't , instead you tried to disprove mine . 
  i think i said quite clearly that i do n't like this ban , because one 's clothing ( in public area ) is nobody 's business except this person oneself . 
  also , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zc7ip/algerian_businessman_pays_burkini_womens_fines/d6uq73m ) . 
   i did n't leave any of your points unanswered . 
  i asked you two questions . 
  one ( about some/plenty , research etc. ), 
  you circumnavigated while backing up , although i agree we might have gone too deep about semantics and misunderstood each other . 
  second one , you simply mocked ( with hummus ) . 
   where is it supposed to lead to ? 
  clearly nowhere . 
  and ira their skimasks ? 
  oh wait , then they would actually blend in swat team . 
   can you run wearing a hijab ? 
  can you run wearing a cap ? 
   but what if they have to arrest a male suspect ? 
  are they okay with conducting a body search ? 
  i suppose they would just do mixed patrols ( man + woman ) . 
  hijab is religious , it has quite strong base in quran ( and by the way , kind of in bible as well - paul wrote to corinthians about women needing to `` cover their heads '' ) . 
  concept of veiling appeared in all three ~ ~ jerusalem ~ ~ abrahamic religions . 
  niqab on the other hand , seems to be traditional , probably even pre-islamic . 
  it has some backing in * hadiths * , but it 's up to interpretation , muslim scholars differ here ( between `` it 's obligatory '' and `` it 's cultural and has nothing to do with islam '' ) . 
   ... and yet you found some to bring up in the last post . 
  sorry , i misread that there are still some unadressed . 
  at least we 're clear here . 
   you 're using specific cases as an argument . 
  again , * et tu quoque * :  you assume they are allowed to express their opinions and are free to make a choice . 
  there was such rumor : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-german-citizenship-application-embassy-queue-claims-complete-rubbish-rejected-latest-a7194161.html it might be a bullshit , but on the other hand his wife is german , so he might be entitled to it ? 
   you said that we have `` plenty '' of examples of women being comfortable with wearing tents . 
  which means exactly . 
  plenty of ** examples ** , not majority/minority in the group . 
  it just proves that at least some of them want it . 
  i suppose you could find plenty of contrary examples . 
  we could even exchange them . 
  still , it would prove nothing , except that both cases are happening . 
  if we had , let 's say 100 women , and 20 voices for `` i want it '' and 10 voices for `` i don ' want it , he/they forced me '' , we still would n't know opinion of remaining 70 . 
  unfortunately , biggest research i 've found was based only on [ 32 women ] ( https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/a-unveiling-the-truth-20100510_0.pdf ) ( again , i 'm talking about niqab here ) , which still is interesting ( says a lot about who they are and why they wear it ) , but might be not representative for whole group . 
  while you used `` some '' in meaning of `` minority among given group '' , as an argument that minority is not enough to allow them ( to wear it ) . 
  and it was a backing on your side anyway , because in previous post you seemed to be suggesting that they are all forced . 
   the ones you addressed when i told you to do so . 
  i found no questions not addressed . 
  anyway , it seems there 's no point - we clearly wo n't convince ourselves . 
  wait , so if farage receives german citizenship , he will have to relinquish british one ? 
  oh boy , it would be hillarious . 
  oh sorry , i was n't sure what are you talking about exactly . 
  i might read a quote as part of your comment . 
   nazi germany is not the only example . 
  at first they cut beards of orthodox jews ... later , it was n't that innocuous . 
   i ca n't answer if i 'm unsure about what i 'm being asked abut . 
  this does n't make you right . 
  ok , i clarify :  just because some among their women think it 's reasonable to wear a tent on a beach does n't make it reasonable for all of their women to be forced to wear it . 
  do you have any data how much is `` some '' here ? 
  is it majority ? 
  minority ? 
  your statement ( `` some '' ) suggests it 's minority - can you back it up ? 
   it 's just that by becoming a merchant one should n't fancy himself a liberator . 
  and yet , that 's what she does . 
  obviously , that 's part of marketing . 
  many brands are viewing themselves as being positive about something . 
  but it does n't cancel the point - that burkini is a compromise clothing , mix of muslim and western features . 
  her business success proves that there was a market for it . 
  and by the way `` muslim fashion '' business is a big thing , which actually helped many women to gain more personal independence . 
  same with nekkaz - let 's be sincere , he 's using this cause for sake of personal popularity , probably in hope of political attempts ( or just feeling good about himself ) . 
  which also does n't cancel that he has a point here . 
   either you 're addressing my points , or it ends here . 
  which points i did n't address ? 
  no / s here . 
   where i prove your arguments to be either wrong or irrelevant examples ? 
  i mean wrong , because what is or is n't irrelevant is rather subjective . 
   but i 'd like you to confirm that what you 're saying is an universal thing of course it is n't . 
  my point is that ** should ** be . 
  and concerning mosque : this is a place of faith , with special ** dress code ** . 
  as i know christian churches and jewish synagogues have it as well . 
  while beach ( or street , park etc. ), 
  is an universal , public place . 
   not just some idea only yuropeans should adhere to . 
  how can we view ourselves as a pinnacle of freedom , if we make clothing bans ? 
  it 's plain hypocrisy . 
   no need to do it in public , you can pm me with said photos . 
  unfortunately , i ca n't . 
  not only because i also wore what is expected of me ( which in case of mosque meant simply taking shoes off , because i wear swimming trunks only to beach/pool anyway ) , but mostly because i do n't like taking photos with myself , so do n't have many of them . 
  but never mind , off topic . 
   recent `` burkini only '' water park event in france created a lot of outrage because organizers officially stated that women who wear bikinis willfully risk getting raped as opposed to those who wear burkinis .
