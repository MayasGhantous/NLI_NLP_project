  so in a way burkinis are an attack on our values , culture and social advancement and gender equality . 
  * in a way * ... burkini is n't a problem . 
  statements like above , areo . 
  nothing good will come out of ** bans ** like that ( niqab ban is stupid the same - there were some rational security reasons , but let 's be sincere - origin was exactly the same , to please right voters ) . 
  what we need , is showing those women that they can unveil if they want to . 
  not ** force ** them . 
   you did n't answer my question . 
  i asked first . 
   we do n't mind many things already . 
  example ? 
   you seem to think that because you 're ok with something , everyone else should . 
  why ? 
  because it 's not my business what somebody else wear or does n't wear . 
  and it should n't be anybody 's business . 
   women in europe spent many years fighting for the rights to be naked and not judged for it . 
  did they ? 
  i though women 's fight , feminism etc. 
  was more about rights to vote , equal payment , basic rights ... 
  i do n't recall women activist fighting for swimsuits . 
  this one rather has to do with fashion ... ? 
  false advertising . 
  you know : * liberte * , * egalite * ... 
  and doormat !, 
   the whole debate is completely fucking ridiculous !, 
  this whole year is completely ridiculous . 
  with strains of real tragedy . 
   forcing women to adhere to a dresscode is oppressive , period . 
  is n't this ban exactly that ? 
   `` do n't piss them off , we 'll only get more bombs ! '', 
  isis is an apocalyptic group . 
  they do n't care about bombs , they want world to burn and end . 
   it 's not about women 's rights . 
  it 's about sending a message . 
  `` we do n't want you here '' ? 
  bullshit , our commies never really dared to enforce atheism ( maybe except few years in early 1950s ) . 
  not that it would work anyway . 
  atheism ca n't be enforced , one has to grow unto it . 
  problem is that burkini is n't actually about `` radical islam '' . 
  it 's kind of solution to compromise muslim idea of female modesty with western way of life ( sports , beach , jogging etc. ) . 
  i suppose burkini would be an outrage in saudi arabia ( not even talking about daesh ) , as it still shows too much ( of shape ) for wahhabi nutjobs . 
   you 're asking me to prove that `` jedna jask\u00f3\u0142ka wiosny nie czyni '' . 
  and * tu quoque * . 
  if we do n't have that we should n't assume most of them are either forced , or not . 
  if there are women who ** want ** to wear a niqab ( in europe ) , i assume that there are women who want to wear burkini as well ( not the same women , of course ) . 
  even if they are a minority , and more of such women are forced to , it still makes this ban a chicane against personal freedom . 
  and concerning women forced to : instead of ban on burkini , we should let them know they do n't need it , and should prosecute men forcing them if disclosed . 
   actually , it was invented because she wanted to earn some money . 
  well , duh . 
  and that 's ... bad ? 
  plus , it does n't exclude whether she really made first one for herself . 
   i see absolutely no reason for us to be the side that has to adjust our ways . 
  our adjustment here would be just ** not minding ** . 
  it really is n't an effort . 
  and if we can adjust to obese naked people on beach , i think adjusting to clothed people ( obese or not ) wo n't be so hard . 
   so , unless muslim society finds a way to gain our trust , it 's gon na face more and more of such ludicrous bans . 
  which would make them feel even more second-class . 
  oh yeah , i see how it will work peeeerfectly fine . 
  no doubt . 
   it screams `` hey , yo !, 
  if you ca n't be trusted to behave like adults , then we 're gon na treat you like kids '' . 
  it screams `` get the *** out , we don ' want you here , and if you stay we will make your life as incovenient as possible '' . 
  which i agree , is a bottom line . 
  only it 's ** our ** bottom . 
  yeah , right . 
   it 's a joke to think women are freely choosing to wear this . 
  people do stupid things , period . 
  if we ban burkini etc. , we should also ban breast enlargement , tanning beds , high heeled shoes ... my point is that we of course should not , either of that ( although tanning beds may be we should , at least for non-adults ) . 
  it 's one of women he paid fine for . 
  [ his wife ] ( http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2011/07/110722_belgica_francia_multa_velo_pago.shtml ) does n't even wear a scarf ( and basing on name , is n't even a muslim ) . 
   because that 's how it is . 
  do you have any research data to back this statement ? 
   however , rather than embrace the idea and seek some agreement did you even read the linked article ? 
  it tells about origin of burkini also . 
  which was invented by an [ australian muslim woman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aheda_zanetti ) , who wanted to go to beach , swim etc. 
  ( which is very australian thing to do ) , while preserving her religious identity . 
  if we 'd really want to socialize and integrate european muslims , we should be open to such compromises . 
  ban on burkini ( or any other muslim garment ) seems to be a proof , that we do n't really want any of that - we just want them ** gone ** ( at least from our eyes ) . 
  these bans are n't for their good - but for ** our ** complacency . 
  would n't that make him even more french in soul ? 
   you assume they are allowed to express their opinions and are free to make a choice . 
  if somebody says she/he does something because he/she ** wants ** to , i should n't assume she/he is surely * forced * or * brainwashed * ( by somebody else ) just because ** i ** think this thing is stupid . 
  and there is plenty of interviews or docus with women wearing such clothing while voicing their will to do it , for whatever reasons . 
   it does n't have to be a law , often the women would be grouped , called a whore and some times raped . 
  true , but it does n't happen only in muslim countries . 
  india , mexico , central africa ... women have it bad everywhere . 
   if it was a law that all mothers have to have their babies vaccinated , would that be a bad thing ? 
  of course not . 
  but first , lack of vaccination can be a serious harm to health ( according to prevailing research ) , not only of given baby - but of whole population . 
  second , child ca n't decide on its own . 
  by the way , law on clothing on children or teens ( e.g. 
  ban of hijab in schools ) would be ok as well - if you want to wear it , you have to be ** adult ** first . 
   in most islamic countries , you can not go outside without a hijab or burqa without getting into trouble . 
  first , not really . 
  only iran and saudi arabia ( plus some minor areas , like aceh in indonesia ) have laws imposing a hijab on women . 
  and burqa/niqab is imposed nowhere except isis & taleban . 
  second , there is no difference between law dictating a hijab , and law banning it . 
  both are a ** restriction ** , both are against personal freedom . 
   but male 's right to dictate what women are supposed to wear and where . 
  same could be said about ** men ** ( mostly ) introducing these bans . 
  if there are any cases of men forcing women to wear such clothing in europe - of course , ** they ** should be prosecuted .
