  but if it 's woman herself wants to do it ( i 'm sure both cases happen ) - let her . 
  it does n't matter what are her reasons , as long as she do it on her will . 
  if we truly believe in freedom , ** both ** should be allowed . 
  it 's nobody business ( especially state ) , who one wears or not wears . 
   this man is getting praise . 
  i do n't give a damn about man himself . 
  but he has a ** point ** . 
   his duty is to stay out of european affairs just an addendum : he 's actually more french than algerian - relinquished citizenship in order to start in algerian elections ( which did n't work , as he did n't even gained basic votes to register * - he counted on algerians living in france , but in algeria he 's seen as `` not true '' - does n't even speak arabic or berber fluently ) . 
  ( * he said he did , but those disappeared - hard to tell who was right , as algeria is n't really a 100 % democratic country ) . 
  crucial quote :  `` my duty is to remind great european democracies that what made these great democracies is the respect of fundamental freedoms , '' nekkaz said . 
  `` freedoms that have been taken away from women who have opted to wear the traditional islamic dress . '', 
  said nekkaz , who is married to a woman who does n't wear the traditional islamic cover . 
  despite his philanthropic gesture , nekkaz said he believes wearing the niqab or the burkini is not the best way to integrate in european societies . 
  `` however , like the french philosopher voltaire once said , even if i do n't agree with these women , i will fight until death to guarantee their freedom of expression , '' said nekkaz . 
  i do n't care about this man ( heard that after success in business he tries in politics , which does n't really worked ) , but got to admit - he ** has a point ** here . 
  wait , so does estonia is our mini-japan ? 
  he 's nearly surely a russian estonian ( ethnic russian , estonian citizen ) . 
  misguiding flair :p anyway , it 's * we are the cure * speech from ** iron sky ** movie . 
  weird , we are both in eu . 
  [ by the way ] ( https://youtu.be/zuc5ej7jcp4?t=144 ) . 
   honor killing doesnt exist in albania it still does , although it seems only among males now ( no longer women , hopefully ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing#albania and honor killings against women is still a big problem in india - among ** hindus ** : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing#india, 
   90 % of the women will not go against them for fear of death . 
  care to give source for that number ? 
  and which women , exactly , where ? 
   there could be a hotline for women to call the police that would give them instant protection and possibly a new identity . 
  i agree . 
  but again , what does it to do with burkini ? 
  you 're just changing a topic . 
   is it so hard to accept 99.9 % of those killings are done by muslims ? 
  as one of countries with highest rate of honor killings is india , i strongly doubt this number . 
  care to give a source ? 
   do n't act dumb , how many christian tribes are there ? 
  in europe : itt was common among albanians , both muslim and christian . 
  still happens against males . 
  outside middle east ( which indeed , is most notorious for that awful custom ) , it 's happening ( still ) in india , among ** hindus ** . 
  [ recent example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manoj%e2%80%93babli_honour_killing_case ) . 
  and was happening in latin america ( husbands judged not guilty when murdering their wives because of adultery - which can be considered similar to honor killing ) . 
  anyway - why are we punishing women ( for wearing this or that clothing ) ? 
  should n't we punish men forcing them to do so , ** when ** it actually happens ? 
  `` honor killing '' does n't come from islam . 
  it 's tribal custom , just like fgm . 
  it 's indeed a big problem , which should be strongly prosecuted - but what it has to do with burkini ? 
  what punishment ? 
  how are muslim women not wearing burkini etc. 
  in europe punished ? 
   islam is not , leaving islam can be punished by death in countries with sharia , even if it 's rare , it 's still there . 
  still , most of muslim women in europe do n't even wear a headscarf . 
  so they can too , if they want . 
  niqab , hijab , burkini etc. 
  might be forced upon in middle east , but here it 's mostly voluntary . 
  there is plenty of those women saying they want to wear it - while we do n't hear many complaining about being forced to ( again , i 'm talking about europe ) . 
   hmm ... okay , well , that 's confusing . 
  so what do they want to curb then ? 
  i 'm talking about vocabulary . 
  in common language ( english and most european ones ) burqa / niqab are just bywords . 
  and `` afghani '' burqa is n't really worn in europe , mostly because it 's just not convenient - actually it 's being replaced by niqab even there and in pakistan : http://www.dawn.com/news/1102048 ( although as you can notice , both garments are actually called burqa , while niqab means faceveil itself ) . 
  so yeah , names can be confusing . 
  but on the other hand , it 's nothing rare - compare meaning of `` pants '' in us and uk . 
   gon na repost this article about the difference between burka and niqab because i made the mistake myself in an earlier thread from some days ago . 
  it 's not entirely correct . 
  word `` burqa '' is used in muslim countries , depending on country it can mean niqab , black dress , or even just hijab . 
  in general , it 's byword of niqab . 
  garment commonly known in english as [ burqa ] ( http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2010/04/30/1225860/801122-burqa.jpg ) , worn only in afghanistan , pakistan and ( rather in past than today ) india , is known as burqa in pakistan , but in afghanistan it 's actually called * chadari * . 
  of course . 
  still , it 's appearing in some dictionaries . 
  why ? 
  i know russian , and with native polish can quite easily understand ukrainian , at least in written form ( spoken - much less ) . 
  belarusian - even more . 
  btw , there is a similar ( slightly outdated ) polish word * wychodek * . 
  [ relevant cartoon ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ydmspuk52vu/uqgpbrbgpri/aaaaaaaabje/r894fuykm3w/s1600/47.png ) . 
  every pole was a baby . 
  ok , i was wrong with age . 
  still , it happened roughly in parallel . 
   rz = \u017c rz is sometimes spelled r-z , but ** very ** rarely ( e.g. 
  also , ch and h were actually considered different sounds even few decades ago , they `` unified '' rather lately ( h was voiced , like in bo ** h ** dan , very similar to ukrainian \u0433 ) . 
   why the hell people are still using ( ... ) is anyone 's guess . 
  tradition , history . 
   you 'd be wrong , but non-poles have a hard time distinguishing the sounds . 
  to be sincere , in sloppy spelling pole would have a problem too , if there was no context . 
  there , easy peasy , got anything else ? 
  :d two mistakes . 
  first , `` y '' vowel in polish is different from `` e '' . 
  second , you correctly changed one `` rz '' in grzegorz to \u017e , but other one not . 
  and third , `` en '' and '' \u0119 '' are slightly different as well , but it 's a minor thing ( in `` en '' tongue touches the palate , in '' \u0119 '' not ) . 
  because \u041b\u043e\u0434\u0437\u044c is russian historical name , from period when you have occupied us for over hundred years . 
   ba\u0142agan this one was actually borrowed from yiddish !, 
   so you get jabko . 
  actually japko - remember , devoicing , 
   is there an implied vowel in `` jab\u0142ko '' ? 
  kind of , you can try to speak it with a very short `` u '' in place of '' \u0142 '' . 
  but it 's commonly spelled just `` japko '' ( '' \u0142 '' is skipped , `` b '' devoiced ) . 
   when i was a little kid i also almost never bothered to spell out `` jab\u0142ko '' ( apple ) correctly  i 'm sure most of use just spell it `` japko '' anyway . 
   cause almost physical pain to say out loud . 
  my favourite polish word is * \u017ad\u017ab\u0142o * , 
   it 's those damn cz , sz clusters meh . 
  czech one is worse : * str\u010d prst skrz krk * . 
  it gets easier however , when you just remember to put a short ( polish ) `` y '' before all those `` r '' - s. . . 
  but having such surname would be a pain ( imagine all those signatures or logins ... ) . 
  polish common name - `` pelotka '' .
