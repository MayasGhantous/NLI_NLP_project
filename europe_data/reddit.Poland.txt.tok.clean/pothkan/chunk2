  what action ? 
  steady ... we need to call a preliminary meeting first . 
  and then determine when actual one will happen . 
  interesting fact according to video : while majority of people were generally negative to woman , it was less with older/estonian people , and more with younger/russian . 
  ergo , minority seems to be less tolerant than native majority . 
   even just one conflict could unravel any compromises . 
  or it could be just a pretext to deny them . 
   does not always work that way . 
  but it happens quite often , and of course is an ideal situation . 
   which is the case with islam . 
  examples ? 
   this cultural conflict ca n't be solved before the conflict has been solved separately conflict ca n't be solved only if one make it a conflict in first place . 
   both require math , including game theory . 
  they do not . 
  i mean game theory , because of course some math is sometimes necessary . 
  in demographic history . 
  but thankfully cliometry was already demoted to just an auxiliary discipline . 
   one ca n't measure nor assess without numbers . 
  but does one need to ? 
  how do you measure culture ? 
  is it even necessary ? 
   social sciences is game theory 101 . 
  not always . 
  still , i prefer anthropological & historical approach . 
   that is just badly applied math . 
  correct math would not be based on gdp alone . 
  or we could just stop fetishizing numbers . 
   politics needs more applied math seriously ? 
  applied math would dehumanize politics even more . 
  hey , we are already messed up by gdp cult . 
  and applied math in cultural policies ? 
  big no . 
  it should stay where its place is - in science ( s ) . 
  so pareto is just a zero-sum thing . 
  sorry , but i do n't agree . 
  if we apply game theory to intercultural or international affairs , it would end very badly . 
  it 's society , not mathematics . 
  also , how pareto applies in this case ? 
  it 's not about giving or taking anything , it 's about individual personal space ( precisely , clothing ) or freedom of ( weird ) expression . 
  i do n't see how pareto = harm . 
   tells that cultural liberalism is actually about genociding existing cultures . 
  i disagree . 
  imho our purpose is to ** overcome ** gray areas between different cultures . 
  example , when some custom ( let 's call it n ) is banned or obligatory in one culture ( let 's call it x ) , and permitted ( or just not concerning ) in other one ( y ) , common law for x+y should just make n permitted , while followers of x would be free to not do/do n. because banned/obligatory < permitted . 
  so - as long as two different sets are covering themselves in at least small area , there is a good possibility of ** common ** denominator . 
  problem is starting only when sets are mutually exclusive , e.g. 
  when n is banned for y , but obligatory for x. 
  then if any of stances is breaking the harm principle ( e.g. 
  n = fgm ) , other one should be chosen . 
  however , if there is no such violation , some ** compromise ** is still possible . 
  for example , let 's say that n is a military service , obligatory for x being a majority , but banned among y minority ( e.g. 
  then y should get an individual exception from service , compensated by e.g. 
  some different , probably longer peaceful alternative service , or special taxes . 
   one should not apply `` no harm '' principle only on the level of individuals . 
  of course , it should oblige any authorities as well . 
  thereso individual harm principle should be expanded , with help of good old cathegorical imperative of our baltic fellow kant , into common law . 
   not of some obscure principle `` some obscure principle '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  ** [ harm principle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harm_principle ) ** is one of fundaments of cultural liberalism . 
  nice song . 
  estonian is overall nice , albeit weirdly sounding ( and entirely non understandable ) . 
  i like that one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dajybq5_lg, 
  good luck in your baltic fortress . 
   spreading violent monoteist foreign culture would run counter to the constitution . 
  first , there is a thing called ** freedom of belief ** ( including non-belief btw ) . 
  second , this gal is n't * spreading * anything . 
  she just covers her face . 
  with a piece of cloth . 
   but spreading islam is like spreading nazism oh look , it 's godwin 's law !, 
  great , just great . 
   always better than the majority discrimination . 
  what discrimination ? 
   yeah , sure . 
  and stalin was georgian and soviet russia liberated independent georgia of its freedom in 1921 . 
  and what 's that got to do with issue discussed here ... ? 
   the precautionary principle sets the burden of proof on the face veil wearers . 
  women mentioned in article says it 's her choice . 
  is n't that proof enough ? 
   because the majority of the citizenry would decide so . 
  you just described minority discrimination . 
   anything is possible . 
  migration is part of the survival game of life she 's latvian , her husband is latvian ... what migration ? 
   she opted to do so on her own and converted his husband to islam . 
  does n't look like peer pressure to me . 
  husband might disagree . 
  who knows , she could force him to ** grow a beard ** . 
  or do this thing which is done to jew & muslim males . 
  so you 're reasoning that if ordinary people are uninformed ( intentional euphemism ) , we just should adjust to them ? 
  that 's not the progress , it 's opposite . 
   you are less likely to socialize and help person who 's face you do n't see . 
  but may be that 's the point ? 
  that they just do n't want to socialize . 
  can we force them to ? 
  in this case niqab could be considered just an extension of personal space . 
  on the other hand , for some ( it 's what i assume based on few watched docus & read papers , all few years ago for an anthropology essay purpose ) it 's contrary - wearing niqab they feel secure & confident , and therefeore are more eager to socialize ( which of course does n't mean partying etc. , but e.g. 
  working with different people ) . 
  tl ; dr many women under these clothes are probably their own , different persons . 
   go google pictures of veiled women and tell me if they are happy , sad , scared or surprised . 
  if eyes are showing , it 's actually quite easy .
