  simple as that . 
   is that a thing ? 
  not really . 
  it has common etymology with our `` szuka\u0107 '' , only meaning got vulgar with time . 
  notice , that etymology czech actual word for `` search '' , * hledat * , can still be noticed in polish * przegl\u0105da\u0107 * ( browse ) , * rozgl\u0105da\u0107 * ( look around ) . 
   i was once told that polish is basically a vulgar czech since a lot of our `` normal '' words are apperentely terrible swearwords in czech  it works both ways . 
  not really a swearword , but czech word for `` departures '' - * odchody * - means `` feces '' in polish . 
   i just do n't understand why polish did n't adopt the czech/lithuanian system tradition . 
  our ortography was invented in 15-16th century . 
  why should we switch to different , younger one ? 
   i.e. , ` ch ' and ` sz ' from german , ci/si from italian these are used for entirely different sounds in polish . 
   this is a specific beach . 
  hardly universal . 
  there are already calls for all-france ban . 
  and niqab is already banned universally there . 
   theres only so long someone can be a recluse . 
  are you sure ? 
  we live in times when one can even make groceries online . 
   state decided what we wear or not anyway . 
  you ca n't teach children in underpants only can you ? 
  this is a specific job . 
  i 'm talking about universal laws . 
   if people are not being allowed to go outside , you do n't make concessions to the oppressors . 
  but what to do if they oppress themselves ? 
  many of these women in europe wear such clothing on their own choice , not because somebody ( i mean other person , not religion itself ) forces them to do so . 
  if we do n't allow them to wear what they want , it 's more probable they will just go into reclusion . 
  state should n't decide what one can or can not wear . 
  ( poland ) . 
  it seems to be ok now , but there are worries - pis government is quickly increasing expenses , while not giving serious equivalent in income - they even want to retreat retirement age reform ( from 67 back to 60/65 ) , although fallout for this decision was already taken by previous government . 
  and let 's be sincere - presented social ideas ( which again , might be not a bad idea - e.g. 
  500 + should boost consumption ; healthcare reform actually looks good too ... or rather better than present mess ) mean taxes have to go up . 
  but it would be unpopular , so ... 
  i suspect gravely deficit in next years :(,

   burqinis are one of the things , that a certain group of people is forcing another group of people to wear . 
  burkini was invented by muslim woman ( it 's actually a trademarked brand ) , so she could involve in sport in public while not showing her body . 
  so on one hand yeah , it 's because of their weird religion . 
  on the other , it 's allowing these women to ** socialize more ** . 
  and be more healthy , btw . 
  compare it to dismantling of * purdah * concept among indian muslims ( about 70-80 years ago ) . 
  some of these women never wore a veil . 
  why ? 
  because they were n't allowed to go outside , and stayed imprisoned at house . 
  so when some of them started to going outside , although fully veiled ( think afghani burqa ) , it meant more ** freedom ** for them . 
   why ? 
  i just do n't see what benefits banning something like this has . 
  complacency of politicians behind it , feeding of voters demanding it , diverting attention from more serious , but less `` hot '' issues . 
  of course these are benefits from politicians ' pov . 
  and of course , the problem that french immigrant politics is based on ** assimilation ** , contrary to more popular ( e.g. 
  uk , germany , scandinavia , and of course usa & canada ) ** multicultural ** concept , which is more willing to acommodate different cultures . 
  actually it would be interesting if those women switch to neoprene ( surfing ) suits . 
  similar case happened after niqab ban , when some started to wear anti-flu masks . 
   the woman on the right only has a choice when that choice is a burqa not really , at least not in europe . 
  some of these women actually wear such clothing contrary to their more assimilated parent wishes ( it could be compared to youth rebel ) , to ** show ** their religious identity . 
  there are numerous interviews with those women , look up in web or on yt ( good long one [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hhhad_nzu ) , made by french sociologist ) . 
  it 's weird choice indeed , but if it 's theirs , who are we to judge ? 
  on the other hand , women in saudi arabia or iran are rebelling ** against ** it . 
  there is an analogy here . 
   are becoming physical manifestation of values same could be said about nun outfits . 
  so what , ban them too ? 
   on the other hand , i absolutely understand the motivation behind it . 
  conservative islam makes me deeply uncomfortable that 's the problem . 
  french are banning burkini ( and previously niqab , although there was at least some security concern ) only because they do n't feel comfortable ** seeing ** it . 
  on one hand , this lie is indeed awful , and should be fought ( although i do n't think this way is best ) . 
  on the other , let 's be sincere : it was mostly invented for internal political purposes . 
  so pis could say `` look dear voters , we 're defending good name of our nation !, 
  then it should be pretty much named german + every nation under german occupation or allied with germany , with honourable exceptions of denmark , finland and bulgaria . 
  still , truth is simple : ** germans ** started it . 
  other nations sometimes joined , less or more willingly , but holocaust would n't happened without nazi germany . 
  there is a biiiig difference between pogroms ( which indeed happened , although only in one certain region , mostly thanks to `` power vacuum '' ) and death camps . 
   i find such law not the brightest idea , spawned by insecured nationalism , more than anything else it 's mostly directed to boost internal support anyway . 
  `` look dear voters , we are actively defending good name of polish nation '' . 
  it was a ** concentration ** or ** labour ** camp , not death one . 
  there is a ** difference ** . 
  * [ death camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extermination_camp ) : set up by nazi germany to kill jews * en masse * ( gas chambers ) , nearly 100 % people send there died ; also copied ( less efficiently ) by ustasha croatia . 
  * concentration camps : set up by many regimes , including nazi germany , to persecute , and slowly exterminate people through forced labour , often under very hard conditions ; many people died , but you could ** survive ** ( death rate was ~ 50 % for non-jewish , e.g. 
  polish prisoners in nazi camps , ~ 90 % for jews ) . 
  * labour camps : like concentration , but more care was made to preserve prisoners alive ( sometimes barely ) , so death rates were lower , ~ 10-20 % ; these include communist camps , especially soviet gulag . 
  examples of `` pure '' death camps : treblinka , be\u0142\u017cec . 
  there were also ** combined ** concentration & death camps ( divided into different sections ) , including auschwitz and majdanek . 
   pathological behaviour lures to imitation . 
  of course . 
  that 's why we have this awful wave of copycat spree killers , intertwined with real islamist terrorists ( although sometimes it 's both ) . 
   there could be thousands terrorists and their supporters . 
  so current methods and legal frame are insufficient . 
  there is a thin line , where we start to lose more ( of freedom ) , than gain ( safety ) . 
  we have to be careful to not cross it . 
  europe was built on freedom , if we throw it away , we 'll lose . 
  on the other hand , i agree that we need better security forces ( something exactly like ** fbi ** , only all-eu ) . 
  because if those start to be considered not working well ( which seems to be a thing e.g. 
  in belgium ) , crowd will start to act . 
  and that would end very nasty . 
  recent incident in corse might be a warning . 
   each attack rises probability of another attack because it inspires and excites all potential attackers . 
  but it is smaller part of the current danger . 
  to make terrorist ( or spread killing ) attacks impossible , we would have to impose security comparable to police state , like north korea . 
  notice , that even european communist countries were n't safe from such attacks ( heard about hepnarova ? 
  if flair is correct , you should ) . 
  of course , some security measures are needed ( imho present state is already too strong ) . 
  but we ca n't trade our freedom for promise of ( uncertain ) safety .
