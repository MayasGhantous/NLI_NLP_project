  sad truth is that we have to ** learn to live ** with that danger . 
  we must keep calm and carry on . 
  a little off topic : [ cover photo ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-936731-galleryv9-ogxx-936731.jpg ) - `` muslim women wearing burqas in wiesbaden , germany '' . 
  what it really is ? 
  [ an art exhibition ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/burqa-exhibit-naneci-yurdagul_n_2197973.html ) . 
  ** four ** years ago . 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  where are we going to end ? 
  on one hand , you can never be sure about putin 's russia . 
  on the other , there is * some * concern about this paramilitaries to be used in case of present government losing support , e.g. 
  against massive demonstrations and possible reluctance of police to oppose them . 
  yeah , it sounds crazy , but ... you can never be sure about pis . 
  but what 's most worrying , is that some far-right movements ( e.g. 
  neo-fascist onr ) could join these forces and get armed . 
   there 's been a lot of instances where men/criminals have used burkas to hide and travel unnoticed . 
  yeah , in countries where it 's common . 
  in europe such garment would only raise suspicions , not allow criminal to blend in or escape . 
   one religion ( and it 's deluded useful-idiot european liberal fans ) wants special treatment regardless of the law . 
  sikh turbans ? 
  christian nun garments ? 
   there simply is * no acceptable reason to allowing people to hide their faces in this age of terror scares . 
  like suicide terrorists even care about being recognized . 
  they plan to die anyway . 
  burqa is a synonyme for niqab in arabic . 
  afghanistani burqa is actually called * chadari * in afghanistan ( although * burqa * is used for similar garment in pakistan ) . 
  exactly . 
  there is a reason why most of suicide terrorists come from france and belgium . 
  assimilation policy failed . 
  ** in ** the middle east . 
  niqab might be useful for terrorists , if it 's already a common garment . 
  but in europe ? 
  it would only alarm police or security . 
  terrorist need to ** blend in ** to be successful . 
  niqab might be also an useful tool to conceal identity when doing a crime , e.g. 
  during robbery . 
  but suicide terrorist does n't care about being recognized , he 's going to die anyway . 
   you are literally destroying probably the best economy of eastern europe . 
  economy is rather safe . 
  what pis is destroying , are public finances . 
   data is from 2014 . 
  nope , it 's present one . 
  outlook was never `` negative '' under po . 
   proposes tax this proves they are truly french at heart . 
   he also claimed his family had no contact with his brother for three years despite living only a mile from the flat where he prepared the attacks . 
  when his family discovered older brother went to syria and joined isis , it was father who let police know about it . 
  he did it with reluctance , only to protect ** younger ** one . 
   you should check out the story of the mitford sisters in the uk . 
  another example : kurski brothers here in poland . 
  one ( jacek ) is fervent supporter of kaczy\u0144ski , now director of state television tvp , criticized for primitive pro-government propaganda ( although lately he is in danger of being exchanged ... because some people in pis think he is ... too soft ) , and generally a very sleazy guy . 
  other ( jaros\u0142aw ) is deputy editor-in-chief of * gazeta wyborcza * , major anti-government daily newspaper ( and largest one , excluding tabloids ) . 
  this number is weirdly low . 
  according to different polls in recent two-three years , it should be between 65 and 72 % . 
  their maps were excellent . 
  but as i said , today it 's different . 
   muslim women use to be able to wear skirts and swimsuits . 
  back then islam did n't mean women covered up head to toe , and institutionalized rejection of the western lifestyle . 
  you 're wrong . 
  veiling and covering was embedded in the islam since the beginning ( it was probably inherited from pre-muslim arabs and persians ) . 
  muslim women in middle east 100 years ago and before veiled like now , sometimes even more heavily . 
  indeed , there was a wave of secularization ( starting roughly from 1930s ) , when `` skirts and swimsuits '' appeared , but it was reversed in 1970-80s with a wave of `` islamic renewal '' , and was concerning major urban areas mostly anyway . 
  few examples : [ bosnia 1930s ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-yugoslavian-islamic-woman-in-niqab-and-burqa-carrying-basket-in-sarajevo-249572695.jpg ) , [ algeria 1900s ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6f/a5/77/6fa57748390a904b66281742c677f9be.jpg ) , [ central asia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/sart_woman_wearing_a_paranja,_samarkand.jpg ) , [ ottoman macedonia ] ( http://images-00.delcampe-static.net/img_large/auction/000/094/319/951_001.jpg ) , [ late 19th c. iran ] ( https://muhajabat.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/iranwomen.jpg ) , [ india 1940 ] ( https://www.google.pl/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2f2%2f2e%2fworking_committee.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fpurdah&amp;docid=cjj28e_pgmmqsm&amp;tbnid=0slrusucavelhm%3a&amp;w=458&amp;h=278&amp;hl=pl&amp;safe=images&amp;bih=513&amp;biw=1173&amp;ved=0ahukewivx5kazelnahxcwcwkhvt_b4c4zbazcb4ogzab&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) . 
  on the other hand , during the last few decades veiling spread into areas where it was n't very popular in past ( or at all ) , like malaysia , indonesia or west africa . 
  it 's something like islamic `` globalization '' . 
   and you have to clean them briefly after you leave the water . 
  salt ? 
  because `` tourist '' spies are n't a thing anymore . 
  first , nato is actually quite open about its assets . 
  second , you can get more intel just browsing google maps anyway . 
  or doing `` white intel '' , e.g. 
  by checking on local news . 
  it 's better if they perform sport in burkini , than do n't perform it at all . 
  that 's what our government wants you to believe . 
  scaremongering =  `` vote for us , you 'll be safe '' . 
  `` sieged fortress syndrome '' et caetera . 
  let 's be sincere - russian agents will find a way into poland anyway . 
  this chicane is directed at common people on both sides . 
   exactly the kind of people who were profiting from the small border traffic with kaliningrad . 
  not really . 
  pis lost in most of regions involved in polish-kaliningrad trade - not only tricity ( one of anti-pis `` fortresses '' ) , but also elbl\u0105g , braniewo etc. 
  it might be actually a chicane from pis . 
   leftists on the other hand are great intellectuals who will progress humanity into a new era of happiness . 
  glad you see it . 
  better late than never :p, 
   yeah ... right ... you got this from a `` historian '' suvorov aka rezun ? 
  nope . 
  his theory that stalin planned attack on germany already in 1941 , and barbarossa was a preemptive operation , is bullshit . 
  red army was still not prepared then . 
  but nevertheless , ussr and third reich were meant to collide . 
  just ( few years ) ** later ** . 
  [ by the way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk2bfdn7u_y ) ( polish song from 1990 about romanian revolution , it has just accidentally hopped into my winamp playlist ) . 
  so better pray [ china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amur_acquisition ) does n't think that way . 
   and not only that but we did not partake in any of the atrocities of nazi germany . 
  bulgaria even defended its small jewish population ( pre-1941 borders ) from holocaust . 
  tbp : they stayed for a year , than went away for three years , and eventually returned for fifty . 
  but what about quality of life ? 
   ahahahaha , cheeky . 
  cheeky-breeky !, 
   because the latter was liberated by its partisans it 's not entirely true . 
  or rather , it 's a myth , made by yugoslavia after tito-stalin split in late 1940s . 
  belgrade and most of serbia was liberated mostly by red army .
