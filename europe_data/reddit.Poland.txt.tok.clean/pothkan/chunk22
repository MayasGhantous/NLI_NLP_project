  zagreb was abandoned by croatian fascists ( fleeing from approaching red army ) , so partisans took it without much struggle . 
  same about sarajevo or split . 
   the difference would have been that we may have been another yugoslavia , a bit more independent from the ussr . 
  since 1960s you ** were ** pretty much independent from the ussr . 
  but the same could be said about hoxha 's albania , china during cultural revolution , not even talking about khmer rouge . 
  a joke from 1980s ' poland : `` what was in romania before ceausescu ? 
  - electricity . '', 
   good description of what happened ... 
  if he did n't , stalin would probably eventually attack germany anyway , in few years ( needed to recover / reform red army after purges and pyrrhic victory with finland ) . 
   besides , poland did n't have good relations with the czechs during that time . 
  relations with lithuania were even worse , however it changed very quickly in 1938 , also because of mutual german danger . 
  still , it says a lot who is responsible for damage shown in photos above ( except few in the end , which are from palmyra ) . 
  this has nothing to do with isis , and not much to islam . 
  photos above are from aleppo ( except few in the end - palmyra , damage done by isis ) , which is contested between assad and free syrian army . 
  most of them seems to be done in fsa-held part of the city , so damage was done by assad forces . 
  but it has isis too . 
  most of photos above are from aleppo , with damage done by assad forces - not against isis . 
  last few are from palmyra , which is of course isis ' doing . 
   so syria + iraq together does n't even make up half . 
  it 's data about all immigrant arrivals , not only refugees . 
  if you count only refugees , syria alone would probably make over a half . 
  opposition has less tanks and heavy artillery , and no aircraft . 
  example of damage : [ photomap of aleppo ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/5d58/t9q8q6is5q13pubzg.jpg ) , month ago ( caution , large size ! ) . 
  this situation is pretty much unchanged since beginning of battle ( over four years now , more than siege of sarajevo 1992-96 !, 
  - and 1,5 m people live there , compared to sarajevo 's 400k ) . 
  green - opposition , yellow - kurds , red - goverment , blue - contested/no man 's land . 
  ** red dots ** - destroyed/damaged buildings . 
  it 's very probable that ** it is ** assad forces who did that . 
  they have most of heavy weaponry ( artillery , not even talking about air force ) . 
  opposition-held part of aleppo is much more destroyed than government-held one . 
  of course i 'm not talking about last few photos from palmyra - it 's isis crime . 
  what ? 
  i 'm a pole . 
  bulgaria did n't declare war to soviets and they were still conquered in 1944 . 
  so ... nope . 
  aww , how cute ... 
  they stayed for ** 49 years ** here in poland . 
  exactly . 
  although praga was indeed liberated earlier . 
  of all those cities , only kiev , minsk and belgrade could be called liberated without a serious footnote . 
  * berlin , vienna - part of germany ; * tallinn , riga , vilnius , chisinau - conquered by soviets already during ww2 ; * prague - liberated by ( late ) local uprising ; * budapest , bucharest , bratislava - capitals of third reich allied countries ; * warsaw - already an uninhabited ruines when liberated in january 1945 ( although praga district was honestly liberated in september 1944 ) ;, 
  yup , it was our full retard moment . 
  allying with czechoslovakia ( and france ) against germany in 1937-38 was last moment to stop hitler . 
  instead we ( and hungary ) have stabbed czechs in the back ... promi\u0148te !, 
  ( just in case - contrary to present kremlin propaganda , there was none of polish-german conspiracy then , we `` just '' seized the opportunity to get some clay ), 
   a bigger shock is the sky-high support for fp\u00d6 in the poll . 
  by the way , what about fpo coalition ability ? 
  if they win parliamentary elections , but does n't get individual majority , what is more probable - coalition fpo + somebody else , or coalition `` everybody against fpo '' ? 
  immigration of course should be restricted , it 's going too fast lately . 
  but in the meanwhile we have to contain any collective persecution or discrimination of those muslims who are already here . 
  keep calm and carry on . 
  there is no connections , of course . 
  isis wants to fuel discrimination , alienation and fear , and eventually an open war in europe - between us and `` our '' muslims . 
  so victory of le pen , hofer , pegida and other similar right-wingers would be their victory . 
   more terrorist attacks and a failure of the eu-turkey agreement will also play into the hands of hofer . 
  exactly . 
  let 's hope isis does n't orchestrate a terrorist attack in austria before the elections to help hofer . 
   even buddhists ca n't coexist with muslims , which should give you general idea what 's the problem . 
  indeed [ they ca n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rohingya_people ) . 
  but i 'm not sure if it 's muslims ' fault . 
   fact remains that coexistence with muslims has largely been burden and ill for the host country . 
  on the other hand , this host does n't really help to make them feel equal as citizens . 
  there is some fault on both sides . 
   finding information from internet is very simple and easy finding is . 
  sorting / deciding which sources are trustworthy , and which are n't - not necessarily . 
  [ by the way ] ( https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/slide13.png ) . 
   speaking of majority 35-42 % is a minority . 
  worryingly large one indeed , but still - a ** minority ** . 
  sorry , it 's basic math . 
   perhaps the worsening of the problem correlates with the muslim population in relations to the whole population ? 
  or maybe it 's because france performs assimilating policy , contrary to multi-cultural one ( like uk , sweden or germany ) ? 
  or maybe it 's because french muslims were/are coming from different countries than german or british ? 
  there are many factors involved here . 
   i believe that does not apply to generation without internet and to generation with internet . 
  first , many 50 + people can use internet and do it . 
  second , they had books and press . 
  and i 'm not really sure internet is a better medium , overall . 
  do you suggest collective responsibility ? 
  communist parties in central & eastern europe ( especially pre-1939 ) were heavily `` populated '' by jews . 
  about 25-50 % of cp of poland members were jews , compared to 9 % of jews among population of poland . 
  and these parties had higher support among jews , than in general population . 
  still , even among jews it was a minority . 
  like 15 % of jews voting for communists , and 5 % of non-jews . 
  majority of jews ** did n't ** support communists . 
  still , [ stereotype ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbydokomuna ) was made . 
  i do n't compare two things . 
  i want to point that asking `` is it okay '' is n't the same , as asking `` is it justified '' . 
   or perhaps it has nothing to do with age but rather the knowledge ? 
  you rather get more knowledge with age , than lose it . 
   young people go out their way to validate or support their views by facts other than the ones supported by your media wait , what ? 
  of course it is not . 
  but again , compare it to 64 % . 
  which means that ** majority of european muslims is against terrorism ** . 
  and notice , that french numbers are worst , it 's better in other polled countries . 
   did you notice that he simply posted a low-res gif with random numbers that fit his story ? 
  i 've already heard about this poll few years ago , so did n't suppose it was a fake . 
  still , he used it to support his manipulated thesis . 
  example : abused wife murders her husband . 
  ask yourself a question - is it justified , even a little bit ? 
  and other question - is it okay ?
