  does justification makes it okay ? 
   42 in younger generations , and they are a future . 
  true . 
  but first , it 's an universal problem - see at polish youth , it 's also radicalizing . 
  example : ~ 80 % are against refugees , compared to ~ 55 % among +50 people . 
  second : people tend to change their views with age . 
  so 35 not 42 % , notice that also includes `` rarely justified '' . 
  while `` never justified '' is 64 % . 
  and to be precise , question is about suicide bombing , not killing non-muslims ( of course it 's does n't mean it 's not wrong ) , and not about something being okay , but being ** justified ** . 
  mayonnaise ? 
  sriracha best condiment !, 
  ( mustard works too ), 
   belarus is not as bad as most people would think if we talk about average quality of life ( food , healthcare , low crime , social safety , corruption , etc. ), 
  in comparison to russia and ukraine - it 's definitely better . 
  it might be actually best country ( in this field ) of whole ex-ussr ( of course excluding huey , dewey and louie ... sorry , baltics ) and maybe georgia . 
  sorry , here my knowledge rather ends . 
  try googling some faqs ... and wait , there might be a subreddit . 
  indeed , there is [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pigs/ ) . 
  anybody surprised ? 
   how is is relevant ? 
  user with a croatian flair mentioning `` polish death camps '' . 
  see comment above yours . 
   jasenowac - croatian ( nazi germany allies ) camp created to genocide serbs . 
  also some jews and romanis , if i 'm not wrong . 
   us ambassadors have always been appointed that way . 
  true , although there are also ambassadors-professional diplomats ( called career foreign service officers ) . 
  actually there is probably more of career us ambassadors than sinecure ones . 
  it mostly depends on specific mission - `` calm '' ones are rather given to political appoiintees , critical/important ones to fsos, 
  it 's even more in bad taste , because there were actually [ croatian death camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasenovac_concentration_camp ) . 
  actually pet pigs are quite long-lived . 
  they can easily reach 20 years . 
  if you think about nature , it 's one of nicer regions in poland . 
  lots of lakes and forests . 
  yup . 
  this one is ugly , but not oh-my-eyes-they-bleed-ugly . 
   the left owners lacks of taste ... that 's a big problem here in poland , which most people nobody really care about . 
  it 's not only about architecture , also ( or even more ) about * szyldoza * - ubiquitous presence of advertising signs and banners ( and i do n't mean billboards ) . 
  [ see for yourself ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/92/ab/f3/z15969170q,plac-rodla.jpg ) . 
  it 's changing for better , but very slowly . 
  it 's even worse on russian-polish/lithuanian borders , although of course you have to cross it first . 
  especially fields - barren in kaliningrad oblast , cultivated in pl/lt . 
  and it 's no surprise most of food in grocery shops there is imported ( also from belarus ! ) . 
  at least it was few years ago . 
  pigs themselves have no strong odor . 
  their pee & feces can be a problem here ( that 's why pig pen stinks ) . 
  they can be taught to do it in litter & outside , but it 's more difficult than dogs , more like cats . 
  and of course bigger pig = bigger feces = biger problem . 
  that 's why pet pigs are much smaller than livestock ones . 
  although `` small '' here could still mean more than e.g. 
  average dog , about 30-40 kgs . 
  ( btw , i do n't own a pet pig , although someone i know has it , and i do n't really know a lot about them ), 
  probably . 
  pigs are actually quite intelligent and friendly animals . 
   do you become radical muslim without your parents ? 
  have you even heard about `` youth rebellion '' ? 
  many islamic european terrorists actually grown up in assimilated families . 
  they did n't radicalize at home - but on street , prison ( notice many of them have criminal past ) , internet or underground/illegal mosques . 
   evil triumphs when good men do nothing . 
  or when good men do evil things . 
  so are we going to deport vegetarians too ? 
  yeah , because it 's families ' fault .

  edit : -12 votes ? 
  because i 'm against collective responsibility ? 
  are we really falling that low ? 
  they look like a-team vans . 
  po never crossed the line . 
  never disobeyed ct 's ruling . 
  they tried to bend the constitution , but they never ** broke ** it . 
  period . 
  three years . 
   but we have shit like this article - not the constitutional tribunal affair , but hateful propaganda pieces like this article are making poland look like some backward shithole . 
  yeah , of course . 
  / s pis does nothing wrong , it 's all propaganda of polish traitors and enemies . 
   oh sorry then , but still , fuck us , why do we have to end up living next to russians . 
  never lucky . 
  [ commonwealth ? 
   bestonia  spain , italy hey , even we ( pl ) beat italy here . 
  i 'm really surprised . 
   when you have oil and can ~ ~ flip ~ ~ pay off the eu if you want too . 
  ftfy . 
  poland actually had longer periods of peace than war with turkey . 
  yeah , there were some big wars in 17th century ( including vienna 1683 , which was imho a political mistake - we should act like french and let habsburgs fall ) , but 16th & 18th century - peace . 
  and yeah , a brief war in mid-15th century , which was actually a shame ( we broke a truce ) and disaster ( king died in battle , which led to interregnum , because nobody has seen the body ) . 
  sigismund i and ii had good relations with ottomans ( first one even signed a lifelong truce , which was a rare privilege , ottomans mostly agreed only on 10-year ones ) . 
  later , in 1786 turkey even started war with russia , where russians leaving poland was one of their demands . 
  and in 19th century many poles , , e.g. 
  adam czartoryski , adam mickiewicz or general bem hoped for turkish help against russia ( unfortunately ottomans were no longer a serious power then ) . 
   armenians again , armenians lived under ottomans for centuries . 
  it was modern ( 19th century ) nationalism , what lead to genocide . 
  same about greeks - expulsion ( or actually exchange of population ) happened only in 20th century . 
   hungarians some hungarians allied with ottomans against austrians . 
  who was a worse enemy ? 
   look at the conquest of egypt , syria , ottomans bullshit . 
  ottomans were actually much more tolerant than western europe . 
  orthodox or eastern christians could prosper safely . 
  it was a rise of turkish nationalism what lead to armenian genocide , not islam itself . 
  and look where ( sephardic ) jews went , when they were expelled from spain or italy in 15-16th centuries . 
  terrorist islamism is a modern problem , appearing after ww 1 , and especially visible since 1970s . 
  our government pretty much criticises everybody around lately ( except hungary ) .
