  so it was probably poland . 
  b\u0142aszczak is indeed the most pathetic face of this group . 
  he is n't cynic jerk like most of them ; he is just retarded . 
  because there was a wave of even [ more intensive ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-07/we-terrorism-1970-2015final.png ) terrorism 3-4 decades ago in western europe . 
  where is it now ? 
  look at palestinian * intifadas * - five-six years each . 
  islamism terrorism will run out . 
  i do n't dare to say when - it might be a year or two , it might be a decade . 
  my bet - about a year after crushing isis on ground . 
  unless we radicalize ourselves . 
  then it will change into open war . 
  nevermind , i made myself hungry anyway . 
  british cuisine has bad reputation , but actually their cheese is good . 
  some even great . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's france or italy level , but still - nothing to be ashamed of . 
  polish [ hawaii ] ( http://przepis-na-pizze.com.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/pizza-hawajska.jpg ) ( * hawajska * ) style pizza has pineapple . 
  and cheese , as every pizza . 
  it 's actually very popular . 
  and what 's even worse , served with garlic sauce . 
   ** spray ** about a third of a can of ** cheese ** choose one of two . 
  i will stick to my way : blue cheese ( any kind , although i prefer creamy ones , like gorgonzola or blue stilton ) , crisp bread ( like wasa , but polish matzo works too ) , some green olives or nice ham ( polish of course - ham , not olives ) , and chilled light lager ( wheat beer or even cider if i feel especially fancy ) . 
  or if i just want to stuff myself - homemade [ zapiekanka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zapiekanka#/media/file:zapiekanki.jpg ) . 
  champignons , chopped hardboiled eggs , some sausage or ham , paprika or tomatoes , and lots of swiss-type cheese . 
  all stuffed into white buns & baked for few minutes . 
  problem is that we are trading freedom for safety , all because of temporary danger shown by media to be more serious than it really is ( islamist attacks are spectacular and gory , but is it really our most serious problem now ? 
  i doubt that ) . 
  barbarian . 
  let 's be realistic . 
  nobody is paid here , neither side cares about reddit . 
   he did n't do anything evil and i do n't even want him to be punished . 
  it depends . 
  if you think punishment = jail , than of course , duda does n't deserve that . 
  but being clearly named ** guilty ** and banned from public offices , yeah . 
   i 'm not from pis and i did not vote for them . 
  i never said that . 
   what word should i use may be just `` judges '' ? 
  indeed it is . 
  on two fronts . 
  one with islamist extremists , second with our own , right wing ones . 
  and moderate middle is being crushed more and more ... and yeah , our deflated elites are unfortunately in fault here . 
  pis propaganda suggests , that everybody else is united against them , in an united front . 
  that po , . n , kod , soros , gwyborcza , ct , brussels - it 's all the same , no difference . 
  if you believe in such simplified view , you fell for pis propaganda . 
  such opinions are popular even outside pis - take e.g. 
  while his solutions and attitude to pis is different , he shares their view of world . 
   was n't the whole point of voting for pis to stop po from doing these things ? 
  that 's the point . 
  ct mess was a ** minor ** factor during elections . 
  it did n't really matter ** then ** . 
  pis won for different reasons : 1 . promise of 500 + & return to 60/65 retirement age ; 2 . 
  `` defense '' against muslim refugees . 
  plus let 's be sincere , po totally f ** d up their campaign ( it all started with lazy and deflated komorowski 's one ) . 
  and finally , pis gained majority thanks to even bigger failure of our `` left '' ( [ this guy ] ( http://img.interia.pl/biznes/nimg/o/c/leszek_miller_lider_sld_5657583.jpg ) ... ) . 
  yeah , people were angry at po - but not about ct - only ofe , 67 and `` octopusses '' . 
  and many minor things , like e.g. 
  not protesting against ukrainians commemorating stepan bandera ( you might do n't remember now , but there was a strong inflammation when komorowski said nothing about that during/after his visit in kiev ) . 
  2 out of 5 , to be precise . 
  you fell for government propaganda . 
  `` they '' . 
  because it was ** not ** the same action . 
   was n't the whole point of voting for pis not wanting po to win again ? 
  i do n't think that precise case ( choosing of two `` supernumeral '' judges ) played significant role for voters during the elections . 
  it was minor then . 
  this whole crisis started ( just ) ** after ** the elections . 
  no , that 's crucial difference between them . 
  po tried to `` bend '' constitution ( quite often , not only then ) , but when ct ruled contrary , they folded . 
  while pis just ignores ct , and proceeds with their own `` parallel '' law . 
  tl ; dr pis crossed the line nobody dared before . 
  pis used and fueled anti-muslim scare ( tbh not only them , kukiz '15 did it even more openly ) . 
  i 'm 100 % sure , that they will show present eu procedures concerning our constitutional crisis jointly with images of nice , munich etc. 
  and many people will believe this - scaremongering works . 
  let 's be sincere , average pole do n't give a damn about ct. 
  sad but true . 
  we are screwed until at least 2019 . 
  at best . 
  france , germany , usa , everybody - look at us , it could be you next . 
  vote responsibly . 
   they do that and none from eu politics or worldwide media had seen an issue about that . 
  because world waited until the ct ruling . 
  and ct eventually decided , that two ( not three ) judges were n't chosen lawfully . 
  generally : pis mentality goes rougly like that - `` they [ po ] stole a snackbar , thereso we can rob whole market '' . 
   afaik , gas is needed mostly by heavy industries . 
  exactly . 
  poland `` private '' usage ( heating , kitchen etc. 
  - ~ 35 % of total usage ) could be actually sustained by domestic extraction ( yeah , we have some of own gas fields ) . 
  nope . 
  `` daesh '' is acronym for `` dawlat ash-sham '' , which means `` state of levant/syria '' . 
  full name of isis is islamic state of iraq and sham . 
   but i keep reading everywhere that it 's just the acronym for isis in arabic . 
  i 'm not sure if you know , but most of arabs do n't support isis . 
  dutch . 
   on a side note if the news gets confirmed there will be a huge shitstorm in poland over this . 
  like it could get even worse than now ... 
   but it was islam . 
  the shooter was from sodding iran . 
  and 2/3 of victims were from turkey and kosovo . 
  your point ? 
   summa summarum do n't let us alone with france hey , you still have us . 
  your friendly eastern neighbor . 
  germans and swamp germans , please stop masturbating to your language in public .
