   they are called `` model minority '' for a reason sharing their cuisine with us ? 
  ( it is not a sarcasm ), 
  i was amazed how frequent cersanit bathrooms are in russia . 
  seen them at least in ten different places , not only in kaliningrad , but also sp , and even in pushkino ( not palace itself of course ) . 
  and second to them was ko\u0142o , also polish company . 
  it depends on how such uniforms look . 
  do n't know about yours , but indeed , in poland they were plain awful . 
  however british , japanese or seasian look quite fine . 
  le ** gender ** s. 
  [ already ahead of you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggbhfxpqbgi ) . 
  probably uses powerful mana shield . 
  does it include eastern germans ? 
  same could be said about his victims . 
   your written english is really good , but it does have a polish ` accent ' to it . 
  not that that 's a bad thing . 
  kind of cool actually . 
  we tend to leak our syntax into english . 
  slavic double negation ( like `` you never do n't know '' , a common mistake ) . 
  islamists , not muslims . 
  plus some people being just mad . 
  polish billionaire ? 
  nobody heard about him here . 
  and it 's only a statement . 
  ca n't wait until francis tells something in person at wyd , and how our * regime * tries to wiggle out of it . 
  yup . 
  is there any explanation , or just random finnish weirdness ? 
   pilsudski saving his native wilno is kinda bullshit imo . 
  he was still trying to get commonwealth going at that time . 
  \u017deligowski tried to capture as much as he could , possibly including whole interwar lithuania . 
  commonwealth idea was already shelved , because pi\u0142sudski lost support of parliament ( remember , dmowski was his opponent ) , and war with soviets was over ( * endecja * and soviets divided belarus & ukraine in two , which was nothing like he dreamed ) . 
  it was about wilno , surroundings and a little about mutual border with latvia . 
  however , there was an unsuccessful attempt ( coup ) to set up pro-polish government in kaunas few years before , in 1919 ( against sle\u017eevi\u010dius ) . 
  pi\u0142sudski knew about it . 
  now you laugh . 
  and then you remember what finns managed in 1939-40 , and you do n't laugh anymore . 
  btw , there was a weird video of finnish guy screaming and hitting himself on the head , ca n't find it now . 
  anybody ? 
   pilsudski was very keen to restore pre-partitions commonwealth . 
  including whole lithuania and ukraine . 
  yes , but as a modern , democratic confederation of three states ( poland , ukraine , and `` great '' lithuania , which was to be divided into three `` cantons '' itself - kaunas , wilno and minsk - depending on major nationality/language there ; kaunas canton would be rougly comparable in borders to interwar lithuania ) , with common currency , army , foreign policy etc. 
  of course poland would be a leading country in such polity . 
  you can compare it to yugoslavia - poland like serbia , but more 1919-29 / 1945-80 than 1929-41 . 
  such confederation was meant to be a leader of greater block itself , including other baltic countries , finland , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan , don & kuban cossack states ... and may be even czechoslovakia , hungary , romania etc. 
  beautiful dream , but sadly only a dream . 
  unfortunately petlyura lost in 1920 , lithuanians were n't keen about that idea ( that 's why pi\u0142sudski eventually decided to `` save '' at least his native wilno via '' \u017beligowski 's coup '' ) , and * endecja * ( national-democrats of dmowski ) won elections in poland - and they preferred smaller country , but with polish majority , and assimilation of remaining minorities . 
  more e.g. 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) ( mi\u0119dzymorze / intermarium mentioned there was a broader idea however ) . 
  i can look for some actual literature , but it would be in polish and rather not available online . 
  however i 'm sure somebody at least sketched in lithuanian . 
   they say dutch droppings taste like licorice !, 
  i always thought it was the other way around . 
   how exactly are we going to suffer by severely limiting immigration from islamic countries ? 
  how is this going to be bad ? 
  limiting immigration is ok ( although in the meanwhile we should fight problem in source - on ground , in syria ) . 
  i 'm talking about discrimination against muslims who are already here . 
  i think we can handle them ** peacefully ** . 
  problem is that bandera was a bad guy murdered by ** very bad ** guys . 
  ukrainians unfortunately remember only the second part . 
  nope , this one actually started itself ( as clashes between poles and ukrainians in lw\u00f3w ) , without involvement of warsaw . 
  and eventually pi\u0142sudski was a supporter of independent ukraine ( with petlyura as a president ) , without lw\u00f3w however . 
  exactly . 
  only our ethnic cleansings ended 50 years before yours . 
  i like that . 
  also , happy cake day !, 
   the european right is never going to ally with islam of course . 
  but their aims are actually similar ( to islamists ' one ) . 
  both sides want war . 
   not because they are gon na do us much harm , but because it has fueled the far right and its gaining momentum and its not gon na slow down . 
  nobody could predict that . 
  there was no global islamism when first muslim immigrants came to europe ( in 1960s-70s ) . 
   it has to do with representative democracy that becomes completely useless when one party is the polar opposite of the other . 
  oh , believe me i know it . 
  we have exactly such group here in poland . 
  problem is that they are poles too , so we have to live with them . 
  or they with us . 
  so we live on . 
  what 's even worse that i 'm sure they think exactly the same about us . 
   i was bullied in the school , i was beaten regularly , i had shit thrown at me and i had my head put in toilet . 
  and you got over it . 
  but some people are not strong enough . 
  one will hang oneself in the attic . 
  other one will get a gun and show the world his `` feelings '' . 
  that 's the problem . 
  european right and islamists are actually allies , even if they do n't notice it themselves . 
  both parts do n't want muslim refugees or immigrants ( including generations already born & raised here ) to feel welcome , both sides want to fuel alienation and discrimination . 
  there 's one problem . 
  for many of them , here = home . 
  born and raised . 
  some are even converts ( actually percentage of those among wearing the veil is higher than among european muslims in general - obvious case of `` neophyte zeal '' ) . 
  and by the way , some women became christian nuns for very similar reasons ( especially in closure orders ) . 
  so why are n't we banning it as well ? 
  plus `` dutch dropping here for a looong time '' . 
  [ ... close enough ? 
  polarization . 
  shift to right would mean persecution of european muslims , which would lead more of them to feel discriminated , and compelled to `` choose a side '' . 
  in the end , it would lead to `` it 's them or us '' mentality on both sides . 
  moderate centre would get smaller and forced to sit on barricade . 
  there would be more suicide attacks ; and there would be pogroms . 
  in such scenario , even if islamists lose ... they actually win . 
  isis does n't want muslims to feel well in europe .
