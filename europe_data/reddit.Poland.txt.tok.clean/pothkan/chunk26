  because peaceful , tax-paying muslims are n't their supporters . 
  but a muslim who feels to be a worse citizen ; who ca n't get good education or job because of his looks or clothing ; who from both sides ( right and isis ) hears that he 's not wanted here ; who 's born and raised in ethnic ghettos - he is a terrorist material . 
   are you sure women want to be dressed in burkas ? 
  there are definitely some who do . 
  watch docus where such women are interviewed . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hhhad_nzu ) ( subtitled in english , commentary is a little one-sided so you might skip it , but it 's worth to listen just to women themselves ) . 
  notice that many decided to veil against wishes of their family ( so it 's kind of youth rebellion ) , and before marriage - so without any outside pressure . 
  one even divorced because her husband was against her veiling . 
  actually , it might be quite similar ( in weird way ) to radical feminists - i mean those who do n't ( did n't ) wear make up , who burned bras etc. 
  both groups reject `` western beauty / fashion model '' , both say it 's `` objectifying '' women . 
  on the other hand , of course some women are forced to wear such clothing , but i 'm not sure if it 's happening often in europe ( contrary to middle east , not even talking about isis where it 's compulsory ) . 
  i think we would hear more about such cases . 
  then of course it should be treated as domestic abuse and properly persecuted . 
   here in germany , women are most certainly not pressured into wearing high heels or undergoing cosmetic surgery . 
  still , some women do it , although it 's definitely more unhealthy than niqab . 
  so should we ban it ? 
  of course not . 
  neither we should ban niqab . 
  or walking topless . 
  what somebody wears , is her/his decision . 
   from age 12 lest you burn in hell fire and bring shame upon your family ( who may or may not kill you to preserve their honour ) first , i 'm talking about adult people . 
  second , i think that anybody who forces another person to wear something , should be fined and persecuted . 
  but if somebody wants to do it on her own - it 's her body and her choice . 
  and actually many , if not most of women doing so in west do it on their own decision , for different reasons , sometimes even against wishes of their parents . 
  it 's another thing . 
  `` sharia police '' should be persecuted . 
  nobody should dictate what somebody wear ( or does n't ) , except this somebody her/himself . 
  france is best known and was first introducing it . 
  true about belgium , but in switzerland it 's only one canton ( ticino ) , and dutch ban is not total , only in some places ( like schools , hospitals etc. 
  - not in street ) . 
  you mean that there is no pressure at all in our western fashion ? 
  high heels ? 
  cosmetic surgery ? 
   yeah they killed lots of civilians but same thing happened in wwii . 
  and where do you see me saying it 's ok ? 
  i did n't justify ** anything ** above . 
  if something does n't fall within the definition of e.g. 
  terrorist attack , it does n't mean it 's ok . bad things have many names . 
   like i said shia terrorist have probably killed more civilians than sunni terrorist nope . 
  shia soldiers or militiamen - may be . 
   but hey it happened in wwii so its ok . 
  i do n't think so . 
  but hey , it 's your opinion . 
  again , my point short . 
  suicide organised terrorist attack against random civilians - it does n't sound shia . 
  it is , if somebody wants to wear it . 
  freedom means being able to do stupid things too . 
   syrian government is run by shias . 
  they are alawis . 
  branch indeed , coming from shia islam , but with some distinctions . 
  think about shia like about orthodoxy or protestantism in christianity - there are many different , smaller groups . 
  if you consider alawis just a shias , you 'd have to say same about druzes . 
   shia militias have killed tens of thousands , if not hundreds of sunni civilians . 
  i also noticed you ignored several of my sources . 
  again , these were not terrorist attacks . 
  just `` plain '' ( obvious sarcasm ) ethnic cleansing during the war . 
   you even admitted there was shia terrorism of course . 
  my point is that shia terrorists do n't do `` blind '' suicide attacks against civilians . 
  by the way , same could be said about right-wing extremists . 
  take breivik for example : bombing of government building and killing of ( from his point of view ) political opponents . 
  not random . 
  again , i 'm not defending anybody here . 
  i just want to point ** tactics ** . 
  yesterday attack just does n't sound to by perpetrated by shia terrorist group . 
  period . 
  random attack against civilians can mean one of two things : either muslim sunni terrorism , or non-afilliated madman commiting suicide ( example : killing sprees in us schools ) . 
  may be . 
  that 's why we have to fight `` easy answers '' and try to stay sane . 
  in the moderate ** centre ** . 
  perpetrators of burgas 2012 are still unknown . 
  and buenos aires is an example of ** targeted ** attack ( israeli ** embassy ** ) . 
  and if you consider rocket attacks in 2006 a terrorist attacks , same should be said about mutual aerial bombings in ww2 . 
  and of course shabiha are n't shia , but syrian government militia . 
  just to be clear : i do n't try to justify or excuse shia terrorists . 
  i 'm only trying to point , that random suicide attacks against civilians are not typical for them . 
  shia attacks ( at least in israel ) are mostly targeted , not blind `` scare '' attacks against civilians . 
  of course , they do n't mind collateral damage , but contrary to sunni extremists , they consider civilian victims as `` necessary evil '' . 
  same in iraq - they targeted political opponents and occupying forces , not civilians . 
  examples ? 
  suicide attacks both in israel and iraq were/are done by sunni terrorists . 
  in israel it 's hamas , al-aqsa , islamic jihad etc. 
  in iraq - al-qaeda , post-baathists and lately isis . 
  they do n't really commit suicide attacks against civilians , even in israel they mostly target military and police . 
  and most of shia terrorist groups are closely working with iran . 
  so just as well he could be a right wing nutjob . 
  they are extremists too . 
  iran has no interest in organising terrorist attacks in europe . 
  so you want a final solution ? 
  this does n't bode well . 
   make it quite clear to anyone wanting to immigrate to europe that women can dress however they want unless it 's france . 
   the shift to the right is inevitable which is precisely what isis aims for . 
  they want to wage a civil war in europe . 
  shia extremists are enemies of sunni extremists . 
  isis fights with shias in iraq , and iran supports assad in syria . 
  iranian alliance with hamas is strongly about being against israel . 
  and in syria iran openly supports assad . 
  australia & canada : big countries with young history and small multicultural population ; norway & switzerland : egalitarian societies with long history of safety and peace ( norway was occupied by nazis , but it was n't a harsh occupation ) ; singapore : small city-state with technocratic government ( one party in power since ... ever ) , trading some freedom for prosperity ; and of course geography helps here a lot ; and japan is ... japan . 
  i do n't think i need to convince anybody that it 's unique ;  you think the uk is not a unique country i never said that . 
  of course , uk is unique . 
  but same could be said about nearly any other country .
