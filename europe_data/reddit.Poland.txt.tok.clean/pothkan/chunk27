  poland is unique too . 
  as is portugal . 
  or thailand . 
  my point : you ca n't look at some country ( norway , switzerland , singapore etc. ), 
  and think you can copy their success . 
  it would be mistake comparable to well-known `` bilbao effect '' - in this spanish city a museum designed by star architect frank gehry lead to local boom in tourism and general prosperity . 
  many cities tried to follow this example . 
  it was repeated nowhere . 
  all are unique examples , not possible to copy . 
  turbofolk stuck in your head . 
  it 's awful . 
  but amazing . 
  but awful . 
  not similarly , risk would be definitely much , much lower . 
  it 's worst for dark skinned ( middle eastern looking , but e.g. 
  latino could be easily mistaken ) and people in muslim clothing ( e.g. 
  women with headscarves ) . 
  then blacks . 
  it also heavily depends on place . 
  warsaw , cracow or tricity ( most used to tourists ) are pretty safe . 
  not ever talking about road safety . 
  poland and romania compete for first place in deaths per 100,000 people . 
  our/their number is roughly 2 , 3 times bigger than western / southern europe . 
  and do n't forget to take a photo at famous charles ' bridge over the vistula river . 
   something tells me the final battle will be fought at the pirate bay . 
  there will be no final battle . 
  free side will win just like russians in 1812 - avoiding enemy and waging war of attrition . 
  copycats everywhere . 
  they found deposit of coal under the old city . 
  interesting trivia : during the destruction operations american crew come to most and shot some footage for use in * the bridge at remagen * movie . 
  it was in 1968 . 
  eventually they had to flee in taxis ( when soviets & us invaded czechoslovakia ) . 
   do n't know about the west but here in east we will always have rutracker the problem with rutracker is that it 's sometimes hard to find a copy of movie or series without russian ** voiceovers ** . 
  and even if you do ( e.g. 
  it can be turned off via different audio channels ) , version is often not compatible with subtitles ( available elsewhere ) . 
  most of its empire was in asia , however . 
  and 1453 was kind of coup de grace - byzantines were pretty much already screwed , thanks to french & italians ( ekhm ekhm 1204 ) and seljuks ( ok , they were turks as well ) . 
  sure . 
  but only one pillaged half of europe . 
  is it the mustache ? 
   i understand why military personal and police is being crackdown on but why teachers , university deans , judges , staff in the finance ministry , people working in the prime minister 's office , interior ministry workers and the media ? 
  look up reichstagsbrand . 
  using unsuccessful attack on your power to get rid of any opposition , even if it had nothing to do with that attack . 
   remember the ~ ~ turkish ~ ~ mongol hordes that pillaged half of europe ? 
  ftfy . 
  problem is that people are generally good and nice , but still can support something bad and nasty . 
  i know few pis ( our populist , erdogan-ish ruling party ) hard-core voters , and most of them are just ok ( as long as you avoid politics in conversation ) . 
  but let 's be sincere , same could be told about 1930s germans . 
   not to say poland did n't create any islamic terrorist , as opposed to countries where ( arabic / maghrebi ) minorities are much better treated like france , belgium and england . 
  you know , there is probably more muslims in medium-sized french town than in whole of poland ( recent estimates are ~ 20-30k people in 38m country , which is less than promile ) . 
  she was n't sitting , but standing in open space near the door . 
  which made it even more obvious when people were avoiding her . 
  and personal space is n't such big deal here as scandinavia , although of course more than romance nations . 
  we 're rather normal about it . 
   just how i 'll avoid sitting next to a homeless man it was exactly like that . 
  but you know , homeless would probably stink ( sometimes you know there is one inside before you enter the train ) . 
  plus they are sometimes weird ( like if you sit near , he will try to speak with you , or worse ) . 
   well , france has had plenty of firsthand knowledge and it does n't seem to have helped the situation . 
  france had and has its own , specific problems and reasons of present situation . 
  still , islamophoby levels are ** much ** lower than in eastern / ec europe . 
   there are other ways , you know , like , shock , reading statistics and polls of general attitudes/social norms of various groups and nations . 
  true , but it does n't help here as well . 
  majority of poles do n't read books . 
  ** at all ** . 
  so again , if you do n't get your knowledge either first-hand , or from respectable sources , where do you get it ? 
  tv , tabloids and anecdotes . 
  seriously , sometimes i think our car culture is comparable to american gun culture . 
  it 's toxic , but nobody cares enough to change it with a harsh hand . 
  ( on the other hand , it 's interesting that while americans definitely have a problem with their guns , they are considered to be responsible , good and safe drivers ... ) . 
   not even putin would do stuff like this ... ekhm ekhm second chechen war ekhm ekhm . 
  but yeah , putin was more patient . 
   no , the world was very aware what happened in europe during that time , only when the third reich got scarily big and attacked russia and their own allies , us and uk finally got their asses up and intervened because they got scared . 
  i think you should check your history books . 
  it 's not how it happened . 
  there 's pretty much `` something happening '' since at least six-seven years . 
  we might think 2016 is special , because lots of bad things happened in just few days . 
  so , let 's wait with reviews until next year . 
  but do gulen is really behind the coup ? 
  or is erdogan just using the coup to get rid of him ? 
  sorry , did n't get it at first . 
   now guess what comes next , what started many years ago , but will continue when he is in charge ? 
  he will continue `` cleaning '' turkey . 
  he will introduce sharia law . 
   he will put turkey back into the stone age , similar to what happened with iran a few years back . 
  just a little different . 
  i doubt it . 
  erdogan does n't seem to be driven by islamism . 
  he 's just a power hungry authoritarian . 
  he wants absolute power only for the sake of having it . 
   tbh it sounds more like eurasia to me . 
  i think you meant eurabia . 
  buy yeah , otherwise i agree . 
  it 's like they started even before the coup . 
  i do n't believe it was all erdogan 's making ( i think it was a real thing ) , but is clear as f. . . that he 's using this opportunity to get rid of any future opposition . 
  or just people who looked him in wrong way . 
  it 's 100 % cultural . 
  genes or `` blood '' have nothing to do here . 
  contrary to upringing , education and surroundings . 
  according to most statistics we have ** highest ** road fatalities ratio in whole eu ( some place poland in second place , after romania ) . 
  polish roads are much better than 10-15 years ago ... but polish drivers are n't .
