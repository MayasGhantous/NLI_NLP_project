  it was the same plane however , original flight was cancelled because of weather ( there was an extreme rain ) . 
   the irony as polish people are really scared of refugees because we are an extremely heterogenous nation for last 70 years , and most of poles know muslims only from media . 
  guess how they are portraited there . 
  lack of first hand knowledge leads to xenophoby . 
  saw a girl in hijab ( just simple headscarf , long dress etc. , nothing extreme - on the other hand , it 's a very rare sight in poland , may be except warsaw ) on urban rail few weeks ago . 
  it was pretty crowded , and still there was a visible space around her . 
  she did n't even look middle eastern , obviously was a tatar or polish convert . 
   you 'll never be more german than they are ( no offense , it 's just ... the truth lol ) . 
  nationality is cultural , not biological . 
  may be because maltese language is very closely related to arabic ? 
  actually it even sounds like weird child of arabic and italian . 
  polonia !, 
  lol , [ velos a rebours ? 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_city_gate ) building is pretty famous example of brutalism as well . 
  and nationalist . 
  i think kurds should be worried . 
  still , military junta is even worse news . 
  erdogan might be an ass , but he was elected fairly . 
   a coup , even a failed one , will only afford legitimacy to the akp . 
  actually another coup ( somewhen in 1990s ) was a fuel to future akp . 
  they often have criminal ( non-terrorist ) past , even connection to drugs and `` party life '' , plus long term lack of legal employment . 
  i bet some of that will surface about nice attacker as well . 
  just curious : what 's your stance on form of government of scotland , if it would get independence ? 
  republic like ireland or monarchy like canada/australia ? 
   exactly . 
  as we all know , even the peasants walked around in shining armour back then , not just a small elite warrior caste . 
  `` help !, 
  help !, 
  i 'm being reppressed !, 
  by the way : i 've seen somewhere in past results of research or poll with question `` do you feel to be an equal citizen '' , made among muslims in different western countries . 
  results were lowest in france ( highest in us or canada ) . 
  ca n't find it now :(, 
   holding no ground did n't impede al qaeda much did it . 
  still , al qaeda was much less successful in `` lone wolf '' propaganda . 
  they pretty much had to organize attacks themselves . 
  in the result those were much more rare , although spectacular . 
   the attacks wo n't stop if isis has no territory . 
  no territory = much less money . 
  also , notice that their propaganda is based on `` building a successful islamic state '' . 
  in syria & iraq . 
  isis is losing ground as we speak . 
  it could take months , weeks , may be few years - but i 'm sure we 'll win . 
  so why it 's happening in france and belgium , but not ( or on much lower scale ) in germany , uk , sweden or netherlands ? 
  there must be some differences - either between muslim populations in these countries , or state policy concerning them ( not necessarily present one , there might be some mistakes done already decades ago ) . 
  endure . 
  it will pass . 
  i know it 's not an easy answer , but it 's the only one . 
   getting more help from within the muslim community problem is that those people are n't necessarily involved into local muslim communities . 
  very often they are lone wolves ( single , unemployed etc. 
  ) , brainwashed via internet . 
  still , more caution among muslims might help . 
  so french president 's barber earns more than polish president , prime minister and parliament speaker ** combined ** . 
  i do n't even know how to comment that . 
  true . 
  on the other hand , `` english '' curry is not really similar to original indian kind . 
  this . 
  also , they also want us to hate european muslims , so they will feel forced to either flee to is , or fight us . 
  rise of islamophobia is is 's fuel . 
  kebab , couscous and harissa . 
  it wo n't do anything . 
  these people are already in france , born there ( 2nd , 3rd generation ) or even native converts . 
  unfortunately french can only persist . 
  we will eventually win and it will pass . 
  assailant might have nothing directly connecting him to is . 
  it looks like lone wolf attack , ** inspired ** ( not directed ) by is . 
  still , i 'm sure is will claim responsibility . 
  they want to wage fear and hate for muslims in europe . 
  seriously all you in balkans , please just stahp . 
  did it worked better than why did n't you invest in eastern poland ? 
  actually name is connected . 
  salad was invented in 1900s , when macedonia was known to be a mess of different nations & religions . 
  very colourful on maps . 
  actually fiume was hungarian and ragusa independent . 
  also , turkey had a tiny strip which eventually landed in bih hands ( yes , fun fact : bih ** is not ** landlocked ) . 
  no , worse . 
  * ( polski fiat/fso ) [ 125p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polski_fiat_125p ) ( `` large fiat '' ) - quite decent car , crude insides , but good and reliable engine . 
  * ( polski fiat/fso ) [ 126p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_126#polski_fiat_126p ) ( `` small fiat ; a little one '' - ** maluch ** in polish ) - nothing really good ( although it was easy to maintain & park ) , but legendary because it was our `` car for the people '' , symbol of private motorisation . 
  over 3m of them built . 
  * fso [ polonez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fso_polonez ) - crap , especially later years . 
  mostly because our industry fell into oblivion then . 
  fso tried to sustain & modernize it in 1990s ... but if you had a choice between this , even new , and second-hand good western/japanese car ( or later , new quite cheap korean ones ) ... choice was pretty obvious . 
  aka the worst car sold in the 1980s west until we tried to sell polonez ? 
   they are trying to conquer 3 m2 of our sea so that they can have access to the international waters . 
  you know , with all that sea you already have , you could share a little . 
   who had a pope ? 
  but they are so fanboyish they even wrote a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1vu9wrj14s ) about him . 
  and about how they love him . 
   books or films ? 
  poland : both , but books probably more . 
  lindgren was ( and probably still is ? ), 
  a popular children author . 
   if we can keep our language you mean swamp german ? 
  or just want to go where already lots of their compatriots live . 
  because they are pretty much assimilated . 
   xenophobia tends to be a problem of mono-cultures . 
  rather problem of getting knowledge from mass media . 
  but those countries have less unfavorable views with muslims already inside . 
  which was blown out of proportions by media . 
  so why percentage of anti-muslim views is lower in places where there is already visible number of them ( which means people interact in person ) , and higher where there are few , or none at all ( and local people know muslims from media or second-hand reports ) ? 
   dont forget hungary had the most applications and handled the most refugees during last year , it was a huge stress on that country , much bigger than any other country would have been able to handle .
