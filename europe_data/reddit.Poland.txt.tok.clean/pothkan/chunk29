  that 's one of reason why i find our ( polish ) attitude to be so awful . 
  taking refugees is n't only about them , it 's also about solidarity with our european brethren , like hungary or greece . 
  making their burden lighter . 
  west germans know even better . 
  i detect lack of logic . 
  but there was no voting . 
  every other candidate backed out . 
  what about pro/anti-eu division among tories themselves ? 
  may be they could split ? 
  theresa who ? 
  yeah , but berlin was partly west . 
  curious : would independent scotland become republic as ireland , or stay monarchy like canada or new zealand ? 
  exactly . 
  they get their knowledge mostly from media . 
  or `` cheap '' tourism in egypt , turkey etc. 
  ( if they even try , it 's mostly beaching in sun and all-inclusive drinks & meals ) . 
  what 's interesting ( a little funny , more sad ) , that average pole thinks [ there 's ~ 5 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/foamiif.png ) of muslims in poland , which would be ~ 2m . 
  although it 's not really different in other polled countries ( french result is especially ridiculous ) . 
  estimate is for 20-40k in poland , with 20-40 % of that being natives ( mostly tatars , some converts - although most of those seem to prefer living abroad , in west or middle east ) . 
  but it 's really hard to tell - there was no religion question in last censuses . 
  same about atheist , where estimates are between just 2 and even 10 % . 
  i live in quite big metropolitan area ( ~ 800k ) , and i might have seen no more than 10 or 15 `` visible '' muslims ( mostly women in hijab ) here ( some of course more than once ) , not counting times when i happened to be near local mosque ( one of 6 or 7 in whole country ) on friday ( it was near my uni ) . 
  it 's probably the same or less everywhere else here , with an exception of more `` multicultural '' warsaw . 
  poland is extremely homogenous in general . 
  probably more than 95 % are polish-catholic , with rest being mostly just polish-protestant , orthodox or atheist ( no visible differences ) . 
  major national minorities - germans and belarusians - are located in high numbers in small areas , and also not really different . 
  there also two regional minorities , but not entirely recognized , silesians and cashubians ( again , not more different than e.g. 
  galicians in spain or frisians in germany ) . 
  black or asian people are a rare sight as well ( the latter one a little less , because there 's ~ 50k vietnamese minority ) . 
  also , anti-muslim views in germany seems to be highest in the east , were actually less muslims live . 
  so not only polish 90s music was awful . 
  no , it 's just a very strong tea . 
  the kind which colours the pot or glass brown . 
  i think that here in poland it 's more about obligatory waste collection contracts , so people would n't throw their garbage wild in the forest ( which unfortunately is a big and very shameful problem ) . 
  we have three types of bins : yellow ( plastic/metal ) , blue ( paper ) and green ( glass ) , and last one has to be used quite rarely ( glass is much more rare as waste as other ones ) . 
  plus old garbage bins are used for organic waste . 
  if you 're worried , i can assure you that nobody really hates you for ** potop ** ( not topot ) now . 
  wounds are old enough . 
  or rather overshadowed by later history . 
  still , giving back at least ** some ** of loot would be a very nice gesture . 
  changes . 
  and lis is editor of newsweek now . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4s5wyz/cover_of_polish_weekly_poland_against_homoempire/d56tgyk not precisely on homosexuals , but this should say you a little our present government . 
  now you made me afraid of coast pillaging norwegians . 
  i do n't want to be sacrificed in bl\u00f3t :(, 
  [ polan stronk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xtgvdrx.png ) ( a little old but surprisingly relevant ), 
   still laughing ? 
  what choice do we have ? 
  they kidnapped our state . 
  until next elections ( autumn 2019 ) , we have no real way to oust them . 
  yeah , we can plead for help and hope europe wo n't forget us and wo n't integrate in the meantime leaving us behind ( i 'm really afraid about `` two speeds '' idea ) ... but it 's not like juncker or timmermans will come riding on a white horse :p, 
  still too soon . 
   people asked to lift it up will make a big deal about it . 
  we 'll have a leftist outrage each time anyone throws a tantrum . 
  police will then choose to effectively ignore those masked - just for peace and quiet . 
  simple solution - if a woman refuse to unmask , provide her with a ** female ** officer , clerk etc. 
  then she could n't refuse ( and even if she does , nobody serious would defend her ) . 
  it should n't be a problem , as in most of high-security areas there are already female employees , e.g. 
  for private search purpose . 
  i had no problems in elementary school while i started to skip religion in 5th or 6th class ( of course with parents ' permission ) . 
  on the other hand , in middle school i actually stayed , just because we had a fun teacher - a franciscan monk - and there was an open discussion about different subjects , like other religions or atheism ( he had no problems with me and few other people being openly atheist ) . 
  still , it was tricity - so again , major developed area - and one of `` liberal strongholds '' . 
  if nobody died then , we would have no problem now . 
  lech would just overwhelmingly lose president election in autumn 2010 ( his polls were ~ 15 % ) , while jaros\u0142aw ** nearly won ** premature ones in summer . 
  smole\u0144sk was a ** fuel ** to pis . 
  brother who died was n't so bad . 
  jaros\u0142aw was always more disturbing ... and death of his brother made it much , much worse . 
  sorry , nope . 
  but putin is their ally here . 
  nope . 
  it 's serious . 
  it 's not a major weekly , however . 
   is it just my perception or is there a massive right wing/conservative/nationalistic backlash breaking out across the western world ? 
  where were you for the last year ? 
  bearded hipster . 
  we really do n't know anymore . 
  there is a thin border between laughing and being scared here . 
  sigh ... time to get that lube :(, 
   you can feel it in the air when autumn comes :( you from cracow ? 
  i think that this case is more simple - it 's just suppressed mind . 
  i would rather get behind [ these guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdjepqwjteu ) . 
  feel the beat from the schleswig-holstein . 
  oh right , i forgot about this one . 
  and they dare to talk about `` dominating leftist media '' . 
  while in relays etc. 
  whole shelves are packed with rightist titles ... 
  same in poland . 
  baltic was a mess with closed beaches in 1980s . 
  bicycles . 
   if you know warsaw , go and find hotel sobieski how could anybody not now that abomination . 
  i want to puke everytime i see it ( which is luckily not often , as i visit warsaw about once a year ) . 
  i rather do n't agree with you ( united europe yes , conservative/low taxes no ) , but still - upvoted because of effort . 
  that 's a lot of words . 
   killing your children and people with pollution from coal is a `` traditional polish value '' ? 
  btw : we had a major recycling reform two or three years ago , introducing obligatory waste sorting into four categories . 
  some ( luckily not many ) people on their ( right ) side called it a `` leftist whim '' . 
  `` only three years left ... only three years ... '' . 
  that 's what i 'm telling myself . 
  i 'm not sure if i could bear seven , however . 
  the age of sigmar is coming !,
