  or [ this one ] ( http://egyptgiftshops.com/images/383a.jpg ) has `` not amused '' ( or just bored ) look . 
  and these are just photos - i assume real contact , with added voice tones or hand gestures , would tell even more about emotions . 
   i see a woman in trouble should i help her ? 
  -  well how do i know that she needs help ? 
  well , she could just ** tell ** . 
  and if you 'd find her unconscious ... then standard first help procedures should apply . 
   look how much you are resisting this one can you imagine how much would people resist if someone tried to ban more self harming practices ? 
  exactly !, 
  that 's why i 'm against such bans ( of course except things outside of harm principle ) . 
  i 'm speechless ... 
  although coming from a country which built [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basilica_of_our_lady_of_liche%c5%84 ) , i probably should n't criticize . 
   first we should tolerate that their women do n't have face hmm ... 
  i assume there ** is ** an actual ** face ** underneath the cloth . 
   next we should tolerate that they do n't have rights * au contraire * - and right to veil is one of them . 
  i repeat , i 'm against forcing any women to wear niqab . 
  people doing should be prosecuted . 
   banning extremely socially destructive practice is a good place to draw it i guess . 
  only if we would ban other comparably destructive practices as well . 
  which ca n't happen , of course . 
   porta makedonija is it a reconstruction of ruined ancient monument , or a new thing ? 
  because it looks very out of place between these two 70s-looking buildings . 
  i agree niqab can be considered impolite , but that 's not the reason enough to ban it . 
  on the other hand , imho eyes-showing niqab ( which is probably more popular than total one ? ), 
  is a smaller barrier than sunglasses , because eye contact is definitely more important factor in interpersonal communication than other facial expressions . 
  but nobody calls for sunglasses ban because of that . 
  also , nowadays we do lots of communication without seeing each other ( phones , e-mails , fb , reddit ... ) , and it does n't seem to be a problem . 
   women wear high heels even though it kills their ankles , undergo surgery pursuing photoshopped beauty standard , wax pluck and shave then makeup and dye just because they think it is expected of them . 
  so why should we ban niqab , but not high heels or beauty surgeries ? 
  ( which are definitely more harmful to health , btw ) ( of course , imho we should ban neither , i 'm just trying to prove a point )  in a perfect world people should be allowed to do whatever they want but this is not a perfect world . 
  then we should strive for it , not making steps back with adding more restrictions . 
   face veil specifically is currently being used as a political tool in many places , banning it is reasonable way to curb this political influence . 
  no , the way is difusing this issue , proving it 's pointless , or even contreffective . 
   but try proving that it is their choice and not maybe under pressure . 
  but can we prove it is n't ? 
  also , if we start to ban things done by people `` under pressure '' ... oh boy , it would be a loooong list . 
  but on the other hand : if there are women ( or even men ) who willingly e.g. 
  pierce themselves in different places ; get tattooed ; get cosmetic plastic surgeries ; dye their hair pink or green ; - so why would it be different if some just want to veil themselves ? 
   i 'm pretty sure preventing accountability , communication and openness is harmful to society . 
  in what way ? 
  they veil their faces , not voices . 
  quote : * ( ... ) only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others . 
  his own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant . 
  he can not rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so , because it will make him happier , because , in the opinion of others , to do so would be wise , or even right ... 
  the only part of the conduct of anyone , for which he is amenable to society , is that which concerns others . 
  in the part which merely concerns himself , his independence is , of right , absolute . 
  over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign . 
  * ( john stuart mill , * on liberty * ), 
  btw : relevant [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hhhad_nzu ) on issue in france ( english subtitles ) , with different voices and comments . 
   face veil is a tool to dehumanize women and force them into submission and obedience . 
  when it 's forced upon them - of course . 
  but what when they ** want it ** on their own , without any pressure ? 
  which is often the case among euro-muslims - weird , but true . 
  or use them to divert concern from something else . 
  or just to pretend being needed . 
  seriously ? 
  three women are causing unrest in 2-million country ? 
  with what ? 
  a piece of cloth ? 
   the customs are foreign so are jeans . 
  or sushi . 
   they are ** irrelevant ** in the context of the whole society exactly . 
  so why such hassle ? 
   thet do n't hurt anyone now anyone but these few women ? 
   but who know what the future will bring . 
  probably few more ? 
  niqab in france ( country with biggest muslim community in eu , 8-10 % = 5-6 million ) , banned few years ago , was/is worn by approximately 3,000 women . 
  which is about ** 1/1000 ** of muslim women in france . 
  there are already proposals of similar ban in our country , albeit i wonder if there is ** any ** niqab-wearing woman in poland . 
  duh , even just a hijab is an extremely rare sight . 
  think about that . 
  it 's just ridiculous . 
   better to play it safe rather than read in 30 years , how they failed to integrate them integrate ? 
  she 's latvian , married to another latvian . 
   especially considering that balts already have problems with minorities . 
  so what 's next ? 
  banning russian language in latvia & polish in lithuania ? 
  just freedom to do things which are n't ** harming ** other people . 
  in other worlds : your freedom is limited by freedom of others . 
  ** live and let live ** . 
   ( only for indentification would ba good enough reason ) . 
  then just make a law forcing these women to unveil when asked by policemen , judges , state officials etc. 
   i somehow think the population of latvia supports it as well so win - win . 
  such thinking can lead to banning anything practiced by non-majority . 
  i dunno , nose piercings . 
  or veganism . 
  more bans = less freedom . 
  period . 
  john stuart mill ftw . 
   because it 's their country and they have a right to do it but what if these women are latvian as well ? 
  woman mentioned in article is one . 
  also , i do n't say latvians ( or any other nation ) have no right to do it . 
  only that it 's stupid . 
  pathetic . 
  calling it a red herring would be an understatement . 
  [ old but relevant ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/robin-lustig/niqab-ban_b_3959671.html ) . 
  imho niqab is stupid , but as a libertarian i loathe such petty bans even more . 
   1993 - dissolution of czechoslovakia however , it was a lucky case of clear border , with no need of ethnic transfers . 
  what is it ? 
  beside obvious bus stop , of course . 
  both , unfortunately .
