  worse , because without barely naked women . 
  nope . 
  what they covers say it 's what scary . 
  but quality of these covers - that 's what funny . 
  nope , they are serious . 
  problem is that those guys here are quite similar to guys who wanted you to vote leave . 
  it 's the same wave . 
   one example : there is no left leaning political party in the polish parliament at all . 
  mostly because `` left '' was usurped by postcommunist party ( sld ) . 
  i 'm centre-left myself , but would never vote for them . 
  and i suppose there 's more people like me . 
  so we need demise of sld so new , non-postcommunist left could emerge . 
  razem is a good sign ( although they did n't get into parliament ) , but what we need is a real centre-left party . 
   the problem with that is that polish church seems to have not progressed much from the era of counter-reformation . 
  i 's not that it did n't progress . 
  it 's that it stopped , and even regressed . 
  mostly because of john paul ii - it was like `` we have polish pope , everything is great , nothing should be changed ! '' . 
  and after his death they pretty much stayed in place . 
  all that while most parties ( including postcommunists ) sucked their ... fingers . 
  palikot was an exception ... but he was also a clown , unfortunately . 
  my hope is that in future decades something like in spain would happen . 
  compare number of non-believers there in 1975 and now . 
   not attending the lessons is very rare , often results in ostracism among younger children depends on location . 
  in major cities it 's not a big deal . 
  but everywhere else ? 
  yeah . 
  you bet . 
  polish stereotype of sweden : gay & conquered by muslims . 
  running wild in streets and raping everything around . 
  also , ikea . 
  oh , and [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) ) , but probably only because the [ movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fszao1llfy&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4138 ) is rerun very frequently . 
  if you ask about format , it 's a weekly news magazine - something like stern or spiegel in germany . 
  we have quite a lot of those in poland . 
  two major ones are polityka ( self-owned , centre-left ) and newsweek ( axel springer/german-owned , centre ) , both anti-pis . 
  and then a number of competing pro-pis titles , like wprost , uwa\u017cam rze , do rzeczy and gazeta polska . 
  of those four , uwa\u017cam rze is bearable ( `` old '' conservative ) , and do rzeczy & gazeta polska are * the worst * ( not counting some other , marginal titles , like openly antisemitic warszawska gazeta ) . 
  there are also few minor centre/left titles , and very highly circulating church-owned go\u015b\u0107 niedzielny ( which is not openly involved in political debate ) . 
  homophobic obsession of our polish right . 
  so yeah , day like everyday . 
  we think their covers are ridiculous and funny ( as in : so bad that it 's funny ) . 
  they not , because they have no sense of humour . 
  quote from pis foreign minister , interview with bild , january 2016 :  we just want to cure our country from several diseases , so it could heal . 
  previous government pursued specific concept of leftist politics . 
  as if the world must go in one direction of marxist pattern : new mix of cultures and races , world made of ** bikers ** and vegetarians , who use only renewable energy sources and combat any manifestations of religion . 
  it has nothing to do with the traditional polish values . 
  so yeah , these guys really think so . 
  please help us . 
   however , this sub deeply hates muslim immigrants majority of people in europe do , in poland even overwhelming . 
  so i would be actually surprised for this post to stay over 0 . 
  but on the other hand , such things happened in past . 
  reddit can be actually pleasantly surprising . 
  on the other hand one should notice that corrida is at least a little ** fair ** - both sides risk their lives . 
  bull has chance to fight back . 
  animals shot in commercial hunting do n't . 
  but it 's corrida what 's hated more . 
  ( still , i think both things are disgusting ... killing animals for sport is just wrong ), 
  on one hand , true , bandera was a leader of highly nationalist , even fascist party ( oun ) , and collaborating with germans early in the war . 
  on the other hand , he was quickly dismissed and thrown in prison by nazis , and later was a symbol of anti-soviet resistance and killed by soviet assassins . 
  and that 's how he 's remembered now - average ukrainians do n't know about oun ideology or upa 's role in volhynian massacre . 
  they know these guys fought with the soviets , period . 
  tl ; dr he was a bad guy murdered by even worse guys . 
  it is n't really surprising . 
  polish lack of will to take syrian refugees is quite similar . 
  as there is only ~ 30 or 40,000 muslims in poland now ( 36m population ) , 7,000 more would mean ~ 20 % rise . 
  add to that extremely high level of media-fueled islamophobia , and you know why it was such a big deal . 
  ( i still think it would n't be a problem , as we could easily deal with such small number ), 
  which does n't mean conscripts are n't sometimes used for private purposes . 
  k\u00f6nigsberg was capital of [ eastern prussia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ostpreussen.jpg ) , which was divided between russia ( most ) and poland ( mostly masuria ) . 
  territories you 've mistakenly described are actually pommerania ( szczecin/stettin ) , lower silesia ( wroc\u0142aw / breslau ) and eastern brandenburg . 
  also , czechoslovakia has n't received anything in 1945 ( except getting back what they lost in 1938 ) . 
   poland got west prussia , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  yes we did , but it was already in 1920 . 
  only small parts of west prussia remained with germany in `` 1937 borders '' , e.g. 
  kwidzyn/marienwerder and elbl\u0105g / elbing . 
  and of course gda\u0144sk / danzig was a free city then . 
   honestly , the fact that their support did n't increase after the won elections that 's because voters ' base is highly divided , and movement between pis and anti-pis camp is minimal . 
  mental barricades are high and hard to cross . 
  and yeah , opposition is n't really helping . 
  i meant last , actually . 
  thanks both you for reminding me . 
  problem is that i ca n't really say `` let 's hope so '' , because such scenario would still be bad . 
   they can still endure the pressure from inside the country ( kod ) , and outside ( eu , usa ) for a bit . 
  it depends on what happens abroad . 
  if things go to shit ( e.g. 
  trump as potus , le pen winning in france , refugee crisis getting worse , terrorist attacks - everything could happen ) , nobody would care about our problems . 
   when they run out of money for that ** if ** they run out before 2019 . 
  nobody can know that for sure . 
  sincerely , i 'm a pessimist . 
  and who exactly in cdu called for revision of border in last , let 's say , 10 years ? 
  unfortunately , it 's mostly intelligentsia . 
  average pole do n't care about democracy or rule of law . 
  fact that it seems british , americans or french does n't as well is only a paltry consolation . 
  how is poster from 50 years ago relevant ? 
  marek jakubiak ( deputy of populist kukiz 15 group , rather friendly with pis , although still in opposition ) said recently that he met some pis deputies apologizing for recent mess , of course only privately . 
  so there are some people inside ( probably not many ) who are ashamed . 
  still , it wo n't mean anything ( they wo n't leave ) , until pis crumbles in polls . 
  which does n't seem to happen soon . 
  i live in tricity . 
  world war ii started here . 
  solidarity started here .
