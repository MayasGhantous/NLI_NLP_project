  and russia is close , although i think they have enough own problems now ( still ... argentina in 1982 had them too ) . 
  unfortunately just regular idiots . 
  i know such people ( with similar views ) in person , and i 'm sure they get no money from putin , 
   everytime any party wins elections they replace anyone at tvp not ** anyone ** . 
  management level yeah , but regular employees were mostly left alone before . 
  but now it 's changed - most of people thrown out by pis worked there for years , also during their previous rule ( 2005-07 ) . 
  also , po did n't thrown out journalists hired during this period , although of course they were often moved to less significant positions , like archives . 
  notice , that jan po\u015bpieszalski saved his very pro-pis talk show through nearly whole po period . 
  i 've heard they even supported turkey in its `` there was no armenian genocide '' stance . 
   when they say the command structure is being corrupted , what does that even mean ? 
  rather just using military resources for personal advantage . 
  examples : general is building a new house for himself , he would use soldiers ( remember , service is still conscript in russia ) to help , of course not paying them . 
  and military trucks . 
  or he would even lease them ( soldiers , cars ) to another people , and take money for it . 
  another example - smugling aboard naval ships or military aircraft . 
  it also concerns equipment and basic needs of soldiers . 
  general gets money for food and uniforms , he takes part of it for himself , and buys worse food / clothing . 
  and of course , selling military fuel . 
   ( such as the defence minister saying that some jews actually are plotting to take over the world ) it is n't really example of antisemitism , just conspiration theory . 
  pis very dislikes george soros , because of his promotion of freedom/liberal ideas . 
  and it happens he 's a jew . 
  also , there is a strong dislike on some jewish organisations in us , like anti defamation league , but it 's actually reasonable . 
  they are partially responsible for spreading stereotype of polish antisemitism , mostly because poland they know and remembers is poland of past - which was indeed , rather antisemitic . 
  and they are constantly demanding compensations for property of polish jews killed in holocaust . 
  polish-israeli foreign relations on the other hand , are very close , cordial even - no matter who rules in warsaw or tel aviv . 
  so yeah , antisemitic opinions might be more frequent than in the west , but still - overwhelming majority of poles is friendly to jews . 
  also , we do n't really need jews to fuel our xenophobia no more ... we have gypsies and muslims for that now :(, 
   you missed your history lessons , did n't you ? 
  3,000 are people who ** consider ** themselves jews . 
  but there are also many poles with jewish origin ( mostly mixed now ) . 
  it 's hard to tell how many , probably no more than 100,000 . 
  for example , both last first ladies ( present agata duda and former anna komorowska ) are polish/catholic , but of half-jewish origin . 
  one of polish names for cockroach is `` prusak '' ( `` prusak '' = prussian ) . 
  and there is verb `` oszwabi\u0107 '' = to deceive . 
  by the way : why do you call germany `` v\u0101cija '' ? 
  ( and lithuanians `` vokietija '' ) ? 
  navajo name is best :  b\u00e9\u00e9sh bich ' ahii bik\u00e9yah ( '' ** metal cap-wearer land ** '' ), 
   it 's rarely used now , mainly as pejorative . 
  it was also borrowed into polish as `` szkop '' . 
  another pejorative name for germans is `` szwab '' , from schwaben . 
   it 's similar in other slavic languages . 
  even more , it was borrowed by hungarians , romanians and turks ( old name for germany in turkish was nem\u00e7e ) . 
  so not hidden if spotted , 
  cities in commonwealth were mostly small , with exception of danzig/gda \u0144sk ( which was a `` free city '' , status comparable to `` free cities '' in hre , only with king of poland as sovereign ) and cracow . 
  still both were under 100,000 . 
  on the other hand , paris was only ~ 300,000 then . 
  also , warsaw was capital only since few decades then , and it was chosen because of good ( central ) location . 
  albeit it was a major city in the region ( mazovia ) . 
  why ca n't they distribute it across schools and hospitals ? 
  because their point is that this food is somehow contaminated or toxic . 
  distributing it for free would prove their lies . 
  that 's not a real cheese . 
  portugal , san marino and monaco : `` do we have a choice ? '', 
  all of them , even russia ( i mean people , not leadership ... ) . 
  is he really singing about cheese ? 
  polish , [ bundz ] ( http://www.niam.pl/rimages/crop/600/450/files/images/product/backup/product_3070_95551579385327157763094795965051.jpg ) . 
  which is unfortunately hard to buy in north . 
  not polish ... probably gorgonzola and blue stilton . 
  but generally i like nearly all kinds of european cheese ( even czech fried one , which is a murder to liver ... ) , although blue ones probably more than other . 
  also , i once ate an interesting norwegian cheese , ca n't remember its name . 
  it was dark orange in colour , quite soft and a little spicy . 
  quite good , although it might be an acquired taste . 
  please anschluss . 
  [ one of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_g%c3%b3rski ) former pis deputies ( died few months ago ) called voting obama into office in 2008 `` end of the civilization of the white man '' and obama himself `` black messiah of new left '' . 
  he was n't criticised or punished by party leadership . 
  he was also saying that poland should be a monarchy with jesus christ as a king , and that he would n't allow abortion even to his wife if she was raped . 
  it 's not funny if you live here . 
  so you think it would be better if they stayed home 24/7 and do n't offend us with their clothing going outside ? 
  is n't that contradictory ? 
  i support denmark . 
  [ here 's why ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ) . 
  sweden was basically scumbag steve of 17th century europe . 
  half of those seats should be granted to israel then ... as jews were half of polish deaths in ww2 . 
   while i do n't like it , if people want to wear it , be my guest . 
  exactly my feeling . 
   yes there is a tiny amount less freedom . 
  as with laws against nudity . 
  ( naturists are n't hurting anyone too ) . 
  and actually i 'm against bans on nudity , for the same reason . 
  so are we ok with total daily surveillance ? 
  i mean of course , unveiling ( at least for a moment , to identify yourself ) in public gatherings , banks , airport - it 's obvious . 
  but here it concerns e.g. 
  a woman taking a stroll . 
  or doing groceries . 
   in some countries it 's illegal to cover your face could you give examples ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  i mean , laws definitely set not with niqab in mind . 
   teachers , police officers etc. 
  should n't wear it either of course , here i fully agree . 
  unless it 's a teacher in private school . 
   as with everything nuance is the key , there 's no such thing as absolute freedom . 
  that 's my point . 
  complete ban with high fines is n't a sensible response . 
  it 's just a plain chicane . 
  and something to please xenophobic voter base . 
   it 's perfectly okay to ban it from certain public functions i agree . 
  but here we are talking about complete ban . 
  niqabi woman ca n't take a stroll to park veiled . 
  [ how dare you ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3743226/thumbs/o-erdogan-gollum-570.jpg?1 ) . 
   how will you draw the line between a mask that 's banned and a mask that 's ok ?
