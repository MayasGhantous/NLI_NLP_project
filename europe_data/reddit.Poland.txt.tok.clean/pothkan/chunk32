  far-left dreams and ideas shatter once faced with reality and dealing with implementation details . 
  i would just set special concessions . 
  like obligatory ** unmasking for identification ** ( = lifting it up or taking out for a moment ) in specific places ( bank , office , metro , airport etc. 
  ) , or if asked by officer of law . 
  which i think is already in force . 
  and if a woman deny it , yes - then i would fine her ( not necessarily so highly , but still ) . 
   a long , thought-out post and a short answer focused on literally 6 words out of it . 
  with some parts i agree , other i mostly answered in other posts here . 
  also , i frequently get short answers to my tl ; dr posts , so ... 
  i 'm used to it . 
   your dress sense is not more important that the country 's democratic system . 
  if freedom of a single person is limited ( as long it is n't something harmful to other people ) , that means there is less freedom ( tiny amount ) in that country . 
   i imagine many people dislike speed limits , but accept them as part of life in their country . 
  riding too fast can be harmful , actually even deadly harmful . 
  niqab is n't . 
  so then we should prosecute e.g. 
  closure monks & nuns . 
  not even talking about plain recluses/otaku . 
  exactly . 
  so niqab bans are n't really helping anyone ( except making xenophobes more comfortable ) . 
  it 's just a red herring . 
   wearing a burqua is always a voluntary choice . 
  not always , there are probably cases when woman is forced into it ( and such cases should be prosecuted ! ) . 
  but indeed , most often it 's voluntary . 
  so like it or not , it 's a personal freedom . 
  but the problem is , it does n't seem to be concerning mostly `` fresh '' immigrants . 
  i doubt if you 're right . 
  first , research ( in france , denmark , sweden ) proved most of them are citizens by birth - * ius soli * , and significant number ( 25-50 % ) even by origin - * ius sanguinis * ( white converts ) . 
  also , iran is actually a one of few muslim countries , where ** face ** veiling is rare . 
  yeah . 
  but fining & prosecuting definitely wo n't help them . 
  what if it ** is ** their country ? 
  sure , i agree such cases probably happen as well . 
  but then we should persecute ** forcing ** somebody to veil , not veiling itself . 
   then their parents born elsewhere and not integrated to the swiss society . 
  actually niqab wearing women in europe are quite often born in rather secularized and integrated families , or just plain converts , without muslim heritage . 
  for some of them it seems to be a kind of `` conflict of generations '' or `` protest against modern society '' . 
  from research made in [ denmark ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar/10/religion-islam ) :  the most fascinating figure of all , though , came from the danish researchers , who actually interviewed some of the covered women . 
  most were young , or at least under forty , and half of them were white converts . 
  i think this makes it entirely clear that in modern europe the burka is not an atavistic hangover , but a very modern gesture of disaffection from and rejection of society , which appeals to a certain kind of extreme temperament . 
  notice : half of those are converts . 
  according to another research , quarter of ~ 2k such women in france were converts as well . 
  so not only born & raised in europe , but with european origins . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://rrj.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/body-image.jpg ) ( from a similar debate in canada ) . 
  they were born there ? 
  still , it 's already working in france and belgium . 
  sneeze ? 
  and what if she does n't ? 
   it may help the situation of female muslims in europe . 
  like those who wear it on their own decision ? 
  which seems to be prevalent e.g. 
  among such women in france . 
  weird , but true . 
  hadiths do , however . 
  but that 's the thing - muslims do n't even agree on the case . 
  we ( europeans ) tend to view islam as a monolyth , but in reality it 's a patchwork of different branches and `` schools '' . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's mostly a cultural thing . 
  not exactly , actually in europe it 's even contrary . 
  it 's an element of some `` reformation '' branches of islam , which can be roughly compared to e.g. 
  puritans . 
  what 's similar in both cases , is `` literal '' reading of holy book or writings , and extracting precise rules based on it . 
   most muslims do n't wear them actually niqab is worn by majority only in saudi arabia and yemen . 
  and of course da'esh , which is also a single place where it 's compulsory ( just like it was in taleban afghanistan or somalia under al-shabab ) . 
  on the other hand , niqab ( + burqa ) comes to 2 % . 
  lowest of all seven states . 
   same reason we ca n't walk around wearing balaclavas . 
  of course . 
  who knows , there might be a [ nuclear submarine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balaklava#underground_submarine_base ) underneath !, 
   yes but not burqa or niqab specifically . 
  hijab , yes . 
  few examples : [ bosnia 1930s ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-yugoslavian-islamic-woman-in-niqab-and-burqa-carrying-basket-in-sarajevo-249572695.jpg ) , [ algeria 1900s ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6f/a5/77/6fa57748390a904b66281742c677f9be.jpg ) , [ central asia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/sart_woman_wearing_a_paranja,_samarkand.jpg ) , [ ottoman macedonia ] ( http://images-00.delcampe-static.net/img_large/auction/000/094/319/951_001.jpg ) , [ late 19th c. iran ] ( https://muhajabat.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/iranwomen.jpg ) , [ india 1940 ] ( https://www.google.pl/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2f2%2f2e%2fworking_committee.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fpurdah&amp;docid=cjj28e_pgmmqsm&amp;tbnid=0slrusucavelhm%3a&amp;w=458&amp;h=278&amp;hl=pl&amp;safe=images&amp;bih=513&amp;biw=1173&amp;ved=0ahukewivx5kazelnahxcwcwkhvt_b4c4zbazcb4ogzab&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) . 
  and some of these look actually worse ( more extreme ) than `` present '' niqab . 
  and here 's an interesting one : female ** ruler ** of one indian princely state , present at king george v coronation . 
  [ in burqa ] ( http://aligarhmovement.com/karwaan_e_aligarh/begum_sultan_jahan ) . 
   anti-mask laws are nothing new . 
  anti-mask laws with ridiculously high fines are , however . 
   burqas/niqab are rare in the muslim world and their widespread-ness is fairly new . 
  not really . 
  there was a period ( roughly 1930s-1970s , when veil was in ** retreat ** , but it was popular before . 
  however , due to globalization recently ( last ~ 30 years ) it appeared in countries , where it was n't present anywhere in past , like indonesia/malaysia or west africa . 
  and of course among 2nd , 3rd generation muslims and of course converts in europe . 
   we can thank saudi arabia for that sure , but not only . 
  popularity of muslim brotherhood in egypt was also a significant factor . 
  and there are some other organizations promoting niqab , e.g. 
  indian-originated tabligh jamaat ( very active in third world ) - which interestingly , is also rather apolitical and pacifist ( roughly something like jehovah witnesses , only muslim ) . 
  problem is that these laws are done post factum . 
  i said ** converts ** . 
  do i seriously have to explain it ? 
  i mean somebody who is e.g. 
  french , italian , polish by both birth and origin . 
  there are multiple cases of such women , and percentage of converts among niqab wearing ones is probably even bigger , than among `` regular '' muslims . 
  reason is simple : neophytes seem to be more `` zealous '' . 
  also , there is a problem of salafist/wahhabi proselytism , saudi founded mosques etc. 
  veiled women are not a problem , they are ** result ** of it . 
  you ca n't deport somebody to country which she is n't citizen of . 
  also , you would have to strip this person of her own citizenship first . 
  you seriously think wearing a tent is a crime worth it ? 
  my point : authorities should n't mess with what somebody wears ( or does n't wear ) . 
  it 's basic freedom . 
  niqab is very far from european values , but banning it is something ** opposed ** to them .
