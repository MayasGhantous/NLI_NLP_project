  he kinda started it as well , albeit was quickly exchanged for yezhov ... who was then exchanged for beria . 
  and `` exchanged '' here is an euphemism . 
  still , there was nothing antisemitic in great purge . 
  you mistake it for persecution of soviet jews in late 1940s - `` doctors ' case '' etc. 
  also , rule 36 . 
  i see that you live up to your nickname . 
  herpes ? 
   if it stays perfectly legal and normal to wear burkas - you wo n't neither get attention only if they are so ** common ** , that nobody notices them . 
  which happens only in muslim-majority countries , and not all of them ( i suppose niqab could still be standing out in turkey or indonesia ) . 
  but all those laws were introduced in locations where niqabs are actually ** rare ** . 
  france - about 2,000 in 70m country . 
  there was a commune in belgium ( introducing it before whole country did so ) , where only 1 or 2 such women were found . 
   nor get your face exposed/recorded that 's another problem . 
  how much of our freedom must we give out to feel safe ? 
  imho we already gave too much . 
  and i 'm not sure if it 's even working . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276352/binaries/tombradbryu.jpg ) . 
  question : how many niqab wearing women live in ticino ? 
  but not fined so highly . 
  sorry , but this just looks like a chicane to me . 
  but what if they were born here ? 
  salafist islam is unfortunately popular among converts . 
  on the other hand ... if you were a terrorist , would n't you try to ** not get ** attention before the attack ? 
  spain was in the middle of elections at the moment . 
   today 's political atmosphere is almost free of nationalism . 
  i did n't mean extreme nationalism ( albeit it 's on the rise , luckily still marginal ) , but national egoism and lack of solidarity . 
   so , why would such a thing be a `` single good solution for europe '' ? 
  because divided europe - as it is now - just does n't work . 
  it 's too lubberly . 
  because everything has to be agreed not only by eu institutions ( ep , ec ) , but also national governments ( which of course have veto right ... ) . 
  kissinger 's questions still ca ` nt really answered . 
  second , present times are proving that rodrik seems to be right of his trilemma . 
  that acommodation of democracy , national sovereignty and globalization ( in `` good '' meaning - freedom of movement , trade etc. ), 
  is impossible . 
  so we have to choose `` two of three '' . 
  so , we need european ** government ** , instead of present , unfortunately featureless and neutered commission . 
  such government should be chosen through european elections and formed by ep majority - just like government in any democratic country . 
  and of course , it would have to get more power ( thanks to democratic legitimacy ) , so such power should be taken from national governments . 
   that the eu is acting like they are above all countries . 
  because it should be so . 
  united ( federative ) state is a single good solution for europe . 
  however , what ** should ** be done is also what is ** impossible ** . 
  not in present nationalistic atmosphere . 
  but before 2015 poland was an important player , only if because of our size . 
  of course not germany or france-level , but similar to spain or sweden . 
  and now ? 
  we willingly put ourselves in another room . 
   so , polexit now ? 
  no , there is no chance - support for remaining in eu is luckily very high among population . 
  however what will surely happen , is our marginalization . 
  nobody will treat us seriously . 
  look at post-brexit meetings - there was no poland participating , only `` old '' eu members . 
  such thing would n't happen under previous government . 
   anyway , that law is not an issue because it does n't work , the parliament works on a new one . 
  no new law will be valid until government and president fix what they broke before . 
   but it support a complete reform of the eu , giving more power to the countries , on which i absolutely agree . 
  it would be devolution , not a reform . 
  what eu needs , is ** less power ** to the countries , and more to brussels ( and paralelly , eu president & commission being ** directly elected ** ) . 
  national governments deceiving people with `` blame brussels '' and `` hurr durr muh sovereignty '' rhetorics - here 's what is our ** real problem ** now . 
   why ? 
  hillary seems like a competent and experienced bureaucrat and diplomat . 
  true . 
  but problem is , that she is an epitome of establishment in a very anti-establishment atmosphere . 
  hungarians aka east asians of europe . 
  ( [ explanation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surname#order_of_names ) ), 
  some men just want to watch world burn . 
   * tuvalu is no more : how the ocean and the sand mining industry removed a country from the maps and what 's worse , nobody notices . 
  sinking of maldives is top news however . 
  actually , would n't such deal cover british pensioners living e.g. 
  in spain of france as well ? 
  exactly . 
  governments are trying to blame eu institutions for their own faults . 
  and it works , because people are blinded by * hurr durr muh sovereignty * . 
  i had a chance to visit both orp orze\u0142 ( our kilo ) and one of kobbens . 
  difference in size is just ridiculous . 
  and kobbens are rather claustrophobic , quite ww2 u-boat feeling . 
  actually they already were giving us tanks . 
  belarus too . 
   if we would have a more powerful eu president , i 'd be more inclined to agree but that 's my point . 
  eu commission should have more power ( while council/nat govs less ) , but on the other hand it should be elected by people , not appointed in inter-governmental talks . 
   so is everyone else appointed by parties . 
  justices , delegates , diplomats , list goes on . 
  judges or diplomats are n't politicians . 
  but president of eucommission is a political position , just like prime minister ( and btw , imho it would be more simple - and symbolic - to just rename him pm of eu ) . 
  seems you 're right , sueno = dream . 
  but both polish and english translates title to `` sleep '' . 
   on the one hand : feelings . 
  do n't care very much about those . 
  most voters do , unfortunately . 
   but that really does n't hinge on whether we elect juncker or our representatives do . 
  if juncker was elected ( and i do n't mean in person , just being a pec candidate of winning euro-party ) , nationalists could n't call him `` imposed '' or `` undemocratic '' then . 
  of course  now please hide these cut hands , it 's kinda creepy ... 
  so people would feel that their vote counts , that there is connection between them and `` them '' . 
  now , ep elections are mostly transfer of national politics . 
  look at tories - for last years they were part of unsignificant group in ep . 
  did anybody in uk cared about it ? 
  or even noticed ? 
  did it have any repercussions ? 
  not really - because most of deals were done at inter-governmental level . 
  on the other hand , i think that ep politics should be more ** confrontational ** on inter-group level .
