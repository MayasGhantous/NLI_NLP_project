  for example , if epp wins , it should form commission - and pasd would land in opposition . 
  if winning group needs more seats for majority , it could join smaller group in coalition ( e.g. 
  alde or greens in present parliament ) . 
  you can say - what , more confrontations ? 
  how can it be a good thing ? 
  first , it would make ep politics more similar to national ones , so more clear for voters . 
  second , it would mean ** supranational ** alliances . 
  no german against french , but german & french ( etc. ), 
  christian democrats against german & french socialists . 
  ** ideas ** would be more important , than nationalities . 
  third , it would mean that if you ( = national party or politician ) want power in eu , you need to work with parties/politicians in other countries ( = be part of significant group ) . 
  i do n't have anything juncker himself , but problem lies elsewhere . 
  he is not ** elected ** by people . 
  we need ** directly elected ** high eu officials ( and with more power than now , at the cost of council ) . 
  the sleep of reason produces monsters . 
  nothing , for some idiots `` leftist '' is just an insult without real meaning . 
  it 's something like calling somebody `` nazi '' . 
  it gets much funnier once you actually have learnt latin . 
  you mean ** a ** rdeal ? 
  ^ please ^ do n't ^ call ^ pun ^ porice, 
  and invest !, 
  these are temporary exceptions . 
  all these countries are supposed to be adopting euro & joining schengen in future , although there are no deadlines . 
  except ireland & cyprus being out of schengen ( because of geography ) and denmark & sweden sticking to their crowns ( which i have mentioned above ) . 
   he even sold a big part of our goldreserves we stole fairly from the congo . 
  my bet is on secretary-general of the council of europe . 
  yeah , neither he is titled president , neither it 's eu institution ... but these are only facts , so gove might not care . 
  is somebody here ? 
  i thought i 've heard some distant voice ... 
  problem is that it mean national governments would have to be abolished , or at least heavily devolved ; and power of national parliaments limited . 
  but it would have to be national governments & parliaments agreeing on that first . 
  i really ca n't see it happening :(, 
   even the leftist parties in eastern europe are direct sucessors to the communist party . 
   what 's the difference ? 
  ruling parties or groups in non-democratic states ( especially totalitarian : communist , fascist , nazi , islamist - no difference ) and parties denouncing democracy ( like extreme far right ) should be treated outside of standard political spectrum . 
   it would be an embarrassment for the eu as well if they would accept them back . 
  unless uk `` trades in '' its hitherto special status , and becomes a regular member ( as everybody else except dk & se ) . 
  it would be a fair exchange , and imho best result of this whole mess . 
  great . 
  now we 're european dedicated backstabbers . 
  i would love to see it ... but unfortunately , doubt if it happen . 
  at least not in next few years . 
  on the other hand , polish media ( including state tv ) is quoted as source . 
  so hold your horses guys , it might be just propaganda from our right . 
  either leave , or return as a ** regular ** member , without hitherto privileges . 
  if `` reverse referendum '' would mean , that uk will `` return '' before it actually leaves , that 's great - ** as long ** as it would mean losing '' ** special ** status '' . 
  there should be some consequence of this whole mess you were dragging us in for months . 
  not `` leftist '' , but communist / soviet puppet . 
  of course he is done . 
  his career is over , his legacy is negative . 
  but is he ** the ** bad guy ? 
  in the end cameron was the main voice of bremain camp ( not counting snp ) , with lp abstaining from debate . 
  farage , johnson , murdoch - those are faces to be really punched here . 
  ... and now i crave for chevre . 
  ... and give turkey the same status . 
  oh , i would laugh soooo hard . 
  only that it could take tribute from you . 
   predictions on who the ~ ~ next ~ ~ last british prime minister will be ftfy , 
  brits are so beaten now , that argies & spaniards should quickly get back their clay . 
  uk wo n't even notice . 
   i would also go much more into directly democratic decision making . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  especially now . 
  get rid of the council . 
  weaken national parliaments & govts power , give more to ep & commission on one hand , and regional authorities on other . 
  at the same time , make ep & commission more directly democratic - with supranational campaigns & pre-declared candidates . 
  same with president - more power , but also being directly elected . 
  also , abolish single-country veto . 
  or actually make it so if somebody vetoes , majority threshold goes from from 50 % +1 to 2/3 . 
  exactly . 
  there might be some slight differences on `` how soon '' field , but otherwise it 's clear - uk wants to leave , uk has to leave . 
  we need british equivalent of * ` murica * . 
  `` there was never a plan '' . 
  this quote will land in history books . 
  and i though we are in stupid pos . 
  suddenly pis & po do n't look bad in comparison ... 
  he supported remain and lost . 
  his career ( and legacy ) is finished anyway . 
  he probably did n't resign with immediate result only because it would end in even bigger chaos . 
  so yeah , allowing the referendum is his fault ... but in the end he acts at least a little responsibly . 
   and i 'm stunned no one in the leave camp has made any plans for what happens next . 
  tories like gove or boris probably never believed it would happen . 
  and farage ? 
  he 's the guy throwing rubies away . 
   as for a redo ... 
  i would n't hold my breathe and i think that would make the uk the laughing stock of the eu uk was a drama queen of europe for last few months . 
  we are pretty much tired of that . 
  sure , i 'm sad you are leaving , but vox populi = causa finita . 
  it 's part of democracy - you have to live with its results . 
  and i 'm speaking from country , who made quite stupid choice last year . 
  i know , we would be able to change decision in few years , but still . 
  and who knows , may be you will want to return in future ? 
  yup . 
  it was probably `` go home polish scum '' at first . 
  but result is extremely bad in terms of declension , and word used for scum is kind of outdated . 
  polish `` translation '' is so bad , it 's actually hillarious . 
  i mean eu supporting spanish claim . 
  what if eu would support spain 's claim on gibraltar to ~ ~ bribe ~ ~ convince them ? 
   i think the referendum can be viewed as a rejection of the political establishment so you should vote cameron out , not use referendum as `` ersatz-protest '' . 
   brussels could give you a deal that includes passionate oral sex from all eu commissioners , no amount of access to this market can undo the damage you 've done by offending nearly everybody in the other 27 , not to mention antagonising and encouraging the euroskeptic morons in other countries , hoping to drag somebody else with you .
