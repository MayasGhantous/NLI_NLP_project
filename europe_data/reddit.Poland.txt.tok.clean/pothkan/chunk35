  this . 
  i would prefer bremain , but as other option won , screw you guys . 
  feel the pain . 
   i honestly do n't see how you can come back from this i see , and it would be simple . 
  reapply as anybody else , without any privileges . 
  and pray all 27 will want ( and vote ) you back . 
  could n't spain be bribed with gibraltar ? 
  as long as its citizens agree , which is probably possible , as long as madrid promise them wide autonomy ... ? 
   i doubt they 'll be able to act quickly though , westminster is too preoccupied do they need it ? 
  could n't scotland act unilaterally , both with referendum and ( if it succeeds ) independence ? 
  it 's not like uk would suppress secession with military ... 
  you mean brits are gon na roam the seas & rob ships , under the black flag ? 
  ask serbia . 
   it 'd probably go with p\u0105czki , kie\u0142basa , zapiekanka , makowiec or bigos . 
   eastern europe is the scotland of the eu , we get what they do n't want to keep . 
  our food is better though . 
   johnson - why hurry ? 
  nobody wants to be gravedigger of the uk . 
   deep fried pho omnomnomnomnom . 
  and that 's why we should be more open to immigrants . 
  of course not necessarily `` exotic '' ones ( although i do n't mind these ) , but e.g. 
  you know , i would exchange scottish cuisine for vietnamese one anyday . 
  those 3 millions working in the west are a clear benefit . 
  they would n't pay taxes here , because ** most ** of them would have no job - so they would actually cost money , being on social welfare . 
  not really , brexit would make both pound and euro falling down . 
  dollar and swiss franc will go up . 
   it 's just another pax germanica . 
  but it 's nice one for a change . 
  fourth time , germans actually did / are doing it right . 
  polandball ftw . 
   just do n't mention the 3 millions of people that moved to the west and now work and pay taxes there . 
  that worked great for our shitty demographics . 
  which of course has nothing to do with our unemployment rate falling down . 
   to reduce all the muslims coming in from pakistan . 
  what it has to do with eu ? 
   i think that 's an american thing . 
  they fly their flag turned upside down when in state of war . 
   and when king charles takes the throne . 
  would he remain charles then ? 
  you know , last king of this name was n't a lucky guy ... and there are cases of monarchs not using their first name when crowned ( e.g. 
  queen 's father ) . 
  i totally agree . 
  bremain is definitely a better solution ( mostly because it would be a strong voice for eu , which really needs those ) , but if britons want out - it should n't be a nice breakout . 
  let them feel all the consequences . 
  and if scotland want independence , eu should support it ( with providing easy way to apply , so it would be a member before uk leaves - remember , that brexit would happen only in two-three years , not immediately after tomorrow ) . 
   because if arabs would crash a plane into the palace of culture & science everyone would thank them for it . 
  some engineers after 9/11 commented , that if such attack was done against pcs , not much would happen . 
  i mean , it would n't fall , too sturdy . 
  actually i prefer palace to be just painted clean white . 
  now , it looks just dirty . 
  nope , russians built it for us . 
  and it 's exactly like russia itself - impossible to remove . 
  on the other hand , view from top is amazing . 
  exactly , i do n't think it could change mind of somebody already stuck on brexit ... but might push few people not sure about their decision , or on voting at all . 
  and it looks quite good ( i mean flag on palace ) . 
  it is [ palace of culture & science ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_culture_and_science ) , tallest building in poland , and of top 10 tallest in eu , considered one of warsaw symbols ( albeit at the same time reminder of communist period , as it was actually a. . . gift from stalin ) .

   the uk finds what uk ? 
  brexit would mean late scottish referendum result is made void . 
  whole deal with scotland remaining in uk , was that it 's more safe to remain in uk ** itself remaining ** in eu , than risk leaving uk and re-applying to eu . 
  if brexit happen , scotland would ** have to ** declare independence to stay in eu , preferably with chance to end applying process before uk leaves ( which would happen no earlier than 2018 ) . 
   however i dunno where i got these associations from football hooligans ? 
  ** are ** . 
  i entirely agree , this stereotype is outdated now . 
  but things were different ~ 20 years ago . 
  we poles . 
  i did n't mean myself or anybody here personally . 
  ok , here you really overthink it . 
  why so serious ? 
   how many german supermarkets are there in poland ? 
  lidl , aldi , auchan - not paying taxes . 
  how many factories ? 
  and how many polish factories were closed ? 
  auchan is french ... also , biggest supermarket chains in poland are tesco ( british ) , and biedronka ( portuguese ) . 
  i agree , lidl is expanding quickly . 
  aldi - never have seen it here - seems to be regional ? 
  my point - there is lots of non-german western business in poland , so why only they get the blame ? 
  nevertheless , that 's how global economy works . 
  it 's not really different elsewhere . 
   i do n't know about you but i 've never stolen a car in my life . 
  i do n't even drive  but i have seen ex-stolen cars 15-20 years ago . 
  never mind - that 's how stereotypes work . 
  whole group get blame because of visible minority . 
   these housewives do vote , right ? 
  i meant content , there is no politics inside . 
  these are weeklies with `` stories from life '' , cooking recipes , various advices ( health , beauty , fashion , children care , and so on ) , some gossip etc. 
   germans did they part of stealing and plundering on polish soil , shall poles start analogical vilifying media campaign against them ? 
  point is ... we still do that . 
  we get offended when germans joke about our car thieves or * polnische wirtschaft * , but do we avoid making jokes comparing them to teutons , nazis , or calling their women ugly ? 
  talk about double standards . 
  if a friend is worried about your health , would n't you let him know and reassure about it ? 
   during these 25 years germans managed to shift the blame on the holocaust for the poles ( when the us president mentions `` polish death camps '' you know you 've lost ) not really . 
  problem with blaming poles for holocaust is rather connected to prejudices of some american jewish groups ( like infamous anti defamation league ) , than germans . 
   bought 80 % of our media which has no real political influence . 
  this `` 80 % '' means mostly housewife , gossip or thematic ( like gardening , architecture , cars etc. ), 
  press , regional dailies , and only one of tabloids and one of weeklies . 
  major polish newspapers , both daily and weekly , are polish-owned . 
  two major private tv channels are either polish ( polsat ) or american ( tvn ) . 
   perpetuated the car thieving stereotype yeah , let 's be offended for decades because of stupid jokes , which - let 's be sincere - ** had ** some truth in them . 
  does it mean we are ned flanders of europville ?
