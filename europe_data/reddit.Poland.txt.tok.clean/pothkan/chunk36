  where was i apologetic ? 
  do you even know what does that word mean ? 
  you mistake pity with empathy , and pride with power . 
  dignity , sovereignty , nation - these are all items from two centuries ago . 
  we should know better . 
  i prefer to have friends . 
   that the polish people fell so hard for pis and all their anti-german sentiments not all of us . 
  we will get better again . 
   i guess you mean the uk ? 
  no , i mean england . 
  if brexit happen , there will be no uk in few years . 
  exactly . 
  crawl to canossa , kiss the ring and repent . 
  germany . 
  but i might be not in majority here in poland . 
  but alpine or palestine front would . 
  first , there are still many seasonal workers , coming and returning for few months . 
  second , many have families in poland , whom they send money to . 
  third , if they return in massive number , unemployment & social expences would rise here . 
  generally - most poles in uk still have strong ties with poland . 
  it 's not the case of polish-americans , who really are out of touch . 
  high-tech , finances , some of factories ? 
  yeah . 
  but services , restaurants , hotels - i do n't think so . 
  but not comparable payment in the same job . 
  and there is lots of poles in ireland . 
  would there be enough jobs left to acommodate those now in uk ? 
  but lots ( most ? ), 
  of poles working in uk come from cities like \u0141om\u017ca . 
   they would likely provide much more if they 'd stay in country . 
  so you assume 20-30-something from \u0141om\u017ca or radom would have a better paying job there , than in uk ? 
  i doubt if he/she would have a job at all . 
  you 're already using poles for that . 
   would n't a lot of them move to another eu country ? 
  language is a serious factor . 
  many poles ( majority among younger ) know at least decent english , even just because it 's taught at schools , and of course there is strong exposition with movies , tv series etc. 
  french , german - not so much . 
   but is sure is responsible for letting them into the eu/euro it was greece who falsified statistics itself . 
  built a wall on south border first . 
  then - welcome !, 
  no way , he 's ukrainian not hungarian . 
   eurosceptics love pushing the idea that turkey will join in the close future . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't think there is possibility of turkey joining , ** ever ** . 
  although i think close association ( something like norway ) could be a good idea . 
  i mean , turkey being a voluntary member of eea , but without a political vote or schengen ( but of course no visa for turkish citizens required ) . 
   they 've just got better elites that more often know when to push the buttons and in which direction . 
  and this is a situation where elites failed . 
  why there is a referendum at first place ? 
  because cameron wanted to strengthen his position , being sure `` remain '' will win . 
  why is johnson pro-brexit ? 
  because it could get him 10 downing street . 
  they were n't thinking about long term consequences , just about their own careers . 
   scexit post-brexit feels like a worst case scenario for everyone . 
  imho post-brexit independent scotland ( remaining in eu ) would be more relevant , than independent scotland with england still in eu . 
   and when we come crawling back ? 
  please veto us . 
  i would gladly accept england back . 
  but without any special opt-outs . 
   but why do germans very strongly like putin ( 14 % ) more then czechia ( 12 % ) is beyond me . 
  they export more to us then to whole russia . 
  it might be because of lower relevancy . 
  only support percentages are shown , i suppose czechia got more `` do n't know '' or `` do n't care '' responses than russia . 
  but `` against '' attitude might be actually lower . 
  cyclist = poland . 
   there are not really right wing they are in polish meaning . 
  our left/right division is more about worldview and rhetorics than economy or finances . 
   to be fair , i think most national currencies are prettier than the euro . 
  dollars or yens are very boring , even more than euros . 
  actually , very often exotic ( and often crappy in value ) currencies look best . 
  of course , there are exceptions from both sides . 
  and 100 years later austrians participated in partitions of poland . 
  seriously , i think we would end better letting ottomans take vienna then . 
  how do you even reproduce ? 
  actually , russian tourists in poland or lithuania ( ** except ** the cigarettes ) . 
   ireland : when i was in dublin for few months , i had problems with coming back to my place of stay in the beginning . 
  everything looked the same . 
  or polish tourist in russia ( only about cigarettes though , food is more expensive there ) . 
   apart from the uk . 
  we 're an island so all your continentals better stay away because we 're special / s too late . 
   something like this is common too , mostly closer to the city centre from what i 've seen . 
  it looks extremely similar to some areas in our ( poland ) cities . 
  probably because trees .

  such words coming from albanian ? 
  it should hurt . 
  no offense , i 'm sure you 've came a long road since 1997 . 
   would estonia abandon its independence aspirations in 1991 if most of the world refused to recognize it ? 
  i doubt it . 
  estonia was already independent , in 1991 they only ** get it back ** . 
  sooo ... in basic transnistria is arstotzka , but for real ? 
  such things happen . 
  look ireland of course , where there are two major parties coming from one core . 
  tbh , i think that even inside po there 's no agreement about their ideological stance . 
  it 's very watered down and rather heterogenous party , mostly thanks to tusk 's `` warm tap water '' policy . 
  po definitely is moderate and conservative , that 's why `` centre-right '' . 
  and without doubt they are pro-eu . 
  economically , i would say they were pragmatist / going with the flow . 
  they were n't really reforming anything , but at least cared about stability .
