  so , still ... it could be worse than them . 
   that 's what many poles like after seeing the effects of mass migration in other countries . 
  seeing ? 
  you mean hearing about it in the media ? 
   they want their countries for themselves so in short , nationalism/xenophoby . 
   just to add to this , that 's also how they can get away with messing with the constitutional court . 
  yeah . 
  scaremongering = `` deliberate use of fear based tactics including ** exaggeration ** and usually ** repetition ** to influence the public '' . 
   there are demonstrations by kod , who are backed by the opposition , but every time they do it there 's a counter-demonstration aswell few thousand far-right-wingers against ~ 100k kod . 
  you call that counter-demonstration ? 
  i 'm laughing right now . 
  in short : scaremongering . 
   well , in finland 40 % would not know who the leader of the central bank is you use euro however , so central bank is not really relevant . 
   read on to find out why : so in basic , you just want to [ live in interesting times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_you_live_in_interesting_times ) . 
  in poland left/right division means more about ** world view ** issues , than stance on economy and state . 
  if we 'd apply your understanding , yes , . n would be centre-right , but then pis would be left-wing . 
   thats an `` ideology '' for in-the-closet right-wing people that want to feel good about themselves by caring about gays , a minimum wage and free weed lol i meant ** european ** ( original ) definition of social liberalism , not american . 
   which is a center-right party they are more left then right , e.g. 
  pro same-sex unions , pro in-vitro , against religion in school . 
   that they are a neoliberal party ? 
  . n is just liberal , even more social-liberal ( slightly ) than neo . 
  generally , it 's a radical moderate party . 
  that 's why just centre , not centre-something . 
  have you ever heard about social liberalism ? 
   the `` centre-left '' `` socially liberal '' newspaper polityka just posted the ( example ) data . 
  research was made isp pan : http://isppan.waw.pl/pgsw/, 
   my wife is an oncologist and showed me the paper . 
  i 'll have to see if she paid for it or if it 's free . 
  she should n't even have to pay for such data . 
  thankfully , there 's libgen , 
   they lowered the retirement age because 2 years earlier po raised it . 
  they wanted to revert that change and did so . 
  they did n't yet . 
  i 'm guessing , parliament or president . 
  or just `` i do n't know '' . 
  wiktionary : https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/bankier - `` owner or chairman of a bank '' . 
  and that 's why we have no alternative , than vote `` lesser evils '' . 
  ladies and gentlemen , we have an [ alpha male ] ( http://i1.memy.pl/obrazki/1b63799236_panie_i_panowie.jpg ) here . 
  please be careful around him . 
  they all work for a banker . 
  like economist in a bank . 
  working for somebody do n't make you them . 
  wow . 
  what about security guards working in a bank ? 
  it specialists ? 
  secretaries ? 
  are they bankers as well ? 
   so is there just no party for the rational voter at present ? 
  you have to decide who to believe here . 
   i guess it 's dangerous to intervene in an anti-pis circlejerk ? 
  no , you get my upvote . 
  although what you said can be contradicted - e.g. 
  competence of voters usually related to competence of politicians . 
  what i mean , party basing on less-educated would be probably less competent itself . 
  and of course , sweden is a specific example . 
  i 'm not ever talking about 20th century native socialist model , but also previous history . 
  for example , we ca n't underestimate fact , that it was always quite equal society , e.g. 
  there was no serfdom . 
  also , competence of voters is probably strongly related to duration of democratic system . 
  poland is democratic since 27 years , and was for only 6-7 before the ww ii . 
  sweden is democratic for how long ? 
   is a most famous banker in poland . 
  he 's an economist , not banker . 
  he never chaired any bank . 
  do n't bother . 
  korwinists are waterproof . 
   the reason why he got so low is because most people do n't bother looking up the reason is that most people do n't want to get in tremendous debt because of serious illness , or sending children into good high schools . 
  not everybody is a gifted chemistry teacher . 
  you 're stuck in pre-bismarck capitalism . 
  exactly . 
   more like `` considering themselves smart '' i would rather say `` considering themselves better than other people '' . 
  not stupid , but big jerks . 
   the next thing they want is power . 
  that 's how politics is working . 
   those junkie ones and atfer a secondary education - yes that 's why i said `` mostly '' . 
  of course , still many youngsters voted by korwin , but its core support is rather in 30-40 bracket . 
  yeah , but there is some comparison . 
  on the other hand , lung cancer is much better researched , than skin cancers . 
  exactly . 
  power should be moved from council to ep & commission . 
   melanoma killed my father and i 've read too much about it because the amount of pain he went through scares me to this day . 
  mine too , that 's why i 'm supersensitive about it . 
  however , while most of cancers are hereditary , there 's often an additional , environmental factor . 
  those two added together form serious risk . 
  still , we 've traveled far from original topic . 
   thier multi milionaire head of the party first , having ~ 3m pln is n't exactly being `` multi milionaire '' . 
  there are much richer politicians than him , e.g. 
  pis senator bierecki has over 12m . 
  kukiz has ~ 2m , some pis mps have 4-5m ( e.g. 
  richest one , jakubiak from kukiz '15 ( owner of successful brewery ) has nearly 70m . 
  second , at least we can know petru is n't joining politics for money . 
   i 'd rather say they are anti social and without knowledge of any basic things . 
  they were at least campaigning with a calculator in hand . 
   their leader convinced poles to get credit in swiss franks it was few years ago , when he was a financial consultant , not politician . 
  and nearly everybody recommended swiss franc credits then , including pis . 
   korwin votes were also mostly from college students and other people of newest generation . 
  not exactly . 
  youngsters mostly moved to kukiz . 
  however , many korwin voters are successful , although minor businessmen . 
  in general , this group opposes `` european '' social solidarity , prefering `` american '' ( republican ) * everyone for themselves * mentality , with very low taxes , small state ( with healthcare or education paid privately ) , and minimal social welfare .
