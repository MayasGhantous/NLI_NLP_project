  they are also big supporters of loose gun control . 
  so in short , it 's party of smart & heartless . 
  they 're mostly supporters of status quo in such questions like abortion , role of church , same-sex unions etc. 
  it slightly changed during last year , when kopacz pretended to support some changes , trying to get centre-left voters . 
  it did n't worked , and actually probably discouraged po centre-right core . 
  of course , there are some progressive politicians in po ( it 's not an uniform party ) , but they are minority . 
  you can get lung cancer not smoking cigarettes . 
  but risk is much lower . 
  i mean if she does n't get enough sun to fill her vitamine d needs , it probably means she does n't get it enough to create melanoma . 
   they 'll say it started when the eu started to force our countries to take in `` refugees '' it is matter of solidarity . 
  not with refugees themselves , but countries struggling at the frontline . 
  italy , greece , bulgaria , etc. 
  i understand one could not care about syrians , but we should help our european friends . 
  you mean there 's sun working indoors ? 
   or she will because her skin is n't used to the sun . 
  that 's the point . 
  she does n't show it to the sun . 
  on the other hand , she probably wo n't get skin cancer ... 
   will nowoczesna be able to find popular mainstream support ? 
  doubtly , imho support in present polls ( ~ 20 % ) is maximum . 
  and i 'm saying that being their voter . 
  however , if there will be an anti-pis coalition during next elections , probably with kod blessing ( . n + po + lewica ) , . n could be a major power there . 
  and btw , such coalition is imho an only real way to oust pis , because let 's be sincere - they have strong hard core support , which probably wo n't fall under 25 % ( unless pis collapses itself , which could happen only after death of kaczy\u0144ski ) . 
  so if opposition is divided between different parties , coalition is needed to gain more seats ( we have voting system heavily awarding winning list ) . 
  there 's other problem - eu is struggling now , with whole refugee crisis , brexit , still not resolved greece , rise of right-wing populists ... and we 're not helping here , actually contrary - pis is helping to undermine eu . 
  simple answer : government . 
  answers to three questions , checking basic knowledge about the state operation . 
  i translated the chart into english , leaving original on the right . 
  feel free to post similar charts from your countries !, 
  parties ( electorates ) mentioned : * [ korwin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_for_the_renewal_of_the_republic%e2%80%93liberty_and_hope ) - right-libertarian , eurosceptic ( pro-polexit ) , strongly [ leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke ) - orientated ; 4.8 % in last elections ( under the 5 % threshold ) ; * [ kukiz ' 15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukiz%2715 ) - right-wing , populist , anti-establishment , big tent including far right groups , strongly [ leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pawe%c5%82_kukiz ) - orientated , eurosceptic , xenophobic ; 8.8 % , 42 seats , 8-12 % in late polls ; in opposition both to pis & kod , but rather leaning towards pis ; * [ nowoczesna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_%28political_party%29 ) ( `` modern '' ) - new centre-liberal party , strongly pro-eu ; 7.6 % , 28 seats , 18-22 % in late polls ; supports kod ; * [ pis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice ) ( `` law & justice '' ) - national conservative , populist , protectionist , eurosceptic ( against political integration ) , backed by church ; won with 38 % , gained 235 seats , formed individual majority government ; 30-38 % in late polls ; * [ po ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_platform ) ( `` civic platform '' ) - centre-right , liberal conservative , pro-eu ; 24 % , 138 seats , 12-18 % in late polls ; formed government with psl 2007-2015 ; supports kod ; * [ psl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people%27s_party ) - centre right , conservative , representing farmers , strong base in local govts in rural areas , considered to be corrupt & nepothist ( but on the other hand , quite democratic internally , compared to other parties ) ; 5.1 % , 16 seats ; minor member of ruling coalition 2007-15 ; supports kod ; * [ razem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razem ) ( `` together '' ) - new left-wing party , progressive , anti-austerity , precariate - roughly polish * podemos * ; 3.6 % ( no seats , under threshold ) ; anti-pis , but protesting on their own , not with kod ; * [ zjednoczona lewica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_left_ ( poland ) ) ( `` united left '' ) - electoral alliance of centre-left parties , including post-communist sld ; 7.6 % ( no seats , under the 8 % coalition threshold ) ; mostly supports kod ; ps . 
  [ kod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/committee_for_the_defence_of_democracy ) ( committee for the defence of democracy ) - big tent civic organization formed after the elections , supported by some of parties mentioned above ;, 
  you have no idea how migrant crisis and muslim problem is blown out of proportion here . 
   and the price to pay was to `` just '' slip behind the top three economies in europe , in the grand scheme of things that 's nothing . 
  that 's the problem . 
  yeah , i 'm still hopeful we will be able to oust pis during next elections ( 2019 ) . 
  but what will be the damages ? 
  we worked hard for 15-20 years to built strong economy and get closer to western standard of living & service . 
  how much of that we 'll have to make up , repeat ? 
  if pis managed to break mess so much with state and democracy ( where one can see results quite quickly ) , how much will they mess finances ( where results are visible after some time ) ? 
   the schools , offices , courts and administration were subsequently germanised / russyfied , especially after constant rebellions and uprisings . 
  it slightly changed after 1905-06 revolution , when polish-language schools were allowed in `` congress kingdom '' , and polish press received more freedom . 
  in general , worst period was ca.1880-1900 . 
  it 's called `` apukhtin night '' in polish history , after russian [ superintendent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_apukthin ) of schools in congress kingdom . 
  however , russification by the vistula proved to be shallow and reversible . 
   to my knowledge , in poland , you guys also had forced russianization to the point that one could go to jail for speaking polish . 
  not really . 
  of course , russian was forced as main language in 1939-41 period , but there was polish-language press , theatres etc. 
  ( of course with heavily communist propaganda content ) , and speaking polish on daily basis , etc. 
  in street was n't prosecuted . 
  on the other hand , polish was banned in territories annected to german reich , especially eastern pommerania and upper silesia . 
  polish citizens , not people . 
  while poles were majority among deported , it included also jews , ukrainians ( in this order ) and other nationalities . 
  soviet deportations from eastern poland in 1939-41 numbered 700-800 ,000 * people ( ~ 5-6 % of total population ) , ~ 65 % of them were poles ( ~ 15 % of polish population there ) . 
  * `` over 1,200,000 '' mentioned above is now considered ( based on [ ipn research ] ( https://ipn.poczytaj.pl/151893 ) ) to be an overestimation . 
   right now i ca n't find any politician that deserves a vote , they are all silly and unreasonable then try to choose lesser evil . 
  [ poland ] ( http://ezakupy.tesco.pl/pl-pl/productdetail/productdetail/2003009824750 ) . 
  and basing on op 's comment , that 's probably same jars in morocco . 
   why do you think they want a conflict ? 
  what is their reasoning ( if there is any ) ? 
  mobilization of core support , heating up the atmosphere . 
  but sincerely - i think they just ca n't work different , they are unable to compromise . 
  it 's `` all or nothing '' mentality . 
   yes , you 're right , the polish government is way more clumsy than orb\u00e1n . 
  if they were clever ( of course i 'm happy they are n't ) , they would just wait until the end of year , when present ct president is stepping down , and then install their puppet . 
  but they want ** conflict ** . 
   the current goverment has been chosen in a democratic way it has n't received enough support to change constitution . 
  so they are trying to work around it . 
  that 's the problem . 
   poland may be doing some stupid shit but at least you guys seem to have a spine . 
  especially when we are licking shoes of clergy . 
   i 'm also not aware that we or poland protected hungary on the eu level actually previous ( po ) government was quite cozy with orban . 
  say what you want , but he 's quite skillful player in diplomacy game . 
  while pis is doing everything possible to alienate everybody . 
   we 're literally becoming a ~ ~ rogue ~ ~ moron state . 
  ftfy . 
   but it 's now been 6 years since orb\u00e1n got in power in hungary . 
  it also does n't look like his position is weakening at all . 
  orban has much bigger voters ' support than pis ( roughly double ) . 
  and still , he acts more cautiously . 
  he 's been backing sometimes , even if it was just a `` two steps forward , one step back '' move . 
  notice , that fidesz still is a member of epp . 
  pis essentially tries to change more in half-year , than orban in six years , despite the smaller credentials . 
  and they 're still pushing , \u043d\u0438 \u0448\u0430\u0433\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 . 
   your country does n't have some fundamental internal conflict that can be used to manipulate the population but there is an external issue which can be - and is - used with this purpose : muslim migrants . 
  plain old scaremongering . 
   in video he earned 2400 pnl and minimum wage is like 1600-1700 professional shipyard workers earn much more than minimum wage . 
  crist would have to pay 3000 + to pole in the same position . 
  what about kirovohrad ? 
   queen empress . 
   funny how a bomb attack happens for the first time in decades here there were some bomb attacks by anticommunist opposition during the prl period , but without casualties ( e.g. 
  opole 1971 - it was planned to kill policemen , but exploded prematurely during the night ) . 
  and in 1990s-2000s there was a wave of crime-related bomb assassinations . 
   but this is just a public bus with random people . . unstable construction , premature explosion . 
   how there were n't if i just gave you at least three examples ? 
  and i explained why neither could pass . 
  but who knows , may be this one wo n't as well ? 
  we shall see . 
   their idea was to bring it on , oppose it and fight pis on this issue to avoid other subjects , but it did n't worked . 
  it did n't work , because it was ** too late ** . 
  it might work earlier in 2015 , at least few months before president elections , but after that ?
