  it was a clear desperation . 
  they had eight years to bring it . 
  same about civil unions . 
  also , remember that po is also a conservative party ( psl even more ) , and many of its politicians support present law . 
  if kopacz would try to pass progressive law early in 2015 , she would lose some mps . 
  and she was barely handling po even without that . 
   they get that mythical electorate , but it seems that 's very little . 
  only reason why some of left electorate still stayed with po , was that voting lewica would mean voting sld & miller . 
  plus that nobody expected success of razem . 
  and of course , while nobody expected po to change anything about abortion etc. , they at least guaranteed * status quo * . 
  while pis = change for worse . 
  still , there were even some lbgt activists ( e.g. 
  krystian legierski ) , who were so pissed by po , that they eventually voted for pis ... kind of hillarious , actually . 
   that nobody was touching this question before and it 's because of this party . 
  there were no real attempts in parliament . 
  it was either voting with expected , sure result ( rejection ) , or debating just before elections . 
  but now it 's different . 
  if kaczy\u0144ski tries to reject this change , it would end in jurek case again . 
  and pis ca n't afford that now , they have too narrow margin of majority . 
   right before elections allowed a pro choice project to be debated in patliament they fooled nobody . 
  it was clear , that they did only to get voices of left , because it would n't be passed before elections . 
  and if they won , it would be back in fridge . 
   so what about now ? 
  is that project of `` non political '' ngo even passed to parliament ? 
  present pis is very different from 2007 pis , when lech kaczy\u0144ski and his wife were alive ( remember , that she was a staunch supporter of present law ) . 
   everybody wanted to `` touch '' this law from time to time but no government dared to . 
  not even sld . 
  generally , after it was introduced , only non-political sides ( both pro-lifers and pro-choicers ) wanted to change it . 
  all major ( parliamentary ) parties agreed to not touch it . 
  until now . 
   first of all , how do you know i 'm not ? 
  i assumed based on your nick . 
  sorry if i 'm wrong . 
   secondly about a half of aborted humans are females fetuses are n't humans ** yet ** ( until circa 18th week ) . 
  that 's the point . 
  most countries do n't permit abortion ** after ** that moment , because yeah , then it would be a murder . 
   and finally , what 's wrong with you people that you have to inslut and censor the others ? 
  what 's wrong with you , with all your bans and restrictions ? 
  i 'm not forcing any woman to undertake an abortion . 
   the current law is not so bad it is already bad . 
  but you know what ? 
  i think that this call on further restriction could work for better . 
  why ? 
  because present law is considered a `` compromise '' , and that 's why nobody wanted to touch it for over a decade . 
  if pis will change present law for a new , more strict , next government would be free to introduce law more progressive than present one . 
   why ? 
  because you are not a woman . 
  do n't have an uterus ? 
  do n't talk about abortion . 
  period . 
  if you do , you are just a mysogyne . 
  `` fun '' fact : muslims believe , that * fetus is believed to become a living soul after [ four months ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_and_abortion#before_four_months_of_gestation ) of gestation * , so abortion is permitted before that moment ( after - only if woman 's life is in danger ) . 
  according to catholic church , fetus becomes a living being before it 's even a fetus , at the moment of impregnation . 
  it 's legal to abort in 2nd-3rd month in many muslim countries ** no matter what ** , while in poland it 's permitted only if woman was raped ( it 's the same in other muslim countries , e.g. 
  iran ) , and would be entirely banned if proposed law is passed . 
  that 's why poles do n't want muslims - they would be a competition . 
  we have our own talibs . 
   current government prepared such controversial discussion topic to dilute the discussion in other aspects . 
  not exactly . 
  abortion ban is backed by pro-life groups , church and some parts of ruling party , but actually governments looks a little uneasy here . 
  not because duda , szyd\u0142o or ( last but not least ) kaczy\u0144ski do n't want to back it , but because they have enough of opened fronts already . 
  anti-vaxxers become big problem in poland as well . 
  do n't know ; 2 . 
  yeah . 
  so from albanian bunkers we reached swedish english-language song about polish defence against germans . 
  this subreddit in a nutshell . 
  nope , sorbian , kashubian and upper silesian are missing . 
  although there might be no quality rap in these languages ( but i 'm not an expert ) . 
  and belarusian ones seem to be sung in russian or rather * trasyanka * , not `` pure '' belarusian ( of course i might be wrong here ) . 
  poland - [ \u0141ona & webber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ivzfirsve ) definitely should be included . 
   the fisher boats in the harbor of kobe used hiragana and alfabet when i went shopping there last week it further proves a point , that there 's no clear rules . 
   i do n't want to offend any poles but imo the way you write in latin really shows it does n't really fit the language . 
  tradition . 
  look at english we all use here - there 's lots of words , which have no logic when spoken . 
  tomb , bomb , comb , womb - every of those has different sound in place of ` o ' . 
  it depends . 
  it 's definitely well suited to russian because of its wide use of `` soft '' vowels , but western & southern slavic languages can work with latin well . 
  even belarussian & ukrainian have its own latin alphabets ( first not widely used , second very rare & `` eccentric '' ) , which look quite practical . 
  still , it 's more about tradition & history than practicality . 
  and actually russian alphabet has its flaws , like occasional breaking of `` speak how you write '' rule , even for vowels ( e.g. 
  - ava for - \u043e\u0433\u043e or a - for o - ) , while in western/slavic it 's never or consonants-only ( e.g. 
  in polish hard ones are often softened in speech , if placed near other soft ones ) . 
   katakana : only for loanwords and foreign names . 
  not only . 
  it 's also used for japanese names , when written on ships ( because it 's more distinguishable than hiragana ) , even during ww 2 ( especially in ijn destroyers ) . 
   does n't japanese also have that ? 
  kanji and hiragana ? 
  it 's not similar . 
  latin/cyrillic script in serbian is mutually exclusive , ( you use either one or another , unless forced to ) , while japanese can use all three scripts even in single sequence ( kanji for nouns , verbs etc. 
  ; hiragana for pronouns etc. 
  ; katakana for loanwords ) , sometimes even with addition of latin alphabet ( e.g. 
  foreign acronyms , like fbi or uefa ) , and of course western ( arabic ) numerals . 
   ( katakana is n't usually used except for foreign names ) and loanwords , which are plenty of in modern japanese . 
  distant example : both words have its derivatives even in polish ( being on the other side of slavic family , and not really interintelligible with croatian/serbian ) . 
  \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0443\u0445\u044a -  wzdycha\u0107 ( to sigh imperfect ) , wzdech ( inhalation , breath-in ) ; \ua641\u043e\u0440\u043a\u044a -  zerka\u0107 ( to peek ) . 
  also \u0434\u043e\u0443\u0445\u044a -  duch ( ghost , spirit ) , oddech ( breath ) , dusza ( soul ) . 
   it was n't a concidence that the subreddit dedicated to soft national stereotyping was named r/polandball according to wikipedia :  polandball has its roots in an august 2009 `` cyberwar '' between polish internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com . 
  the website , which offers a virtual canvas , allows internet users to draw whatever they want , and to draw over others ' drawings . 
  on the internet in poland , an idea was raised to draw the polish flag on the ball , and thousands of poles together managed to take over the drawball with a painting of white on top of red , with the word `` polska '' written in the middle . 
  so in short , it started because of poles showing off for no significant reason .
