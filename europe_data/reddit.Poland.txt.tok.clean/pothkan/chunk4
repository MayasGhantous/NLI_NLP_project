  no , mostly low gun ownership . 
   well , urban planning is almost non-existent in polish cities yeah ... it 's one of few factors , where communist period was better . 
  they had actually very good urban planning . 
  i live in early 1980s housing , and generally like it - sensible gaps between buildings , lots of green ; planned & built infrastructure ( like schools , market etc. 
  ) ; good commuting ( bus etc. 
   i 'm really not sure that 's true . 
  it might be not true just about you . 
   i mean , any hate for outsiders seems like an abstract thing . 
  one might hold some unfavorable stereotypes ... 
  compare our massive * islamophobia * ( let 's put aside whether it 's a good or bad thing ) with number of muslims in poland . 
  let 's be sincere , we hate each other ** less ** than we hate foreigners . 
  actually , on contrary , poland is rather safe , with very low rate of murders , and low of robberies . 
  major exception are car accidents , mostly due to our bad driving culture . 
  gated communities are rather an example of many poles being suspicious and distrustful to other kinsmen ( not even talking about foreigners ) . 
  even on private ( single ) properties you would often notice high fences or hedges . 
  poster above talked about `` elite thinkers '' , not average politicians . 
  neither he is an isolationist . 
  i would say that both ( obama and clinton ) are generally appeasers , albeit of course hillary is a hawk-ish one . 
  so yeah , imho she would more or less continue obama 's foreign policy ( dunno about other fields , but it 's less important from our pov ) . 
  trump would be definitely a worst case scenario . 
  free world still needs america , despite of all their flaws . 
  that 's the problem . 
  pis way of thinking is n't `` we are asking '' ( supplicant ) , it 's `` we are entitled '' ( victim ) . 
   considering clinton 's investment in conflicts in the middle east and africa i would n't call her isolationists . 
  neither did i. i said that trump is one . 
  there is no `` republican '' or `` democrat '' foreign policy . 
  both parties have groups and politicians supporting different stances : isolationists , hawks , appeasers et caetera . 
   piss off basically all of the eu ( minus hungary ) i still think that orban is actually using us , like `` you see eu , we [ hungary ] are not so bad '' . 
  yes , because of course average joe knows better . 
  not so funny if watched from inside poland . 
   considering the various countries that happen to be american allies throughout the world it was a thing during the cold war , when us supported some very nasty guys all over the world , but rather changed after 1989 . 
  now unless you have a really strong geographic , military or resources card ( like turkey , egypt or saudi arabia ) , you pretty much should stay a liberal democracy . 
  not doing it might not mean a lack of support ... but definitely at least a cold shoulder . 
   just wait another year until obama is out of office . 
  regardless of who gets elected ( trump , cruz or hilary ) the us will be willing to lease at least a token airbase in poland . 
  not a chance . 
  clinton would probably continue obama 's foreign policy , and trump is an isolationist , and would be eager to deal with putin . 
   sikorski , was a pis politician . 
  he was never a member of pis . 
  he was a minister in first pis-lead government . 
  along with some other sensible people , like religa or meller . 
   as a ~ ~ lechia ~ ~ arka fixed . 
   was n't poland the last country in europe to execute a man for atheism as recent as 130 years ago ? 
  no , it happened [ 200 hundred years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazimierz_%c5%81yszczy%c5%84ski ) earlier . 
   one of the last lynchings for witchcraft was also poland ~ 180 years ago . 
  it was part of prussia then . 
   something like joining eu one thousand years later  exactly . 
  sticking to paganism then would be like staying out of eu now . 
  look like it ended for polabians ( with our shameful help ) . 
   a main source of incoming is publishing and charging for these scientific papers . 
  paper = usually a text ( article ) in scientific journal , post-symposium publication , etc. 
   so even if the book barely sells , the publishing houses really do n't make a loss on it . 
  and prices are horrendous . 
  routledge publisher . 
  50-60 pounds for a 250-300 pages paperback ? 
  seriously ? 
   they did n't even last 2 last time lol they did n't have individual majority then . 
   just please do n't go full pis ;-) only 3,5 years more . 
  please wait . 
   if it had more power it would become oligarchy , if it 's not already that . 
  that 's why with more power should go more democracy . 
  direct election of commission president ( it 's just an example ) , with different candidates ( epp , pasd etc. ), 
  proposing different supranational platforms . 
   there are pizzarias in denmark , mostly western denmark , which serve pizzas with b\u00e9arnaise sauce on them . 
  sometimes i seriously think you danes try to topple english cuisine from the `` worst one '' throne . 
   as for topping i got no idea which one would be a typically polish judging on popularity : ** hawajska ** ( hawaii ) , with pineapple ( hate it ) & tuna/ham , sometimes also maize . 
  and essential garlic sauce ( hate it ) , and on thick crust ( hate it ) . 
  seriously , it 's everywhere . 
  however , if you think `` local '' pizza , it would probably involve kabanos & pickled cucumbers . 
  and yeah , garlic sauce . 
  somebody else could read that and learn something . 
  little strokes fell great oaks . 
  at least here we can agree . 
  by the way , that 's probably why this idea is proposed by kukiz . 
  he clearly knows , that it ca n't be done , so is using it for gaining support via `` compromise stance '' . 
  so gossip / homewomen 's media ( tips , recipes etc. 
  ) , telecasts , and bunch of local/regional dailies . 
  you seriously mean that * gazeta lubuska * , * z \u017cycia wzi\u0119te * , * na \u017cywo * or * tele \u015awiat * are influential on political opinions of poles ? 
  here are similar outlines of [ tv stations , national newspaper and weeklies ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/h/74/art377930.jpg ) . 
  what is ( partially ) german-owned : major tabloid , one of major radio stations , and one of major weeklies . 
  except last one ( * newsweek * ) neither of those is known for strongly anti-pis stance . 
   what vast majority of german media in poland say . 
  major anti-pis media are : daily newspaper * gazeta wyborcza * ( polish owned , own company ) , weekly * polityka * ( polish , self-owned cooperative ) and television tvn ( controlled by american scripps networks interactive ) . 
  so where are your `` germans '' ? 
  it 's not international , it 's eu . 
   let 's check : before the elections , the tvp broadcaster was a propaganda tube for the old po government . 
  after the elections , the tvp broadcaster was turned into the propaganda tube for new pis government . 
  indeed , the difference is staggering . 
  but po did n't fire tvp journalists because of political reasons before ( sometimes they moved them to different , less prominent departments , but still on tvp payroll ) . 
  now pis openly fires many tvp journalists . 
  but previously it was at least more or less pluralist . 
  jan po\u015bpieszalski ( a major pro-pis publicist ) had his talk-show through whole po rule ( albeit it was moved in 2011 to tvp info ) . 
  while now tvp agenda is purely pro-government . 
   all i can see is the eu meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign nation . 
  all i can see is the eu worrying abouut the domestic affairs of its member nation . 
   no human right or democracy has been violated separation of powers , which is one of foundations of democracy , was and is violated . 
   how on earth is fidesz still hanging in there ? 
  diplomacy . 
  contrary to kaczy\u0144ski , orban knows how to appease opponents with small concessions . 
   it is body that used to have mostly judges coming from opposing party .
