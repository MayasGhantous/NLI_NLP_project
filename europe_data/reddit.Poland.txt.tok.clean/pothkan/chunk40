  being mocked is one thing , but here we actually have put up to mockery . 
  but i 'm actually glad about polandball being named for poland . 
  more relevancy !, 
  and of course , it 's most often really funny ( at least on subreddit , ca n't say that about some other webpages ) . 
   it 's hardly surprising ptsd should be treated , not used as an excuse . 
   i 've just heard a lot of bad things from black people visiting/living there . 
  black people are rather safe . 
  problem starts , when you 're resembling an arab ( which could include being latino or mediterranean ) . 
   according to the prosecutor 's statement . 
  that 's the problem , who we should believe here . 
   the papers which reported it did it it was first reported by local nowiny24.pl  looks like it was a part of the current internal political struggle you seriously believe ** all ** these cases were politically motivated ? 
   gosh , why do you people use dubbing ? 
  still better than voice-over . 
  which is a standard here ( is it anywhere else , except poland and russia ? 
  ) , and one of reasons why i do n't watch polish tv . 
  it 's kind of feedback loop . 
  on one hand , pis is going with the popular desire , on other it 's fueling it , and using as an internal weapon , both against opposition and eu . 
  they are sustaining `` besieged fortress '' syndrome , and exaggerating the problem to cover up everything else . 
   being drunk does n't justify it , i sometimes get drunk with good friends and it does n't make me want to beat up people . 
  exactly . 
  alcohol could make somebody losing control and attacking somebody , but not create thoughts , reasons behind it - those are already there . 
   its scary how easily people trust politicians , as long as they cater to their fears . 
  definition of scaremongering . 
   yet more problems may arise with north and sub-saharan african and middle eastern muslim refugees . 
  throwing these two groups is a mistake ( e.g. 
  syrian population is better educated and more urban , than rather rural/illiterate moroccan , algerians ) , unfortunately done very frequently . 
  cologne attacks , which were done mostly by north african ** migrants ** , not syrian refugees . 
  it 's even backed in history - french forces made of north african recruits were responsible for some nasty attacks on [ italian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marocchinate ) or german women during late ww 2 . 
   no big party supports refugees in poland . 
  but pis ( and kukiz ' 15 ) are openly ** justifying ** , encouraging , and feeding on anti-refugee sentiment . 
   also ... i do n't think it 's very effective boogeyman . 
  it was effective before and during elections . 
  of course , refugee crisis ( and agreement to take 7k ) was n't a single reason why po lost , but it was one of major ones . 
  i do n't think pis would n't win anyway , but they might not get majority then . 
  unfortunately yes . 
  such assaults ( luckily no fatalities yet , and let 's hope it stays so ) are becoming more frequent . 
  lately a portuguese student ( erasmus exchange ) in rzesz\u00f3w was attacked , because somebody took him for an arab . 
  few months ago a syrian man ( christian , living legally in poland since few years ) was beaten up in pozna\u0144 . 
  few weeks later a chilean dancing teacher was assaulted . 
  a sikh tourist in auschwitz , slapped and spat . 
  colombian student in cracow , beaten up . 
  egyptian in wroc\u0142aw ( legal stay ) , broken nose . 
  polish-angolan reggae singer in szczecin , broken jaw ( taken for syrian refugee ) . 
  yeah , most of these assaults happened late in the evening or at night , and attackers were often drunk ... but some in broad day . 
  these are just most serious examples from few months , and all this is happening before any ** actual ** refugees would come here . 
  definitely not you . 
   eu throwing 160k muslim migrants into our country ( which they wanted to do ) is something we would likely never be able to fix . 
  it would be extremely ** easy ** to fix . 
  90 % of them would move to germany , sweden etc. 
  as soon as they could . 
  first , because that 's where their families or friends already are . 
  second , because they would feel endangered in poland . 
  refugees are a boogeyman used by pis to subjugate poles . 
  that 's a dictionary example of how scaremongering works . 
  still , i think that we should help in refugee crisis , just because of european solidarity . 
  not to germany , but to countries really struggling here - greece , bulgaria , hungary , italy etc. 
  ecb board is appointed by governments of eurozone states . 
  i 'm talking about euparliament and affiliated institutions ( mainly eucommission ) . 
  yeah , traitors of sanity . 
   the loud minority traitors and because of exactly such approach streets are only solution left . 
  because government is anti-eu ( not exactly talking about polexit , but definitely pro-more loose union ; and of course very anti-refugees , although unfortunately this stance is shared by strong majority of poles = very effective scaremongering ) . 
  welcome in our alternative reality . 
   even their original name was `` center agreement '' it was always kaczy\u0144ski 's tool . 
  in the early 1990s he thought that wide centre platform would get him more votes . 
  it did n't work ( mostly because centre was taken by ud & kld then ) , so eventually he moved onto more conservative and populist stance . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  which says something about a razem , actually ( good about their integrity , not necessarily about will to work together and compromise ) . 
   so if there are anti-democratic laws , why kod can still protesting on streets ? 
  because ban or forceful dispersion would only give more support to kod . 
  even kaczy\u0144ski is n't so stupid , he knows that . 
  although some pis politicians would welcome it gladly . 
   is n't there usually another demonstration in poland that says the exact opposite what the first one says ? 
  pis was announcing a big pro-government ( anti-kod ) demonstration repeatedly few months ago . 
  i wonder why it has n't happened yet ... 
   the eu needs a good wakeup slap tbh . 
  it 's not the eu who needs a slap , but national governments . 
   pis did not win by having big support , they won due to weakness of the rest of the political scene . 
  pis won because big number of votes ( 16 % ) was left under threshold ( lewica , korwin , razem ) . 
  that 's why they won majority of seats with only 38 % of votes . 
  po had more votes both in 2007 and 2011 ( as well as sld in 2001 ) , but due to different distribution they all had to form coalition with smaller parties ( actually the same one - psl ) . 
   * majority being 37 % of 51 % , but let 's gloss over the details opposition ( kod-involved parties ) received 45 % . 
  kod said it was 100k . 
  which looks quite true . 
   was n't jesus replaced with lech kaczy\u0144ski recently ? 
  nuh , lech kaczy\u0144ski is our muhammad ( pis be upon him ) , assumed into heaven at al-wawel . 
  she was even `` crowned '' as a queen back in 17th century . 
  and now there is a small movement to `` crown '' jesus as king , because some catholic mystic woman 100 years ago ( might be not precise here , sorry ) propheted that it would make poland great again . 
  by the way , i had ( past tense , because broke relations long time ago ) a distant uncle-antisemite + fundamentalist catholic , and once reminded him that both mary and jesus were jews . 
  it was fun . 
   dictionary definition of what is left and what is right problem is that dictionary definition does n't really apply to present polish politics . 
  more precise would be to place different parties on ** four ** axles : worldview ( liberal/conservative ) , economic ( etatist/laissez-faire ) , social welfare ( high/low ) and radical/moderate ( this one actually place left + right against centre ) . 
  but it would be too complicated for daily use . 
  however , notice that in many western countries stance on economy & social politics is pivotal in placing who 's left and who 's right . 
  however , in poland it 's ** worldview ** what 's making a difference . 
  seriously ? 
  if pis was centre , it would mean that everything else ( except far-right : rn , onr etc. ), 
  was left . 
  names do n't count . 
  was east germany democratic , because it had `` democratic '' in name ? 
  no problem , because these names can be really confusing .
