  especially if you add council of europe . 
  your changes would abolish eu . 
  btw , i have n't been so 100 % opposite to somebody 's opinions for a long , long time . 
  must give you that . 
   a united european military . 
  united military would be useless without united foreign policy . 
  it has to be both , at the same time . 
  unfortunately it would be very hard to introduce , because it would mean limiting , or even abolishing of national governments ' foreign affairs . 
   make the eu work for the average taxpayer . 
  it mostly does ( sometimes not , as ttip at present ) . 
  eu is behind many small positive changes , e.g. 
  lately abolishment of roaming rates within its borders . 
   because most euro-sceptic parties are directly financed by russia ? 
  and even those who clearly are n't ( like polish pis ) work for russia 's benefit . 
  even if they think & say it 's otherwise . 
   or is drastically democratized with members directly elected by the people . 
  not members , but whole cabinets . 
  ep elections should more akin national ones - with euro-parties campaigning eu-wide , each with its eucommission president ( = eu prime minister ) candidate , as well as commissioners-candidates . 
   as long as the concil is a incomprehensible black box it will be the government easy scapegoat . 
  i think you mistake eucouncil with eucommission . 
   kod , the organisers , are tied to two platforms , a centrist and a rightwing one . 
  not leftwing . 
  there 's only one thing common here - opposition to pis and its government . 
  kod is generally `` supra-political '' , . n centre-liberal , po centre-right , and lewica centre-left . 
  so in simplification , kod is `` wide centre '' . 
  left-wing razem ( kind of like spanish podemos ) did n't join kod , although organised anti-government protests on their own . 
  which is close to kod 's official 100k . 
   the idea of `` ever closer union '' is dead and buried . 
  it 's `` loose union '' what 's not working . 
  `` us of europe '' is only solution , if we want to play any global role in future . 
  but i agree , it 's buried now - because of lack of support . 
  scaremongering works . 
  less power to the national governments , more to ep and european commission , but with more ** direct ** elections ( supernational campaigns of euro-parties , ec president & commissioner candidates known before and actively competing ) . 
  unfortunately , it 's impossible to introduce such changes now . 
  might be even too late . 
  * portugal 1974 : carnation revolution * georgia 2003 : rose revolution * ukraine 2004 : orange revolution * tunisia 2010 : jasmine revolution * macedonia 2016 : paintball revolution, 
  that 's the problem . 
  there are two dominant narratives about brygada \u015awi\u0119tokrzyska ( as well as about cursed soldiers ) . 
  one roughly ( post ) communist , that they were collaborateurs / bandits . 
  and second , `` anticommunist '' , that they were heroes . 
  while truth is complicated ( thereso not useful for propagandists of either side ) , and lies somewhere in between . 
  still , i think that there is more of muslim girls wearing no hijab , than those wearing niqab . 
  what if they have their own houses ? 
  we do n't know social/financial background of these girls . 
   greece , poland and estonia do comly with the recommended 2 % defense spending . 
  unfortunately most of that is retired military pensions ( at least here ) . 
  i suppose they learn about it in schools . 
  actually , most of the questions here seem to be school-related ... 
  i remember big [ 2004 baltic ] ( http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/10933/ ) earthquake . 
  i saw water in glass moving . 
  it was scary !, 
  i do n't have one good solution . 
  sensible pro-marital & social policy is probably the key . 
  like exchanging simple `` check '' social benefits for some kind of purpose bonds ( something like brazilian bolsa fam\u00edlia ? ) . 
  entitling full time mothers to good health insurance ( although imho universal healthcare is best solution ) , and late age pension . 
  development of in vitro . 
  `` fishing rod instead of fish '' policy to poor , immigrants & refugees . 
  all these provided with some strings attached , like obligatory child vaccinations , sending kids to state schools . 
  and of course pro-assimilation policies ( so e.g. 
  no funding of education in immigrant language - it 's job of cultural ngos ) , but through positive policies , not bans or chicanes . 
  it 's just some quick ideas . 
  i surely do n't think all these would be easy , but we have to try at least . 
   europe is finished . 
  if we start to think like you , we certainly would be . 
  because then it either would end in violence , pogroms and war ; or houllebecqish surrender . 
  we have to ** overcome ** it . 
  eu was built upon fundaments of ** compromise ** , and that 's the way we have to stick with . 
  it wo n't be easy , it wo n't be quick . 
  but if it could end in stronger , confident europe - it 's worth it . 
   you have 4 women in the same clothes and no face . 
  i still do n't see an unsolvable problem , unless they all sit in one place . 
  and if they do , it can be solved by seating them apart . 
  if it really does n't work , seat them in front row + force to unveil for a class duration ( so teacher sees them , but most of other students do n't ) . 
  tl ; dr there are gradual solutions , we do n't need to bring big artillery at once . 
   and no a blind ca n't be a teacher probably not at lower levels ( where teacher has to not only teach , but also `` babysit '' the pupils , but higher / college ( = adult ) , why not ? 
   i 'm a semi-militant atheist . 
  you 're not doing a favour to our community . 
  did militant atheism achieved anything anywhere ? 
  soviet union , china , albania ? 
  you ca n't force people to not believe . 
  you can only try to educate , enlighten them . 
  and accomodate fact , that some wo n't change no matter what . 
  * rom , romowie = roma ( official , pc-friendly ) ; * cygan , cyganie = gypsies ( historical & still colloquial , slightly offensive ) ; * rumun , rumuni = colloquial since 1990s , offensive . 
   good point . 
  we should treat religion like alcohol : if yes - it should be every of them . 
  focusing on one only is just chicane . 
  and taxes !, 
   iran and saudi arabia also have legally enforced dress codes . 
  but neither imposes niqab . 
  in iran it 's even rare . 
   and it surely happens in the west as well , as strange as it may sound . 
  i 'm sure it happens sometimes . 
  but if it was common , we 'd hear more about it . 
  and of course while niqab , hijab etc. 
  should n't be banned itselves , forcing anybody to wear them definitely ** should ** . 
   such as jehovah 's witnesses who raise their children to be completely seperate from society . 
  so why are n't we prosecuting them ? 
  jehovah 's have customs more harmful than niqab ( like not using transfusion ) . 
  heck , ** we ** have customs more harmful than niqab , e.g. 
  plastic surgery ( i mean cosmetic , like breast enhancement ; not reconstructive - post-burn etc. ) .
