  but nobody 's talking about banning those ? 
   they do n't have assigned seats ... 
  seriously , i have to explain this ? 
  i 'm talking about sound coming from different places . 
  if you have two sources ( people in this case ) , e.g. 
  one on left , and other on right , and you ca n't recognize from which one the sound ( voice ) is coming , it means you have hearing problems . 
   if the teachers are unable to recognize these people because they ca n't see their faces and distinguish their voices , its a problem . 
  so in the same time you mean that blind people ca n't teach ? 
   people here are graded based on performance throughout the year is n't their performance tracked in the meanwhile as well ? 
  or does teacher have to remember everything at the end of the year ? 
  imho it 'd be prone to bias , e.g. 
  because somebody slacked for most of it , but become more active during last weeks ... 
  seat , not voice . 
  you know why we have two ears ? 
  spatial hearing , that 's why . 
  are you suggesting niqab comes with ventriloquism ? 
  might be useful . 
  you should just stick to ** wallachia ** . 
  or i dunno , dacia . 
  there would be no misunderstanding then . 
  also , give back chad its flag . 
  *** but seriously , i understand your rage . 
  even in late polish [ poll ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg ) romanians ended as third most hated nationality , after arabs and - you guessed it - gypsies . 
  of course we do n't hate you , it 's just that gypsies are called romanians in polish colloquially . 
   the alternative will be civil war in the future . 
  muslims are minority in europe , and will be for decades , if not centuries . 
  population of eu is 510 m , so there would have to be at least 200 m muslims here to become a `` civil war threat '' . 
  there is about 20 m of them now . 
  about 3 % of total . 
  even if whole population of syria , iraq and libya combined would move to eu , it still would be only ~ 80 m against ~ 480 non-muslims . 
  ** numbers ** , man . 
   when you 've been indoctrinated so severely , and forced to wear it from a young age , you come to accept it . 
  or you rebel against it . 
   but let 's not go overboard in our branding of muslim women , hijab wearers are not as objectionable as the far right . 
  exactly . 
  i 'd prefer family of muslims with niqab women as neighbors , than our far righters ( like [ onr ] ( http://www.fakt.pl/m/crop/-850/-484/faktonline/635432709114093831.jpg ) ) . 
   there is no way a kid would wear that stuff by their own volition . 
  i 'm sure there would be , and probably are , such kids . 
  still , i agree - it should be banned for minors . 
  like alcohol . 
  over 18 - do as you wish . 
   the thing is that many , if not most of the women wearing clothes like these does n't do it by choice . 
  in middle east - of course . 
  especially in countries , where it 's imposed culturally ( like yemen , saudi arabia , afghanistan ) , or even as an obligatory law ( isis ... ) . 
  but here in europe ? 
  i think we would hear about it . 
  there would be at least some women asking for help , protesting against such domestic abuse . 
  but it seems to be contrary - most of them ( based on news , docus , interviews ) do it on their own , sometimes even against family opinion . 
   the freedom to wear anything you want in public seems like a pretty basic and inviolable civil liberty to me . 
  banning islamic dress is frankly no better than islamic countries enforcing it . 
  ** this ** . 
  you 're welcome . 
   you do n't actually believe this , do you ? 
  of course not . 
  but they seem to . 
  who am i to impose my opinion on them ? 
   it 's explicitly religious . 
  a religion with an openly hostile anti-progressive attitude . 
  like most religions . 
  just come here and listen to our ( polish ) catholic priests . 
   this is not some fashion statement by a youth subculture and you know it . 
  the thing is , that sometimes yeah , ** it is ** . 
  not in middle east , but among muslim minorities ( and many converts - * holier than the pope * applies here ) in western europe - it happens . 
  rebellion against parents ( e.g. 
  being more assimilated ) , against state . 
  like being a part of some weird subculture . 
  of course , there is a religious `` superstructure '' here , but basic reasons are very similar . 
  40-50 years ago it was radical left , 30-20 years punk and other music subcultures , now - among others - radical islam . 
  10 , 20 years from new something new would be `` hot '' . 
  a propos , recommended [ docu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hhhad_nzu ) . 
   how do you grade a person you have no chance of knowing at a glance ? 
  basing on what she says and writes ? 
  or we should consider grading based on looks a good thing ? 
  on the other hand , if this school is a ** private ** one , it should be free to introduce such ban . 
   i get fucking angry when i see this . 
  it 's so provocative , and does n't belong on our soil . 
  i 'm sure there were people saying such things about women in pants , tattoos , or punk hairstyles in past . 
  there is in * hadiths * ( tales about muhammad ) , however . 
  explanations differ , depending on `` school '' . 
  general ( majority ) opinion is , that while hijab ( headscarf , hair covered , face visible ) is obligatory , niqab is only `` facultative '' , or even only `` permitted '' ( they use different `` legal '' terms here , e.g. 
  * fard * , * wajib * etc. 
  - look it up if you 're interested ) . 
  and there are minorities on opposing sides , one ( `` liberal '' ) considering whole veiling as unobligatory , and other ( `` radical '' , including both militant/terrorist and non-violent groups ) thinking that everything should be veiled . 
  the problem with islam is , that there 's no `` single '' , `` true '' islam . 
  even well-known sunni/shia divide is just an iceberg tip . 
  it 's extremely diverse and fragmented community . 
  which is kind of good for us non-muslims ... 
  so let 's just make a law , that you have to show your face ( to the examiner ) before . 
  or in any similar official situation ( like testifying in court , being checked by traffic police , withdrawing money at bank , voting etc. ) . 
  btw , i ithink it 's still possible to do a written exam in polish universities for somebody else , at least in some faculties . 
  there were people doing so on mine few years ago . 
  without any disguise . 
   afaik , it 's more cultural/traditional than religious it 's complicated . 
  it was used by pre-islamic communities , e.g. 
  in sassanid persia or ( probably ? ), 
  assyria , but mostly among higher classes . 
  so it could be considered as a privilege ( and equality factor ) among early muslims . 
  however , majority of muslim `` schools '' ( of quran explanation ) ** do not ** consider niqab to be a duty ( mostly because quran says nothing clear about it , so it 's based only on * hadiths * ) , but only accept it as something facultative or voluntary . 
  unfortunately , there are also some nutcases ( minority , but a noisy one ) , which believe no inch of female skin should be shown ... 
  this includes both militant groups ( taleban , somali sharia courts , and of course isis ) and some `` amish-like '' , weird but generally non-violent sects ( e.g.
