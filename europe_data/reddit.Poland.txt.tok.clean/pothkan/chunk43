  tablighi jamaat , very active lately in sea ) . 
  and one should also consider , that in some countries niqab ( or similar garments ) always visible and popular for centuries ( e.g. 
  afghanistan , yemen ) ; in some appeared after decades of decline , as part of some islamic revival ( e.g. 
  1970-80s egypt , or 1990s in bosnia ) ; and in other was never used in past , but introduced only lately , via islamic `` globalization '' ( e.g. 
  sea ) . 
  effectively while e.g. 
  in yemen niqab would be a sign of conformism , in western europe it 's rather sign of rebellion , distinction ( often youth one ) . 
  something like punk mohawk , but totally au rebours ... 
  so exactly where niqab is intended to be worn . 
   a single class at the school ( its a school for adults ) hmm . 
  i 'm not sure if it should be banned , if they are ** adults ** ( of course it definitely should be so for minors ) . 
  it might be their own choice . 
   and here i thought only us romanian did this . 
  but we at least only have barbecue in front of our blocks . 
  some people in poland have barbecues on their balconies . 
  darwin award anybody ? 
  that 's why ikarus buses were used on night lines ( e.g. 
  in tricity ) few years after they were already withdrawn from daylight service . 
  i wonder - how many niqab-wearing students there are in denmark , actually ? 
  is it a major problem ? 
   i am not sure these people should be treated like heroes . 
  they considered soviets & polish communists to be more significant enemy , then nazis . 
  and effectively they went rogue from legal ( london exile ) government , making some deals with germans ( including being trained & dropped by luftwaffe behind soviet lines ) . 
  generally , something like chetniks in yugoslavia . 
  neither heroes , neither villains . 
  concerning their role in liberation of holesov : when nazi forces surrendered & dispersed , swietokrzyska was left on its own , and planned to reach american lines . 
  camp came by the way . 
  as they were n't primarily pro-nazi , they had no reason to not help prisoners . 
  one can compare it to roa ( vlasov 's army ) role in prague uprising in those days , when russians helped czechs against nazis . 
  and portugal . 
  why dark red ? 
  so ... commence class war ? 
  still better than racism , though . 
  german engineering at work . 
  we are talking about 1945 here , not korean war ... 
   ussr planned , prepared and initiated the initial invasion of south that started the korean war this theory was already debunked . 
  initial invasion was kim 's idea , probably with mao 's encouragement . 
  ussr joined ( secretly ) their effort later of course , including some soviet planes with soviet pilots ( and korean markings ) . 
  they did , albeit shortly . 
  there was a naval landing in rajin ( rason ) . 
  vietnamese are single `` exotic '' minority here . 
  ~ 50k in ~ 40m country might be tiny number , but that 's still more than any other nationality ( of course except `` native '' - non-exotic ones , like ukrainians ) . 
  pizza . 
   so it 's the same old romanian-roma confusion . 
  yup , nothing else hidden there . 
  heh , just like gazeta.pl compared to paper gazeta wyborcza here in poland . 
  true . 
  remember : populism is a ** tool ** , not ideology . 
  it 's overused by right-wing / alt-right now , but can be , and sometimes is , used by liberals or moderates as well . 
  hear , hear . 
   nasser in egypt , linked to above , of course certainly did not make friends with the islamists . 
  nasser himself was a figure charismatic and smart enough to counter islamist opposition . 
  unfortunately , each of his successors were less talented and more corrupted . 
  by the way , it 's interesting , that only arab countries , which were - and are - relatively free of toxic islamism , are moderate ( at least partly constitutional ) monarchies - jordan , morocco , oman ( although in this case different kind of islam plays a major role ) , maybe also kuwait . 
   we have apr\u00edl as well , but we only use it when referring to april 1st we call it in latin ( prima aprilis ) . 
  listopad ( `` falling leaves '' ) means october in croatian , and november in polish . 
   you mean the birthplace of said religion ? 
  kind of . 
  reform movements of islam mostly started elsewhere - e.g. 
  turkey , egypt , india - while mecca was pretty much `` frozen in time '' . 
  however , in the 16-18th centuries it was open to different schools . 
  it changed with wahhabi conquest . 
  here 's [ recommended reading ] ( https://www.amazon.com/mecca-sacred-city-ziauddin-sardar/dp/1620402661 ) . 
   because they did n't insulate themselves in the first place . 
  things is , if we 'd start to punish people for `` insulating themselves '' , we 'd have to target e.g. 
  nuns or amish-type communities . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with `` insulation '' , as long no state law is being broken . 
  by the way , notice that recent islamist terrorists in the europe were n't exactly this type of people . 
  au contraire - in their `` cvs '' there are often episodes of common criminal activity , drugs , sometimes even prison . 
   do you honestly believe people who criticize islam here would try to defend breivik ? 
  problem is that you fail to notice similarity : blaming islam ( in the whole ) for islamist terrorism is exactly like blaming christianity for crimes of breivik * et consortes * . 
  religion does n't kill , ** people do ** . 
   most people on this sub is their biggest enemy it does n't matter , ** everybody ** is considered as enemy by isis and similar movements . 
   when you 're a minority , you tend to understand what other minorities are going through . 
  this . 
   islam had no reformation and no enlightenment . 
  it had , and actually in few waves . 
  major one in 19th century . 
  then there was a wave of secularization roughly in 1930s-60s . 
  unfortunately , it was 1 . forced from the top , 2 . sometimes merged with `` arab socialism '' . 
  which lead to islamists being core of anti-authoritarian opposition in countries like iran or egypt . 
  and last but not least , modern islam is infected with ** one specific branch ** , which was born ~ 250 years ago in the middle of desert , and would stay there , if certain mineral was n't found there ~ 80 years ago . 
  saudis are founding mosques and giving out copies of quran , supporting their narrow vision of religion . 
  please do n't give it to kaczy\u0144ski , he could have some ideas . 
   different nationalism though . 
  exactly . 
  it 's pretty much only a name in this case . 
  and it 's ** national ** , not nationalist ( which makes a difference , kind of like islamic and islamist ) . 
  shortest response : nationalism . 
   you either want to kill innocent people or you i meant `` wannabe terrorist '' . 
  lone wolf = acting alone , probably without any assistance from any cells ( maybe except online contacts ? ) . 
  it does n't mean he 's not a piece of shit , of course . 
   it is difficult to deny that societies that now already have a large muslim demographic will sometime in the future face islam as the potential majority faith . 
  not gon na happen . 
  maybe except case of ** relative ** majority , due to secularization of society , and only if you do n't count `` non-believers '' as a faith . 
  hypothetical : 35 % non-believers , 20 % muslim , 18 % catholic , 16 % protestant . 
  that could indeed be in some countries , in few decades . 
   that increasing the population of muslims in the infidel societies to slowly spread islam is a philosophy that is being pursued . 
  point is that it has no chance of success ( on large scale ) . 
  and if you think about converts - i 'd guess their number does n't even cover loss due to some born-muslims being secularized .
