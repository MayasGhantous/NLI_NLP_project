  plus it could work only if view of muslims as an unified monolyth was true . 
  while they 're no less divided , than we are . 
   problem is , part of their tactics is to replace the population of a country from the inside . 
  it would need decades of constant immigration , linked with high rate of reproduction . 
  while statistics prove , that each successive generation ( of muslim immigrants , data from uk and germany ) breeds less . 
  about `` replacement via immigration '' - it would need ~ 8-10m yearly to make it in 50 years . 
  which is completely unrealistic ( number was over 1,5 m in record 2015 , now it dropped to ~ 500k ) . 
  and would deplete most of arab population worldwide , by the way . 
  remember , that except countries with native muslim population ( bih , albania , kosovo - none in the eu btw ) , nowhere in europe muslims count more than 10 % ( maybe except france , where it might be 10-12 % now ) . 
  which means , that muslims would have to roughly ** decuple ** their number in short time . 
   last i checked , all of these attackers were muslim , following islam . 
  and most of their victims ( on global scale ) are muslims too . 
   there is nothing that terrorists want more than for their enemies to have complacent societies what isis wants , is to make all muslims come and help them in building `` the caliphate '' . 
  they want european etc. 
  muslims to be hated , deported etc. 
  - because then they will have nothing else to do , than turn to islamic state . 
  remember , this is an ** end of days ** movement . 
  they want to wage a total war . 
  and ** hate ** is their real weapon . 
  exactly . 
  there 's not much difference between people like breivik and lahouaiej . 
  it 's two sides of the same sickness . 
   how 'd anyone justify attacking sweden though ? 
  do n't expect terrorists ( or crazy lone wolf wannabes , which is a usual case lately ) to act rational . 
  tbh , paveli\u0107 would be actually even better . 
  and slovak is just a weather forecast . 
   well . . in the italy 's one , poland is involved ... :d and vice versa . 
   those are literally the words of the current serbian anthem . 
  it was/is pretty common theme in monarchies ' anthems . 
  russian * bozhe tsarya khrani * , british * god save the queen/king * ... 
  oh boy , we are no longer the worst ? 
   it 's other way around - 2 years minimum you meant maximum ? 
  eu might try to avoid uk taking part in next ep elections ( spring 2019 ) , so ... 
  and in polish `` pastor '' means protestant clergyman . 
   edit : it does !, 
  just not in croatian !, 
  :d ah , another case of `` false friend of the slavist '' :d, 
  i would say he was ( is ) a symbol of foreign volunteers in waffen-ss . 
  mostly thanks to publicity ( hitler 's * if i had a son , i would want him to be like you * , postwar memoirs etc. ) . 
  definitely not a `` footnote name '' . 
  such changes ( in popular feeling ) usually means that either something really bad happened , or people were morbidly uninformed about given topic . 
   is anyone even slightly surprised by this graph ? 
  i am , as a non-brit . 
  it 's worse than i thought . 
   they could inform themselves god damn [ always relevant ] ( https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/slide13.png ) . 
   we 've given you access to belarus already too . 
  it works only for people coming by air into minsk . 
  not land borders . 
   the catholic nazi !, 
  [ erhm ? 
  ] ( http://www.eestileegion.com/public/images/relvass/liidrid/degrelle/degrelle-2.jpg ), 
   sweet and hot goes together well habanero chocolate !, 
  there is strong possibility that fsb made 1999 bombings ( including aborted one in ryazan ) , dubrovka and beslan to boost his ratings and help him win elections in 2000 . 
  they used some chechen islamists ( mostly unknowing pawns , recruited by agents ) , and helped other ones ( people like basayev ) to oust moderate ( legal ) chechen government . 
  result : second chechen war , with more people killed in cleansing , than by various forces in yugoslavia few years before . 
  and of course there are also numerous mysterious deaths of various people , often digging into cases mentioned above , russian atrocities in chechnya , or even just putin 's corruption in 1990s piter . 
  litvinenko , politkovskaya , markelov , estemirova , lately nemtsov ... 
   but i hate le pen much more than putin , trump etc. 
  on the other hand , compared to putin - she at least is n't a war criminal . 
  just his puppet . 
   you just have to learn that \u8eca by itself is pronounced `` kuruma '' . 
  unless it 's used in compound word ( e.g. 
   you can construct the sentence in the exact same way in russian . 
  because slavic languages have elastic word order . 
  you can throw verb anywhere ( although svo is mostly used ) . 
  while in german it has to be there , in the ending . 
  nope , hus . 
  there was also * za dom spremni * - at least used by less nice croatia aka ndh . 
   b\u00f3g , honor , ojczyzna ( god , honor , fatherland ) trivia : god was added only by government in exile ( and accepted after 1989 ) . 
  during 1918-1939 2nd republic it was just * honor i ojczyzna * . 
  only among nationalists and `` patriots '' . 
  originally to russian decembrists , but it 's mostly associated with polish volunteers in hungarian 1848 revolution , and ( especially during communist period ) international brigades in spain . 
   if russian government wants somebody dead , they kill them . 
  they do n't go after their own civilians . 
  1999 bombings , dubrovka , beslan - all these attacks might be prepared by fsb , to boost putin 's ratings . 
  it 's morbidly strange , that many people digging into this topics ended dead later . 
  have n't seen one yet . 
  i 'd recommend [ this book ] ( http://lubimyczytac.pl/ksiazka/121756/jordania ) ( and whole series , actually ) , unfortunately it 's in polish . 
  otherwise , i just try to be `` informed '' , by reading news and articles in decent press titles . 
  i suppose english wikipedia would be a good start , although it often involves `` wall of text '' problem . 
  true , but there was a difficult change in 1970-80s - mostly absorbing high number of palestinian population . 
  marriage of king abdullah is probably a good symbol that it ended in relative success . 
   meanwhile 3city has classic przedwiosnie it 's actually quite warm now , about 15 c. i went from parka week ago to no jacket today . 
  variety of people 's clothing is quite funny - from girls in hooded down jackets and gloves , to mini skirts and open toe shoes . 
  high energy ! ... 
   morocco as well . 
  they had a referendum and passed some progressive reforms . 
  same in jordan . 
  i mean trying to convince them . 
   it took a great deal of self-restraint for me not to go off on a rant . 
  why did n't you ? 
  of course in non-offending way . 
  who else could change their point of view , if not close family ? 
  nah , i understand them ( native polish , know russian & croatian ) fine enough without such help . 
  but i laugh whenever i happen to find any google-translations of polish . 
  it still fails miserably against glorious slavic grammar . 
  and they were definition of europoor before big 04 ' eupgrade . 
  you 're welcome . 
  but seriously , save obvious things ( antiquity , tzatziki , zorba etc. 
  ) : they had civil war in late 1940s , some refugees were taken by us ( yup , there was a time when poland was refugee-welcoming ) , and that 's why there is still a small greek minority here .
