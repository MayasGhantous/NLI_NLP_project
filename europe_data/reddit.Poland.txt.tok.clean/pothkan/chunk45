   i 've always wondered why it 's so hard to hold a flag mostly because nationalists take possession of patriotic symbolism . 
   also , was n't albania already a muslim country in europe ? 
  it was , although there 's difference : bosniak nationality is based on religion ( even if a given person is n't religious at all ) , it 's the only thing which differs bosniaks from croats or serbs ( save very minuscule language differences ) . 
  they were even called just `` muslims '' during tito 's yugoslavia . 
  while albanians are multi-faith nation ( muslim majority , but also catholic and orthodox christians - at least in albania , in kosovo they 're nearly entirely muslims ) , so religion is a secondary identity factor for them . 
   i 'm perfectly fine with people in austria not having kids though . 
  yup . 
  two world wars were enough . 
  we should push for all-european army . 
  if you 're on board , it 's entirely possible - even moron governments like ours would n't mind ( actually , one of rare kaczy\u0144ski 's sane ideas , is that he 's very pro-euarmy ) . 
  although similarity in turnout ( ~ 50-55 % ) is very noticeable . 
   call england and ask nicely about the whole colony deal . 
  [ magba ] ( http://trending.com/reddit/2017-02-07/make-america-great-britain-again_preview.jpg ), 
   ( our voter participation rate is atrociously low ) i feel you , same here . 
   it 's kind of insecure of him since he is using actual physical force rather than more subtle means , whatever those may be , to assert any semblance of dominance . 
  smart man ( or woman , as in merkel 's case ) would use ** words ** . 
  witty comment , maybe even nuanced joke . 
  problem is , that trump is n't smart . 
  i feel worse , because i know these people have same voting rights as everybody else . 
   it 's a protestant/lutheran ( ? ), 
  vs. catholic thing ( hiding vs. showing your wealth ) . 
  i would rather say protestant vs everything else . 
  see russia ( orthodox ) , brunei ( muslim ) , thailand ( buddhist ) . 
  japan might be an exception , though - they always were able to present themselves in style ( meaning , without lots of gold etc. 
  he is german ... 
  it 's certain he did . 
  it is n't so simple . 
  not every catholic is a nationalist , and not every nationalist cares about religion . 
  plus there is `` famous '' 1v1 talk in sopot with putin ( sep 1st , 2009 ) . 
  and as we know putin speaks no english , but is fluent in german - and tusk does n't speak russian ( please no cod memes !, 
  ) , it 's obvious which language they used . 
  what would you except from man who does n't speak ** any ** foreign language ? 
  ( which fits also majority of pis politicians overall ), 
   so argument `` your ancestors fight on the wrong side '' is just the bait for the stupid people . 
  yeah , but it worked . 
  it 's widely considered as factor which made him lose 2005 presidentials . 
  yes , but he did n't have a choice - forced conscription . 
  it happened to few hundred thousands of poles ( and kashubians , silesians ) in pomorze and upper silesia - pretty common `` family story '' there . 
  it was a taboo subject after war , so many `` central / eastern '' poles ( areas where pis has higher support ) do n't know about that , for them serving in wehrmacht = treason . 
  r/the _ donek leaking !, 
   i need citation for this difference . 
  the term used was untermensch . 
  problem is , those were mostly not official ( law-dealing ) terms . 
  used in propaganda etc. 
  also notice , that jews were often being entirely dehumanized , e.g. 
  compared to vermins , bugs etc. 
  actual treatment of poles was more nuanced ( still bad , but nowhere similar to jews ) . 
  i recommend [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/dark-heart-hitlers-europe-government/dp/1780764774/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1489711124&amp;sr=8-2 ) , author quite well presents different treatment of various groups in the gg . 
  orban is hypocritical , which gives hungary some hope . 
  kaczy\u0144ski and his circle are unfortunately just nutz . 
   and this is why a two speed europe is a good thing . 
  to be honest , i agree . 
  maybe being left behind will make us come back to our senses . 
  at least , man can hope ... 
   and i must say , its working . 
  unfortunately , while economic ( and infrastructural ) `` kick '' is indeed working , mental is n't . 
  we 're held back by our own dark forces , and unless something good happens in 2019 , our future looks gloomy . 
  and nobody would be to blame than us ( although i 'm sure pis would blame germans anyway ) . 
   they operated solely for genocidal reasons . 
  and still ~ 70-80 % of inmates survived . 
  again , ** death camps ** were used solely to exterminate people - examples are treblinka or sobib\u00f3r . 
  mortality in those were nearly 100 % . 
  there were also `` mixed '' category camps , best example is auschwitz ii ( jewish inmates - mortality over 90 % ) . 
  while in concentration or labor camps extermination was n't the main purpose . 
  mortality varied , e.g. 
  in soviet gulag ( or polish cop-s ) it was around 20 % , in nazi kl-s ( non-jewish inmates ) around 50 % . 
  and you clearly not know history . 
  i wrote `` aryan '' in the wide meaning , which nazis used to e.g. 
  divide cities in gg ( `` aryan sides '' , contrary to `` non-aryan '' ghettos ) , or inmates in concentration camps ( `` non-aryan '' jews and gypsies , `` aryan '' everybody else , including slavs ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghettos_in_nazi-occupied_europe#aryan_side  nazi ideology viewed the slavic peoples as non-aryan untermenschen ( `` sub-humans '' ) , who were targeted for enslavement , expulsion and extermination . 
  nazi stance on slavs was n't really clear , and heavily depended on location and period . 
  notice , that some slavic countries ( croatia , slovakia , bulgaria ) were allied with iii reich . 
  according to most probable plans ( including famous generalplan ost ) , `` only '' polish ** elites ** were to be exterminated ( which was actually started by nazis ) , while some `` racially worthy '' were to be germanized ( including forced kidnapping of children ) , and majority ** subjugated to slavery ** . 
  nothing recent , because polish edition came 6 years ago . 
   i 'm polish and this is the first time i 'm hearing about this book , it 's author , or the supposed controversy they caused in my country . 
  original ( polish ) edition was published in 2011 , and it ended in the shade of more widely noticed gross ' * z\u0142ote \u017cniwa * . 
  so you could miss / not remember it , but it was spoken about . 
  concentration ( or labor ) camp is n't the same as ** death ** camp . 
  first ones were ( and are ) established by numerous regimes . 
  second , exclusively by nazi germans , to exclusively kill jews ( maybe croatian jasenovac fits here also , but only partially ) . 
  mortality rate for polish ( and other `` aryan '' ) inmates in auschwitz was around 50 % , for jewish ( birkenau ) over 90 % . 
   the picture looks nice and at the end of the trip we 're gone be in that region . 
  by the way , if you like `` necrotourism '' , i strongly recommend \u0141\u00f3d\u017a 's cemeteries . 
  precisely , [ old christian ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/stary_cmentarz_w_%c5%81odzi ) ( neighboring lutheran , orthodox and catholic sections ; first one includes badass chapel of [ karl scheibler ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kaplica+scheiblera&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi8o5re_nnsahwbpcwkhys4atqq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=560 ) ; there is also an interesting grave of orthodox husband and catholic wife , divided by the fence between the sections ) , and [ new jewish ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nowy_cmentarz_%c5%bcydowski_w_%c5%81odzi ) ( you have to pay a small fee there ) - this one includes [ mausoleum of izrael pozna\u0144ski ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mauzoleum+izraela+pozna%c5%84skiego&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg6dkp_dnsahugdywkhuwgaqcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=560 ) , said to be biggest jewish grave anywhere . 
   i 'll take a look at the movie if it was even nominated for an oscar it must be good . 
  there 's also mini-series ( four episodes ) , which includes afaik everything shown in the movie , so could be considered as `` director 's cut '' - it 's actually only ~ 15 % longer . 
   even the constitution was n't changed much , to tell the truth , and on paper it 's still quite democratic . ), 
  that 's the point . 
  1936 constitution was the same . 
   by 1939 poles were also labeled subhumans . 
  while jews were n't considered as humans at all . 
  that 's the difference . 
   are they known in poland not really , at least not widely . 
  i 've heard it , but i 'm actually kind of interested in story of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ( not from there , just really like this city ) . 
  it has that `` turpist authenticity '' . 
  i would compare \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to our national dish , * bigos * - rather ugly looks , elusive smell ... but when you dig into its rich taste , it 's heaven in the mouth . 
  and of course * promised land * - best thing made in polish cinema ever ) . 
  unless he get nixon 'd . 
  me the same ( although i do n't watch the stream , just check this thread ) . 
  is it ... smell of european unity ?
