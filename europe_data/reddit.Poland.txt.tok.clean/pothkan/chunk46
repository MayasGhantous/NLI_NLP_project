   we 're some mindless orc horde that 's about to zerg rush kekekeke, 
  true . 
  nevertheless , you know what i meant . 
   dwindling popular support at best rising actually . 
  pis stance helped him here , not damaged . 
   putin is a cunning wolf while erdogan is a rabid dog , both are dangerous for different reasons . 
  true . 
  but look at putin 's record . 
  faked ( false flag ) bombings , so he could bounce support via fearmongering , and win elections in 2000 . 
  than , provoked war in chechnya ( manipulating chechens , so people like basayev - more useful as enemies - would come stronger than moderates like maskhadov ) , including plain ethnic cleansing ( ~ 50k dead civilians - comparable to serbian crimes in bih ) . 
  shady circumstances behind dubrovka and beslan . 
  long list of suspicious deaths among his opponents or whistleblowers ( if erdogan was putin , g\u00fclen would be dead long time ago ) . 
  numerous forged elections ( while erdogan , let 's give him that , won some of those honestly ) . 
  of course , georgia and ukraine . 
  and let 's not even start about over two decades of stealing and corruption . 
  erdogan is a bastard ... but again , those are different leagues . 
  i mean what was built above . 
  btw , could you check `` 23 gedimino pr . '', 
  building ? 
  it looks suprisingly like 2nd republic 1930s modernism ( which my city is famous for ) , i 'd like to check whether i guess right . 
   turkey even makes places like russia let 's stay calm . 
  erdogan is a lamb compared to putin . 
  and turkey did n't attack two of its neighbors under his rule . 
  naah , it 's not so bad . 
  needs some paint and cleaning , however . 
  and tbh `` it does n't fit there '' could be also said about most of modern steel/glass architecture . 
  by the way ... that 's a [ horrible case ] ( https://www.google.lt/maps/@54.6872002,25.2709403,3a,75y,8.75h,98.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spg_-ov050a08psz69hhw8a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=lt ) . 
  which i 'm afraid , has nothing to do with ussr . 
  i kind of guess what you mean , but could you give some examples ? 
  i mean , exactly from vilnius . 
  butthurt is our national pastime ... 
  actually stalinist architecture was pretty much based on american 20s one . 
  compare pkin etc. 
  to empire state building . 
  soviet buildings went shitty after that ... but on the other hand , more useful structures were built . 
  take famous * khrushchevka * blocks for example - they 're awful , but for many russians it was first own , private ( albeit tiny ) place to live - after decades of crowded * komunalka * s. 
  paw\u0142owicz on her twitter . 
  although it was hardly suprising , she is very predictable . 
  plus i 've heard somebody asked on radio ( suski ... ? 
  i 'm not sure now , it was two months ago ) . 
  but to be honest , these voices were rare , and there was also one positive ( czarnecki ) . 
  so maybe not `` bashed '' , but definitely they mostly kept silent until jk 's response . 
  i 'm not speaking about 50/50 divide , scotland should receive of course only a fraction . 
  but still . 
  not much would be needed , i suppose squadron or two of fighters and three frigates would be enough as backbone . 
  anything german during vhs era in poland = porn . 
  biggest meta-joke was when at first pis politicians bashed it ( first episode ) hard , and when kaczy\u0144ski said he actually kind of liked it , they instantly moved to praising . 
  but should n't scottish independence lead to divide of raf aircraft or rn ships ? 
  just like happened with e.g. 
  czechoslovakian or soviet military ? 
   i sometimes feel like the polish government genuinely believes their whole culture war bullshit . 
  because they do . 
   plus , nobody in their sane mind expected ... 
  i did . 
  although i have to admit , i was really surprised how quickly they started . 
  yes ... whole 19 % of us . 
  also , eu policy ( except resettlement of refugees ) was n't an issue during campaign . 
  which one ? 
  you know , we have three of them now . 
  [ ekhm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_witcher ), 
  belgian pm basically said that yesterday . 
  and yes we are , problem is that pis side does n't acknowledge that we should give something in return . 
  like , at least being a reasonable country . 
  fuck that . 
  yes please . 
  oh you innocent boy ... you have it since few weeks only . 
  hey , at least your government did n't allow us to use spain for illegal jails . 
   do you think there 's any hope that kaczynski will eventually lose his influence over the party ? 
  nope , it 's a cult . 
  and when he dies , pis will collapse . 
  crusaders would be krzy\u017cowcy . 
  in the same news they * reminded * how tusk `` did n't prevent immigrant crisis '' , and * presented * `` sharia law zones in sweden '' . 
  by the way , one of tvp journalists , samuel r. pereira ( came there from strongly pro-pis media ; fun trivia : he 's half-portuguese ) said that choice of tusk was decided during sigmar gabriel + lavrov meeting . 
  tl ; dr it 's ribbentrop-molotov bis . 
  send help . 
  [ somebody did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yho2d/todays_graphic_on_rpolska/deqid1e/ ), 
  better one : [ monster hunter ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ecgf5ij.jpg ) ( made by u/tolkfan ), 
  sadly , it was n't translated afaik . 
  but you 'd probably understand it ~ 150 , even 100 years ago :(, 
  hey , i just tried to update . 
  just look at him [ speaking in sejm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g60ydlrhpy ) . 
  full * gomu\u0142ka mode * on . 
   kaczy\u0144ski is so assblasted he did n't even comment this . 
  he did , in sejm just now . 
  that po is an `` external force '' now . 
  and pm szyd\u0142o said that `` we wo n't sign under this decision '' . 
  although it reminds me of one [ less-known story ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20130922000740/http://sapkowski.pl/modules.php?name=news&amp;file=article&amp;sid=410 ) ( 1992 ) by andrzej sapkowski . 
   no to mention amber gold controversy with his son . 
  [ amber gold vs skok ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b6mybsv.jpg ) ( and keep in mind , this image is ~ year old - while ag is already done , skoks are still an active damage ) . 
  first , it 's reelection . 
  second , only plain majority is needed . 
  and tusk actually received 96 % here . 
  brutally speaking : do you prefer to be gagging with shit in your mouth , or stand in it up to your knees ? 
  elections are n't candy shop , sometimes you have to choose lesser evil . 
   china has no need to protect them unless they fear america will close them exactly . 
  it should be . 
   it makes people think that he is the equivalent of the potus or other head of state . 
  he is , but in the german meaning , not french or american one . 
  too late for parliamentary elections , but his term would end just in time for 2020 presidential ones . 
   the president of the european council is not really the `` eu president '' but i guess journalists will be journalists .
