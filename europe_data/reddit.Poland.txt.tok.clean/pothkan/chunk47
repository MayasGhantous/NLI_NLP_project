  he 's closest to this term . 
  just keep in mind , that 's more german - than french-style president . 
  exactly . 
  it 's sad , that fear against 5 or 10k refugees ( a tiny amount for nearly 40m country , especially if they 'd be dispersed ) might be probably a crucial factor , which threw us into shithole , which is pis rule . 
  fearmongering worked . 
   poland even voted for refugee distribution for example . 
  it was previous government . 
   how is pis taking this exactly ? 
  silence + denial . 
   lastly : will this benefit the opposition ? 
  imho it will be an another small blow to pis support . 
  nothing big will change , but they 're constantly bleeding out . 
  slowly , but still . 
  my point is that chinese are building `` blue '' seapower to ensure ** safety ** of waterways ( of course primarily for themselves , but at the same time it helps in overall maritime security ) , not to block them . 
  and exactly that 's why we should federalize . 
  do you seriously compare deadly failures of great leap and cultural revolution with present ( still small ) recession ? 
  exactly . 
  in jordan ~ 98 % of marriages are monogamic . 
  even if polygamy is legal , it does n't mean it 's common . 
  what about mormons ? 
  [ pis today ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wzljpmoxs4 ), 
   seems to me that they risk relations with allies only for a poor national vendetta . . that 's the point . 
  exactly . 
  imho there is strong connection between high level islamophoby in eastern & east central europe ( including former gdr - notice where afd has strongest support ) , and small number of actual muslim immigrants there . 
   with proper armaments they could cut of the straits of malacca and block the free trade of the sea . 
  question - why would they ? 
  free trade is backbone of chinese economy . 
  [ awww ... ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/love+these+little+_92e9958971a2c289ecf19d64790f7e13.png ), 
  of course . 
  what i mean , that economic rivalry does n't mean = military one . 
  imho china , being a country deeply involved in global trade , is actually a positive factor to global security . 
  any high-scale conflict is against their basic interests . 
   even did storm `` wprost '' ( a magazine with leaks of another scandal ) and ties to russian or pro-russian ( ukraine , pre-2014 donbas ) circles . 
  same about falenta . 
  best wishes from cesspit !, 
  send help . 
  where do i have to sign ? 
  i 'm 1/32 german , is it enough ? 
  china is an obvious economic rival ( but tbh , same can be said about e.g. 
  usa or japan ) , but i do n't see it as a military threat to europe . 
  or actually anywhere else , maybe except eastern asia itself . 
  we have no gain in going against chinese - actually otherwise , they could be a counter to putinist russia . 
  not majority - 62 % voted for other parties . 
  problem is , that ~ 15 % votes were lost due to not crossing the threshold , and that our system gives a huge boost to party achieving first result . 
  not u/zee-utterman comment , but u/solewanderer thread . 
  minority of us . 
  38 % of voters - 19 % even , if you count non-voting . 
  they do n't have constitutional majority . 
   speak for yourself - common borders of eu is the first step to creating a federal eu . 
  good . 
  that 's the problem . 
  we are afraid of danger muslim immigrants can pose ( terrorism ) , while not being able to acknowledge what positive they could make to our society and country . 
  we see a stereotype , not a real human beings . 
   even the majority of pis voters is in favor of the eu but it 's still a `` gib monies '' / `` they owe us '' stance . 
  while other side is more honestly pro-eu . 
   he should 've stayed neutral in the conflict between the eu and warsaw . 
  having - and showing - opinion , is one of his strongest assets . 
  he has balls to say things which should be said , like recently about trump being a worrying case . 
  that 's why tusk is much better than `` invisible '' van rompuy . 
  do n't mind this guy . 
  he does n't like germans ** a lot ** ( flair is kind of self-irony probably ) . 
   we have a slight split personality . 
  and adding to that , we are deeply divided . 
  i already noticed it , see edited comment above . 
  again , brainfart . 
  it should be `` in spite of '' , typo or error on my side . 
  and obviously used wrong - a late night brainfart . 
  actually it was called `` french disease '' ( * franca * ) in poland as well , definitely more frequently than `` german disease '' . 
  or benches . 
  and asking everybody if they have any problem . 
   for the polish flag in xviii c. with the colors crimson , navy blue , and white , also any two in combination . 
  actually it was proposed only in 1863 , during january uprising . 
   the entire polish electorate is anti-russia . 
  maybe except some ( not all ) nationalist groups , and partly sld ( old habits die hard ) . 
  still , we can safely say that over 80 % of poles are anti-putinist , and probably half them russophobe in general . 
  nah , i 'm pro-strong germany . 
  we need them now . 
  they are . 
  putin is smart enough to understand , that plainly pro-russian party has no chance here . 
  but pis is eurosceptic ( not pl-exit , but pro- `` loose union '' ) . 
  that 's enough for putin . 
  as long as pis is undermining eu unity , they are `` useful idiots '' for kremlin . 
  that 's why russia surely supports them via infowar , without their knowledge . 
  ukraine is another factor . 
  pis is less keen to support it than staunchly pro-kiev po , mostly because many pis voters hold deep grudge over ukrainian cult of upa , because of atrocities done by this movement against poles . 
  guys , please calm down . 
  we really do n't need another 1974 . 
  hey , polan stronk !, 
   with a small air force and only a small arsenal of missiles . 
  still , without navy brits would have no chance to get falklands back . 
  and yeah , on one hand you have success of argentinian af ... on other rip general belgrano . 
  because seas are still spine of trade . 
  and of course force projection , especially submarines . 
  land installations or airfields can be bombed ... good luck finding submerged submarine , which can stay under water for days , few weeks even . 
   first brexit , then trump , and now france . 
  nope . 
  polish elections were first . 
  there is visible russian/donbas * stench * behind so called `` tapes affair ( s ) '' of 2014/15 ( mostly ties of marek falenta and * wprost * journal owners ) . 
  hey , here too !, 
  what is it , a thumbnail ?
