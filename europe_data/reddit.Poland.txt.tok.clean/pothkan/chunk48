  this spike is result of changes in definition of rape in swedish law . 
  which means that deeds probably to be dismissed or ignored by police elsewhere , there are acknowledged and prosecuted . 
  and of course that leads to swedish women being less reluctant to go to the police . 
  actually there 's some similarity to irish situation , at least from ~ 80 years ago . 
  two rightist parties coming from one core , deeply hating each other . 
  same mentality . 
  although it 's more putinism than recepism . 
   can you give me example of civilization without religion/cults who had any success in human history ? 
  china ? 
  their civilization was built mostly on confucian philosophy ( not really religious ) . 
   if you want that population will cheat , steal and had 0 morality just tell them that god does not exist . 
  examples of countries with mostly atheist/non-religious population : sweden , czechia , japan . 
  i would rather say that they are more ** radical ** ( right-leaning ) , not conservative . 
  there is some minor silesian nationalist following among ruch chorz\u00f3w supporters . 
  but that 's rather shallow posing only , and kind of counter against polish nationalism popular among supporters of other football clubs . 
  not really , at least not mostly them . 
  average kukiz voter is somebody who hates both po ( more ) and pis , is low-informed , but cares enough to vote . 
  and of course post-korwinists . 
  exactly , they 're bleeding out slowly . 
  which could be actually good , because as long as poll results ( pis vs opposition ) are equal , opposition will feel forced to unite forces . 
   notice how the right wing is on the rise in every european country , ever wondered why ? 
  because it 's easier to blame others , than notice and solve real problems - both for politicians , and citizens themselves . 
  just like 1929 crisis lead to rise of antisemitism . 
   i ca n't understand why poland is obsessed with immigration . 
  not racism , but exactly ** xenophoby ** - ` fear of the other ' . 
  we lack knowledge about other cultures , religions etc. 
   parties completely disregarding security , immigration policies and tradition security ? 
  po strengthened our position in eu , which is best insurance against putin 's russia . 
  loosened eu = vulnerable eu . 
  tradition ? 
  when did po fought with it ? 
  even * \u017bo\u0142nierze wykl\u0119ci * day was established by komorowski . 
  and they allowed pis supporters to direct ipn . 
  and immigration is just a scarecrow used by right-wing populists to fearmonger . 
  just like in a certain movie ( actually comic book ) about a guy in a hat and mask . 
  if schetyna will have best chance to oust pis , we have to vote for po . 
  sad but necessary . 
  we cant ' risk dispersion of votes ( which would be a result of voting `` by heart '' ) in 2019 . 
  united we stand , divided we fall . 
  of course , you 're right . 
  problem that nationalism is a symptom , not solution . 
  problem is - why anybody should care about it ? 
  lent is * post * in polish . 
   for my life i ca n't understand so many people love short response - nationalism . 
  moderate one leads to such authoritarian results , radical one ... 
  i do n't need to tell , you surely know your history :(, 
   afaik he did not . 
  he was excluded from po only few days ago , when this news come up . 
  true about not joining pis however - but there 's gossip he will join gowin 's party ( small coalition partner of pis ) . 
  still , result is rather positive for tusk . 
  and actually proves we are divided between `` pis '' and `` everybody else '' camps ( actually there 's also third `` do n't give a shit '' one ) . 
   germany had a 48 % turnout during the last ep elections , poland -- 23 % which among else , resulted in election of korwin-mikke aka worse than farage . 
  we are really sorry . 
   how popular is tusk in poland ? 
  according to polls : more popular than kaczy\u0144ski ( who is one of less popular politicians overall ) , less than duda and szyd\u0142o ( who are very popular ) . 
  and do n't ask how it 's possible ( that puppets are widely popular , while puppetmaster is not ) . 
  on the other hand , tusk is more liked than any opposition leader . 
  i prefer ece ( east central europe ) abbreviation . 
  it fits perfectly for v4 . 
  i suppose it 's linked to `` i work here '' on uk - there 's lots of poles in uk , and many of them are pretty racist , sadly . 
  not against romanians - but muslims/indians and ( less ) africans . 
  great news . 
  but i already am afraid how our gover-moron-ment ( pis ) will try to show it as ** their ** work . 
  pis already has total control over legislative , most of executive ( except local governments ) , and is crawling onto judicative now . 
  so nope , hope is lost here . 
  2019 elections will be last chance . 
   that 's , on paper , pretty simillar situation to what he had last year here in poland . 
  actually two years already . 
  however , situation was a little different . 
  first , it was `` new fresh face '' , hard working during a well done campaign , against idle incumbent , who did n't care to campaign nearly at all ( including not taking part in multicandidate debates ) before first round . 
  it was pretty much walkover . 
  in france , we have entirely crossed out incumbent , and very active different candidates . 
  trivia : czechs actually had some [ warships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_masaryk_ ( monitor % 29 ) in past . 
  and a [ navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovakian_naval_forces ) ... ok , it was actually a small riverine flotilla , but it counts . 
  yup , there is even a word for it - * szyldoza * . 
  serious problem which most people do n't seem to care about . 
  in general , we are not fans of `` common space '' , average pole prefers to carve & wall something own . 
   til some countries do n't have them actually some parts of poland do n't as well , e.g. 
  calm down , i was joking  i think the problem is not with lack of specific terms , but number of languages - both european , and `` input '' ( arabic , pashto , urdu , turkish etc. ), 
  ones - crucial because most of those names are borrowed . 
  both * niqab * and * burqa * are relatively fresh words not only for us ( europeans - who heard them ~ 20 years ago ? 
  ) , but also many muslims themselves - because in many countries these veils appeared only in 1980-90s . 
  not because muslim women did n't veil their faces previously ( they kind of did , but it was a short period - roughly 1950-70s - when whole custom was in decline ) - but because they used other types of clothing , now declining or even forgotten ( google terms like e.g. 
  globalization happened in that area too . 
   there should be some kinda established name for different styles of veils . 
  you know we are talking women & clothing here ? 
  what did you expect ? 
   but the afghan style thing that only has tiny eye holes looks like it might be safety hazard in traffic . 
  of course . 
  but i strongly doubt anybody wears it outside afghanistan / pakistan / some parts of india . 
  especially not anywhere in europe . 
  seriously , what 's with nordics and your weird cuisine ? 
  i 've seen pizza with * kiszona kapusta * once here . 
   ew , get out of here , this should be banned asap along with the pineapples !, 
  what ? 
  shrimps work great on pizza ( other seafood , however ... ), 
  egypt did n't yet . 
  and if they do , it might be interesting , because contrary to europe , such women are very visible there ( even if it 's only ~ 5 % , it would still mean at least over a 1m - compared to mere hundreds in france or germany ) . 
   unpopular opinion : it has worked okay in france in what way ? 
  on the other hand , bavarian ban is actually reasonable , as it concerns only public places .
