  french/belgian ones were total - street , park , market etc. 
  not even talking about ridiculous burkini ban . 
   that 's a niqab , it has eye holes . 
  a burqa , however , is a different matter . 
  niqab is actually often called a burqa , even in muslim countries . 
  these two names are interchangeable ( which of course leads to some confusion , e.g. 
  some people simplify it in wrong way : niqab = eyes uncovered , burqa = niqab + eyes covered ) . 
  what 's even more confusing , that afghan garment often called burqa in the west is actually called ... chadri in afghanistan . 
  on the other hand , it 's burqa in pakistan . 
  but among indian muslims , burqa could be just a long gown , not face/head cover . 
  tl ; dr kind of like pants in american/british english . 
  his approval polls are not bad , just mediocre . 
  he actually fares better than kaczy\u0144ski ( although worse than duda ) . 
  smole\u0144sk trip was managed by president 's chancellery . 
  true , pm 's one should be doing it ( according to rules ) , but they stepped aside because president did n't want pm 's involvement . 
  tusk did n't want another `` war of chair '' , not this time . 
  i have been both to kaliningrad ( and surrounding areas ) and sp ( plus visiting pushkino & gatchina ) , and tbh it still looks much worse than poland , anywhere outside `` touristy '' areas . 
  infrastructure ( even basic things like quality of pavements ) , public transport ( exception : sp metro , that one is amazing ) , assortment in shops ... sirwootalot 's comparison fits well here - i had constant flashbacks of poland ~ 20 years ago there . 
  i do n't know , maybe moscow is really better . 
  but does russia end with moscow ? 
   not really . 
  small polish towns very slightly  small russian towns . 
  except that russia is bigger and has the centralized mentality . 
  have you even seen how is russia , first hand ? 
  i did . 
  most of it looks like poland 20-30 years ago . 
   but poland has about 1/5 of russia population but when you take gdp , difference gets smaller ( to 1/3 ) . 
  exactly . 
  if po would be still in power , merkel would n't switch to `` two speeds '' camp . 
  or poland would at least have place there . 
   pis might be assholes but atleast the are extremely rational when it comes to the threat from russia unfortunately in words only . 
  best defense against russia would be an united , more deeply integated eu . 
  while pis is in favour of loose `` europe of nations '' . 
  it depends on which half of poles you ask . 
  there 's a saying `` two poles , three opinions '' . 
  25 , not 30 . 
  and we are talking about 2nd , 3rd generations here . 
  what about yugoslavians ? 
  many ex-german cities in poland were destroyed in similar shape , as k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  difference lies in fact , that we tried to rebuilt them ( mostly ) in historical shape , while soviets just demolished what was left , and built new city , not even caring about streets grid . 
  street shown in the photo above ( `` fishing village '' ) is probably first attempt to at least imitate historical architecture . 
  however , i can assure you ( first hand ) , that german past is still visible in present k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  what 's even more interesting , that its present inhabitants feel connection to it . 
  old name is quite often appearing under the vehicle plates , here is [ example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cy3lj6p.jpg ) ( notice that 's ** police car ** ; sorry for quality , i have potato camera ) . 
  there is a local beer named k\u00f6nigsberg , vodka k\u00f6nigsbergskaya , major bus company is named k\u00f6nigavto etc. 
   i think we have n't quite seen a destruction as thorough as that of k\u00f6nigsberg in europe for centuries [ errhm ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=warszawa+1945&amp;lr=&amp;safe=images&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjc4ozrgizsahwf3cwkhe-0csyq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1173&amp;bih=513 ) ... also , k\u00fcstrin . 
  and if we talk about population change , many ex-german towns in poland ( e.g. 
  in masuria ) were completely abandoned and settled anew . 
  sometimes ( lower silesia ) it took 2-3 years , but it was the same in soviet part of ostpreussen ( last german inhabitants left actually in 1947 ) . 
  of course there 's that difference , that we ( poles ) tried to `` adopt '' this cities , not eradicating their whole history ( even in cases when there was no e.g. 
  medieval slavic/polish past , although usually there was one ) . 
  while soviets said `` screw it '' , and tried to cancel pre-1945 past entirely . 
  tbh , i have to agree a little . 
  in 1991 we were coming out from a ** huge ** recession . 
  actually it was well-rooted and rising before 1939 . 
  pps won majority of local elections ( cities ) in 1939 ( which were generally free , compared to completely rigged parliamentary ones after 1935 changes ) . 
  exactly . 
  check french football team 60-80 years ago . 
  wc 1938\u00a01/22 , 1954\u00a04/22 , 1958\u00a03/22 poles ( and mostly different ones , except kopa who played two wcs ) . 
   at the same time you need to bear in mind that we were by far one of the poorest countries although one should bear in mind , that in 1991 we were only starting to recover from ~ 12 years of long recession . 
  1980s were an economical disaster here . 
  which of course made reforms easier - we were so deep in shit , that people were ready for big changes , at least in first two-three years . 
  unemployment is n't a crucial problem , low wages are . 
  you can just earn lot more in the west . 
  not conventional at least . 
  and i agree , just wanted to point out baltic fleet is not the crucial threat . 
  just curious ... have n't you considered that afd might be just a part of bigger problem ( with right-wing populism , heavy anti-imigrants stance ) we have here in eastern europe ? 
  they seem to have much higher support in ex-ddr . 
   sounds like the same treatment libdems got in the uk ... or liberty union ( unia wolno\u015bci ) in poland , 16 years ago . 
  t-55 and 62s are pretty much all out of service ( some still rusting in `` deep reserve '' ) . 
  bulk is mostly made of t-72s . 
   yet it 's now the world 's largest economy and it 's only getting more authoritarian . 
  but on the other hand , it become much more predictable in the international scene ( at least outside far east ) . 
  they involved themselves so deeply into global economy and trade , that any high-scale conflict would be dangerous to their stability . 
   their navy would likely get fucked on day one trying to leave the baltic sea . 
  majority of russian navy is based in the north ( and far east ) . 
  baltic fleet is actually second-smallest one , only bigger than caspian one . 
  [ who is jewish i shall decide . ], 
  actually he did n't ( although he used that thinking in some cases ) , at least not as original author - who was karl lueger . 
  i think one-two times a year for average urban citizen is enough . 
  one this year , two in november-december . 
  including one actually quite far from forest , casually strolling on the pavement o_o you know , according to estimates there is ~ 250k of them here . 
   is that his driver also left the scene of the crash , despite it being clearly illegal for him to do so . 
  what 's even worse - macierewicz praised him later for `` excellent driving '' . 
   pilot said he wo n't fly untill someone leaves . 
  trivia : plane was leased from airline , pilot was an experienced civilian one . 
  which meant he could say whatever he wanted , because in worst case - he 'd find job somewhere else easily . 
  plane in smolensk 2010 was military , pilots too . 
   judging by the pictures and video i have seen in the polish press , the accident has occured here , [ better picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gyxxgdo.jpg ) . 
  i might be no expert ( no license ) , but do n't these two lines mean something ... ? 
  and that 's it . 
  pis have strong core electorate , but no chance to go above 50 % ( which would be a minimum to get constitutional majority , in good - for them - conditions ) . 
  at best they could get ~ 45 % , if they consume whole of kukiz 's support ( and notice , higher the support of pis in given poll is , lower is kukiz 's one ) . 
  that 's why they chose illegal ways to make changes . 
  it does n't help of course , but with previous government we 'd have at least a `` wild card '' . 
  or maybe germany would stay opposed to idea ( which probably made it void ) . 
  unfortunately it does n't mention our native national radicalism ( i mean onr ) . 
  problem is that this message is a `` mental tl ; dr '' . 
  hard to get that into mind of * common * man . 
  same here in poland .
