  no , it does n't . 
  many present judges , including rzepli\u0144ski , were elected in agreement , both by pis and po . 
   when you see that some countries in ue do n't even have them most major democracies do have them . 
  france , germany , italy , spain . 
  when there is no ct , usually other court ( like supreme in us ) acts instead . 
  single exception is uk , but it has no constitution , and rather unique legal system . 
   some idiots think it 's good idea to drag whole union in our internal affairs . 
  pis started it before , trying to internationalize smolensk investigation , and later undermining ( in ep ) results of local elections . 
   not only pis but pis together with larger opposition parties . 
  only that 's impossible . 
   you know this will only fuel pis ' supoort right ? 
  not necessarily . 
  it will surely strenghten its core base ( supporting no matter what ) , but they could lose new/labile voters . 
   but they do n't want german laws including germany 's definition of `` democracy '' . 
  and turkish/russian definition is better ? 
   in 1989 socialist/communist system was overthrown but not people who were ruling over it . 
  we never had true decommunization going on here . 
  stanis\u0142aw piotrowicz being a mp proves that well . 
   but instead schetyna declares they will be ` total opposition ' . 
  is it different from how pis was acting previously ? 
   and i like that comeback of national spirit . 
  there was a lot or `` national spirit ( s ) '' in europe in 1913 or 1938 . 
  it did n't end well . 
  or authors of the constitution did n't predict the situation in which the government tries to suspend constitutional tribunal by the act of parliament , without the constitutional majority . 
  nevertheless : i 'm not a constitutional lawyer , thereso i do n't feel competent enough to judge this dispute . 
  that 's why i incline into opinion of professionals . 
  and majority of them - e.g. 
  law faculties of major universities , or ( government-invited ) venetian commission - agree that it 's ct who 's right here . 
  tell me , which constitutionalists ( in meanwhile ) supports government in their acting ? 
  previous point : `` judgments of the ct ( ... ) shall be required to be ** immediately ** published '' . 
  because of d'hondt & thresholds . 
  according to pis , two pms meeting in four eyes ( tusk and putin talked in sopot on september 1st , 2009 - outdoors , in open view ) = `` weird stuff '' . 
  of course , kaczy\u0144ski or szyd\u0142o could n't do so - as they both do n't speak any foreign language ... 
  that 's three more than american senators backing pis policy . 
   why do n't you read constitution and make up your mind yourself ? 
  did you ? 
  article 190 is pretty clear here . 
  thank you , corrected . 
  that 's what pis say . 
  everybody else disagree . 
  may be not doomed , but sadly - i ca n't see it happening soon . 
  ignoring the judgment of cc . 
   best friends 4 ever :-) yeah , great suicide pact . 
   no , it does n't , quit being so dramatic . 
  i meant in longer perspective . 
  of course it wo n't happen in weeks or months , but decades . 
   the moment some german or french politician decides what happens in this country that 's the thinking we should avoid ( of course naturally , not by some laws ) . 
  less of `` german '' , `` french '' , or `` hungarian '' , more of `` european '' . 
  and in these years kremlin used the wreck ( not giving it back ) to play polish internal politics , to ** fuel ** whole affair . 
   of course it is n't , the attempts at integration already went too far and it 's causing much problems for everyone involved . 
  it 's exactly the other way - it 's not working because these attempts stopped . 
  i confess to pun it consciously . 
  it should be . 
  more , it ** must ** become one . 
  present state of eu is n't working , it 's either further integration , or breaking apart . 
   not an official position , however some pis officials ( including ** marshal of the senate ** ) are calling to [ imprison him ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,19900357,olejnik-pyta-o-tuska-karczewski-jestem-przeciwnikiem-kary.html ) . 
  previous government did n't ignore or break courts ' decisions ( not even only constitutional one ) . 
  they tried , but folded in front of judgments . 
  pis crossed this line , more than once , and is still doing it . 
   but why would the eu discuss polish internal affairs in the first place ? 
  poland is part of eu , so polish internal affairs should be eu 's affairs as well . 
  it 's like uk parliament/government discussing e.g. 
  scottish affairs . 
  or us and texas . 
   i remain somewhat optimistic . 
  it depends on how opposition would go to next elections ( 2019 ) . 
  if major `` centre '' parties ( nowoczesna , po , psl , nowacka 's ? 
  new left ) will form an ** electoral coalition ** , they should easily win gaining the winner 's bonus seats . 
  however , if they form separate lists ... pis could win again . 
  being democratically elected does n't allow you to break the law . 
  unless you have enough seats to change the constitition - which pis has n't . 
   an independent international investigation should have been held . 
  so why pis is n't declaring it ? 
   the smolensk incident is still not properly investigated , russia is blocking it . 
  russia never blocked access of polish investigators to the wreck . 
  they are using it ( not giving back ) as a tool in playing the pis , but it has nothing to do with the investigation . 
   to see a group of people calling for foreign intervention against their own country because of a domestic issue . 
  like pis after smolensk catastrophe ? 
  or after last communal elections ? 
  also , eu is not `` foreign '' . 
   and kukiz supports them on this matter as well . 
  not exactly , however , kukiz proposal is different than rest of opposition , so in the end he supports neither . 
  which is consistent with his `` f ** k the system '' program . 
  pis policy is weakening poland 's position in eyes of west ( both eu and us ) , which could leave as alone against russia . 
  so it 's consistent with putin 's agenda ( weakening the europe ) . 
  pis might be anti-russian , but their policy is pro-kremlin - although they probably do n't even realize that . 
  it 's like targowica in 18th century - wanting to preserve independence , but in reality helping russia to take it away . 
   the question is , how will poland feel when their govt follows their hungarian counterparts into selling to country to russia ? 
  there is a difference : while orban 's working with putin quite openly , pis is vocally unfriendly to russia . 
  however , their policy ( in short : weakening the eu ) is consistent with putin 's agenda , so effectively they are his ** useful idiots ** . 
  pis is acting like lemmings , blind to being ~ ~ suicidous ~ ~ suicidal . 
   have there ever been suicide bombers that were n't muslim ( apart from japanese kamikaze pilots ) ? 
  of course tamil ltte . 
  also , kurdish pkk fighters ( including women ) did some suicide attacks against turkish military . 
  kurds are muslim , but pkk is actually a non-religious organization ( radical left wingers ) . 
   its a political standard to start sh . . storm about something that is controversial like abortion not in this case , pis does n't need another front . 
  it 's an initiative of pro-life lobby + church , which both know that pis does n't have a real choice here . 
  you underestimate human ability to malice and denounciation . 
   ouch ... a very particular solution to demographic problems ... 
  it 's not because of that .
