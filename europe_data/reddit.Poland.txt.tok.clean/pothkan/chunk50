  but you did . 
  to sweden . 
  not `` happens '' , it 's frequent . 
  this job is already done by our government anyway . 
   `` kaczynski told polish media that a so-called two-speed europe would lead to the `` breakdown , and in fact the liquidation , of the eu in its current sense . '' '', 
  i agree . 
  problem is , that it 's ** his fault ** we are left behind in `` second speed '' . 
  he would n't have kaczy\u0144ski 's power over the party . 
  and control over the president ( there are already numerous signs they hate each other - but as long as kaczy\u0144ski controls them both , it does n't mean anything ) . 
  it would n't change anything . 
  and kaczy\u0144ski does n't travel a lot . 
  you wish . 
  it 's got to be second moldova . 
   who did not do or say anything controversial . 
  he said few such things , but i 'd agree he is very * mild * , compared to rest of his party . 
  thing is , that divide happens ** inside the eastern europe ** . 
  we are divided ourselves . 
  and tbh , this division comes into west as well . 
  are le pen or wilders different from kaczy\u0144ski ? 
  orban is using kaczy\u0144ski as a bait - since pis mess nobody is interested in his shady politics . 
  on the other hand , he indeed is much more reasonable politician . 
  also , notice that hungarian-polish relations under po were actually cordial as well , it seems orban and tusk have some sympathy for each other . 
   it will probably go down the same way as ukraine , except russia will be on the other side . 
  exactly . 
  by - iso code for belarus ; - \u0445\u043e\u0434 from russian \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434 ` exit ' . 
  if i 'd have to choose between le pen and macron ( or fillon , juppe , or actually even hollande or sarkozy ) , choice would be obvious . 
  and i strongly hope it will be so for majority of french . 
  but here situation is different : yeah , lukashenka is bad guy . 
  but helping him would screw another , ** much worse ** one . 
  but i agree , that abolishment of death penalty should be an unconditional requirement , before anything else . 
  realpolitik . 
  bad for putin = good for eu . 
  this . 
  while lukashenka is a dictator to his people , he was never an ** external threat ** . 
  no surprise . 
  lukashenka got afraid after seeing what putin did ( and still does ) in ukraine . 
  and while we can agree * bat ` ka * is a crooked bastard , we should still be open towards him . 
  because everything bad for putin is good for united europe . 
   have fun with your exceptionialism . 
  i really , really do n't . 
   choice is yours . 
  ~ 1000 days left . 
  short response : you are right above . 
  but where you are n't , is saying polish government = all poles and whole poland . 
  they won with only 37 % , and their support declined a little ( it 's around 30-35 % now ) . 
  support of pis , even with addition of kukiz 15 , roughly equals support of anti-pis . 
  we are not hungary or turkey , where fidesz and akp have real majority with , over 60 % support . 
  so could you at least consider ** waiting ** , until we sort our mess ? 
   while they still expect huge amounts of money at least from the second state i really , really do n't like to play this card ( because it 's overused by pis ) , but let 's be sincere : ** you owe ** ( d ) us . 
  however , i agree - this should n't be excuse for our lack of solidarity during refugee crisis . 
  because that was no matter of money , but ** principles ** . 
  as a pole , i was - and still am - ashamed of that . 
   is that a supposed pun ? 
  nope , they are serious . 
  plus it will be said that she met with polish opposition ( not mentioning they are cdu 's partner in epp , which makes such relations a routine ) , at a ** german embassy ** , surely plotting something * bad * for poland . 
  i miss times , when visit of german chancellor was a regular , routine thing here , not some `` breakthrough '' . 
  we already had good relations , if we need to fix them now , it means someone ** spoiled ** them . 
  of course , i exaggerate a little . 
  but only a little . 
  and it concerns rhetorics , not deeds themselves . 
  maybe we should . 
  as a whole eu , of course . 
  just a reminder , trade statistics ( 2015 ) : * germany --  poland $ 42,886 m * germany < -- poland $ 52,261 m * germany --  russia $ 24,786 m * germany < -- russia $ 33,338 m you are our 1st trade partner , we are among your top 10 . 
  russia is much lower . 
  and you should really consider , whether it 's worth to depend on man like putin . 
  yeah , we have morons now in government , but 1 . they are still much better than him , 2 . they can lose next elections ( which you ca n't say about uncle vova ) . 
  hey , i agree with merkel here . 
  pis = pzpr + nd . 
   good relations with russia are in principle in germany 's interest . 
  why ? 
   while the egoistic national view has won in poland pis won with only 37 % votes , it 's less than po alone had in 2007 and 2011 . 
  they are ** relative majority ** . 
  it 's not about solidarno\u015b\u0107 , but that merkel implied here similarities between pis and 1980s commies . 
  because unfortunately it worked few times in recent time . 
  tradition ? 
   \u015aure stop stealing rightful polish letters !, 
  there is one crucial factor . 
  farage does n't have blood on his hands . 
  he did n't wage ethnic cleansing . 
  he did n't faked terrorist attacks to boost his support . 
  he did n't jailed or even killed his political opponents . 
  and i 'm sure he would n't steal as much money , even if he would be able to . 
  moldovan or antarctic one ? 
  i guess both . 
  but no pastries ? 
  or even a kie\u0142basa party ( in 201 cases ) :|, 
   but we each weigh 400 lbs so trump fulfilled his promise , and made america ( ns ) great . 
  or at least ... yuuuge . 
   erdogan would be gone if we joined the eu right now . 
  being inside eu is n't blocking pis from dismantling polish democracy ( sure , they have n't reached recep 's `` levels '' ) . 
   the moment russian troops cross the polish border is the moment the whole european economy goes down the drain . 
  the moment russian troops cross the eu border , nobody cares about gdp or exchange rates . 
  it 's world war iii . 
   big exceptions are france and uk [ hey !, 
   is that in 1683 they pretty much saved europe from being completely dominated by the ottomans knowing how austria `` thanked '' us ~ 100 years later ... we should n't care . 
  and it was ~ 150 years before they * shocked the world by the depth of [ their ] ingratitude * ( during crimean war ) . 
  i commented quote `` one of the ** oldest in europe ** , perhaps the second oldest '' . 
  sure , i do n't deny that . 
  i was challenging `` second oldest '' - this list shows ~ 15 older universities . 
  to be honest , it was rather quantity  quality .
