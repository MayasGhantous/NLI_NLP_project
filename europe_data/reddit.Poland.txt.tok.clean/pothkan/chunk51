  lots of paintings , books ( e.g. 
  copernicus ' library ) , armour . 
  but if you need a cool artifact [ here is one ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:h%c3%a4strustning_-_livrustkammaren_-_72697.tif ) . 
   it 's a bit of a meme . 
  some things should n't be memed , ** ever ** . 
   poland jut feels much more like home when compared to other countries trivia : i used to procrastinate on geoguessr . 
  and one time i got a rural area , which looked suspiciously polish , i moved towards some houses ( which looked even more polish ) , then landed in some suburbian area . 
  it was outside kaunas o_o, 
   this is only for the western poland . 
  nope . 
   every time i need to select my country in a dropdown menu at least you do n't have that problem [ with language ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xqopwur.png ) . 
  gib back stolen loot !, 
  ( from 350 years ago ), 
   the krakow university is one of the oldest in europe , perhaps the second oldest ? 
  not really , it 's circa 18-19th . 
  lots of older universities in italy , some in england ( including two famous ones ) , spain . 
  however , it 's second oldest in central & northern europe ( including germany ) , after charles university of prague . 
  ** why am i downvoted ? 
  ** it 's not second oldest in europe !, 
   fillon/macron in 2nd turn would be a great election . 
  and great `` fu '' moment to present alt-right wave . 
  still , i suppose it would be one of them against marine , and hopefully repeat of `` everybody vs le pen '' election . 
  because her victory would be a disaster for our continent . 
  [ mi dulce presidente ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyaw5oqwupu&amp;list=plf1c307c3da1b0a93 ), 
   this is even funnier if you speak spanish on the other hand , many references are clear to poles only , 
   nope , they pretty much got their asses kicked . 
  soviets won ... but it was a definition of pyrrhic victory . 
  upvoted for otava yo . 
  few examples from poland : * [ karczmareczko godna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fihm8sad01s ) ( some balkanic influence in music ) * [ siadaj siadaj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhwnymeqos ) ( polish folk wedding song , clip made in poland , but band is from ukraine ) * [ to i hola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujnz_cpidh0 ) - this one is n't even modernized , it 's classic folk ; if you 're interested other songs by this group ( rokiczanka ) * r.u.t.a. 
  - a musical project , reinventing old peasant protest songs ; two best examples : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgyanxfd4yg ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwxsld-fiu ), 
   managed to learn the language because nobody needs to . 
  nearly every dutch speaks english or german anyway . 
  or eastern poland . 
   was trying to create a french hegemony in europe thing is , that napoleonic rule was / would be an improvement for many european countries ( not uk , which was already quite democratic ) . 
  especially in matter of law and administration . 
  read about treaty of amiens . 
  and check * perfide * - who ** broke ** it . 
  dying light ? 
  and lately this war of mine , although it might be too niche ... 
  as i said , it 's good reading - considering style , flow etc. 
  and he 's quite honest about hardships of being a front soldier . 
  but then there are some racist etc. 
  rants , so ... 
  i 'd say it 's recommended , if you are a military/history afficionado . 
  his war diaries were published in polish . 
  some our natio-lol-morons love him ( because he fought with soviets ) . 
  in my opinion , he was just another nazi ... but i have to admit , that he had `` good pen '' . 
  it 's good reading . 
  tl ; dr very bad guy with good publicity . 
  waffles , comic books , frites , good beer ( including kriek ) , waterloo , rubens , german shortcut to france ( twice ) , congo genocide , degrelle , paedophiles , waffles . 
   we helped defeat napoleon , sure nothing to be proud of . 
  guy was better than most of european rulers in this time . 
   media in spain says almost nothing about portugal so portugal is spain 's slovakia ? 
  tbh , is n't it valid for majority of metal scene ? 
  maybe except russia ? 
  ^ ( tbh i googled it ), 
  absolutely halal !, 
  is there any explanation why greece ranks so high here ? 
   can not imagine how polish metal would sound like . 
  overwhelming majority of polish metal bands sing in english anyway . 
  it depends on place . 
  but klaipeda or kaunas , not really . 
  do many andorrans really speak spanish ? 
  not catalan ? 
  tbh , huey , dewey and louie 's results are inflated by knowledge of russian ( among minority and +50 natives ) . 
  and luxemburg or malta are bilingual ... 
  so i guess danes , swedes & ~ ~ swamp germans ~ ~ dutch are true winners here . 
  also , hungary - seriously ? 
  how do you communicate with external world ? 
  nobody else speaks ~ ~ klingonian ~ ~ hungarian . 
  i 'm not sure if we can endure such amount of sisu , perkele and liquorice . 
  ^ ( but i would n't mind some koskenkorva ! ), 
  let 's hope 2017 will be better than this year , and europe shall get back on track !, 
   but they never have any gristle there are numerous kinds of gristleless sausages available , at least here ( pl ) . 
  you just need to find some `` proven '' brands . 
  and some dry ones can be kept for a long time even outside fridge . 
   but here sausages are notorious for containing very little meat it was a problem in poland about a decade ago , but thankfully it changed . 
  however , there is a problem with mixed meat things , e.g. 
  `` sausages with veal '' or `` with venison '' , which actually include only 2-3 % of said meat ( and rest is regular pork or beef ) . 
  glory to polstotzka !, 
   that is what they say but it makes no sense of course it 's connected to religion , but not necessarily family . 
  i already mentioned converts , and there are also repeated cases of muslim moderate or even progressive parents - where mother was wearing hijab only , or even no scarf at all . 
  at least read chapters about influence ( pages 47-54 in major french report , 46-61 in uk one ) : `` fathers ' reactions to the decision to wear the veil '' - positive 15 % , negative 38 % ( unknown/indifferent 47 % ) ; mothers ' - positive 12 % , negative 62 % ( !, 
  ) ; husbands ' - au contraire , positive 46 % , negative 30 % ( however , it 's probable that many such women chose husband based on his attitude here , while one ca n't choose her/his parents ) . 
  longer quote :  conflicts inside families arising from the adoption of the niqab by a daughter are one of the most striking findings of the research . 
  the testimonies from many interviewees , particularly the youngest , suggest they find themselves in open conflict with their families when they start wearing the niqab . 
  knowing that their parents would oppose it , many started wearing the niqab secretly . 
  as with a number of husbands , some parents were not necessarily opposed to the full-face veil but mainly feared that their daughter would be assaulted for wearing it . 
  uk results are more tilted into `` positive attitude '' ( in family ) , which is explicable with lower level of intolerance ( no ban there ) , which leads to lower level of fear mentioned above . 
  in general : it seems indoctrination problem lies not with families , but with online activity , especially various orthodox/salafi organisations ( some saudi-founded ) . 
   since only muslim women wear it notice quite high number of converts ( in all reports ) . 
  my point is not about statistics , but that existence unsolicited niqab wearers are a ** fact ** . 
   since only muslim women wear it , the instructions of religious parents and external `` educators '' clearly has an influence on the child . 
  you clearly have n't read these reports . 
  family has secondary or even no meaning . 
  mosques , some . 
  and there is high importance of online `` education '' , and influence of other such women ( also often online ) . 
  nevertheless : there are different reasons , different backgrounds etc. 
  behind every veil is an individual human , even if it does n't look like that . 
  pretty much everybody except serbia .
