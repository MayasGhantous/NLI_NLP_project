  you should count soviet ambassadors too . 
  one was assassinated in [ lausanne in 1923 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vatslav_vorovsky ) , another in [ poland in 1927 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyotr_voykov ) , both by white emigres . 
   can i see that survey ? 
  sorry for late response , i was busy . 
  * france [ major report from 2011 ] ( https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/a-unveiling-the-truth-20100510_0.pdf ) + [ shorter post-ban one ] ( https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/after-the-ban-experience-full-face-veil-france-20140210.pdf ) * [ great britain ] ( https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/behind-veil-20150401.pdf ) * [ denmark ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537903.2013.750834 ) * you might be also interested in video showing some such women 's comments , also from france : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nex9lm4vqcm ) ( mostly until 3:00 and since 12:30 ; skip non-muslim woman in between , she 's some weird artist ), 
  poland did not surrender in 1939 . 
   how likely is it that she is veiling herself out of her own free will and without childhood indoctrination ? 
  here in west , pretty likely . 
  limited survey made among such women in france and denmark proved that most of them do it on their own will , often even against their parents . 
  there is also over-representation of converts . 
  of course , surely there are also cases of coercion or family pressure . 
  both things happen . 
   and wearing a burqa gives exactly that statement , that she is holier than me . 
  as above : get over it . 
  do you really care what she would think about you ? 
   strangely this is only used when we are talking about immigration of muslims . 
  not really . 
  on similar scale , it concerns e.g. 
  roma people . 
  or on smaller , polish , romanian etc. 
  immigrants in uk , sweden or netherlands . 
  difference in cultural norms is much smaller there of course , but still - it happens . 
   i am guessing that circles back to that secularization happens it definitely happens . 
  question is - how high is rate . 
   you mean as in `` do nothing '' ? 
  promote desired behaviour , but do n't chicane of ban undesired one ( of course , as long as it 's not something harmful to other people , unsolicited , unlawful etc. ) . 
  tl ; dr ** carrot , not stick ** . 
  on example of niqabi woman : give her info about her laws ( both state freedoms , and opinions of muslim scholars saying it 's not obligatory ) , contact to suitable ngo , police . 
  protect her if she ask for help . 
  but if she 's veiling on her own will , do n't mind it . 
  and if she wants to participate in public life ( e.g. 
  work ) , allow or even support it . 
  because what could come from forcing her to reclude , or take veil off against her wishes ? 
  another example : burkini and schoolgirls . 
  is n't better to allow them to wear it ( as long as no coercion is noticed ) , and participate in swimming lessons , gymnastics etc. ? 
  there would be no integration at all , if such people will feel unwelcome . 
   it affects the whole world and especially warmer climates will become warmer . 
  yeah , but desertification ( is it a word ? ), 
  happens mostly there . 
  read the * hunger * by mart\u00edn caparr\u00f3s . 
   we ca n't integrate beyond a certain number of new arrivals . 
  number we ca n't integrate beyond is so high , it wo n't happen . 
  although i agree , that we should take gradual steps . 
  plus remember , that problem with integration lies on ** both sides ** . 
   people are coming because of our wealth , not because of our values . 
  point of view changes with point of standing ( i hope you get it , it 's crude translation ) . 
   but we should stop normalizing it . 
  there is difference between saying `` that 's wrong , you should n't do it '' and `` you ca n't do it , i forbid you '' . 
  nobody serious would force you to consider e.g. 
  niqab as something normal and desirable . 
  thing is , we should just ** get over ** things like that . 
   and put a ban on bikini ads you ca n't compare limited ( it concerned city bus ) ban of ** ads ** of given clothing , with ban of ** wearing ** another one . 
  first one is commercial topic , second - matter of ** personal freedom ** . 
  what do you think about alcohol ads ? 
  and what about selling and drinking it ? 
  see the difference ? 
   religious believers and that will only get worse with global warming . 
  this affects mostly sub-saharan africa . 
  which is only partially muslim . 
  although tbh , many christians there are n't really less regressive ...  but we are seeing a constant instream of religious believers we can do it . 
  our values are stronger and more attractive . 
   the views on unbelievers , women and other non-conforming groups in islam are dangerous so should we start punishing people based on their views ? 
  it 's a very slippery road ...  but that is not how believes work , especially religion . 
  i 'm sure that for each salafi , or even convert , you would have one ex-muslim or entirely secularized one . 
  true , but it should cover myth of `` demographic bomb '' . 
  rate of secularization or assimilation is hard to examine , but there are numerous individual examples . 
  mayors of london or rotterdam . 
  or half of swiss football team . 
   do you think these problems of aggressive beliefs would prevail in , say , a hindu community ? 
  or a buddhist one ? 
  maybe not on the same scale , but ... yeah , they would . 
  lots of social problems in india , including reprehensible rapes , with some very loud cases . 
  and repeating anti-muslim riots . 
  just look at myanmar and burmese nationalism . 
  there were even active monks among leaders of , again , anti-muslim riots there . 
  also , think about high crime and violence , and look at some christian countries of latin america , especially central . 
   do you have any numbers on that ? 
  birth rate goes down with every next generation of immigrants . 
  turkish women in germany in 1970s ( nearly all were 1st gen ) had 5,5 kids on average , in 2010 ( many 2nd , 3rd gen ) it 's was 2,2 . 
  now it 's definitely even less , although probably still above `` native '' rate . 
  ** convergence ** . 
  same happened with south asians in uk . 
  depending on what you consider an `` islamization '' . 
  precisely , i ask about scale . 
  because yeah , it 's happening and real . 
  but on the other hand , it 's hugely overestimated as a threat . 
  violent/terrorist islamists are ** dangerous minority ** ( i emphasise both words ) . 
  what we have to do , is oversee and observe any reactionary or suspicious groups ( not only muslim , but also our own kin ) . 
  but without repressing non-violent people , who just want to live in their weird way - as long as there is no coercion , maybe even solicition , and most of all , no state law broken ( but it does n't allow us to make new , chicane laws - like ridiculous burkini ban in france ) . 
   why is there such a high correlation though between muslim populations and this behaviour ? 
  regressive views does n't necessarily lead to crime or violent behaviour . 
  compare muslims in france to ones in uk . 
  plus , ** no community is monolyth ** . 
  there are regressives , salafists , even tiny minority of terrorists - but there are also progressives . 
  can you honestly say there are no reactonary morons among your people ? 
  because i can , about mine ( poles ) . 
  why ca n't we judge people on their individual deeds ( and misdeeds ) , not ethnicity or religion ? 
   well the religion adds an extra layer of problems of course , it 's exactly that - another layer . 
  but not the main reason .
