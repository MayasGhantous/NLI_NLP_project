   france , belgium , sweden , england , etc. 
  which are poor shitholes full of ... 
  i hope you get my point . 
   demographic bomb coming down the pipeline . 
  `` demographic bomb '' is a myth ( which btw is used by politicians in different parts of the world since 19th century , and actually happened ... to the moment , nowhere ) . 
  mostly because of simple convergence ( birth rate gets lower with every next generation of immigrants ) , but also partial assimilation , and plain diversity among them . 
   the po mp was warned several times but did n't listen . 
  he did ** exactly ** what kuchci\u0144ski wanted - hid #wolnemedia card ( showing which was of course a big offense / s ) . 
  he was devoiced just after started to say his regular , budget-related statement . 
   he was up there to provoke an escalation in the first place . 
  so what , mere presence of opposition is a provocation ? 
  yeah , because germany is a poor shithole full of crime , hunger , and wild hordes of slave-raping * janjawis * . 
   and if po were at power those three branches would be at the same spot as they were now . 
  `` if '' against `` is '' . 
  po ruled 8 years , and did n't break or disobey ct rulings even once . 
  they tried to ** bend the rules ** . 
  while pis is openly ** breaking ** them . 
  this crisis would n't happen , if kuchci\u0144ski ( speaker of parliament , pis ) did n't [ devoice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rhupqm7jw ) szczerba ( opposition mp , po ) at the rostrum . 
  so if it was provocation , kuchci\u0144ski would have to cooperate here . 
  which is of course nonsense . 
   but in my little society ( friends , colleagues , family ) 90 % of people i meet has very similar idea as me . 
  and in mine at least 80 % thinks something entirely contrary . 
  which only proves , how divided , polarized and `` bubbled '' society we are now . 
  also , revise trianon . 
  am i doing it right ? 
  including those voted in by pis ? 
  and who would choose new ones ? 
   and he is often a bit too emotional imho eu politics needs more emotional politicians . 
  technocrats make it looking detached . 
   what can thay do , when they had the all mess prepared by former govenment ? 
  simple : implement tribunal 's judgment from december 2015 . 
   which government ? 
  present of course . 
   you must admitt that they started all the mess . 
  why do you trying to excuse that swindlers ? 
  fact that po started this mess does n't allow pis to make another , much bigger one . 
  it 's like saying it 's ok to rob a bank , because somebody stole an apple . 
  i ask about 1970-80s of course . 
  seriously , hungarians , stahp . 
  you make our slavic family looking easy to learn . 
  the problem here is more about the ghetto itself ( problems like lack of social perspectives , high crime , feeling of being left out ) , than religion itself . 
  it 's more or less the same in any other similar neighborhood of big cities . 
  is scampia in naples any different ? 
  or calton in glasgow ? 
  except that people there are not muslims , but `` native europeans '' ? 
  timmermans is my favourite eurocrat . 
  and proved friend of poland , as he 's meritorious in preserving memory about gen. maczek and his army . 
  fact , that he lacks [ crazy antics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2qrarlze-o&amp;t=27s ) of juncker , or scary teeth of verhofstadt , helps here too ... 
   have you got the whole parliament debate in english ? 
  timmermans is rare exception , most of emps speak in their native languages . 
  there is english translation available , of course . 
  his opening statement is good too . 
   po was doing same things . 
  that 's what government wants you to believe . 
   po was doing same thing with media with `` wprost '' . 
  wprost was part of anti-wire leak investigation . 
  pis now is restricting media 's access in parliament . 
   po was changing judges just as pis . 
  they tried to vote ** two ** judges before time , but tribunal cancelled that ( we do n't know what po would do then , because pis got power in the meantime - but to all other ct rulings in 2007-15 , po folded ) . 
  while pis ** blocked ** three ( other ) judges , who were chosen ** completely legally ** . 
   watch tvn ( station owned by po ) tvn is owned by an american media corporation . 
   are you fucking kidding ?? 
  no hunger in poland in the early '80s ? 
  hunger , no . 
  ** malnutrition ** , yes . 
  maybe better let 's not mention anything about `` camps on our soil '' . 
  people could get wrong associations again . 
  brother of my grandfather fought with soviets ... problem is , that it was on the eastern front in 1942 . 
   _ guy  nauczy\u0142am i get mixed signals here . 
  it was the only 100 % local polish family car in mass production . 
  warszawa was licensed pobeda ( which itself was copy of some american car ) , and later fiat 125/126p , and polonez , were either licensed italian cars , or involved lots of italian design . 
   shops only stocked vinegar and pickled gherkins . 
  not really , they stocked some edible food as well ( except meat , especially anything at least decent - that was a major problem ) . 
  but if you took a photo later than let 's say ~ 10 am , it was only vinegar & gherkins - because everything else was ** already gone ** . 
  my point : there was no ** hunger ** in commie-poland ( maybe except first 2-3 years just after the ww2 ) . 
  but there were constant problems with anything above basic needs ( not only things like coffee , good meat , exotic fruits ; but even sugar or lemons ) , and quality of food was sometimes poor . 
  which sometimes led to ** malnutrition ** . 
  but on the other hand , there were periods when you could e.g. 
  have fresh buns and milk every morning , behind your door . 
   lol this is n't a `` communist shithole '' thing , it 's a `` rural area of europe 30 years ago '' thing . 
  problem is in 1980s poland it was n't `` rural area '' , it was everywhere . 
  supply of meat in state shops was very bad , so people based on black market , places like in the picture and family in the countryside . 
  my granddad ( surgeon in 300k city ) drove half the country , every 3-4 months , to his brother , and returned with trunk full of fresh meat . 
  it 's just like in the us . 
  trump did n't win by presenting himself as good candidate . 
  but by making clinton look equally bad , or even worse . 
  there was/is '' ** they 're the same ** '' factor in both cases . 
  otto ii , actually . 
  otto iii was buddy of boles\u0142aw . 
  probably first one . 
  but tbh , she 's a little of second as well . 
  yeah , but they have no soviet bayonets now , 
  i think eu should impose political ( not economical ) sanctions upon poland . 
  `` haider treatment '' plus suspension in european council . 
  of course , if it would be possible - but is n't . 
  tbh , i sometimes wonder if we were n't a trial ground before the brexit and usa 2016 . 
  we still do n't know , who really was responsible for cable leaks in 2014 and spring 2015 ( `` stonoga files '' ) , which helped duda to win first round . 
   was it not clear to the polish people that this would happen when they voted for this government ? 
  not really . 
  they based their campaign ( very polished and modern , btw ) on social issues ( and anti-immigrant fear ) , and all controversial people like macierewicz , paw\u0142owicz , or even kaczy\u0144ski , were pretty much hidden .
