  unless you were smart enough and remembered 2005-07 , you could be easily charmed . 
   is law and order still popular after all that shit ? 
  if the election took place today , would it win again ? 
  rather not . 
  main opposition ( po/n/psl ) would probably go under joined list , which would diminish difference between results ( or even give victory ) . 
  of course much depends on result of minor parties , especially kukiz and left ( both razem and nowacka 's tent ) . 
  but imho at worst pis would have to get into very unstable coalition with kukiz . 
  not exactly . 
  it 's roughly 50/50 division ( pis vs opposition , plus potential allies of both sides ) . 
  as long as opposition will go to elections under joined list ( which seems very probable now , both petru and schetyna were rather positive about this topic since few weeks , and yesterday will definitely strengthen it ) , pis should lose . 
  if left ( razem , nowacka etc. ), 
  manage to get into parliament , it would be even better . 
  at worst , pis will need kukiz to govern , and it would be much more unstable coalition , than even 2005-07 one . 
   i ca n't deal with another 4 years of this shit . 
  early election pls and what , stab-in-the-back legend for pis , and their return few years later ? 
  we have to survive whole 4 years . 
  people will get mad at them , but it needs time . 
   poland trending towards an illiberal democracy . 
  same path hungary is taking . 
  look who 's talking ... sadly :(, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/uxxlj30lz-a?t=170 ), 
   there is not a person in poland that would welcome european interference in our affairs i would . 
  so what , am i a * volksfeind * now ? 
  luckily , this time they have no strong support of external * bayonets * . 
   the eu should be able to make a country candidate for expulsion . 
  expulsion - no . 
  but suspension ( mostly of political power , without eu citizenship privileges for people ) , yeah . 
   at this point it 's valid to talk about democracy in poland being abolished . 
  not yet . 
  it is a step in this direction , but actual breaking point would happen if they try to mess with election process . 
  gerrymandering , or restricting opposition campaign . 
  and if more people have such revelation , there will be hope . 
  which is actually good news for us here . 
  if kaczy\u0144ski had orban 's level of tactics and diplomacy , i 'd be very worried . 
  but he 's reckless and stubborn , in a bolshevik way . 
   kaczy\u0144ski loves to surround himselfe with halfwits there are pretty much five types of people in pis : * spineless ( majority , e.g. 
  duda ) * faithful halfwits ( numerous category , examples : b\u0142aszczak , suski , kuchci\u0144ski ) * cuckoolanders ( e.g. 
  i 'm afraid more and more people will share such hope . 
  i 'm getting worried . 
  and it fits like a glove in our case . 
  polish left-right division is about worldview etc. , not economy . 
  except openly pro-government `` defiant '' ( * niepokorne * ) media . 
  and of course , rydzyk . 
  oh , the irony . 
   veiling does n't have anything to do with feminism not with our definition of feminism . 
   it happens on a large scale in western countries too . 
  again : punish forcing , not custom itself . 
  my point is : if we want to preserve ( western ) civilization based on freedom ( including personal one ) , we ca n't prosecute things ** we do n't like ** . 
  as long as they do n't harm anyone else ( and no , `` hurt feelings '' do n't count ) , and are unsolicited . 
  quoting yourself :  the shah ordered his police to rip off women 's veils . 
  still , it 's not really that what was wrong with shah 's regime . 
  only that it was undemocratic ( even compared to modern iran ) , corrupt , and supressing all opposition . 
  plus of course dependent foreign policy , which angered many iranians . 
  post-1979 iran is kind of like post-1959 cuba . 
  yeah , castro was a dictator with blood on hands . 
  but was he really worse than his predecessor ? 
  same here . 
  that 's why i wonder what would happen , if more democratic politicians like mosaddegh had chance to rule there . 
  or at least if shah was less authoritiarian - something like in pre-1978 afghanistan . 
  both king zahir and president daoud took more small steps . 
   the shah 's or khomeini 's ? 
  neither ( unless i would born in privileged family in first one ) . 
  that 's the point . 
  we ca n't justify one dictature with fear of different one . 
   her family , her community , her husband will force her . 
  surely , it happens , especially in middle east , but there are also women who want to veil even against wishes of their family . 
  especially in west . 
  call it how you like ( youth rebel , neophite zeal ) , but it happens . 
  actually , imho in some cases it might be somehow distorted type radical feminism ( compare bras burning , avoiding make up , male clothes ) . 
  research on veiling women ( in france and denmark ) proved , that most of them do it on their own will . 
  that 's why we should punish not veiling itself , but ** forcing to veil ** , whenever it happens . 
  there is plenty of interviews with veiling women on youtube , just try to search and listen . 
  [ good example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nex9lm4vqcm ) ( expert opinions are a little biased , so you can skip them - or just watch 3 first minutes and since 12:30 ) . 
  and these are niqab-wearing women , it 's probably even more unsolicited in hijab case . 
  as long as religious dictations are n't above state law , and there 's freedom of religion ( or lack of it ) - i see no problem . 
  if woman wants to veil , state have to ** allow ** her = if woman does n't want to veil , state ca n't ** force ** her . 
  simple . 
   the shah ordered his police to rip off women 's veils . 
  which was no better than making them obligatory later by islamists . 
  or maybe even worce . 
  no government should dictate , what one can or ca n't wear , things like clothing are part of personal freedom ( and yeah , i 'm talking about present europe here too ) . 
  no kvas either . 
   i wonder how are those two going to make the world great again ? 
  by power of post-truth . 
   interesting !, 
  can you as a pole understand slovak and make yourself understood if you were to travel to slovakia ? 
  yeah , kind of . 
  but i did some research ( phrase book etc. ), 
  before . 
  and had much more hard time in prague , than in bratislava . 
  tbh , polish and czech/slovakian are n't mutually intelligible . 
  vocabulary is the problem . 
  but of course , if one starts to actually learn given langauge , it gets very easy ( inside slavic family of languages ) . 
  yeah , one one hand you have problems with `` false friends '' , on the other , you easily grasp concepts unfamiliar to germanic or romance languages , like slavic grammar , especially rich declension . 
  i learned russian and croatian , and it was much easier than english ( years of learning and practice , and i probably still make mistakes ) , not even talking about german and french ( few years each , and eventually i ca n't honestly say i speak any of these two ) . 
  i need it subtitled . 
  mostly because it [ makes fun of us as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxlj30lz-a ) . 
  from pole 's perspective : slovak is much more alike . 
  czech has too many different words . 
  especially `` false friends '' .
