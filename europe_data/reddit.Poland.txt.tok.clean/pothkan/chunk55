   the driving force for the iranian revolution was to establish iran as a country to become islamic . 
  but notice , that in 1979 at first nearly ** everybody ** joined forces against shah . 
  also leftists , liberals , even communists . 
  regime was defended by marginal minority . 
  of course , islamists quickly supressed other opposition , although iraqi attack kind of helped them ( `` unifying '' nation against external agression ) . 
  problem is , that it was forced , and to be honest , involved mostly higher classes and capital . 
  we all know those `` teheran 1970 vs 2000 '' photos - they show only part of the picture . 
  things in smaller cities or even some districts of teheran were n't actually as different . 
  you ca n't announce revolution , like pahlavi tried to . 
   in 2015 , 27.5 % of live births in england and wales were from foreign born mothers this number include eu-internal migrants . 
  mostly poles . 
   the west is to blame for the saudi arabia vs iran century old rivalry ? 
  a little , yeah . 
  usa deposed iranian pm mosaddegh , who had a chance to built a democratic modern country . 
  and later supported reza shah , whose rule was authoritarian , and led to revolution . 
  and of course there is a history of anglosaxon support to ibn saud . 
  of course russia is at fault here as well , mostly because of supporting various baathist regimes . 
  not really . 
  there are numerous cases of communist or `` arab socialist '' muslim states , where actually radical islam got strong , because it was major stronghold of opposition . 
  and when it was supressed , it meant ** extremely ** harsh dictatorship . 
  azerbaijan is a relatively mild case , but look at turkmenistan or uzbekistan . 
  and syria kind of too . 
   on a more serious note , i 'd be interested to see a comparison of birth rates for muslim and non-muslim europeans . 
  it 's bigger for muslims , but difference flattens with every next generation ( convergence ) . 
  turks in germany had 5,5 per woman in 1970s ( when nearly all of them were 1st generation ) , now ( when many are 3r , 4th generation ) it 's 2,2 . 
  same with south asians in uk . 
   how lavrov is a criminal ? 
  not really a criminal , just spokesman of one . 
   they are afaik also not in danger . 
  mostly because assad 's forces there are surrounded by isis , and have no time to care about ethnic cleansing . 
  ** yet ** . 
   some countries are not capable to lead a democratic country . 
  same was told about given country 19 years ago . 
  guess which one . 
   but the mps from kukiz would simply switch to pis not all of them , but probably more than half , yeah . 
   i 've read about it in slovak newspapers . 
  is there anything online ? 
  i 'm curious how our situation is described over the tatra . 
  i mean opinion pieces , not raw news . 
  slovakian is ok , i will manage . 
  it is n't really a religious country . 
  an albanian is albanian first , faith has secondary meaning ( and there are also albanian catholics , orthodox , and of course irreligious ) . 
   but atleast it 's a very secular state and probably one of the best muslim dominated countries to live in . 
  not really . 
  high corruption , inequality , clientelism . 
  not that it has anything to do with islam . 
  if i had to give an example of `` nice '' muslim country , it would be jordan or malaysia . 
  they 're roughly something like spanish * ciudadianos * . 
  similar to po , but even more pro-eu , a little to the left ( which makes them `` core centre '' ) . 
  leader is rather uncharismatic , but some their mps are quite promising . 
   when people understand that they no longer can assembly freely , when arrests or anything start , this is exactly when they go out to protest . 
  [ exactly ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/1ey79b.jpg ) . 
  tbh , i think that if pis would stick to `` soft '' policy ( alike how they posed during campaign ) , they would easily have over 50 % support in polls now . 
   and there 's also right-wing kukiz ' 15 . 
  i 've heard that this party is more likely going to align with pis than with liberal opposition . 
  yes , but it would n't be an easy coalition . 
  kukiz does n't agree with pis in many areas ( sometimes for better , sometimes for worse ) . 
   will you follow orb\u00e1n 's hungary ? 
  fidesz has much bigger percantage of support , plus there is jobbik to right , so hungarian opposition is weak . 
  while in poland it 's roughly even . 
  remember , that orban won more than one elections with independent majority , and even constitutional one . 
  while pis won in 2015 ** barely ** , mostly thanks to many `` lost votes '' ( under the threshold ) . 
  they actually received ** less ** votes , than po in 2007 and 2011 . 
  i think there 's a good chance to oust them in 2019 , provided opposition will make a joined list ( seems probable ) . 
   pis is holding up in polls so it 's likely i would n't care about polls too much , either way . 
  definitely not three years before the election . 
  po was in the lead year before 2015 elections , and then quickly collapsed after komorowski lost first round . 
  there 's only a link to original 2015 survey ( no longer working ) , not its results . 
  where are results of previous survey ? 
  this . 
  [ ruina imperii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdkb4kt3o1w ) is amazing . 
  three kings is a different holiday , in january . 
  and no gifts are given then . 
   reminds me of the czech movie otes\u00e1nek wtf czechia . 
  probably fish bassin collapsed ? 
   hey , it tastes okay . 
  not really . 
  it became a `` traditional '' christmas dish in commie times , only because it 's easily available , being a bred fish . 
  only poor people have eaten carp in poland before the ww2 . 
  i never liked it , and have n't got it on christmas for about ten years . 
  lately we buy either zander , sturgeon , or just cod . 
  and of course cold herring prepared in different ways ( cherry is my favourite ) . 
  it was widely popular just ~ 20 years ago . 
  also , probably in 9th century parts of southern poland came under influence of greater moravia , ** slight ** christianization in slavic rite might even happen . 
  city of krak\u00f3w was probably established then . 
  however , beginning of medieval polish state ( piast dynasty ) started their way to power only in 930-940s - probably led by mieszko 's father siemomys\u0142 / ziemomys\u0142 . 
  in the north , trading emporium truso ( probably mostly baltic-prussian , but maybe also with some slavic and scandinavian influence ) , near modern elbl\u0105g , was established in 8th century . 
  it disappeared in late 11th . 
  lacking bunkers . 
  it 's an ex-commie thing , actually . 
  we are struggling to [ get out of that habit as well ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tqra_xo_wmm/umiubeewlmi/aaaaaaaabc0/xt8_r35y4im/s1600/50.png ) . 
  #kr\u0131mna\u015f ? 
  we ca n't decide who we should support - both or neither ? 
  however , there is always an option of r/poland vs r/polska war ... 
  other guy , [ however ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc97rkut8g8 ) ... 
   ah , the good old napoleon fetish of poland . 
  polish law is mostly based on napoleonic codex granted to duchy of warsaw , which was inherited by congress kingdom , and much of it survived until 1918 . 
  then it was mixed with ex-prussian and ex-austrian law . 
  and there 's [ proof ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/39/69/92/39699216ce82ce3293b2478dec920018.jpg ) !, 
  meh , [ we went 2016 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_poland ) before it was actually 2016 .
