  all this hate blinds you . 
  sure , blame germany . 
  our favorite scapegoat . 
  our society is aging rapidly , we will need fresh blood ( = hands ) soon . 
  ukrainians wo n't suffice , especially that they would leave anyway ( when eu will grant them union-wide visa-free access ) . 
  also , difference between best and next results is crucial . 
  po actually got ** more ** votes in 2007 and 2011 , than pis in 2015 , but they did n't receive independent majority , because pis was just few % below po then . 
  while in 2015 pis was way ahead of po . 
  i mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_poland#/media/file:kingdomofpoland1815.jpg ) . 
  whites of course did n't care about ex-german parts or galicia . 
  problem was land east of border above . 
   and the answer is that whites official policy on poland , ukraine and the baltics was reconquest . 
  not entirely . 
  whites recognized polish right to independence ... problem is , that only in 1815 borders . 
  and probably half of slovene . 
  it 's name of middle level school in poland as well ( age 12-15 roughly ) . 
  elementary school before that , lycaeum ( liceum ) , technical school ( technikum ) or vocational one afterwards . 
  great , so now we 're comparing who suffered more again . 
  can we have it behind us , at last ? 
   after being tossed around for a thousand years and tossing around romanians , slovakians and croats in the meanwhile . 
  try talking about smyrna and trapezount then . 
  or maybe not ... 
  i think that he was thinking that burqa & niqab are two different things . 
  while it 's actually a byword . 
   but banning them in a context of high bank robbery alert seems a good practice . 
  in the banks , yeah . 
  but in the street ? 
  burqa and niqab mean the same actually in this case . 
  whole thing that burqa means that weird afghan covering , is a myth . 
  in most muslim countries those are actually bywords . 
  what accident ? 
  previous german owner was a retiree who only drove a car to church weekly , and was crying when selling it . 
  * dobry * is quite a regular response when somebody else greets you with a * dzie\u0144 dobry * . 
   you will mention at least one bad thing that happened to you recently . 
  if the second person complains about their own shitty day in responce - you are doing it right . 
  such is daily life in eastern europe  [ relevant comic ] ( http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/2012/12/cheer-up.html ) . 
  casual ( among friends , colleagues ) ** cze\u015b\u0107 ** . 
  less often , ** czo\u0142em ** or ** serwus ** ( last one especially in ex-austrian south ) . 
  more formal ( not acquintances or people like professor , boss ) ** dzie\u0144 dobry ** ( ** dobry wiecz\u00f3r ** after ~ 17 ) . 
  plus a single hand-squeeze ( firm with another male , delicate with female ) among friends and colleagues , not only first time , but on daily basis . 
  yeah , sometimes it get ridiculous , in a `` everybody vs everybody '' way . 
  male would sometimes bow and kiss woman on her hand , but it 's limited to very formal occasions . 
  close friends will sometimes hug ( both m/m and f/m ) , especially when long unseen . 
  f/f friendship and family might also involving a one or two cheek kisses . 
  m/m - no greeting kissing . 
  not portuguese , but my city had [ two cods ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/pol_gdynia_coa.svg/657px-pol_gdynia_coa.svg.png ) . 
  and a sword . 
  so in basic , a * zakuska * . 
  google `` latvian jokes '' . 
  just be aware : they involve sadness , lack of potato , and occasional politburo . 
  [ ex\u0101mp\u013ce ] ( http://joelx.com/35-funniest-latvian-jokes/7926/ ) . 
  seriously speaking - [ politburo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politburo ) is a russian portmanteau term for political bureau , which was exactly , highest collective leadership of a communist party . 
   whilst ukraine does n't have a lion on its national coat of arms ruthenia ( meaning both zakarpatye and lviv palatinate in commonwealth/polish times ) had . 
  on the other hand , tryzub looks kind of like falling bird . 
  historical grand coa of portugal had [ dragons ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/bras%c3%a3o_de_armas_de_portugal ) . 
  politburo rule is harsh , that 's why even latvian letters are crying . 
   and none of the nordic countries ever had lions on their territory neither they did have elephants , and still danes have a given decoration ... 
  british cuisine is quite diverse , of course mostly because of colonial and recent multicultural history . 
  so you have some awful dishes ( fish & chips , yuck ) and some tasty ones . 
  also , tbh i like `` english breakfast '' ( maybe except beans ) , it 's definitely filling you for a day . 
  of course it 's nowhere comparable to cuisines like italian or greek , definitely worse than german or polish ( :p ) , but calling it `` worst european cuisine '' is an overstatement . 
   `` fuck it lets fry it all i 'm sure it 'll taste nice '' exactly . 
  it 's very heavy , rather boring and bland taste-wise . 
  i enjoyed slovakian cuisine much more ( it 's interesting mix of highlanders ' , hungarian and of course also czech ) , and beer is awesome there as well . 
   no potato nowhere . 
  soo ... potato everywhere ? 
  ( english has weird negation ), 
   it 's not poor men food , it 's typical for northern europeans . 
  exactly . 
  potatoes have strong endurance against cold , that 's why they grow well here . 
  generally , it 's not a demanding plant cultivation-wise . 
  polan can into top five !, 
  oh yeah , belarus and their [ bulbasaur ] ( http://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/6/2/6/7513626.jpg ) . 
  why are your letters crying ? 
  tbh , czech cuisine is awful . 
  maybe even worse than british . 
  beer , however ... 
  best vodka is grain vodka !, 
  k\u00f6ttbullar are great . 
  there is one , although not visible now ( mostly underground ) . 
  it was jewish equivalent of w\u0105chock btw . 
  city of stupid people , ones who you joke about . 
  because for modern china trade is crucial . 
  they are factory of the world . 
  if they ca n't export , they will perish . 
  trade needs stability and peace . 
  or as you called it , playing the game . 
  it rather looks like they were called to restrain italy from committing homicide on swedish chief . 
  not everyone needs to eat pizza daily . 
   pizza or burger , but no pizza burger plz . 
  also , both should be eaten fresh . 
  not frozen . 
  i bet half of our score are hobos gathering used beer cans . 
  i bet bug :(, 
  prime minister . 
  not even talking about loyalty of vassals . 
  that * long reign * bonus . 
  so ... a lich ? 
  it smelled of * krem\u00f3wka * . 
  it did .
