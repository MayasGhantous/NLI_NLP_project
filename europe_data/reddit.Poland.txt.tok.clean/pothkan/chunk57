  maybe not in 10 years , but 15 - definitely . 
   germans ( ... ) right winged leader i 'm getting uncomfortable . 
  why am i getting uncomfortable ? 
  [ meanwhile in poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n4ziqv2z0s ) . 
  i do n't think it 's really a plan to establish a pro-government militia . 
  it 's just building a group of people , who will receive money for their hobby , and because of that would be grateful . 
  their families too . 
  tl ; dr - more pis voters . 
  i would add ge/am/az and cy , though . 
  poland stronk ( 5th ) . 
  and netherlands won this time . 
   remember , he launched a coup in the 1990s . 
  and later was a target of one . 
  i do n't intend to defend chavez 's policies . 
  but he at least had some various goals - and was a person made of both positives and negatives . 
  maduro does n't seem to care about anything except staying in power . 
  polska can into nordic ? 
   it is in fact possible for an german to sound like a queer . 
  it 's called an austrian . 
  [ confirmed ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2f/8a/0b/2f8a0bce49810c5205c9531b4d0edcb6.png ), 
  imho crucial difference between chavez and maduro is that first one was n't a ** dictator ** . 
  elections during his rule were generally fair , and when opposition tried to recall him , he agreed to [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venezuelan_recall_referendum,_2004 ) , fought and won . 
  of course , chavez was a charismatic politician , fanatically loved by many venezuelans . 
  maduro definitely is n't one . 
  poland - [ bundz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundz ) . 
  sadly , it 's hardly available outside podhale , and only during a season . 
  other than this , i 'm pleasantly surprised by [ koryci\u0144ski ] ( http://serkorycinski.com/img/gremza02.jpg ) , especially black-caraway kind . 
  they are ** partially ** compatible . 
   they might admire putin 's methods but they clearly are n't pro-russian . 
  that 's the paradox . 
   however poland at 34 % ... are you fucking kidding me , no way i would n't be so surprised . 
  notice ( self-supressed ) putinism of our government . 
  which has ~ 35 % support . 
  maybe . 
  yes . 
  united we stand , divided we fall . 
   though i think there are more languages `` confused '' in this way . 
  most of continental europe/eu : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_and_short_scales#current_usage, 
  afaik the closest to hungarian languages are khanty & mansy . 
  a * little * [ distant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khanty-mansi_autonomous_okrug ) , but still . 
   also would n't serbian latin be just croatian ? 
  no , there are many differences in vocabulary , both minor ( e.g. 
  exactly is to\u010dno in croatian , ta\u010dno in serbian ) and major ( e.g. 
  names of months , croatian has slavic , serbian latin ) . 
  here is short [ comparison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_standard_bosnian,_croatian,_montenegrin_and_serbian ) . 
  however , while there are numerous differences between croatian and serbian , bosnian is very similar to both ( and differences are mostly bunch of turkish or islamic-borrowed words ) , and montenegrin to serbian . 
   now i 'm not sure why the word would be different in polish , it 's a slavic language so it would make sense to me that it would be similar with other slavic languages . 
  then again i 'm not a linguist so i could be wrong there . 
  it 's invented word . 
  should n't greece be non-green too ? 
   a plain old selfishly rational populist . 
  which is actually a `` good option '' in v4 countries now . 
  welp . 
   ~ ~ judges ~ ~ surgeons should be appointed by citizens , preferably in direct election . 
   ~ ~ judges ~ ~ chiefs of police should be appointed by citizens , preferably in direct election . 
   ~ ~ judges ~ ~ airplane pilots should be appointed by citizens , preferably in direct election . 
   not in france , tabloids do n't exist here . 
  why ? 
  polan is squish . 
  sorry , wrong question . 
  i thought about eu image , it 's trust here . 
   i , for one , agree that nudity should n't be frowned upon . 
  neither should be un-nudity ( is it even a word ? 
  i guess not ) , like e.g. 
  burkini . 
  as long as people do it on their own will and are adults , they should wear ( or not wear ) whatever they want . 
  same , above was posted on twitter , i linked to program which was aired yesterday after 8 pm . 
   they 're hell-bent on making everyone hate us and makes us hating everyone . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/6r52qf/tvp_polish_state_tv_yesterday/ ) . 
  quotas are about refugees , not migrants . 
  and ukrainians are not refugees ( except some small < 100 number ) . 
  which means - as big as possible . 
  we have thresholds written into constitution , `` soft '' 55 % and `` hard '' 60 % . 
  if something bad happens here , football hooligans would be pis ' equivalent of * titushky * . 
  remember my words . 
  he met football hooligans ? 
  trianon ? 
  not to the level of no chance of compromise . 
  what ? 
  i just checked actual pdf , and it says 50 % positive , 38 % neutral and 11 % negative . 
  so it 's `` split in half '' only if you count neutral as negative ... 
  i 'm not sure , pi\u0142sudski would be a close contender . 
  either one of these two , anyway . 
  it 's not , it aired on tvp info yesterday after 8 pm . 
  that 's quality of tvp after pis ' takeover . 
  to be honest , do n't you think she is ** too benign ** verbally ? 
  i hardly remember angela making any harsh statement about other politician , even if it 's deserved . 
  but i 'm not a german , so feel free to prove me wrong . 
  tbh , this map should n't be labelled `` more trust '' , but '' ** less distrust ** '' . 
   we are basicaly this irl north ? 
  whyyyyy, 
   is whole tvp like that or just tvp info ? 
  same `` quality '' , less quantity . 
  true , i think it was in good taste . 
  [ meanwhile in tvp ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/6r52qf/tvp_polish_state_tv_yesterday/ ) ( polish state tv ) ... :-(, 
   and also , the one you linked is the slovak one . 
  that 's the joke !, 
  it 's not that bad . 
  [ short ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandr_grigorievi%c4%8d_luka%c5%a1enko ) , though . 
  his can be funny and snarky , but still , there 's this whole luxembourgian taxes mud .
