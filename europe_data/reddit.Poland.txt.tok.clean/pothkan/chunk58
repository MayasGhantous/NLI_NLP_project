  but timmermans or verhofstadt - i 'd vote for them if i could . 
  it lacks eu politicians , like tusk , juncker , timmermans , verhofstadt , schultz etc. 
  i 'm afraid netherlands won this time . 
  sorry finland , but your performance is disappointing . 
  euro is more than just money , it 's one of symbols of european unity . 
  and yes , i 'd love to see copernicus , maria sk\u0142odowska-curie or chopin on euro banknotes . 
   i 'd say historical politicians ( pre 1900 ) could be used . 
  napoleon , carolingian , kanute napoleon would probably enrage spanish . 
  it 's just an example . 
   otherwise , explorers such as columbus , barentsz , da gama . 
  better , but in this case you might invoke controversial colonial past . 
  generally - why bother with anybody controversial , if we can decide on more universally recognized personalities ? 
  controversial . 
  scientists , musicians , writers , philosophers , artists . 
  no royals or politicians . 
  r/polska is . 
  slovak tatry are even higher , though :|, 
  [ denmark in anime ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pft-0ghcocq/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  i rather think they will go for ( rather neutral now ) local daily magazines , trying to `` encircle '' anti-pis titles like gw , polityka or newsweek . 
  they might also try something against solorz-\u017bak . 
   this is not about president protecting democracy , this is power struggle . 
  unless they are just playing us . 
  two steps back , one step forward . 
   while opposition protects status-quo because current judicary is sympathetical to po ( main opposition party ) . 
  nope , ** because cancelling terms of elected judges is breaking the law of constitution ** . 
   but that crisis was ( mostly ) averted ** exactly ** . 
  two vetoed , one passed . 
  two steps back , one forward . 
  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-25/poland-s-president-is-no-friend-of-the-opposition they just try to lull our vigilance . 
  notice also all these `` smoke curtains '' - fuel covering the judiciary ; previous ( year ago ) it was ministers ' earnings one . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
   most likely he would have ceded gdansk and poland/germany would have allied to smash the soviets and strangle communism in its cradle . 
  wet dream of many polish alternative history lovers . 
  we 'll never know . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_%c3%85land_islands ( check 1917-1921 ), 
  you are thereby employed as new graphic redactor . 
   ehh , it really is n't . 
  polish is easy , especially for me , as i speak russian . 
  exactly . 
  slavic languages are easy for other slavs ( i learned russian muuuch more easy and quickly than english ) , but hard for everyone outside the slav family . 
  safe bet is that duda 's ratings ( already quite high , despite him being a kaczy\u0144ski 's puppet until vetoes , and kaczy\u0144ski having low ratings himself ) will grow in near future . 
  because it 's exactly like that . 
  only with different religion . 
  kaczy\u0144ski even said ( in one interview ) that `` poland should be like turkey '' , three years ago . 
   the latest move was to gain control of the constitutional court , undermining the independence of the judiciary they already did that . 
  recent move was to control ( regular ) ** judiciary itself ** , especially supreme court . 
  tbh , it 's a general slav specialty . 
   po is defactor centre-left party now http://i.imgur.com/baxwqbh.jpg, 
  gowin is just korwin without looney statements ( and any charisma , to be honest ) , and much more catholic stance . 
  stronk late 1990s/early 2000s vibes . 
   russia ( ns ) had been disliked , is disliked , will be disliked . 
  soviets , not russia . 
  i 'm sure that the moment you 'll start to honestly break ( and apologize ) with soviet past , just like germans did ( eventually ) with their nazi one , russia would instantly start to be more liked . 
  especially for things it deserves to be praised ( e.g. 
  rich culture ) . 
  soviet russian government recognized independce of poland rougly sometime then too . 
  and two years later we had to repel them at the gates of warsaw . 
   besides the fact that people do n't work like this , have you considered that these soldiers had families ? 
  of course . 
  my grandpa 's cousin ( upper silesian ) was forcefully conscripted to wehrmacht , and died somewhere in east front in 1943 . 
  that 's why i leave candles every year at soviet cemetery in my hometown ( poland ) , although i 'm very critical about soviet union itself . 
  still , they died fighting even worse enemy . 
  point - their ( soldiers who died in winter war ) deaths should be blamed on ** leadership of attacking ** side ( meaning soviet union ) , not defenders like hayha . 
  generally best snipers of ww ii were usually hunters . 
  one of best soviet ones was some buryat poacher . 
  it would enrage kukiz ( semi-pro-anti-pis party , who strongly supports duda now ) , maybe even pushing them into anti-pis camp . 
  he was quite popular before ~ 2002-03 . 
  thx . 
   has that ever worked in practice ? 
  with kwa\u015bniewski a little , because he had harsh relation with miller . 
  of course it 's not apolitical - but he was at least independent ( from his camp ) . 
   i wonder where kachynsky would be able to escape to if things go really bad for him . 
   places like gornja mao\u010da are still rare are those actually connected to terrorism ? 
  or just people living in a weird way ( * na putu * movie ? 
  my grandpa worked for two years in libya during 1980s , as a surgeon . 
  sure , pay was great ( especially for someone from poland then ) , but atmosphere was ... stuffy ( and again , point of view of someone from `` people 's democracy '' ) . 
  people ( libyans , not poles ) disappearing without trace , gossip about mass graves - and on the other hand , extremely bossy ghadafian officials . 
  and african immigrants treated as slaves . 
  all that in scenery of excellent roads , hospitals , shops etc. 
   just look what happened to anakin !, 
  he got cool helmet ? 
   are 4 people or less less , because some could be dead . 
  `` fiut '' means dick in polish . 
  yeah , but fyodor is russian , while - dolf is germanic . 
   edit : downvotes ? 
  really ? 
  probably muslims . 
  and jews . 
  and jealous vegetarians . 
  cranberry = \u017curawina , lingonberry = brusznica . 
  very similar . 
  santa claus is n't king of poland . 
  or son of the queen . 
  whatever applies now , i 'm actually confused about our divine rulership . 
  unless he makes some kind of deal in brussels . 
   thats hardly corruption , its nepotism . 
  which is even worse . 
  in comparison . 
  we are n't really known for huge protests . 
   last time was during communism actually even then there was no one-party government .
