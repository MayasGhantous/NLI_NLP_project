  there were some puppet parties , zsl and sd . 
  although now it 's the same ... ( sp , gowin ) . 
  completely uncommon , it 's first time ** ever ** ( after 1989 ) . 
  that 's actually quite healthy way of thinking . 
  maybe not smart , but healthy . 
  hard to say , pis vs anti-pis support is roughly even now . 
  first , there are over two years until election ( oct 2019 ) . 
  second , there are two `` trials '' in meanwhile ( 2018 locals , 2019 ep ) . 
  third , a lot would depend on who cross , and who do n't cross the thresholds ( 5 % ) . 
  lower the number of parties in the parliament , higher the bonus from winning one . 
  fourth , except of pis & anti-pis there are some anti-both forces ( like kukiz ) , whose policy ( coalition preferences ) will be unclear . 
   how does the silent majority feel about this ? 
  linking to my recent [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/6ow7xp/polish_politics_for_a_non_polish_person/dkkqa3s/ ) . 
  tbh , namibia has one of best results among subsaharean africa . 
  and papa recep !, 
  you just failed at math . 
  and still 99 % + of them do n't , at all . 
  not accidental . 
  they could grab it for 8 years , and they did n't . 
  po might be lazy and sleazy , but they are n't authoritarians . 
  8 hour ^, 
  so we should treat anecdotical evidence over the statistics ? 
   marshal law ** martial ** law . 
   pis had easy job with that . 
  polish judiciary is incredibly corrupted . 
  ** it 's not ** . 
  pis media blown situation out of the proportion . 
  if you look at different statistics , polish judiciary actually comes in the middle among other eu countries , as average . 
  there are worse ones both in the west and east . 
  orban is lesser threat , and not a madman . 
  make a deal with him . 
  so true it 's sad :(, 
  you know pis is actually most `` communist '' party in present sejm ? 
  do n't give erdogan ideas . 
   his brother has the fair right to be angry about it angry ? 
  he openly accused opposition of ** murdering ** him . 
  also , `` po raped little girls for 8 years '' . 
  meh , it happened in some polish province when gierek was visiting . 
  draw . 
  nope , it 's both . 
  there are numerous cases of white europeans . 
  heck , there 's even a german girl mentioned above in the linked text .

  families are n't at fault ( except sin of neglection ) , brainwashing happens via the internet , social media etc. 
  thanks , might be worth watching . 
  linda is a muslim name ? 
   oh now it makes more sense . 
  not really . 
  first , there are many cases of white european girls/women ( recently there was one from some townlet in denmark , planning a bomb attack there , brainwashed entirely via internet ) , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6o0aay/ak47s_heart_emoji_and_feminism_how_jihadi_brides/dkedzm4/ ) are some examples . 
  second , those from imigrant families were often raised in secular way , check e.g. 
  story about two bosnian-austrian girls , sometime ~ 2-3 years ago . 
  islamism is just like radical leftist terrorism ~ 40-50 years ago - it feeds on specific kind of people . 
  still , it does n't really allow to call singapore a liberal state . 
  i 've heard somewhere a term `` technocratorship '' , and think if fits . 
  anyway , even if this system works there ( and indeed , it seems to work ) , repeating / copying it anywhere else could be not possible . 
  could you share some ? 
  i ` am always happy for bits of propaganda gems from fellow commie country . 
  kind of like `` vistula country '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_land in the past . 
  they must protect these patriots against the `` animalist crowd of total opposition '' / s, 
  you forgot `` hidden german option '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/de3b5ioxuaexyre.jpg ) is pro-government demonstration ( sunday , same place ) . 
   before he discovered democracy he was a member of a de facto socialist youth organisatio and kaczy\u0144ski 's father was in the party . 
  so what ? 
  poll was made on july 11/12 , whole mess about judiciary rose on 13/14 . 
   this would guarantee no more than 3 parties getting in those . 
  they 'd become really unrepresentative . 
  true , so maybe adding a parallel `` all-poland '' list would be a good idea . 
  that 's how it worked 1922/35 . 
   but how exactly do you split warsaw ? 
  you do n't . 
  urban districts stay as they are ( or even new one could be formed , e.g. 
  tricity ) . 
  it was one of major reasons why i voted . n instead of po in 2015 . 
  which was still a hasty decision looking from now , but ... one makes mistakes :(, 
  yup . 
  another good possible change : smaller districts . 
  now ~ half of provinces are single-district ones , many other two-district . 
  which makes e.g. 
  people from \u0141om\u017ca and suwa\u0142ki , or s\u0142upsk and gdynia , voting for the same bunch of people . 
  true , that 's why i 'm against any ideas of more complicated voting system , like e.g. 
  it sounds excellent in theory , but in practice ... 
  that he will sign it . 
  he 's called `` first pen '' for a reason . 
  no proof . 
  psl was always strong in local politics . 
  and they might get lucky because of complicated booklets ( where they were on first pages , because of drawn number ) . 
  yeah , but threshold is too high . 
  i 'd change it from 5/8 to 3/5 . 
   minister appoints judges . 
  its used by many countries . 
  which ? 
  where judges are just directly appointed by a minister ? 
   he was actually convicted but was pardoned by the current president . 
  you think about mariusz kami\u0144ski ( who is a minister w/o portfolio ) . 
  justice minister is zbigniew ziobro - he was nearly placed before the tribunal of state ( for his actions in 2005-07 term ) during previous term , but some po mps did n't appear , so vote was lost . 
   and what about this ? 
  u/thinsteel made a joke , and you seem to not get it , so i posted an explanation ( as you might not hear about whole thing , it was over a year ago ) . 
  better not , they might treat it as a manual . 
   they did unfortunately .
