  they 're just * pro-life * zealots . 
   but yes , it would ban all abortions . 
  except when birth is directly dangering ** life ** ( not health ) of mother . 
  so , examples when woman wo n't be given an abortion : * post-rape pregnancy ; * health danger ( e.g. 
  there was a case few years ago when woman lost sight in similar circumstances ) ; * cancer ( if a mother has to get chemio - or radiotherapy ) - so `` nature could take it 's course '' = fetus dying in uterus ; * fetus with serious defects , e.g. 
  anencephaly ; and in the meantime government is limiting access to `` day after '' contraceptives . 
   the lucky ones gon na travel to the neighbouring countries . 
  unless they design law in such way , that abortion abroad could still be penalised ( onto a woman doing that ) . 
   ** he was quoting the foreign minister from previous goverment , who said that when speaking about relations with usa . 
  not one foreign media center jumped on previous minister trying to make him racist , because he was one of their guys , but they did that with pis minister who was just quoting him . 
  why is that ? 
  there is a big difference : previous minister was saying it during private , ilegally wiretapped conversation . 
  present one is doing it in open . 
  of course i doubt either of them is racist , it 's just inappropriate use of words . 
  altough on the other hand , there were ( are ? ), 
  some racists in pis ( like recently deceased deputy g\u00f3rski , known for calling election of obama `` end of white man 's era '' ) , while po had/has actually afro-polish deputies ( godson , munyama ) in its ranks . 
   now , i do n't think that abortion bill has any chance to pass ( . . ) and ultimate voting wo n't be bound by `` party discipline '' ( this is a mechanism that can be used to force representatives to vote one way or another , according to party doctrine , with punishments like fines for those who break it ) in law and justice party i 'm afraid it can be easily passed . 
  consider , that pis deputies would be under strong pressure from their voters ' ( pis ** core ** electorate is strongly catholic ) , church and pro-lifers , and actually i suppose they would support this ban sincerely . 
  as will probably vote some catholic deputies from opposition : psl , kukiz and po ( take few from every of those clubs , and you 'll get at least ~ 20 more `` yes '' votes ) . 
  remember , that there was a similar move during their 2005-07 rule , stopped only thanks to president lech kaczy\u0144ski , persuaded by his wife ( who was then offended by rydzyk , calling her `` a witch '' ) . 
  however , i agree that this issue is definitely not welcomed from pis pov . 
  but they have no real choice . 
  imho : in short perspective , it will be painful and destructive for many women . 
  however , in longer it can end in more progressive law ( than present one ) being passed after change of government ( because `` abortion compromise '' would be broken with passing of present proposal ) , hopefully in next elections . 
  nope , wykop is more like 4chan . 
   and anyway they do n't have anything better to do those cods wo n't catch itselves . 
  it would be closest , and probably still in border-free zone . 
   i do n't know man , the drinking until you lie on the ground thing is often viewed as overly macho and boorish here too . 
  not in eastern europe . 
  here it means you failed at drinking . 
  russian tourists in tricity and surrounding areas are fine and behaving . 
  however , they are mostly families or pairs from k\u00f6nigsberg on one/two-day shopping trips . 
  but english are despicable , confirmed also here . 
   for example , for cz and sz we use \u010d and \u0161 . 
  because you copied it from czech alphabet , which was designed in 15th century , during hussite period . 
  we ( poles ) designed our orthography a little later ( early 16th ) , independently , so different solution was chosen . 
   very nice , but is n't tsch really one consonant written with four letters ? 
  not in this case probably , as i suppose it 's similar to german angst + schrei . 
   so , mostly western countries . 
  that seems odd to me . 
  they forgot some ece/see countries ' parties . 
  like greek golden dawn or slovak lsns . 
  34 years in total ( 1919-1926 + since 1989 ) . 
   we had elected king , sejm , legal definition of ` citizenship ' many other shit , you can read on wikipedia . 
  problem is that while ~ 10 % of population ( gentry ) had lots of rights , 80 % ( peasants ) had next to none . 
  while peasants in western countries ( like england or france ) , although of course subpar to gentry , had at least some citizens ' rights . 
  yes , of course , may 3 , 1791 constitution was a move towards right direction ( and ko\u015bciuszko 's insurrection even moreso ) , but it happened much , much too late . 
  and btw , it 's a myth our constitution was a first one ( modern ) in the world . 
   it 's possible it happens here too , but unlikely . 
  nah , spammers here are doing it for free . 
  that 's true as well . 
  but it partially explains , why public opposition to pis is much stronger , than to fidesz . 
  pis won barely , while fidesz is still landsliding . 
   also , to assume that people which for some reason refused to vote are against the gov is just a fallacy , they could be as well divided as the voters are . 
  i did n't said that pis 19 % means 81 % for anti-pis . 
  i consider not voting as `` no opinion '' or `` abstaining '' . 
  what i mean , is that pis has smaller ** base ** than fidesz . 
  by the way , this 19 % is highest pis result ever , while fidesz had better one before ( 35 % in 2010 ) . 
  anti-pis base in last election was also 19 % ( po+n + . psl , 22 % with left ) , while similar base of anti-fidesz in hungary ( \u00d6sszefog\u00e1s + lmp ) is much lower compared to fidesz base . 
  unfortunately it 's still strong according to other pollers . 
  which says something about us . 
  nothing good . 
  and again , it 's similar to support for putin in russia or lukashenka in belarus . 
  which is definitely strong - lower than official numbers - but still probably over 50 % . 
  on the other hand , rise of support for winning party after elections is quite normal , and now it 's actually lower ( slower ) than po 's after 2007 elections . 
  there two differences . 
  first , orban has stronger support among citizens ( 28 % compared to pis 19 % ) , and opposition in hungary is much more weak & divided . 
  second , orban 's diplomacy towards eu is rather `` civil '' - btw , fidesz is still part of epp - while kaczy\u0144ski 's is full of exacerbation . 
   well you definitely are with hungary . 
  orban is using poland 's crisis for his own good . 
  he is no longer `` black sheep '' of central europe . 
  kremlin 's , of course . 
  pis = po\u017cyteczni idioci sowiet\u00f3w ( soviets ' useful idiots ) what 's terrifying , that they are unaware of this . 
   then ted cruz wins the election and all of posted above would happen while ted cruz had complete power over republican majority in congress and senate , or was extremely loyal to another politician with such power . 
  which would be entirely contrary to american tradition of lack of single leadership in major parties . 
   whether he was successful or not depends on your political leanings . 
  it will rather depend on referendum result . 
  interesting . 
  it might be connected to fact , that `` green '' welsh areas in map posted by me seems to be less populated . 
  and some in south ( cardiff ? 
  ) , better populated , are actually red . 
  but what about scotland ? 
  it seems to be more consistently `` green '' . 
   the conservatives did quite well there in the 2015 general election . 
  my assumption is that conservatives are divided on brexit affair , both statesmen and voters ( while labour is against , and ukip pro ) . 
  am i wrong ? 
  question : considering that anti-eu regions in uk are [ mostly england proper , while wales is pro-eu and scotland is strongly pro-eu ] ( http://cdn1.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/2016/02/160229_eurosceptic_map_yougov.jpg ) , would n't brexit actually mean ** collapse ** of uk ? 
  is n't it ... just suicidal then ? 
   it was all about pulling po out of power no , it was n't ** all ** . 
  refugee crisis was at least a secondary factor during elections , and po lost some support ( probably few % ) because of agreement to accept refugees . 
  of course po would lose anyway , but with smaller margin , and that alone could take seats ' majority from pis . 
  being a pro-eu society , while choosing an eurosceptic government ? 
  talk about paranoia . 
  being a poland 's fancy headgear ? 
  is ba in the field in syria ? 
  i 'm not talking about aviation . 
  so if they want to fight in syria , you should be ok with that . 
  i 'm confused . 
  you clearly know nothing about kurds . 
   they are already radicalized enough to go fight in syria .
