  when ? 
  what comparable did po to what 's pis doing with courts now ? 
  actually polish dictatorship was mostly opposed by nationalists ( both polish and ukrainian ) and ( later ) fascists . 
  it was centre-conservative - `` great tent '' itself . 
  i think the best comparison would be turkey under atat\u00fcrk . 
  sadly , after the death of pi\u0142sudski it started to slightly move towards right side . 
  i do n't mean democracy itself , but state of it . 
  sure , ee had bigger problems , and here democracy is actually threatened - but both usa and uk do n't really look stable & predictable now . 
  it 's a global mess . 
  i really would want to share your hope . 
  time will show . 
  nope , not this time . 
  it 's entirely our fault . 
   but reform changes judge election system to similar one to germany . 
  that 's what pis wants you to believe . 
  exactly . 
  we could at least blame soviets then . 
  now , it 's completely our own fault . 
   that 's why saying `` the german system is similar '' while only looking at the selection process is dishonest . 
  and even selection process is n't similar at al. . first , land-governments have a say about it in germany . 
  second , there 's a political custom of cross-partisanship there . 
   there is some chance it will be vetoed by president . 
  i admire your naivety . 
  and am a little jealous ...  one question . 
  how does this differ from constitutional tribunal ? 
  they are also choosen by sejm . 
  with voting judges based on bigger 2/3 majority ? 
  and some mixed system , electing them by different bodies ? 
  seriously , i ca n't understand how anybody can think giving this decision to mere 50 % + 1 majority can be a good idea . 
   that 's what happens when you give an uneducated electorate `` free money '' in social programs ( 500pln / ~ 120eur per month for a second child until adulthood ) while ballooning the national debt . 
  i do n't think it 's about money itself . 
  it 's more about simple program put into work quickly . 
  it does n't matter whether it 's good or sustainable program . 
  people see that pis ** promised ** something , and ** delivered ** . 
  so now they believe in all their promises . 
  it works just like ponzi schemes - rate of return is good at the beginning . 
  i would exchange kaczy\u0144ski for orban any day . 
  at least he seems sane . 
  unless eu would struck a deal with orban . 
  imho it 's doable . 
  he 's not a fanatic , only a cynic crook . 
   they advertised things like changing the constitution ** way before ** the elections exactly . 
  all this happening now was in manual , they already tried in 2005-07 . 
  voter 's memory is awfully short in poland . 
  ** everybody else ** ( except fringe parties like onr or zmiana ) . 
  seriously , i would even choose korwin or kukiz over pis ( if there was no other choice ) . 
  `` symetrists '' are worse - all those people who said and are saying `` po is the same '' . 
  sure , po sucks , and their lack of activity is at fault here , but they never crossed the lines . 
  we need icons of bigger shit . 
  you mean kurz ? 
   unfortunately until now my impression is that every country protects its own interests ( ie . 
  we do n't want migrants , italy signed the treatises so it 's their responsibility ) and that the opposite of what the eu should be exactly . 
  i 'm actually more ashamed about our ( polish ) stance because of that ( lack of solidarity with countries like italy or greece ) , than because of caring about refugees . 
  we simply end looking like ingrate jerks . 
   that 's the beauty of having a bunch unstable governments that barely last 3 years . 
  thing is , it was the same ~ 1920 . 
  what happened next ? 
  fascists took power with a swooping support . 
  and managed to retain most of it for ~ 15 years ( roughly until 1938/39 ) . 
  look what 's happening in uk and usa . 
  democracy is fragile nearly everywhere , countries like germany are an exception . 
  it will be too late then . 
   you ca n't reform the system without reelection of the judges based on the new rules . 
  you can either ( or both ) , elect new judges according to new rules ... * ... after the terms of present ones end ; * ... with bigger ( e.g. 
  2/3 ) majority . 
   right , tusk would never do such thing . 
  because he did n't . 
  and he had 7 years of opportunity . 
  it happened in 1995 , ** before ** the 1997 constitution . 
  and 20 years ago . 
  it 's ancient history now . 
  nice whataboutism . 
  cutting the terms of present judges , and electing new ones in one swoop , by 50 % + 1 parliamentary majority . 
  in germany judges to the constitutional court are elected by two houses ( half each ) , with a 2/3 majority . 
  judges to the supreme court are elected by a body made of all current local ( l\u00e4nde ) justice ministers ( which usually come from different parties ) and selection of cross-partisan mps . 
  both happens gradually ( not all at once ) . 
  while in pis poland , those are or will be elected by mere 50 % + 1 parliamentary majority , all at once in case of krs ( which would elect supreme court next ) . 
  exactly , why ? 
  what atrocious things they plan to do , if they want to dismantle any obstacles asap ? 
   i do n't relly know if this is a reason to worry or just a political game . 
  it 's the reason to worry . 
  when pis puts their judges into krs and sn , they could do ** anything ** . 
  no brakes , no fuses . 
  simplest example - sn decides , whether elections are valid . 
  not really , he simplified . 
  it 's usually divided between different bodies ( parliament , government , corporations of judges etc. 
  ) , and 51 % majority is not enough . 
  check other comments . 
   or is there some difference in poland - e.g. 
  opposition is afraid that pis majority can choose their own judges ? 
      or are they afraid that whichever party wins next election ( by majority ) , will be able to appoint ` their own ' judges while now this ca n't happen ? 
  both . 
   can anybody explain why this is a problem ? 
  cutting the terms of present judges is main problem imho . 
  if it happens once , what guarantee would have new ones about theirs ? 
  it would lead straight to political obedience . 
  yeah , and it 's called jan szyszko . 
  no need , he 's well trained . 
  he actually got memetic as ex-president .
