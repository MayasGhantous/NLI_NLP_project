  kind of . 
  meh , you are still only a palliative . 
  would change for people like zeman be an improvement ? 
  i just vote for direct anschluss . 
  actually i 'm 6 % german : o, 
  then we will be truly fucked . 
  and btw , he 's even older . 
   i guess new person will be the leader . 
  who ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  registered parties have 5 % threshold , `` election committees '' ( coalitions ) 8 % . 
  during 2015 elections , it affected zl and kukiz ' 15 . 
  thing is , kaczy\u0144ski is not a youngster ( he 's 69 ) , and will eventually die , like everyone of us . 
  what will happen in pis then ? 
  it will be like chavez =  maduro . 
  so what , i 'm worse because i have flair of my region instead of country ? 
   still did your country majority vote those right wing assholes or not ? 
  not exactly , they got lucky . 
  read discussion starting from [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mzzp7/changes_to_judiciary_spark_fresh_concern_in_poland/dk5tvnj/ ) comment . 
   that alone would have prevented a majority for pis if i understand the process correctly . 
  yes . 
  there are numerous alternative scenarious , which would prevent it ( of course , they would probably still be able to form a majority coalition ) : * zl crossing the threshold ; * korwin crossing the threshold ; * worse result of . n , which would probably mean better result of po ; pis actually got very lucky . 
  po had similar result in 2007 , and they did n't get single majority . 
   that can be changed to prevent such a scenario . 
  maybe not prevent , but imho thresholds should be lower ( 3/5 instead of 5/8 ) , and electoral districts smaller ( e.g. 
  some provinces are made of ** one ** district , many just of ** two ** ) . 
   hovewer they shut up when you point them out that they have only about 12 % counted with the same method  difference is , that they do n't scream about `` will of the majority '' . 
   why 'd he veto this ? 
  probably to be able to say he vetoed something . 
  it 's a minor case , and i bet it would be passed anyway after some cosmetic changes . 
  true , but even if 10 % of that is true ... we 're fucked . 
  there are numerous ties ( indirect , via various circles , including italian-american mafia ; and going back even ~ 30 years ) to [ semyon mogilevich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semion_mogilevich ) . 
   kwidzy\u0144 , poland . 
  imho you should also add flags of european capitals and bigger ( e.g. 
  over 1m ) cities . 
   as well as first level administrative regions ( regions ) of european countries does it mean you 'll e.g. 
  add flags of all latvian or macedonian communes ? 
  sorry , but it seems stupid :(, 
  [ i would n't entirely agree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronislav_grombchevsky ) . 
   can you really blame him for a partitions that took place hundred years later ? 
  habsburgs were a threat to poland already in the past , numerous times . 
  and france tried to discourage him - this time it would be good idea to listen . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.infostormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vladimir_putin.jpg ) . 
  seriously , nobody posted him before ? 
  blatant british lies . 
  he was a great guy , we even praise him in our anthem . 
  hey , we have those in poland too !, 
  tetris joke is a good one . 
  we got , they took part in partitions ... sobieski was great military commander ... but a shitty politician .

  apparently he is still viewed positively in belarus , where he was born ( then russian empire of course ) . 
  there are ( [ belarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dzyarzhynsk ) , [ russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dzerzhinsk,_russia ) ) and were ( [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toretsk ) , renamed only recently ) cities named after him . 
  still , it 's most powerful position in the country . 
  yeah , it 's often compared : `` good '' lenin vs `` bad '' stalin . 
  while they were all scumbags then , same about trotsky . 
  it 's also a reminder , that any respectable ideology ( socialism/marxism in this case ) can go bad , sometimes morbidly . 
  dzier ** \u017c ** y\u0144ski , sorry for typo in the title .

  it depends on product . 
  still , at least it means much lower tariff rates . 
   the speech of trump on krasi\u0144ski place was actually nice and included unintended triggering of butthurt in pis crowd , when he appraised wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  is it rosiewicz ? 
  because i 'm afraid to click your link . 
  and very suspiciously , says nothing about family ties of pis politicians or supporters . 
  present minister of defense is not only tied to russian intelligence , but also mafia and polish communist secret police . 
  are you sure ? 
  because i digged into my genealogy , and found to be `` only '' 94 % polish ( joking but serious ) . 
  yup , and means exactly `` reconstruction '' ( przebudowa ) . 
  greenpeace . 
  yeah , because it 's ** cheap ** here ( for them ) . 
  [ vytautas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsrbyjmvbou )  jogaila etc. 
  pi\u0142sudski was proud of his heritage , and was a supporter of `` jagellonic '' idea , but still - he clearly identified as pole . 
  i would rather say , that better examples of last `` polish-lithuanians '' were micha\u0142 pius r\u00f6mer or stanis\u0142aw narutowicz . 
   accept it , lithuanians best kings of poland !, 
  true , zygmunt i was the bestest . 
   even pilsudski had lithuanian bloodline are you really a lithuanian ? 
  afaik pi\u0142sudski is not really liked there . 
  poland wo n't feel included :(, 
  actually i agree here . 
  this stupid plot destroyed any hope for polish-lithuanian partnership between the wars . 
  at least we did n't repeat this mistake in 1990s , when warsaw ** declined ** to support [ separatist attempts ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/polski_kraj_narodowo-terytorialny ) of some lithuanian poles ( probably planned in moscow anyway ) , supporting lithuania 's independence instead . 
  liberum veto , however , was our common fault . 
  maybe even more lithuanian than polish , because it was mostly used by * magnateria * , which was more strong in the wkl ( although rather in ruthenia than lithuania proper ) . 
  imagine warsaw-budapest-ankara axis ... 
   did we left eu like le pen france would ? 
  according to fresh polls , 51 % of poles would prefer leaving the eu , than accepting muslim refugees . 
  so our `` famous eu-enthusiasm '' might be , sadly , actually a very shallow feeling . 
  wait , a lithuanian who do n't think commonwealth was a polish imperialism ? 
  i 'm positively surprised . 
   if you dont , its quite entertaining . 
  almost as if orban runs a competition against trump over which goverment looks more embarassing . 
  poland : `` hold me a beer '' . 
  :-( and you now , there 's also uk . 
  and what do you think ?
