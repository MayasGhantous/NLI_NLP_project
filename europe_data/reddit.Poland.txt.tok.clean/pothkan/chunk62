  but ... how do you understand each other then ? 
  it even has a name , invented by writer and journalist ziemowit szczerek - ** szyldoza ** . 
  but seriously , it 's ugly and ridiculous . 
  on the other hand ... it 's very helpful in geoguess :d, 
  brain consume lots of energy . 
  so limited brain leaves more to other parts of body . 
   i know , you 're basically talking about schwa , right ? 
  no , it 's even less similar . 
  it 's ** close unrounded vowel ** . 
  on wikipedia it 's listed as [ close - ** mid central ** unrounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_central_unrounded_vowel ) , although i think [ close ** central ** unrounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close_central_unrounded_vowel ) would be a good description as well ( i suppose there are some slight differences , depending on place in word or neighboring consonants ) . 
  `` i '' and `` y '' in polish are completely distinct vowels , while tbh i do n't hear a difference between them in czech . 
  but i speak about polish `` y '' , not czech one ( which sounds different , closer to our `` i '' ) . 
  our `` y '' is more like russian \u044b or ukrainian \u0438 . 
  plus it seems my advice should be rather after the `` r '' ( in czech words ) , not before . 
  sorry , i 'm more familiar with hr/sr than czech :(, 
  actually , it acts as vowel here . 
  hint - whenever you see such situation in croatian , serbian or czech , pronounce a short `` y '' ( polish ) before ( croatian , serbian ) or after ( czech ) the `` r '' . 
  this image needs greek weather forecast with girl dancing to the song . 
  ep is missing . 
  nearby ( also on ul . 
  built in 1860s , destroyed during ww ii . 
  but it should n't be in a chamber - where ** law ** ( supposed to be secular ) is being discussed and voted . 
  on the other hand , i have nothing against a chapel in sejm , where mps ( those who want ) could pray . 
  it 's similar on a lower scale with `` crosses in classrooms '' problem . 
  one , separate room with a cross , intended for religion lessons - ok . 
  but cross in every damned room - no . 
   there would be riots because of the cross . 
  there was a ** huge ** drama about it , and it returned few times . 
  it was put there illegally ( some mp did in his own ) , but anytime authorities tried to remove it , catholic right made a massive butthurt about it . 
  so eventually , nobody tried to touch it . 
  just like you do n't touch the hornet 's nest . 
   my countrymen do n't know anything at all tbh , we do n't even know how our country works , so there 's that ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ki8k2/voters_knowledge_by_various_groups_poland/, 
  wait , i thought belgium is a fake country , not finland . 
  i 'm confused :|, 
   we do n't really know if this true or false . 
  we know , it 's bullshit invented by kad\u0142ubek . 
  debunked already in 19th century . 
  first proved polish ruler was mieszko i , and his father & grandfather ( s/ziemowit , siemomys\u0142 ) , mentioned by generally reliable gall anonim , are considered `` probably historical '' . 
  not arabs . 
  it 's archaic name used in turkish and persian , and still in armenian . 
  depending on colonial heritage ( bulanda coming from poland , bulunya - pologne ) . 
  because she was n't there . 
  incident happened during `` free time '' . 
  apparently she learned about it only the second day , and then phoned police ( during visit to majdanek camp ) . 
  albania does n't have serbia 's political issues ( status of kosovo , pro-russian ties ) , and already is member of nato ( which should be an asset ) . 
  plus it 's smaller . 
  on the other hand , serbia already started some chapters , and is probably more ready economically . 
  anyway , imho it would be best if they join together . 
  although of course she might not be directly present near the incident . 
   seemed fishy from the beginning , how could these children even understand anyone talking to them in polish . 
  apparently class included a polish-german student . 
   but polish-made food is seriously some of the best i 've ever tasted in my life yup , we made a great progress in last 10-15 years . 
  there was an `` invasion '' of shitty food in 1990s ( including spread of american fast food chains ) , but recently things are going well . 
  still , it does n't mean there is no shitty ( and cheap ) polish food products . 
  just like there is good american one ( although stereotype would tell something contrary ) . 
  [ their king visited , good food was served ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_krak%c3%b3w ) . 
  also , halloumi is on sale in lidl right now . 
  russia has bad , at least based on what i 've seen in k\u00f6nigsberg * oblast * . 
  apparently from what i heard - ukraine too , but belarus is actually surprisingly fine . 
  hvala !, 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37634812 http://www.pap.pl/en/news/news,681905,mistral-sales-to-russia-by-egypt-pure-nonsense---kremlin.html ( polish defence minister accused france that sale of mistral landing ships to egypt is actually a coverup , and they will end in russia anyway ), 
  true , but i doubt reminding would do anything else than harm . 
  insults work only to fuel internal support , there 's no place for them in diplomacy . 
   as a supporter of macron i have to tell you that he is alienating most eu partners . 
  unfortunately , we ( poland ) do a lot to be alienated . 
  orban is at least kind of open to talks , and does n't try to insult west in every f *** ng sentence . 
  while our government conducts [ cartman diplomacy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtc3zcnizow ) . 
  ustasha tried that , with whole `` bosniaks are muslim croats '' idea . 
  i bet it 's a popular one . 
  but `` endangered by enemies '' does n't apply here . 
  polish split is more about eastern/western mentality ( german influence in wielkopolska , pomorze and upper silesia ) , and mobility ( `` recovered territories '' were mostly settled by more `` adventurous '' , `` bold '' people - [ contrary to common myth , not only from kresy ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nf4ck ) ) . 
  kind of old/new poland division . 
  if our situation was similar , western provinces should be actually more nationalist , which is n't true . 
   this applies to eastern croatia as well . 
  yeah , but why dalmatia ? 
  split and islands ? 
  some poles , but mostly catholic zentrum partei . 
  especially in ermland ( warmia ) , which was a catholic ( but mostly german ) enclave surrounded by lutheran areas . 
  yup , aka `` the wedding package '' . 
  every slav : `` challenge accepted '' . 
  every male ( or nearly ) has phimosis at birth . 
  still , 1 % is quite frequent . 
   what is a too tight foreskin at birth ? 
   some people just like make holes on paper target during weekend on shooting range you do n't need a license to do that . 
  many gun clubs allow it at location , for a fee of course . 
   medical marijuana was one of liroys main election promises , he was able to push this through and make it happen still , liroy is not in k '15 anymore . 
   guns are not for protection only . 
  they are awesome part of our culture . 
  and if you want to have a gun in poland , you can get it . 
  it 's not so hard , just get a license . 
  and even easier with membership in gun club ( for pistols etc. ), 
  or being a hunter ( for hunting rifles ) . 
  automatic weapons are of course a no-no . 
   as in gain x new young voters , lose y old voters core pis voters will vote them ** no matter what ** ( at least until jk dies , then it would probably dissolve quickly , due to lack of clear heir ) . 
  anyway , i think it could hurt kukiz most ( as pis can earn few % from them thanks to that ) . 
  why would we need guns ? 
  poland is a safe country . 
   google told you have a gun per 100 people , that is a ridiculously low number we have also a very low gun violence level . 
  i wonder if it 's somehow connected ... and actually , getting a gun license is n't so hard as it 's told . 
  things is , average pole do n't need it - if there is low crime level , there is low need for self-defense .
