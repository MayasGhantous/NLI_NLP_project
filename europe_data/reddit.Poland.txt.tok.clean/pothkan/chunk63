  unfortunately , people who want more guns are often people who should n't have them . 
   would it be worth it ? 
  legalize & put a state tax on it . 
   who would 've thought that this would happen under this extremely conservative government ? 
  i suppose kalita 's story helped . 
  hey , i never voted for them - and never would . 
  seriously , i 'd even vote sld ( our postcommies ) crooks over pis ( if there was no other choice ) . 
  but say that to one-third of polish voters ... 
  there 's nothing honestly conservative about them . 
  pis is a ** revolutionary ** party . 
  only it 's ** reactionary ** revolution . 
  it 's a real surname : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fairfax_ ( name ) of course , it does n't disprove theory above . 
   the queen is probably the one person in the world the press dare not criticize . 
  was n't she criticized by diana fanboyish press in 1990s ? 
   they probably wo n't release them for a long time after all the contents become politically irrelevant ... 
  i suppose answer to question whether she wrote any memoirs or diaries , could be released quite soon . 
  and then they could at least publish those concerning the earlier period ( e.g. 
  until 1960s ) . 
   do you know if she has written any memoirs which may be released posthumously ? 
  who knows ? 
  victoria 's diaries were released years after her death . 
  although sometimes it was the opposite . 
  juan carlos was n't really popular before he stopped the 27-f . and popularity of bhumibol ( of course partly estimated , due to his position and various lese majeste laws ) peaked after his handling black may of 1992 , when he forced government on their knees ( literally ) . 
  are you sure ? 
  i think that she would accumulate that in 74 years ... 
   but you ca n't undo the chopping down of a primeval forest . 
  or cutting a channel across the mierzeja wi\u015blana . 
  which is another stupid ( and probably ecology-harmful ) idea pis is going to do . 
  generally , yeah . 
   maybe after the next election it will get better ? 
  too early to say . 
  according to most credible polls ( ibris , they predicted 2015 elections best ) , pis roughly equals po + . n. 
  and kukiz/korwin ( considered as possible allies of pis ) roughly equal total of possible allies of po ( psl and left ) . 
  so ... it 's a draw , at the moment . 
  still , as in 2015 , lots would probably depends on who exactly gets into the parliament ( thresholds ! ) . 
  anyway , we will have two `` trial '' elections before ( locals in late 2018 , and ep in 2019 ) . 
  consumed by po . 
   our minister of foreign affairs . 
   what foreign affairs ? 
   in poland this name was also used ( bo\u017ca kr\u00f3wka ) but i 'm not sure why it went out of use . 
  maybe because * biedronka * is shorter ? 
  it might be regional thing also . 
   queen has been trolling the pm * see that girl , watch that scene * * see that girl , diggin ' the trolling queen * i could n't resist :|,

   ( tip for life : never read the comments in a youtube video ~ ~ about sweden ) . ~ ~ ftfy , it 's even better now . 
  anybody can translate what goes after the meatballs ( except c16g ) . 
  explain ? 
  never seen that yet . 
  that recep 's poker face though ... 
  methodists , lutherans , anglicans and amishes are all protestant . 
  how can they be so different and still be protestant ?

  hey , i feel you . 
  we are going to have four elections through ~ 20 months soon here in poland , 
  maybe it was chad and somebody mistaken the flag ? 
  ^ joking, 
  there was at least one ( known ) attempt in poland , on a bus in wroc\u0142aw . 
  prevented thanks to quick thinking of driver , who moved the bomb ( later confirmed as ** real ** and dangerous , it was n't fake ) outside . 
  bomber was caught , he was an ethnic pole , chemistry student . 
  probably nothing political - it was intended to be a `` warning '' before a further bigger attack , made for ransom . 
  yeah , notice that even their officers , generals do n't use neckties - it 's just shirt/sweater and jacket . 
  i think it goes back to revolution of 1979 . 
  neckties were considered as symbol of shah 's regime ( ministers , officers etc. 
  wore them , and of course shah himself ) . 
  so not wearing a tie was taken as symbol by revolutionaries ( and afaik it were leftists ' idea ) . 
  compare it to e.g. 
  chinese `` mao suits '' , mobutu 's [ abacosts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abacost ) , or even , you know , * sans-culottes * . 
  short : it has more do to with politics , than religion . 
  russia and switzerland are missing . 
  i prefered older one with flags ( just like norway or ukraine now ) . 
   which when in power quickly deteriorated into a bunch of crooks and warmongers . 
  to show more light to this statement : they won with 41 % of votes 2001 , lost with 11 % in 2005 . 
  in comparison , `` disaster '' of po in 2015 was falling from 39 to 24 % . 
   but pious shia religious leaders often refrain from wearing a tie when wearing a suit . 
  it might be an iranian thing , though . 
  remember ahmadinejad ? 
  he dressed that way , suit + no tie . 
  caucasus countries are pretty easy and cheap to visit nowadays . 
  friend of mine was there ( georgia / azerbaijan ) about a month ago , flew from cracow to kutaisi , and back from baku to budapest . 
  astana might be a bigger hassle , but calling it `` european capital '' would be a stretch anyway . 
   i visited every european capital apart from reykjavik , minsk and moscow . 
  depending on different definitions , also tbilisi , erevan , baku and ... astana . 
  it 's because of language , i suppose . 
  same with poland - instead of bigger ( more traffic ) and moderated , but polish-language r/polska , map here links to `` no man 's land '' r/poland . 
  unfortunately not / s according to few ( ? ), 
  comments in polish internet . 
  what the hell is wrong with some people ? 
   every candidate not named le pen would have won 1 on 1 against le pen . 
  result was predictable , sure . 
  but he won with ** style ** . 
  which makes him even more french . 
   not as the president of france but as the leader of the free world .
