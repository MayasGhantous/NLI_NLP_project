  those usually involve potatoes ( or rather lack of them ) , and difficulties of sad life in communist dystopia . 
  do n't know why lithuania was included . 
  i guess it would be easier to trigger them with polish flag . 
  hey , at least be happy it 's norway , not danskjavlar . 
   he would n't need fake election to win . 
  so why does he fake it ? 
  why does he bar people like navalny ( recent example ) from even taking part ? 
  putin is most popular , because there is no other choice ( save some puppet candidates ) . 
  he never took part in free elections ; he never stood to pre-election debate ( as it 's customary in any democratic country ) . 
  does it sound like strong leader , backed by support of masses ? 
  or coward hiding behind wall of propaganda ? 
   vietnam , korea , iraq , afghanistan say hi . 
  korea - un operation ( including e.g. 
  turkey , colombia and ethiopia ) ; vietnam - usa with few allies ; afghanistan - soviet union . 
   why would russia even want to meddle with albania ? 
  maybe they want to fuel `` great albania '' sentiments , to damage stability in balkans , and push serbia into russian embrace ? 
  i expected prof. farnsworth , and was suprised . 
  still , it 's left-est as possible in poland . 
  save some extremely tiny `` couch parties '' . 
  if only ... 
  this reached religious levels here in poland . 
  actually razem ( roughly polish podemos ) is very popular on the polish subreddit ( r/polska ) . 
   american here ... have you seen my country 's politics ? 
  yeah , and i see lots of similarities . 
  in this area we might be more similar to us , than any other european country . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawrlvoqqss but tbh , i agree . 
   is one of the greek islands only allows male orthodox clergy , but i dunno if that 's really a good comparison as mecca and medina are large functioning cities . 
  it 's republic of athos ( only monks live there ) , and it allows only males , they do n't need to be clergy however . 
   the baltic sea really is in a bad shape . 
  was n't it worse ~ 40 years ago ? 
   this is true everywhere . 
  i do n't agree - there are some countries ( still ) resistant to this problem . 
  best example - germany . 
  is there a reason why dacia is so popular in morocco & algeria ? 
  reposted from [ r/poland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/6gzch7/polish_political_debate_summed_up/ ) . 
  truth be told , poland might be actually an expy for many other countries in present world ( e.g. 
  - i guess - turkey or usa ) , although some seems to be resistant ( germany , norway , netherlands ) , and many in the middle . 
  although its like above since ~ 10 years here , while anywhere ( ? ), 
  else it 's more fresh situation . 
  we are strongly ( i wanted to say ` extremely ' , but ... see last point ) divided , into three roughly equal `` tribes '' : pis , anti-pis ( mostly po , but includes small polish left as well ) and `` symetrists '' ( anti-both , includes many groups , often mutually hostile ; and probably non-voting ~ 50 % of poles fall under this category as well ) . 
  is extremely damaging , because if a change of opinion can yield only negative response , that makes it ** not worth ** to do . 
  and that 's ( main reason ) why polarization happens - it 's hard to stay in the middle . 
  you end attacked from both sides . 
  this map forgot malta . 
  our overlord . 
  there was plenty of other similar city-republics in the history . 
  plus novigrad is also religious centre , which is n't usual for those . 
  because sapkowski uses to take many names accidentally , e.g. 
  from browsing the index in geographical atlas ( e.g. 
  demavend = mountain in iran ) , or surroundings ( dijkstra = name of dutch company on a truck he saw from his window ) . 
  i bet he named novigrad just after city of that name , in croatia/istria . 
  you missed , she 's 68 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss_so%c5%82dek, 
  maritime ( cmm ) , not naval . 
  naval museum ( mmw ) is in gdynia . 
  it was heavily affected ( actually destroyed ) , but after the war rebuilt in original shape ( although slightly `` historicized '' , e.g. 
  colours were based after late 18th century paintings ) . 
  however , some major destroyed parts of warsaw , especially former ghetto or area where pkin was built , were changed . 
   most polish cities rebuilt city centers as they were before war unfortunately it depends on area . 
  major cities yes ( except warsaw / besides old town / and szczecin ) , but many minor ones , especially in `` retaken territories '' were ( albeit often only partially ) exchanged with `` modern '' architecture , sometimes just ugly ( but useful ) blocks . 
  except churches , which were usually rebuilt . 
  still , it 's much better than what happened in russian part of prussia ... 
  we are divided ( when are n't we ? ) . 
  most of pis and some of kukiz crowd like him , not even talking about korwinists ( trump fangirls ) . 
  centre and left ( opposition ) - au contraire . 
  and one is a priest . 
   why merkel have no babbies ? 
  her first marriage was a failure , and when she married again ( with present husband ) , it was probably too late . 
  on the other hand , she has 80 + million germans to care about , so ... 
  now he has two , he mentioned it when talking about * ucho prezesa * . 
  plus ( at least in poland ) they often have superior location ( access to public transport , schools , services , green areas etc. 
   may really miscalculated herself . 
  it seems to be a pattern among recent tory pms . 
  these are `` cultural centres '' , not mosques . 
  problably named so to not `` trigger '' ( generally islamophobic ) population . 
  in polish : wine = sing . 
  in polish * wina * could mean both guilt and wines , but pronunciation is the same . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acute_accent that 's how this mark is called . 
  as you can see , warsaw too . 
  \u00e1 etc. 
  - i know they mean longer vowel ( not actual accents ) , but still , it means you stick to division of short/long vowels , while other slavs simplified that matter . 
  it 's a classic :d, 
  czech and serb/croatian . 
  we poles actually use some vowels - just as many as needed . 
  but of course , we have some nice clusters of our own , e.g. 
  * bezwzgl\u0119dny * ( five in a row , means ` ruthless ' ) or * wstrz\u0105s * ( four , ` quake ' ) . 
  simplified ? 
  then why do you still use accent marks ( while no other slavic language does it ) ? 
  that reminds me this clarkson 's [ gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kktxk8yiczk ) . 
  google translate fail is a bonus , if you speak polish . 
   nobody was persecuted for their religion back then unless one was atheist . 
  but that of course happened elsewhere as well . 
  more ? 
  only three are `` proper '' mosques . 
  i bet there 's more in greece , even without old ottoman ones ( which i suppose , are mostly museums now ) . 
  1-3k actually . 
  other polish mosques : * [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://d-nm.ppstatic.pl/kadr/k/r/99/8f/586cd86de7ee1_o,size,933x0,q,70,h,c28710.jpg ) ( sole one newly built in independent poland , in late 1980s ) * [ bohoniki ] ( http://atrakcjepodlasia.pl/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/meczet-bohoniki/meczet-bohoniki-02.jpg ) ( another tatar village wooden mosque , like kruszyniany , built ~ 1873 ) * no longer exists : [ studzianka ] ( https://tadeuszczernik.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/apc-2011-05-06-23-02-001.jpg?w=508&amp;h=530 ) ( also wooden tatar mosque ; built ~ 1817 , destroyed during ww i ) * [ pozna\u0144 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_poznaniu ) ( not actual mosque , just adapted building ) * `` muslim cultural centre '' ( okm ) in [ warsaw ] ( https://nowawarszawa.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10322751_672821592766545_4582229707931004552_n-770x578.jpg ) - ochota ( imho extremely ugly ... ) * planned in past : [ warsaw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wjpncdl.jpg ) ( design by polish architects stanis\u0142aw kolendo & tadeusz miazek from mid-1930s , not started before 1939 due to lack of funds ; location was the same as okm above ) * `` islam culture centre '' in [ warsaw ] ( http://images.polskaniezwykla.pl/user/item/195078.jpg ) - wilan\u00f3w ( again , ugly ), 
  mosque in piter [ looks stylish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_petersburg_mosque ) ( it was patterned after the tomb of tamerlane ) . 
   she took a french citizenship and polish one , when poland reappeared on the map . 
  point : she was both polish , and french . 
  wait , how it went ... strength through unity ?
