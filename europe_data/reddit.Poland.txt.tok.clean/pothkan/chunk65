  or something like that ? 
   what is that abomination in your flair ? 
  [ griffin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_the_pomeranian_voivodeship ), 
  and what , shoot people at them ? 
  as i said , ** latter solution ** - which mean doing something to prevent such migration ( or at least narrow it ) . 
   after centuries of being steamrolled , forsaken or traded away by germany , france and uk yeah , thanks roosevelt ... oh wait . 
  risking our position in the eu over quota issue is even more ridiculous and detached from reality . 
  either that , or doing something to prevent those `` nasty things '' . 
  i 'd prefer latter solution . 
  ignoring the problem would lead as nowhere . 
  * according to un data , first in gdp per capita . 
  * pretty much tiny monarchic switzerland . 
  * apparently only army , who went to war and returned [ in higher number ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/lhdm7/in_liechtensteins_last_military_engagement_they/?st=j3ky22mu&amp;sh=d4ef429f ) . 
  * granted asylum to [ small russian force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_russian_national_army ) fighting along germans in 1945 , while allies `` returned '' other such units forcingly to soviets . 
  there was a decent movie about it , * vent d'est * ( [ 1993 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vent_d%27est ) ) . 
  polish actor wojciech pszoniak ( probably best known for role of [ robespierre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgvbeosfle0 ) in wajda 's * danton * , and of course welt in * promised land * ) played `` bad guy '' , nkvd officer . 
  * apparently ( again ) changed their flag after 1936 olympics , because it looked the same as haitian one . 
  [ again , relevant polandball ] ( http://polandball.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/se3egyx.png ) . 
  * they recognized czechia & slovakia only in 2009 , because of [ some ownership dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_liechtenstein#international_dispute_with_the_czech_republic_and_slovakia ) . 
  * last european country to give women voting rights ( 1986 ) . 
  * had a [ nazi party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_national_movement_in_liechtenstein ) ( who did n't ? ) . 
  it was n't powerful , though . 
  7-8 liters here in poland . 
  bottled from shop of course , half that in pub . 
  actually we bordered hungary last time in 1938-39 . 
  via carpathian ruthenia . 
  we are growing , but at slower pace than few years ago ( under `` bad po '' ) , while there is actually a better economic situation around ( western and many other ece countries ' growth is better ) , so we should grow at higher pace . 
   lol i always thought irish counties and duchies are a great start too . 
  ireland is unoficially considered a `` tutorial island '' in ck2 . 
  great slice of life . 
  we need more of this from other countries . 
  what does it mean ? 
  paprika flavour is probably the winner one in poland . 
  cheese/onion is single contender , other are definitely less popular . 
  nope , czechs won most polls . 
  i remember only one , where italians wone , albeit slightly ( 1 % ) . 
  hungarians are high , but not at the top . 
  honestly ? 
  ** positive ** stereotypes . 
  average pole has very shallow knowledge about czechs ( or any other nation , actually ) . 
  so our view of you is mostly based on movies ( mostly comedies ) , jokes , and short tourist visits . 
  add to that some subconscious jealousy - that you 're more neat , `` western '' , progressive etc. 
  which makes mixed inferiority ( things mentioned ) slash superiority ( general size / military history ) complexes . 
  and tbh , `` most liked '' in our case kind of means `` less hated '' . 
  roughly 20 % of poles hate everybody else , another 20 % likes everybody else ( except gypsies & arabs , who get only 8-10 % ) , next 20 % does n't care at all , so all differences come to remaining 40 % . 
  btw , attitude to czechs is roughly 50 % like , 15 % do n't like , 35 % do n't care or respond . 
  slovaks & italians are slightly below , and everybody else even lower . 
   attribution of that decisions to hitler is an accepted fact for decades now and it derives from his experiences as a soldier on western front during wwi . 
  it 's not a fact , just a hypothesis . 
  popular and probable , but still . 
  there were also other reasons for not using gas warfare - mostly lack of trench fronts , often ending in stalemate . 
  there was no place for gas in blitzkrieg . 
   reminds me of this `` friend '' of mine who was overjoyed that geert wilders won ... about a week ago i had a conversation ( here in poland ) with one guy , saying that polls giving `` le pen 's party '' 15 % are a lie , and she will surely get more . 
  i did n't have a heart to explain , these are 15 ** seats ** , not percentage ... 
  later . 
  saying that kiev was `` center of russian civilization '' would be like saying that roman empire was part of the italian one . 
  however , it gets even more confusing and nuanced in russian and ukrainian debate , because there are e.g. 
  other words for russian language/culture ( russky ) and state ( rossiysky ) . 
   kiev was once the center of russian civilization ruthenian ( rus ' ) , not russian . 
  it means that largest number of people born in russia abroad is in ukraine . 
  however , this includes pre-1989 / 91 . 
  so it would count e.g. 
  somebody born in vladivostok 1955 , who moved to donetsk in 1980 , and stayed there . 
  pekin = beijing in polish . 
  weird error , as other names are english . 
  it looks slightly less bright irl . 
  * willingly atheist ; * jan hus ; and of course hussites , who kicked everybody around in 15th century ; * awful cuisine ( ray kroc was czech-american : coincidence ? 
  i do n't think so ) ; * but excellent ** and ** affordable beer ( especially non-bottled local brands ) * most liked nation by poles ; not sure if the feeling is reciprocal :( * good cinema ( especially czechoslovak new wave ) , often with interesting humour ( e.g. 
  * limon\u00e1dov\u00fd joe * ) ; * helena vondr\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 ; * czech language [ sounds kawaii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hiirm.png ) to poles ; * never fought germans in last 400 years , and still are in better place than us poles ; * [ jan palach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_palach ) ; * loved russia a lot ( but 1968 cured them from it ... at least we should hope so ) ; * first [ slavs on the moon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxlj30lz-a ) ( and actually [ third nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladim%c3%adr_remek ) in the space , after ussr & usa ) ; * * the good soldier \u0160vejk * ; * unlike poland , their borders are pretty much solid and in the same place since centuries ; * [ \u0160koda ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i1w0mvn.png ) , one of most popular car brands in the region ; * some good video games were/are made in czechia , e.g. 
  mafia 1 & 2 , arma , and ( currently in development ) kingdom come ; also trucking sims if you 're into that ... * had [ cool president ] ( http://inthefray.org/inthefray.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/vaclav_havel.jpg ) in the past ; now - not so much ; * cult animated series ( * krte\u010dek * , * rumcajs * , * pat & mat * ) ; * there was a [ czech navy ] ( http://www.martinships.estranky.cz/img/original/127/president-masaryk-06.jpg ) irl ( actually czechoslovak , but still ... ) ; * we ( and hungary ) [ backstabbed them ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/ilustrowany_kuryer_codzienny_3_x_1938.jpg ) in 1938 :(, 
  they are `` traveling '' . 
   `` savudrijska vala '' is rightful croatian clay . 
  that 's not even a clay ... 
  one atomic bomb too many :(, 
  what ? 
  whole issue at the beginning ( that ukraine was pre-invited to eu ) was the result of eastern partnership , started by poland and sweden , and eventually backed by germany ( which probably could not happen , if not for cordial polish-german relations under tusk ) . 
  same about sanctions against russia . 
  and now ? 
  when poland opens any initiative inside eu , who will listen ? 
  answer yourself . 
   criticizing some of the foolish eu policies problem is not in criticizing , but breaking rule of law ( cc , judiciary ) , and refusal to fulfill already decided policies - and yes , i 'm talking about `` refugee relocation '' . 
  not only poland has criticize this idea in the past ( pretty much whole ee did ) , but only poland and hungary is bashed now . 
  other countries accept their `` quotas '' , and guess what ... ? 
  those who came , dont ' stay anyway . 
  half of them run to germany etc. 
  in first weeks . 
  so whole our pettifogging is about an issue , which is next to non-existing . 
  and that 's because pis is using it for internal issues , just to switch subject whenever they are criticized for their ( other ) decisions . 
  and unfortunately , lots of poles are `` swallowing '' it gladly . 
   directly related to the security of the country but not defense . 
  macierewicz is n't minister of internal affairs . 
  killing is not . 
  but ** using ** this tragedy to gain political points is . 
  russian propaganda is constantly showing west as dying , suicidal , `` diseased '' ( by muslims , terror , gender , pc etc. ) . 
  pis ' propaganda is ( mildly , but still ) repeating the same narration - fearmongering , and posing themselves as `` protectors '' . 
  * `` you will never be a true pole '' . 
  * `` we will decide , if you are a pole '' * et caetera . 
  united europe is our best bet against russian imperialism . 
  pis ' policy is a sabotage , which ( unknowingly ) works in putin 's advantahe . 
  you heard wrong .
