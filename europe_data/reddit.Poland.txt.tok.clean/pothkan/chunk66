  they immediately started wave of `` tkm '' ( * teraz kurwa my * = now [ fucking ] us , term btw coined by kaczy\u0144ski himself in 1990s ) . 
  jk himself is rather ascetic , but everybody below ... po was `` happy enough '' to cover higher boards etc. , pis is replacing people to the lower levels , they even ousted managers not touched by all previous governments in ~ 30 years ( most known case were directors of state horse stud farms ) . 
  difference is indeed vague , but lies in the names . 
  nationalism gives a higher significance to a ** nation ** , which is an exclusive idea ( in the meaning , one is member of one nation ) . 
  while patriotism values * patria * , which can get different shapes - both country ( fatherland etc. 
  ) , city or region ( homeland , * heimat * ) , or even greater entity ( e.g. 
  europe ) . 
  you can be a double , triple etc. 
  patriot ( e.g. 
  parisian/french/european ) , but nationalism is `` singular '' . 
   the fact is that politics is one of ( if not ) the dirtiest games there is . 
  backstabbing or dirty personal moves between politicians are day like every day , true . 
  heck , even some level of corruption can be understandable ( it comes with the job ) . 
  but fueling hate and racism ... that 's another , very dangerous level . 
  not ignoring does n't mean we should fuel them . 
   whats wrong with nationalists ? 
  both two world wars . 
  and many other local ones . 
  nationalism is a cancer threatening our continent since two centuries , time to finally kill it . 
   you do realize that poland exists today because of nationalists who fought for their country you mistake nationalism with ** patriotism ** . 
  xenophoby can be selective . 
  and i do n't intend to say it 's prevalent in our society . 
  but pis ' narration both pleases those of us who are xenophobic , and fuels it among those who are n't ( or are mildly ) . 
  it 's very dangerous path . 
   but it was about safety/security , which was a common theme in the whole debate . 
  which has nothing to with defensive policy . 
  if it was b\u0142aszczak or ziobro instead of macierewicz , i 'd maybe agree . 
   but imo it was a smart political move smart , but dirty . 
  and dangerous . 
   it surprises me to hear serbia does n't want the republic of srpska . 
  probably same reason why albania does n't want kosovo , or romania did n't want moldova . 
  it would set them back at least few years in eu bid etc. 
  exactly . 
  alt - and far-right in modern europe is ally or tool ( depending on whether they do it willingly like e.g. 
  le pen , or unknowingly like pis ) of putin . 
  she says things sounding nice to nationalists and xenophobes , that 's all needed to please them . 
  and that shows what 's happening here . 
  she had nothing to say what could be used to defend macierewicz ( defense minister , debate was ** about him ** , opposition tried motion of no confidence ) , save few platitudes , so she switched subject to the refugees , muslims , `` end of europe '' etc. 
  plain ** fearmongering ** , slash red herring . 
  anytime anybody criticizes pis ' government for anything ( and especially if it 's eu , e.g. 
  during constitutional court crisis , or recent deforestation , and i 'm sure it will repeat when they start subordination of judiciary soon ) , this card was or is used in internal ( directed to poles ) propaganda . 
  unfortunately , it works . 
  [ kind of relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3d43hlyti&amp;t=3s ) . 
  with cameo of boris the \u0160a\u0161lik king . 
  jerusalem was in muslim hands for over 450 years at the time of the first crusade . 
  first crusade was response to call of byzantine emperor against seljuks , but nothing about holy land was mentioned there . 
  this was invented in rome . 
  and of course , if we talk about byzantium - remember 1202 . 
  on the other hand , muslims were n't innocent . 
  crusades were n't ** directly ** provoked , but previous centuries included christian-muslim wars ( although periods of friendly co-existence as well , e.g. 
  read about sicily ; there were long periods of peace in al-andalus as well ) . 
  both sides were at fault . 
  so while we can argue about `` unprovoked '' , it was definitely a ( christian ) imperialism . 
   crusades were unprovoked christian imperialism unfortunately they are quite right in this case . 
  crusades were jihad \u00e0 rebours . 
   the original video i even heard that man in the video was recognized as one of bosnian-serbian war criminals ( minor , but still ) . 
  i think he meant government of srpska ( bosnian serbs ) , not beograde . 
  does he even know what & where lithuania is ? 
  `` back then '' in this case is 2014 . 
  jaki 's father was appointed by opole 's mayor as president of city-owned firm . 
  i would love to be able to agree with you . 
  but i had seen this meme on different threads related to refugees , muslims in europe , turkey etc. 
  - and on the other hand , i heard people here in poland ( normal people with families , rl acquintances or colleagues ) saying refugees/migrants should be sunk in the sea , or shot on borders ... 
  does it mean i 'm afraid of people using this meme ? 
  hell no . 
  it 's innocent joke in 90 % cases . 
  but imho some `` spoon of truth '' could be a good idea . 
  and you are not . 
  it needs dispensation in catholic church . 
  exactly . 
  single marriage between close relatives is n't a big risk . 
  problem starts , when it happens many times in succeeding generations . 
  does n't fptp massively favours tories however ? 
  ukip had ~ 15 % , and they gained one mp in last elections ( and he was actually a previous tory mp in the same district ) . 
   poland should try it ... 
  it will eventually happen . 
   but why ? 
  because it 's hard to get ( free ) visit to the doctor in less than 3 days , especially after the weekend . 
  and the pill has to be taken under 72 hours from the intercourse - sooner the better . 
  `` kebab removal '' is n't funny memes about serbs . 
  it was this , in real life . 
  still , i 'm in better place to review it , than some random norwegian . 
  i 'm polish and i love the reference . 
  [ president of lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalia_grybauskait%c4%97 ) . 
  yup , that fanboyish smile is actually creepy . 
  okay , if `` new '' festival ( in kielce ? ), 
  will show lots of young artists , i 'd agree with you . 
  but for now , i bet there will be plenty of `` 50 + ers who performed during communist period '' . 
   he was a member of po few years before . 
  he is ( was ? ), 
  actually connected to patryk jaki , `` famous '' deputy minister of justice in present government - member of solidarna polska ( ziobro 's party , minor member of pis ' `` united right '' ) . 
  it was a series of following incidents . 
  and then the lavine started - which probably forced people involved to choose a side . 
  and decision of opole 's mayor ( who notice , was supported by pis during last elections ) was a nail in the coffin . 
  examples ? 
  except rodowicz , which i actually suppose was reluctant to opt out , and did it only because her mother died . 
  notice , that even kukiz fully supported this action . 
  ** le ** rosbif !, 
  rigas \u0161protes are great . 
  afaik islam in albania is rather cultural and weak .
