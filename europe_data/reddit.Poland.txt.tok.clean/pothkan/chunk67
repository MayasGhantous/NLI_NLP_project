  notice , that there was never inter-faith conflicts among albanians ( although many of them are catholic and orthodox christians , at least in albania proper ) . 
  i suppose they identify as albanians first , and religion goes somewhere behind . 
  compare to 4 for chicken breast , 5 for pork chop ( no bones ) , and 7-8 for beef ( haunch etc. 
   but avoid tuna !, 
  do n't eat tuna at all !!, 
  they 're dying and increasingly disappearing . 
  did n't it concern only some types of tuna ? 
  or all major ones ? 
   fish spoils very fast and in a very nasty way if not frozen or salted . 
  or canned ( which of course works only with some species - tuna , spraut , sardines , macarel ... ) . 
   because the catholic church is very reasonably pro-environment catholic church is also very pro-refugees . 
  actually even some polish bishops say what is francis saying ( although other say completely contrary things ) . 
  still , poles does n't care - overwhelming majority is against . 
  our catholicism is big on the outside , but actually very shallow on the inside . 
   has died than 22 young people violently on a concert . 
  and this is kinda fucked up . 
  that 's how many people die in poland in three days by road accidents . 
  of course , i feel for victims of this bombing . 
  and of course , targeting teens ' concert is sick . 
  but to be honest ... 
  i was more concerned about moore 's death too . 
  he was the best actor portraying here of cult film series - an icon . 
  keep calm and carry on . 
  no / s. 
  me too . 
  could somebody explain ? 
  * perkele * nightwish , apocalyptica , korpiklaani * puukko knife * mannerheim , winter war , * talvisota * 1989 , simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 * lakes , lots of lakes * poo-looking dish * hydraulic press * they need lots of personal space * darude sandstorm * saunas * koskenkorva ( and finlandia too ) * my summer car * [ metal dinosaurs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxhhlydysqq ) * armoured mobile phones * moomins * [ i do n't even ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhreqkrvone ), 
   another uk-born islamic terrorist who is probably the son of muslim parents if even . 
  rigby 's murderers were converts . 
  we do n't know how many attacks were prevented by police etc. 
  in the meanwhile . 
  they were even considered `` muslim croats '' , as ndh did n't recognize bosniak nationality . 
  yuge , r/the _ donek is blyatiful sub . 
  g\u00f3wnoburza would spell `` guvnobu ** \u017e ** a '' in croatian ortography . 
  i did n't say it was , just that we try to `` polonize '' such terms . 
   shitpost is `` cacapoteau '' or `` compost '' , crosspost is `` croixpoteau '' , etc. 
  heh , we try to use polish translations of reddit language as well on r/polska - e.g. 
  shitpost is * kupost * ( kupa = shit ) , * wg\u00f3rg\u0142os * is upvote ( w g\u00f3r\u0119 = up , g\u0142os = vote ) , circlejerk is * g\u00f3wnoburza * ( g\u00f3wno = shit , burza = storm ) etc. 
  poland has two major subs : * bigger r/polska , which is polish-language ( non-polish posts are of course welcome ) , mostly poles speaking about polish things . 
  community is left-leaning , but afaik that 's typical for national subreddits outside anglo-zone ( notice that r/europe is kinda left-leaning too ) . 
  * smaller r/poland , which is english-language , and attracts mostly expats or foreigners asking about poland . 
  sadly , sometimes it 's infested by r/the _ donald etc. 
  crowd . 
  ( helped by some supporters of our own ) . 
  there are some thematic or local polish subs as well , but afaik they 're all pretty much dead . 
  weirdly , map here links to smaller r/poland ( although it happens with some other countries to , e.g. 
  r/germany vs r/de ) . 
  thing is , they might not like chp/mhp even more . 
  it might be also because of fact , that kurdish identity was persecuted before erdogan , when republicans or military ruled . 
  it 's exactly the same in polish ( * drogi * ) . 
   do people like that ? 
  i hate it , and it was one of reasons why i do n't own a tv . 
  unfortunately , i 'm definitely in minority ( although it should change with generations ) . 
  and i think it 's inter-connected with low level of reading ( books etc. ), 
  here in poland . 
  and that 's the point . 
  pis is using this fear to cover up their misdeeds - both corruption , and worse , destroying the democracy . 
  there is a word for it - ** fearmongering ** . 
  turkey , not greece . 
   they built their first aircraft carrier !, 
  ** are building ** . 
  at least 4-5 years until it 's commissioned . 
  none of ee countries are `` enthusiastic '' about accepting refugees and quotas . 
  so why only hungary and poland are threatened ? 
  simple . 
  because refugees are n't a topic , but ** tool ** used by their governments . 
  bratislava , zagreb or sofia care about good relations with the west , so they at least try to `` proceed '' quotas . 
  probably with minimal effort , and weak will - just for show . 
  so why warsaw or budapest do n't act in the same way ? 
  because they then would n't be able to ** use it ** when being ( deservedly ) attacked for their undemocratic policies , like e.g. 
  subjugation of judiciary . 
  brussels threatens us with sanctions for changes to the constitutional court ? 
  they do it because we did n't accept `` refugees '' - that 's their message . 
  and of course now , when they are actually threatened because of that - propaganda will scream even louder . 
  because sheeps have to be kept in line . 
  if there were no refugees , they would have to be invented . 
  according to our `` right '' , everything is about r * ap * efugees ( / s ) now . 
   kaliningrad anyone ? 
  bombard the city k\u00f6nigsberg was severely bombed by ** allies ** ( raf as far as i remember ) , not soviets . 
  fact , that soviets did n't care to rebuilt it in the historical shape ( like we did , or at least tried e.g. 
  in wroc\u0142aw , gda\u0144sk or elbl\u0105g ) is another thing . 
   this sounds like such an insanely stupid idea . 
  in 1980s , yeah . 
  but do you think anybody would care about estonians ' opinion in the 1950-60s ? 
  so it depends when this idea happened . 
  [ cod wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ) . 
  `` we do n't have capitalist money , let 's pay with candybars ! '' . 
  true story , that 's what happened . 
  with power comes responsibility . 
  there is some visible anti-ukrainian sentiment ( mostly connected to upa and wolhynia massacre ; and of course fueled by russian trolls ) , but fortunately it 's marginal . 
  majority of poles view ukrainian migration positively , or at least do n't care . 
  it 's mostly connected to centum/satem [ hypothesis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centum_and_satem_languages ) . 
  you should look at grammar or root words ( basic vocabulary ) . 
  still , these are pretty subtle differences . 
   polish government also continuously accepts new refugees the traditional way continuously ? 
  numbers dropped since new government . 
  and they were pretty low even before that . 
  refugee status granted : 262 in 2014 , 360 in 2015 , 128 in 2016 . 
  asylum : 4 in 2014 , 56 in 2015 , 54 in 2016 . 
  do you honestly think , that accepting few hundred people annually is an enough `` excuse '' for a nearly ~ 40m country ?
