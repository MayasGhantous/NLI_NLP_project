   no , our government refused , along with other countries of the v4 as well as austria and denmark , to accept the automatic relocation of migrants ( not refugees ) . 
  there were two things . 
  first , relocation of refugees ( poland was intended to take ~ 10k , i do n't remember precise number ) , which was refused at once by slovakia and hungary , accepted by everybody else including poland ( kopacz 's government ) , and refused later by szyd\u0142o 's government . 
  and that exactly was the issue during election . 
  second , what you said - but it happened later , afair after the elections . 
   183 of then applied for an asylum . 
  627 applied , 183 received . 
   and we took a lot of greek refugees in 50 's who stayed actually majority returned in 1970s ( when democracy was renewed in greece ) . 
  minority stayed , mostly mixed families and younger generation ( already raised here ) . 
  ~ 600 of ukrainian citizens in poland applied for refugee status , 183 got it . 
  which makes less than 0.1 % of total number . 
  not even mentioning , that many ukrainians work here e.g. 
  only during farming season , and return home for winter . 
  source ? 
  according to official data , only ** 183 ** ukrainian citizens in poland were confirmed as refugees . 
  among ~ 1m of them . 
   because of the conflict ( war ? ), 
  they face . 
  very small part of ukraine is affected by war . 
  most of ukrainians come to poland just because even low wages here are a lot of more , than they can earn there . 
  it 's exactly like polish migration to west ( which started already in 1980s ) . 
   most me and african migrants are n't refugees either . 
  but our government refused to take refugees . 
  2015 quota was n't about `` plain '' migrants . 
   german chancellor merkel was thought russian in school as she was born in the former german democratic republic . 
  actually , she was born in hamburg . 
  moved to gdr as a toddler , however . 
  no , this is our secret space program . 
  put a cross on top , nobody would notice . 
  not directly , but further integration ( leading in far future to `` use '' , at least i hope so ) is considered by some ( on both sides , of course as a threat by nationalists ) as succession of national countries . 
  so it could be actually called ** post ** - nationalist . 
  [ polonia ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:polonia_ ( personification \\ ) ) . 
  nothing major , however - we never really cared about `` national personification '' , and if ever one have to be chosen , it 'd be just white eagle . 
  since nationalists are anti eu . 
   well , its a symbol for a pretty shitty religion . 
  it 's a ** piece of fabric ** , not a f -- g bomb vest . 
  to be considered a genocide , probably not . 
  but as you said above , `` genocidal ** attempt ** '' - yes . 
   somehow nobody had a problem with this for 15 years nobody ? 
  you forgot how ziobro used it in 2005-07 . 
  it was a major reason , why po did this reform . 
   while someone wearing a bear suit sneaks into his cab meh , day like everyday .

  beer is actually more expensive in russia ( compared to poland or lithuania ) . 
  and decent vodka is n't really much cheaper . 
  czech doctors , i bet . 
  beer is n't actually an unhealthy beverage . 
  definitely , much less than soda . 
  food going along with beer , however ... 
   edit : keep in mind it 's for 0.5 l i can buy 0.7 of good vodka for that price here . 
  poland confirmed philippines of europe . 
  ( btw , trivia : manila was actually called `` warsaw of asia '' during the ww ii , due to high level of destruction ) . 
  splendid ** est ** isolation . 
  debatable . 
  top notch of course , but there 's lot of competition . 
  while cuisine is nearly uncontested ( except french ) . 
  true , but same is pretty much everywhere else in europe . 
  hm , i digged a little ... and you 're right , it 's more resembling softened \u0448 . 
  so that would leave ukrainians only . 
  no , ** \u0449 ** = * szt * in bulgarian , not * szcz * . 
  but ukrainians do . 
  actually french people won eurovision most times - nine . 
  problem is , four of them did it for luxembourg . 
   i also do n't get it why everything has to be sung in english , it 's like they 're trying to be as forgettable as possible . 
  exactly . 
  i enjoyed eurovision in 90s , ca n't stand it since change . 
  tried few times ... one language makes these songs too similar . 
  36 songs from european countries , 33 of them in ** english ** . 
  diversity much . 
  am i the only one , who misses pre-1999 eurovision ? 
  because they did it `` qatar way '' . 
  all five luxembourg winners were actually foreigners singing in french ( and four were french , fifth greek ) . 
  why ? 
  you got into nato pretty fast . 
  ~ ~ russian ~ ~ ukrainian is even more efficient - one letter . 
   i keep messing up one consonant ... 
  try short stop in between , like `` polsh-cheesna '' . 
  actually , i do n't think existence of jesus or muhammad ( as historical characters ) is doubtful . 
  both were mentioned by sufficient number of sources , also outside `` holy books '' ( e.g. 
  believing they were messengers of some divine entity - this one is , however , entirely different . 
  it 's not exactly the same . 
  first , petru rather tried to ** go back ** to the roots of po , or even balcerowicz 's uw program - with strong liberal economics core . 
  macron seems to be more open here . 
  second , he just failed personally ( mostly because of clear lack of political experience ) , and became main problem of his own party . 
  plus we have a totally different situation now . 
  `` our '' front national is actually in rule , and ousting them is the main task of next elections . 
  is n't italy actually a main founder/trainer of libyan new coast guard ? 
   but there is only the 1915 . 
  [ not true ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamidian_massacres ) . 
  snow in may ? 
  last time i 've seen it was ~ 15 years ago . 
  i actually live 200 m from the photo . 
   and better vodka than poland nevah !, 
  but to be honest , cuisine is probably the ** single thing ** in italy , which is deservedly great . 
  defeinitely in global top 5 , probably best in europe . 
  triggered . 
  different hour probably . 
  wow , i live there . 
  like literally there , my building would be visible if photo was n't cropped .
