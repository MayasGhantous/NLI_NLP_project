  it was latvia before potato . 
  alands ? 
  there is snowing outside my window , and i 'm on the other ( southern ) end of baltic sea :8, 
   both france and the us use that system for their legislative elections . 
  difference is , that france decides in two turns . 
   eastern poland ? 
  by the way , did you invest ? 
  here is [ better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vrbdjfh.jpg ) copy . 
  and it 's a known trivia . 
  you 'll be eerily close to truth :|, 
   who says they 're going to end within the next 5 years ? 
  if they do n't , people will get used to them . 
  or maybe better word , resistant . 
  user flair checks out . 
  nobody cares about pakistan , except indians ( and vice versa ) . 
  you do have a special bond , 
   poland and the pis 2,5 years left . 
  only 2,5 years left . 
  imagine what it will be after american presidentials 2020 . 
  keeeeenya, 
   the top 5 worst subs on reddit are all american-centric . 
  can you say which ? 
  i guess the_donald is one of them . 
  i 'm asking just to know where to not go ... 
   pork schnitzel is right-wing , and salad is left-wing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawrlvoqqss by the way , [ mrw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hiirm.png ) i read czech wikipedia description :  v\u00edde\u0148sk\u00fd \u0159\u00edzek je tence rozklepan\u00fd pl\u00e1tek z telec\u00edho masa , balen\u00fd v trojobalu a osma\u017een\u00fd na p\u0159epu\u0161t\u011bn\u00e9m m\u00e1sle nebo na rozp\u00e1len\u00e9m vep\u0159ov\u00e9m s\u00e1dle .

  is it proper french ? 
  l'huge !, 
  wait , they are trying to influence ** french ** with memes in ** english ** ? 
  seriously ? 
  are these guys for real ? 
  where do you even get a dried dick ? 
  we poles have one with denmark . 
  it 's not even about a land . 
  i guess they did n't find anything really useful , so decided to throw whole pile of shit now , in the hope that anything fake thrown inside wo n't be disproved in time . 
  but i honestly hope it will blow in their ( kremlin / fn ) faces . 
  seriously , it 's so blatantly obvious . 
  our ( polish ) `` 2014 tapes '' , brexit , usa 2016 - these are just episodes of a wide operation . 
  zzzzzz ... 
  actually our stereotype of american tourists is rather positive . 
   fun words , like defenestration especially fun in czechia . 
  do n't bother , it 's a red herring topic . 
  or/and duda tries to show that he matters . 
  which he does n't . 
   oh you lived through the re-denomination , how was that ? 
  fun , when i received my first wallet , it quickly got thick full of banknotes . 
  everybody was a millionaire then . 
  ( un ) fortunately i do n't really remember actual inflation ( which happened roughly 1987-90 ) . 
  and to be honest , i think that showing polish 90s as `` horrible '' period is an overstatement . 
  sure , it was much worse than now ( on the other hand , there was some `` crazyness '' , because of changes everywhere around ) , but it was n't bad . 
  of course it depends what exactly you keep hearing ... 
  i do n't . 
  and actually growing up in early 1990s was fun . 
  nope , but he works on it : https://www.google.com/search?q=ko%c5%9bci%c3%b3%c5%82+maryi+gwiazdy+nowej+ewangelizacji+toru%c5%84&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x, 
   there is no room for catholicism , islam , evangelicalism or any other religion . 
  there has to be , because forcing somebody to not believe just does n't work . 
  you can not ** enforce atheism ** . 
  some people will never be able to accept it . 
  that 's why we should focus on ensuring , that religion has no supremacy over civil ( state ) law . 
  not on eradicating religion itself . 
  i do n't mind religious people doing stupid or weird things , as long as they do n't try to make me ( or anybody else unwilling ) to do them . 
  live and let live , period . 
  he said insufferable , not wrong . 
  i never said it was a good idea . 
  unfortunately , it 's an epitome of good style for some people . 
  in 1984 , i was born , 
  both , sb was a service under msw . 
  but of course i mean that it was ( most probably ) made by some sb officers ( topped with deputy minister milewski ) , behind the actual minister kiszczak ( who remember , was an `` outsider '' there , as he came to msw from the army ) . 
  you still hope they will pay debnts ? 
  how cute ... 
  true , but 1 . he was killed for preaching against state , not being priests ; and 2 . it was considered an unlawful killing even at the time ( it was `` inside job '' at internal ministry , precisely general milewski , maybe even in connection to soviet security - but as far as we know , without knowledge of jaruzelski 's or his circle ) . 
  i think somebody could actually made a b class horror movie out of this idea ... 
  we do , and they are called libraries . 
  because some marian apparitions apparently happened there . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  think about it like a catholic disneyland . 
  probably because he was widely known already as prince william , and it sticked . 
  a [ shephard ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/miko%c5%82aj_sikatka ) had revelations about the mary in the 1850s . 
  something like fatima . 
  and also never acknowledged by vatican , but this does n't matter here - polish catholicism is ** crazy ** about marian apparitions . 
  all of them . 
  seriously , that was the plan . 
  and i 've heard it 's even uglier inside . 
  i hope you 're not serious . 
  according to interview with architect ( she 's from my city ) , she tried to make it `` eclectic '' . 
  effectively , it ended a inedible mashup of different styles . 
  still , poland was sole country of communist block , where church was ( post-1956 ) generally independent . 
  and actually after 1970 state even resigned to build new churches . 
  true , sale already happened in tehran . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basilica_of_our_lady_of_liche%c5%84 ) description . 
  according to various lists , it 's 6-7th biggest and 11th tallest christian temple in the world ... 
  first , we do n't use `` q '' . 
  second , way too many vowels . 
  third , i think `` kshduieieieiieieieieieiieieikalalalla '' might be finnish . 
  but you tried , and it counts !, 
   for all her faults merkel projects a strong image of quiet competence . 
  i always view her a something solid . 
  you know , a product you buy in hope it wo n't break in a year or two . 
  like a fridge or dishwasher ( which i both have made by a certain german company , by the way ... ) . 
  i ca n't wait until our elections in 2019/20 , if they try something similar supporting pis .
