  what if they were going to fight ** against ** isis , e.g. 
  in ypg ranks ? 
  there was an entirely different variant in poland : two dogs meet at east german-polish border , each one going to another side . 
  `` why are you coming to us ? 
  '' , asks ddr dog . 
  `` to eat as much as i can '' - responds polish one - `` and why are you to us ? '' . 
  `` to bark as much as i can '' , says ddr dog . 
  it 's a joke about relatively high level of freedom of speech in poland ( in 1970-81 period ) , but bad supply of food etc. 
  - and contrary , good supply & low freedom in ddr . 
   `` why would they do that ? 
  they do n't even know me ! '', 
  there was a similar joke ( with different items ) about ethiopia . 
   i mean department with parliamentary staff/civil servants who write analysis about foreign policy/current events and publish them on parliament 's website . 
  you mean ( state ) foreign affairs think-tanks ? 
  then it has nothing to do with parliament . 
  both are government-affiliated ( not parliament !, 
  because that 's a problem mostly in usa , not europe . 
   airbus would 've built another factory in poland . 
  it would create whole bunch of new jobs , the whole supply services for it . 
  but pis was always in the usa pocket . 
  it 's not only `` being in the usa pocket '' , rather more of `` being in trade unions ' pocket '' , in this case of mielec factory . 
   lol ... swedes seem to be pedants . 
  calculating interest rates , inflation etc. 
  just write that debt off . 
  why , it 's funnier that way . 
  i bet nobody in stockholm expects this debt to be paid ( and swedes would surely write it off , if kim 's regime would fall ) , but it became kind of hillarious tradition . 
  `` hey guys , it 's time to send you know what to pyongyang !, 
   but it has a very strong rule of law . 
  and very low corruption ( although some nepotism is kind of a thing there ) . 
  it 's an unique model of softly authoritarian , but self-limiting technocracy . 
   i would say the jury is still out in whether the chinese system worked . 
  and even if it worked - there 's a question , if it 's transferrable anywhere else . 
  because these ratings evaluate rather government bonds prognosis , not economy per se . 
  so we agree to disagree , again ( i 'm sure both of us had similar conversations elsewhere ) . 
  like there 's two polands . 
  which is a single entity enjoying the mess pis is doing with poland and eu . 
  so you agree , that pis , kukiz & korwin are part of the same group . 
  actually , it 's `` if you are not against us , you are with us '' - that 's pis pov of kukiz/korwin . 
  quote by hungarian communist leader janos kadar , by the way . 
  polan digs much coal polan stronk dont need econazi green energetiks . 
  ( / s of course ), 
   yeah , one could almost say we have a front of national unity here , do n't we ? 
  even if you depict kod as `` parties '' committee ( which it really is n't ) , participating groups gathered ( in total ) 45 % of votes - more than pis . 
   i had a chance of seeing prominent po politicians associated with those demonstrations . 
  that does n't mean they 're power in kod . 
  only that they hitched there . 
  it would be suprising , if they did n't . 
   i 'm a non-pis supporter , and you wo n't hear anything positive about kod from me . 
  if you voted for kukiz or korwin , you count as poputchik . 
   it 's been two months and i already want to get off this ride . 
  we have to hold out , and they have to bleed out . 
  we have to let them entangle themselves , drop under 20 % . 
  elections before 2019 could mean , that pis could come back later . 
  by the way : szyszko is a hunter , and was opposing a law ( in late parliament ) which was to prohibit taking children for animal hunting . 
  bu there ** is ** a woman . 
  there is a husband-wife-child family in spot , and gay guy plays santa . 
   so this means that this time poland is actually attack the radio station ? 
  and with german tanks !, 
   i wish , but he 's serious . 
  i honestly do n't understand his popularity among younger poles . 
  however , he always ( i.e. 
  since 1990s ) had high support among ** any ** younger generation , e.g. 
  often won secondary school `` caucuses '' ( among non-voting pupils ) . 
  and of course he 's famous for winning internet polls , and having big audience on facebook etc. 
  it 's only four years . 
  they won under extremely lucky circumstances ( ~ 15 % votes under the threshold , big difference between 1st/pis and 2nd/po result ) , getting 52 % seats with 39 % votes , under 51 % turnout . 
  unless pis increase its support - which is hopefully very doubtful - they will lose in 2019 . 
  our situation is often compared to hungary , but orban 's fidesz is in much better place - in all late elections they had 45-53 % of votes , under 60-65 % turnout . 
  so orban has support of ~ 33 % eligible voters , while kaczy\u0144ski only ~ 18 % . 
  and honestly , if we compare orban to kaczy\u0144ski ... viktor is suddenly not so bad . 
  pis leader might be praising orban , but in reality he 's rather imitating erdo\u011fan . 
  yeah , but names tend to differ , depending on place . 
  which is actually understandable , looking e.g. 
  at different names of similar clothing in british/american english , or even same word meaning two different things ( e.g. 
  jumper ) . 
   really , you 've frequently seen this in london and luton ? 
  burqa is a synonime for niqab in many countries , e.g. 
  india or gulf . 
  what you shown is an `` afghanistan burqa '' , which is actually called `` chadri '' in afghanistan , and - here you 're entirely right - not used anywhere except this country , some parts of afghanistan and may be ( in past ? ), 
  india . 
   burka being banned wo n't happen simply because it 's not really much of a thing here . 
  it 's a red herring case anyway . 
  in france ( where they banned niqabs few years ago ) there was only a few thousands of women wearing them ( among few millions of muslim women ) , and actually quite lot of them did it entirely voluntarily , sometimes being even a french-converted-to-muslim . 
  kind of `` rebelling youth '' / `` convert zealot '' thing . 
  there are more serious problems with islam in europe , than some piece of cloth . 
  but these ca n't be solved with easy ban . 
  in poland there are actually already some talks about similar ban , although i doubt if there is a single woman wearing faceveil in whole country . 
  hijab alone is a rare sight here . 
   how is it with those new mixed dialects ? 
  it 's just `` standard polish '' . 
   has lesser polish any influence of ukrainian ? 
  none . 
  however , during 2nd republic it was broadened : `` proper '' lesser poland was called `` western lesser poland '' ( ma\u0142opolska zachodnia ) , and western galicia/red ruthenia ( dominated by ukrainians , although with few polish-majority cities , especially lw\u00f3w / lviv ) was called `` eastern lesser poland '' . 
   but de jure krak\u00f3w remained the capital until partitions , despite having no political significance any more . 
  it had only symbolic significance - all polish kings except stanis\u0142aw i and ii , and of course russian emperors , were crowned there . 
  last one was august iii in 1734 . 
  actually , this map is pretty fetched . 
  nearly absolute majority of poles speak `` standard polish '' , mostly due to post-ww2 migrations , suppression of any regionalisms during communism , and domination of central media ( tv , radio ) then . 
  there are actually only few exception : cashubian , which is actually a separate language ; upper silesian dialects , sometimes considered a separate language as well ; highlanders ' dialect , preserved mostly because of tourist purposes ; and rural polish/belarussian mixed dialects in few parts of ne poland . 
  but there is no noticeable differences between polish spoken in e.g.
