  especially if they involve googletranslate english  polish . 
  it got to be hilarious . 
  let 's say you are a voter with a political opinion different , than overwhelming majority of people in your area . 
  liberal in ( generally conservative ) texas or podkarpackie ( province of poland ) . 
  in podkarpackie , your vote would still count towards overall result of your ( liberal ) party . 
  actually , even your candidate could still end an elected mp , because there are multi-candidate electoral districts here . 
  of course same with president - your vote matters . 
  in texas , your vote does n't matter , period . 
  your district would elect conservative congressman or senator , and your state a conservative president . 
  you might just stay at home and do n't bother . 
   would you want the most populous major cities on the continent ( likely in germany/france ) to decide the outcome of an election that affects you ? 
  yes , i would . 
  mostly because than people would have to group based on their actual opinions , not nationality or place of birth . 
  he 's actually one of most `` worldly '' politicians in poland . 
  conservative , but definitely pro-strong eu ( deeper union ) . 
  unfortunately , he 's kind of arrogant prick ( although it 's very overblown in our media ) , which makes him a solist . 
  trivia : he received world press [ photo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anne_applebaum ) award in 1988 , while [ reporting ] ( http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3301/18771686.73/0_8ae42_d0fe7e4f_orig.jpg ) from afghanistan war for british press ( from the mujahedin side ) . 
  and [ his wife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anne_applebaum ) got pulitzer price for a book about soviet gulag system . 
  which was a sea . 
  but then dutch came . 
   if kaczynski does n't like then he should leave the eu . 
  i agree , but only if he leave us poles behind . 
   why did he pick poland ? 
  he mentioned poland along with hungary , russia and ( afair ) turkey . 
   but like what is his problem ? 
  that we no longer want to hold onto european values , while still taking western money . 
  it was before the smolensk . 
   he holds power over a 50 000 man militia that only answers to him which thankfully exists only on paper . 
  what we need , is a radical revision of financial copyright laws . 
  imho strong reduction of protection period ( from ~ 50-70 to 10-15 years ) would be a good start . 
  * were our vassal for a short period ( and some parts were even part of commonwealth ) * [ zdob si zdub ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjx8io1nxg ) !,

   but pirating is stealing no , it 's not . 
  if you steal a movie dvd , somebody loses it . 
  if you pirate a movie , nobody loses it . 
  in first case , owner of a physical item ** is ** harmed - in second one , owner of rights to the movie ** could be ** ( because he lost potential profit - potential , because pirating something does n't mean one would purchase it in rl ) . 
  of course it does n't make pirating not illegal . 
  it 's still a crime - but a different , definitely lesser one . 
  neither she did in saudia . 
  and then we all will be happy in cozy russian embrace . 
   but i remind you that clinton was also a 100 % winner before us elections . 
  and she ** won ** popular vote . 
  which contrary to weird american indirect system ( electors etc. 
  ) , can be predicted efficiently . 
  much will come to actual results during election . 
  remember , that pis gained single majority due to some `` lucky '' results - not only sld & razem ending under threshold , even korwin getting in would mean < 50 % of seats for pis . 
  there are still some unknowns , especially left - polling together around ~ 10 % . 
  it could be a viable coalition option for po ( otherwise than . n or psl ) , although not easy one ( probably comparable to kukiz for pis ) . 
  pretty much yeah . 
  people does n't believe ** in ** them longer , and switch back to po - mostly because getting rid of pis is viewed as crucial task , and po seems to be most viable option here . 
  exactly . 
  polish , ** i\u015b\u0107 ** ( to go , imperfect ) / ** p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 ** ( perfect ) : ** id\u0119 ** ( i 'm going ) , ** p\u00f3jdziemy ** ( we 'll go ) , ** szed\u0142em ** ( i was going , masculine form ) , ** posz\u0142y\u015bmy ** ( we went , feminine ) , ** b\u0119dziecie szli ** ( you will be going , plural masculine ) . 
  and then there are e.g. 
  conditionals , like ** poszed\u0142bym ** ( i 'd go , masculine ) . 
  same in slavic languages . 
  exceptions are a rule there  and remember , everything has a declension . 
  you get a declension , and you get a declension , everybody gets a declension !, 
   hungarian ai n't got nothing on japanese or chinese , where the alphabet itself and the grammar are both horrible to learn . 
  actually grammar is extremely simple in chinese , and not bad in japanese ( unless you want to profficient , but same could be said about other languages - e.g. 
  i still did n't grasp forms like future perfect ) . 
  however , other than writing system , you have ** tones ** in chinese , and different `` readings '' in japanese ( that 's why learning just spoken language is much easier , than even basic profficiency in written one ) , or complicated `` polite '' forms . 
  to be honest , you 'd still need : russian ( still crucial in majority of ex-ussr countries , and useful in few countries like bulgaria or cyprus ) ; portuguese ( because brazil ) and japanese ( because let 's be honest , bilingualism is n't stronk in the land of rising sun ) . 
  or any slavic ( germanic , romance etc. ), 
  language , because then it 's easy to learn another one . 
  and another . 
  is that hungarian * kurwa * ? 
  but what if you 're friends with this wife too ? 
  in the end it 's hard to stay on best terms with both sides , you 'll probably have to choose one . 
  would you e.g. 
  invite both on your birthday party ? 
  not you , geese in ports . 
  eastern dialect of brazilian . 
  many of us do . 
  officially , i 'm afraid not . 
  naaah , 10-15 % at best , 
  heh , we have a saying here `` leaving like english '' ( * wyj\u015b\u0107 po angielsku * ) . 
  it means you leave unnoticed , furtively , without any goodbyes . 
  edit : i digged deeper ... and there 's even a [ diagram ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cwetwpl.jpg ) showing how various nations name such * faux pas * . 
  on the other hand , pis + kukiz ( which is still more probable to form coalition with pis , than po etc. 
  - although it would be a pain in the ass in any ) is still roughly equal in polls to anti-pis ( po , . n , psl and left ) . 
  pis lost few % recently , but let 's be honest - po coming back to top is because they `` consumed '' . n. 
  there is nearly no pis/po voters flow , polarization is stronk here . 
  i 'm talking about the ideology . 
  ustasha , onr , oun , iron guard or arrow-cross party all belonged to `` wide '' camp of radical totalitarian nationalism , with strong influence of religion ( maybe except oun ) , italian fascism , and `` blood & soil '' concept . 
  you ca n't call ustasha nazis just because they made mass slaughtering . 
  of course , it does n't mean that it makes them `` good guys '' , au contraire . 
  we all know what ustasha , oun ( wolhyn cleansing ) did , and what garda de fier or nykp tried to do ( or did ) during their short periods . 
  that 's why imho it would be a safe bet to say , onr would do similarily awful things , if they had comparable numbers and power . 
  do n't blame courts , but faulty law . 
   if you want to defeat extremists , prepare when you have an economic crisis . 
  exactly . 
  refugees and terrorist attacks are actually only a secondary reason here . 
  it 's still about 2008 crash , or more broadly - failure of neoliberalism ( in economical and social issues , not worldview ones ) . 
  because they use name `` national radicalism '' instead of `` fascism '' . 
   the falanga wing split from the onr because of various disagreements . 
  which were personal ( too many f\u00fchrer-candidates ) and tactical ( cooperate or not with ozn ) . 
  ideology stayed similar . 
  what do you not understand in the word `` could '' ? 
  some vague hints are in * miasta \u015bmierci * by miros\u0142aw tryczyk ( which unfortunately is very `` safe '' , and contains mostly related sources , without deep commentary ) . 
  and there is a pattern - parallel pogroms in latvia and eastern galicia were made by local fascists ( oun of course in second case ) .
