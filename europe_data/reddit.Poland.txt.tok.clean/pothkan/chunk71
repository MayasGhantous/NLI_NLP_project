  but i 'd guess somebody would have to research onr members in this area ( pre-1939 ) , and compare with perpetrators of pogroms . 
  some , not most . 
  on the other hand , people from rnr tried to start a pogrom against warsaw jews , around easter 1940 . 
  and there are some hints ( more research is needed here ) , that ex-nrists could be involved in summer 1941 pogroms ( jedwabne etc. 
  to be honest , onr is n't really a problem here . 
  they are tiny , no more than 2 or 3,000 people ( at best ) . 
  what 's worrying , is that our present government does n't mind them parading legally . 
  this manifestation was n't allowed by city ( mayor ) , but decision was overturned by * wojewoda * ( province governor , appointed by national government ) . 
  even worse - they had police protection against `` leftists '' . 
  true , because they were ( pre-war ) in many aspects ** worse ** ( than bnp or italian fascism ) . 
  onr was a `` native '' polish fascism , very similar of croatian ustasha or romanian iron guard . 
  this comparison is ... disturbingly correct in present times . 
   so what 's the point of being in the eu if you are not relevat even as a member ? 
  because you 're more relevant in the world as member of big united community , than as single sad alone c * o * untry . 
   seems like terrorist attacks had huge effect on eu . 
  trust is lower in the south . 
  i do n't think terrorism or refugees are crucial reason , i 'd rather say it 's still about post-2008-crisis fallout . 
  convenience flag . 
  ship was ( i guess ) actually turkish . 
  yeah , but pis has single majority due to difference over po in 2015 . 
  smaller difference = no majority for pis . 
  even if they win ( based on present polls , things would be probably worse for them in two years ) they would need kukiz to form a coalition . 
  local in 2018 , parliamentary sep/oct 2019 ( and of course ep in the meantime ) , presidential circa may 2020 ( with probable tusk 's comeback ) . 
   mrs szyd\u0142o could join them too if she likes . 
  but we north/western poles do n't wan na !, 
   it has to do with their profession . 
  but nun itself is n't a profession . 
  sure , nun can be e.g. 
  a nurse or teacher , but then these professions mandate no such uniform . 
   that 's a profession . 
  professional uniforms are one thing . 
  of course , there 's nothing religious in nun habits . 
  what about nuns ? 
   no need to ban them . 
  problem is , some politicians want this . 
   just associate them with oppression and backwardness . 
  but ... why ? 
  why should we care what somebody wants to wear ? 
  it 's not our business . 
  hijab ( and more often , niqab ) is viewed in west as a symbol of backwardness in islam ( because it 's visible ) , but do women in muslim countries ( or even more , muslim women here ) really mind it ? 
  imho there are more serious issues we should care about , like their access to education , financial independence , or ( in case of saudi arabia ) driving . 
  but what happens , when woman herself wants to wear a hijab ( of her own choice , not forced by another man ) , and somebody ( e.g. 
  state in europe ) do n't allow her to ? 
  who 's oppressing who there ? 
  banning headscarves is just bad , as making them obligatory . 
  no state law should mandate what a woman can or ca n't wear , period . 
  yeah , but catholic women are n't even obliged to wear it everyday , and we are comparing special visits . 
  imho it 's a matter of being polite - just like donning a ( even paper-made ) cap in synagogue , or taking shoes off in mosque - as a tourist . 
  what about headscarf during visit to pope ? 
  seems that catholic women wear it . 
  i recall only merkel among stateswomen not doing it , but she is n't catholic . 
  it 's just like people saying `` i 'm not an antisemite , but jews/israel ... '' .

  probably * the goths * and * in britain * . 
  or actually , most of stereotype-probing ones , including self-laughing * the banquet * . 
  sadly , two gauls never visited wendish lands :(, 
  two other american author series i did enjoy : * queen & country * by greg rucka , and * y : the last man * by brian vaughan . 
  him too , but my favourite american comics author is stan sakai . 
  notice , that both are n't us-born ( moore is english , sakai japanese ) . 
  and there 's also irish garth ennis ( * preacher * ) . 
  of course , fact that such talented people work in america , says something good about this country . 
  among `` full '' americans , probably bill willingham ( fables ) . 
  still , in general imho european  american here . 
   there are some parts of britain where muslims are majority example ? 
  anything more than some cities ' districts ? 
   women covering their faces is a cultural issue , not a religious issue . 
  it 's both , mostly because religion is part of culture . 
  remember , that there 's no single interpretation of this certain issue . 
   ha ha yea , fuck those 500 people who now wo n't be able to pay their mortgage reliably it 's not us ( eu or poland ) who is to be blamed here ( but company itself ) . 
   american comics became whole fanchises with the heros being templates for writers to work with . 
  true , that 's probably i never could get into american comics , especially whole heroes genre ( maybe except ** few ** batman ones ) . 
  these few us comics i do/did read , all are one-author title . 
  started two world wars . 
  habsburgs . 
  especially nice during fin-de-siecle . 
  krak\u00f3w still loves them . 
  creepy guys with cellars . 
  freud . 
   vladimir putin was the handpicked selection of yeltsin rather his daughter 's . 
  putin was a guarantee , her and her friends crimes ( corruption ) wo n't be charged . 
  yeltsin was delusional ( literally ) in last years of his rule , due to health problems ( honest ones , he had a hereditary heart condition ) . 
  his circle keep him `` going '' publicy-wise thanks to painkillers etc. 
  chechnya was already de facto independent after 1st war . 
  there would be no 2nd one , if not for putin . 
   he consolidated chechnya ( which regardless of what we think about it , was terrible for russians who remember dead conscripts and terror attacks ) . 
  thing is , he started it ** himself ** . 
  i mean 2nd chechen war . 
  = polan stronk . 
  there 's something uncanny in this smile . 
   it 's normal for belarus to be known for tractors when its dictator used to be the director of an agricultural farm . 
  is n't it a positive view , however ? 
  afaik , belarusian automotive industry is actually the most successful whole-ex-ussr-wide . 
  i even noticed maz buses here in poland few times ( and our market is highly competitive because of strong local companies , like solaris or solbus ) . 
  [ mfw ] ( https://img.memesuper.com/dfb9ca2e38532ca258739c5bb6bc8ef2_-like-a-sir-in-hd-like-a-sir-meme-hd_787-1010.png ) but seriously , are polish investments in moldova so widely noticeable ? 
  and what are they ? 
  awww < 3 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 !, 
   expect a le pen surge along with more attacks . 
  isis 's goal is to ensure she wins , and they 'll pull out all the stops going into election day . 
  ** this ** . 
  stay safe and calm , france .
