   what 's up with the loans in swiss francs ? 
  yes , what ? 
  what does it has to do with po ? 
   if you want poland , your own ountry , to be stripped of army , degrading healthcare , making unprofitable deals and just not being able to say no to any other country , go ahead , vote for po . 
  i want strong european federation , made of societies working for common good . 
  not bunch of falling apart , isolationist states . 
   but i 'm trying to convince you that po is worse than you think . 
  do n't bother , i already know they are a lost cause . 
  they are ** past ** . 
  should n't we talk about present now ? 
   it was payed by the country and the only thing a supervision would change was to not give back citizen 's their money and shut down skoks faster , or keep on paying from governments money , which happened . 
  it would stop transferring money by skok ( kasa krajowa of senator bierecki ) out to luxembourg . 
  and in effect , prevent at least some falls . 
  btw , next skok ( w\u0142oc\u0142awek ) is falling just now . 
   you seems blind to what 's going on and defend your beloved party . 
  beloved ? 
  i believed them in 2005 & 07 , in 2011 voted only to prevent pis , and could n't even do that last year ( although it was clear they could n't do it again , anyway ) . 
  but it was n't corruption , what drove me away . 
  they stole - yeah , so what ? 
  they 're politicians , that 's what ( some of them ) do . 
  pis & aws were/are the same , and sld & psl were even worse . 
  it is n't a major problem . 
  but ** lack of vision ** was . 
  they burnt out . 
  or rather did n't bother with any vision , because they were so sure , that fear of pis will always give them a victory . 
  that they are too big to fall . 
  that they are ** entitled ** to rule . 
  and that lead to ** arrogance ** and ** lazyness ** . 
  they had a * golden horn * , and they lost it . 
  but honestly , if there was a chance , that they could win against pis in october - i would vote for them again . 
  because i do believe in idea of ** lesser evil ** . 
   no matter how hard you try i will never believe that we lost billions of billions because they were stupid . 
  oh boy , are you naive . 
  billions of billions of money are lost in any democracy . 
  i 'm sure our foreign friends can point examples from their countries . 
   do n't really know what 's worse . 
  i know . 
  present government . 
   also , any skoks should be put down , whilst money should be given back to polish citizens ( they were anyway , so it was n't a hard thing to execute by po especially that they were in power ) . 
  there would be no skok falls , if they would be put under knf supervision earlier . 
  they were n't , because pis politicians resisted it yet during lech kaczy\u0144ski presidency . 
  there was , and probably still is , a complex scheme of pis , skok , affiliated firms ( including media ) , and some law chancelleries . 
   also they did not steal millions . 
  neither did nowak 's watch , or sikorski 's meals cost millions . 
  hey , i have no problem with po losing . 
  change was needed . 
  but why for worse ? 
   you must objectively admit they have lost huge part of their followers of course , i even admit i was among them . 
  i voted for po three times in row ( 2005-11 ) , but not last year . 
  first , because they became unable to stop pis from power . 
  tl ; dr - they outlived their usefulness . 
  second , because they became too lazy . 
  lacked any vision , any new ideas , any solutions for new problems . 
  most of these cases prove no corruption . 
  `` just '' incompetence or thriftlessness . 
   now pis increases the gas extraction along with lng terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie which was built during po rule . 
   do n't tell me that others did the same , it does n't prove anything , it just says not only po is bad , and i did n't say only they are at fault . 
  i only said that pis is doing the same ( single skok scandal is worse , than any of po ones - numerous but not as serious ) . 
  so why it won now ? 
  both parties are corrupt . 
  if we want to purge corruption , we have to give politicians less ways to get corrupted . 
  less state-owned companies , more clear auctions , independent courts and prosecutors , et caetera . 
  you seriously believe pis will achieve that ? 
  because imho their policy is exactly contrary . 
  also , po was often depicted as corrupt alike to sld , or even worse . 
  they were angels compared to thieves from sld . 
  remember starachowice ? 
   if you think that acting quickly and not sweeping scandals under the carpet makes a party great and flawless i feel sorry for you . 
  i do n't , i just point that they lost also because of this unability to crisis management . 
  compare it to `` madrid trio '' scandal in pis - kaczy\u0144ski extinguished it quickly and effectively . 
  po was often portrayed by pis as `` masters of pr '' , while in reality they were deeply incompetent in this field , and eventually outmatched by pis . 
  disproportion between pis and po campaigns in 2015 was just a final blow . 
   this still a very distant future , but in the long run the usa is really the only ally we have , sadly in the long run our only hope is to take part in building strong europe . 
  and that means its major countries ( germany , france ) should be our main allies . 
  usa ? 
  yeah , of course , good relations are needed . 
  but they are far , far away . 
  and he actually was going to start his campaign for reelection this day . 
  this was a strongly political flight . 
   that beloved po party was corrupted to the core comparing po to corruption of sld ( ruling 2001-05 , fell under really serious charges ) , it 's scandals are actually laughable . 
  meals on public cost , expensive watches not listed in property statements , et caetera ... 
  however , po on one hand played this cases wrong ( not acting quickly , sweeping under the carpet ) , and pis & its media on other hand managed to blow it out of proportion . 
  although pis had its own scandals in the meanwhile ( e.g. 
  whole skok affair , communal nepotism in wo\u0142omin , or madrid trio ) . 
  please wait , it will only be four years . 
  tl ; dr we rose from our knees , but fell on our head doing so . 
  but most of them are `` celebrity papers '' , tabloids and regional journals . 
  without significant impact on public debate ( exception : newsweek ) . 
  titles best known for being pis enemies ( e.g. 
  last one is even self-owned , being a rare case of successful cooperative . 
   outright stole private retirement funds . 
  they ** never were ** private . 
  problem is that nobody bothered to show it clear , already during aws reform in late 1990s . 
  and po did n't either in 2014 . 
   if your beloved civic platform was so great how come current goverment does not even need coalition to be able to have majority in sejm ? 
  because of our electoral system , where number of deputies is depending not only on given party result , but also results of other parties , how many of them do n't cross electoral threshold , and how wide/narrow is difference between various results . 
  ** examples ** : * 2001 : sld won 41 % of votes and 47 % of seats * 2005 : pis 27 and 34 % * 2007 : po 42 and 45 % * 2011 : po 39 and 45 % * 2015 : pis 38 and 51 % as you can see , pis won ** less votes ** ( in percentage ) than po both in 2007 and 2011 , and also less than sld in 2001 . 
  however , due to different factors ( mainly big difference between pis and 2nd/po result , small between 2nd/po and 3rd/kukiz , and unability of lewica & korwin to cross threshold ) , it gained ** majority ** in sejm . 
  okay , i agree , but what that has insulting religion to do with wearing niqab ? 
  i 'm pro ( freedom to do ) both , btw .
