  i thought it may be because of regulations , but i ca n't find anything about that at the moment - i rather see it 's just cheaper for developers . 
  electric ovens used to be seen as an expensive choice , but now with induction stoves afaik it 's pretty similar or even cheaper . 
  it 's ok for food that we cook . 
  i have n't heard anyone complaining that they ca n't have gas stove to be honest . 
  most seems to prefer it . 
  more and more people do n't eat at home anyway and from what i know even more in west europe . 
  oh my , you 're asking difficult question on 1:30 am after few beers , but ok . 
  so for me prague was lovely , but i got this feeling that it was only about this lovely square . 
  the bridge was crowded totally and people somehow managed to create total jam in the middle of it . 
  the castle looks lovely from far away , but nothing spectacular when you 're up close . 
  i do n't usually visits museums , so i ca n't tell , but i do walk a lot and while it was lovely the budapest just felt better . 
  in budapest i just liked more places . 
  we stayed in jewish quarter and it was lovely . 
  then you can go towards river and just sit there , both on day , but at night it 's even better . 
  the tram by the river is nice . 
  you can just sit by the river at evening and watch the other side of it - citadel , the bridges , castle hill , bastion . 
  during the day you can of course go to the other side of the river and visits all those places . 
  from there the parliament looks lovely . 
  i do n't know , it 's just better for me , as a guy who just likes to walk around the cities that he visits . 
  did i mentioned [ k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs ] ( http://haveblogwilltravel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/chimney-cake_mini.jpg ) and [ tokaji ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tokaji ) ? 
  not lesser known , but a lot of people will say prague much much faster than budapest . 
  personally i think budapest is much better than prague . 
  well , i do remember you ran to germany , because you were too frightened about what 's our right wing is doing in poland when in reality this image of sky falling here is created by media , so i 'm afraid you 're exaggerating about the immigration problem now too . 
  eu has population of 500 millions , i doubt 50k people were affected by terrorism , crime or rape . 
  not only we only have few scary big forest animals , but also they 're rare or not that scary . 
  boars are dangerous , but so common that people forget how dangerous they can be . 
  they come from forests nearby cities to the cities and sometimes wander around it . 
  i spotted few some time ago while running at late evening by the river 2km from city center , and my city has 600k population . 
  bears and wolves on the other hand are super rare . 
  if you go hiking chances of spotting them are low since they do n't go too close to tourist paths which are usually pretty crowded since our population/places to hike ratio is rather high . 
  poland ( and i guess most of the europe ) is densely populated and roads are busy even at night , so surely you 'll see deer at night by the road from time to time , but comparing this to what i saw on my trip in us is nothing . 
  while driving at evening in north central states ( south dakota etc. ), 
  we 've seen so many deer by the roads we decided not to drive at night at all since it seemed to risky . 
   99.99 % is a slight exaggeration not at all, 
  so your family left italy over 100 years ago and you expect someone giving you citizenship ... sounds silly . 
  i like the one that we use that in fact originated from german : _ tu le\u017cy pies pogrzebany _ - _ hier liegt der hund begraben _ - i guess it could be translated to - _ here the dog is buried _ . 
  it 's a saying when someone has found the reason of a problem . 
  muted red ? 
  like [ this ] ( https://i.snag.gy/jkeks4.jpg ) ? 
  i took it when i visit us . 
  we of course were also driving a car with the same color . 
  ca n't tell what 's popular in poland , but certainly not this . 
  25 in summer is considered normal , at least in pozna\u0144 . 
  today is 22 and it 's rather chilly for summer . 
  when it 's 28 we consider it a hot day , but it 's not unusual at all in summer . 
  32 is something not too common , but we do expect at least 2 weeks in summer with that temperature . 
  when it 's 35 everyone talks about it . 
  [ sauerkraut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sauerkraut ) and kinda similar cucumber version [ og\u00f3rek kiszony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_cucumber#/media/file:og%c3%b3rki_kiszone.jpg ) . 
  from sauerkraut we make [ bigos ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigos#/media/file:bigos_in_a_cafe_at_wawel_castle.jpg ) . 
  besides that [ kaszanka ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaszanka ) looks pretty awful . 
  maybe not at a first glance [ as a sausage ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaszanka#/media/file:krupnioki...jpg ) , but you do n't eat it as a sausage - you rip it and put it [ on a plate ] ( http://agattek.blox.pl/resource/kaszankatalerz.jpg ) . 
  well , so france does it too and poland also . 
  maybe only us celebrates in the morning 25th ? 
   poland does n't eat till evening 24th and then we do n't eat meat except fish . 
  carp is a must for most families . 
  some families like to be progressive and chose different fish though . 
  you can get 30 days jail time for that . 
  those are the moments when i 'm glad i 'm from filthy barbaric eastern europe, 
   inaccurate : i do n't think that we do n't have a sense of humour hehe , that 's a good one, 
  national id is the primary id here . 
  used for voting , identification in banks , post offices , etc. 
  [ example ] ( https://mswia.gov.pl/dokumenty/zalaczniki/1/1-21911_g.png ) many people have passports , but mostly those who travel outside eu . 
  national id is accepted by uk , so you do n't need a passport . 
  you also do n't need one when travelling to bosnia and herzegovina or montenegro . 
  i 've also been to georgia and they accept our national id - no passport needed . 
  driver license is not considered to be a valid id in poland , so you wo n't be able to use it when it strictly says that id card is required ( so no banks , post office or any government administration stuff ) . 
  besides the fact people dress for the season you might take into account that some nations that live in warm climate for thousands years may not feel so hot as others . 
  i 've been to indonesia and saw people wearing jackets at 32 c ( 90 f ) . 
  i think / u/vertitto is on point . 
  exactly what i think and feel towards this party and their stupid populist ideas , but the issue is not only overblown by foreign media . 
  it 's also overblown by polish media ( except public ) and polish left wing . 
  i disagree with almost every idea they have and i 'm strongly against their attitude towards pretty much everything , but while i have to agree their actions regarding constitutional tribunal are worrying in the end they were chosen in democratic elections . 
  everyday life did n't change here . 
  opposition still blames the government for everything and sees the end of the world , government still makes horrifying decisions and no real reform . 
  well , this one is in the city center , pretty ugly [ dom ksi\u0105\u017cki ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1w-kepkvlrq/vmqtafb_yni/aaaaaaaafve/ssx1ut3rvvu/s1600/dsc_4368%2b ( large \\ ) . jpg ) , but this [ 5-building complex ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/alfa_poznan.jpg ) is also pretty bad . 
  i like modernism and i think it would look nice if only they would clean it . 
  [ they did it with one ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/ef/f7/f6/z16185327q,budynek-alfy-na-rogu-sw--marcina-i-ratajczaka.jpg ) and it does n't look that bad . 
  well , i like the one in which i work : [ okr\u0105glak in pozna\u0144 ] ( http://www.arup.com/~/media/images/projects/o/okraglak/okraglak2_900x600.ashx?mh=800&amp;mw=1000 ) and it 's [ over 50 years old ] ( http://r-scale-bf.dcs.redcdn.pl/scale/o2/tvn/web-content/m/p1/i/0c9ebb2ded806d7ffda75cd0b95eb70c/a6122f14-a7b2-11e4-8b2a-0025b511226e.jpg?type=1&amp;srcmode=4&amp;srcx=0/1&amp;srcy=0/1&amp;srcw=640&amp;srch=360&amp;dstw=640&amp;dsth=360&amp;quality=80 ), 
   i 've always heard that american cars are huge compared to european ones not only cars, 
   # 100 here it 's maybe around 20-25 gbp for cleaning or simple fillings in private practice . 
  100 gbp should be enough root canal of 2-root tooth in private practice . 
  if you work then you have national health insurance . 
  if you lost job and you register as unemployed you 'll also be covered . 
  any other pole correct me if i 'm wrong , but afaik you can get to er for free , you can get to gp for free and if there 's something wrong you go to gp and you get a referral for free . 
  so i 'm not sure what are you talking about . 
  the problem is that many times there 's a big queue to gp , so you lose a lot of time and then you get a referral to other doctor and depending what 's wrong with you the queue may be counted in days , weeks or months . 
  i 'm talking about queues to specialists for surgeries or something like that . 
  i had nasal septum surgery . 
  i had to find a clinic with relatively not huge queue and it was a bit further from where i live . 
  i had to wait 2 months . 
  it was free . 
  but for some people going 70km to other city for surgery might be expensive enough to wait in bigger queue in their city . 
  oh , on top of that you 'll many times end up in bad looking hospitals in a room with 7 other patients and the quality of food will be laughable . 
  quality of many things will be laughable . 
  it just depends where you end up . 
  so private clinics have also signed contract with our national health insurer and you may end up in a nice , clean clinic . 
  generally it 's bad , but it 's much better than 15 years ago . 
  tv shows - maybe stuff like hell 's kitchen , although we have our own version . 
  i do n't really know which foreign version is shown . 
  mtv shows translated version of sweet 16s or stuff like that .
