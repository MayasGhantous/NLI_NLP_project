and paintbrush in polish is * p\u0119dzel * . 
  * dz * is the voiced counterpart of * c * . 
  whoa . 
  i got excited ... :d, 
  we 'll also see it going away ... 
  i hope . 
  and vice versa . 
  * some people are so poor that the only thing they have is money . 
  but lack of it brings sadness :(, 
  that 's my favorite thing since the french teenagers who took a llama on a tram ride while drunk . 
  * whoa * , forget * central * europe !, 
  estonia , you forget * nordic * ... we can into * smarter * europe !, 
  yep . 
  i 'm polish and i just broke my tongue . 
  here 's my way : say french * je * + english * chocolate * , then lose * - ocolate * . 
  ** edit : ** add * poss - **** po **** - lee-tah * . 
  short * o * . 
  poor hitler rolls in his grave , all his effort in vain . 
  there * was no * poland then . 
  ( what was not directly incorporated into the reich was [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_government ) . 
  and there was no polish [ government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_government-in-exile ) . ), 
  same for the period of the partitions . 
  i 'm not sure about wwii , but judging by gays being sent to camps alongside jews , slavs and roma , probably illegal as hell . 
  and 1795-1918 it was illegal for sure , but then good luck finding poland on any map back then . 
  same goes for corporal punishment in schools . 
  we banned this in 1783 , first in the world , * woah , we so cool * , but then came the partitions and ruined everything for the next 123 years . 
  it 's like every progressive thing we did got slaughtered in its infancy . 
  that 's frankly kinda frustrating . 
  nope . 
  i am a lifelong volleyball fan and got fed up with football supporters telling me how our victory over brasil in the recent world championships was useless and they 'd care more if the football team defeated the germans even by sheer luck in this game , and how it would be * more worthy * than the volleyball team winning the whole mundial 'cause volleyball is some pseudosport no one cares for . 
  i heard that a few dozen times and i got really worked up over all of this because i * really * like * reaaally * love volleyball and the damn f #ckers were ruining my bliss , so i had this bright thought : * oh , i hope they 're gon na lose , and lose high . 
  it 's germany they 're playing so a defeat is pretty safe , right ? 
  ... right ? 
  * not to mention their referring to volleyball fans as * janusze * ... they pissed me off so much i had to re-watch all thirteen matches to calm down ... , 
  the first time i * wanted * ^ 1 them to lose they had to pull off a friggin ' historic 2:0 , * of course * ... if only i 'd known earlier that 's all it takes ... . 
  ^ 1 i had a * decent * reason , but now i kinda ca n't help but grinning ;d ... like an idiot ;d ;d :d, 
   `` it was never our intention for any animals to feel uncomfortable because of their natural behaviors , '' the zoo said in a statement . 
  priceless . 
  he 's not . 
  and ski jumping is right behind . 
  i 'm not joking either . 
  ** pooolaaaaaan the stroooooonkeeest !, 
  ** also , congrats to germany !, 
  love your golden shirts . 
  ** poland ** we 've got a new prime minister . 
  it 's a [ she ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewa_kopacz ) . 
  and a bunch of other ministers . 
  we 're into the volleyball men 's world championship final against brasil . 
  [ hope it will end up better than the last time i saw that one ... ] and we defeated russia in the process and the gas still flows . 
  truly a happy day . 
  well , let 's hope he 'll go down without a big * boom * this time ... 
  * `` we wants it , we needs it . 
  must have the precious . 
  they stole it from us . 
  sneaky little ... '' *, 
  now i have * too * high expectations . 
  thankfully , i also have some delicious blood sausage in the fridge . 
  just got ta get a rid of the dog so that i do n't have to share ... 
  * aww * , czech always so cute :3, 
  wow , you must have a really miserable life . 
  i pity you . 
  next stop : space . 
  this picture is going to make it into history books , and will confuse the hell out of future generations of students . 
  many times while in high school i was staring into my history textbook and thinking : * what the hell ... but that does n't make any sense ... why did they ... it 'd be easier if they just ... jeez those people back then were weird ... * and so on and so forth . 
  i 'm glad i wo n't have to wrap my head around that one ... not that i wo n't try but ... and on a side note , it 's scary how little have changed , it seems people will never learn . 
  i used to think war in europe was impossible . 
  * never again * . 
  and i 'm not talking about ww3 , just about what 's happening now . 
  a year ago it would 've been unthinkable . 
  two years ago donetsk hosted uefa euro 2012 and now donbas arena got hit by fucking artillery shells . 
  and we * know * russia has its part in all of this and ... * nothing * . 
  what . 
  the . 
  fellow . 
  humans . 
  all of this is all kinds of ridiculous ... ^ i 'm ^ gon na ^ go ^ ranting ^ somewhere ^ else ... 
  my grandma is 84 , she 's been saying that * the end is near * for the past twenty years ... grandpa 's two years older but not nearly as eager to die as his wife is . 
  and the other pair of my grandparents made it to 89 and 86 . 
  i think i 'm safe . 
  though , i was always convinced i 'm not gon na make it to thirty . 
  now i 'm scared i will ... ;d . but , * hey * , they say i 've got my grandma 's character so it should be fun !, 
   poland also protested because they were not depicted in the joke . 
  checked . 
  i actually laughed out loud ;d, 
  i love the [ slovak ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_cl5frpijc ) one . 
  you 're an evil , evil man !, 
  now i 'm sitting here , watching gummi bears , and feeling * old * ... thanks . 
  * edit : or more accurate version : * if god is with us * , who 's with them ? 
  and tennis . 
  i bet someone 's getting a crash course in diplomacy over that . 
  i 've always thought that ambassadors , consuls , attach\u00e9s , and other embassy employees were the only politicians you could really call * diplomats * and here they keep ruining my last positive vision ... vide [ hungarian ambassador ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bogp3/hungarys_new_ambassador_to_italy_thinks_jews_are/ ) to italy . 
  did they just ... is it just me or is that about one human being being * superior * to another just because of race ? 
  i think i saw [ that one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ) before . 
  israel , what the hell ? 
  how is this even real ? 
  * is it ? 
  fifty frenchmen but twice as many * people * . 
  i know this is / r/europe but ... 
  oh , germany , do n't lose hope !, 
  one day you 'll be able * into joke * too .
