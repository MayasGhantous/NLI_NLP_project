  i remember a bunch of random facts like that peter the great was unusually tall and * stood out * . 
  or that tsarevich alexei had hemophilia - queen victoria 's fault [ i had a pretty awesome biology teacher in high school , she 'd get oot pretty quickly and pretty awesome ] . 
  catherine the great had * a thing * for the last polish king - since even before he bacame the king , the fact that she 'd kinda helped him and not without profit is another story ; they had also a daughter . 
  ivan the terrible was , well , terrible , the oprichnina . 
  vasili shuiski - this one was adventureous . 
  boris godunov - we really pissed him off . 
  [ come to think of it , i guess shuiski did n't like us either ... ] gorbachev 's wife was raisa - common thing in crosswords . 
  smolensk - it 's funny how history had once started there , then ended , there was turbulent and ended once again . 
  okay , * umm * , i 'm tired at the sheer thought of the amount of things so ... 
  i 'm just gon na say it : randomly , or not really : the rurikids - the first ones , fyodor i , boris godunov , time of troubles , the dymytriads , dmitry pozharsky , vasili shuiski , the seven boyars , w\u0142adys\u0142aw iv vasa , mikhail i , the romanovs - the last ones , rasputin .

  the alexandrov ensemble - they 're adored here , also , vadim anayev . 
  the bolshoi theatre - they 're adored everywhere ? 
  aleksandr domogarov was rather popular here . 
  [ the reason ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=bohun&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=rnufupqgk8mthqfcrig4cw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cdwqsaq&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=694 ) . 
  our anna german was rather popular there . 
  as much as i * hate * to say it , they have pretty awesome national anthem . 
   you do n't go on youtube to watch what they got on their dashboard cameras . 
  you just do n't . 
  that steals time . 
  every time . 
  and then some . 
  also their vodka is second best ... :d in comparison , we 're the lgbt heaven . 
  it took me an hour to list all of this , i 'm not gon na lie , i want my karma . 
  also , sure as hell i forgot a lot of stuff . 
  not purposely , i mean . 
  * do swidania !, 
  the white hand is the scariest thing in the picture . 
  '' * right ? 
  there 's another one i like by [ cyprian kamil norwid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprian_norwid ) : * `` polacy s\u0105 wspania\u0142ym narodem i bezwarto\u015bciowym spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwem . 
  '' * [ the poles are a wonderful nation and a worthless society . ], 
   i ca n't tell what you mean ? 
  did you mean that as a question ? 
  well , i thought you 're making a tasteless joke or are just biased ; you could just flair up to avoid confusion in the future . 
  as a bulgarian you can complain all you want . 
  [ hell , i 'm polish , complaining is our god-given right , if not an obligation ... kind of a national sport ]  i inherited like a half a dozen houses without internal plumbing . 
  and they are all in remote villages which have already lost so much population that they could honestly be considered abandoned . 
  but i still ca n't afford a good apartment in sofia . 
  i find it hard to believe because usually even when the builiding is shitty the land it stands on is worth a lot more . 
  that 's the case even in the middle of nowhere in poland . 
  [ that i find something hard to believe does n't mean it 's not true , of course ] also , in all of these countries at least half of each population , if not more , lives in an urbanized area [ ca n't find the source right now , but it was on / r/europe not a long time ago ] , so the fact that there can actually be some villages with crappy houses without internal plumbing that are being inherited in large amounts would n't account for that high percentage for the whole country . 
   many of which do n't have running water . 
  you missed the memo it 's the 21st century * everywhere * ? 
  from his other posts i gathered that he does n't seem to be polish himself so i 'm not sure what were his intentions , but from my polish point of view i can tell you that if you read his post with the * sarcasm glasses on * , you 'd get a perfect picture what an average pole thinks . 
  whether they 're religious or not is irrelevant . 
  an * average * is a key here - not far - * whichever-side * , not a religious fanatic , not a bully loose from the leash . 
  and then if you were n't sure whether it was sarcasm , you should 've lost any doubts at * `` best patriots on earth . 
  '' * the nationalists have mouth full of grand words and ideas . 
  patriotism . 
  faith . 
  nation . 
  god . 
  right . 
  and that 's just it : words . 
  it 's * acta non verba * , after all . 
  also , religion and values it represents do n't really correlate with what 's in the pictures . 
  sad thing is they 're not even religious fanatics , just giant hypocrites . 
  people who do n't respect other people , their fellow nationals , their own country and the laws their own god [ they love to highlight that ] had established , call themselves * true patriots * and * real catholics * . 
  at the same time they offend the rest of their nation who think that beating other people and setting things on fire is n't the best way to show that you love your * patria * , and * love thy neighbor * . 
  or that you * do n't * , as the case may be . 
  the pope says homosexuals are people too , respect them as such !, 
  but * nooo * - * the great polish patriots know better !,
