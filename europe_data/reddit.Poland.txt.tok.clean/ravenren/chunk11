  * * kill them all !, 
  * [ i find it funny , i 'm not religious at all but i really like this pope ; of course he 's not * right * enough for our dear * patriots * ... ] the word * patriot * is not as appealing to me as it used to be anymore . 
  and at the , i hope , * slim * chance that / u/saldejums thinks all the poles are racist homophobic bullies with torches on a witch-hunt [ as seen at the pictures ] , i can assure you we 're not all like that , that 's just our far-rights , or far-lefts , depending on the occasion . 
  they love to be heard and seen . 
  they 're like that little dog that barks the loudest and poops the biggest . 
  and everybody has to hear and smell . 
  at this point even the biggest dog-lovers are pissed . 
  and if it helps they do n't hate just russians , or gays , or muslims , they also hate their fellow straight poles as you can see on provided pictures , whether you 're on the left side , or not enough on the right side does n't matter , if you 're not blood hungry and ready to * kill * * in the name of god * for what they think is * normal * , you 're an enemy . 
  at this point , i think it 's safe to say what 's already been said in a numerous threads covering this subject - they hate everyone , but they `` entitled '' to - they 're `` catholics '' and `` patriots '' and they just `` do what needs to be done '' . 
  * as an average pole [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hwllpqm.jpg ) just hurts me . 
  and i think it should hurt every pole , even those who really * are * deeply religious and have a problem with gays ; i mean a problem in the privacy of their own mind not on the streets with a baseball bat . 
  because the issue here is not that it 's a * rainbow * that burns , which may or may not have a dual symbolism . 
  the issue is that they had set part of their country on fire , hurting fellow poles in the proces , and counted that as an accomplishment and source of pride . 
  the problem i have here is that there 's a number of people who , let 's call it lightly , are not fond of gays but would n't actually do something to hurt them or offend them in person , and who would n't vandalize the rainbow or anything , and these people wo n't stand up to those bullies and extremist because they agree that the rainbow * should n't be there * . 
  they say they do n't approve vandalism and are outraged by what had happend in warsaw but it 's * good * that the rainbow is gone . 
  and by that they give some sort of silent permission to what the far-rights do . 
  that 's dangerous . 
  and that personally pisses me off the most . 
  they could be counted as the * live and let live * types but they 're happy someone took that decision off of them . 
  it 's like the fifth post i 've written on the subject , i bet i 'm being repetitive already , but my need to vent is still there ... also , apologies to anyone who still likes the word patriot in its original meaning , and to all the catholics who live and let live . 
   poland 's constitution defines marriage as being between a man and a woman . 
  that 's not exactly an anti-homosexual law . 
  it was n't formed directly against homosexuals . 
  i find it rather a matter of technicality , i.e. 
  unfortunate wording , than an outright defiance . 
  whether they did that on purpose or just accidentally is another matter . 
  and , yes , i think this * could * in fact * be * accidental - our current constitution was written in 1997 - the left-side was in power then , that 's one thing ; the second is , gay rights were n't that hot topic then as they are now , so i guess they could just * missed * that ? 
  i do n't know , i guess i 'm just hoping they did n't do this on purpose all those years ago . 
  but what he said is that poland is one of the few countries in the world [ earlier wikipedia had stated the only one ] where homosexuality was never criminalized , i.e. 
  illegal and penalized . 
  apart from getting married lgbt people can do pretty much everything that heterosexuals can do . 
  all you need is a visit to a notary . 
  it does n't of course change the fact that is could be a lot of easier , but it 's not impossible nor forbidden . 
  and , for the record , i 'm wholeheartedly for gay mariage . 
  * shh * , you should look dangerous and threatening and ... * i do n't believe i 'm saying this to a german * ... just keep up appearances !, 
  elections are coming . 
  now they 'll have a chance , * again * , to show what they 're worth . 
  oh , i 'm naive , are n't i ? 
  i 've always wondered whether those guards in front of embassies are * ours * or the guests ' . 
  thanks for enlightenment . 
  this is just sad . 
  the worst thing is the guy in the picture is so proud of himself and thinks he 's such a great patriot . 
  that 's a really patriotic thing to do - to burn and destroy your own capital , to tell the other half of your countrymen they 're not * real * poles , to offend and hurt , because surely you are the only one with exclusiveness for truth and patriotism , and then wave the flag as if he 'd actually conquered something . 
  oh , and they obligatory terrorized some innocent guard of the russian embassy who was guilty of just standing there . 
  but , * hey * , he was russian so setting his booth on fire is so patriotic ... * so much pride * . 
  so , basically , our patriotism consists in showing that we 're bunch of animals who when given the possibility , i.e. 
  power , will destroy themselves . 
  i believe otto von bismarck said sometihng along those lines some 150 years ago ... ca n't help but wonder . 
  of course i 'm a patriot , good thing love is blind ... 
  that makes two of us . 
  this is perfect . 
  those things exist in everyday life not just at this particular march . 
  you just proved my point - anyone who dares to say something not favourable about them ends up as the bad guy . 
  they are never the bad ones . 
  they just point who is ... 
  hm , let 's see , the members of the main right-wing party openly call the left side parties communists on various occasions . 
  everybody who does n't agree with them ends up as a nazi . 
  since they must be all kind of worst they sure all are gay . 
  and * gay * is the worst offence in that book . 
  come to think of it , i like their idea of the feminists better - all the feminists are sure lesbians who want to use in vitro fertilization just so they could have an abortion . 
  oh , i 'd forget , all of those are obviously paid by the government to do all those outrageous things , and all of that is meant to destroy them and their one and only proper point of view/ideology/religion / nation . 
  and they just have to defend themselves . 
  with stones and baseball bats . 
  from literally everybody ... love all the way around . 
  you can put it this way , sure , but the thing is - in poland people automatically associate nazism with the nazi germany . 
  period . 
  while fascism is n't connoted with italy on the spot . 
  however weird that sounds . 
  i guess it 's not that clear from the outsider 's point of view but that 's the case . 
  also our , let 's call it , * `` true neo-nazis '' * those who call themselves that , they cite hitler , they shout `` heil hiler ! '', 
  i 've read once an * article * written by one of those who stated that hitler was right murdering the jews and we should bring gas chambers again to * clean the place * [ from the * wrong kind * of poles this time ] . 
  he said that as if completely oblivious that the poles were in the exact same place in that picture . 
  [ the main reason i 've read this thing was that i had some faint hope there will be some reason in it , some sense . 
  i did n't find any . 
  just the opposite ] they themselves do n't know what you 're talking about here ... and that 's even more ridiculous than what i said before . 
  if i may : [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermenschen ) . 
  poles on the first position . 
  it 's illogical . 
  [ edit : i meant the first apart from the obvious ] i 'm not saying there 's any logic in what they 're doing anyway . 
  in fact , it makes no sense just as much , but it 's * `` we '' * who call them * nazis * , they themselves would n't because they are * `` the true poles '' * and just the opposite in thier view - * `` the most polish poles '' who 'll save poland from all the nazis/communists/whatever * ... so , since it 's * `` we '' * who call them that , * `` we '' * do n't want to be illogical , whoever those * `` we '' * are . 
  i 'm using this as in * we not them * , if that makes any sense . 
  if you have to put a name on them , they 're closer to fascism than nazism . 
  and i think this applies to all the countries you listed . 
  for me a pole with a swastika tattoo is not a nazi , it 's * a nazi wannabe * and monstrous idiot who 's dumb enough to not being able to realize that it 's impossible . 
  no such thing in nature . 
  it 's almost like * poland can not into space . 
  *  like a black man shouting * white power * ... 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  also , the nazis had a certain ideology , however outrageous it was , and those people here , i do n't believe they have any , you need brains for that . 
  anyway , it 's just my take on this , i might be wrong , or biased , or hopeful , or whatever ... edit : spelling, 
   many polish nationalists dislike russia they hate everybody and everything . 
  i 'm kind of convinced they hate even themselves . 
  if you 're not with them , you 're automatically a nazi/a communist/gay/government / another imaginary enemy ... take your pick . 
  and i 'm just a lefty patriot whose heart aches watching what these creatures do to my country . 
  not sure what does that make me anymore ... 
  i figured that once you understand enough that you 're able to be annoyed by poor subtitles you do n't need them anymore . 
  at that point i switched to transcriptions and then i stopped using any subtitles altogether . 
  if something 's not aimed at children and dubbed , it is done this way and for us it 's perfectly normal . 
  i bet it 's strange when you 're not used to it but , * hey * , i thought it was totally weird when i found out that there are countries where they dubbed something that 's not for kids - it was kinda terrifying when i once stumbled on grey 's anatomy with italian dubbing . 
  i remember my first thought was , * jesus christ that shit 's terrible ... * :d as to our version i think it beats dubbing any day , you can hear the actors ' voices , their tone , the emotions and you understand even if you do n't speak the language - most lectors have voices that blend pretty well .
