  there 's one i ca n't stand but others are really good . 
  actually some of them have somewhat cult status right now . 
  i 've seen a documentary on them once on youtube . 
  pretty awesome to see faces behind the voices . 
  there 's one lady [ ladies in this business are rare ] that 's always linked to documentaries on nature , she has a reaaaly steaaady monoootonous voice - it 's a running joke around here to compare various boring events to her performance . 
  but there are also some pretty awesome ones - i guess which one you choose is a matter of personal taste - i always liked the guy who read * columbo * , to the point that i 'd be skimming through channels and then i heard some random fragment of some random movie and i 'm like * oh , that 's this guy , ok let 's listen * but as you get involved into a movie you stopped notice the lector , but you 'll recognize the voice right away if you hear it in some different setting - an add or sth . 
  brain 's a fun thing !, 
  and last but not least - once you get your language skills to the level when you understand the actors - you 'll hate every lector . 
  but that 's due to poor/incomplete translations . 
  seriously - it drives me crazy when actor has some long intresting line and here comes the lector with some simplified shit that 's not correct nor funny . 
  * i bet the majority if not all of polish redditors here can hear the voice in their heads when they read : * czyta\u0142 tomasz knapik * . 
  ;d ** edit : ** also , i have to state this - polish dubbing of disney 's animation and similar is absolutely awesome , especially songs . 
  there 's the whole community on youtube that indulge in watching those vids/songs in different languages with english subtitles and compare voices , lyrics , meaning - which are different in every version . 
  it stole me a few nights . 
  who would 've thought pocahontas in german is such a a cool thing !, 
  we call that * dark blond * , it 's a little lighter than * light brown * ...  but seriously , most blondes i know here in poland are dark blond , this lightest , let 's name it , * `` swedish '' * blond that you called * `` real '' * is rarest . 
  and those dyed ones are usually bleached with dark roots , the one in the photo looks pretty natural and i bet it is . 
  awesome . 
  i think it was more of a warning than an information about traffic as such ...  the video was shown last week in a conference where the ministers of environment in the region of baltic sea and a bunch of other professionals were discussing how to protect the vulnerable and polluted sea in the future . 
  * ministers of environment * and * pollution * . 
  so i do n't mind the dramatic approach , and even if that was a little * too much * it still does n't change the fact that the video is nicely done - that 's all i said , 
  neatly done !, 
  i meant it as a nice thing !, 
  not the * not-so-nice * one ... , 
  glad we could be of service , 
  * hey * , we have this one too  * chuj mnie to boli * - meaning and translation exactly the same . 
  actually , * chuj * is totally universal in polish it 's almost like a masculine version of * kurwa * ... ** edit : ** * how many ? 
  - * w chuj . 
  * [ indefinite but * a lot * ... ] * how was it ? 
  - * chujowo * [ dick-ish - really bad ] * what about * sth * ? 
  - * chuj wie * [ dick knows - it 's impossible to know , or you do n't know who knows so you ca n't ask them ... ] * how far ? 
  * [ really really * really * far away ] * * chujnia * - * n. * dick * ness * - [ a state of things when things are * chujowe * ... ] just a few examples off the top of my head , 
  * um * , no ... what the argument was about was that he missed the line with proper translation [ dick i care - i do n't care ] and he thought the translation from the last line was the only one i provided and he stated that 's bullshit which would 've been correct if that was the case , except it was n't because i properly translated it two lines earlier and the latter was just a funny addition as it was meant to be . 
  as for the walking around vs. walking around - i was actually thinking about it as in walking in circles which i stated , * again * , in the last line of my first post , but the other meaning also fits the joke . 
   baba z wozu koniom l\u017cej - literally `` the woman is off the cart - it 's easier for the horses '' , used when you are happy that someone backed off from participating in something you did n't want him to participate in . 
  a russian friend already beat you to this one a few posts below  * chujem gruchy obija\u0107 . 
  * [ to knock down pears with one 's dick . ], 
  meaning : to be lazy and do nothing , or at least nothing of importance . 
  i believe the russians and/or other slavs also have this one . 
  [ i need to stop coming back here and reading the comments because i keep coming up with new ideas all the time ... ], 
  i just thought of * jak z koziej dupy tr\u0105ba / tr\u0105bka . 
  * [ as a trumpet out of goat 's ass . ], 
  it 's used when something is completely incompatible with the indicated characteristics , or of such a poor quality that it 's almost not that at all . 
  * [ it 's such a scientist out of you as a trumpet out of goat 's ass . ], 
  meaning : you 're not a scientist at all [ although you may think you are , or refer to self as such ] or * z niego taki szef jak z koziej dupy tr\u0105ba . 
  * [ it 's such a boss out of him as a trumpet out of goat 's ass ] meaning : even though he technically is/may be a boss he has none of the skills/qualities a good boss should have . 
  / or that he 's not a boss at all and just a liar ... , 
  it 's not misleading because the proper translation marked * `` literally : '' * is right beneath the phrase . 
  then there 's the * meaning * , and this * weird * thing is at the very end labeled : * literally in polish * which is hard to misread when you read all the above before . 
  foremost this :  or when dick is used as an intensifier and it comes out as if a dick was actually a subject in the sentence - most of those are hilarious . 
  because that 's the only reason i gave that example at all , my first and main example was about a circus and monkeys ... 
  man , seriously , stop right there and read again from the beginning and stop embarrassing yourself ... 
  exactly what i wrote . 
  edit : do you really think there are people who do n't know what you just * explained * ? 
  i think i should feel offended or sth ... , 
  that 's an innovation , * right ? 
  i love those * `` as dumb as ... '' * comparisons !, 
  we have quite a few , my favorite is : * ciemny jak tabaka w rogu . 
  * [ as dark as snuff in the horn . ], 
  from the very deffinition of * dark * : lacking brightness ... 
  in the old days snuff-boxes were made out of [ hollow cow horns ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:rozek_kaszubski.jpg ) . 
  since * r\u00f3g * means either * horn * or * corner * and most people today do n't have much idea about using snuff , most of them think it 's : * `` as dark as snuff in the corner '' * . 
  [ i know i did when i was a kid . ], 
  what makes it even funnier since it 's used to tell someone he lacks comprehension ... from the less elegant there are : * wysoki jak brzoza , a g\u0142upi jak koza . 
  * [ as tall as a birch and as dumb as a goat . 
  * [ as tall as a poplar and as dumb as beans ] . 
  the main point here , i think , is that it rhymes ... ps when i read your * `` x meters of rural dirt road . 
  '' * my first thought was our * dno i trzy metry mu\u0142u . 
  * [ the bottom and three meters of mud . ], 
  which loosely means a hopeless case . 
  free interpretation ... 
  we have the same !, 
  * almost ... * in ours horses are plural . 
  * literally : not my circus , not my monkeys . 
  meaning : not my problem ( so ) i do n't care . 
  i was aiming for not vulgar one . 
  there are plenty of vulgar , especially with a dick doing various things ... ** edit : ** or when dick is used as an intensifier and it comes out as if a dick was actually a subject in the sentence - most of those are hilarious . 
  * literally : dick i ( do n't ) care . 
  meaning : i do n't fucking care . 
  literally in polish : dick is walking around me . 
  lmao . 
  the second one 's brilliant !, 
   sort of pop-out like motions . 
  that must 've been hilarious !, 
  :d ... * no * , actually i 'm sure it was rather ridiculous bordering pathetic * lol * but since everyone was drunk and a * krecik * lover ... even weird jumping on a cruise boat is excusable . 
  * yep . 
   `` fucking germans gassed the jews and forgot about it '' from all what he 'd said , from all the examples he 'd given you could clearly see [ but chose not to ] that he 's not antagonistic towards germany , and that * forget about it * simply means that they can/are allowed to * move on * and live their lives here and now and not in the shameful past , because these people have nothing to do with it , so why should they ? 
   i 'll let you know on another little secret , baby : reductio ad hitlerum nice to know you can name what you did by bringing to the table the polish-jewish relationships . 
  thank you . 
  and i 'd be wary to call someone a slow reader when you 're keep handing me arguments that you lack thereof . 
   the katyn massacre lesson was a waste of time i have no doubt that for you it was . 
  that 's the end of this conversation . 
  you 're being repetitive . 
   ** an intensifier . 
  ** period . 
   anti-jewish violence in poland , 1944 -- 46 . 
  sorry , this deflection wo n't work , and that actually proves my point that you have nothing substantive to say . 
  you lack arguments and patronizing tone backfires * big time * . 
   sunshine . 
  get some history books * really ?
