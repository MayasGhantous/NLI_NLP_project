  * that 's all you can dish out ? 
   you back the bulgarian gentlemen . 
  * really ? 
  * where ? 
  reading comprehension problem much ? 
   ( and then you casually and nonchalantly throw an insult at germans , which was really disgusting ) . 
  * disgusting * is how you 're portraying this because * he * actually did n't insult anyone . 
  he just stated facts , gave some examples and expressed his opinion , he did n't value . 
  the only * `` fucking '' * that he used can and * should * be perceived as an intensifier and even if it 's not the case he was talkig about * nazi germany * , having stated beforehand that contemporary germans have nothing to do with it and would feel offended just as he is by that article . 
  [ if i were to choose some words to describe the third reich i 'm fairly sure a * fucking * would be one of the kindest but that has nothing to do with my attitude toward my today 's neighbors , * please * ... ] the patronizing tone of your comment really irked me . 
  now , throw downvotes galore at me . 
  here , i 'll show you something ... we 're gon na do this :  people complain about everything , they 're xenophobe , envy and greedy although we 're still one of the ~ ~ wealthiest ~ ~ countries in the world . 
  while i like many things as they are right now , i 'm very afraid about the future and how right-wing parties and the stupid people who vote them will eventually ruin it . 
  * abracadabra ... * and you have poland or any other country during crisis ... do you feel better now ? 
  :d * no ? 
  * well , i tried ... * also * , you have mozart . 
  that 's a win . 
  * every . 
  time . 
  consolation is that i do n't have a problem with reading comprehension , was n't so sure a moment ago ... , 
  * good * , i agree . 
  i waited for your answer because i started to think that i had to misunderstood something because why would they upvote you and downvote me if that was n't the case . 
  * got ta love reddit . 
  * still , maybe someone would enlighten me , please ? 
  not a karma whore , just honestly curious what 's the mechanism here . 
  what you 're saying is basically that if you do n't care you ca n't be bothered , and to do wrong takes effort same as to do good , and it looks like he 's taking conscious effort to do harm while everyone would just be better off if he did n't give a shit . 
  yes ? 
  i 'm smart enough to know that i 'm not smart enough . 
  and those smart enough are hardly ever attracted to power , which is basically what makes them smart enough . 
  * sigh . 
  * i thought rumcajs was russian ... * i 'll see myself out ... *, 
  well , i read baudouin de courtenay for pleasure and shklovsky ... even bakhtin ... actually after the exam , when it was n't compulsory anymore , i found also structuralism rather interesting . 
  but still , * trauma big * . 
  [ edit : that sounds obscene , does n't it ? ], 
   the prague school , an early structuralist linguistics circle ( jerk ) jesus christ , this !, 
  my very first test at uni - i sat up all night , hung-over like hell , trying to remember all those dates , names and details . 
  * trauma big * . 
  ca n't believe i was actually able to forget that now !, 
  and i remember this fondly , actually . 
  i 'm getting old or what ... , 
  some random babbling , i meant to * tell a story * but * a. . . * * yep . 
  * well , for starters in 966 a.d. they * sold * us this * glorious progressive * idea - get christianity !, 
  * now , quickly * , * yesterday !, 
  * * from us , not from the germans !, 
  * - * 50 % off !, 
  * and now they 're all atheist and we ca n't get a rid of it , still . 
  grand scheme . 
  later they , p\u0159emyslovci , took the opportunity * and * our throne - because , * yeah * , our idiots were too busy fighting one another to notice that place got occupied . 
  adalbert of prague . 
  jan hus . 
  jan \u017delivsk\u00fd . 
  the hussite war . 
  the defenestrations of prague . 
  in the last century we had some * less than favourable joint historical events ... * the prague spring . 
  the velvet revolution . 
  they speak funny - some things never change . 
  * it 's adorable . 
  * :d their ex , slovakia , still loves them , * right ? * . 
  they have * ` osom * coat of arms , we once had identical flags but that did n't work out for them . 
  bohemia and its white lion . 
  and the order of the white lion . 
  our well-liked neighbors on the other side of the sudetes . 
  the visegrad group . 
  they 'd really like to have seaside , they have/had some agreements with poland and germany so they could use our port of szczecin , and germany 's port of * i do n't remember * for their trade * or sth . 
  also , they had lots of leaders named * v\u00e1clav * . 
  milo\u0161 forman . 
  jakub janda , jan matura , jan mazoch . 
  becherovka . 
  tv nova . 
  * til i ca n't spell most of things i know about the czech republic on my own ... ** edit : ** our * very first official leader * , mieszko i , married czech princess dobrava . 
   redundant i 'd say it 's perfect , i mean it 's exactly what i think , but we need someone who speaks czech to confirm , because that 's my question here - is it the same in czech ? 
  we have in polish : * zbyteczny , zb\u0119dny , redundantny * . 
  ** edit : **  redundant = leftover + useless ? 
  but this * useless * is true only in this specific context . 
  something that is redundant in one situation may be not redundant in another , while the absolute meaning of * useless * is that it 's * always * of no use . 
  so something that 's useless is always redundant , but something that 's redundant is not always useless . 
  [ i mean apart from the context , lol . ], 
  [ seriously , right now i do n't know whether i make any sense or not ... ], 
  true but smart voters wo n't help when there 's `` no one '' to vote for . 
  all true . 
   you spent 3000 years slaughtering each other wholesale and now you 're calling other people uncivilized ? 
  please !, 
  we have more in common than we 're willing to admit . 
  we are * `` civilized '' * , americans are * `` free '' * . 
  * yep , * same difference . 
  * sigh *, 
  that one 's interesting !, 
  i 'd say in polish : * bez korzy\u015bci * - unprofitable whatsoever - indeed useless . 
  we also have * niekorzystny * - but here the meaning shifts and that one means * unfavorable * but not necessarily * useless * . 
  that 's the nuance that google translate completely ignores . 
  and that mechanism is actually what makes me wonder if it 's a case between * zbyte\u010dn\u00e9 * and * zbyteczne * . 
  in whatever direction . 
  you know how there are untranslatable puns , poems , metaphors , yeah ? 
  so imagine you have a word that has 5 different meanings in 5 different contexts . 
  now take the so called perfect counterpart for that word from another language , let 's say it covers 4/5 of these meanings in the exact same way . 
  that 's 80 % , that 's really good but it still leaves a great deal of possibilities that will not translate . 
  wo n't make sense . 
  on both sides . 
  unless you have a different tool to * measure * it - another language . 
  i think those two are perfect here : swedish : * `` the limits of my language set the limits for my world .
