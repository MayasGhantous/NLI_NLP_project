  '' * dutch : * `` language is the only country i live in . 
  '' * language limits you . 
  it 's all you know , all you can think , all you can convey . 
  you ca n't go beyond those borders unless you know another one that would cover what does not exist in your first language . 
  apart from common things and words - those universal , * above the cultures * , or identical in some bigger cultural circles , there 're billions of unique things that exist only in our respective , relatively tiny cultures - polish/swedish/italian / et al. 
  all those little things combined make cultures , nations , history - they make us who we are . 
  imagine the world where there 's only one type of bread . 
  everyone 's still allowed to put on the toppings of their choice but the bread is identical in all the cases . 
  and now go tell some american kid to make pb&j sandwich using a pumpernickel . 
  or get a plain wheat bread instead of a croissant with your coffee . 
  it wo n't work . 
  it 'll start crumble , blend . 
  we lose that diversity , we lose things that allow to tell us apart - we lose ourselves . 
  i lol 'd at * brunei * . 
  there 's this movie - * homeless to harvard * . 
  in one of the scenes a teacher hands a girl a book and asks her : * `` what 's this ? 
  '' * , she says : * `` a textbook . 
  '' * , he repeats : * `` a textbook . 
  '' * and asks her to open it and tell him what she sees . 
  she replies : * `` words . 
  '' * he asks : * `` what kind of words ? 
  '' * she answers : * `` the words of the author . 
  '' * then he shows her some other papers/essays and asks : * `` and what 's this ? 
  '' * , there comes a reply : * `` a lot of other people 's words . 
  '' * eventually he asks : * `` why do i want you to have them ? 
  '' * *** `` because one point of view gives you a one-dimensional world . 
  '' *** i think it 's self-explanatory . 
   unnecessary = nepot\u0159ebn\u00e9 = i do n't need it here ( in this context ) we have that too - * niepotrzebne * . 
   zbyte\u010dn\u00e9 = ( being ) leftover ; useless i 'd argue that * leftover * = / = * useless * , not always at least , to cite a dictionary : * remaining as an unused portion or amount * , so where does this * useless * come from ? 
   i do n't want to be mean or something , i 'm just genuinely curious because people tend to do that a lot with polish - use a word as if it only had a single very narrow meaning while in fact there 's more flexibility to it , and if translated without having that in mind it loses a great deal . 
  i 'm a pain in the ass , i know . 
  i have a question , and i 'm kinda wary to ask , because who am i to question a native speaker of a language i do n't speak , but does n't * zbyte\u010dn\u00e9 * , as in polish * zbyteczne * , mean rather * unnecessary * than * useless * ? 
  i asked google and it seems to agree with me , but i 'd rather have an opinion of a human being . 
  :d because if it does it kinda change the point . 
  or am i wrongly convinced that while * useless * & * unnecessary * can be used interchangeably , * useless * has somewhat narrower meaning ? 
  because if something is essentially * useless * it ca n't be used whatsoever , while if only * unnecessary * it still can be of use if the context is right ? 
  do i make any sense at all ? 
   i wish we all just spoke the same language . 
  well , we do . 
   different languages is just one more social barrier . 
  * um * , no , sorry , the world would be a poorer place without polish / and others respective . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  there 's this absolutely awesome quote from stanis\u0142aw bara\u0144czak 's poem - * `` daj\u0119 ci s\u0142owo , \u017ce nie ma mowy . '' * [ * `` i give you my word that there 's no way . 
  '' * ] literally : [ `` i give you [ my ] word that there 's no speech . '' ], 
  i think that those puns are what makes this otherwise truthful but dull sayings even more remarkable . 
  that 's a good one !, 
   to talk in such a way that you can convince people of the sense of your point . 
  yeah , to talk to people so they 'll listen/understand . 
  idiots . 
  with all the consequences . 
  you missed the point . 
  is the general meaning that it 's not words what counts but actions ? 
  your translation is correct just incomplete , i 'd even say it 's the proper way to give people * the feel * since the whole point in this one is that construction * to speak to things * vs * to speak to people * - if we 'd completely skip * talking to things * and just give the metaphorical meaning it 'd lose some of its grace . 
  that 's literal , * m\u00f3wi\u0107 do rzeczy * [ to speak to things ] means to speak reasonably , to make sense . 
  1 ) [ not exactly . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1n3fb9/poland_should_be_merged_with_germany_says_former/ccf4c4b ) 2 ) * wa\u0142\u0119sa , smart , leader * - the only place where you can find these three words together is a dictionary . 
  smart leaders . 
  i did n't think i 'll ever say this but [ there 's rather informative post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1n3fb9/poland_should_be_merged_with_germany_says_former/ccf4c4b ) on r/worldnews and as it appears wa\u0142\u0119sa , who is known for struggling with polish , was indeed misquoted . 
  and while he did not say that poland should merge with germany , what he said is worded so poorly that i ca n't really blame anyone who had a problem with understanding him . 
   it 's only been recently that he 's been saying all this crazy stuff , right ? 
  nope , that 's 100 % wa\u0142\u0119sa from the very beginning . 
  ah , yes . 
  i 've heard it 's good . 
  i 'll have to try it sometimes . 
  nice photo , by the way . 
  ** rather popular : ** [ piast ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/piast_%28piwo%29 ) , [ \u017bubr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbubr_%28beer%29 ) , [ ksi\u0105\u017c ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ksi%c4%85%c5%bc_%28piwo%29 ) , [ harna\u015b ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/harna%c5%9b_%28piwo%29 ) , [ d\u0119bowe mocne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debowe_mocne ) . 
  bear in mind that i 'm a helpless girl who drinks corona , carlsberg , heineken ... the only * patriotic * one being \u017bubr . 
  * shit happens * . 
  so i 'm not really in position to tell which one is the best . 
  but if i may say something for denmark - [ carlsberg elephant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlsberg_group#elephant_beer ) is my absolute hero . 
  * ever . 
  portugal , that 's not fair !, 
  you 're gon na win every competition , you have absolutely awesome language !, 
  *   if this gets any traction , we can move on to the 90 's and 00 's . 
  i just wanted to suggest that !, 
  but what about going back first - '60s , '70s ? 
  i think i might 've gotten a little over-excited in this thread ... terribly sorry . 
  * so much music !, 
  the problem with kaczmarski is that he himself did n't like * the solidarity bard * label and * mury * are generally misunderstood . 
  hence misused . 
  and * the rest of him * is hardly mainstream . 
  i 've been a huge fan of jacek for years now and i had a serious problem with putting him into this compilation - he 's so many so different things and complexity of his works rather calls for separate thread for itself , if you know what i mean . 
  are you familiar with [ this gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbt9po8t4q ) ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22tk6bjaw6g ) with some explanation . 
  ladies and gentlemen - frank sinatra in polish !, 
  ( 1982 ) edit : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ma4v-hxw8 ) and * \u017beby polska ... * are * twins * in my mind . 
   edit # 2 : and while we 're speaking about kaczmarski it 'd be a sin not to mention [ llu\u00eds llach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/llu%c3%ads_llach ) and [ l'estaca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%27estaca ) . 
  * wow !,

  all of these sound so familiar and it 's not even the language !, 
  [ also this !,

  no [ l'italiano ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrdvqt_mt-o ) ? 
  seriously ? 
  that song was insanely popular even over here .

  what about nena ?
