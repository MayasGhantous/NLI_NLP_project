  '' * someone should tell them about the idea of the united europe , * seriously ... *  lars lilholt - kald det k\u00e6rlighed danish songs sound so cheerful in comparison to the polish ones . 
  must be melancholy in our '80s , however the lyrics are pretty hopeful !, 
  also , from what i gained they are rather more pop-ish . 
  i 've read once on wiki that [ * `` poland is one of the few countries in europe where rock and hip hop dominate over pop music '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland#music ) , but i did n't think the difference will be that much noticeable .

  * [ lombard - prze\u017cyj to sam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tlqo90bbl8 ) ( 1982 ) communist censorship took it down almost immediately - it lasted only 2 days , so * naturally * for the past 30 years that 's been one of the most popular polish songs . 
  glorious example .

  thank you !, 
   to be fair , abortion is killing a life to be . 
  that 's pretty much why i personally would n't do that , but that has nothing to do with religion , i think i 'd just regret for the rest of my life that i missed the chance to meet that person my hypothetical child would become . 
  but i 'm pro-choice because of what you said in your previous post - religion is everyone 's private matter and one should n't impose their beliefs on other people . 
  i 'm not a believer and i do n't expect catholics/whoever to act accordingly to my rules , i think everyone should have a right to choose their own way and laws that suit them and live by those . 
  so why they 're trying to impose their laws on me ? 
  it 's a sin , they say . 
  sure . 
  for them . 
  according to their laws . 
  so , why should i care ? 
  and what irks me the most is that hypocrisy - religion becomes just an excuse for everything they do n't like and a mean for everything they want . 
  they choose what suits them and ignore the rest while simultaneously they demand of others to respect all the laws . 
  they call themselves catholic , but premarital sex is ok , and then they say to their atheist/agnostic neighbor that she ca n't have an abortion because it 's a sin , and she 's a disgrace to a catholic country , and they 're personally offended . 
   those numbers should be irrelevant since religion belongs to private sphere of life exactly . 
  because that suggests that people * are * that religious , and in fact it 's just that the church says they are . 
  also , * the hypocrisy !, 
  * * geez , * that drives me crazy . 
  premarital sex ? 
  * contraceptive pills ? 
  * everbody !, 
  * abortion ? 
  *** evil !!!, 
  *** * we 're catholics !, 
  whenever i see a sandwich made of baguette cut horizontally it 's always called * panini * . 
  or some places produce their own brand names for this type of sandwich . 
  also , it 's common that they do n't seem to know that * panini * is plural ... but , * hey * , you can buy * pierogis * which is double plural ... , 
  the law is there because the sejm voted that way . 
  there - they might 've voted that way because of their personal views [ i.e. 
  religion ] or because they thought they represent people 's views , * that would be the first time * ... 
  but we know the estimated numbers of * underground * abortions and * trips * to germany , the czech republic , denmark and so on , and those unmistakably indicate that people do n't care about * the sin * . 
  hence : it 's not religion , unless they think that while abroad god ca n't see ... now , here 's a religious factor : the church gets pissed and shouts that the poles do n't want those * godless * practices because we are a * catholic country * , here 's the flashing of * big numbers * of those who had been baptised , nevermind that the half of them have n't been to church since , and * voila !, 
  * - abortion restricted . 
  on paper at least . 
  and hilarity ensues - we have * `` religious '' * laws in a secular country . 
  ps i 'm a woman , i 'm wholeheartedly pro-choice , but i do n't think i 'd do this , but that 's just me . 
   tl ; dr most abortions are done `` off the chart '' in poland because of religion . 
  because of the law , not religion . 
  he was my age ... that 's humbling . 
  i was gon na say that his parents must be proud that they raised a hero but that 's bullshit , surely they 'd give back all the medals in the world to have their son back . 
   the american soldier who covered a polish soldier with his own body during the recent attack on the ghazni military base is going to receive golden polish army medal .

  well , we actually had some * brilliant * politicians who wanted to ban teletubbies because one of them had a purse but it was a boy ... so they invented this * ingenious * ` transgender propaganda ' and it was blown out of proportions . 
  it was pathetic . 
   they banned donald the duck because he did n't have any pants on .

  i studied french for three years in high school , but most of the time i was solving crosswords under the table [ i really did n't like the teacher ] ... so i 'm actually surprised that i made any sense out of it and not just loose words . 
  okay , so i do n't have the foggiest what this all means , but since you 're the first portuguese i encountered today i want to tell you that your language sounds f * cking amazing to me [ like some wicked hybrid of spanish and russian , and that 's a compliment ! ], 
  and i love to listen to fado just because the language , of course i do n't understand a single word but who cares ... * wait * , i actually understand this : * a primeira est\u00e2ncia do canto um do poema \u00e9pico nacional portugu\u00eas * , * haha * , yay , there 's hope for me !,

  it 's more than one stanza , obviously , but the thing is in every stanza there 's at least one ** word ** that most of you should recognize - in most languages they 're as similar as it gets .

  all that while talking about the need to restrict spending ... 
  * ahh * , there they are - our very own idiots ... * sigh * . 
  it always kind of fascinates me what could be possibly thinking a pole while spraying a swastika on a wall , it 's like a black man shouting * `` white power !,

  so i used to think that those * individuals * just do n't have enough brains to embrace it ... * poor * people but not the kind you could actually feel for .
