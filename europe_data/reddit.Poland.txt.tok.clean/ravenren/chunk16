  * well * , i have a hard time understanding how one can lack a brain to that extent ... or * a heart * for that matter ... but , alas , it 's not like we can forbid them to breed ... anyways , dear redditors , you know we 're not all like that , right ? 
  * right ? 
  i think that even if they tried , the bulgarian people would have something to say about this - even those who 'd be glad to see their government replaced . 
  i , for one , am not a huge fan of * our * government , quite opposite in fact , but if there came some , say , frenchman/swede/whoever and tried to * fix * something for us , i 'd get rather pissed and probably i 'd side with my idiot politicians whom i detest on every other day , and i 'm not even a nationalist , again , quite the opposite . 
  a nice quote for the occasion : * '' ( ... ) they are grateful that the crass idiots in power are , at last , their own crass idiots in power . 
  i made a mistake and asked google for help - found [ this ] ( http://www.polishthestars.com/2010/12/bacon-wrapped-sausages.html ) and now it 's midnight and i 'm hungry ... to say the least . 
  also , not the * polish * i was looking for , but i wo n't complain ... there 's something fierce about bacon with sugar . 
  are you sure it was wrapped in cutlet and not some bacon or sth ? 
   i still do n't know the name , though - that actually baffles me ... first time for everything , i guess . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is [ * zrazy * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zrazy ) but i 'm fairly sure it 's not it - it lacks sausage ... also i 've seen a [ * golonka * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golonka ) wrapped in bacon , but that 's completely different . 
  * awkward moment ensues * - what the heck is the name of this dish ? 
  because i can picture it in my head but i 'm clueless what it 's called ... 
  now i know that it exists !, 
  besides the basics that have already been said : * victoria azarenka - a tennis player * they also consider tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko their national hero * we , along with the russians and ukrainians , have a lot in common when it comes to cuisine, 
  til , thanks !, 
  if i recall correctly , they had some successes on the road to independence in the 1920s but the [ polish-bolshevik war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) got in the process . 
  i ca n't elaborate , though . 
  ** edit : ** and [ i 'm right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarus#brief_independence_.281918-19.29 ) , thanks for the downvote ... 
  true . 
   with bisons in it . 
  * wisent * sounds much more cool ;p,

   once you get past the confusion that arises from the fact that some letters are identical/very similar to the latin letters , but are pronounced differently exactly , though i 've always thought that 's the best part - when i was a kid i felt so smart that i knew that !, 
  if you 're [ interested ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jhkau/there_is_a_city/cbfnnoy ) . 
   [ here 's ] ( http://tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl/informacje,news,miasto-pamieta-godzina-w-w-warszawie,94505.html ) a lot of pictures and some videos from this year . 
  i like your reasoning but i 'm almost * ashamed * i did n't think of it while this is actually the only news worth mentioning this week , so * significant * , and i was babbling about the weather . 
  the heat must 've got to me ... 
  but * the uprising !, 
  * i do n't even ... 
  i wrote a few detailed posts about it , the last one last night , and it 's beyond me how could i forget ... 
  great , now i feel like an idiot ;d and i forgot about the uprising - * unbelievable * - i 've been explaining it to people for ~ ~ two ~ ~ four days and now i forgot ... edit : idek, 
  * ~ ~ too hot to think at day ~ ~ * ~ ~ kind of catastrophic storms at night [ the wall of water was pretty awesome to watch , though ] ~ ~ * ~ ~ temporary flooding as a result , some broken roofs , fallen trees , firefighters were busy ~ ~ * ~ ~ something something about some missing girl that was supposed to be dead but instead was supposedly seen in paris ... ~ ~ ~ ~ i do n't think i read any news last week , did i mention how hot it was ? ~ ~ do n't mind me - i 'm an idiot . 
  i do n't speak russian , nor any other language that uses cyrillic , so to say that i understand the language would be taking it a little too far . 
   if i happen to know the word - meaning , i associate the pronunciation i know with the letters , or if the word is the same/similar to that in polish/has some basic slavic root , then yes . 
  but it usually takes me a moment and a little * active thinking * to comprehend ... basically it 's all because my skills are on the same stage they were when i was seven , even a little bit rustier - i was so dissapointed then that i did n't want to study it anymore ...  then came other languages and i never went back to it - i regret it know , that 's for sure . 
  one weird thing i ca n't explain - i 'd known the alphabet before i knew any spoken russian words but i somehow ca n't connect these two right away , it 's like they 're two separate things for me , thus i need a moment to comprehend . 
  and nowadays i think i 'd quicker understand a spoken sentence than the same in writing , or it 'd be easier to get the meaning from the text after hearing it . 
  i learned how to read cyrillic as a kid , i was seven or so , and i was using it to write sentences in polish . 
  one day i got a can of peaches that had ingredients/best before/whatever listed on it in several languages , and i was trying to read the russian ones ... 
  i could n't quite make it and then my mom came and told me that the alphabet is n't enough , that there 's a whole new language . 
  i was terribly dissapointed !, 
  nationalist are in every country in the world , so are anarchists , and every other * kind * you can think of and none of these groups reflects on the whole country , not even on the majority of its inhabitants , that 's one thing . 
  and the second is : did you miss that little detail that it happend on the ** gay pride parade ** ? 
  homophobic as hell ... 
  he did what every journalist on the planet does - put on an alarming headline that at the same time is vague enough that you have to click on the link if you want to know what this is about . 
  oh , i wrote that * just in case * , you know !, 
   ahead future comments that would inevitably appear later . 
  i was n't talking to anyone in particular since my comment was the first one and it did n't occur to me you 'll take it personally !, 
   getting hit with an egg from your opponents , is the most benign thing that can happen to you . 
  that would be my opponent using their words in a polite manner . 
  throwing anything at anybody for any reason is unacceptable in the civilised world . 
  idiots are everywhere , do n't blame all the lithuanians for them . 
  no , it 's not an official holiday , it 's not a day off , but everybody knows the date , there are the [ official ceremonies ] ( http://www.andrzejczerwinski.pl/uploads/gal/68-rocznica-powstania-warszawskiego.jpg ) , mainly at [ cemeteries ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/gloria_victis.jpg/600px-gloria_victis.jpg ) and [ monuments ] ( http://www.prawoslawnyordynariat.wp.mil.pl/plik/image/news/powstanie_warszawskie/sam_0309.jpg ) . 
  the main ones are held at the [ pow\u0105zki military cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pow%c4%85zki_military_cemetery ) . 
  people remember - [ lay flowers ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/29623/12801217.jpeg ) and [ light candles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/szareszeregicp.jpg ) in other places of historical significance for this event like the [ little insurgent monument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ma%c5%82y_powstaniec ) - a [ photo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:warszawa_powstaniec.png ) - or the [ place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:uprising_baczynski.jpg ) of death of [ krzysztof kamil baczy\u0144ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krzysztof_kamil_baczy%c5%84ski ) - the soldier poet who perished in the fourth day of the uprising . 
  scouts are always very active in these celebrations due to being the successor to the [ grey ranks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szare_szeregi ) .

  and of course there is the minute of * silence * at 5 p.m. sharp - the [ w hour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising#w-hour ) - it 's the time the uprising began - as you can hear in the video it 's hardly silent - sirens , church bells , car horns etc.

  homo homini lupus est & * eee ... * how is kiwi in latin ? 
   he 's just great at being politician . 
  he keeps his party in line , he kept the opposition where he needed it . 
  he controlled the coalition partner to do whatever he wanted and pushed his agenda . 
  this guy is a pro . 
  in that terms - sure . 
  it 's kind of what i said before - * the right man on the wrong side * , but i guess it 's harder to notice since he 's supposed to be on * our * side , if you know what i mean ... 
  in my mind being a * politician * is supposed to equal being a * diplomate * . 
  meaning acting in a diplomatic and tactful way , to have high standards , morals and so on . 
  and in the * real world * being a * good * politician is something downright different , opposite even - you do what needs to be done , no matter the price , and the casualties along the way ... well , i 'm a bit of an idealist . 
  really ? 
  almost every brit i met said it 's strange , 
  i have a rather high opinion of sikorski - and it 's not all about politics . 
  not at all , even . 
  but tusk is lost in my eyes . 
  he got reelected not because he 's so succesful but because there was no any real alternative , and mainly because people were afraid of the far-right . 
  i , for one , voted for the left side but that was rather ideological - economically they all suck the same . 
  it has nothing to do with power , more with the dedication , i 'd say . 
  if merkel lied to the germans as often as tusk lies to us she would n't be the chancellor anymore . 
  and by the way , i think putin is better than they both - in a - * the right man on the wrong side * - kind of way ... 
  it 's not * kind of ugly * , it 's atrocious !, 
  seriously , though , i think merkel is a much better politician than tusk . 
  that 's an understatement . 
  do you have a death wish ? 
  he 'd ruin you and ... you know , you can have him !, 
  :d i 'll add a minister of finance gratis !, 
  i bet they 're doing rather good business on this . 
  probably like the poles who buy russian vodka in kaliningrad oblast and sell on our side . 
  young people go to school , they have history classes , they have polish classes . 
  you can not graduate without that knowledge . 
  so i ca n't imagine how this could be the case . 
  and i 'm still young enough and not from warsaw . 
  quite frankly , i do n't understand how being from warsaw is supposed to be an indicator here . 
  the * `` w '' hour * is observed all over poland , not just in the capitol . 
   wich are often from his family .
