  nothing new here . 
  sadly . 
  the submitter is estonian , so from his point of view they exported ;p, 
  it 's not the points i 'm worried about , i just do n't get how one can downvote something like this . 
   many people in poland do n't know about warsaw uprising . 
  that is not true . 
  that 's the official bullshit . 
  polish get $ 33000 a year ? 
  my ass !, 
  ** edit : ** aah , that 's a * base salary * . 
  well in that case , ok , but it still is a rather misleading article . 
  their * base * salary is , what , one fifth of what they make ? 
  and they do n't pay for things like regular people - they get a refund for fuel , for hotels , for rent in the capitol if they happen to live in another city , for plane tickets , and so on . 
  plus they get a whole bunch of add-ons , bonuses and god knows what else . 
  people smuggle booze , that 's a new one . . 
  man , that was a joke !, 
  seriously ? 
  you 're going to argue who 's flatter ? 
  i 've already won !, 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38lsrbr54u4 ) is better . 
   edit : judging by the number of downvotes maybe you should write some explanation - what 's in the movie and why we do it . 
  most people do n't even know about the [ warsaw uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) ( 1.08.1944 ) - they confuse it with the [ warsaw ghetto uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto_uprising ) ( 19.04.1943 ) , and they do not have the slightest idea why it is so important and why it 's so different from other events of wwii . 
  * `` we 're not totally useless , we can be used as a bad example !, 
  '' * - our new national motto . 
  you 've got krum - awesome enough !, 
  so , you 're saying that your nationalists are almost as intelligent as ours ... ;d, 
   we eat raw meat and horses . 
  and we kiss people three times on the cheeks . 
  same here !, 
  all three . 
  i assure you they find handshakes between people who know each other for years even weirder . 
  and we do that at almost every meeting . 
  especially men . 
  you think they know where poland is ? 
  you 're sweet !, 
  :d i feel relevant !, 
  * aww . . *, 
   i think you might be too logical about this . 
  well , would n't be the first time . 
    i see myself as a european first . 
  you are one of the rare breed , then . 
  most people tend to go * inward * first - silesian  polish  european , welsh  british  european and so on . 
  there was actually a similar discussion a few months ago . 
  some pretty interesting points were made . 
  i was trying to find it , i 'm pretty sure i added it to my bookmarks , but no such luck ...  it 's an emotion/subjective issue that has no definite answer . 
  some people see themselves as ... you asked : * `` does anyone else * *** describe *** * themselves as simply european ? 
  '' * i meant * describe * as * introduce * to others . 
  purely technically - so you 're right i 'm a bit too analytical . 
  and you meant it as * identify * - how we feel about ourselves . 
  now we 're clear . 
   it 's not that popular now , but it 's very widely known and everyone 's grandma can probably make it . 
  exactly !, 
  i think such response only works because the * china * part . 
  i ca n't really imagine a situation in which i introduce myself as a european without mentioning that i 'm polish , and even if , i do n't think i 'd meet someone who would n't ask for further clarification if i did . 
  maybe if i were comparing something , say : * ` it 's like this for you , americans/africans/asians , but for us , europeans , things are different ' * - in that case it makes sense and it 's enough - no further information is needed in such context . 
  also , from my experience we , europeans , are oversensitive on that matter - that we 're not some homogeneous mass . 
  and that 's reasonable and justified - we * are * pretty different from each other , even if we have some common traits when compared with people from other continents . 
  have n't tried * podpiwek * but i love * kwas * . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.lidskij.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kwas1.jpg ) is pretty good . 
   what is exactly `` homosexual propaganda '' ? 
  an imaginary enemy of the far-right freaks ? 
  it 's like an imaginary friend but not quite ... 
  do n't worry , we have idiots too . 
  ours recently tried to criminalize in-vitro fertilization and lock people up for wanting a child * against nature * or god , or hell knows what . 
  then there was a genius who said that raped women should n't have a right to abortion , and next they produced the idea that we should penalize and abolish all abortion no matter what circumstances . 
  but this moron also said that if his wife were raped he would make her keep the child ... so nobody takes him seriously , even other idiots ... and daily behavior of the major right-wing party toward lgbt people is not even worth mentioning . 
  enough to say they do n't even respect another human being , and they constantly insult gay and transgender mps to their faces and they 're not ashamed of it , just the opposite . 
  all that while talking about god 's love , of course . 
  yep . . idiots are everywhere . 
  * nah * , we were just bombed before there was a declaration of war . 
   salt and vinegar chips yes !, 
  do n't know if it counts but i really love a czech chocolate - [ studentsk\u00e1 ] ( http://nestle-catalogue.lion.cz/export-web/exportni_cz_sk/products/images/1/big_orion-studentska-pecet-milk-300g.jpg ) and i 'd be seriously happy if i could buy it in poland . 
  and there 's this polish dessert [ * kisiel * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kissel ) and growing up i was fairly convinced that it 's so common and popular all over the world because it 's so simple and , i do n't know , * obvious * , and then it turned out that there were people who did n't have the faintest idea what the hell i was talking about ... and i was kinda shocked ... 
  i mean , who the hell does not know * kisiel * ... ;d also , up to the age of twenty i * knew * without a doubt that [ potato pancakes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato_pancake ) are genuinely polish dish , then i met a czech who was convinced that it 's originally czech dish , so we checked and it turned out it 's a jewish one - a compromise for us !, 
   and now i 'm hungry . 
  fantastic ... and did you know you ca n't buy ginger ale in poland ? 
  it 's like the third world or something ... 
  you know , when i think of it , while people add and add more things to the list , it turns out that our greatest achievement may be that we still exist , and our language exists , the country , the culture , because otherwise all those listed accomplishments would be in vain ... and it was pretty close a few times , so maybe that 's it - that we 've survived and the rest is just an addition . 
  * poland is not yet lost * and all that ... 
  * yeah * ... and our parliament 's ` main chamber ' - * the sejm * - is also located on * ulica wiejska * [ rural street ] and there are * p **** os\u0142owie *** [ mps , literally - envoys ] almost like * p **** os\u0142y *** [ * os\u0142y * - donkeys ; * os\u0142owie * - kind of humanized donkeys ? ] ... 
   in case you took `` zaliczy\u0107 zgona '' a bit to seriously . 
  pragmatism ftw !, 
  * chamber * suggests a rather grandiose room , like in a palace , while * izba * is something simple , primitive even , like a. . . * chamber in a hut * ... 
  i find it definitely too funny ... ;d, 
  i 've read somewhere that they no longer exist !, 
  that they were too pricy to maintain and now there 's no * izba wytrze\u017awie\u0144 * for you , it 's either jail or hospital if you 're about to die of intoxication . 
  who would have thought ... , 
   a fancy way to say fucked . 
  it also indicates that the result was rather miserable . 
  free interpretation ... , 
  yep , it has such a homely , rustic flavor to it . 
  meaning simple and unpretentious . 
  primeval even ... but on the other hand it also sounds like a suitable name for a mushroom or booze . 
  * ouch * ... 
  i 'm glad to hear that !, 
  [ fun fact . 
  ] ( http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-paris-syndrome.htm ) i sense our chance here ... , 
   it 's nice to see humans working together , once in a while . 
  we should do that more often . 
  [ that 's not even respect , that 's love ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejd2rsxoqsi ) , is n't it ?
