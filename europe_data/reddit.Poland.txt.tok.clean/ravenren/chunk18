  edit : crap , wrong clip !, 
  it was supposed to be [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38lsrbr54u4 ) . 
  thank you !, 
  * yay !, 
  * ~ ~ my favorite time of year ! ~ ~ ca n't wait for all those ~ ~ brilliant ~ ~ articles about how the french have surrendered which was not an honourable thing to do but now paris has an * x million tourists a year * , and how we 've never given up but warsaw was razed to the ground and now our * old town * is 30 years old ... so maybe a little pragmatism over a romantic frenzy would be suitable for the nation ... * oh * , who cares we would be all * sprechen deutsch * right now , right ? 
  exclusively , i mean . 
  and all the parties from whichever side will try to get some points for whatever they 'll try this year . 
  * ahh * , nope , i think i wo n't even touch the tv on the 1st . 
  nevertheless , *** gloria victis !,

  the last time i was in bydgoszcz was in 2003 , so do n't know about that one , but i live in a big city and i am in another one on a regular basis , and no matter how much i love the first one and like the other , they 're not clean , apart from the strict downtown and tourist areas . 
  never said they are . 
  i always have somewhat more * pleasant * idea when it comes to * m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois * ... , 
  i meant the events , not the quality of the books !, 
  evil was rising and gaining power and the whole wizarding world was in trouble and it all started with the escape of peter pettigrew in the third volume , and it was only worse up to the end . 
  go out for a walk and look at your feet . 
  polish streets are not clean , polish cities [ the big ones ] are not clean , look at the walls , all the dirt , all the junk on the ground . 
  and i do n't have a slightest problem with my country . 
  i love where i live very much , i 'm an optimist , but i also know our weak sides and i see where improvements could be done . 
  pretending that it 's all fine and peachy wo n't change a thing . 
  i 've seen enough of the world to know that it 's not bad ... but also enough to realize that it could be much better , and that self-contentedness is never a good thing , it can be * dangerous * in fact . 
  yes , it is the truth - just for the reasons i listed , and the fact that somewhere in the world the situation is worse does n't automatically make us a saint . 
  i 'm well aware of a * driving culture * in the middle-east - or rather the lack thereof - i experienced it , but that does not erase the fact that * most * poles on the road do n't give a shit about other drivers . 
  did i say such a thing ? 
  read carefully !, 
  i said that ** those who left the country to work in rural areas ** are mostly underachievers . 
  and that 's a fact . 
  if someone left for a big city because they wanted to [ meaning could afford it ] , or to work in their line of education in another country/city , in better enviroment , or just because they wanted to improve their skills and that 's where they have the opportunities - they 're not those i 'm talking about . 
  if someone left for the rural area and got a house there , a farm , whatever , because they felt like it , they 're also not those i 'm talking about . 
  and that kind of people do not cause road accidents under the influence while they are going to work in a cram-full van . 
  it was great !, 
  but that 's also the part where everything started to go south ... 
  any chances you remember the title ? 
  there 's a supposedly great [ book on the subject ] ( http://www.amazon.com/freedom-climbers-bernadette-mcdonald/dp/1926855604 ) but i have n't read it yet ... , 
  [ almost ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1c2zc6/never_again/c9d6vht ), 
  * neutrality means that you do n't really care * * cause the struggle goes on even when you 're not there * * blind and unaware * rise against - * collapse ( post-amerika ) * , 
  your username makes me uncomfortable ... 
  and the latest wimbledon . 
  * the [ commission of national education ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commission_of_national_education ) created in 1773 is considered the first ministry of education in history . 
  * we were the first country in the world to abolished [ corporal punishments in school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_corporal_punishment ) in 1783 . 
  * also , what may seems * funny * given our current situation , poland is the only country in the world where homosexuality was [ never ** illegal ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_poland ) . 
  * and as [ u/bigos already mentioned ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jc5me/what_isare_your_countrys_proudest_moments_in/cbd7nwy ) there is [ the constitution of may 3 , 1791 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) . 
  * i 'd also say : the significant religious tolerance when the rest of europe was involved in all kind of religious wars , but we all know what happend next , so ... yep . 
  do n't know if it counts for the ` proudest moment ( s ) in history ' , but it 's a pretty good list of achievements , i guess ? 
  ** edit : ** * and we managed to [ get a rid of * the red ones * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1989 ) without bloodshed . 
  how awesome is that ? 
   ** edit # 2 : ** * ca n't believe i forgot the [ first winter ascents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eight-thousander#list_of_eight-thousanders ) of the eight-thousanders !, 
  ten out of fourteen and two to go . . , 
   i 'd go with may 3rd constitution . 
  a bright flash of sanity , humanitarianism and rejuvenation of polish land . 
  pity it got killed before it could really improve things . 
  second that !, 
  well , we have : * nieszcz\u0119\u015bcia chodz\u0105 parami * [ calamities come in pairs ] . 
  so maybe that 's it , or there will be four ... it 's like * misery loves company * ... 
  i really hope it wo n't be a trilogy . 
  kamikaze !, 
  kind of . 
   on a side note , what 's the name of the salt mines outside krakow ? 
  it 's been bugging me for a while now . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wieliczka_salt_mine ), 
  do n't be paranoid , 5 euro is about 20pln , still cheap . 
   very clean , which surprised me the most . 
  almost no trash on the streets ... you sure you were in poland ? 
  * wow . 
  * and here i thought i 've seen it all ... 
  a few months ago some journalist estimated that the prime minister in his limo made the distance between two cities too quickly - had they driven accordingly to the signs it would take them at least two hours more ... 
  i really should n't have laughed at this ... ;d, 
  some 12 years ago , when ma\u0142ysz was on top , a teacher asked my class about a pole who 's so famous that people on every continent have heard of him . 
  there was silence , and then after a while me shouting [ in the * eureka * style ] - * adam ma\u0142ysz !, 
  * :d i was so proud i came up with this ... but , well , she meant * the * pope ... 
  let me put it this way : who leaves their own country to work phisically in rural area of another country ? 
  generally either a ) the less-educated or b ) those who could n't get it together in their own country for whatever reason , mostly a ) and b ) combined . 
  add some alcohol , and excessive drinking is tied with not so good living situation in most cases , and you 've got that outcome . 
   given the history of the last , oh say 80 years or so ... more like 800 ... oh , and for the record , it 's not the people we do n't like , it 's their politics and politicians , but for that matter we do n't like our own as well , so . . take a pole and a russian , give them a bottle of vodka , and in half an hour , they 'll be babbling about slavic brotherhood . . come to think of it , they also could be in the middle of a fight , because they could n't find a compromise whose vodka is better ...  the two countries used to be part of the same kingdom ? 
  [ you can say that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ), 
  poor tanks :(, 
  all true , but the baptism 's date is widely considered the beginning , though mainly symbolic , and i think for people not familiar with our history it 's a good start . 
  too many details would n't do any good . 
  that 's not a stereotype , that 's the truth !, 
  edit : and it 's not necessarily the lack of skills , it 's rather a kind of arrogance on the road . 
  many think they 're * the king of the road * , and act as if they were , and as we know , there may be only one king ... 
   the name poland comes from the word pole which means field . 
  to be exact - it comes from the name of the tribe - * polanie * [ the people of the fields ] . 
  their leader united all the tribes and became the first polish duke in 966 [ the baptism of poland ] . 
  his son became the first king and the history of the kingdom of poland has begun . 
  home !, 
  i read : * anti-dump **** l **** ing * ... that would n't be very smart , 
  well , poland would get drunk and then cried all his sorrows to the world , or rather anybody who 'd listen , and then they would try to cheer him up that it 's not all bad , and that he had his moments ... and then he 'd drink even more and then started boasting that he 's glorious and invincible , and then he 'd drink again and probably collapsed somewhere while drooling in his sleep . 
  edit : and he 'd sing in russian and swore in german and caused some international drama , and the next morning he 'd say that it 's all fault of russian vodka , and germany was being mean . 
  well , thank you . 
  i was rather * pissed * when i wrote that . 
  i 've never said , that we were a saint , but you chose * really * wrong example here . 
  the second republic was expansionist , but that was understandable that after the partitions they wanted to take back what was taken from them . 
  they were also rather nationalistic , but again , after 123 years of russification and germanisation what exactly would you expect . 
  [ i hope you noticed i have n't said a word about the wars in the 17th century , when the commonwealth occupied moscow - that was a good example , and everybody fought back then , back and forth . ], 
  also , you ca n't deny that the result of the war of 1919-1921 prevented spreading of the international revolution that the bolsheviks planned . 
  so , if we 're talking about the lesser evil , that would be it . 
  but i 'm not saying that war was something good or praiseworthy . 
  war is always wrong .
