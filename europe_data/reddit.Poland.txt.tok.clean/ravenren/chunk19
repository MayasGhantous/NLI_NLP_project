  it 's nothing personal , i just treated you like an embodiment of russia for narrative purposes , and i was really pissed , so i 'm sorry . 
   the last few days ithout rain also helped . 
  that 's good . 
  i 'm hoping for the same , but swollen rivers are gon na be a problem . 
  for me , portuguese sounds like a mix of russian and spanish - i speak neither , so that 's just an impression . 
  i really like it , though . 
  my thoughts exactly , 
  [ click and listen ] ( http://translate.google.com/#pl/en/konstantynopolita%c5%84czykiewicz%c3%b3wna ) - that 's the second word , google has some trouble with the first one ...  . 
  and about consonants : ko ** nst ** a ** nt ** ynopolita ** \u0144 ** czykiewi ** cz ** \u00f3wna ** nst ** - you have that in english [ constant , constitution , construction , constable ] ** nt ** - that too [ ant , enter , constant ] ** cz ** - it 's one sound ; like *** ch **** ocolate * ** \u0144 ** is soft - it 's ** ni ** but shorter ; like french * polo **** gn **** e * ** y ** - in polish it 's always a vowel ; like ** i ** in * b **** i **** tch * almost every second phoneme is a vowel . 
  and the division into syllables : kon-stan-ty-no-po-li-ta\u0144-czy-kie-wi-cz\u00f3w-na . 
  and now it looks pretty easy . 
  polish in general - sure . 
  in this case - not really . 
  it 's always moving north . 
  if the czechs have flood , sure thing it comes to us too . 
  it 's not worth it , he clearly has an agenda , so i would n't count on any rational arguments to get through . 
  so those are almost equal parts for poland . 
  i know it looks shitty in comparison to the rest of europe but i was seriously worried it 'd be much worse . 
  i 've never seen any act of * active * intolerance [ i mean violence , not derogatory talking ] , and people i know are in the vast majority perfectly ok with it , but what you can see on the internet forums is really disturbing sometimes . 
  or rather most of the time . 
  and there are haunted far-right politicians who do n't even respect another human being ... 
  but it looks like there 's hope after all . 
  good . 
  true , but vienna was still pretty awesome . 
  but yours is kinda better . 
   but with the eu calling a halt to the testing of healthy cattle at abattoirs , the need for the word vanished . 
  * phew * . 
  i already thought that the word consisted of too many characters and was against some brilliant eu law i did n't know about ... 
  and here i thought that they liked us . . , 
   things were a bit less black-and-white in this conflict . 
  after 123 years of occupation and terror that * ended * in 1918 you 'd have at least a little decency and stayed quiet . 
  ** edit : **  in fact , the entire history of the second polish republic is quite ... interesting ** you 've got to be kidding me ** ... that 's the most hypocritical thing i 've ever heard . 
  here comes the bully and points the finger at the victim and says they hit him back !, 
  russia attacked us , had been destroying the country for thirty years before finaly erased it completely , has occupied it for one hundred and twenty three years , razing , grabbing and killing in the process , over and over , and here you come and have the guts to even mention the second polish republic . 
  unbelievable . 
  ** the republic that would n't be the second , had n't you destroyed the first one !, 
  ** and then you destroyed this one too , and you 've occupied it for another fifty years !, 
  had it been twenty years earlier i 'd say : change the textbook , because your soviet one is biased . 
  and you 're the first russian i 've ever encountered to say such a stupid thing . 
   by the centennial of the siege of vienna , poland was being partitioned . 
  i find it quite ironic that austria was one of the invaders , while the ottoman empire was the only country that found the partitions invalid . 
  one would think it should be the other way around . 
  that 's heartwarming . 
   new york city is not the capital of new york state - it 's albany . 
  holy shit !, 
  we have a word for it : * solidarity * . 
  i want them in europe . 
  well , yes , that 's basically what i meant - the media just make it observable - they 're loud and often take an astonished tone as if what happens is unheard of , 
  and the media are surprised every year !, 
  the next time they 'll be surprised is when snow falls in december ... * just like every year . 
  relax , i was looking for poland and realized my mistake only when i did n't find it ... 
  eurozone , not european union . 
  there 's an [ interesting map ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1f10oi/percentage_of_people_who_consider_themselves/ ) on the subject in general , but unfortunately estonia is omitted . 
  [ there it is . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/09/06/why-estonia-has-started-teaching-its-first-graders-to-code/ ), 
  you do n't even understand what this is about . 
  you 're a hopeless case . 
  what makes you think that people 's ignorance is suitable measurement of something being significant ? 
  you as a citizen of a country that is so often underestimated should know that . 
  * really * . 
  i 've read an article which stated that they made it obligatory for school children to learn programming languages . 
  they 're the first in europe to do that . 
  if they pass out at 8pm , they probably started drinking the day before , so it 's still a pretty good result . 
  are you ignorant or just mean ? 
  every time you say something like this you end up downvoted . 
  seriously , man , does n't it tell you anything ? 
  it hurts me to see polish flag next to your name ... 
  information without context is worthless . 
  period . 
  the biggest issue this thesis is about are the bystanders . 
  you do realize that poland was the only country where when caught helping the jews one was punished by death on the spot along with his entire family and others who happend to live with them in the same house . 
  who they were was irrelevant . 
  they would have got killed as well . 
  i think this alone explains * the bystander issue * . 
  if i were significantly outnumbered , unarmed , surrounded by the enemy , and under a threat that my actions have a power to hurt not only myself but also the people closest to me , i would think twice before i 'd move a finger . 
  initially i thought it 's a * unicorn * and was like * wtf * ... 
  if you left , they would get a little better . 
  well , we have to agree to disagree . 
    there are problems in the meat industry but that we know about them just shows the checks work you 're right . 
  what scares me is that some dealings had been taking place for so long before they were outed . 
  in other words you trust the system . 
  the system that is proven to be flawed on more than one occasion . 
  the eu regulations are n't some `` by god imposed unbreakable holy laws '' - they 're executed and supervised by people . 
  i think i stick with trusting a single man . 
  too many people in the system to trust them all . 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries but in poland we had a few scandals with meat in the main role even before the one with the horses , so i might be a little paranoid . 
  still , better safe than sorry . 
  and of course there are some proven brands i trust but at the end of the day it 's a mass production and all the things that come with it . 
  my local supermarket - in theory not the best brand as supermarkets go - has incredible rolls - delicious crust , not puffy . 
  better than the ones from an actual bakery that 's just across the street from my home . 
  every morning and every afternoon there 's fresh delivery . 
  people do n't want to believe when i tell them where i buy it . 
  but the same chain 's supermarket in the other part of the city has different supplier and their bread sucks big time . 
  sure i do n't know how the animal was fed but everything what comes next is me trusting - the butcher i buy from does everything by himself . 
  buying animal , killing it , preparing meat , smoking , processing , whatever . 
  it 's a tiny family business , father and son , they 've been in it for years . 
  they care for a client . 
  they have the same clientele for years . 
  people are standing in line for their meat . 
  animals they buy are healthy and checked - he ensures because if something goes wrong his business is going to suffer .
