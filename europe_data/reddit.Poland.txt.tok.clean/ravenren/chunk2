  the polish flag is pinned by the wrong side ... white should be next to the mast . 
  it 's * sad * 'cause i bet it was a pole who hung it . 
  our is pinned by the lower side and the others by the upper . 
  was it too hard to just look at the others ... seriously wtf . 
  ** edit : ** either that or polandball can into reality ... 
  nah , i like my theory better . 
  and germany 's high number comes from a lot of work put into building it ... that makes sense . 
  work for work . 
  it 's almost like * l'art pour l'art * . 
  almost . 
   you sound like a russian nationalist . 
  is that a new way to say that someone sounds like an idiot ? 
  we could lose the * russian * part . 
  nationalists overall are n't the sharpest tools in the shed . 
  calling people * russian nationalists * just for the sake of it is even dumber . 
  * [ if ] you can count , count on yourself . 
  ukraine ca n't catch a break either . 
  it 's probably a gruesome thing to say right now but if you 're right i hope their deaths wo n't be in vain ... 
  let me cite [ * the xenophobe 's guide to the poles * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/xenophobes-guide-poles-ewa-lipniacka/dp/1906042446 ) . 
  [ clears throat ] * the quintessential polish dilemma is that two opposing views can be held simultaneously in one and the same polish breast . 
  * lalalala * ca n't hear you !, 
  * lalalalala * polan can into space !, 
  * lalalala * suck it up * la la. . . *, 
  me too . 
  true . 
  but that does n't change a thing . 
  * sezon og\u00f3rkowy * = silly season , 
  inferiority complex . 
  checked . 
  [ a collective boner ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jch9b/so_today_the_results_of_what_do_you_know_about/ ) . 
   this sort of stuff : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqt2ph5-yo awesome !, 
  they all look so peaceful and contented . 
  is there somewhere an english translation of this song ? 
   a czech mother with four children got lost in the mountains . 
  the children were 3 , 7 , 10 and 19-years-old . 
  she was found by the police and handed over to unspecified czech officers . 
  rmf24 to say that they got lost * in the mountains * is a little stretch . 
  and that was basically two adults and ~ ~ two ~ ~ three kids . 
  they just got on the wrong path and ended up in a different town on the way down . 
  called the cops coz they did n't know where they were . 
  sound move , i 'd say . 
  although it would probably be easier to just ask someone on the street ... 
  i would n't call that woman a * dumbass * . 
  the idiot who fell on the slovak side [ lol ! ], 
  is out of her league , for example ...  edit : numbers are * hard * , duh . 
  it 's a common figure of speech that does not sound racist in polish . 
  people use it all the time and generally it does n't even occure to them that for some it may sound racist . 
  from my experience , when i use it i do n't even really think about black people , it 's just a thing to say that has its own meaning in the language , pretty much an idiom . 
  we have a few of those that would be crucified in other countries for being racist . 
  but here they 're neutral . 
  unless used by a racist , but then the phrase is not the main problem ... 
  i think being almost * all white * country has a lot to do with this . 
  in other countries such things were present but then the times have changed and people got a rid of them , here the times have changed but there are no [ not many , at least ] people that could be offended by those sayings so they are still hanging around . 
  of course it 's not the most politically correct phrase there is but that 's about it . 
  our foreign minister caught on tape in recent eavesdropping scandal used one of them in private conversation . 
  we had a national * oh , wow , that does not sound good in english * moment . 
  here 's an interesting [ post on the subject ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/28sd2g/polish_foreign_minister_caught_on_tape_saying/cie1p6c ) . 
  it 's a dialect spoken by the [ * g\u00f3rale * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorals ) [ highlanders ] in the tatra mountains region of [ * podhale * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podhale ) . 
  * podhale * means * under the mountain meadows . 
  * even their instruments have * accent * , especially violin . 
  they also [ hold ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwc6btadgi ) it in their special way . 
  they [ speak ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqvaff8ppmu ) ^ 1 funny , they play funny , they [ sing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwsub7yvopw ) funny , their [ dance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntrngq0sz4c ) is fun , and they have pretty awesome [ clothes ] ( http://www.folklor-lalki.pl/foto/medium/para30_podh_440px_125_2544.jpg ) . 
  fun all around . 
  their accent , style in music and clothing are so distinctive that most poles would recognize it , probably even the most ignorant ones . 
  ^ 1 i ca n't find a good recording of them speaking . 
  the one i linked to is from * pasterka w \u017babnicy * . 
  [ * pasterka * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pasterka ) is a traditional midnight mass between christmas eve and christmas day , and a village * \u017babnica * , as wiki told me , is in [ * beskid \u017bywiecki * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbywiec_beskids ) . 
  the thing is that region has its own * g\u00f3rale * who have their own way of speaking . 
  i do n't know how much it differs from the one from podhale , but to my ignorant ear it sounds similar . 
  sooo ... 
   the brits realised the germans were trying to play a schubert tune with the rhythms of machine gun fire ; naturally a brit officer who was fond of schubert took control of a british machine gun and began playing the song in unison with the germans . 
  this is awesome and heartbreaking simultaneously . 
  it 's similar to when you think about us being only in the background of someone else 's life . 
  here 's your world , you 're in the very center . 
  you think , you feel , you experience . 
  everyone else is just a supplement to you . 
  some crucial , some expendable , but every one comes through your perception . 
  and then there 's the realization that you may be that dispensable add-on for someone else as they have a life of their own where they 're the most important thing . 
  that really puts things into perspective . 
  it 's no rocket science and we all know that , but when you stop and think about it ... 
  i 've seen somewhere on reddit someone put it into much nicer words . 
  kinda regret i did n't save that ...  and old people , two things : 1 ) old couples after decades together still holding hands while walking , and acting like when things were all new and fascinating . 
  i envy , in a good way , every time i see that . 
  2 ) place : some military parade , lots of veterans , here comes the banner . 
  scene : teenagers sit on the curb unmoved , playing with their phones . 
  a man 80 + in a wheelchair , military cap on his white hair , decorations pinned on his chest , is trying to get up to salute properly ... kids still on their iphones ... 
  i 've seen this on pictures , i 've seen this in real life , and i still do n't get it how they do n't get it ... wtf . 
  edit : can not into letters . 
   but everyone involved , even the worst of them , were still people . 
  this is exactly what i meant when i said i 'm fascinated by such things . 
  * wrong * refers solely to the word * aww * incorporated into * auschwitz * . 
  it ca n't be ad hominem as it is related to subject , not some irrelevant add on , that 's for starters . 
  and i 'm afraid i unintentionally produced one more `` essay '' for you to read . 
  seriously sorry . 
  first things first :  if your answer boils down to `` you 're wrong , i see no racism and discrimination of the elderly and you 're stoopid '' then spare me the answer , please . 
  this conversation is not about racism or the elderly in poland , it 's about an add about faulty buses and safe travelling . 
  ** you do n't know that . 
  reddit users are not the target group for this . 
  they lack a context and experience in the subject . 
  ** this adress is so simple it 's honestly ridiculous that you say it 's not memorable .
