  so he has a personal interest in everything being top-notch . 
  any supermarket does not do that . 
  they do n't care - they have nothing to lose . 
  i do n't mean solely poland , i mean everywhere . 
  the horse meat scandal - is n't it enough ? 
  besides , butchers usually have fresh stuff and delicious . 
  got ta love natural selection . 
  do not buy meat in a supermarket . 
  ever . 
  you do n't know what 's inside ... a local butcher is your friend . 
  people , * seriously * !, 
  that was supposed to ** spirit ** new zealand ** up ** !, 
  you 're not helping !, 
  the hell i know we 've got nice landscapes too . 
  * geez . 
  sure it is , among many others . 
  damn new zealand and your beautiful nature , 
  you ruined my joke !, 
  i was hoping nobody would notice . 
   females like whores as well ? 
  it depends on the whore . 
   no whores in the vincinity though . 
  i feel for ya . 
   besides weed , whores and windmills . 
  clogs and tulips . 
  sure , we know that . 
  we 've got our fair share of those , too . 
  i just hope that they 're not the majority . 
  this is weird what i 'm about to say but i 'm kinda glad that this is happening because if france can overcome them and still be a country friendly to all of its people then maybe there 's hope for us , after all . 
  actually , i usually do n't do that , but i really liked what you said and i had nothing wise to add and just upvoting you did n't seem enough , so there it is . 
  have an upvote !, 
  it has nothing to do with religion per se but a feeling of being discriminated , or somehow excluded because of the religion , might get frustration going up . 
  even if it 's not the case - all it takes is a feeling . 
  under normal circumstances it would n't do any difference but in already difficult socio-economic situation it may be a factor even if it 's not the main cause . 
  i think that * too grey * is actually literal - clothes , hats , interiors , maybe rites if pushing for a metaphor but i definitely was n't considering music when i wrote that !, 
   i love bach very much , maybe not as much as mozart , but still . 
  what 's interesting is that my favorite by bach is the mass in b minor which is actually the only latin mass that he wrote - common for lutheran and roman tradition . 
  also the most famous mozart 's requiem in d minor is , * um * , beyond boundaries , because it 's suitable for both those religions , and mozart was a catholic , well , * mostly * . 
  that 's the wishful thinking that we share . 
   i 'm not saying all poles are like that , mate . 
  i 'm talking about poland as an entity , regarding its institutions , the same way i do about spain and its fascist ones that still remain today . 
  for instance , i freaked out when i learned abortion was illegal there . 
  i mean , come on !, 
  oh , yes , i actually talk about it [ a few posts higher ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ezkq1/poland_a_dark_side_of_the_catholic_church/ca5nobg ) . 
   although the majority of them called themselves catholics . 
  atheism is somewhat rare there . 
  therefore , in the same way , people freaked out when i told them i had n't been baptized . 
  i would call myself a catholic because i was baptised and did n't officially perform an act of apostasy , and foremost because that 's the tradition that 's the closest to me . 
  i celebrate christmas , i sing carols , i celebrate easter , if someone wanted me to pray for them - it would be a catholic prayer , because that 's what i know . 
  ** but ** i would call myself an agnostic because that 's what i believe , i would n't get married in church , i do n't go to church . 
  and i think that this is why pure atheism is rare , but still not as much as you think . 
  people here have a hard time dividing religion from tradition . 
  for centuries being polish was being catholic - the time of foreign occupations - the germans were prostestant , the russians were orthodox - catholicism is something what had us united since 18th century till the fall of communism . 
  you ca n't get a rid of it that quickly . 
  but it still happens really fast . 
  as for the freaking out because of baptism - i ca n't help you here - my own brother has n't had his children baptised and i never gave it another thought . 
   it 's very true what they say about poland a and poland b. 
  yes , there is that . 
  it 's also true for youngsters/elderly , cities/countryside , higher education/lack thereof - but this trend is present everywhere . 
  that 's a given . 
  omg , please , do not perceive a nation of forty million by a small group of literal fanatics - i 'm talking about the fuss around the wooden cross in front of the presidential palace . 
  sure , there is fundamentalism , as everywhere , but it 's marginal , as in most places . 
  i 'm fairly sure you can find even more of those in the us , yet nobody says about the states that they 're fundamentalist , or orthodox , or whatever . 
   utterly ridiculous they were , were n't they ? 
  yeah , exactly , that 's also what the majority of poles think . 
  that 's the heart of the problem . 
  and also the reason why * church the institution * is trying to get a say in everything . 
  first example - poland - a secular country where the church has too much to say . 
  there were times in history , not so long ago , when people needed the church to support them , when the church was a sort of asylum , but now it 's not and it seems they do n't want to accept the fact that power is not theirs anymore , that they have to back down to their original position and coexist . 
  instead , they 're trying to force everyone into their vision of the world . 
  and the worst are the hypocrites who shout loudest . 
   but there is one area where the catholic church really shines : fashion and hats !, 
  oh , yes . 
  also , stained glass , ornaments and singing . 
  especially singing . 
  i may not be religious but i love sacred music - a pipe organ , a choir . 
  i have a nice quote for the occasion : * `` it 's the pageantry , pomp and circumstance of roman catholicism that appeal most to the poles . 
  protestantism never stood a chance - much too grey . 
  '' * it 's from `` the xenophobe 's guide to the poles '' - it 's a great read , by the way . 
  the whole series is awesome , every book about different nation . 
  sure , they ** institutionalized ** everything . 
  it 's exactly what i 'm saying - the institution . 
  they do n't care for your afterlife , they care for their payment for the funeral . 
  they 're a disgrace to * the church * as it 's meant to be . 
  at least i hope it was meant to be something good . 
  but , * hey * , i 'm not a believer , what do i know ? 
  edit : they promise you eternal life and then if your descendants do n't pay for the grave they 'll dig you up and bury someone else on your place . 
  there was such case in poland two years ago , some small town priest wanted to remove a grave from his local cemetery because the family did n't want to pay . 
  you have to pay for maintenance of a grave every 20 years , or so i 'm told . 
  had a good laugh first thing in the morning . 
  thank you , prince philip !, 
  he strikes me as the kind of a person who is rather hard to dislike . 
  he 's more funny than offensive , and his position makes him even more so . 
  i think there should be a distinction between * the church * - an institution , and * the church * - the believers . 
  i have a lot of respect , admiration even , for the people who have faith [ mainly because i do n't ] but i have none , bordering on contempt , for that institution . 
  also it never stops to astonish me how various non polish media still think poland is 100 % religious/catholic and they talk about * improvement * when it shows 98 % . 
  they count everyone who was baptised [ including me and my family - none of us goes to church ; the last time i went was when the pope died and that 's because i was still in school back then and was given a choice - the church or a chemistry class with other group if i do n't want to go to the church , go figure ] as catholic and religious observant , when in reality only 40 % of those who described themselves as catholic goes to church . 
  let 's say 90 % was baptised . 
  half of them is attending masses . 
  that 's less than a half of the whole nation .
