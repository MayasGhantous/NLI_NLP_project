  have a nice day !, 
  oh , man , you can not into fun ... , 
  is that a challenge ? 
  what if someone knew where it was much earlier but chose to keep quiet because otherwise our * big brother from the east * would just put his hands on everything ? 
  i mean right after the war . 
  not to mention you could * get disappeared * in the process ... and then people die , facts get forgotten , shit happens ... and if someone really tried for the train not to be found ? 
  that would explain a lot ... because , you know , i 'm a romantic and i hope this thing exists and is awesome ... ca n't help . 
  and i 'm in lower silesia so i 'd just drive down there in a heartbeat to see ...  edit : and as an afterthought , imagine you found a treasure in a war ravaged country . 
  some people are still fighting till the early 50s , some are still in the woods . 
  people who fought for poland are being executed as traitors by the new * proper * government . 
  everyone is poor , hungry , scared , and you found a freaking train full of a nazi loot . 
  what do you do ? 
  i remember the august of 2006 here . 
  the first seven days it rained nonstop day and night . 
  it 's the only time i 've seen something like that . 
  the next two weeks or so it was only mostly wet . 
  and then for the last week of the month it rained again almost all day everyday . 
  i keep dreaming about something like that now ... or just imagining gloriously wet november ... weird things happen ... maybe next year you will dream of that refreshingly wet july of 2015 ? 
  who knows ? 
   different interpretations of people from cultures different than mine . 
  that 's definitely the best part of this sub for me too . 
   i appreciate when people take some time to think . 
  i 'm not sure about thinking but i definitely took my time talking ... 
  wow . 
  thank you . 
  you made me smile first thing in the morning , 
  i did n't even know what his views are , and after reading the article i still do n't . 
  they still do n't , they just assume ... 
  i do n't really care about most artists ' personal views . 
  ( the guy i listen to the most was a wife-beating alcoholic and a terrific lyricist at that . 
  i 'm just trying not to think about it ... ) this guy here makes pleasant music , i found him accidentally on spotify , liked what i heard , end of story . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are such people in spain who would just like to hear the music . 
  why everything has to be brought to politics ? 
  and if he starts preaching from the stage ( hypothetically , because i think that 's the only case his views would matter ) then maybe we should just let the people judge him ? 
  maybe someone will throw a tomato or an egg ... or just leave . 
  delete him from their ipod . 
  whatever . 
  fine him if he breaks any laws . 
  but banning the concert altogether ? 
  on the other hand , i wonder what would happen in poland in a similar case , given that we had morons protesting madonna 's concert , or more recently conchita wurst . 
  he 's scheduled to concert in poland sometime at the end of the month , i have n't heard about any prostest yet ... yet . 
  btw . 
  dostoyevsky hated poles with a fierce passion and they still made me read him in high school . 
  and i liked it . 
  who cares what the artist thinks about unrelated things if their art is good ? 
  i get that the views can be incorporated into the art but one can always just ignore such piece of art ... 
  i do n't know , i probably just do n't like when people try to tell other people what they shoud do or think ... and in this case the organisers tried to tell the artist what he should * do and think * , not to mention the festival goers ... who probably have views as varied as it gets and wo n't give a s # ! & ... 
  just invest in eastern poland already . 
  poor nordics . 
  only socks there ... 
  i know . 
  36 \u00b0 c in the shade here , lower silesia . 
  but there in full sun things probably got even hotter . 
  stay strong . 
  and just yesterday i read here a comment of a spaniard about the brits in socks and sandals roaming spain . 
  i have a feeling we might not be as special as we like to think ... 
  not even once . 
  my fan and i greet you from the other side of the country . 
  was n't biedro\u0144 named as the best mp or sth ? 
  or was that fake too ? 
  holy crap !, 
  warsaw * can * look handsome after all . 
  edit : i watched it three times , it 's prettier than i expected . 
  kinda * d'aww . 
  in polish * kim * means * whom * . 
  * z kim ? 
  * - with whom ? 
  so if someone asks : * o kim kardashian ? 
  * they may mean : * about kardashian who ? 
  * it 's early enough so i think that 's funny ... 
  sure i am . 
  we 're still here !, 
  a bro does n't have to be a sibling . 
  here be dragons ... 
  i * aww 'd * audibly ... 
  bros are always cool !, 
  poland 's is henryk siemiradzki - [ the sword dance ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/taniec_w%c5%9br%c3%b3d_miecz%c3%b3w ), 
  he did n't mix it , he just used a direct calque from polish which sounds as the opposite in english ; should be just : * duty before pleasure * . 
  edit : oh , wait . 
  he * did * . 
  i looked at the wrong part . 
  no , it 's not . 
  look at germany 's names in different languages . 
  some come from names for just a part of the country , and not always the same part . 
  finnish * saksa * or french * allemagne * . 
  would you also say these languages are * wrong * ? 
  and we call them * niemcy * . 
  saying that a language is wrong is really * weird * ... how can a language be wrong if it 's true in it ? 
  in polish the country is called * holandia * . 
  people hearing * holandia * think about the whole country , not just a part . 
  we could call it * flower * and it would be as much right . 
  it 's just a name in this language . 
  period . 
  and btw , we have also * kr\u00f3lestwo niderland\u00f3w * ( the netherlands ' kingdom ) but it virtually does n't exist apart from some official texts/businesses . 
  it would be understood but no one would use it instead of * holandia * in a regular talk . 
  it would sound pretentious . 
  in polish you are . 
  we call you all just * holandia * . 
  there 's * p\u00f3ki * in all the matches of the last fivb world championships . 
  i did n't catch any anthem in this year 's world league ( i 've seen all the games , though ) , but it 's a safe bet nothing has changed .
