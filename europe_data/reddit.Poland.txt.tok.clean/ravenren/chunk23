   and it 's harder to hear mistakes . 
  unless the majority knows the wrong words , then you ca n't hear the proper ones ... every time poles sing the anthem you can clearly hear * `` p\u00d3ki my \u017cyjemy '' * instead of the proper * `` kiedy my \u017cyjemy '' * . 
  primo : [ siegess\u00e4ule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_victory_column ) . 
   polish army troops , fighting alongside their soviet allies , hoisted the polish flag on the column on may 2 , 1945 at the end of the battle in berlin . 
  poland 's official flag day is held each year on may 2 , in commemoration of the event . 
  secundo :  the date was chosen to coincide with the polonia day traditionally observed by the polish diaspora outside poland and the polish senate on may 2 . 
  there was also a historical reason : under the communist regime , may 2 was a day when national flags , hoisted for labor day on may 1 were being quickly removed before polish constitution day ( may 3 ) , which was banned by the authorities . 
  since the re-introduction of the constitution day in 1990 and establishment of the polish flag day , the flag is flown continuously during the first three days of may . 
   * and poland said , ` whosoever will come to me shall be free and equal for i am freedom . ' but the kings , when they heard it , were frightened in their hearts , and they crucified the polish nation and laid it in its grave , crying out `` we have slain and buried freedom . '', 
  but they cried out foolishly ... for the polish nation did not die . 
  its body lieth in the grave ; but its spirit has descended into the abyss , that is , into the private lives of people who suffer slavery in their own country ... for on the third day , the soul shall return to the body ; and the nation shall arise and free all the peoples of europe from slavery . 
  * murica , do you even freedom ? 
  and it 's kinda funny when you think about [ it ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1989 ) next stop : space . 
   and does anyone really care about volleyball ? 
  [ hello . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2iz1r5/poland_2_0_germany/cl6ufjx ), 
  you mean like graffiti on the walls ? 
  sure , together with * 666 * or crosses upside down in a * `` catholic '' country * . 
  we have our fair share of anti-semites but those swastikas it 's just football hooligans and their idiocy ... in krak\u00f3w it 's cracovia vs. wis\u0142a . 
  so swastikas are presumably against cracovia . 
  or , you know , just some idiot with a spray ... the real anti-semites are probably those who you would n't even think of . 
  the vocal , shouting , spraying things are just imbeciles . 
   do n't they like jews and see them as fellow victims of nazi germany ? 
  as a kid i used to think so . 
  like it was the most obvious thing in the world . 
  and then , quoting lem : * `` i had n't known there were so many idiots in the world until i started using the internet . 
   nazis sadly have to come from somewhere well , they did n't come from poland ... 
  as i said : * idiots * - the most vocal . 
  * `` normal '' people * - just sigh ( do n't comment at all ) . 
  i like to think that for every moron on the internet there 's someone smart , not prejudiced , well ... * normal * , who just knows better than to argue with an idiot , and that 's why there 's much less resonable comments . 
  people just realize arguing with idiots is pointless and just steals your time and peace of mind . 
  it 's not like you can change them over the internet . 
  better to do something productive . 
  it always helps to remember that idiots are the most vocal ones . 
  normal people just * sigh * at such comment and proceed with their lives . 
  as i just did . 
  or at least i keep convincing myself so . 
  welcome to the internet . 
  i decided it was high time to finally read some agatha christie since i already had the whole collection sitting on a shelf . 
  i started with * the body in the library * and found out i 'm not a miss marple fan , also did n't manage to guess who killed . 
  then there was * ten little niggers * and yay for me !, 
  i guessed correctly who the killer was . 
  next was * crooked house * , i had the right idea from the very beginning and then gave up on it and chose somebody else because i 'd came to a conclusion that my first choice was too ridiculous ; well , it was n't . 
  i 'm still pissed about that one and that 's my favourite book so far . 
  * hercule poirot 's christmas * - i was so excited to finally * meet * poirot i had no clue who killed , nothing , not the faintest idea . 
  * the murder of roger ackroyd * - a favourite on par with * crooked house * . 
  and i did n't make the same mistake twice , i stuck to my type and i was right , although it was so obvious towards the end ... and now i 'm reading * murder on the orient express * , i 'm not far enough to even take a wild guess * who * , but i noticed that it might 've happend earlier than they think so this should be fun . 
  also noticed that poirot says things that he for sure already knows are wrong , the old bastard !, 
  i knew he would n't tell everything he knows , but i foolishly thought all he says is true . 
  well , not this time !, 
  i noticed that too !, 
  i have too much fun with these books . 
  only regret that i 'm reading christie in polish but when i started collecting fifteen years ago i was a kid in primary school with insufficient english skills ... 
  i also read some short stories in between , * the witness for the prosecution * was best so far . 
  as those are very popular books , no spoiler , please , be human . 
  * thank you . 
   that is even more fascinating that the bible itself and i 've spend countless of hours watching lectures on youtube about it . 
  i can see myself doing just that . 
   i 'm reading the bible from cover to cover . 
  for general knowledge 's sake i 've been planning to do that for a few years now but there 's always something more * interesting * ... one day . 
   question 47 of 47 | score : 141 out of 141 that 's correct . 
  quiz over . 
  you scored 141 out of 141 . 
  your score is 100 % . 
  well , that was way too easy ... 
  i thought it would be about * knowing them * , not about knowing where they sit . 
  swap poland with czechia and germany with italy and it 'd be easy to mark . 
   also there was no plates in gdynia starting with e. did you miss that little detail that it 's all black with yellow numbers ? 
  these are temporary plates . 
  that 's a temporary plate , for sure polish ; pn-s-73200 is a norm that regulates shape of plates in poland . 
  and the coat of arms looks like gdynia , as was already stated . 
  yes , it is annoying and kind of ungrateful * but * if i were the family of that mother & child , i 'm pretty sure it would feel like a miracle . 
  so many things could have gone wrong , where doctors would have been unable to help , but they did n't . 
  people like `` miracles '' happen to them , it gives hope . 
  i would n't bash the use of the word altogether . 
  just a thought . 
  our defence minister already needs a tin foil hat so whatever ... but on the other hand , russia is hardly a saint , you know . 
  * they all * could just stop playing the dick measuring contest . 
  jeez , guys , you really ca n't into that humor thing , * huh * ? 
  did you know that the polish word for rape is a german loanword ? 
  wrong direction , mate !, 
  * looks at the flair . 
  tell that to the soviets !, 
   `` third times a charm '' that 's already happened . 
  they tried to make everyone hate them twice and now they 're the most liked and with the ` strongest ' passports ... life 's a bitch like that . 
  ... but for how long ? 
  middle-earth . 
  fits in so many ways . 
  i know , right ? 
  op , i 'm sure guys over in / r/bikeporn / would love the shit out of it . 
  go and reap your karma !, 
  but the question is : do they have enough broomsticks ? 
  hey , we have [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vang_stave_church ) of those too !, 
  imported straight from norway ... 
  the second bucket sealed the deal . 
  i might have * aww * 'd ... 
  * ah * , ca n't have everything , i guess . 
  my list of films to check out is getting so long these days . 
  added . 
  is it [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_consolations_of_the_forest ) ?
