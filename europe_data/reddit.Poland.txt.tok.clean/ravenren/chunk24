  you 've got me intrigued . 
  oh yeah , these guys make me smile frequently too . 
  i 've seen them live and when they 've got into the polish repertoire the audience got elated . 
  they used to concert here like every other year , but last year some morons started protesting because * hurr durr * russians !, 
  i do n't know what came out of this , though . 
  and while folk metal does nothing for me , the breton interpretation strikes every chord . 
  my love for denez prigent might have something to do with it , * hah * . 
  it 's not an article . 
  elaborate !, 
   never about their governement though . 
  i think i can do [ something ] ( https://youtu.be/qi2skrk8sns?t=109 ) about it ... 
  i 'd think that an old lady who got to the other side of the road does not care much for your motives as long as you were polite about it . 
  she 's just happy she made it . 
  i think it 's a bit like when people say that a charity provided by * a random celebrity * does not count because they 'd done it for publicity . 
  and even if , so what ? 
  people in need got help , that 's all that matters . 
  or at least that 's what i think . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ typos, 
   polish death camps ... 
   shame someone like that is called a `` professor '' he should team up with paw\u0142owicz and leave for mars or something ... 
  i would * sooo * love to have it but i 'm afraid it would eat me in my sleep , would n't take * no * for an answer , and the amount of food that goes in * and out * ... so i settled for a dachshund & scottish terrier mix which looks like [ this ] ( http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/d/doxiescot.htm ) . 
  short paws , mean little creature . 
  does n't take * no * for an answer but i 'm bigger , so there 's that . 
  love her to death , * eh . 
  and you all forgot about the [ most popular one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_tatra_sheepdog ) . 
  also , the [ other one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_hunting_dog ) with country 's name . 
  that 's funny but in most families i know it 's the mother/wife who reigns and has an obedient husband . 
  it 's the case within my family as well . 
  my mother always had the last word . 
  my grandma , well , no one sane ever even try to oppose her , not even her colonel husband . 
  the other grandma was in charge as well . 
  i have married brothers and those asses say it 's convenient for them ... so , those mighty slavs might say one thing and then rapidly change the answer if their wives happen to come into the hearing distance ... 
  * you should see my mother instructing my father who he should vote for , or what is appropriate to say in public . 
  he thought once his gay jokes were funny ... and then my mom heard it . 
  * lol . 
  * i 'm a girl , i can fix my sink , * thankyouverymuch . 
  that project of the lithuanian flag with the nordic cross looks dope . 
  and now i really hope there 's a country where they call it a cinnamon roll ... , 
  these are not alternative meanings , they 're just words we use to describe that particular sign . 
  its names , if you will . 
  this sign . 
  is called period , right ? 
  but you do n't think of a dot as if it had all the actual meanings that the word * period * carries . 
  it 's the same with @ . 
  we call it * ma\u0142pa * [ monkey ] in polish but that 's just the name of the sign . 
  no one looking at an animal would think about this sign @ . 
  and you do n't really think about monkeys while writing @ either . 
  it 's just a word . 
  oh , the bath thing is very real . 
  just remember that water should n't reach too high 'cause the experience of hunting for an alive and kicking carp on the bathroom floor is not something you want to , well , * experience * ... and after you 're finished with the ritual murder remember to save some carp scales , dry it nicely and give one to each family member . 
  they should put it in their wallets , supposedly it works charms on your money levels next year . 
  i was never brave enough to check what happens if you do n't ... if you forgot about the scales beforehand , try the ceiling , the walls , and all immediate environment , there should be plenty ; probably till easter . 
  cheers !, 
  i got a rod once . 
  it was silver and sparkling , and had a big red bow . 
  i put it on the christmas tree . 
  i thought it was fantastic !, 
  although , my grandma , joke 's on her , looked disappointed ... my cousin broke my rod because the one he 's got was n't silver ; i cried . 
  grandma looked baffled . 
  what 's your part of poland ? 
  amen . 
  honestly , i 'd take any fish over turkey . 
  i love fish and carp , properly prepared , is just delicious . 
  let me tell you a story , it 's a good one . 
  a long time ago , back in 2010 , someone up there in mighty television thought it was a great idea to skip annual re-runs that christmas ... when people found out there wo n't be * home alone * , nor its sequel , on tv , there was outrage ( * they ruined christmas !, 
  how dare they ?!, 
  * ) , followed by protests ( * bring back kevin !, 
  we want christmas !, 
  there 's no christmas without kevin ! * ) . 
  some tried to reason with the people , but to no avail . 
  the might had to crumble , and then there was kevin , back just in time for christmas , and saved the day . 
  no one tried to take kevin from us ever since . 
  all was fine . 
  i kid you not . 
  i had kevin stashed on dvd at that point , but i protested nonetheless . 
  because how dared they ? 
  it 's the third year in a row , i kinda miss snow , but not really , but i do ... did murica take all of our winter again ? 
  [ here ] ( http://europeisnotdead.com/disco/expressions-of-europe/european-nationality-related-idioms/poland-nationality-related-idioms/ ) you go , ours are neutral !, 
  you think we should tell murica ? 
  about the moon , i mean . 
  the whole * first-man-there * thing ... * hmm * . 
  there 's the full text of the book in english , hanging in plain sight . 
  i actually found it accidentaly , i searched for * `` mein kampf poland '' * , trying to find if the book is banned here or not , and if it will be published or not . 
  but instead of using * `` polska '' * i somehow stayed in * the english mode * , which happens often after reddit , and there was the link on the first site . 
  i think archive.org is somewhat like project gutenberg , meaning legal , but now that i think about it , i 'm not so sure how that works . 
  i ca n't summarize anything else as i did n't read it . 
  and after seeing the sheer volume i 'm somewhat less enthusiastic ... 
   the german ban was based on the fact that the copyright holder ( the state ) did n't print it and as they had monopoly , nobody did . 
  i would think that the polish ban would be based on the german copyright . 
  in 2009 there was a case where someone published it in poland without the consent of the bavarian government and that was the reason they cited why it was illegal , but this morning i read some articles from 2011 and 2014 stating that the book itself is banned in poland , which would make it still illegal to publish and circulate any secondhand copies , no matter the copyrights . 
  and as one of my sources was a wiki page and the other some guy in some interview , i do n't really trust them , but i ca n't find anything else in the net . 
   but perhaps you have an actual law ? 
  seems like a small thing to legislate over ( particularly when the copyright holder is of like minds ) , but who knows . 
  exactly , i 'd think when germany allows it ( and it was n't really banned there ) , there 's no point in keeping it banned here . 
  in this day and age , d'oh . 
  but what i read now somehow seems harsher than a few years ago , which does n't make much sense . 
  and i 'm clueless . 
  oh , man , when i said * i 'd be glad if someone could enlighten me what 's the legal situation with * *** this one *** * in poland * , i meant that i think the book is * banned because of the very contents * . 
  or was at some point . 
  that wiki page said , if i remember correctly , that you can own a copy but if you 'd like to sell it , you ca n't .
