  or a pole not polish enough ? 
  ( because they 're the only * true * ones ) does not matter , really . 
  edit : spelling 's hard at 2 am . 
  do n't want muslim immigrants ? 
  burn an effigy of a jew !, 
  logic stronk !, 
  that 's really all that needs to be said about those people . 
  ashamed to say they did it in my hometown where there even exists , what we call , the * borough of four temples * , where a roman catholic church , an orthodox church , a protestant church and a synagogue stand next to each other . 
  and the city is generally perceived as tolerant and accepting of other cultures due to its past ( was a part of four different countries and their various incarnations at one point or another ) and a fairly young population - it 's a university city , every fifth inhabitant is a university student and as such is supposed to be educated , tolerant and unbiased ... and there 's tons of erasmus students . 
  * sigh . 
  as long as there 's love , happiness and mutual respect they 'll be ok . when people say this is * wrong * i ca n't understand what they do n't understand . 
  perfect , thank you . 
  oh , well , no wonder the physical map did n't enlighten me , i guess my brain went on for a weekend already ... 
  i figured the carpathians but i wonder why it 's such a clear cut on the opposite side , why not to go all the way to the sea ? 
  the danube is clear when i 'm actually looking at the map right now but the north-eastern part of the banana is still a mystery . 
  is there a river or a valley or something ? 
  what i am not seeing ? 
  what 's going on with this banana west of the black sea ? 
  a shitstorm in europe that does not involve us ? 
  god bless !,

  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e2hydifdiu&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=131 ) you go . 
   blame germans for dragging trees in the house . 
  i 'm stealing that phrase . 
  wings . 
   4 years of nutjob right-wing rule will probably teach the nation a thing or two . 
  we always have to do things the hard way , do n't we ? 
  he managed to bring up smole\u0144sk not ten minutes in . 
  i think that 's a record . 
  well , frankly , polish law is of no use in ireland , probably no matter the branch , no ? 
   yeah , he was really something . 
  too bad they did n't manage to get into sejm they had a potential but they squandered that . 
  turned out to be a joke , and unfunny one at that . 
  and what do you mean they did n't manage ? 
  last time they did . 
   zjednoczona is too much old fat commies for me , do n't you agree ? 
  well , i voted for them today , it 'd seem they 're the only ones from the left side with any chances to get through . 
  i always cast my vote for the left , even if just as a counterbalance . 
  it 's not like any of them have an actual chance right now , and i 'd rather have miller & co. than no left at all . 
  i do n't really like those commie allusions , today they 're just the average lefties . 
  and po pissed me off so much , i 'd rather vote for pis if i had to choose between the two , honestly ... ( edit : ok , maybe not really , but i 'm so fed up with po ... 
  i did n't , nice does not sound right . 
  i voted for palikot the last time ... 
  oh , i thought i 'd be a nice calaisdoscope ... 
  i wonder what the czechs think , sounds praguematic . 
  that cannes not be true !, 
  united left here , i 'm helpless . 
  i 'd just like any * left * in the parliament ... 
  and the funniest thing is i have mostly no idea/interest what my neighbours are up to . 
  i know that the guy upstairs is n't gay but that 's because i can hear * her * every other day ... give it a few more weeks i 'll be able to tell when she 's faking it . 
  and that church going lady who keeps bringing me her excellent cakes , i 'm sure she does n't realize i 'm an sld-voting agnostic who would n't exactly back out of same-sex experimenting . 
  and her purebreed likes my mongrel , * huh * . 
  i know one of them listens to radio maryja because i can faintly hear it in the bathroom late at night ... but that ca n't be the cake lady 'cause she 's on the other side of the corridor ... the guy upstairs is hosting a party right now , i 'd rather not know that . 
  there 's singing , if i 'm lucky they 'll be out like a light before midnight . 
  there was just a loud * thud * and now there 's silence . 
  * the little things ... * that 's two people out of 6-9 i 'd count as immediate neighbours . 
  no idea about the rest . 
  although , i 'd say the married with children are no gay either , but who knows ? 
  maybe i should ask if their kids are from in vitro ? 
  * hmm ... *, 
  exactly . 
  that 's nice !, 
  with all that white and red it 'd feel like home . 
  were they looking for wally or something ? 
   in the us , half voted against trump . 
  in poland and other european countries , he would get 90 % yeah , that 's just bullshit . 
  thank you . 
  a year ago we voted scaremongering populists that will make poland great again in power ... it was supposed to be the middle finger to the establishment and the corrupted party that 's been in power for 8 years , turned out to bite us in the collective ass . 
  also , all kinds of morons now think they have mandate of the people to do as they please . 
  turnout to the ballots was 50 % , and 50 % of that voted them in . 
  cheers !, 
  god bless america ... 
  you gorgeous bastards !, 
  it 's all wet asphalt in wroc\u0142aw ... 
  i 'm jealous . 
  and remember it 's st. martin 's today - [ rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/croissant_de_saint-martin ) wo n't eat itself !, 
  second that !, 
  you know , i used to think that we 've got some bonus amounts of * special * people here . 
  and for some reason the more * special * , the more they want power . 
  so watching our politicians of various options speaking their minds i was often thinking : `` in a * normal * country * this * would be unacceptable , * that * would never happen , and * they * would be done and out '' . 
  i was mortified when we elected our current government a year ago , and in the first week they proved to be even worse than people had predicted . 
  but then it seems somehow the world all over went crazy ... and i do n't even know anymore where that * normal country * would be ... but then again , i feel somehow * better ( ? 
  ) * or maybe we 're not that special , or maybe we 're all mad ... you remember that time when a polish politician demanded spain to pay down a loan from the xv century ? 
  in gold ? 
  * yeah * , good times !, 
  eesti , you 're sexy . 
   five percent income tax . 
  five percent income tax . 
  i ca n't stop repeating . 
  what do i do now ? 
   do n't try to invade uk and sweden and are happy to live in poland . 
  invading polan 's fashionable again !, 
  yay !, 
  is it so hard to actually try to understand what i wrote ? 
  really ? 
  if you 're looking for a fight you 're not gon na find one here . 
  that timing though ... just when polish [ artists protest ] ( http://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/wiadomosci/kraj/nie-oddamy-wam-kultury.-protest-artystow-przed-pkin-00029700 ) the government trying to tell us what is and what is n't art , what should be * allowed * , and what is * worthy * ...  wajda 's last film powidoki ( afterimage ) tells the life story of the avant-garde painter wladyslaw strzeminski , who suffered under the post-war stalinist government in poland . 
  the director said he wanted to ** `` warn against state intervention in art '' ** . 
  the film was recently chosen as poland 's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 oscars . 
  [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37603756?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central ) i 'm not one for sticking politics everywhere , but the situation just makes itself , if you know what i 'm trying to say .
