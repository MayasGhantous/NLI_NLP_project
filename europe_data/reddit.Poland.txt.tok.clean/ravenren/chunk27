  i 'm not sad that he 's gone . 
  i 'm grateful that * he was * . 
  90 is a beautiful age , and he was * on it * right till the end . 
  as wicked as it is , i think his passing right now will speak that much louder for the cause he 's believed in and that he 's worked for all of his artistic life . 
  poles are volatile creatures , sentimental , romantic and prone to getting overly emotional for the sake of it . 
  the reason will always present itself . 
  and when the reason stands just there glaring and sparkling , that 's when we made the world 's headlines . 
  the nation watching wajda en masse when the govt tries to mess with history/art/law and , * umm * , * muhfreeeedom * ( sorry , murica ) ? 
  that 's so sweet i could almost feel for them . 
  wajda was one to give a piece of his mind to whomever he disagreed with . 
  loud , clear and obvious . 
  there was no need to ask him , if he had something to say , he said it . 
  and it 's no secret that he was n't a fan of the * `` true poles '' * in power right now . 
  god have mercy !, 
  ^ ^ see , ^ ^ i ^ ^ just ^ ^ got ^ ^ into ^ ^ this ^ ^ whole ^ ^ * big * ^ ^ * drama * , ^ ^ * get * ^ ^ * your * ^ ^ * gears !, 
  * ^ ^ mood . 
  ^ ^ 100 % ^ ^ polish , ^ ^ i ^ ^ swear !, 
  ps just to make it clear ... 
  i hope no one will use him in a political shitstorm , on whichever side . 
  i got a little carried away at the end of my comment there , * huh * ... but all i 'm for is * art is art * with all of its obligations and consequences and it should never be , well , censored . 
  there . 
  have a nice day . 
  see that , folks ? 
  if you need a house built , hire the poles . 
   despite german attempts to mine it in 1944 44 ? 
  that 's probably 'cause they 'd reached some limit for destroying stuff in warsaw earlier that year . 
  it 's what we call * hidden german option * . 
  apparently , it 's half of the country . 
  * which half * is dependent on whom you ask . 
  courtesy of our politicians . 
  we do ?!, 
  i 've never seen anyone putting ketchup on a pizza ... 
  i thought we 're better than that !, 
  but then again i 'm guilty when it comes to garlic sauce , so there 's that . 
  and pineapple ... when i was a kid pineapple and garlic sauce together was my favourite thing . 
  i f #cking * love * pineapple on a pizza ... * my god * , i 'm no better . 
  nah , sweden , we 're good !, 
  you have ikea meatballs and we have pierogi . 
  both world famous !, 
  ;d and while i personally would rather spend the winter in sweden instead of italy , that preference does not count for much either way . 
  but i can tell you one foolproof reason i 'd rather not live in italy permanently : the possibility of an earthquake scares the living shit out of me . 
  it 's the thing i 've always loved about poland - so dull and unimaginative when it comes to natural disasters - the worst we get is a flood . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/why_didn't_you_invest_in_eastern_poland%3f ) . 
  it was so ridiculous , it actually became successful . 
  mostly as a meme , though . 
  but as we know - * real life do n't real ! * . 
  when you count * the internets * , it 's probably one of the best marketing actions ever . 
  now , invest in eastern poland !, 
  why have n't you yet ?!, 
  edit : oh , i 'm late to the party . 
  should 've probably refreshed before replying ... 
  ** poland ** * the ** world youth days ** happened in krak\u00f3w . 
  started on tuesday , ended today , the ** pope ** came on wednesday and is on his way home right now . 
  no one died , a baby girl was born during one of the masses ( she 's got * franciszka * for her middle name after the pope ) . 
  apparently , the biggest problem is the trash the pilgrims left behind . 
  i 'd say we did good . 
  * amidst the above , the ** president ** managed to sign yet another bill that has to do with the *** constitutional *** *** circus *** . 
  it seems it just fuels * the circus * further . 
  i do n't even care to know anymore . 
  * our holier-than-thou ** government ** * of course * knows * better * what the ** pope ** meant by what he said about helping the ** refugees ** . 
  nothing will change . 
  ( and as i am positively paranoid terrorist-wise , i do n't know if i care anymore about that one either . 
  * sigh . 
  * ) * all in all . 
  we managed to survive another week . 
  * yay !, 
  the so-called `` twin '' ( two-families house ) . 
  one part belongs to someone with money , the other to someone without money . 
  worst is when both sides have money and no taste . 
  btw , i like the bush and colours on the derelict side better . 
  the modern look on the new one killed the mood . 
  and is that pig alive ? 
  it was n't supposed to be tears of joy , dammit !, 
  i 'm holding you responsible ... :(, 
  you forgot 2016 , june 30th , when we made ronaldo cry . 
  got ta love the irish . 
  they were great the last time too !, 
  it 's like we 're watching something big and bad beginning in slow motion . 
  i still hope someone will take a step back or something . 
  is this like all the other big bad things started in history ? 
  one day things just were n't as they used to be ? 
  he was n't using it anyway ... 
  as the saying goes : * jak daj\u0105 , to bierz . 
  * - if they give , then take . 
  if they do n't give , then take and run . 
  26/28 \\ o / defeated by hungarian tulips and slovenian eels . 
  and , to be honest , the finnish swan was a lucky guess ... 
   while the other outcome is marginally better for 51 % of the population and catastrophic for 49 % . 
  hey , that 's our last presidential elections !, 
  or austria 's ... my point being , that 's democracy for you . 
  you did n't get the joke , did you ? 
  you do n't say ... [ looks west ] while switzerland is just ensuring its neutrality !, 
  it seems like a sound idea , you know ? 
  i thought we 're the most defenceless creatures in the continent , and then i spotted you !, 
  it 's so nice to have company !, 
  i know quite a few people who own a gun , they all are hunters or cops , though . 
  i do n't even know if i 'm surprised because we have such a low number , or because the rest have so much higher . 
  crypto-muricans all over the place , * hmph * . 
  oh , hi there , romania !, 
  * ah * , i have incriminating pictures from when i was twelve .
