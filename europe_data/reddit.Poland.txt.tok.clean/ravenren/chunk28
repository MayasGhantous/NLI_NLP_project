  but since i 'm a girl and it was a one-piece bathing suit with a large circular cutout on the back , i looked more like japan ... 
   i was that guy with bad sense of humour , but after all i felt bad for these sad creatures without any sense . 
  amen . 
   concentration camp sorta funny you 're better than the previous guy . 
  i like you !, 
   depressive yet still funny i believe that at the very end , all we have left is laughter . 
  ( it was n't supposed to sound so somber ... 
  i had a useless bit of trivia , that we call * fun * fact here ( or off top , * heh * ) , for the frenchman , so i think it 's only fair to have one for a neighbour too !, 
  once in high school we were supposed to read [ borowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_borowski ) 's [ short stories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/this_way_for_the_gas,_ladies_and_gentlemen ) about the * life * in camps . 
  i got picked to share my opinion with the class . 
  i was eager to , because i rather , * um * , ` like ' the subject . 
  i kinda like to talk too ( ca n't you tell ? ), 
  so it was going rather smoothly . 
  i talked longish and she did n't tell me to shut up yet , which was unusual . 
  crucial fact : the teacher and i really did n't get along . 
  to illustrate it : she was annoyed when i * did * my homework . 
  well , that time , i did . 
  so i would n't shut up , but she kept asking ... what the hell ? 
  it went on for a few more minutes . 
  she looked pissed . 
  but i had all the answers !, 
  and then it hit me . 
  she was trying to find something i have n't got covered . 
  it was so ridiculous that i laughed . 
  out loud . 
  in the middle of my rave on the cases of cannibalism in the camps and double morality . 
  human condition at its finest . 
  that was supposed to be funny . 
  it 's not . 
  * huh * . 
  for real . 
  if you have any interest in the subject but have n't read * this way for the gas , ladies and gentlemen * yet , i reccomend . 
  it 's fascinating and fantastic , and utterly horrible at the same time . 
  it will suck life out of you , and you 'll be glad about it . 
   great sense of humor  a very fun read after reading about four suspicious corpses and a bomb ... you , the french , may be more my kind of people than i had previously thought ^ ^ 1 . 
  that 's , * um * , morbidly pleasant . 
  thank you . 
  and i really wanted to visit paris !, 
  but i 'm scared of explosives in public transport ... * hahh * ... [ tears of despair ] ^ ^ 1 i lied , i 've loved you since ever . 
  for example , i 'm a fan of charles aznavour !, 
  so much that for the last few months , like every second morning , while opening my news , i 've been expecting to find out that his age had finally caught up with him ... 
  i 'm dead serious . 
  i realised that after a few times it happend . 
  i do n't think that 's * normal * , but then , what is ? 
  cheers !, 
  ** poland ** * ** 25 y.o. 
  died at a precinct ** ; there were riots in front of said precinct for a couple of days . 
  from the looks of it neither he was innocent , nor the police were in accordance with the law . 
  * some moron made ** a bomb ** and [ left ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/wroclaw-bomba-w-autobusie-film-z-monitoringu,645850.html ) it ** in a bus ** ; the driver carried it outside ( i have no words ... ) , put it on the ground , and then it went * boom * . 
  one person got mildly hurt because the bomb was as retarded as said moron . 
  now other morons say in tv what the bomb-moron did wrong - why the bomb was [ faulty ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/wroclaw/bomba-we-wroclawiu-podobna-do-tej-z-zamachow-w-bostonie/0z2z97 ) . 
  at this point they could just send him a tutorial for all i care ... ( that 's my city . 
  and my bus . 
  i. hate . 
  * some people think the bomb and the dead guy are connected . 
  * i do n't know anything else 'cause the bomb made me read local news for the first time in years , and i found there a milion ways to die in my neighbourhood , besides the bomb ( fire !, 
  car crashes !, 
  run over by a tram !, 
  ) , and now i 've lost all will to know anything else . 
  * oh , wait , i know one more thing . 
  they are looking for some ** missing girl ** . 
  they think she 's dead but it seems they 're not sure . 
  they were looking ** in a river ** for the body . 
  they found . 
  ** three bodies ** . 
  in about a week . 
  no , none of them is the missing girl . 
  without palms and feet . 
  in two sacs . 
  floating . 
  * i do n't think i will ever leave home again . 
  chopin 's father was french , yes . 
  and as much polish as curie was french . 
  meaning , not really . 
  citizenship by marriage in both cases . 
  so , chopin was half-french indeed , but curie would be a stretch . 
  but her kids born an raised in france were more french than polish , even though their mother was polish and spoke to them in polish . 
  as i see it : chopin with one french parent , born and raised in poland - polish . 
  curie 's kids with one polish parent , born and raised in france - french . 
  so , * um * ... anyone hungry ? 
  bratwurst left , kie\u0142basa right , pickled herring to the north . 
  welcome , do n't touch anything and play nice , kids !, 
  chopin was french . 
  curie too . 
  dear britain , we 're terribly sorry our nation produced that ... * thing * . 
  if you 'd be kind enough to accept our heartfelt apology . 
  here 's an idea for the betterment of us all : when he 's done with those 12 years , just run him over with a bus . 
  twice , just to be sure . 
  yours sincerely , poland ps . 
  as an afterthought , just do it right away . 
  problems start when they expect you to be a hard worker ... 
  that 's how you know you 've met an actual pole !, 
  tell them they 're looking good and it 's nice to see them , and they proceed with a novel length revelation why you 're wrong 'cause they could n't possibly look more awful today and give you a list of all the people you 'd be more fortunate to be meeting with than with them . 
  i loved them !, 
  8 years old me was gangsta all right . 
  that was mid '90s ... 
  ca n't tell whether it 's a fine german humour or the usual mere matter-of-factness ... 
  do n't worry , we took your * chips * and slapped a * y * at the end to make it double plural . 
  want some * chipsy * ? 
  and while you 're at it call that new dish * paella * , then you 'll have 3in1 !,
