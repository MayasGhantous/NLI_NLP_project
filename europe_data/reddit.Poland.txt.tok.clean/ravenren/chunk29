  i dig the ducks . 
  we can breathe here . 
  * lower * chances of respiratory system diseases , * duh * . 
  no worries , in the near future donald j. trump will make us all wish dubya was back ... 
  we 're not silesia . 
  we 're lower silesia . 
   san domierz this is golden . 
  hahaha ;d your whole exchange is funnier than it should be . 
  props . 
  this one is beautiful . 
   ravaavavaraavaavaravaaravaraaravaraani that is majestic . 
  and confusing 's good !, 
  something in that photo makes me like it more than justified . 
  so like a * softer * version !, 
  * aww * :3 i just came back from / r/aww , i find currently everyting cute , sorry ... btw . 
  cool username . 
  is it an actual word ? 
  'cause that 's exactly what finnish looks like to me ; like you guys just piled up on vowels and there was n't enough left for us . 
  the last sentence of what / u/ivanow wrote is the essence of our problem . 
  oh , so you just have that special kind of hate for only that one country , or are there others too ? 
  you 're so biased , i 'm actually impressed it was n't that obvious in your earlier posts . 
  i wo n't be crying you anything but the way you got so worked up you outed yourself in such a lame manner would be funny if it were n't so sad . 
  i wo n't waste my time on your prejudice . 
   i consider poland an eastern country because it is the most conservative , religious , backward country in europe . 
  which is exactly the stereotype we have on eastern people . 
  whatever your * we * are , i am comfortably sure they are not all like you , and by a large margin . 
  you 're a special kind of snowflake . 
  for real . 
   besides , it does n't seam to bother you to call greeks dumb . 
  lol . 
  ever heard of socrates ? 
  * `` i know that i know nothing '' * . 
  `` playing the greek '' means pretending not to know about sth when that 's not the case , so * playing dumb * . 
  but knowing what i know now about you , ca n't really blame you for thinking everyone is as biased as you . 
  and , by the way , that * `` euskadi and a spanish ? 
  a catalan and a spaniard '' * was really lame . 
  i did n't ask about a mazovian vs. a silesian , or how kashubians differs from highlanders . 
  i asked about a pole and a romanian . 
  those are two big and populous countries , probably as different as it gets . 
  you 're trying too hard and you failed miserably . 
  seems like you 'll need it . 
  hate eats you up alive , you know ? 
  finnish words with a spanish accent of german production ... now , germany , you have a reputation for , * um * , the quality of your job done but , * ah * , somehow i fear it may be less than stellar ... or are we talking the entertainment factor ?!, 
  ;d for real though , how does finnish sound in spanish flavored german ? 
  westerners are those who are to the west from us . 
  and who were on the * brighter * side of the wall . 
  that simple . 
  and do n't play dumb ( or greek , as we call it ) , there 's no * putting them in the same bag * . 
  everyone can tell some differences between the french and germans , or tell apart a spaniard from a brit . 
  now , take a pole and a slovak and ask the average * westerner * what 's the difference . 
  or a pole and a romanian ? 
  seems more like a fair game . 
   being `` eastern '' does n't mean jack tho but it does . 
  because what poland is * the most * in europe is also * helples romantics * who care what 's being said . 
  that 's what you get from the people who were n't on the map for over a century and the only thing they could do was to say : * poland 's not yet lost . 
  * and who get worked up when france says marie curie is theirs ... chopin , the great french composer !, 
  copernicus , the german !, 
  and our national poet with his * `` o , lithuania !, 
  my fatherland ... '' * whom belarus likes too ... the thing that you do n't understand that for poles being called a certain thing * is * of importance highlights what i 'm talking about . 
  for you it does n't matter , for us it does . 
  so if it * does n't mean jack * ** how about you let us have it ? 
  ** btw . 
  being called car thieves , or * they take our jobs !, 
  * should n't matter too , but it did , and it does . 
  and it has real consequences . 
  ask romania how they feel about the gypsy stereotype . 
  and people not being able to tell the difference between * roma , romani * and * romanian * . 
  funny how they do n't get confused with * roman * ... 
  sure , but : [ lots of words , * sorry * , did n't plan it , * swear on jp2 * ! ], 
  when talking about geography there is n't really much room for opinions . 
  no matter how one would try to spin it geographically poland is right in the damn middle . 
  there . 
  and you listed * geography * , * politics * and * recent history * . 
  we have geography out . 
  politics ? 
  well , sure current government stems from middle * freaking * ages and acts like the ones we ousted in '89 but they 're in power only since oct ' 15 , the previous one was hardly * easternish * ( whatever that even means ? 
  dictatorial ? 
  nationalist ? 
  how 's brexit going ? 
  and have you heard recently from le pen ? 
  true finns would like a word . ) ... 
  see my point ? 
  being wary of russia ca n't be use against us anymore ... 
  * that leaves recent history . 
  something tells me you 're not considering the half of germany that ended up on the wrong side of the wall * eastern yurop * . 
  * now what we have in mind when we think we 're not eastern is : different religion , and with it different influences from the very beginning - that 's culture , that 's alphabet , how cities were founded , how law was created . 
  we 're not orthodox , we do n't use cyrylic . 
  we were watching rome , not constantinople . 
  well , sure we like spirits and dark bread but so do nordics . 
  take cuisine : as much , if not more , in common with germany or austria as with russia or ukraine . 
  weird blend of german , italian , eastern slavic , jewish , turkish and hungarian influences . 
  there 's baltic herring and tatar but soup vegetables you can still buy in one pack called * w\u0142oszczyzna * [ literally : italian things ] , courtesy of bona sforza . 
  monarchs imported from france , sweden , hungary , italy , germany did their thing . 
  the catholic boner and * antemurale of christendom * did too ... then that petite pushy frenchman that went for moscov and failed ... we share things with people we were one country with ( lithuania [ those balts , though ! ], 
  ukraine , belarus ) , or the rest of the slavs , some sentiments , but there 's much less in common than people ( especially western europeans ) think . 
  just cause they do n't know the difference , it 's all one to them , does n't mean that 's the case .
