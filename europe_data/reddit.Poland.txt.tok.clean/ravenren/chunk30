  frankly , i think it 's been enough time in the last 27 years to get off of the high horse and get informed , but that 's just me . 
  if you ask poles if they feel * western * , the answer is no . 
  if you tell them to choose between western and eastern europe , majority probably will choose east [ slavs , that side of the wall , we think of westerners as * them * , etc. ] . 
  but if you ask them what they are , they 'll tell you * central * . 
  we do n't have the * northern * part going for us like the baltic triplets do . 
  wrong side of the baltic , sorry . 
  wrong side of the alps to aspire for * south * like the balkans !, 
  our palmtrees are fake or potted , * duh * . 
  * central * is not to spite and be antagonistic , it just seems like the only * right * thing . 
  the fact that * still * current divide east/west stems from the soviet sphere of influence , makes people touchy on the subject . 
  you have here one wordy example !, 
  ;d btw . 
  i was both replying to you and to the guy below who asked what we consider ourselves , so it 's not an angry rant or somethnig . 
  i was just trying to show our point of view and just packed it all in one comment . 
  and * our * is of course divided into oblivion , because : `` where two poles , there three political parties , from which two are in coalition and one in crisis . '', 
  and that 's an old joke but when you think about it that perfectly illustrates that middle place when you have something in common with everyone around but then they 're not really * us * . 
  ( but by that definition we 're all special snowflakes , i guess ! ), 
  they 're not * too poor * , they 're * too cheap * !, 
  there 's a difference . 
  those really too poor of course exist but let 's not kid ourselves , that 's minority as for the reason ... 
  so we * do * have something in common ... after all these years . 
   it is , geography , politics and recent history only confirm that except geography does n't . 
  * no kuurwa !, 
  * which means : * well , of course !, 
   * in 1802 , napoleon added a polish legion of around 5,200 to the forces sent to saint-domingue to fight off the slave rebellion . 
  upon arrival , discovering that the slaves fought off their french masters for their freedom , many poles eventually joined the slaves against the french . 
  [ 2 ] the polish had a familiar situation back home , where they fought for their liberty against invading russia , prussia and austria that began in 1772 ; seeking to unite , some joined napoleon 's army ( of which part was sent to haiti ) . 
  [ 2 ] many polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the french army and join the slaves , and participated in the haitian revolution of 1804 . 
  [ 5 ] the community partially descends from the 400 surviving polish legionnaries that either defected to the slaves or were taken prisoner . 
  [ 1 ] these poles were naturalised according to the new haitian constitution . 
  [ 1 ] dessalines called polish people `` the white negroes of europe '' , which was then regarded a great honour , as it meant brotherhood between poles and haitans . 
  many years later , papa doc reminded about this concept when referring to polish people . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] for their loyalty and support for overthrowing the french , the poles acquired haitian citizenship after haiti gained its independence , and settled there to never return to poland . 
  to this day , many polish haitians still live in haiti and are of mixed racial origin , however some have blonde hair , light eyes , and other european features . 
  most settled in cazale , la vall\u00e9e-de-jacmel , fond-des-blancs , la baleine , port-salut and saint-jean-du-sud . 
  * [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_haitians ), 
  meaning : nearly every average pole can afford it . 
  as in * common * . 
  if it helps , the first , and only , thing that i associate with moldova is wine . 
  aw , man , i was just fondly reminiscing the circlejerk where everybody from austria to lithuania claim they have the middle . 
  everybody in between and around , and belarus too !, 
  it did not break up , it got anschlussed by czechoslovakia , look !, 
  can we argue who 's in the middle already ? 
  to make this * our * thing is the best we could do about it . 
  and for some reason i find this fact very funny . 
  ah , the first thing i did this year !, 
  woke up just in time . 
  i have on my bucket list to be there just one time in person . 
  one day ... 
  i 'd say it 's completely up to us whether it is meaningless or not ... basic rules of the universe do n't change , hence the message does n't change . 
  it 's just that people do n't like obvious simple truths that require them to move and act . 
  hope you had a merry christmas there . 
  and happy new year !, 
  * `` women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves , as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer . 
  thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals , as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life . 
  '' * poland 101 . 
  i want more !, 
  is there more ? 
  people who come up with something like this are definitely my kind of people !, 
  say , belarus , are n't you feeling , * um * , union-ish recently ? 
  the other map with women told me i 'm most likely turkish , it got me thinking ... crazy govt ? 
  checked . 
  white and red flag ? 
  checked . 
  likes turkish delight & strong coffee ... they might be onto somethnig . 
  i know that every death is equal , no matter how famous or talented someone was , but , jesus christ , that 's a tragedy . 
  of all things russian , they were my favourite . 
  whatever coherent i might have had to say , drowned in that beat my heart skipped . 
  * not yet lost . 
  * as per usual . 
   polish people from the demographic who uses the internet frequently happen to be right-wingers . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  i wholeheartedly agree with all you wrote here ; having said that , i ca n't afford to lose hope . 
  nope . 
  821 days 22 hours 28 minutes and 27 seconds till the next elections ... 
  only half . 
  i thought we 're smarter than that ... 
  but that 's common recently around here . 
  thanks germoney bros !, 
  also , do n't mind our current govt - they 're hell-bent on making everyone hate us . 
  we just need to wait them through ... 
  that was funny up until it stopped being funny and started looking like a real possibility . 
  now it 's just scary . 
  i just hope the eu wo n't kick us out . 
  thinking that they could save us from ourselves would probably be too much ... 
  i think jesus approves . 
  what / u/amekxone said and he announced that there will be extensive consultations with experts of all kinds and a thoroughly prepared , responsible reform that we deserve . 
  i think we 're in the clear here . 
  his speech was pretty damn decent . 
  that would work in poland . 
  we always do the opposite ... 
  they wo n't get 60 % . 
  that 's exactly 3/5 we were talking about the whole week . 
  not gon na happen . 
  by the way , they would n't dare right now . 
  they would need a 60 % majority to repel a veto . 
  they do n't have that . 
  he vetoed the two tied together bills that they tried to screw him over with . 
  that 's basically a * fuck you * to kaczy\u0144ski . 
  i 'd say this is grand .
