  he really lived up to his position . 
  there 's still the third one , but this is already fantastic .

  ** what happend to your russian flair you were sporting before ? 
  ** i remember you because bashing poland seems to be your favourite pastime ... and now all morphed into a german ? 
  how suitable !, 
  tho you 're probably neither , just a troll ... that 's sad . 
  comment history going only a month back ( is that when you made your transition ? 
  ) , account one year old and karma from the last month not amouting to your overall number ... 
  i guess they had to go together with your * russian * identity ; ca n't have the evidence laying there in full sight ? 
  or does caring for one 's privacy now contain changing nationalities ? 
  or did you just move to germany from that awful eastern europe ? 
  pathetic . 
   the historical importance of the polish cochineal is still reflected in most modern slavic languages where the words for the color red and for the month of june both derive from the proto-slavic * \u010d\u044crv\u044c ( probably pronounced [ t\u0361\u0283\u012drw\u012d ] ) , meaning `` a worm '' or `` larva '' . 
   in the czech language , as well as old bulgarian , this is true for both june and july , the two months when harvest of the insect 's larvae was possible . 
   [ polish cochineal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_cochineal ) ( porphyrophora polonica ) , also known as polish carmine scales , is a scale insect formerly used to produce a crimson dye of the same name ( ... ) before the development of aniline , alizarin , and other synthetic dyes , the insect was of great economic importance . 
   polish cochineal was widely traded in europe during the middle ages and the renaissance . 
  in the 15th and 16th centuries , along with grain , timber , and salt , it was one of poland 's chief exports , mainly to southern germany and northern italy as well as to france , england , the ottoman empire , and armenia . 
  the more you know . 
  looks kinda murican ; street and sidewalk , i think . 
  i like that building on the left that looks like it could n't decide what style it is ... 
  i think i have [ a perfect song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anugi6l1tm4 ) for these days ... 
  wise words . 
  though , i do n't really agree with the last sentence , it seems to me people are rather aware that there 's this , * um * , * duality * to her . 
  and hey !, 
  we can argue about copernicus , if you want !, 
  or just did n't get the joke , chill . 
  your reaction to the white flag joke was n't any better , man . 
  i 'll start making popcorn . 
   there was no jewish school of science at that time . 
  you mean * that * web comic * lied * to me ? 
  b-but ... for real though , i do n't know why he made such an overall statement , because every polish school i attended to taught me he was german . 
  but they probably know all the dirty secrets !,

  does anyone even read the actual content anymore ? 
  the idiom here is the whole expression you translated - a horse doing something - that carries another meaning beyond that horse is doing literaly what it 's doing in that sentence . 
  the sole word is not an idiom , and you used a wrong word translating , so that you failed to convey the meaning . 
  yeah , you explained what that expression means , how we use it , but that horse is not combining anything , that horse is figuring out how to do something , it 's plotting , scheming , trying and so on . 
  but * combine * means someting totally different than * kombinowa\u0107 * in that sense/context . 
  it 's not a literal translation , nor any other translation . 
  those words are just false friends in this case . 
  not an ounce of the actual meaning overlaps ( in that context ) . 
  the polish word has the double meaning , the english does n't . 
  it 's like you 'd translate our * p\u00f3\u0142noc * into english * north * when the sentence is about * midnight * , and then said you wanted to keep it literal . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  * p\u00f3\u0142noc = midnight , p\u00f3\u0142noc = north * , but * midnight / = north * . 
  * to combine * means to bring together some things . 
  and you have that in polish in the word * kombinacja * , like * a combination of two ingredients * - * kombinacja dw\u00f3ch sk\u0142adnik\u00f3w * . 
  so , * to combine different ingredients - kombinowa\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cne sk\u0142adniki * - in the sense that you join them together , * that 's * a literal translation here . 
  english * to combine * does n't have the meaning * to scheme * , or * to figure something out * and the like . 
  hope i make any sense before coffee ... 
   2002 ah , so it might as well be from a century ago ; just as accurate . 
  what 's the point in sharing something so out of touch ? 
   should n't that be `` to scheme '' or something like that ? 
  yep . 
  my dad says it all the time . 
  monkeys are plural , though . 
  this is terrible . 
  17 * missing * is going to morph into 17 * will be missed * . 
  i know they ca n't say anything until they actually * know * for sure but for some reason that phrase always angers me . 
  like * the missing * after the grenfell fire ; just heartbreaking . 
  there 's nothing about what bus it was , i wonder which country 's tourists wo n't be returning home ... so fucking sad . 
  same here . 
  and the fact that they 're just ordinary everyday things like trams or mailboxes that differs from country to country ? 
  personally , i like that the most . 
  but parliaments and coasts were great too .

   the only english speaking country kinda bailed out of eu ireland would like a word . 
  do n't worry , it took me a second look to realise that too ... 
  fun fact : today poland does n't border any of the countries it bordered in 1989 . 
  or does it ?

  tell , eesti , are you much into [ * jabols * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jabol ) ? 
  you just wait for us !, 
  society consists of individuals . 
  faith is an individual thing . 
  in that one aspect it should be very easy to achieve the ideal . 
  the only reason we can not do that are people who think they know better what others should do , and are pushy and agressive about it . 
  a little more respect for a fellow human and it 'd be perfect . 
  oh , actually , it is * that * simple . 
  it 's just that the know-it-alls on both sides ca n't wrap their minds around that . 
  what i think is right is not pushing what you believe , or do n't believe in onto other people . 
  just let people live . 
  people so annoying that you want to do the exact opposite of what they 're saying just to spite them ? 
  yeah , no . 
  and i 'm an atheist ; they give us all a bad name . 
  maybe they just slapped it there to have one available if there ever arise a need for , * uh * , say , u-turn ? 
  yep , and we have the freedom boner bigger than ` murica !, 
  we should better stop it right now , before they create / r/shitpolessay or somethnig ... , 
   the culture is still more backwards that 's not a linear thing , you know . 
  there were times when it was safer to be gay in poland than in france , or when the jews from all over europe flung to poland and called it their paradise . 
  when the french were slaughtering each other over religion polish-lithuanian commonwealth had the level of religious freedom unmatched anywhere in europe . 
  who 's to say things wo n't be changing again ?
