  my favourite fact was always that we abolished corporal punishment in schools in 1783 . 
  sweden known for not beating their offspring has taken until 1928 to do that . 
  there 's plenty things we did that were pretty progressive at the time , some things changed only to be changed again , and again . 
  that can happen anywere . 
  imagine that le pen wins , what then ? 
  will kids in the next century laugh at the backward france ? 
  and when they will try and defend themselves that they were different once , will they get what poland 's getting now ? 
  the wheel of fortune is a thing , you know ? 
  and we were on a pretty good track up until the last elections . 
  * sigh . 
  * edit : can not into spelling, 
  eh , we [ won ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:nicolas_sarkozy_in_polish_parliament_ ( 2008 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  that 's the late twin , though . 
  but we have a copy !, 
  seconded !, 
  yes , i 'm aware ; still , it felt weird to see that . 
  * heeey * , we 're gon na get through that ... 
  * right ? 
  i do n't even know if i should be happy that we did n't start to kill each other over this yet , or worried that there 's a count ... * ahahah * ^ * aha * ^ * ha * ^ * haa * ... 
  this is glorious . 
  hi there , fellow merkels . 
  turns out i am the * hidden german option * after all ... * hmph * . 
  [ removed ], 
  we use * break a leg * but plural - * po\u0142amania n\u00f3g * ; before an exam it may turn into * break a pen/quill * - * po\u0142amania pi\u00f3ra * . 
  also , you 're not supposed to thank for that as that may bring bad luck , but since not saying anything seems rude many people say literally `` i * do n't * thank you '' ... 
  i do n't remember what i was on about , lol , sorry ;d, 
   she was being constantly made fun of by people and media that 's just bullshit . 
  a right-winger in a talkshow does n't count as * constantly * and the general * media * . 
  what media ? 
  tvp was civilized back then , non of the mainstream would dare to do that . 
  tv trwam ? 
  tv republika ? 
  that 's two . 
  did anybody even hear about tv republika 6 year ago ? 
  and about the press ? 
  maybe some right-wing/catholic . 
  but i dare to say there 's more liberal and left-wing press in poland . 
  i can vividly remember paw\u0142owicz * being paw\u0142owicz * and her remarks , and the rest of pis , no brainer . 
  but that 's about it . 
   most people believe that being gay is a mental illness and makes you a rapist / pervert . 
  you use general statements where they do n't apply . 
  that one halved would still not be true . 
  by and large . 
   it 's even worse for trans people , they should be locked up and isolated from the society . 
  citation ? 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa with * the last row * made headlines in what , 2013 ? 
  korwin made such statements about the disabled and that was a big scandal . 
  korwin , paw\u0142owicz and pi\u0119ta are about 3 people who then , while not in power , made such statements . 
  being against gay marriage and saying * `` that being gay is a mental illness and makes you a rapist / pervert . 
  '' * are two different things . 
  also , you mention in another thread that you 're 22 , i daresay you do n't remember how it was 6 years ago , and are just projecting what is now . 
  those times are worlds apart . 
  if it was as bad as you 're trying to paint it neither biedro\u0144 , nor grodzka would get elelcted . 
  the people of s\u0142upsk elected the openly gay biedro\u0144 as their mayor * after * he was in parliament , for god 's sake !, 
  that being said , pis in power makes it looks worse than it is because they , and now their supporters , are vocal . 
  and that 's an understatement ; they do n't shut up even for a minute . 
  but you just completely disregarded all the people voting left - they did n't disappear just becuase there 's no their representation in the parliament . 
  and if sld was single and not in coalition , they would be in . 
  there 's also razem . 
  at least half of po is civilized in that subject , i daresay the majority of . n. 
  what about them ? 
  do n't fit your narration that poland sucks ? 
  lewandowski being a fairly new addition  lechu , yep !, 
  though , never seen a one without chopin . 
   age 5 : asked to go to the local corner shop to buy bread , flour etc. 
  and  i see children as young as 5 or 6 doing it . 
  though , my use of * wander * is obviously a hyperbole . 
  but still , 5 is no age to go anywhere by yourself . 
  and you still did n't specify in what environment that was . 
  a city ? 
  a small town ? 
  a tiny village ? 
  of course , that 's not your personal experience that i 'm questioning , it 's that you said you see it today that i find strange . 
  anytime there 's a poll/research/whatever * what do foreigners know about poland ? 
  * chopin , curie and jp2 are the top answers . 
  i have trouble to believe that * no one * knows about curie . 
  really . 
  seems to me those are just those who know literaly nothing about her , and not that she was french over polish . 
  wikipedia in every language i checked lists fairly clearly both . 
  same with conrad . 
  how would one learn one without the other ? 
  ** edit : ** not a one real answer/discussion just downvotes , thank you , everyone !, 
  how is this comment not relevant/appropriate ? 
  * ah , * it is n't . 
  thanks again . 
  that 's the first thing i asked because it seems like the only sensible option . 
  certainly it 's not universal throughout the country for 5 year-olds to wander unsupervised . 
  5 or 6 is a big difference at that age . 
  a 7 year-old going to school or the corner shop by themselves is totally fine , but a 5 year-old would raise eyebrows . 
  and probably someone would call the cops . 
  i 'd never let a child that small go anywhere by themselves . 
  not just 'cause someone would rat me out but a child that young just lacks the capacity to be on their own out there . 
  it might be different in the rural setting when the parent has the kid in sight all the time when they go to the shop on the other side/end of the street and back but any other option is just wrong . 
  a 5 year-old with money at that ... and if something happens , the parents are done . 
  btw , in most elevators there 's a sign saying that children under the age of 12 ca n't ride without an adult . 
  if an accident were to happen , the parents are responsible . 
  i 'm 28 , from one of the biggest cities , a quiet neighbourhood though ; i was 7 when i started to go out by myself . 
  and from my observation that age seems to rise and not the other way around . 
  but the older i get the smaller/younger the kids seem , how can you tell a 5 year-old from a 6 or 7 year-old ? 
  i see parents walk the children to school ( so at least 6/7 ) and they look much younger than i 'd have thought .
