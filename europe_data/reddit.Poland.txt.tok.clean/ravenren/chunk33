  btw . 
  here a * \u017babka * is a corner store . 
   said at the top , poland . 
  yeah , i can see that , * where * in poland ? 
  cyprus had the right idea , everybody knows them by sheer shape and finding them on the map is that much easier . 
  dear op , i would say just * nationals * , not * nationalists * . 
  and i would add emilia plater to the list . 
  edit : does joseph conrad count ? 
  though , i 've never seen anyone fight over him . 
   age 5 : asked to go to the local corner shop to buy bread , flour etc. 
   age 10 : left alone with sister at night how old are you ? 
  and where from ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure that would be illegal now . 
  technically , you should n't left unattended a child under the age of 12 . obviously , younger children go out alone to play , or to go to school , but a 5 year-old alone in a shop would n't go well ... 
  some also ask if one has a tail ... 
  have you tried listening to portuguese music ? 
  you should really check some fado if you have n't !, 
  that embarrassing moment when you transfer english syntax onto your native language , or forget how something is in your language altogether ... 
  they should rename it to * off-bot * ... 
   extreme predescriptivist the only extreme thing here is your attitude . 
  there 's nothing * extreme * about actually abiding by the rules . 
  that rule book is called a dictionary . 
  and the word you 're looking for is prescriptivist . 
  descriptivist is another word ; and as long as polish is a phonetic language and we 're talking about what * is * , it does n't apply in this subject . 
   there 's really no reason to consider sz\u0142a as correct but sz\u0142em as incorrect . 
  again , what * is * . 
  linguists engage in all kind of considerations , but as i 'm aware the polish language board has n't changed a thing yet . 
  i think you should use * posz\u0142em * in your cv and then you could tell us how that went , * hm ? 
  * you 're so sure of yourself , should suffice . 
   same as above . 
  that 's also not a mistake . 
  that 's just standart consonant reduction that occurs everywhere in polish . 
  unless you say mie\u015b\u0107ski instead of miejski and bia\u0142ostoczski instead of bia\u0142ostocki . 
  are you from the future ? 
  talking about changes that have n't occured yet ? 
  where it has changed , it is changed . 
  where it has n't , it 's a mistake . 
  that simple . 
  we 're talking about the current language , contemporary usage by the people of today , and the rules of now , not what could 've been . 
  and * same as above * , as long as polish is a phonetic language ... and that dictionary thing . 
  yep . 
  it 's about the standard polish , otherwise there 's no topic at all . 
  and you know it . 
  imagine there are people who think this is about manners and not their child 's safety . 
  the geniuses we all are , a surprisingly large part of poles have an inexplicable problem with the word * wzi\u0105\u0107 * . 
  the amount of people who say * wzi\u0105\u015b\u0107 * instead of * wzi\u0105\u0107 * is astonishing . 
  now , it 's a harsh looking word you 'd think , but it means just * to take * ... people take breaks and showers , they take their kids places and their dogs for walks , they take umbrellas and holidays , they take their pills every morning , and they still say it wrong . 
  * also , the masculine form of * i went * - * ( ja ) poszed\u0142em * . 
  nope . 
  though , that 's a mistake not just a pronunciation case . 
  but how common it is that you * went * somewhere to * take * something ... our famous statesman j\u00f3zef * pi\u0142sudski * , more often than not , becomes * piu\u0142sudzki * . 
  i bet he 's thrilled . 
  then 600 . if our lives depended on saying it perfectly , the death toll would be better than after the swedish deluge . 
  it should be * sze\u015b\u0107set * . 
  it 's super straightforward , it 's just * sze\u015b\u0107-set * - six-hundred . 
  but no , we make a * szejset * out of it , and that 's how you have more poles correctly pronouncing * seicento * than * sze\u015b\u0107set * . 
  * trzy * - three ; some make it * czy * - whether ... 300 - * trzysta * becomes * czysta * - clean/pure * ( f. ) * . 
  if your number starts with 603 you ded . 
  and for all that is holy ... the word * czcionka * - font . 
  you know , like times new roman , they want to be super proper , and that 's why they say * trzcionka * ... red up , white down , everything upside down . 
  have you seen my plunger ? 
  but then everybody correctly , in beautiful * polszczyzna * , introduces themselves as * grzegorz brz\u0119czyszczykiewicz * , from * chrz\u0105szczy\u017cewoszyce , \u0141\u0119ko\u0142ody * county , and then encourages you to start learning polish with : * w szczebrzeszynie chrz\u0105szcz brzmi w trzcinie . 
  * and if you 're american , or australian , you 're gon na be scolded that you 're pronouncing * ko\u015bciuszko * wrong , and why did n't you know that he was born in mereczowszczyzna ?!, 
  * really !, 
  * ah * , we just made a * serwetka * out of it , or * serweta * if it 's a really large * serwetka * . 
  * ciemny jak tabaka w rogu * - dark like a snuff in a horn ; meaning stupid . 
  now , poles have an interesting relationship with that saying just because most people are n't aware of its origins . 
  * w rogu * may mean both * in the corner * or * in a horn * . 
  in the old days snuffboxes were made out of hollowed bovine horns . 
  i spent a good chunk of my childhood wondering why would anyone put a snuff in the corner ... then some years ago i 've seen some tv show where they were talking to the people on the street , asking them about the meaning of some popular sayings and it turned out that that mystery is not limited to children . 
  on the other hand , some people , especially elderly women , have an annoying habit of putting their hands on babies in strollers , touching their faces ; * without * asking . 
  and , though that happens mostly with incorrigible grandmas and elderly aunts , people who try to * clean * the toddler by sticking a tissue/handkerchief into their mouths and then smearing their saliva all on the kid 's face/hands . 
  that 's one category for me . 
  it 's called : keep your germs to yourself for f 's sake . 
  and they keep trying to pet my dog too . 
  the cherry on top are young mummies telling their 3 year-old to go pet the stranger 's doggie . 
  a permission ? 
  what would you need that for ? 
   50 versions of the same sound but does n't that make them all different sounds ? 
  apparently they just ca n't make out a difference between * \u0107 / cz/dz/d \u017a * . 
  i 've had classes with a british native speaker when i was a kid and she made that really simple : she put a mirror in front of me , told me to put my tongue between my front teeth and make a sound . 
  three/free was exactly how i 've learned that . 
  [ * one day more * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxgcrhievwu ) from * les mis\u00e9rables * in warsaw . 
  * nah * , mainly because there 's no routine - that was my first motivation . 
  sometimes i stay up all night doing work stuff , then sleep in till noon and get up only to make necessary phone calls/emails when normal people are at work . 
  other times i get up at 4 a.m. and overly excited do my part while thinking that i 'll be done and over before my friends even arrive at their jobs ( oh , schadenfreude !, 
  ) , and then i will have all day to myself ; that 's super motivating !, 
  ( house cleaning also works best in the wee hours of the morning ; ca n't explain . ), 
  sometimes i just get up like a normal human being around 6 or 7 and still in my night time attire start working only to discover that it 's 13 and i 'm done but have n't brush me teeth yet . 
  but whatever version happens , i 'm always happy that i do n't have to do 8-16 like other people . 
  and my dog is never alone !, 
  if i want , i can binge-watch tv shows instead of working , and then * binge-work ? 
  * afterwards , and if i meet all the deadlines no one 's any smarter ( and if i do n't , they do n't know why !, 
  - * put a calamity-preventing-you-from-working of your choice in here * - that never happens , though . 
  * haha * ) . 
  my morning coffee can fluently transform into working and there are no hard feelings about actually going to work . 
  i also tend to have music playing most of the time - no one around to think otherwise . 
  and i work better alone , and like working at night . 
  for me , there are only positives in it . 
  work from home ; best life choice ever .
