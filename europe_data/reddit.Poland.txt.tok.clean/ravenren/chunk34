  i 've never measured but i 'm willing to bet it 's under 50 steps ; usually takes less than a minute . 
  though , if you 'd count coffee and pee , might be a lil ' bit more . 
  or more specifically * \u0142acina podw\u00f3rkowa * - backyard latin . 
   the last sunlit hours before the actual evening . 
  that 's a perfect definition . 
  so obvious , yet i did n't think to put it this way . 
  mental note to self to use it if i ever have to explain to someone what our * podwiecz\u00f3r * means !, 
  unlimited calls , unlimited sms/mms , 15gb ( after that it slows down a little ) 4g for like 12 $ . 
  yeah , i 'm good . 
  judging by * zapadati * vs * zapada\u0107 * , i bet that * tmina * is related to our * ciemna/ciemno \u015b\u0107 * . 
  though without the context it does n't look familiar . 
  and here i was imagining something akin to * sleepless in seattle * ... 
   zapad from zapadati - fall behind so over there it 's the sun who 's falling ? 
  here it 's the darkness . 
  * zapada zmrok * - darkness/dusk falls or , you know , just nightfall . 
  the sun here * zachodzi * so literally - goes behind . 
  i love the heck out of this thread . 
  sure . 
  that was a mental shortcut , if you will . 
  i 've met once a girl named * jutrzenka * , but that 's as unusual as it gets . 
  we have * \u015bwitanie * too !, 
  you may find my other [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6eth3c/when_you_refer_to_an_approximate_time_of_day/dicxwny/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) interesting , or just the ending of it ... ( too many words , trying to stop ) . 
  * rano jutro * meaning early morning , while * rano * not meaning morning in that sentence hurts my brain ... ;d and i just realised we have * jutrzenka * for dawn . 
  but that 's uberpoetic . 
  the greek goddess eos is called * jutrzenka * in polish , and i think there was something about it in the slavic mythology too . 
  also * zorza * means literary aurora , now that i brought mythology into it . 
  * jutro * means tomorrow in polish . 
  there 's a joke in there somewhere . 
  and we have * zorza * too , but that 's like superpoetic . 
  and the best one - * pono\u0107 * means apparently in polish . 
  i think that that joke is when a croat and a pole are trying to set up a meeting and they came up with * pono\u0107 - jutro * and maybe even to * podpodne * , and then the pole shows up a day late wearing an aqualung ... * podwodne * - underwater ... 
  you 're telling me there 's not a romantic comedy movie under that title yet ? 
  no way !, 
  midnight whlie on the eiffel tower must be fun in hungarian . 
  let 's see ... * * nad ranem * - literally `` over morning '' ; morning is near but not quite yet - 3-5 , i 'd say . 
  * * rano * - morning ; anywhere between 5 and 9 ` something , maybe . 
  * haha ... * * * po\u0142udnie * - noon ; vaguely 11-13 * * popo\u0142udnie * - afternoon ; 13-17/18 * * pod wiecz\u00f3r * - literally `` under evening '' - 17/18-19 ; * evening is coming . 
  * if someone invites you to * podwieczorek * - expect tea/coffee and cookies around this time , or maybe some open sandwich ... * * wiecz\u00f3r * - evening ; 19-21 * * noc * - night ; * duh . 
  * * * p\u00f3\u0142noc * - midnight there could also be * pora poobiednia * - `` after-dinner time '' but that one is relative - when do you eat ? 
  and is it monday or sunday ? 
  also * obiad * - dinner ; can mean anything between 12-16 ; and then if you work till 17 you 'll eat around 18 anyway ... * drugie \u015bniadanie * - second breakfast ; is usually around 10 . and just like in swedish we also have * doba * for 24h period . 
  i find it confusing that in english it 's sometimes referred to as * day * ; for me * a day * is 12h of sunlight . 
  ** edit : ** * fun fact * : the words for noon/midday and midnight / ( is there any other word for midnight ? ), 
  are also the words for south and north ; * po\u0142udnie * means noon and south , * p\u00f3\u0142noc * means midnight and north . 
  [ and they 're literally half-day and half-night ] meta.edit : - which is exactly midday/midnight , now that i think of it , * oh well * ... and while i 'm at it - the words for east , west - respectively * wsch\u00f3d * , * zach\u00f3d * , come from the verbs - to rise , to set - * wschodzi\u0107 * , * zachodzi\u0107 * - so it 's nearly impossible to confuse the facts that * the sun rises on the east and sets on the west * . 
  it was n't until someone in askreddit pointed that out that they tend to mix those , that i realised it 's not so obvious in english . 
  ** edit : ** more * me thinkin ' : * * po\u0142udniowe s\u0142o\u0144ce * can mean both sunshine at noon and that you 're in the tropics . 
  also , * na zachodzie * means in the west , but * o zachodzie * means `` when the sun is setting '' . 
  if they invite you to a * schadzka o wschodzie na zachodzie * - you 're in for a secret date at dawn , but go west if you decide on going at all . 
  you could also start with how her eyes are looking lovely * o brzasku * ... * brzask * is a really nice word for a dawn . 
  and * zmierzch * its counterpart for twilight . 
  i 'm shutting up now . 
  ** edit : ** no , i 'm not , i have more . 
  morning apart from * rano * can be also * poranek * . 
  * brzask * can be also named less fancy - * \u015bwit * - sunrise . 
  and while * o \u015bwicie * is a fairly normal way to say `` at sunrise '' , if you 'll go with * o \u015bwitaniu * , you 're gon na need singing birds and a virgin in white ... [ more like poetry ] i 'll be back when i come up with more . 
  that was a really good question you know , / u/werkstadt !, 
  alexander graham bell, 
  oh , * you * , fabulousgoat , you 'd just like to join !, 
  there 's also the * warsaw vs. krak\u00f3w * thing , and * warsaw vs. everybody else * ... 
  oh , god . 
  tymbark juices are mainstream now , man !, 
  i 've seen them in germany , and on some photos from south east asia ; probably safe to assume they 're in the uk too . 
  i wonder how it 's executed ; i mean , they 're * secret * ... 
  that 's interesting !, 
  we use the elder/the younger - * starszy/m \u0142odszy * but mostly in relation to brothers , the only father/son pair called that ( that i can think of ) are the brueghels . 
  native * ojciec/syn * . 
  though , i think the most common is to only specify the son . 
  so it 's * dumas * and * dumas syn * . 
  [ they say that brevity is the soul of wit , apparently i 'm witless , sorry ! ], 
  merci !, 
  i think we could say it 's like a more refined version of what we call just * cultural references * ; those can be as fresh as recent mems , all the way through the cult movies , to the classic literature and history . 
  whether it 'd be sport , ww2 , the bible , quoting bismarck or pi\u0142sudski , dante 's divine comedy , or some current yoghurt ad in tv we 'd still lump them all together into * muh culture !, 
  * ( ours and the world 's together ) . 
  i 'd say yours seems so quintessential french ; has a fancy name and you 're more sophisticated if you can participate , no ? 
  well , from my outsider 's point of view at least . 
  while we here will think one 's just an uneducated idiot and should go back to school when they do n't get it , but that 's probably because we tend to mix the obvious with the highbrow . 
  i really like those which mix both in one joke , though . 
  you probably caught our foreign minister , witold waszczykowski , inventing a new country of [ san escobar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_escobar ) recently ? 
  '' * [ finish ( that ) , waszcz , save the embarrassment ] ; that 's a pun on a quote from [ henryk sienkiewicz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henryk_sienkiewicz ) 's xix century novel * [ the deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_deluge_ ( novel \\ ) ) * ; the main character loses a duel and while laying on the ground he says to his opponent - * ko\u0144cz , wa\u015b\u0107 , wstydu oszcz\u0119d\u017a !, 
  '' * [ finish ( me ) , sir , save the shame ] . 
  so , a recent blunder and a classic literature , but so famous and so enrooted in the polish identity that we just called it * the * trilogy ( even the english wiki [ does ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_trilogy ) , * hah * ) , so if you 're polish and you do n't recognize it you really should keep that to yourself , unless you want to be thought a fool . 
  i think i like your version better . 
  edit : formatting, 
  an example of the trait d'esprit , s ` il vous pla\u00eet !, 
  my definition of comfy food is : filling - always , tastes better than it looks - usually , warm - probably , only needs a single utensil - comfy - you do n't need to look what you 're doin ' . 
  if it 's a hassle to make ( pierogi , bigos ) , usually you can buy a decent ready-to-eat version here . 
  potato pancakes , pierogi ruskie , rice baked with apples and cinnamon , rice with strawberry sauce , tomato soup with [ * lane kluski * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kluski ) , sour cucumber soup , bigos , pasta with whatever , nutella straight from the jar . 
  i also have a thing for a hot potato with butter and salt , just like that . 
  i tried to narrow it down to the kinda * national specific * things . 
  and nutella . 
  because nutella . 
  but truth be told usually i end up with some veggies + chicken/rice stir-fry . 
  the more absurd , the better . 
  rather dark . 
  lots of cultural references , and there 's a thing for self-depreciation but only the home team can play that one , otherwise we 're gravely offended . 
  :3 we also laugh at the germans , and the russians in the * a pole , a german , and a russian walk into a bar * kind of way . 
  usually it 's something silly and the clueless pole wins with something so simple it should n't have worked but it did , while the german does something sensible that fails , and the russian does something akin to what you can find on their dashcams that also fails . 
  horrible injuries for everyone , but * hey * , we won !, 
  hearing a czech speaking is also a reason for a good laugh .
