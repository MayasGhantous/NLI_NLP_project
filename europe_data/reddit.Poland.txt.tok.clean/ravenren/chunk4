  i really hope you lied about being an academic teacher . 
  how can students read and understand if the teacher does n't ? 
   what is the website address where you can check those numbers ? 
  i 've seen this spot twice and have no idea . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lp5wb6oxv1g#t=112 ) . 
  1m53s * `` sprawd\u017a autobus po numerze rejestracyjnym na www.bezpiecznyautobus.gov.pl '' * and then the adress is written in bold letters at the end . 
  read my [ reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/292u7x/sad_bus_most_cruel_video_by_any_government_ever/cihmlfr?context=3 ) to your other comment . 
  and stop fixating on * white * , please . 
  ** edit : ** also , because i just noticed you did n't understand the main point here . 
  you 're not reporting a bus so they could annihilate it . 
  you check if a bus was checked , evaluated and decided roadworthy , and then if it was n't you report it so they could check it , maybe * repair * it , surely prevent it from indirectly hurting a child . 
   why are all the shiny buses white ( the old ikarus being the one colored ) seriously ? 
  you 're suggesting there 's something * racist * about it ? 
  * wow . 
  * it 's kinda funny how you 're trying really hard to * `` read between the lines '' * but fail to see the main message that basically punches you right where it 's supposed to hurt the most . 
  to me , all the white busses are cold and aloof , white works for it , because you 're not supposed to sympathize with them . 
  the colorful one is a main hero . 
  he is the one that is meant to catch your attention and therefore sympathy - hence bright colors . 
  think : a modern white leather sofa with sharp edges * vs. * an old colorful cozy couch that even * looks * soft . 
   no parent in their right mind sends a kid on a shady looking bus . 
  i 'm willing to bet that those get reported more . 
  and yet every summer there are accidents involving children and a bus that was n't even supposed to be on the road . 
   the buses that do n't look it are more dangerous imho . 
  that 's what the app is for - convinient , easy , quick . 
  so that you could check * every * bus . 
   `` do n't repair , buy a new bus ! '', 
  -  spend , do n't mend . 
  would you want your child to travel in a shabby ikarus from the 80 's that barely keeps together , or new and most importantly * roadworthy * vehicle ? 
   this is also metaphorical of how we treat old people is this country you 're seeing things that are not there . 
   they could have just made the bus a pozer or douche . 
  that would completely miss the point .

  polan can into emotionally unstable . 
  ;d ok , i did n't see * that * coming ... but when you actually think about it ... 
  this video makes you * feel * for the bus . 
  * poor little bus with big sad eyes , all alone and helpless ... * most people sympathize . 
  * especially * parents who are the target group for it . 
  their default function is to protect their child . 
  it 's a reflex that 's transferred on all things small , cute , and helpless ... * like kids * . 
  they 're probably more prone to react to this video in the way that was intended by the authors , even if only subconsciously . 
  that 's why this video is oriented to play on one 's feelings . 
  less than a minute and you 're already hooked and all in * aww , poor little busy * mode . 
  then * busy * gets killed and you get hurt . 
  they want you to * feel * it . 
  and then they say that you should n't care about a bus , you should care about your child . 
  you 're upset about a cartoon vehicle with eyes , what if that was your kid ? 
  would you still care about cute bus or rather about an actual little human being that 's the most important thing in the world to you ? 
  i 'm not sure being polish improves understanding of this add , but i 'm convinced that being a parent is a major factor . 
  although it probably helps when you know that every year before summer holidays there 's some kind of campaign to educate people about safe travelling and especially to sensitize parents so that they themselves would make sure that a coach that is going to carry their kids across the country is safe , i.e. 
  if it was recently evaluated and pronounced roadworthy . 
  when i was a kid i remember every time before departure , be it for school trip or summer camp , parents called the cops and they arrived and tested drivers with a breathalyzer and if the vehicle had all needed papers ok . that was over a decade ago and still every summer happens an accident that involves children and a bus that was n't supposed to even be on the road . 
  and now that everyone has a smartphone all it takes is to open an app , enter a number , and see if the bus is on the list , ergo ok . it 's your kid 's life that 's at stake . 
  yeah . 
  i was already happy : * yay !, 
  butterfly . 
  sad little bus is going to be fine weee * ... 
  *** boom !, 
  *** * ... wtf ?!, 
  why did they ... * and then i got what this is about and thought : that 's devilishly clever . 
  bus that kills kids * is not * good . 
  it starts this way so that the contrast hit you more . 
  but that 's the point . 
  you start to care about the bus and * boom !, 
  * it 's dead . 
  you care about your child , you do n't want them dead . 
  so which one you 're willing to sacrifice : your child or an old bus ? 
  because that 's actually pretty good video . 
  * you 're sorry about a bus ? 
  you would be sorrier about your kid ... *, 
  so it would n't kill our young ... what the fuck did i just see ? 
  surely you 're not a parent , are you ? 
  summer \u2192 vacation \u2192 summer camps \u2192 children in coaches \u2192 accidents involving children caused by faulty coaches \u2192 companies saving money \u2192 coaches without a valid technical inspection \u2192 dead children \u2192 involving parents in exerting pressure for the sake of the safety of their children ... 
  i think they did good . 
  * pretty * good . 
  ** edit : ** i am * sorry * but what a moron did just downvote all my comments ? 
  that 's exactly what this campaign is about . 
  every year before summer holidays there 's talking about unsafe buses . 
   it 's something you have to think about twice our government actually succeeded in something ... maybe they should change profession ? 
  set up a publishing house . 
  or sth ... 
  i 'd think * bored * is n't bad in this case , all things considered ... 
  with families to feed ... yeah , * meh * , who cares ? 
  i 'd like to read it , is that weird ?

   `` m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois '' is not about the sexual act but 3 people actually living together ( not roommates ) . 
  same in polish , it describes polyamorous relationship + common household . 
  for act itself , threesome , we have colloquial * tr\u00f3jk\u0105t * , literally triangle . 
  professionally * tr\u00f3jk\u0105t * is * triolizm * , but the latter i only encountered in professional texts mentioning the subject . 
  we shipped our to canadians during ww2 , got everything back in 1946 , i bet they said they 're sorry ... , 
  * ohh * , it 's just a typo ? 
  i 'm a little disappointed , i thought we have something fancy going on here . 
  but , on the other hand , slavic things that start with capital * r * make me a little insecure , if you know what i mean ... 
   we do n't like your government either . 
  we do n't like them either , 
   in this thread : a bunch of people angry because the op has a russian flair i believe the word i need right now is * fremdsch\u00e4men * ...
