   i think kaczy\u0144ski had a cabinet of ministers picked the next day if i were our government caught on tape , i 'd say he 's been probably tending to his boner from the moment he saw that microscopic possibility of taking power . 
  ^ could n't ^ help ^ it . 
  ^ really ^ very ^ sorry . 
  make no mistake , miller and palikot would like too ... ^ i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out ... 
   the abw thugs instantly raiding the magazine 's offices . 
  well , under our law , recording people in private without their knowledge nor consent * is * criminal . 
  but , by the same law , journalists are bound to protect anonymity of their sources , so probably they could obtain a court order before they raided wprost 's office . 
   no law actively prohibits what they were * doing . 
  * did i miss something ? 
  they were just * talking * . 
  considering various options . 
  and last year there was n't a pole who would n't want rostowski kicked out for all his deeds , so the ones who now feign outrage are giant hypocrites . 
  if anything , i think that those tapes may eventually work for their benefit . 
  as ridiculous as it sounds , i think many people may actually realize that they 're not as meek and blind as it appears . 
  some strong opinions , something they really believe in and get worked up about ? 
  that 's good . 
  they want something for us at the expense of another country ? 
  well , i 'm afraid that 's realpolitik for you . 
  we * hired * them to take care of * our * business . 
  i 'm all for being nice and making friends with other countries , but we must be realistic . 
  i think the part with the blow job was spot-on if crude . 
  they actually made multiple accurate points that most people would agree with , but i 'm afraid many wo n't be able to see past profanities , and then there is pis and all of its spin-offs . 
  they 're making a show of monstrous outrage based on cringeworthy form and implying that 's also the case with the content . 
  of course the language was appaling but , * hey * , i 'm no saint . 
  thank god nobody eavesdrops political disputes in my house ... and for the record , i 'm not a fan of our government by any stretch , i did n't vote for them , but after hearing those i might just be a fan of sikorski . 
  lol . 
  by the way , my favorite parts , sans expletives , were sikorski saying that kaczy\u0144ski * welded * himself to macierewicz , and rostowski calling danuta h\u00fcbner an * old commie * , for which he publicly apologized to her and she replied she 's not offended by the * commie * but she wo n't comment on the rest ... , 
   we call it ue same here . 
  * hahaa * :d we had this running joke in high school : what are your first words while in germany ? 
  * the teacher , german himself , facepalmed . 
  we also had french classes , i was * sooo * excited that one day someone 's gon na * parlez-vous francais ? 
  * me and i 'll be able to respond with my impeccable french ... [ * dreamy eyes * ] but that quickly turned into * je ne comprends pas * ... 
  i still love french music , though . 
  aznavour performed in warsaw yesterday , i 'm told he still * has it * !, 
  become a mime and play charades . 
  lalala la la. . . * my german german teacher would be proud , i bet . 
  * i think , i 'm good . 
  * yep . 
  *** \u0142 **** aska * - grace/mercy/favor *** l **** aska * - walking stick/cane/blow job/or a really attractive girl ... in this context it 's unequivocal . 
  another way to say this is * zrobi\u0107 loda * ... [ * l\u00f3d * - ice cream ] btw . 
  that 's why we laugh our asses off when we hear czechs speaking , * l\u00e1ska * in czech means love  edit : and on a side note , * zrobi\u0107 komu\u015b \u0142ask\u0119 * has a rather pejorative meaning . 
   i visited hern\u00e1di [ zsolt , president and ceo of hungarian state petrochemical company mol , currently tried in croatia ... ] this is precious . 
  did n't know that !, 
  well , looks like he 's won in that ` do n't take yourself too seriously ' thing . 
  ** edit : ** did some research , waldorff 's dog was * puzon * [ trombone ] , not * fagot * [ bassoon ] . 
  for the interested : [ jerzy waldorff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerzy_waldorff ) was a highly respected music critic and author . 
  happened to be also gay , an aristocrat and an interesting figure in interesting times . 
   waldorff put on paper and elaborated the unwritten memoir of his own friend , the polish eminent pianist w\u0142adys\u0142aw szpilman , titled death of the city ( \u015amier\u0107 miasta ) , first published in 1946 . 
  szpilman , you know , the guy from [ * the pianist * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pianist_%282002_film%29 ) . 
  we do n't want them any * more * sadistic , believe me ... 
  fun fact : * fagot * is polish for bassoon ... 
  i did n't know the word bassoon once while talking about music so i told them about faggots ... 
  a 16yo with some serious self-esteem issues at that . 
  hang them all * because * we care . 
  ftfy , 
  by that he meant `` not the best relations '' with our neighbor , not that they 're gon na invade us , come on ... he 's the one who said that he fears germany 's inactivity more that its power , that germany is what powers europe today . 
  he 's far from being paranoid . 
  and frankly , knowing that he 's disillusioned about our relationship with the us is somewhat comforting . 
  people have been accusing him of being americans ' pawn and * blind * for quite some time now . 
  wiki to the rescue ( coz i 'm lazy ) :  these names literally mean `` bird 's milk '' or crop milk , a substance somewhat resembling milk , produced by certain birds to feed their young . 
  however , this is not origin of the name ; rather , ptasie mleczko is also a polish idiom meaning ** `` an unobtainable delicacy '' ** ( compare english : `` hen 's teeth '' ; also , a similar idiom can be found in bulgarian -- \u0442\u0443\u043a / \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430 , meaning `` even bird milk can be found here/there '' ) . 
   in poland , jan wedel , owner of the e. wedel company , developed the first ptasie mleczko in 1936 . 
  [ 3 ] wedel 's inspiration for the name of the confectionery came from his voyages to france , when he asked himself : `` what could bring greater happiness to a man who already has everything ? '', 
  then he thought : ** `` maybe only bird milk . '' ** . 
  hah ;d i love it when i open a thread with the intention to write a particular thing and there it is already , verbatim . 
  cheers !, 
   law and order lol :d i think you meant * law and justice *, 
   never used foreign towels i just went to see where my towels are from ... some say * kronborg of denmark * [ made in indonesia ... ] and the rest is * made in belgium * . 
  holy hell ... can not into domestic towels . 
  fun useless fact : just recently i spotted that my dog 's food was made in liechtenstein . 
  got probably a little overexcited ... 
  i mean ... * liechtenstein * ... how cool is that ? 
   british english * yeah * , about that ... our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  south african 3 . 
  scottish ( uk ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 .

  english ambivalent feelings ... 
  how did it start ? 
  well , some dude thought it 's a * brilliant idea * to impose catholicism on everyone and get them united . 
  he did as he thought . 
  lots of nasty wars with everyone around but somehow they always managed to bounce back . 
  one time , almost a thousand years after the * brilliant idea * , some not-so-nice guys also had an idea - not a new one - to annihilate the country completely . 
  you know what , * not a new one * is rather generous , that 's a goddamned clich\u00e9 . 
  but , not to be so repetitive , they came up with a reverse strategy . 
  if it did n't work with killing and burning things down , stealing clay and stuff , not even with eradicating the language , they chose to start from the other * end * and get a rid of said catholicism first . 
  such * immaterial * thing ca n't be attached * much * , right ? 
  why , of course it did * not * work . 
  just the other way around . 
  they safely secured it for centuries to come , and managed to produce a pope in the process . 
  you see , it appears , when you squeeze something too hard , weird things come out . 
  how will it end ? 
  with the * holy spirit * floating in nothingness , mumbling * not yet lost , kurwa . 
  but the scene in [ * red * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_%282010_film%29 ) where helen mirren 's character produces a bottle of sobieski vodka to clean bruce willis ' wound is * neat * . 
  totally agree . 
  i do n't think comparing herbal infused , meant to be distinctive , vodkas with a classic best neat is even doable . 
  let alone an appropriate thing to do . 
  but , here 's the thing , i 'm not a big drinker either . 
  and moreover , i 'm not a big fan of vodka ...  [ still polish , i swear ! ],
