  as in * classic * neat vodka where you can actually * taste * the thing . 
  i like herbal things like the ones i mentioned before [ gin included ] , or other rather distinctive like goldwasser which is practically not even vodka . 
  and the only time i had grey goose , a friend who treated me to it asked : * ... and ? 
  * [ fancy factor ] and i was like : * well , it 's vodka ... * so , you see , i 'm not gon na pretend i 'm any competent . 
  i ca n't even tell a difference between wheat grey goose and potato chopin ... 
  i can tell you i liked chopin better but that can be that voice in my head saying : * `` of course it has to be better , why , it 's a polish vodka and all 's fine in the universe . 
  the french should stick to wine/cognac/champagne , no ? 
  french vodka must be a blasphemy ;d '' * a hopeless case , sorry . 
  that being said , i thoroughly enjoy all books about all kinds of alcohol and * knowing * , * drinking * not so much . 
  i guess i must be a crypto-snob or somethnig . 
  apart from herbal things i 'm more of a * dry red * person . 
  again , i know what i like , but would n't dare to say what 's good in comparison . 
  if you like gin , i assume gin and tonic , you should try \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka with sprite and green cucumber . 
  that 's a nice thing . 
  also , the peppermint version of \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka is fun , but i have friends who think it 's hideous , so you 'll have to try for yourself . 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka with apple juice is a must . 
  try [ \u017bubr\u00f3wka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbubr%c3%b3wka ) and [ \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%b3dka_%c5%bbo%c5%82%c4%85dkowa_gorzka )  and that 's not even a joke , i think they 're the best ones . 
  you have no flair , you ca n't be trusted !, 
  how do we know you 're not an impostor ? 
  but that would turn out to be permanent too ... 
  oh , yay my sunday morning ... warm croissants and human trafficking go perfect together ... thanks . 
  we have slaves in poland ? 
  what did i miss ? 
  seriously though , what 's the criterium/definition here ? 
  that 's all germoney had in his pocket ... 
  burger any good ? 
  first of all , i did not make any * claims * , as i technically * asked * . 
  twice . 
  secondly , your first sentence basically says you agree with me , and since i know you do n't i 'm gon na call you on that one . 
  if you 're * skeptical * the majority * do n't * think , you 're basically saying you think they * do * . 
  and finally , you 're aware that * most * does leave room for * some * , right ? 
  51 % is already * most * . 
  you want me to back up my theory so here you go : the * most * popular party systems in the world are multi-party system , two-party system and single-party system . 
  a single-party system is typical for dictatorships - tiny elite and lots of unhappy people . 
  a two-party system is basically black or white while the prevailing is grey . 
  majority vote for the one that 's * closer * to them , not 100 % ideal . 
  some even vote not * for * one but against the other . 
  that leaves a lot of people to think on one time or another that `` their government is nuts '' . 
  [ the ones that did n't vote the particular government in , and the ones that did but do n't agree 100 % on every matter . ], 
  and in a multi-party system , which is the most popular one , hardly ever the absolute majority wins . 
  [ for example in poland the winning party usually has around 25 % . ], 
  so , as i said * most * and * majority * , not everybody , and * of the most * , not of every . 
  ** edit ** : grammar ** edit2 ** : sorry , i * did * write * every country in the world * in my first comment , now i see that . 
  but that was technically a question . 
  so , of course not * every * , but i still think it 's true for the * most * . 
  ** edit3 ** : actually , you wrote * most * . 
  so i replied to that . 
   also , you implied it 's true for most countries in the world . 
  and a giant middle finger to the paralympians . 
  good !, 
  you 're not most people , then . 
  i also do n't think my government is nuts , they 're rather dicks ... , 
  true , that would be the fan club . 
  all the more reason for its people to be pissed . 
  sure it is n't just one guy acting . 
  it 's a whole theater !, 
  and like in every performance there are screenwriters , actors , a whole bunch of other staff [ not to mention a lot of drama and some fancy special effects ] , but they all usually have to listen to one guy who pulls all the strings , and who has a final say in every matter - the director . 
  and that 's without a doubt putin . 
  the troops are doing what they 're told to , that 's nothing new . 
  and judging by what happens to those who dare to oppose and protest ( like recent protesters in moscow ) , even if some soldiers do n't agree , and have their own mind about the whole affair , they keep it to themselves . 
  as far as i know it does n't bode well for a soldier to question orders they 've been given . 
  add a little crazy , some skillful propaganda and you might even end up with a fanclub for putin . 
  i stumbled on terrific headline yesterday . 
  it said that over 78 % of russians support putin and his actions regarding the crimea . 
  they asked a representative sample of 1600 people in moscow . 
  moscow . 
  representative . 
  1600 * ... also , no , sorry , my previous comment was n't sarcastic . 
  not in the least . 
  you mean , do most people think their government is nuts ? 
  is n't that true for every country in the world ? 
  anyway , i feel sorry for all the regular russians . 
  the olympics were awesome , and sure as hell they are proud they pulled it off just fine , proved the world wrong and showed how great hosts they are . 
  and now the rest of the world is back to the * russia-the-bully * mental picture . 
  thanks , putin . 
  * only you ... *, 
  wrong brother , though, 
  hey , guess what !, 
  war in ukraine and war in sweden means we 're in the middle . 
  * again !, 
  it 's not about knowing the difference , it 's about a funny mistake . 
  and yeah , i do * read * the daily mail , especially when i 'm in need of some self-loathing or when my self-respect level is too high ... [ * them bloody imigrants !, 
  * or * what 's up with the kardashians ... * ] also , all those * lovely * comments !, 
  it 's comforting to know there are biased morons in other countries too ;d cheers !, 
   ( when poland got out of ussr ) we were never * in * to begin with . 
  i 'm sorry but i just * had to * point that out , a pole must n't make such mistake . 
  and while i 'm sure you know that , and here it 's just a matter of wording , there are people who seriously think poland was a part of the ussr and we do n't need to contribute to that view . 
  especially not in / r/europe . 
  respect 2 . 
  seek 5 . 
  consult not really , they basically said that they wo n't be a bully , not that they 'll do something if someone else is . ^ 1 russia is selling a story right now that they are basically helping ukraine , keeping integrity and preventing bloodshed ... even though they 've just broken the first three points . 
  so unless there 's a nuclear attack , no one will do a thing , apart of * consulting * , of course ... ^ 1 i 've read on / r/worldnews that the budapest memorandum was n't ratified by the us senate and is basically unenforceable, 
  i was just raping google , trying to find it , to no avail . 
   there was another one by cnn or bbc where they put poland in place of germany . 
  ca n't find that one either . 
  well , if you think of it ... just drop [ some ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitaya ) into a glass . 
  version for [ the brave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snake_wine ) . 
  add one of [ these ] ( http://us.123rf.com/450wm/dontree/dontree1207/dontree120700076/14366410-yellow-drinking-straws-for-party.jpg ) ;d version for the lazy : you need one of [ these ] ( http://www.etsy.com/listing/170842870/set-3-vintage-highball-glasses-yellow ) , and one of [ these ] ( http://us.123rf.com/450wm/dontree/dontree1207/dontree120700076/14366410-yellow-drinking-straws-for-party.jpg ) , some cura\u00e7ao , * et voil\u00e0 !, 
  norway , why are you hiding behind belgium 's flag ? 
  oh , come on !,
