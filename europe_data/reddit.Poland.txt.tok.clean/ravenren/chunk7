  we love them , they 're so funny !, 
  yep , i 'll have fries with that ... , 
  actually , there are n't any official rankings . 
  the international olympic committe does not have an official ranking because :  * `` the olympic games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries . '' * and , by the way , the one marked * official * there :  1 . russia 2 . norway 3 . canada 4 . united states ** 14 ** . sweden wtf ? 
  that 's not fair !, 
  we 're the 11th !, 
  those damn tables only show the first 10 ... :(, 
   wait half a year and pay for yourself !, 
  sounds familiar ... 
  on the same basis we share emilia plater . 
  her family was of lithuanian descent but polonized , and we think of her as one of our own - in the sense of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , like you said . 
  and the belarusians also name her and ko\u015bciuszko as their national heroes . 
  that 's some serious stretch . 
  the 18th/19th century emigration was unique for variety of reasons , and their increased activity was as exceptional as was their aim . 
  to keep alive the non-existing country and bring it back to life fully when opportunity presents itself . 
  you ca n't really measure them and their importance by the same methods you 'd use for today diaspora . 
  and i 've never met a pole who thought of them as diaspora in today 's meaning of the word . 
  those were the people who 'd have been in the center of events , had n't it been dangerous for them . 
  the political refugees forced to emigrate for their deeds and/or the ones who chose the life in exile to be able to actually do something . 
  the [ hotel lambert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b4tel_lambert#the_political_salon ) comes to mind . 
  [ and to some extend the government in exile during and after wwii . ], 
  ko\u015bciuszko and pu\u0142awski are n't seen as emigrants here , and for sure they 're not considered something that * america gave to us * ... it 's totally the other way around . 
  and a source of pride at that . 
  besides , we 're not talking about the 18th century heroes here . 
  just regular present-day people and the american polonia are mostly the ones considered so out of touch they look like poland 20 years ago . 
  in their political views , in showing their * polishness * , musical taste judging by visting polish artists , and the belief how poland looks today ... not to offend anyone but en masse the american polonia is perceived by * polish poles * as they themselves are by americans . 
  one huge stereotype . 
  not favorable in the least . 
  and , what 's important , when talking about the american polonia we generally have in mind at least the second generation americans , more often the third or more . 
  and majority do n't really bother to visit to see how 's poland today . 
  that 's why they 're mostly out of touch . 
  for comparison the poles in uk are either the first generation from the last decade or the second/third from after the wwii but they tend to be more in touch and more willing to visit , i.e. 
  there 's no atlantic in the way . 
  *** personally , i think that people who left the country for good and have been abroad for five years and longer , and have no intention to go back , should n't have the right to vote in polish elections . 
  and god forbid the second generation with their newly acquired passports ... their vision of poland is long time gone and they 're making decisions about here and now while they 're not even here , nor have they any idea what 's going on here , and especially not * now * . 
  i 've seen once a post-election interview with some random polish american , and when asked why she voted the way she did [ far-right ] she responded that * `` it 's so nice poland 's so religious and so traditional , and we have to keep the values alive in the world while america is heading in the wrong direction '' * ... so , * hell yeah * , let 's make poland a * skansen * but she 'd rather stay in the states ... 
  i learned an hour ago . 
  been speechless since . 
  [ * sigh * ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/danish-zoo-outrage-giraffe-marius ) . 
  i do n't mind people do n't speak polish . 
  let 's be honest - it 's useless outside of poland and probably too much of a trouble to learn it just for fun . 
  unless you have some serious motivation - a heritage , the desire to move over here , a spouse , you 're probably screwed . 
  what i do mind is that almost everyone , i 'm not even exaggerating , * everyone * knows * kurwa * and * w\u00f3dka * . 
  it 's a shame , i 'd rather they knew nothing at all . 
  edit : a letter, 
  yes , exactly , that 's why i mentioned the * original * inhabitants , or at least the first ones we know of . 
  i thought he was being ironic but now i 'm kinda at a loss ... 
  you think that 's excessive ? 
  we had a politician who demanded of spain to [ pay back a loan ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9449896/polish-mp-demands-spain-pays-back-16th-century-debt.html ) from the 16th century . 
  in gold . 
  no , if anything , it should belong to the baltics as it had belonged to the balts before the germans took over . 
  you forgot gays . 
  ** edit : ** * really ? 
  * i reply to someone who told me to fuck myself and i need to mark the irony for you , dear redditors ? 
  i 'll translate it for those of you who do n't read between the lines : when they 're bad , they 're bad , ie . 
  ukraine , chechnya , the ani-gay laws . 
  but give them some credit where credit is due . 
  it 's the olympics , it 's about sport and fun , not politics . 
  ever heard about the olympic truce ? 
  the polish media wo n't shut up about russian * setbacks * during the opening , they constantly try to add/find / * create * new ones . 
  my favorite list so far contains : * ** the poor [ fifth ring ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yvtj8jh.jpg ) ** [ does n't matter that things happen to malfunction all the time all over the world , when it 's a russian ring , it 's * a grave mistake * and offense and ... * wait * ... ] * ** the poor austrian contestant who [ fell ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/07/austrian-athlete-fall-olympics-sochi_n_4748968.html ) during the parade ** [ idek ... is putin a witch and cast a spell on his legs ? 
  * what ? 
  * ] * ** the glorious [ kaliningrad of poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jlictsr.jpg ) ** [ we loved this one !, 
  also , who remembers when our tv [ broadcasted ] ( http://www.fakt.pl/tvp-pomylila-flage-rosji-z-zsrr-wyrzuca-technika-przez-pomylke-flag-rosji-i-zsrr-,artykuly,163182,1.html ) the soviet flag instead of the russian one during the euro 2012 ? 
  * exactly ... * ] they 're trying so hard to diminish it , it 'd be funny if it was n't so stupid . 
  i did n't really pay attention to the first day of the games but i loved the opening . 
  it was imho better than london 's and i liked the latter very much . 
  the old prussians were n't germans by any means , they were balts , the germans [ the teutonic order ] were asked to help christianize the pagan tribes , and they kinda got comfy ... there 's one [ polish duke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_of_masovia#teutonic_order ) from the 13th century who [ takes the heat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_of_masovia#konrad.27s_legacy ) for this to this day ... 
  * no , no , no * , you do n't put bottles * on * the table , that 's * uncultured * !, 
  you keep them * next * to the table , you know , where you can easily reach them ... ;d and look on the practical side , less likely that someone will knock over the bottle and spoil the precious ... * ok * , i think you get the idea !, 
  seriously , though , i 've never seen a bottle of vodka on the table , unless it was the only thing that was consumed , or the * main dish * . 
  and , at least in my family , alcohol never makes an appearance until hours after the main meal , somewhere around the third dessert or so . 
  and the times when i encountered five of them simultaneously were all weddings . 
  ** edit ** : take that back , i 've seen plenty of bottles on the tables on my [ * studni\u00f3wka * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/studni%c3%b3wka ) , that 's scientifically interesting because there was supposed to be no alcohol and no one knew how it got there ... 
  i 'd vote for * pochlast * or * przychlast * ; , 
  hey , moldova !, 
  from the looks of your table , looks like we 're cousins !, 
  * er . . * i meant plural * j *  that 's why * j * is in italics and s is not , see ? 
  * yeah ... * well , i thought it 's a good idea . 
  * szcz * are just two sounds , it only looks that way to scare unsuspecting foreigners :d it 's like this : * fre **** sh ch **** erry * but together . 
  * hey * , cnn [ i think ] gave us once the french-polish border and evaporated germany in the process . 
  that was fun !, 
  to be honest , that 's exactly how dutch looks to me . 
  you really like * j * s , do n't you ? 
  mine was very positive ... and then i learned they do n't like us . 
  now i 'm somewhat less enthusiastic , but still , 
  a little early to make such judgment , do n't you think ? 
   a village here , two meters there * oh * , sweet portugal and your little problems :d, 
   that 's not much , you pay almost as much as we do but you earn 3 times as more than we do . 
  that 's what we say to the germans . 
   with only one neighbor you like your border ? 
  you know , the oldest one in europe that has n't been changed since ... what century ? 
  center means you ca n't leave the party even if you 'd like to . 
  you mean great people and great food ? 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  * yeah * , i was gon na say i hope i 'll stay in the guessing sphere . 
   i wish there were more people who could say that . 
  * sigh . 
  there 's hope that people do . 
  exactly .
