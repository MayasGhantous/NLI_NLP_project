  i had kinda d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment , even though a minute ago i had no idea dublin was ruined so much at any point in recent history . 
  few days ago i rummaged through [ those ] ( http://fundir.org/gallery,wroclaw_1945_zniszczenia,5140,0,0.html ) of wroc\u0142aw in 1945 . 
  # 16,17,18 look like they could 've been twins with dublin . 
  striking . 
  i guess war always looks the same . 
  is it just me or did they really cover * every * european country sans us ? 
   polish women are warned during the patrols about the `` threats '' of getting involved with muslim men as a polish woman , if they came and * warned * me , i 'd feel really threatened . 
  * by them * . 
  that 's one thing . 
  another is , i 'm curious if they realize how much of a resemblence it bears to * those muslims * telling * their * women what to do , whom they 're * allowed to * meet with and so on ... purely hypothetically : if i went to the club with a muslim , or * muslim looking * , guy i 'd be more worried that those defenders are gon na hurt me , as a * disgrace * to the `` polish women '' and/or my friend . 
  i ca n't shed a feeling that all the *** far *** - * whichever-side * followers , be they muslim , catholic , jewish , atheist , whatever religion or ideology ... are just * anti-brain * . 
  that 's the common trait they share . 
  lose the * far - * part and suddenly world 's a better place and you do n't feel like everyone is out there to get you . 
  and of course i do realize that there are * bad people * who enjoy doing * bad things * ... we have police for that . 
  police that should n't , * must n't * , be prejudiced whether you 're muslim or * green with purple dots on your forehead * , but that 's another story ... one more thing , the way they use the phrase * `` polish women '' * makes it feel derogatory . 
  or maybe that 's just me . 
  i do n't have a problem with sharing . 
  * even * chopin . 
  he 's a common good !, 
  i do have a problem with double standard , though . 
  polish  france = french french  poland = still french see ? 
  not cool . 
  but i think you may be right that it 's just a discrepancy of definitions . 
  i think the poles draw the main line between nationality [ what you feel ] and citizenship [ what 's on paper ] because for over a century what they felt was the only thing they 've had . 
  and we , the successors , are somehow skewed still . 
  and probably a little insecure that someone 's gon na try and take from us whatever little we have . 
  and all what we have is also what we share : chopin , curie , copernicus , ko\u015bciuszko , even our national poet - mickiewicz [ * `` lithuania , my country ... '' * ] they all have ties to different countries , and understandably so . 
  a little double standard here and there , and suddenly nobody 's polish ... see my point ? 
  as to chopin - we * do * know what he felt , he stated that on multiple occasions , so the poles who make priority of a * feeling * wo n't take chopin any other than polish - it just does n't make sense for us . 
  but , * hey * , we do like to share !, 
  we just want a little credit where credit is due . 
  there 's one quote about chopin , by cyprian kamil norwid , that i like very much : * `` rodem warszawianin , sercem polak a talentem \u015bwiata obywatel '' * [ a varsovian by birth , a pole by heart and the world 's citizen by his talent ] . 
   let 's just listen to him without quarelling over his grave . 
  if i were in a bad mood i 'd say : you 've got his grave , let us have a quarrel ...  also , i love [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-2anwr-6je ) , 
   non-western-europe europe no need , you 're already a cuteness master !, 
  and skilled in diplomacy , i see . 
  they 're gon na love you !, 
  you can be cute together !, 
  * d'aww . 
  you should hear the czechs , comparing to them we 're just amateurs . 
  they 're adorable :3, 
   for spacecraft so ... polan ' * can * into space after all . 
  you ruined the chain :( boo . 
  that 's really cute . 
  i guess they all are * correct * if you mean * latin alphabet * . 
  in one language or another . 
  but * hey * , look what i found on [ wiki ] ( https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_janukovy%c4%8d ) in * lingua latina * . 
  that 's a little weird creation - * \u010d * in latin ? 
  and here i bet on * - us * ending . 
   janoekovitsj is that how you spell * janukowicz * in dutch ? 
  looks cool . 
  ever heard about the [ h\u00f4tel lambert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b4tel_lambert#the_political_salon ) ? 
  half of the * important * poles of the 19th century emigrated to france , the other half elsewhere . 
  that 's the only way it was safe . 
  to be able to * do something * for poland and not getting killed in the process was kinda priority . 
  chopin also acquired french citizenship , so did many others , but somehow he wished his heart to be returned to poland after his death , and during wwii germans banned his music from being broadcasted by radio . 
  guess what , they found it * too polish * . 
  this * french citizen * did good , apparently . 
  ** edit : ** oh , and according to your logic this [ i 'm just using chopin as a clear example ] : '' * chopin 's father , nicolas chopin , was a frenchman from lorraine who had * *** emigrated *** * to poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen . 
  * '' [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_chopin#childhood ) should have erased * the frenchness * but somehow it only works one way when you ask a frenchman , and it usually favors * the fancier * side . 
  * huh . 
  also , this : * '' [ micha\u0142 s\u0119dziw\u00f3j ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micha%c5%82_s%c4%99dziw%c3%b3j ) ( michael sendivogius , s\u0119dzimir ) ( 1566 -- 1636 ) of ostoja coat of arms was a polish alchemist , philosopher , and medical doctor . 
  a pioneer of chemistry , he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids , metals and other chemical compounds . 
  * *** he discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen 170 years before similar discoveries by scheele and priestley . 
  *** '' so , sweden , france and uk - make room , here i come !, 
  i 've read somewhere that she regretted she had named that exact element polonium because it 's mostly useless ... unless you 're planning a murder , radium on the other hand ... 
  i 've been planning to turn that story into my debut with * a certain comic * [ * ah * , you know , little p. greatest discovery named for the eternal glory and ... * nothing * . 
  bonus points if someone turns that against him . 
  * cough * murder * cough * . 
  a little schadenfreude ca n't hurt , yeah ? 
  :d ] but i 'm too lazy and lack a skill probably , so if someone finds that idea worth anything , be my guest . 
   some kind of ... spear ? 
  [ the lance of saint maurice ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82%c3%b3cznia_%c5%9awi%c4%99tego_maurycego ) - that 's the only spear [ s ] in history that i recall . 
  apparently , there were a few copies [ ours , czech 's , hungarian 's ] , the original one [ german 's ] was supposed to contain a nail from the cross christ was crucified on , and they all were supposed to be somehow connected with [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_lance ) . 
  i 'm too lazy to get my facts straight right now . 
  i remember something but i do n't know what ... 
  so , if someone 's bored , be my guest . 
  [ \u015awi\u0119ty wojciech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adalbert_of_prague ) !, 
  also , [ dobrawa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobrawa_of_bohemia ) . 
  man , i 've seen +12 c , it was a bliss . 
  it 's -10 c now ... 
  in case i have n't been clear enough , i 'm not following it either , so i do n't know what you 're missing , but knowing them i think it 's still safe to say it 's not much . 
  and probably for the best that you do n't expose your brain to that ... 
  i read headlines sometimes ... 
  soo , our * dear church * is trying to make money in an immoral way ... how 's that news ? 
  but , * hey * , yesterday i stumbled on an article which stated that niesio\u0142owski was trying to insult meryl streep . 
  the only reason that caught my attention was this incompatibility and curiosity that followed - how such a low form of life as he is would even try to successfully insult someone like her ... but no surprises there . 
  but it was nice to see onet.pl users agree on something for a change . 
  the only remotely reasonable point that he had made drowned in the endless sea of his stupidity . 
  together with his manners , i 'd say . 
  north ** pole ** winter finally found its way . 
  and guess what ... it was three months late and still everyone got surprised : * `` look !, 
  it 's snowing !, 
  '' , `` why is it so cold ?!, 
  '' , '' ... is that ice ? 
  '' * etc. 
  in january . 
  * sigh * . 
  personally , i was rooting for spring already . 
  just * a little * disappointed .
