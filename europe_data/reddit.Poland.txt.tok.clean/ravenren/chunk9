  really sorry , i did n't notice anything else about last week . 
  * them snowflakes are fascinating ... *, 
  well , we 'd like to trust them but ... 
  what i like the most about this video is that the people just do n't give a shit and carry on with their lives . 
  they want a change for the better , you ca n't actually blame them for that . 
  this is just scary . 
  i 'm legitimately worried that if our government fail to finally start to listen to the people , something like this will happen in poland too . 
   inspired by many sources q : how exactly do you get inspired by something that you learn * after * the fact ? 
  a : you do n't . 
  his true and first inspiration was the instrument called * claviolin * built by jan jarmusiewicz , he loved the idea and then discovered da vinci 's project , when he decided to build it he learned about haiden . 
   when i came across father jarmusiewicz 's claviolin , i started intensive research and soon found some historical materials which were absolutely sensational for me . 
  i realised that this instrument had been invented , named `` viola organista '' and sketched by leonardo da vinci himself !, 
  ( ... ) over time , i discovered that the first ever maker of viola organistas , then called the geigenwerk , was hans haiden , an artisan from nuremberg . 
  sources give various numbers of the instruments he built ; some say he made as many as 32 instruments , but in fact only two are documented : the first from 1570 and a revised model from 1600 . 
  none of them has survived . 
  and then :  a description of haiden 's instrument with its sound characteristics and musical properties is contained in syntagma musicum by michael praetorius , published in 1618 . 
  once i 'd read it , i was enchanted . 
  the instrument promised to be a revelation , it was universal , combining the best features of various types of instruments : it produced a continuous sound like an organ , it had the sound of bowed string instruments , and you could play vibrato on it . 
  it was a unique synthesis of harpsichord , positive organ and bowed string instruments . 
  in a typical baroque manner , praetorius wrote that it could play urban music , rural music , it could express various feelings , and even imitate the sound of a drunken man . 
  i then realised that this was a unique situation : i would be able to play a repertoire which is practically unavailable to a pianist -- the works of the great literature for viola da gamba [ the viola da gamba was the predecessor of the cello -- ed . ] . 
  he was * encouraged * by praetorius ' description of haiden 's instrument that had the same qualities that this of leonardo 's project . 
  but he had decided to build it before he even knew about haiden . 
   the only surviving instrument was made in 1625 , on the model of haiden 's viola , by a spanish craftsman , raymundo truchado . 
  it is preserved in the musical instrument museum in brussels . 
  ** have you seen it ? 
  ** yes , i have examined it in detail and made many photos of it . 
  in a way i did it illegally , because i crossed the barriers separating the exhibit from the visitors . 
  i did n't like this instrument at all . 
  to put it bluntly -- it 's ugly . 
  not much of an inspiration , * huh * ? 
  here : http://tygodnik.onet.pl/zmysly/the-da-vinci-tone-in-english/qw5s9, 
  did you also read the comments beneath ? 
  let me quote :  anonymous2 says november 19 , 2013 at 5:50 pm in the youtube video zubrzycki mentions both praetorius and heiden and is familiar with the various german terms , but it seems that the first spark that ignited his imagination were da vinci 's drawings and description and that he discovered those sources later on . 
  i did n't get the impression that his was supposed to be replica of an early 16th century instrument , certainly not with that range and design . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gorn_z9m9lu ( english subtitles are available ) . 
   in the morning of 19 february workers got to the last area of the hall that was still covered by fragments of the hall 's collapsed roof . 
  they found no more victims but found two pigeons that were still alive after spending 22 days trapped under the rubble . 
  i remember a story of a newborn baby that survived a whole week under the rubble after an earthquake , if i recall correctly . 
  it was all over the news * last year ** ? 
  * , i think . 
  anyway , my point - miracles do happen sometimes and hope always dies last . 
  well , when we skip the geopolitic divide that no longer makes sense and stick to the * geo * part ... most people tend to underestimate how much of russia actually fits into europe . 
  look at [ this map ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm ) . 
  pretend you do n't have any preconceptions about it , and slovakia does n't look so eastern anymore , nor does poland ; finland that majority would probably , along with scandinavia , put into * the west * is further east than the czech republic , funny , * huh * ? 
   i 'm just saying . 
  we 're * keen on getting rid of the east/west stereotype * but not really . 
  anyway , my main point was that / u/hadok failed to notice that there are * eastern * countries with * western * currency , latvia is going to join them on january 1st , and that this mysterious * east * still treated as some homogeneous being is not one entity nor should it be much of a mystery anymore ...  i 'm sure malta is laughing at us right now anyway . 
  probably . 
   ** edit : ** as an afterthought , you wo n't deny that people commonly use northern & southern europe along with western & eastern , so i think it 's only fair to bring central for those who do n't really fit in either of these . 
  take poland - comparing to germany , not quite western but comparing to ukraine , not really eastern , not southern for sure , and on the wrong side of the baltic to be considered northern . 
  that leaves one option . 
  lots of pictures , not much else . 
  ** edit ** : actually , here , see for yourself :  europe 's disappearing borders by valerio vincenzo political and economic agreements have brought borders down across the continent since the signing of the schengen agreements in 1985 , the borders of most of the european continent have been erased little by little from the landscape and from people 's imagination . 
  the agreements are a giant leap in the progressive unification of europe and the emergence of a european consciousness . 
  today , with 26 countries belonging to the schengen area , 16,500 km of borders can be freely crossed . 
  the award of the nobel peace prize to the european union has ratified the historical importance of this almost imperceptible but radical change in europe . 
  since 2007 , with the help of a gps navigation device and detailed maps , i have conducted eight trips along these erased borderlines . 
  i calculated that i crossed the borders more than a thousand times without having to show my papers . 
  even if these pictures have been taken thousands of kilometres apart , they all provide an image that is far from the stereotype we tend to associate with the notion of a border .

  there 's the whole [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tripoint ) about tripoints on wiki but their photos suck .

   and eastern europe . 
  * ekhem * , slovakia and estonia also use the euro , and probably neither would be glad with * eastern * label . 
  slovakia is central , and proud i bet . 
  estonia wants into nordic !, 
  i bet in the long term it will pay off , just look at the kids . 
  and it will turn out that helping them was actually cheaper than trying to get a rid of them ... and they actually are working , what else do you want ? 
  that 's an axiom .

  holy moly !, 
  i do n't even know where to start ... 
  i 'll try to keep it * short ? 
  * play [ * pollyanna * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollyanna ) ... and purposely completely ignore * various * events . 
  *  so * rossija big * . 
  in every sense of the word ... take that back . 
  * rossija biggest * . 
  and relevant [ see , i 'm nice ] . 
  and diverse . 
  and so different yet so familiar . 
  the slavic brother but love is rather tough . 
  i 've been told that the opposite of love is n't hatred but indifference ; that love and hatred are closely related . 
  i think that pretty much sums up our relationship [ there 's someting freudian about it ... ] we kind of hate each other but not really , regular people tend to get along pretty well . 
  there 's a ridiculous amount of things we have in common , many of them edible , and probably twice as many opinions of what unites , what divides - those tend to be the same things . 
  we love to argue . 
  if you happen to be a politician it 's your damn obligation to argue . 
  things got violent at times , well , last time on monday , tradition 's live and kicking . 
  there 's one thing we sure have in common : a lot of idiots . 
  those full of themselves tend to be in charge ; on both sides . 
  but who cares . 
  there 's a lot of them so they have someone good in probably every field but their volleyball team used to piss me off the most ... usually around 4 am while watching a game when i supposed to be asleep . 
  they 're a federation .
