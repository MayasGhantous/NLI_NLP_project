caste was almost completely rebuilt in 1826 so i do n't think of it as of something special/famous, 
  lublin , poland : cebularz - wheat pie with onions and poppy, 
  from this browser , not necessarily in that location ( if it 's mobile ), 
  from cache . 
  come on , it 's fox news . 
  i 'm surprised that they do not show `` europe '' as a country . 
  i completely do n't understand replacing sikorski with schetyna . 
  sikorski was a good fm and schetyna does n't speak any foreign language . 
  even if sikorski will get marshal of the sejm chair , it 'll be a waste of his potential . 
  edit : after a little of thinking : if sikorski is going for the presidential chair , it 's a smart move . 
  [ my post about lithuania from 11 months * ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1m8o2m/how_it_should_be_poland_and_lithuania/cc7zg6k ), 
  dude , the french gave the world an art of oral sex with their open-mindedness . 
  who would hate france after getting a blowjob ? 
  remember that this study is from february . 
  that was the euromaidan time and it 's hard to say `` i like ukrainians '' or `` i dislike ukrainians '' where there are clearly two sides fighting each other in a domestic war over there ... 
  i think that most of poles still treat czech republic and slovakia as czechoslovakia . 
  you 're just ... very similar to us . 
  and i 'm saying this as a person who has spent a few vacations in both czech rep. ( climbed many mountains in krkono\u0161e ) and slovakia ( climbed up po\u013esk\u00fd hrebe\u0148 ajd rysy vrch from poprad ) . 
  and jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein and knedl\u00edky !, 
  it 's a name of a ~ ~ small town ~ ~ village * with gypsy settlement near by . 
   we share marie curie/maria sk\u0142odowska let 's agree on marie sk\u0142odowska-curie . 
  she never lost her polishness and taught her daughters polish language when living in france . 
  also , she herself was using both names . 
  i 'm still amused by the name of university in my city , '' [ maria curie-sk\u0142odowska university ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_curie-sk%c5%82odowska_university ) '' though ...  fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric chopin/fryderyk szopen a few years back , szopena st. in lublin , pl had a plate saying `` szopena '' on one end and `` chopina '' on the other one . 
  ( - a = 's in this case ), 
  i actually know 2 people who just love the taste of cold ( good ) vodka . 
  they can sit at the table with a glass of vodka and drink it with little sips . 
  cheap vacation place . 
  trying to be cautious , trying not to mention anyone ... 
  i 'll just watch south park . 
  a random episode . 
  polish president and polish minister of national defence . 
  which one is the `` polish guy '' ? 
  polish high five : < 5 , 
   elected kaisers dude . 
  the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't exist . 
  yeah , it 's [ hard to get into canda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vqcfj_11ea ) . 
  poland polish national health fund ( narodowy fundusz zdrowia ) said that the hospital which declined an abortion and declined an information about other clinic to a woman with damaged pregnancy have to pay 70k pln penalty ( to said nhf , not to the mother ) . 
  hospital is funded by nfz ( like all or most polish public hospitals ) . 
  the child was born a few days ago with one eye out , without half of the head , and brains literally out . 
  now catholic priests ( like archbishop marek j\u0119draszewski ) started asking people during masses to to give the money to the church , so it can cover hospital 's penalty . 
  nothing about raising money for the child , of course . 
  hospital 's chief ( prof. bogdan chazan ) who himself denied abortion to this woman and prolonged examinations just to get to the date when pregnancy ca n't be removed by law ... is now some kind of a hero for polish catholics and far-right politicians ( like ryszard czarnecki , who comped pro-abortion people to hitler and stalin on tv ) . 
  another gynecologyst , prof. romuald d\u0119bski described this child as : '' * this is a child who does not have half of the head , has a brain outside , a hanging eyeball , has the whole face clefted , no brain inside . 
  it will be dying thanks to prof. chazan for the next month or two because it has a healthy heart and healthy lungs . 
  it will be dying , and eventually die because of some infection . * '' . 
  pictures were said to be too gore to be shown on tv .

  [ how is it not ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpbx47zsktc ), 
   sikorksi is a # $ % $ idiot ( ... ) ( i lived in the u.s. ) ( ... ) please do n't judge poland based on one idiot 's remarks . 
  i 'd like to use your post to ask other people not to judge poland on some man 's ( without calling names ) theory that he is able to talk for every pole just because he has some practical ability to compare two different approches to one lifestyle . 
   his views/opinions of usa are not shared by the majority of poles . 
  yes , they are . 
   he is a politician , and politicians are not the brightest people . 
  polish people have some really racist sayings ( like `` sto lat za murzynami '' - `` we are a hundred years before the blacks '' or `` a hundred years after the blacks did it '' meaning something was done not as fast/well as it should based on the current popular knowledge of the subject in case . 
  this is in fact ** very ** racist , but it is not really racist per se ... it came into the existance when a black men or women on polish streets were so rare that they were an objects of pointed fingers and people saying `` look , look , a ** real ** black person !!! '', 
  `` sto lat za murzynami '' really means that someone has had a time to learn and improve , but he did n't . 
  `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' ( being black , mentally ) means here something else that it does in france or in the u.s. - `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' or `` blackness '' are slur not for black people , but for skulks . 
   the only thing poland will get for sucking america 's dick is a fat dick in its mouth . 
  might be true , yet it 's still ** only ** in the mouth with the u.s. 
  why ca n't you ? 
  that 's a really reasonable point of view , which most of poles share . 
  the new york times [ wrote recently ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/opinion/wergin-europes-man-in-warsaw.html ) that sikorski should have a good chair , but it was n't a chair in poland . 
  as for poland - better relationships with neighbors are not certainly better than a booty-call-like relationship with the u.s. not counting the nato or the eu in , we all saw what neighbors can and ca n't provide to someone in need very recently and very close to the nato border . 
  sikorski just knows what 's a lesser evil and reasonably goes this path and he 's not lying to himself that relations with the u.s. are the best thing that could ever happen to poland . 
  if the leaks concerning mr. sikorski from tomorrow-released tapes are as ` strong ' as they are - the guy have nothing to worry about . 
   its too bad he only says this privately and in public does something else . 
  how do you imagine foreign minister of any country speaking such things in public ? 
  yet polish voters are not really sikorski 's target . 
  [ jerry mateparae ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerry_mateparae ), 
   the us is there but not really helping obama seems helpful . 
  polish people are also calling * russian churches * `` cerkiew '' , as it 's a temple of eastern christianism ; there are both `` ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 '' and `` cerkiew '' in polish language and they are just for different relligions ' buildings . 
  i guess some people , [ like me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fxsnxey.png ) are not counted in . 
  i have many adsites and statsites blocked . 
  haha , same here . 
  scorch , prince of persia , sokoban and lemmings . 
  it was a huge step forward from playing with [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvkn3bz.jpg ), 
  my thought when i saw that poland was waay more yellow than germany . 
  but yellow is also for `` slavic '' . 
  i guess that hitler was n't really successful with creating/expanding his pure aryan race . 
   now i 'm sad that english name for poland is n't `` scorchedlandia '' or sth like that . 
  would be cool . 
  brings memories of the pre-worms [ `` scorch '' game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4uxjdtm.png ), 
  just out of curiosity ( i 'm not in the mood to read documents on this ) - are ue countries allowed to have open borders with countries other than of schengen agreement ? 
  i can not understand this polish-lithuanian hate , which everyone is pointing out in comments here . 
  i live in eastern poland and i have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about lithuanians , ukrainians , or belarusians ( except for some elderly people , remembering second ( and even first ) ww , connecting these countries to cccp ) . 
  also , i have been in vilnius once and i have none but the great memories about this trip and people i randomly met and got drunk with  also , second * boyfriend * of my grandma ( guy who lived with her years after her husband and my grandpa whom i have n't ever met , died ) was lithuanian and he was a mathematician at university in my city . 
  ** best fucking man i have ever met in my life . 
  ** even that he was ~ 60 years older than me , he taught me how to beat hangover with vodka without getting drunk again and so my parent 's would n't see ; he did magic spending hours of hours with me , teaching me math so i could go by highschool . 
  i was terrible with science subjects and great with humanistics , which i hated ... now , for over 10 years , i work in it . 
  in environment that i loved but i would n't ever get here if not for him . 
  ** i love lithuania !, 
  sadly you can be assured that this will change if [ pis ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/prawo_i_sprawiedliwo%c5%9b%c4%87 ) will be again running the government . 
  they truly hate germans and seem to have no desire to unite poland with most european countries . 
  they 've chased the guy from lubart\u00f3w to lublin .
