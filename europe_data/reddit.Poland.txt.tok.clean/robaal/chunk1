... that unrealistic phoneblocks video ... google is trying to realize the modular phone idea [ ( wiki ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_ara ) . 
  they [ presented ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0he3jr-fzh0 ) a not-quite-working prototype in june . 
  afaik the drivers are neither employees of uber , nor necessarily full-time drivers . 
  i think the argument is that it is more like if you 're planning on driving somewhere and you look for passengers to split the gas costs . 
  the guys that storm the building look pretty much the same as the ` polite men ' from crimea . 
  some cargo ships take passengers : [ link ] ( http://www.cma-cgm-blog.com/cargo-cruises-travel-shipping-cargo/ ) . 
  i 've researched it some time ago . 
  it costs ~ 100eur per person per day , and a eu/us trip would take at least a week . 
  that tank prototype [ looks pretty cool ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 ) . 
  i love the commenters with non-russian names repeating the views that only pro-kremlin russian media share . 
  press release from the committee : [ link ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2ftext%2bim-press%2b20140318ipr39210%2b0%2bdoc%2bxml%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en ) it looks like they 've kept not only the ` special services ' parts , but also the ` isps can filter your traffic ' parts . 
  i assume the details of the vote will be available here : [ link ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2013/0309%28cod%29&amp;l=en ), 
  dammit , sorry for the misleading title . 
  this was a vote on a report of the leading committee . 
  the parliament itself will debate the `` telecoms '' package on 2nd of april and vote on it the next day . 
  fuck conscription . 
  if you want to play soldier then volunteer . 
  there 's also a breakdown of the proposal and the anti-neutrality points at [ savetheinternet.eu ] ( http://www.savetheinternet.eu/ ) . 
  so there is a violence against women problem in eu . 
  it needs to be addressed . 
  this is n't about culture . 
  this is n't about ` eu is n't as bad as whatever-else ' . 
  this is about one of your friends or family being vulnerable and having no support to defend themselves . 
  it 's about the attackers not being brought to justice , because victims are too weak to report the crime . 
  it sure as fuck should n't be swept under the rug because ` men get into fights too ' . 
   one in 20 has been raped  * one in 20 has been raped *  ** one in 20 has been raped **, 
  that article says that eu rejected a proposal to involve russia in the eu-ukraine trade deal negotiations . 
  it does n't say anything about eu restricting ukraine from signing a trade deal with russia . 
  thanks , that was a really good read . 
  the pork ban is due to african swine fever being found among wild boars . 
  here 's a [ related article ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/poland-china-russia.u46 ) about china banning pork imports as well . 
  yanukovych replaced the head of the armed forces a few days ago . 
  there were also some talk of an ` anti-terrorist operation ' that the army is legally allowed to be involved in . 
  looks like they used [ whole canton populations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantons_of_switzerland#list ) . 
  i do n't think so . 
  there are [ some ] ( https://www.coursera.org/course/friendsmoneybytes ) old courses that are still open , but not all . 
  you can join any of their currently running courses to see how the site works . 
  every week , the instructor will publish some videos and a quiz . 
  each video may have some embedded questions . 
  the programming course i did also had practice problems , and quizzes referred to their solutions . 
  if you do n't care about the symbolic ` grading ' then you can watch the videos and do the quizzes any time you want . 
  you do n't even need to do the quizzes , but they are helpful in finding any holes in your understanding . 
  there are also course forums . 
  because coursera tries to ` synchronize ' students , the newest topics tend to be current , with people talking about the same material . 
  i 'd recommend keeping up with the release schedule , as otherwise it 's easy to lose interest . 
  germany does n't seem much sunnier , and they are getting a significant portion of their energy from solar . 
  i think it 's reporting the resolution incorrectly for ff . 
  under linux , i can get it to report the correct resolution by disabling window borders , but it 's not like they are visible in fullscreen . 
  running some more tests , the difference between ff and chrome is smaller than the last time i looked . 
  iirc [ html5 openttd ] ( http://play-ttd.com/performance-test/ ) used to be a slideshow in ff , and now i 'm getting ~ 20fps vs. ~ 25fps in chrome . 
  i use chrome for heavy webapps , and firefox for regular browsing . 
  [ the citadel demo ] ( http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/ ) gets ~ 60fps in chrome and only ~ 30fps in firefox on my system . 
  [ nytimes mentions ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/world/asia/observers-say-azerbaijan-election-marred-by-fraud.html?_r=0 ) that some us politicians also reported a clean election . 
  [ some older news ] ( http://www.eap-csf.eu/en/news-events/news/az-elections/ ) says that ep was not going to monitor these elections at all . 
  it also speculates the decision was motivated by planned azerbaijan-eu gas pipeline . 
  i also ca n't find any mention of who the mep observers were . 
  [ * `` an unopened door is a happy door .

  err ... this is the us-asia trade deal , not the us-eu trade deal . 
  2500 chf looks very difficult , but 2000 chf could be doable . 
  the budget you mention is n't the entirety of swiss government tax revenue . 
  cantons have separate budgets , no included in the federal one . 
  [ wiki says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) that total swiss tax revenue is around 30 % of gdp . 
  swiss gdp is 571b chf , meaning their current tax revenue is 171b chf . 
  assuming cantons also spend 1/3 of their budget on welfare , the current total welfare costs would be 56b chf . 
  nordic countries seem to be doing fine with tax rates of 40-49 % of gdp . 
  raising the swiss tax an additional 16 % , solely for basic income , would get them to a total of 144b chf , or 2000 chf per swiss . 
  of the `` western '' eu countries , uk , ireland and sweden had no restrictions for the 2004 enlargement . 
  i guess uk introduced work restrictions in 2007 because they [ severely underestimated ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5273356.stm ) the worker influx after the 2004 enlargement . 
  there 's nothing illegal in lithuanians working in the uk . 
  the employment restrictions for lithuania have been lifted in mid-2011 . 
  currently only romania , bulgaria and croatia have restrictions . 
  the rest of `` eastern europe '' _ that 's part of eu _ can work freely in any eu country , including uk , and also norway and iceland . 
  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/job-search/work-permits/ edit : clarified what i mean by eastern europe, 
  note that there might be additional fees if you have an `` internet '' account and you order the transfer via a clerk , instead of the automated internet system . 
  i know ing charges ~ 2eur in that case . 
   ( ... ) it 's lost the equivilent of ca . 
  $ 1.7 billion since it was set up in 1999 it comes out to only a bit over 1 $ per icelander ... per day ... for 14 years ... ... have you guys checked the sofa cushions ? 
  here 's a web version with more information and graphs : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/comparative_price_levels_for_food,_beverages_and_tobacco, 
  maybe . 
  but then there is the cohort of chinese that make the parts of our computers and phones . 
  they seem quite eager to buy european cars . 
  there 's also chinese investors , eg . 
  the ones that took over saab . 
  besides , it could bring all europeans together through their dislike for the official language , with it 's weird logograms and top-to-bottom writing . 
  everyone in eu would have to learn it , and it 'd be useful internationally , seeing as it has by far the [ highest number of native speakers in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers ) . 
  it would be easier to read if the axes were square and had the same value at origin . 
  that way the diagonal would represent equal employment , and it would be easier to tell which county has a female majority and which country is closes to equal employment . 
  i like how they say :  most people do n't understand the dangers of dealing with social networks ... and then link to a facebook page in the description . 
  fair enough , i should n't have included the us president . 
  his power and role is much different than say the german or finnish presidents . 
  in european presidents do n't get any estates with the job and they probably get similar security to other members of the government . 
  i guess you mention presidential inauguration because it 's a big deal in the us and hence costly . 
  it still seems to me that an * european * ceremonial president would be cheaper than a monarch . 
  the article mentions that the king and his wife together get an untaxed yearly salary of ~ 1.4 mil usd which comes out to ~ 1mil eur . 
  for comparison , the yearly salary for the french president is ~ 0.25 mil eur . 
  even the us president is paid only ~ 0.3 mil eur . 
  they also pay income tax . 
  i ca n't tell if a president 's office would cost less than the 6.4 mil usd `` personnel and materials '' allowance the king receives , but i doubt it would be more than that . 
  i think that 's just a housing developer plopping down the same design along the street .
