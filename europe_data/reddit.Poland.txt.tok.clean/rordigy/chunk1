you 've forgotten about v ** [ isengard ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6172/1554461-img7444a9.jpg ) **, 
   korean and japanese are out of the game for diesel engines . 
  hopefully they will stay out of that game , especially japan car makers . 
  since renault/nissan and psa dropped their lovely v6 engines now virtually only lexus is capable of making some interesting petrol ( well , hybrid and they dumped the best v8 engine in thwe world from gs430 exchanging it with inferior hybrid v6 but still better than any small turbocharged pseudoecological engine ) engine . 
   or how about the fact that the ussr invaded and pretty much raped and occupied eastern europe for half a century and you still wo n't admit it was wrong oh , do n't you know ? 
  we were * liberated * by glorious soviet russia ; s and ribbentrop-molotov is just a nazi propaganda !, 
  fixed , thanks , 
  nord stream is just an another example of famous german-ruled eu 's solidarity . 
  i hope visegrad group will follow such example and behave in a similar way , at least when it comes to german affairs . 
  edit : visegard/visegrad . 
  i wish that could happen , really . 
  if all people from eastern europe working now in western europe would go back to their homelands you could easily employ all those new immigrants without hesitation ... https://i.imgur.com/dqta8d4.png, 
  ptsd man , just blame ptsd . 
  i wish all ukrainians could be as reasonable as you ( btw , poles too ) , together we could create much stronger opposition to russian aggression . 
  do you really compare polonization with [ volhynian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ? 
  besides , polonization happened hundreds of years ago ( we even do n't want lvov anymore , keep it and have fun ) and some ukrainians are praising bandera now , in 2015 , can you spot the difference ? 
   i could also point out upper silesians as a largest ethnic minority in poland , but as far as everyday life goes - they are no less polish than anyone in that 96 % majority ( despite of what largest opposition party leader tried to imply by saying that they are `` hidden german option '' whatever the fuck that means ) was n't that about [ silesian autonomy movenent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_autonomy_movement ) ? 
  i can not recall now , but even he would n't be so stupid to call all silesians like that , would he ? 
  same here . 
   most energy comes from internal sources just make sure there are no any russian minorities popping near those sources . 
  we 're improving pretty fast , our emigrants are doing many ` real ' jobs now , not only those basic ones , we 're getting ( slowly , but still going forward ) more and more wealthy so it 's not that bad , we 're just lagging those 50 years . 
  i do n't know how it would end if hitler would won ww2 - maybe every single pole w 'd be eradicated , maybe not , honestly i do n't know . 
  what i wanted to emphasize is that being ` liberated ' and occupied by soviet russia is n't something that can be treated as good thing , we 've escaped one shitty regime just to fall into another and we will have to spend a lot of time to get rid of its traces . 
  instead our development has virtually stopped for 50 years and now we are europe 's poor brother good for cleaning british toilets . 
  we have also another gift from our eastern brothers - broken society - no rspect for public property , no good law , nobody trusts our government , no true political class and so on . 
  we will be rebuilding that for another 50 years just to ( maybe ) get to current western europe development level . 
  of course that is still better than being dead , but not much better . 
   while the american umbrella is nice , i do n't like the feeling of being dependent . 
  nobody does , we too . 
  almost nobody here belives in real support in case of some war against russia ( or little green men coming here ) - we know how it ended last time  - but for now only official politics count . 
   and being paralysed by fear of fsb is not good either . 
  that 's what they want , do n't indulge them . 
  build up your counter-intelligence and regain some confidence . 
  we are trying , but getting out of russian influence is not that easy , you know that . 
  being independent is not a binary switch , in theory we are independent since 1989 but in reality that is a long way to go , i hope we are at least halfway . 
  currently we are trying to build our own nuclear power plant and it goes really bad , maybe it will be finished in 2026 . 
  possessing nuclear weapon is doable only for strong , independent countries and we are still far too weak ( maybe even not so financially/technically but rather politically , no current superpower would allow us to do that ) for that , maybe in 20-30 years it will be real but not now . 
  unfortunately , we are probably still too deeply penetrated by russian fsb so such thing would never succeed . 
  even if we eventually get rid of russian influences our american masters wo n't allow that , that would be a total disaster for their politics so such thing would be very nice for us ( or virtually any other eastern europe nation ) but that is totally impossible . 
   that been said a freelancer with a gross income of 20k $ is below poverty threshold everywhere in europe yet you still fall into [ second tax band ] ( http://www.migrant.info.pl/personal-income-tax-pit.html ) in poland ( 32 % , virtually no tax deductions ) when you earn more than 85k pln which makes 20.3 k $ . 
  just like all countries conquered and occupied by soviet russia , i wish we could get those 50 years back ... 
  even if so than we 've got several confirmations that he said one thing and done someting another . 
  duda is doing things that typical socialist would do , that 's nothing strange and we can not expect virtually anything positive from him , but now it 's hard to tell he is worse than tusk ( except tusk was pm and done different things ) , maybe few years later that will be true , who knows . 
  exactly , tusk who many times proved how big liar he is ( higher vat only for one/two year ( s ) ? 
  going to brussels ? 
  and so on ) is compared to duda who well , have n't done anything till now - of course i do n't expect nothing from him , he is just another face of kaczynski but we 've got one confirmed liar with bad background vs probably liar with bad background . 
  i 'm against him too and did n't vote for him - who sane supports socialists ? 
  but saying dt who ruled for several years and proved what kind of man he is and still claiming he is better than ad or any other politician ... that 's just ridiculous , who except trolls or cp members can do that ? 
  wow , i did n't expect civic platform trolls here on reddit , nice job pal . 
  just for reference , in case of any ` polish death camps ' and similar bullshit history version lovers : [ german provocation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ), 
  err , that image is inaccurate , at least for poland . 
  here 's why : polish minimal wage in 2013 was 1181 pln net monthly ( in 2015 it is 1286,17 pln net monthly ) . 
  for all you westerners - yes , that 's not an error , it is ~ 300 $ monthly . 
  that 1181 net makes 1600 gross and it makes number from that chart ( 1181/1600 = 0.73 ) but that is not full gross amount !, 
  real gross cost is 1929 pln so it is almost ** 40 % ** . 
  for 2015 it is 1286 net / 2110 gross = 39 % tax sorry for polish source but all english calculators seem not to include that difference in their calculations : http://wynagrodzenia.pl/kalkulator_oblicz.php, 
  poland is great to visit from time to time but not so great if you live there and feel all things that are unnoticeable on vacation - low wages , overgrowth bureaucracy , constant law changes , virtually nonexistent public medical healthcare and so on . 
  fortunately almost everything ( maybe except law ) is gradually getting better each year but you wo n't suffer almost anything of it as a tourist . 
  maybe they are training ` defensive invasion ' ? 
  or defence of russian minorities ? 
  or defensive response to aggressive scandinavian threats , i.e. 
  not submitting whole country to russia is a probably quite big threat to russia , is n't it ? 
  i mean physical gold  it 's just in case of bigger financial disaster , probably wo n't be useful but who knows what will happen in 20-30 years . 
  untracked due to possible [ gold seizure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_order_6102 ) in such times , that 's why i put there 10-20 % of my savings . 
  first , no debts above 2-3 % yearly rate . 
  then corporate bonds , etfs , stocks for investment . 
  gold for security , but it 's hard to obtain untracked gold so i do n't have much . 
  almost pure economy , many poles who live in poland and work for polish rates do n't earn enough to cover all expenses after moving out , if you would have to pay all you earn just for rent , utilities , food and clothes then you would think twice about that . 
  oh come on bfv , stop being so racist and islamophobic !, 
   most other european countires would obviously rather risk not offering protection to people that are deserving of it than accept a few criminals more in their countries . 
  that 's understandable , even that would n't be bad if those unwanted people ( real criminals , etc. , nothing * phobic ) would be swiftly expelled and/or judged . 
  now the perception is that they can do anything they like and wo n't response for that because they claim to be war refugees . 
  maybe that 's just wrong perception ( media will follow ` hot ' stories not some dull cases ) and reality does n't look like that ( well , new year 's eve in cologne and hamburg , calais case and several others definitely are n't helpful ) but that 's what is most feared here - that we will be forced to take thousands of people who can do anything here . 
   it has nothing to do with feeling inferior to these people that 's what i sometimes read or hear in our media or even from regular people . 
  sometimes they try to explain such behaviour with thinking like : ` those germans feel guilty for ww2 so now they try to repay for that by accepting anyone who will appear on their border . 
  great , but why we have to suffer because of them ' . 
   you do n't understand why we see it as a moral obligation to help refugees . 
  we do n't have virtually any objections to help real refugees , really . 
  the thing we do n't understand and can not accept is how can you take all people without doing any background checks and keeping all of them despite of problems they cause , just almost like you feel inferior ( in your own country ) to them just because they are not from europe so they have to be tolerated and their crimes ( yes , there might be some criminals in such number of people ! ), 
  have to be masked . 
  almost like you have to integrate with them , not they with you . 
  at least that 's how it looks from here , i 'm not saying it 's truth . 
   we have excellent , long-standing relations with these countries ( especially poland ) and not including them in the visa waiver program is simply a petty insult it 's rather just a way of showing where our place is . 
  * * well , besides that we still exceed yours rejection rate limit ( 10 % ) , it was about 10.8 % last year ( and something about 9.6 the year before ) but since the us are not anymore a ` safe haven ' for us like it used to be in 80 ' and 90 ' this rate should drop in next few years , more people ( especially average joes looking for a simple job just for living ) just move within the eu . 
  is that real ? 
   but i strongly object to calling soviet crimes russian crimes . 
  that 's not that russians are hated here , if something is hated then it 's the soviet state and its apparatchiks , russians are pretty liked here - at least unless they 'll start praising putin , ussr , etc. 
   from the us makes me grin . 
  i w 'd rather say it 's some putinbot claiming to be from the us or maybe living there , even stereotypical americans are n't so stupid , 
  but they are in europe now , are n't they ? 
  you know , i think they should adapt , not us . 
  after all , they are coming here , not us to them . 
  we already do that - we 're just exporting them to the uk , 
   you can see how easy people are riled up against foreigners every day at the moment . 
  when poles in germany will start burning your cars , assaulting women and destroying shops germany ** should ** at least expel them . 
  in theory , yes . 
  on the other hand , if i should take into account their licensing costs and all other factors then why they should not do the same thing ? 
  i would earn much more if i would do the same job i do now but in the us so they should lower price for me , should n't they ? 
  besides , 1 $ = 1 $ is a very popular misconception , simple example : yearly subscription for all jetbrains products costs 649 $ - but only in the us . 
  if you are from eu you have to pay 649 $ + vat .
