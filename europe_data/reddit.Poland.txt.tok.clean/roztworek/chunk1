  hard to believe that russia did n't knew about it before, 
  before i lived for a week in english speaking county i thought i was fluent too  . 
  i could watch movies in english without any problems or have normal conversation . 
  but when i got there i understood how much i still have to learn . 
  using english in everyday situations is something completely different . 
  try going to a fitness club and name exercises others are doing , or naming every piece of equipment there it . 
  well this is wikipedia so maybe someone was just messing around with data  but here you have eurostat data from 2010 http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:figure1_median_gross_hourly_earnings,_all_employees_ ( excluding_apprentices ) _ 2010 . png & filetimestamp = 20130410120200 uk is just above italy there . 
  maybe they pay bigger taxes , work less hours or something changed since 2010 ? 
  i have no time to look closer into it, 
  i stopped reading when he said our debt increased by 500 %, 
  you 're mistaken .

  united europe is noble idea but in reality every nation puts their own interest first . 
  why would germans save greece economy on all costs ? 
  greeks should be pissed on themselves for choosing corrupted and stupid leaders . 
  no one forced them to get into huge debt , lie about it to take euro as currency or even accepting those harsh austerity measures . 
  if they would show middle finger to troika , declare bankruptcy few years back and quit euro zone they would most likely be in much better position now . 
  german politicians are doing whats best for their country and its clearly working well for them . 
  poland thanks to our experience knows that you can count only for yourself.few years ago germans and russians build gas pipe under baltic see that greatly weaken our negotiation position with russians . 
  you think that poles protested at german embassy , burn their flags ? 
  of course that we were pissed , but no one was really surprised . 
  as a result we 're building gas port now to decrease our dependency from russian gazprom . 
  now they are pushing resolution that will force us to lower carbon emission by 80 % to 2050 . 
  it would kill our economy and costs would be much bigger then all what we gained so far from entering eu . 
  our leaders [ vetoed it ] ( http://junkscience.com/2012/03/12/poland-vetoes-e-u-s-2050-carbon-emission-cuts-plan/ ) , you should ask yourself why yours defended foreign interests . 
  you can hear all the time how much money poland gets from eu but you never hear at what cost . 
  before we entered eu all construction works were made by polish companies . 
  now more then half of market is in western companies hands and many polish one bankrupted . 
  its just one of many examples . 
  ** what im trying to say is that there 's no such thing as free money in eu . 
  ** its up to your leaders to take care of your national interest , and to make sure that in the end you benefit more from eu than you lose . 
  never heard about it but it does prove my point  its not like you can trip over bombs when going into forest ... you would have to dig so there 's no huge danger as in mind fields . 
  from this article : they found in his summer house 40 unexploded bombs and metal detector . 
  no one is sure what happen but most likely he died during dismantling one of them ( bomb exploded in his hands ) . 
  he brought it on himself .

  i love world he created and i really think with big names they could make from it movie as good as lord of the rings, 
  you ca n't just check every square meter of forested areas in country as big as poland , none has money for that . 
  still its not like you can trip over bombs when going into forest ... you would have to dig so there 's no huge danger as in mind fields . 
  i do n't think i ever heard in my life about some ww2 bomb going off . 
  usually they find them during construction works , sappers take them to detonate it and thats it . 
  also when there 's good indications that there might be big amount of explosives they actually check it [ like here ] ( http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;rurl=www.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/714723,tony-bomb-i-pociskow-z-ii-wojny-swiatowej-w-lodzkich-lasach,2,6,1,id,t,sm,sg,sa.html%3fcookie%3d1&amp;usg=alkjrhisj9m1agn8jb_voieepufvu1hhnq#galeria-material ),

  i would be stunned too . 
  mostly from the fact that i own a private jet, 
  no potato , only suffering . 
  looks like russians do n't even bother with lube . 
  one thing for sure , its gon na hurt cypriots ... 
  but putting aside cyprus stupid decisions changes in banking industry simply has to be made . 
  current situation is brilliant from bank owners perspective . 
  they gamble with borrowed money , and if they win all profits goes into their own pocket . 
  if they loose its taxpayers who pay the price - one way or another . 
  i do n't think cypriots realize what it means to invite russians into your country . 
  there 's a reason why all eastern european countries try to stay away from them as much as possible, 
   there is $ 27bn in foreign investments i wonder how much of that money comes from russian mafia or companies that were avoiding taxes in eu countries where they were really doing business . 
  if not for the average cypriots i would love those banks to fall . 
  wtf czech republic ... castrated shemale ? 
   we 've let in lots of human rights abusing , care to prove it ? 
   developing/pre-industrial countries ( basically all of eastern europe ) countries invited in 2004 have gdp per capita at least 20-25 % bigger then turkey . 
  http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?t=0&amp;v=67&amp;l=en simple math : few millions if immigrants came from those countries , how many turks ( out of 76 millions and growing rapidly ) you think will immigrate here from poorer turkey ? 
   at least they 're white . 
  but a fairly civilised secular country with a majority muslim population ? 
  fuck those guys !, 
  yes , it has nothing to do with ( no ) woman rights in turkey ( 124 out of 135 countries ) http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_gendergap_report_2012.pdf with them occupying cyprus , denial of armenian genocide , how they treat kurdish minority http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey and many more problems . 
  we should ignore all those issues , after all this kind of thinking worked well with inviting greece to euro zone , right ? 
  they should join when they are ready , but its not going to be anytime soon . 
  after romania and bulgaria we should n't invite another poor country like turkey . 
  at least not for another 20-30 years . 
  do we really want few more millions of muslim immigrants storming our cities ? 
  if we let them in eu only question is how many millions will immigrate here . 
  also with schengen we would have borders with countries like iraq , iran , syria . 
  does n't sound like a smart idea to me . 
  not to mention that they occupy half of one of eu members . 
  funny how hard americans are pushing us to invite turkey to eu . 
  they should give us good example and open borders with mexico , give them permission to legally work in us and billions of $ to develop their country . 
  lovely photo . 
  all you can see in the first glance is those poor children waving in the middle . 
  if you actually count there 's over 50 middle age men 's . 
  good thing their womens are immune to horrors that war brings . 
  georgia , just to mess with putin, 
   you ca n't expect greece to expecto patronum a border force 10 times in size and infrastructure when they are barely scraping by as is . 
  then why are they in schengen in first place ? 
  if by `` that '' you mean russians for no good reason changing rules of the agreement and as result pushing most of polish international transport companies out then i fully agree what ukrainians are doing is something completely different , but its hard to blame them for wanting stick it to their aggressor everywhere they can . 
  why would he do that ?? 
  its his money !, 
   the us was supposed to use a particular method to destroy the plutonium which was irreversible . 
  they unilaterally switched to a different method which does n't destroy , but dilutes the plutonium .
