why ? 
  which is when according to you ? 
   in fact , in the netherlands , the majority aborts at 6 weeks and nearly 90 % at < 12 weeks if you look at the chart , you 'll see that quite a lot of the development happens during between the 6 and 12 week period . 
  as i said , the child can already feel pain at that point . 
  at what point exactly do you consider the fetus to be human , then ? 
  thanks for the input , you 're definitely right . 
  in my past discussions here , i 've seen everything you described . 
   a fertilized egg should never be used as reason to ruin someone life . 
  even after the little biology lesson , you fail to realize the difference between a fertilized egg and a developing baby . 
  mind explaining your position ? 
   fetuses are n't medically considered alive though which is ridiculous , considering that a fetus has a heartbeat by day 18 of its development . 
  take a look at [ this chart ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d4/2b/81/d42b811666d4c5963e00d1e5168fa418--pregnancy-development-fetal-development.jpg ) . 
   having an abortion is n't an easy decision for most . 
  i completely agree . 
   nobody 's forced to carry a dead fetus here again , i agree that the child should be removed if it has died . 
   if it 's banned , people are going to get abortions abroad . 
  they 'll be able to get one in czechia i presume . 
  or worse , they might come up with their own ways of doing it . 
  that 's why the eu should aim to end abortion in all of its member states . 
  it claims to be a champion of human rights , yet it fails to recognize the rights of the most . 
  we 're not barbarians , we live in the 21st century and should n't be running around killing children . 
  for example , when the hungarian government used eu money to fund a pro-life campaign , the eu responded with :  in june 2011 , eu fundamental rights commissioner viviane reding stated , `` this campaign goes against european values . '', 
   if you 're interested , you can have an abortion here up to 22 weeks . 
  [ a baby born at 22 weeks can already survive . 
  ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03065/prem-baby-2_3065546b.jpg ) even at 9 weeks the child has fingerprints , at 12 weeks can smile , at 13 weeks can hiccup and yawn . 
  here is a [ chart ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/fasd/images/chart_928px.jpg ) of fetal development . 
  as you can see , at 22 weeks a child : - has a functioning heart - has functioning arms/legs - has functioning organs ( since week 8 ) - its central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) is in a late stage of development ( can thus feel pain ) - is developing hair , teeth , and is using its limbs ( e.g. 
  can use their hands to grip the umbilical cord )  in my opinion , 22 weeks is too much , but i do think the right to abortion is important . 
  after 22 weeks supposedly one can only abort the pregnancy due to the child 's health being a very serious concern . 
  take a look at the chart and see if you truly support such a barbaric practice . 
   you can not use this argument in abortion . 
  because having a kid will affect a women life . 
  and a person must have the freedom of choice regarding his life . 
  if a woman does n't want to have kids , then she should n't partake in the act of sexual reproduction . 
  actions have consequences and people need to take responsibility for said actions . 
   and if you do , then masturbating is mass muder . 
  i agree that masturbation is immoral and unhealthy , but comparing it to masturbation shows a lack of knowledge in biology . 
  you ca n't compare a [ sperm cell ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tjnjcq2i0eu/maxresdefault.jpg ) that has a limited life span and has not yet fertilized an egg cell ( and only then does an organism begin developing ) to a [ developing human being ] ( http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/fetal_development_slideshow/princ_photo_of_fetus_at_16_weeks.jpg ) .

   ah yes , women seeking abortions are mentally ill killers . 
  you 're the one that drew this conclusion . 
   christian radicals hold power you do n't need to be a christian to support the right to life for children . 
   yet the country seems obsessed with keeping a few muslims out . 
  how is this relevant to the discussion ? 
  keep in mind that rape and health concerns account for less than 4 % of abortions . 
   should a raped woman be obliged to bear her rapist 's child to term ? 
  adoption is always a solution for the child . 
  what crime did they commit ? 
   should the mother be sentenced to uncertain death if pregnancy 's going wrong and threatens her life ? 
  to put it in your terms , do you want to kill two people instead of one ? 
  it depends on which specific disease or complication you 're referring to . 
  as i said before , these account for a very small percentage of abortions . 
  often times , these complications are so serious that it results in the death of the child and option of abortion does n't even need to be available since it 's essentially the removal of an already dead person . 
  you do n't even need to go further than the first couple of pages of your [ comment history ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/jabadabaduh ) to see what i 'm talking about . 
  look at your own post history , lol . 
  most of his posts are about how evil europeans are and how oppressed muslims are , i 'm not too surprised . 
  the same thing that happens to all of those that want to kill other humans but ca n't . 
  what 's the protocol for those type of people in your country ? 
  from what i know , they are usually sent to psychologists to assess their mental health . 
  look at what you just wrote . 
  if people are using this logic , then we might as well legalize murder for all age groups . 
   kiedy przechodzili z narodow\u0105 flag\u0105 przez now\u0105 hut\u0119 there 's the reason why , nowa huta is filled to the brim with criminals . 
  good , the killing of children needs to stop . 
  wilno looks beautiful . 
  i just checked and you are serious , holy shit . 
  i did n't know the french had it in them to do this . 
   one former neighbour in the town of gruenestrasse , where she lived with her parents before they split up last year , said : ` what a b *** h for putting her parents through this . 
  what sort of a person gives themselves over to a group killing her own people in germany ? 
  i hope a jail cell awaits her when she returns , not yellow ribbons . ', 
  exactly , i would n't be surprised if she personally killed people . 
  it was a smart move by your government . 
  it 'd be great if other countries adopted this policy , as more jihadists with european passports will now be caught by the iraqi and syrian forces as isis loses its remaining cities/villages . 
  what are some areas you 'd recommend for tourists ? 
  i 've had some turks tell me that istanbul is mostly a ghetto filled with kurds , but i do n't know how much truth is in that . 
  i 'd love to visit ` constantinople ' . 
  that 's disgusting . 
  this ` child ' refugee looks older than me . 
  where do i apply for asylum to get free swedish real estate ? 
  this is an isolated incident , most jews still think poland is safer for them than western europe . 
  ( may include wilno and lw\u00f3w images ), 
  people have a right to be wary of a small percentage of the population that spreads the most disease . 
   821 days 22 hours 28 minutes and 27 seconds till the next elections ... that pis will win again . 
   given that lithuanians are more prone to crime than the people of mentioned countries . 
  what is your source for this ? 
  is that where lithuanians got their idea ? 
  you 're like that kid from * the sixth sense * that saw dead people everywhere , but instead you see nazis . 
  come on , man . 
  atheism has caused more death in the last century than any religion or religious war . 
  bribery , coercion and threats . 
  turkey is more democratic than the eu . 
   what part of the population believes in natural evolution , rather than some divine creationism accepting the theory of evolution does n't make you more educated . 
  it 's a silly idea that even darwin did n't believe in . 
  yes , i definitely agree . 
  however , i 'm just trying to point out the hypocrisy of trying to blame pis for it when the operation started under po rule and the eu was quiet about it then . 
  this project was started by po , though . 
  good , both are insanely corrupt . 
  meanwhile , there 's people on jihadist watchlists walking around free . 
  it was such men that have carried out most terrorist attacks in europe and even martyred fr . 
  jacques hamel . 
  [ captain european union in reality .
