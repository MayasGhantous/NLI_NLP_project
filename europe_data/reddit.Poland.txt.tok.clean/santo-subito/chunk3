   the whole `` no condoms '' thing that has led to the aids issue in africa what a load of bull . 
  condoms do n't prevent the spread of any stds , let alone aids . 
  if anything , they enable it . 
  before condoms/contraception became mainstream several decades ago , there were only 2 stds . 
  today there are over 20 . 
  i 'm not a troll , but you 're delusional if you actually believe what you write . 
  good day . 
   the major strategy of france was a defensive one . 
  \\  starts military alliance \\  the plan is to hide out in a bunker if your ally is attacked i 'm really starting to understand the defeatist memes about france . 
   did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
  sending a telegram to berlin really deterred their attack in poland . 
  the french are the true heroes of wwii . 
  exactly . 
  hitler knew that if he invaded france or uk , then poland would honor the alliance and attack him . 
  that 's why he attacked us first , but there was no help for us from france and uk . 
  there were lots of ways to avoid this , most notably not allying with countries like france and the uk . 
  they 're doing anything to stay relevant . 
   the pole was telling the swede who can and ca n't be swedish . 
  it 's not something exclusive to sweden . 
  it happens in all other european countries all the time . 
  if you go to africa or asia , the whites there are classified as europeans , even if their families have built and lived in those countries for centuries . 
  my opinion is mine . 
  you can import all the africans and asians you want and call them swedish . 
  you need more than just a passport to belong to a nationality . 
  we had a few attempts last summer because of the pope 's visit and world youth day . 
  he 's not wrong . 
   can you provide us with an example of such a case ? 
  definitely . 
  in this case when i say that it 's out of context , i was specifically referring to / u/dialent where he quotes 1 corinthians 11:2 -16 that talks about head coverings . 
  he purposely excludes the part where it says that a woman 's hair is sufficient for covering of the head ( 1 corinthians 11:15 - for her hair is given to her for a covering ) and tries to make it look like we force women in church to cover themselves like muslims . 
   disturbing shit in the bible do you have any examples on your mind ? 
  i 'd love to address any . 
  right , but the entire premise of the thread is that christianity is evil and its teachings are similar to sharia . 
  the only mentions from scripture i see are from the old testament and thus theoretically the users are really making a case against judaism , not christianity . 
   the bible is comprised of 66 books there are actually 73 . 
   only 4 of which detail the life of christ . 
  his teachings are in all of the books of the new testament . 
  like i said , i invite people to try and find atrocious teachings . 
   the bible also states the death penalty for being gay . 
  i hope you realize this is found in the old testament , which is meant for jews . 
  christians follow the new testament . 
  yeah , some orthodox and catholic women choose to cover their heads with veils when in church for mass/divine liturgy . 
  however , this is not required . 
   atrocious which teachings of christ in the new testament are atrocious ? 
  that 's a stale meme , honestly . 
  perhaps it will if you conveniently take every verse out of context and ignore the central parts like the poster above quoting corinthians . 
  the same verse outlines that the woman 's hair is sufficient covering when in church . 
  similarly it dictates that a man should take off any head coverings ( you 'll notice men taking off hats ) when in church . 
  read the next few verses : '' *** for her hair is given to her for a covering . 
  *** '' these are all signs of respect . 
  nobody is going to behead you for not doing this , unlike in islam . 
  also meant for / u/zilllnaijaboy99, 
  ordained just a couple of weeks ago , good for her . 
  68 % of them were doctors and engineers . 
  i 've been to malm\u00f6 once . 
  you can be in a tourist area and then walk down the same street and you 're in the middle of baghdad/mogadishu . 
  that 's sad to hear . 
  :( i always thought that groups like pkk/ypg and other groups of kurds were the good guys . 
  nice !, 
  in the first few pics i thought you were living in a commieblok , looked similar to some of the ones we have here . 
   you can rent the whole country for about $ 70 ' 000 per day . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  this was never the case , though . 
  st. peter always had primacy over the other apostles . 
  - peter was chosen as the pope in matthew 16:13 -20 - next to jesus , peter is mentioned more than any other apostle in scripture ( 152 times ) . 
  - he stood up and spoke on behalf of the apostles ( mt 19:27 , acts 1:15 , 2:14 ) - he stood up at the birth of the church at the pentecost to lead them . 
  ( acts 2:14 ) - the disciples were referred to as peter and the apostles . 
  ( acts 2:37 , 5:29 ) - peter was given the authority to forgive sins before the rest of the apostles . 
  ( mat 16:18 ) - he was always named first when the apostles were listed ( matthew 10:1 -4 , mark 3:16 -19 , luke 6:14 -16 , acts 1:13 ) -- sometimes it was only `` peter and those who were with him '' ( luke 9:32 ) - john ran ahead of peter to the tomb but upon arriving he stopped and did not go in . 
  he waited and let peter go in . 
  ( jn 20:4 ) - peter stepped out of the boat in the middle of the storm , even though they were all afraid they would die in the storm . 
  ( mat 14:29 ) https://stpeterslist.com/13-biblical-reasons-st-peter-was-the-prince-of-the-apostles the church fathers supported the position of pope peter 's primacy : https://www.catholic.com/tract/peters-primacy ( not going to post all of them here as there 's too much , but there 's even more outside of that website ) . 
  the uk bombed morocco ? 
  huh , til . 
  come home to rome , friend . 
  100 bln is a drop in the bucket . 
  germany still has a long way to go . 
   giedroyc doctrine it 's actually just catholic taqiyya . 
   khuram butt who comes up with these names ? 
  at least it 's not as bad as the moro islamic liberation front ( ** milf ** ) . 
  crusading just is n't as fun without your friends , though . 
  similarly to how we 're going to get back wilno when russia is invading you . 
  i can imagine you desperately searched for the one battle where the heathens did n't run back into the woods after losing 3/4 of their forces .

  happy pentecost !, 
  that 's fine . 
  turks were always our best allies , anyways . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ expect ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ wilno, 
  yeah , but wilno is part of kingdom of poland . 
  you 're free to apply it and most of us would agree . 
  the poles in the uk are n't brits . 
  just visit turkey and identify as a german . 
  they 're the same thing , anyways . 
  polandball meme, 
  daily reminder that rome belongs to the papal states . 
  it was a calculated move to pull the plug because this was getting too much attention . 
  i mean , everything is correct except the vaccine infertility part .
