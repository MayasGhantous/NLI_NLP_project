those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . 
  yes - it was not a country conventional attack - it was a terrorist strike . 
  how many times was any country with nuclear weapon ever attacked ?

  how the hell you will manage that ? 
   german historian ulrike jureit does n't like this common one-sided depiction of `` evil '' germans either . 
  but jureit , who specializes in the culture of memory and remembrance of world war ii , agrees with one of the main complaints . 
  she believes the series is not a realistic depiction of german society in 1941 , given that none of the five protagonists are portrayed as absolute nazis . 
   `` you only have minor characters in the movie that ideologically justify the system to the core and those characters are tagged negatively . 
  and that 's where the movie loses sight of something that was simply reality in germany at that time , also for young people in their early 20s , '' she told dw . 
  how many polish were in this series ? 
  and how were they portrayed ? 
  how was portrayed biggest antinazi resistance movement in europe ? 
   however , the movie 's reception was much different abroad . 
  in poland many were outraged by the series ' portrayal of polish anti-semitism . 
  polish media even talked about a `` falsification of history '' and accused germans of becoming ignorant in their culture of remembrance . 
   it was claimed that `` generation war '' unfairly portrayed the resistance soldiers of the polish home army ( ak ) as one-dimensional nazis , while the five german protagonists were developed into highly complex characters . 
   rest assured , there is no thing such as `` whitewashing '' . 
  i have never encountered a single person , who tried to blame the polish for auschwitz , and if i ever met one , i 'll stand up and speak against it . 
  nor have i ever seen anyone on the tv , radio or in newpapers trying to do so . 
  do you know german tv war series `` unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter '' about ( i 'm a bit malignant now ) good germans and evil antisemitic polish resistance members ? 
  but 30 % of german soldiers was not in antinazi underground resistance like polish blue police http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_police#historical_assessment, 
  that looks a bit like plot of movie [ international ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0963178/ ) ( btw . 
  with one of the best shootouts in cinema history ), 
  if you were member of polish [ ak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army ) ( biggest antinazi resistance movement in europe , but loyal to pre-war polish government ) , then for soviets you were almost like german nazi . 
    home army relations with the soviet red army became increasingly poor over the course of the war . 
  not only had the soviet union invaded poland on 17 september 1939 , following the german invasion beginning 1 september 1939 , but even after the germans invaded the soviet union in june 1941 the latter saw polish partisans loyal to the polish government in exile more as a potential obstacle to soviet plans to take control of postwar poland , than as a potential ally . 
  [ 92 ] on orders from the soviet stavka ( high command ) , issued on 22 june 1943 , [ 93 ] soviet partisans engaged polish partisans in combat , and it has been claimed that they attacked the poles more often than they did the germans . 
  [ 92 ]   in late 1943 the actions of soviet partisans , who had been ordered to destroy home army forces , [ 93 ] even resulted in limited uneasy cooperation between some home army units and german forces . 
  [ 41 ] while the home army still treated the germans as the enemy and conducted operations against them , [ 41 ] when the germans offered arms and supplies to the home army , to be used against the soviet partisans , some polish units in the nowogr\u00f3dek and wilno areas accepted them . 
  however , such arrangements were purely tactical and indicated no ideological collaboration such as was shown by france 's vichy regime or norway 's quisling regime . 
  [ 41 ] the poles ' main motive was to acquire intelligence on the germans and to obtain much-needed equipment . 
  [ 80 ] there were no known joint polish-german operations , and the germans were unsuccessful in recruiting the poles to fight exclusively against the soviet partisans . 
  [ 41 ] furthermore , most such cooperation by local home army commanders with the germans was condemned by home army headquarters . 
  [ 41 ] tadeusz piotrowski quotes joseph rothschild as saying that `` the polish home army was by and large untainted by collaboration '' , and as adding that `` the honor of the ak as a whole is beyond reproach . 
  '' [ 41 ]   with the eastern front entering polish territories in 1944 , the home army established an uneasy truce with the soviets . 
  even so , the main red army and nkvd forces conducted operations against home army partisans , including during or directly after poland 's operation tempest , which the poles had envisioned to be a joint polish-soviet operation against the retreating germans which would also establish polish claims to those territories . 
  [ 4 ] [ 19 ] the home army helped soviet units with scouting assistance , uprisings , and assistance in liberating some cities ( e.g. , operation ostra brama in vilnius , and the lw\u00f3w uprising ) , only to find that immediately afterwards home army troops were arrested , imprisoned -- even executed . 
  [ 16 ] unknown to the poles , their operation tempest had been fatally flawed from the start due to joseph stalin 's intention of ensuring that an independent poland would never re-emerge after the war . 
  [ 94 ]   long after the war , soviet forces continued engaging elements of the home army . 
  many home army soldiers continued their war in an anti-soviet polish underground known as the `` cursed soldiers '' . 
  [ 19 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army#relations_with_the_soviets, 
  there should be also distinction between military-government casualties and civilian casualties . 
  which often fails in relation to muslims from africa and middle east . 
  different values , different history of cultural progress . 
  nevertheless keeping a increasing number of muslim community , even without citizenship , increases chance of staying at least part of them ( i.e. 
  illegally ) . 
  looking west , we would like to avoid that problem of cultural incongruity . 
  ok , but those muslims extremists did n't appear in belgium from nowhere . 
  pulling muslims from north africa increases chance to grow same extremist in our country . 
  this is a main threat . 
  so if terrorist came in boat in crowd of refugees , but he was in fact not syrian means that there is no security problem about immigrants from north africa ? 
  it 's all cool then , right ? 
  but one of those people entered eu along with refugees . 
   the counterfeit document bearing the name ` ahmad al mohammad ' was found alongside the body , whose fingerprints match a man using the name to enter greece in early october . 
  [ the australian way ] ( https://thisistwitchy.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/australia-no-way.jpg ) b-but human rights !, 
  right , but they were germans , not some nazi from the space , which did that in their country and in all europe . 
  in poland you could be killed not only , because you were jew , homosexual , socialist , but also because you were academic professor , owner of prosperous company or political , social activist . 
  also , polish camps prisoners were taken not only because some agenda , but also as random people taken straight from the streets - [ \u0142apanki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundup_ ( history \\ ) ), 
   the death ratio does n't get that high without wholesale collaboration by government institutions down to the local level - by the normal populace . 
  what ?? 
  in occupied poland there was only germany government institutions , on all levels , except of polish blue police fully subordinate to german authorities ( but about 25-30 % of them was a part of underground resistance ) . 
   unlike in most european countries occupied by nazi germany -- where the germans sought and found true collaborators among the locals -- in occupied poland there was no official collaboration either at the political or at the economic level . 
  poland also never officially surrendered to the germans . 
  under german occupation , the polish army continued to fight underground , as armia krajowa and forest partisans -- le\u015bni . 
  the polish resistance movement in world war ii in german-occupied poland was the largest resistance movement in all of occupied europe . 
  as a result , polish citizens were unlikely to be given positions of any significant authority . 
  the vast majority of the pre-war citizenry collaborating with the nazis was the german minority in poland which was offered one of several possible grades of german citizenship . 
  in 1939 , before the german invasion of poland , 800,000 people declared themselves as members of the german minority in poland mostly in pomerania and western silesia . 
  during the war there were about 3 million former polish citizens of german origin who signed the official list of volksdeutsche . 
  people who became volksdeutsche were treated by poles with special contempt , and the fact of them having signed the volksliste constituted high treason according to the polish underground law . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collaboration_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii#poland do you know in which occupied by germans country , there was a death penalty for you and your whole family for helping jews ? 
  only in poland . 
   efforts at rescue were encumbered by several factors . 
  the threat of the death penalty for aiding jews and limited ability to provide for the escapees were often responsible for the fact that most poles were unwilling to provide direct help to a person of jewish origin . 
  this was exacerbated by the fact that the people who were in hiding did not have official ration cards and hence food for them had to be purchased on the black market at high prices . 
  according to emmanuel ringelblum in most cases the money that poles accepted from jews they helped to hide , was taken not out of greed , but out of poverty which poles had to endure during the german occupation . 
  israel gutman has written that the majority of jews who were sheltered by poles paid for their own protection , but sadly , a large number of polish protectors perished along with the people they were hiding . 
   there is general consensus among scholars that , unlike in western europe , polish collaboration with the nazis was insignificant . 
  however , the nazi terror combined with inadequacy of food rations , as well as german greed and the system of corruption as the only `` one language the germans understood well '' , wrecked traditional values . 
  poles helping jews faced unparalleled dangers not only from the german occupiers but also from their own ethnically diverse countrymen including volksdeutsche , and polish ukrainians , many of whom were anti-semitic and morally disoriented by the war . 
  there were people , the so-called szmalcownicy ( `` shmalts people '' from shmalts or szmalec , yiddish and polish for `` grease '' and slang term for money ) , who blackmailed the hiding jews and poles helping the jews , or who turned them to the germans for a reward . 
  outside the cities there were peasants of various ethnic backgrounds looking for jews who hid in the forests , to demand money . 
  notably , there were also jews turning over other jews and non-jewish poles alike , in order to alleviate hunger with the prize . 
  the vast majority of these individuals joined the criminal underworld only after the german occupation and were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people , both jews and the poles who were trying to save them . 
  the threat of denunciation not only deterred many jews from attempting to find shelter among poles , but also forestalled poles of good will who feared denunciators . 
  according to polish wikipedia only in auschwitz there was : jews from poland - 300 000 poles - 70 000 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/struktura_ofiar.svg so of course german occupation impact was not equal both on poles and jews , but polish people ( including part of my family ) also suffered a lot from german genocite . 
  also [ albert the dog abducted by a giant bird ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/27812/ptaszysko_porwalo_albercika_fakt_550.jpeg ) [ he stopped drinking thanks to frogs ] ( http://i.widelec.org/2p3n_s.jpg ), 
  here is great scene of german attack on polish uprising forces in wajda 's kana\u0142 ( 1956 ) . 
  it takes place mostly in sewer canals during evacuation of those voluntary forces in the last days of warsaw uprising . 
  unfortunately it 's not digital remastered version , but it has ( kinda shitty ) english subtitles . 
  nope :p it 's from https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3hkr4e/witcher_sponsored_by_eu/, 
  i think it is the same story about \u0141ks and widzew in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a . 
  and he did n't spawn movement that organised genocide, 
  i think it was more about [ phoney war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) . 
  bombing germany with propaganda leaflets was not very effective . 
  when germany had concentrated almost all army on attacking poland , they were exposed from french border . 
  but french and uk army did n't use any force .
