it is ... if you have ~ 9000 hrs to spend :d, 
  people know , but they do n't want to know , because that makes them - myself included - feel responsible for what 's going out there . 
  and we are , to a point responsible . 
  but we 've reached a wide consensus that we ca n't do much more , so we wait . 
  the only thing we can do now is to press on our representatives so that they will not become any softer . 
  but then people want it to end , but have to wait idly , so they act as if it would have stopped already and then they forget . 
  it 's nothing out of the ordinary and it can not be blamed on anyone or helped . 
  it 's how psychology works . 
  the more you will remind of this the more aggressively detached the people will become . 
  and we ca n't count on a new wave of twenty-something people to oppose , because that demographic is currently focused on the fact that they are jobless and destined for poverty . 
  is civil war somehow better than international war ? 
  and it is civil war in more meanings than one .

  in the morning the hall was being used by school theater and other students ' organizations . 
  wait ... slovenia borders itself ? 
  main reason why in my school phys-ed was always the last class of the day :d, 
  well , it 's a step towards the goal either way . 
  and how expensive is phys-ed anyway ? 
  except for the stadiums , which are being built . 
  have faith !, 
  all in all , this is an issue that should be really addressed by the parents , not by government - i always thought it 's the parents , who want their children to be healthy the most . 
  it does , you just need to stop drinking it for some time . 
  i was drinking soda like every other day , but then just stopped and have n't got one in some 6 months ( summer , a lot of biking and soda was n't helping to quench the thirst ) . 
  then i tasted it on a party and it was unbearable to drink . 
  now i am free . . ( i.e. 
  only dependant on tea and coffee :d ), 
  it would be very hard to make a case out of it to any pole . 
  poland was not being recognized as a country for 123 years by anyone but the ottoman empire ( turkey < 3 ) . 
  half of a world is not that bad :p besides , what 's the limit ? 
  all un members , all countries in the world ? 
  and if all countries , which of them are countries ? 
  you want to ask iran , it 's a country alright , but then what about israel ? 
  you want to ask china , but then what about taiwan ? 
  you ca n't define a country . 
  it 's like the word `` vegetable '' , it has no definition only denotation . 
  [ related ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aiveqmfppk ) . 
  answer to your question is basically the point i wanted to make , by linking this article . 
  it 's hard to define a country , and all definitions are exlusive , as they tend to deny countryship to international bodies that would fancy being a country . 
  for me , an international body is a country , when its power comes from the people / social contract , and it can provide internal and external security to its citizens . 
  and kosovo just proved it can . 
  better than some countries that are not disputed . 
  then maybe you 'd like more : what rusts and wo n't help you to eat soup ? 
  soviet stainless spoon . 
  erm ... make a statement about poland , like `` this is how to effectively piss off poles '' and brace for impact . 
  like seriously , it does n't matter what the statement says . 
  it is wrong as long as you have n't go throught the rite of bruderschaft with pole :d, 
   yeah i 'm not sure i follow as well . 
  czechoslovakia one very specific ** former ** central european country . 
  ftfy :p, 
  so in the countries marked blue every student is subsidized in 100 % ? 
  which is just as false . 
  and what about crimean tatars ? 
  should they state that for the whole time crimea was really turkish ? 
  after all , the last peace treaty between russia and ottoman empire , regarding crimea , states that if russia is ever going to transfer crimea to anyone , ottomans can once again make claims towards the possesion of it . 
  and since turkey is the legal continuation of ottoman empire under different political system . . 
  one thing that makes me laugh is how possitive some of russians are that crimea was always russian . 
  while it was cimmerian , scythian , greek , roman , gothic , hunnic , bulgarian , russian , byzantine , venetian , genoan , mongolian , turkish , russian , turkish , russian , turkish , russian ... [ * sigh * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eviyrrjtty ) to be clear , i 'm not taking the right to live in the country of chosing from people . 
  but such absolute and perfectly ignorant statements are what drives revisioninsm and conquest . 
  if you 've already labelled her as paranoid , what difference could her explanations possibly make ? 
  her stories could have been just as easily dismissed as lies , so that feels like a lost effort . 
  she 's not contradicting herself when she comes out in public . 
  she had said that the fsb or whatever have hinted her indirectly that they know she took part in the demonstration . 
  so how can she worsen her situation by talking about something they already know ? 
  i 'm not strongly saying it 's true , i 'm saying it 's not self-contradictory . 
  on the contrary , coming out in public makes her safer , cause now it would be effing suspicious if she had some tragic accident . 
  of course it improved . 
  i just mean that emmigration was a factor . 
  it was n't just emmigration though , the people who emmigrated where well educated but in disciplines unfit for polish market . 
  so they went to markets where their skills are required and in turn there came people to poland , whose expertise was useful on polish market . 
  both these factors ruled each other out - on the economical level , torn families are for another discussion - and both helped out greatly the polish economy . 
  i want to stress this out , because the underlying cause for the first emmigration was not removed and we face another one starting now . 
  the cause being education system that is being irrelevant to the market needs , both in what and how it teaches . 
  the people exchange is not an issue , but only as long as there are markets outside poland that can contain young people who ca n't find jobs here , and there are people outside who are willing to come and work in poland . 
  but you ca n't expect an animal to know when it is `` decent '' and usefull to show off the adorable part , and when they should eat , copulate and defecate . 
  also the children should not be kept in a bubble or lied to about the world . 
  even if the lies are white or polite . 
  this is my opinion but it comes from the fact that i resent my parents lying to me , which gave me false - idealistic - view of the world that was later painfully shattered . 
  these mediocres are the best what we have right now , so they are worth preserving . 
  especially because there is no alternative , like seriously none . 
  and i do n't mean world 's view , i mean effectivness . 
  the only other party i would believe is somewhat prepared to govern are socialdemocrats , but they are not in a winnable position , because - in turn - of inability to reach the people . 
  and the others ... * law and justice - do n't know how world , or even a country works . 
  * palikot 's movement - they concentrate on legalisation of cannabis and taxing the church , while the world is on fire - which clearly annoys them , and they do n't have a clue what to do about it * real-politik union - ... misogyns ( one of them publicly endorsed beating wives if they `` misbehave '' ) , homophobes , hinting that paedophilia is acceptable as less severe than rape , going after ecological regulations and wanting to deconstruct public transport , because it 's a hit to man 's freedom ... their set of views is just ridiculus ; shame cause otherwise they used to be the only true and reasonable liberals ( circa 10 years ago ) . 
  * polish people 's faction - maybe even competent enough but too small , insignificant and used to being the party that allows other parties to rule by forming coalitions . 
  * micro mild right-wing parties - living in their world of knights and windmills , too romantic to achieve anything , not able to make compromises , which keeps them microscale . 
   mass emigration started ( ... ) unemployment decreased from 21 % to 9 %, 
  oh come on , that 's not even a subject to being prude . 
  these are animals , it 's what they do . 
  what about dogs fucking on the streets ? 
  and pidgeons , cats and so on . 
  complaining that you 're going to see copulating animals in zoo is like going on holiday and complaining to the office that the weather was bad . 
  laugh it away or teach the children how nature works basically . 
  and if not go to zoo to see the animals being animals than why go there ? 
  mhm xd the affair is shameful , but it 's almost worth it for that title . 
  sadly , he will continue to move forward until he feels a bayonet pushing against his chest . 
  last time i heard about russians in baltic states they were happy and impregnated against kremlin 's bs propaganda , because compared to russia , estonia , lithuania and latvia are equally awesome places to live . 
  poland is sometimes shown as an example of successful economical transformation , but truthfully baltic states put us in shame . 
  so one would have to be mad to think he 'll be better off in russia . 
  it 's not how you undermine authority though .
