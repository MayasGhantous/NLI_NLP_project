  the service is a product , for which demand was created by culture to which the ad itself is symptomatic . . 
  if that makes any sense . 
  that looks like great fun !, 
  i wish warsaw had one of these . 
  we have `` river trams '' on vistula , but they operate with boats . 
  my tram is giving yours a [ tram-look ] ( http://tramwar4.republika.pl/3103-90450-z.jpg ) . 
  we had one , but it broke down . 
  now we can not into space anymore : c the buses ' floors are too low ;(, 
  o : is this amphibious ? 
   it 's almost as if our culture treats female body parts only in terms of their sex appeal ; i would argue that 's what this ad is about . 
  and at least here that is the sad case , and i hate it . 
  people are trying to sell everything with boobs . . even overalls . 
  [ ahh ] ( http://goo.gl/x3ssmp ) my childhood :') next to nothing beats the ikarus . 
  they were sturdy and reliable . 
  new buses we have now here are fancy , but they do n't stand the test of time , while some ikarus buses were in service for 20-30 years . 
  and recently last of them went out of service in warsaw . 
  edit : broken link . 
  sign me up . 
  25 deg is like tropics for me . 
  and the skin burns . 
  lol . 
  it entails common typo , though it 's origin is somewhat mysterious to me , as i do n't know how was i able to put `` wfk '' instead of `` wtf '' . 
  it must be either micro-blackout or alien abduction . 
  sorry for that . 
  but i 'll not correct this . 
  i will wear it as a sign of my eternal shame : c, 
  yeah , when i saw it i was wfk-ing for 5 minutes . 
  it was supposed to promote parents checking safety of the bus they send their children on holidays in . 
  but the effect was opposite . 
  my friend 's 5yo daughter was crying when she saw fancy shiny bus she was supposed to ride , because `` the sad bus had to die '' ... edit : but fortunately people made alternate endings : [ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeh5hiootg ) [ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgcfmkf4dte&amp;t=1m30s ), 
  that 's true , warsaw is still growing , so the money discrepancy is not a massive problrm here yet . 
  but the hate war - fortunatelly only verbal - between the born warsovians and those who came here to work is raging on . 
  the first are treating the other almost as some under-species : they loiter , they steal , they destroy public property and so on ; most that 's bad is their fault really , to some those rooted here . 
  and these migrants are viewed by the other side as worse educated ( which is bullshit , since mostly people come to warsaw to study and then start working ) , impolite , even dumber . 
  all because they are from smaller towns . 
  on the other hand the migrants hate back , which is natural really , when you are disregarded and call names ( they are called `` jars '' , because they often govback to families for the weekend and return with food in jars ) . 
  and then there is the other , thankfully larger group of born warsovians , including myself , who do n't know what is the fuss about . 
  the migrants are regarded as not caring for the city and even hating it ; and so why they stay instead of leaving home , these disrespectful warsovians ask . 
  while the answer is as easy as money and prospects . 
  besides how one can feel in a place when he encounters active hate ( more the internet hate than hatred thankfully ) , and has to live away from family and friends because of imbalanced country 's growth . 
  the only real problem is that the migrants often does n't notice our tax office that they change place of living , so they pay taxes outside warsaw ( here the taxes are divided between national and local governments ) . 
  but even that is already worked on by the city . 
  it was lately proposed that people who pay taxes in warsaw should have access to commuteral transport for free ( it would be financed from city 's taxes ) . 
  sorry , for the overinformative post , 
  ok . say no more xd, 
  therefore it 's genious ( ^ ^,

  directly it 's methane . 
  ok , since i 'm seeing this bus thing here for the second time question : what do you do when the number of people in the bus gets bigger than the half of the seats ? 
  from what i know it is n't . 
  and the bowmen would present their fingers , while put together , to show they still have them . 
  which was meant as an insult . 
  mostly because all the bowmen were lower classes , while french were nobles . 
   do n't do stupid shit like wander off alone at night , or try to hitchhike . 
  especially if you 're white . 
  hum . . 
  i remember `` incredible india '' commercial ( i used to watch a lot of eurosport ) where a white dude is riding on an elephant , `` immersing into culture '' , taking spices from trade stands without paying and hitchhiking . 
  have you considered your tourism ministry is sending mixed signals ? 
  not . 
  try to convert any of us to christianity ( i 've had this happen to me , annoying as hell , and a colossal waste of an hour ) . 
  most young indians do n't give two shits about religion , but will definitely get angry with you if you try this . 
  random tourists do that in india ? 
  :| i think it 's annoying as hell to anyone , and nevermind what religion . 
  in poland we have currently invasion of mormons . 
  hum ... sounds a lot like warsaw actually . 
  i would so fancy it being the case here :( people here are awful when it comes to pedestrian-cyclists space violation . 
  on both sides , but on cycling paths you can find anything from pedestrians to kids on scooters and mothers with ... how are these called - small carriages with babies inside ( :p ) . 
  this is a bit counter-intuitive . 
  i always thought of sweden as very socially involved - to a point where lost child can bother random pedestrian and ask them to be walked home . 
  and if the above is true than this bus-isolation is even more mind boggling to me . 
  not that i condemn , i do not like random contacts and talking to just fill the space myself . 
  hey , a caravan is at least a soft target :d you have to understand that doing 240km/h on a highway is a foreign concept to ... pretty much everybody else . 
  there should be signs in all languages at all highway entrances stating in heavy language that you 're supposed to go ** fast ** from now on , until further notified :p on a related note i have one `` do '' . 
  ** do ** learn the word ausfahrt before going to germany to not embarrass yourself in front of gas station manager , asking about tourist attractions in ausfahrt-stadt . 
   do not talk to the bus driver when driving . 
  that 's rather like common sense . . people do that ? 
  i can find context for question about the war in a zoo ... 
  i 'm going straight to hell * sigh *, 
  hum ... sounds like poland in the 90 's . 
  went in in a car , went out naked . 
  maybe you just need a critical mass of tourists ? 
   european countries would be sensitive to this kind of stuff . 
  do n't make the same mistake he did . 
  the story is about one mistaken doctor . 
  with the other part i agree : it is just helping to spin the spiral of hate faster . 
   in fact , is there any part of any international law which says `` you may refuse to treat patients if they are particularly bad people '' ? 
  since even sentenced to death receive medical treatment and die healthy men i guess not . 
  but i fear i 've fallen into rhetorical question trap . . 
  i see . 
  i 'm sorry for the condescending tone than . 
  cheers , 
  dear sir or madam . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  we know it 's gon na hit us . 
  and it 's not only apples , a whole range of fruits and vegetables got banned . 
  meat is probably next and winter is coming ( c ) . 
  but this campaign , at least to me , is a way to say that we wont back up from our position on the matters in the immediate east , because of this inconveniences . 
  i do hope that polish producers will also get real help , in form of trade negotiations and subsidies - at the expense of poles not whole eu . 
  this tweets are a way to keep our spirits high and show solidarity with our countrymen , who are the casualties - thankfully only economical - on the line of ideals . 
  just as certain other brave nation was unfolding umbrellas when bombs were falling on its capital .
