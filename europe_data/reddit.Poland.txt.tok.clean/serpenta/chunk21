  additionally , he reports , the event was ignored by the tram conductor . 
  professor 's specialty is recent history of poland , he is interested mostly in the area of polish-german relations after ww ii . 
  because of his interests he knows german very well , and he published multiple papers in this language . 
  he was lecturing at several german universities , including in jena , for several years . 
  he is attached to the institute of history at university of warsaw . 
  the students and graduates of the institute have written a letter , standing by professor kochanowski . 
  '' [ ... ] we would like to express strong opposition against the attack that was directed at one of our professors , jerzy kochanowski '' - they write . 
  `` we can not comprehend what is the reason behind the process of transformation of a place that had been always friendly , multi-cultural and open , into one xenophobic and nationalistic . 
  we do not condone with this process '' - the students write and they stress that they `` do not want to live in times , when talking in other than mother tongue causes aggression and assaults '' . 
  `` as students who were tought throughout many years that we need to learn from errors of history , so that its darkest events never are to repeat , we can not condone with such behavior '' - they write in the letter . 
  but then , how would be the articles proliferated ? 
  either i do not get something , or the lawmaker does n't understand how www works . 
  also , i would hope that by `` for profit '' they mean gaining income by the landing page , and so reproducing the original content and then linking , not linking to the original . 
  because who gains any profit off the act of linking to the source ? 
  o_o edit : because it does make sense to make the people who are knowingly linking to copyright infringing content , complicit in the copyright infringment . 
  especially , if they are being paid for spreading the link . 
  the paradoxes of arbitralism . 
  i disagree . 
  beaches are for being frivolous and careless . 
  if someone needs to be dressed to be careless they should be allowed to . 
  and then , i do n't think we should subject someone whose 20-30 years long life thought them something to suddenly change it just because they are in rome . 
  i thought we are more civilized than that and that europe cherishes diversity . 
  as for the quasi-choice burkini is , i agree here . 
  but will banning burkinis solve these women 's problems inherent to their social niche , or will it only devoid them of the pleasure that the beach gives ? 
  if you want burkini out for what it represents , not for the piece of cloth it is made of , then you should work the other way around . 
  solving actual problems , and not treating the symptoms of those problems as things to tackle on their own and in void . 
  solve their problems , liberate them and burkinis will disappear ; they will most likely choose to conform with majority and become as bleak , uninteresting , same-y , and unremarkable as people apparently want them to be . 
  but that is harder . 
  and i am offended by lack of taste that how some women exhibit when they match colors . 
  in poland we call it `` ass-ache '' , and we have a lotion to treat it . 
  because really , if how someone looks / is dressed will spoil your day at a beach , then there 's something wrong with you rather than with them . 
  edit : then \\ than ... * sigh *, 
  in a democracy we are free to act as stupid as we like  but your guideline for this seems reasonable . 
  this is a question that can be asked about many things to which answer is personal preference : `` if yellow is as a color as green , why wear green dress ? '', 
  the difference is where this preference comes from . 
  if you will start segregating people 's preferences ... just good luck proving what was the base for a preference . 
  as a sceptic i very much doubt anyone could do it for their own preferences , not to mention someone elses . 
  by the same virtue bikini is a symbol of oversexualization of human body , and objectification of women . 
  it was designed in the 60 's , was it not ? 
  does france stand by these ` values ' ? 
  also , freedom ** of ** religion is basic human right . 
  and that includes ability to follow one 's religion as far as it does not collide with the freedom of others . 
  which is both basic definition of freedom , and something sartre would agree with , and he was both french and said that `` the other is one 's hell '' . 
  but i never meant to allow someone to force someone else to be dressed more . 
  but at the same time , and because of that very position , i can not let anyone to force someone else to be dressed less . 
  being in majority does not let you to say `` no '' to someone who wants to enter the beach , because they are not following the trend and so they are sore to the eye . 
  that 's not democratic at all . 
  as for the explaning part . 
  i am always willing to try and discuss views i see as off . 
  but after a point is reached when the language is understood by both sides and there is nothing to be said more clearly it is time to agree to disagree . 
  unless someone threatens themselves / someone else i will not try to burst their bubble . 
  because i am pretty sure i enjoy having one on my own . 
  also , only noticed now : good movie , 
  but how does the ` burkini ' differ from t-shirt and pair of shorts / leggings ? 
  is it somehow legalized in terms of islamic reign ? 
  it 's an honest question , because i thought it 's just a piece of clothing that follows niche fashion related to sub-culture . 
  but what if someone is just not comfortable with showing their skin / body , but likes sun , sand and water together ? 
  does it matter if it was imprinted in them by this or that ideology ? 
  does it matter if it was ideology or personal experience ? 
  are they allowed if it was the latter ? 
  and are people not really respecting the ideology they think they follow something uncommon ? 
  should we start banning catholic for having unprotected sex , if it is pre-marital ? 
  i must say this is at least bizzare . 
  and also i have a question , and honest one , if i am not religiously motivated , i just do n't like / want to show off my skin , am i still banned from wearing those ? 
  i am saddened , because it seems to me that france is slowly creeping towards denial of human rights . 
  did i miss something , or have they confused the continents ? 
  seems to me the acts of terror were pretty racially indiscriminate in europe lately . 
  i guess ... we can be proud ? 
  are you a cartographer ? 
  shame you were n't around when they were drawing [ these ] ( https://geolounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ebstorfer-stich.jpg ) blobs . 
  all the hours put into sengoku jidai paid off xd, 
   get off your arse , stop blaming the jews for all the problems in the world or plotting how many people you can run over in a car and go to work . 
  were you only able to come up with ridiculus ad personam rant ? 
  chill down some , jesus . 
  do you have any base to support the idea of me being an antisemite , or do you just like to defame people , taking advantage of anonymity ? 
  and what gave you the idea i might be unemployed ? 
  you just hear trigger word , and you instantly know what kind of a person you are dealing with ? 
  grow up , dude . 
  cheers . 
  if you seclude a group of people in a place where is no visible future for them , their kids or even grandkids , ** you ** have created terrorists training facility . 
  and palestine is just that . 
  i do n't mean by this that it removes the responsibility from the attackers . 
  but you ca n't exactly then run about your neighbourhood , screaming `` omg , what ** has ** happened , why ** is ** this happening to us ? '', 
  and not look rather silly . 
  in case of israel , they have made sure themselves ( and i mean country not necessarily people ) everyone around them hates them , doing something that was universally deemed unfair , because a creature from 3000 yo story book told them it 's ok . 
  it 's the other way around actually . 
  which means that you are pretty well off when you join . 
  it 's like in this joke : '' - i would like to have money to buy an elephant . 
  - what do you need an elephant for ? 
  - nothing , i would just like to have that money . '', 
  is it anything different though ? 
  the consequence for turkey is the same . 
  you could argue that we are better off . 
  but are we better off , having a neighbour that unstable ? 
  we are starting to dwell on interpretations of interpretations :d but no , i do not suspect that was the intention . 
  it is just a logical consequence . 
  and those often go past unseen . 
  no , i think / u/lolkac meant that saying `` thank god turkey will never enter the eu '' translates to saying `` thank god turkey will never be democratic country with working economy '' , which is a bizzare wish to have . 
  would have been nice if the uk did n't mingle with the middle east , setting artificial borders left and right , after the ww2 . 
  would have been even nicer if european powers did n't occupy the middle east in the first place .
