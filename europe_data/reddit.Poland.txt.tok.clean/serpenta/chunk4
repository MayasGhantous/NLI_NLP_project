  i 'm with you on that one :d, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz4ps55rx40 ), 
  i was never thinking that they would . 
  i was just unsure whether putin was not talking out of his ass , making claims on behalf of ussr . 
  still , to me it 's like poland and lithuania would make territorial claims towards belarus , on behalf of lit-pol commonwealth . 
  during the crimean crisis , in phone call with mustafa dzhemilev - the leader of crimean tatars - putin reportedly said that the ukrainian proclamation of independence did not completely meet the ussr procedures for leaving the union . 
  is there legal continuity between ussr and russia though ? 
  `` sieg fail '' xd, 
  meh , we would just need to work on improving infrastructure , 
  gas is new oil , so sorry ( (, 
  oh come on , if israel can be in europe then who will tell you that you ca n't ? 
  it is . 
  we were once the rulers of the world and we have left it burning . 
  i got things mixed up then , sorry . 
  but do you think that we , as in the european part of nato , have enough forces to defend ourselves , without having to depend on american help ? 
  what you said is true : poles feel safe around germany , germany feels safe around france , france feels safe around uk . 
  so people got relaxed - maybe overly relaxed . 
  because there are two possibilities when it comes to russian behavior - either our relations with them were indeed good , russia was trying to integrate and globalize , and then something went south and they indeed act like a scared animal or it never happened and we were ( myself included ) just delusional because of our hopes for eternal peace in europe . 
  in case of ukraine i do n't mean invasion , but we are in nato to secure our safety . 
  i do n't even mean act as nato , but we can act in coordinated manner , because we are in nato - european countries and us - imposing sanctions and reinforcing ukraine with supplies . 
  they need things as trivial as car batteries . 
  whoa , so the logic is : let 's not intervene in ukraine as nato , although it 's happening next doors and ukrainians are `` friends '' , because americans had forced nato to intervene in the middle east ? 
  or am i not following you ? 
  could you make a link to the inverse as well ? 
  at some times of day / r/europe becomes one of my news sites for the matter , as i do n't have time for much else , and it would help me greatly if i could have a quick glimpse on whether i 'm still living in the country i 've woken up in :p, 
   your move , putin !, 
  rather : your move , obama !, 
  this happened right after american president gives security guarantees on behalf of us and nato to estonia . 
  if this abduction is not related act , aimed to mock those guarantees then i am kayser soze . 
  putin just said : look , you got guarantees from this big man obama , yet i can abduct ** anyone ** from ** your territory ** . 
  which is freaking strange , because ussr anthem is for * homo sovieticus * . 
  when soviets were at powers russians and russian nationality was oppressed , during stalin era nearly no highest officials were ethnic russians , and the european russians ( the white russians ) disliked other ethnic groups within ussr , because the former were not treated as superior anymore ( well i guess before that they disliked them because they felt the latter were inferior ) . 
  so in short , russians were not in best position in ussr , and taking the anthem now , when putin and other high staff russians are pretty much building racial supremacy theory , is strange to me . 
  maybe he is acting to further boost popularity . 
  you know , firm for the enemies and sensitive when it comes to matushka rassiya . 
  yea i agree , it would be objectively disappointing . 
  our kids already have strange names like vanessa and xavier , we love guinness and have hundreds of national dishes made of potatoes . 
  our language is so diluted that people from warsaw ca n't understand those from radom . 
  and football ? 
  since 1990 's our players play well only outside of poland !, 
  your petty schemes are not going to work !, 
  ... if only not for the hair, 
  we put a man there as well . 
  he came back , and said it 's cold and dark . 
  so we 're not interested , thank you !, 
  or you 'll get to raise them and pay for their education , and they 'll come back as freebie workers !, 
  celibate means no kids and yet vatican has not died out yet . 
  so they have to `` import '' their population increase ... 
  i do n't think i can make this joke in english , sorry : c, 
  i know mostly academics , and academics have natural tendency towards celibate . 
  i guess i mixed the two , damn ... 
  but i feel better now . 
  my next question would be `` do you think it 's nice to steal others positive birth rate ? 
  and we were praying to our pope before he became saint !, 
  ( which either makes him the best pope or us the most damned ) . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i love poles , just not when met abroad . 
   come spend your holiday in romania !, 
  you car is already here !, 
  i remember when this was a running joke about poland , in poland . 
  * sniff *, 
  i have zero problems with that , they kind of still speak on our behalf . 
  so first question : why celibate ? 
  maybe a census should be made . 
   is there any reason for that ? 
  ignorance mixed with racism . 
  to most `` romanian '' has equal meaning to `` gypsy '' , and people here both casually hate and fear gypsies . 
  the first one comes from the fact that most gypsies , in warsaw at least , begs for a living . 
  literally . 
  and the second one is classical unknown factor - they keep to themselves and do n't assimilate . 
  this is simply an outrage . 
  i ca n't even force my eyelids to lower down . 
  how very dare they to do something like this . 
  nato and eu have to make the eastern borders airtight asap , to make such provocations impossible in the future . 
  i am very sorry that you are being bullied :( ( i hope it all end well soon for the victim , and that he wo n't be held hostage . 
  this would be heart-tearing . 
  no it is not . 
  not compared to russia anyway . 
  careful comparisons estimate , that up to scale polish economy is four times stronger than russian . 
  putin does what hitler did - which was brilliant - he tries to convince everyone around that he ( russia ) is strong . 
  he goes for the next cold war , while russia have n't even recovered from the last one . 
  not at all , but the / u/honigtopfpegasus 's response to / u/fruity _ pies 's objections was that the post can be debated whether it is hilarious or not , i believe . 
  [ hello , we are talking about hilarity . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msyihapmdi8 ), 
  but ukraine is already indebted , because of overdue gas payments . 
  ngh , yea true but mongols were more of a natural disaster than country , when they took it . 
  but i guess i wo n't save myself with semantics :d therefore : touch\u00e9 . 
  i believe reparations were calculated/estimated , not an arbitrary statement like this . 
  `` i demand 1 billion dollars '' sounds like austin powers line to me . 
  i think lit-pol commonwealth is still the only state that had ever held moscov . 
  so i guess we should nominate someone , in the spirit of ice bucket challenge ... 
  but seriously , i think he meant defensive/preventive war , not expansive . 
  it did n't evacuate these people as well . 
  so this is how it looks : you killed my citizens and destroyed infrastructure , therefore i demand an absolutely arbitrary amount of money , so they can be spent on . . what exactly ? 
  i maybe paranoid about this - i 'm pole for one thing - but russia is losing money , and they would sure as hell fancy some dollars , mostly because they are dollars and do n't inflate like ruble . 
  so i doubt in sincerity of this claim , because kremlin was exposing these people in the first place . 
  so in short , i think the collateral victims should be compensated but i would n't trust the state of russia to give it the money to . 
  * sigh * problem with this whole conflict is that there 's not enough information from either of the sides , so what is left are sympathies rather than analysis . 
  of course . 
  but there is a strong contrast between what russia is doing in helping the separatists and this legal and lawful flip-flop .
