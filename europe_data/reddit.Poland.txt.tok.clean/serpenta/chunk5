  what ... who is calling to eradicate russian-speaking populace ? 
  the russian speakers are finding shelter in the west of ukraine . 
  also , where are they going to sue them ? 
  in russian court - good luck with that :d ukraine should in turn sue russian army for trespassing . 
  the data seems to be eurostat ^ [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/employment_statistics ) . 
  it 's derived from the employment rate , which defines `` employed person '' as `` person aged 15 and over ( or 16 and over in iceland and norway ) who during the reference week performed work - even if just for one hour a week - for pay , profit or family gain '' ^ [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/glossary:employed_person ) so it would include all possible job contract types in poland , which makes the stats remarkably better than i would have thought , but then again worst in the whole bloody europe (  .  ) edit : sorry , i did n't notice there 's actually written `` eurostat '' on the chart :d, 
   then this idiot genius had to be more careful in corning his opponent by misquoting him i do n't think it 's the case . 
  i think putin said what barroso reported , but the former now threatens , with something that barroso does n't want to be quoted on , so the latter stands down . 
  there was this polish saying , mocking soviet army : `` we will fight for peace to the last bullet '' . 
  double standards ftw . 
   i have n't read about any recruiting in denmark - do you have a source for that since i would very much like to know more . 
  i interpreted this below as recruitment . 
  it 's from the article linked as op . 
   east jutland police also estimate that of the at least 100 men who have left denmark to fight in syria , at least 22 of them come from grimh\u00f8jmoskeen . 
   `` we can definitely say that when you go to that mosque , there is an increased risk of heading off for syria , '' police spokesman allan aarslev told tv2 \u00d8stylland earlier this year . 
   a recent report from the economist calculated that when measured by total population , denmark has sent the second-highest number of foreign fighters to syria . 
  only belgium has a higher number of foreign fighters per million residents . 
  i got that . 
  but from what i read i see that some mosque - be it it 's leader or the institution - has declared support for isis , that comparatively large number of isis fighters from europe recruits from denmark , and that the police is monitoring internal situation . 
  i 'm just confused as to how this could potentially lead to the rise of national socialism . 
  and where : in denmark or in is ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
  it 's the matter of ethics imo . 
  capitalism where universal ethic is consequentional utilitarism * ( deeds are jugded by their consequences for the good of all or some group , the evalutation is relative to circumstances ) * would be unbearable ; but with deontonological personalism * ( deeds are judged by their intended impact on a person , the evaluation is not relative to circumstances ) * it is the best we have . 
  ukraine is invaded to create a frozen conflict that disables them from entering nato/eu - like georgia was in 2008 . 
  so first he creates those frozen conflicts around former ussr and then , because he does n't believe in nato doing a thing in the case of smaller eu states being attacked , he attacks some nato member and - in his mind the alliance does n't act . 
  and then the alliance ends . 
  the us are not regarded as able to defend their allies around the world anymore , which creates a new world order , with china and russia being able to set their own spheres of influence . 
  us is then effectively removed from europe and russia comes in giving weak europe little choice but to join its sphere of influence under the threat of invasion . 
   i 'd just like to remind everyone that this is just some analyst 's theory , none of this is official . 
  of course it 's speculation , but what else can we do here beyond speculation ? 
  iirc , eastern germany were inhabited by slavs in vi/vii century . 
  they were then pushed southwards by germanic peoples and have later become yugo-slavs . 
  but apparently , despite slavic name for germans being `` the people who ca n't talk '' , some slavic language has survived in german . 
  even the ethymology of * berlin * holds one or two slavic theories . 
  much happenings , of thankings polan are :3, 
  you ca n't top that :3, 
  * krakau * is a sound that a crow makes  . , 
  * gda\u0144sk * is slavic name that came about from some nearby river that is now being called something else - yeah . 
  latin name has always been * dantis * . 
  / u/paristetris latin name of * pozna\u0144 * is * posnania * , latin for * wroc\u0142aw * * vratislava * , * warsaw * * varsovia * , * krak\u00f3w * * cracovia * and so on . 
  so it really makes sense to call gda\u0144sk * danzig * / * dantis * in english - as eerily as it may sound - because of latin , which is the base of all western european languages , when it comes to vocabulary . 
  997 to be exact . 
  until 1227 it belonged to the kingdom of poland , and has been taken since by duchy of pomerania . 
  and then ... uneasy history . 
  also kevlar vests . 
  people whose trade is micro trading between polish and ukrainian border are now mainly moving personal military gear , like vests , helmets and uniforms . 
  one set at a time due to regulations ... not sure if polish or eu . 
  but some programmers from gsc formed [ 4a games ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4a_games ) later , which has released metro 2033 , metro last light , and recently the remakes in dual release called metro redux [ ( metacritic ) ] ( http://www.metacritic.com/search/all/metro%20redux/results ) ( pc , xb1 , ps4 ) . 
  these were made on an engine they had developed , which supposedly is available for licensing ( if there are any developers that want to make a game , need engine and are ready to make politically driven choice out there i guess ... ) . 
  anyway , the games are great and it would n't be just charity to buy them , in my opinion . 
  [ obolon ] ( http://www.obolon.ua/ ) makes great beers and other beverages , like [ kvass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) , which is really fine for hot ... days ... :d but seriously it 's great to satisfy thirst , while not being very ( or not at all ) alcoholic . 
  edit : also , for easier search , ukrainian ean-13 barcode is 482 , so if the barcode starts with 482 the product has come from ukraine . 
  to answer the obvious question , russian codes start with 460 to 469 . 
   putin & co already created self-inflicted food embargo , in the next month they are going to forbid import of drugs . 
  and , for example , almost 100 % of insulin in the country is imported . 
  what ? 
  is he really that mad ? 
  how are you going to cover that with domestic production ?!, 
  this is not luxury product we can all joke about , this is a matter of life and death to some . 
  is he going to put blame for that on the west as well . . 
  the logic is , if russia attacks a nato member , and the allies do nothing or not much then other nato members will have to reconsider staying in the pact vs. joining new one with russia . 
  the more this crisis lasts the more it seems to me that putin is probing nato , and the famous article 5 . 
  and currently i 'm prone to believe that bringing down mh17 was a part of that probing . 
  i think we should create euro-force and become a partner to us , instead of hiding under the latter 's skirt . 
  not that i dislike us nor do i believe that us will abandon europe immediately after shtf . 
  but i think that it would be easier to understand and to justify help to a force that is equal , instead of one that needs parenting . 
   putin did say that kazakhs did n't have a sovereign statehood before the soviet union this part i never get . 
  why should the collapse of ussr be any kind of demarcation line for the statehood of certain countries ? 
  there are some nations that did n't exist before the collapse . 
  i wo n't name them , because i do n't want to shame them i would just want to say to putin : so what ? 
  they did n't and yet now they are ; deal with it . 
  also , consider that to try `` justify '' your country 's existence to satisfy putin 's logic is pointless . 
  logic only serves putin as a smoke screen for military bullying . 
  you will never win an argument with him , because he treats his army as an actual rhetorical figure . 
  and we should n't follow his line of reasoning , because it is false while following it gives it credibility . 
  the collapse of ussr is not a demarcation line for international borders , no one needs to prove anything to have a country . 
  to me the matter is simple : you have a nation , you have a country , it exists , it 's on un , then hands off . 
  putin is not international judge of countries ' right to exist , he 's a revisionist . 
  during crimean crisis , he said to one of ukrainian pm 's that there is n't any kind of ukrainian territorial integrity , since ukraine did n't leave the ussr in compliance with the latter 's law . 
  maybe so , but hate is directed towards the enemy , not humanity itself . 
  i mean , in 60 's mad meant that both sides fire missiles and both sides lose . 
  but today we know that you * ca n't * win a nuclear war . 
  even if you somehow destroy/evade/dodge enemies ' missiles and yours hit , you 'll be dead in half a year anyway and the world will turn into radiating desert . 
  even if you survive in bunkers for the time when the surface is survivable or even habitable again , there 's no economy , there 's no civilization and you 're back to the early agriculture . 
  and there 's like 2 % chance to pull this off . 
  while it would make sense for some religious zealot who wants to bring down the civilization , i do n't think even putin 's polls would withstand that scenario . 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying let 's disregard 1600 russian nukes . 
  so they would need very tall tanks , these are expensive - as you might imagine - so they ca n't afford them , hence they cut the army down . 
  it all suddenly makes sense . 
  10/10 would run away like hell d : ~ ~ what are these meshes for ? ~ ~ nvm , found answer below , 
  above 20-30 operational missiles there 's really no point in bragging . 
  20 missiles are enough to wipe out even russia from maps ( especially that it 's rather sparsely populated , and population is concentrated ) ; it is probably also enough to trigger worldwide doom scenario . 
  if anyone , anywhere is ready to push through the nuclear scenario , saying `` x is ours or there 's no one left '' he should be hospitalized . 
  what gain can anyone get from destroying the world ? 
  where will be putin selling oil/gas if he destroys the markets that are buying it ? 
  ca n't eu and us just regulate the matter bilaterally , so that both sides wo n't be able to utilize data stored by the companies based in one of them and operating in the other ? 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh4f-riqifc&amp;t=3m26s ) is a video with cars honking . 
  look out for high volume levels !, 
  i guess the fear is the intended reaction .
