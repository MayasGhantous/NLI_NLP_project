  ukrainian army has serious logistic problems , but still could probably steamroll the area clean . 
  but then you 'd have like 200:1 civilian to militants death count . 
  edit : besides . 
  the separatists have introduced some rudimentary quasi-governmental structure , which you can not simply bomb out . 
  you need to first secure or contain the area and pull the illegal ( from the point of view of ukrainian law ) structures using law enforcement . 
  and not very distinctively male name either : sadness : thanks for the data , 
  can you name your son v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen ? 
  this is badass name . 
  federation means that the associated parties are self-ruled and somewhat autonomous . 
  decentralization means that there are no parties , but lower levels of executive branching are self-managed - have bigger budgets to deal with most of the problems at hand , without the need to go through the central government . 
  well , we can always inflict some losses on their gdp by choosing european counterparts . 
  of course only until they will come to a conclusion that even one person of us ancestry employed in a company makes it a subject to us law . 
  on a business level , us is doing exactly what russia is doing in ukraine and was earlier in georgia , making an incursion using compatriots as meat shields . 
  and i guess it will work for us based companies just as well as it did for people in so called donetsk republic . 
  not only to streets but to remote locations too and in such a coordinated manner . 
  the `` determination '' comes to mind . 
  would never happen in poland . 
  we would begin to squabble over which direction to face :d, 
  apparently they want a monopoly . 
  i 'm not saying all were happy about it , no one complained , no one plead , no one protested . 
  i 'm only saying one man took action . 
  but this is only a shortcut , so let me rephrase that : i have n't heard of anyone else taking any action . 
  and it 's not about the measure being so drastic - i do not expect heroism of everyone . 
  and in czechoslovakia people were actively opposing . 
  over a hundred died , half a thousand was wounded . 
  couple hundred thousand people emigrated . 
  oh my god , norway , what is this dog-like horse-sized monster ? 
  indeed . 
  only [ one man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryszard_siwiec ) in the whole country stood against it . 
  hum ... but do you rather eat indoors or outside ? 
  i 'm wondering about the experience . 
  i have to try ice cream outside next winter . 
  i hope you do n't randomly approach women with this phrase :d it could prove painfull , poles are pretty protective of their women in general . 
  why ? 
  so then why if i would burn any national flag other than polish i would cause a diplomatic dissent ? 
  and i would n't if the flag was polish . 
  i mean , to some extent i agree - on a logical level . 
  there 's no point saying `` we '' if it 's related to ancient history , when `` we '' was not even defined . 
  also , it makes no sense , to say `` we '' as if someone was accountable for the actions of the collective . 
  but then , why do we even assume those national flairs here ? 
  my point is , you 're fighting on a logical level with something that is irrational in it 's roots . 
  and you ca n't really expect people to stop identifying with collective entities . 
  it 's their right to feel the way they feel . 
  of course this right ends when you start shaming other people because of their nationality , different then yours , or telling them how shitty their countries are , because they are n't yours . 
  but unless this line is crossed , i have no problem with people saying `` we '' . 
  i always say `` we invaded czechoslovakia in 1968 '' , because i feel very strongly about this , and despite it not being even remotely my fault ( born in ' 86 ) , i am deeply ashamed for this as a person of polish ancestry . 
  with the last point i agree . 
  we are just a bunch of dorks :p, 
  i 'll show off my ignorance , but ca n't you breed shrimps inland ? 
  these are called mild-conservatives :p, 
  is that a receipt next to the lunch there ? 
  do you have to buy your food in hospitals ? 
  nah , you ca n't say that . 
  `` orient '' is european construct , meaning turk-ish/middle eastern-ish/indian-ish/sine-ish / japan-ish all at the same time . 
  i remember being at museum on exposition dedicated to deconstruction of the term . 
  there were paintings there with information on actual origin of inspiration . 
  and some of them had like 12 sources , going from turkey to korea , despite being called `` oriental '' by creators . 
  all in all , i stand corrected and acknowledge the castle is not turkish in inspiration or style . 
  i did not mean to disrespect too . 
  all i 'm trying to do is to say that i 'm ignorant in the matter . 
  european . 
  but i still feel very strong about poland . 
  i am federalist , but i would n't want this * heimat * of mine to simply dissolve . 
  as i like the fact that people from warsaw differ from those from cracov , gdansk or olsztyn . 
  but then again sometimes i feel more a slav than anything else . 
  so i guess it 's complicated :d, 
  whenever i see something vaguely `` oriental '' ... 
  i 'm aware there was n't ever any orient and it 's just colonial construct ; still it 's usefull when you ca n't pin point the location :p but anyway , anything vaguely `` oriental '' brings me turkey to mind . 
  i guess because you and us were bestests of friends :333 but seriously , i can barely make a distinction between turkish and indian architecture . 
  educate me if you dare , 
  or they think it 's bigger and has second part in the name ? 
  i guess that answers op 's question :d, 
  there are people who lie and there are people who are misinformed or confused . 
  i never heard of any reputable historian , who would claim what ylu wrote . 
  to clarify , i 'm not against correcting people who are mistaken or oversimplify - this is part of learning experience after all and i believe people should friendly educate each other ( and i include myself among those who need that education ) . 
  i just do n't expect people to care about something that is our internal business . 
  if they care - that 's great , if not - fair enough . 
  why should a frenchman care about poles who were suppressed by their own government , if he can learn the same lesson from the history of la r\u00e9volution ? 
  ( sorry france , first thing that came to my mind ) . 
  in the eastern part you could get away with `` bo\u017ce moj '' . 
  in central/west it 's `` m\u00f3j bo\u017ce '' ( mooy ) . 
  so close enough  about the `` kurwa '' part . 
  yeah , if words were ambassadors [ ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq80iwtoxmi ), 
  to be fair , i wrote `` but '' , did n't i ? 
  maybe that 's just me , but it looks like something rather the turks would have build . 
  this guy 's shadow looks like nuclear one in this setting . 
  creepily delicious . 
  yup . 
  and to the left there 's even a [ monument ] ( http://gdziebylec.pl/img/obiekty/20530/b3b44edf69_thmb800_warszawa_pomnik_de_gaulle_a_3_jpg.jpg ) . 
  edit : confused left and right . . 
  a [ `` bicycle path '' ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65254197/c360_2014-08-16-14-33-26-513.jpg ) in warsaw . 
  would n't want to spoil your fun [ but ] ( http://www.numere-auto.joo.ro/b222pcu.html ) :3, 
   reddit in general has a boner for that fucking goddamned soldier bear no one really cares about in poland ( just ... shut up about it , jesus ) , and the winged hussars - while forgetting the real heroes like the accursed soldiers or solidarity movement . 
  `` soldier bear '' ? 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://kresowiacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mis%203.jpg ) ? 
  if so then yea , i do n't get how it 's so incredible . 
  i only learned it because foreign friend told me . 
  as for the hussars - do n't you hate . 
  it was the best cavalry in the world , in its time , and i 'd argue the best cavalry formation ever ( comparatively ) . 
  they could deliver the blow of heavy formation , while making crazy maneuvers that were barely possible even for lighter formations .
