  what you mean by `` fluent '' ? 
  if so , then most poles are not fluent in polish :-), 
  i assume that if i understand ' \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 ' than i should work from the other side . 
  the second one will be understood by everyone . 
  the first with some good will also . 
  but sometimes ` czerstwy ' as in ` czerstwy dziadek ' is closer to fresh than you think :-), 
  alien pictograms is the only good thing at this project . 
  polan strong , polish strong . 
  but truly - i do n't think that our neighbours except germans and maybe lithuanians have problems with our pronunciation . 
  you will hear that someone is czech , slovak or our eastern neighbour but there will be no problems . 
  ` szcz\u0119\u015bcie ' / ` szcz\u0119\u015bliwy ' from this list is so close to ' \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435 ' / ' \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 ' in russian so they will have no problems with it . 
  check this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_tusk, 
  oh yes , time for the next grandpa from ~ ~ wehrmacht ~ ~ bundeswehr, 
  i tried to find these hizmet activities in poland . 
  and found only http://hizmet-serwis.pl/ - machine tools service . 
  machine tools from turkey . 
  do you think that they are gulenists ? 
  maybe something happened and we need to check news first / s, 
  hey , maybe * he learned it at birthday party : https://vhhbus.de/serviceangebote/kindergeburtstag/, 
  poland fought soviets because as always their invade poland . 
  independent ukraine was a part of a plan . 
  we wanted buffer state between us and `` peace loving '' russians . 
  doubts ? 
  only in russia i think . 
  soviets hand by hand with nazis started ww2 and your propaganda will not change it . 
  i personally think that this is most important voice in this discussion . 
  it shows that we can not find common language with west europeans . 
  they always consider russians and communists as not so bad option as they helped to beat germans . 
  and as current russia tries to do the same politics as their soviet predecessor which also continued tsars imperialism - for our west partners it 's noting wrong as russians will not invade them but only estonia , baltics , poland and so on . 
  it is difference between non-agression pact and plan to joint invasion on common neighbour . 
  soviets with nazis started ww2 in europe in 1939 but after switching sides you are still trying to tell others that war for you started in 1941 which is simply bullshit . 
  it 's not zero knowledge - it is clearly russian propaganda . 
  `` expansion at the expense of soviets '' - if you does n't know about situation than you can consider it is true and that 's their goal . 
  `` annexed austria '' ... guys from austria made a perfect move after ww2 : they named themselfs `` austrians '' not `` germans '' as before , told everywhere that they did n't want to join reich and hitler of course was german . 
  we can laugh at macedonia and their effort to connect with alexander et al , but in case of austria it works perfectly . 
  vienna liberated ? 
  so maybe berlin too ... 
  anti-semitism existed then and exists now but it is n't as widespread ( al least now ) as many of you think . 
  and the last thing : germans killed about 6 millions polish citizens . 
  among them 3 millions were jews . 
  it 's hard to determine how to count them : as jews , as poles , as polish jews etc. 
  some of them felt polish , some jewish , some both . 
  all these people are commemorated on 1st of september . 
  north lane of road was built from the scratch . 
  germany created only south part before the war and until 2000 's it was the only road . 
  now you can drive comfortable to germany , but in reverse direction you should try to look forward and switch lane to less damaged ;-), 
  sugar is bad , in large amounts and combined with fat very bad , but what about aspartam , acesulfame k and so on ? 
  people want sweet and after ban on sugar they will eat other shit . 
  nice map , but it will be interesting if we add maps about speaking in german or french across europe . 
  ergodan in turkey does what he want to do and do n't care about us , nato , eu opinion . 
  and additionally he thinks that he and whole turkey is a puppet state ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  the fact is that eu , nato and so on need turkey more than turkey needs them , so everything can be done : 1 ) where are our 3 billion eur ? 
  2 ) what about visa free travel ? 
  3 ) `` people '' do n't want us base - why are you on our soil ? 
  and so on, 
  thank you for describing russian point of view in this situation . 
  in poland scarves were popular till 80 's . 
  sometimes you can see it now in rural areas , but very rare and worn by older women . 
  and one thing - everyone know that pis does n't support minorities , but this guy lives in poland and his official name is ` algirdas vaicekauskas ' not olgierd wojciechowski . 
  is this posiible in lt to switch name to original polish version ? 
  i do n't exactly know what was changed in law which was banned by duda , but still exist law that : 1 ) gives you opportunity to use your language in administration if you are living on area inhabitated in at least 20 % by minority 2 ) gives you right to use your language system in case of marriage ( everywhere ), 
  in ` talutis ' case it will be ` talutis ' ` talutien\u0117 ' form - in polish talutisowa is used only informally and outmoded now . 
  the same ` talutyt\u0117 ' - our talutis\u00f3wna is strongly old fashioned . 
  the only conversion is mandatory by ' - ski ' ending which is replaced by ' - ska ' , you can also swich ' - ny ' ending with ' - na ' but this is not mandatory . 
  if some woman is married to kowalski but marriage was n't performed in poland she probably will stay kowalski instead of kowalska . 
  i head that the same works in lithuania if woman married to grzybowski does n't want to by grybauskene ( or something similar ) she is performing marriage in poland and she is grzybowska without problems in lt. 
  such workaround . 
  and maybe they want poland going to them ? 
  is this what should be done ? 
  for russians it was . 
  another name for their empire . 
  integration did n't happen as you tried ( with success ) to divide from them . 
  you wanted to learn russian or you were forced to learn ? 
  and i agree poles should learn lithuanian there . 
  there are some many reasons for it , so they should do it . 
  they considered lithuania as a region of poland . 
  why polish national epic starts with `` lithuania , my fatherland ! '' ? 
  about speaking lithuanian - it is correct - they should know it , but speaking polish in its regions should be considered as a `` support language '' as it is common in almost everywhere in eu with local minorities . 
  additionally gerrymandering as botan_tm mentioned is not giving `` bigger benefits '' . 
  so why after living for decades in soviet union you are not integrated with russians ? 
  and you wanted independence ? 
  this is the thing here - there is no talk about e.g. 
  revision of borders and so on as we have great opportunity to live in the same eu house , but it is sensible thing and both side should understand that . 
  after some bad news from france when you see `` car are burn in france again '' you feel `` good old france returned '' ... 
  interesting , when lawn mover racing on ice became too mainstream they invent something new ... 
  russia wants to stir in our common glass and is doing it . 
  if i hear that somewhere ( that was in wilno/vilnius ? 
  - i 'm writing it double to avoid more conflict ;-) ) poles are together with russians against lithuanians then definitely something is wrong . 
  we should check where is the problem and solve it . 
  [ in 1900 it was polish soil ] ( http://www.easternct.edu/germinaveris/files/2014/05/fig-2-1024x653.jpg ) . 
  let people decide how they want to be named . 
  maybe someone could provide maps from 1400 or 1000 ;-) ? 
  i know some germans which lived in polish part of silesia - their names were polonised and after first possibility their children switched to original german names . 
  i understand that you are small nation lived in the shadow of poland but remember : two dogs strive for a bone and the third runs away with it . 
  so i will say one maybe funny thing the main responsible for recalling us ww2 is ... soviet union . 
  even people born in ' 70 , '80 were `` tortured '' with all ww2 stuff in school ( everything learning , events , everything what you can imagine ) , in movies , etc etc. 
  enemy was the only one - big , bad germany ( at those moment west germany ) . 
  soviet union was the good one and nobody could say anything against . 
  the cult of grunwald battle is the one of this things .
