  in fact some ( probably many ) poles were anti-semitic , some of them murdered jews because they want to grab their property ( but i 'm not sure that they have done it for anti-semitic reason or for easy money only - if pole had killed another pole in order to grab his property it is simple crime - if pole had killed jew - it is anti-semitic motivated act ) . 
  i do n't want to whitewash criminals but such statements as `` poles murdered jews '' suggest something more than describing that some criminals committed such things . 
  statement of polish government in exile and underground state was clear : supporting germans in their atrocities against jews was not allowed . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szmalcownik some people ( also here ) really want to say `` hey poles , what about your nazi history '' - there was no nazi history , only individual persons which were condemned be both government in exile and communist regime . 
   that does n't make a lot of sense . 
  to be honest : all actions of germans then did n't make a lot of sense . 
   let me remind you that poles murdered jews after the war in actual massacres because they feared having to return stolen property . 
  and jews murdered poles after the war because they feared that poles will resist new occupation . 
  the same in poland - some add also `` folkswagen '' and `` folfo '', 
  surprisingly you will fit in 500 . 
  there is no place on rear seats and no trunk but on front seat there would be no problem even for ~ 190cm tall people . 
  that was n't overstatement . 
  usually `` only '' entire family was killed by germans but there were also actions when whole village was killed and all buildings were set on fire . 
  it was done for showing others that hiding jews is not a good idea . 
  brutalism has its lovers and haters . 
  should d\u00fcsseldorf be counted as city ? 
   le pen is anti-everything no , no - she is pro-putin and that 's all . 
  nice word play, 
   kurwin it 's intended or just a typo ? 
  orb\u00e1n tries to act as some previous nam leaders . 
  switch from one side to another if this could be better for them . 
  ... and the best vodka . 
  majority of europeans should understand that we can be many times stronger as a simple sum of individual strengths . 
  it 's not the matter that we should follow only one vision but european strength should be high in our priority list . 
  third banana . 
  there are ( were ? ), 
  blue and golden bananas . 
   but that would make sense if there was a better nutella on the shelves . 
  nutella is generally sugar mixed with margarine . 
  it can not be better . 
  if you want to have better food try to do it at home from basic products . 
  in case of nutella-like spreads it is possible . 
  i 'm not expert , but i like e.g this one : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/glass_of_k%c3%b6stritzer_schwarzbier.jpg/220px-glass_of_k%c3%b6stritzer_schwarzbier.jpg, 
  no , no , no . 
  white cheese looks like this : http://www.wrp.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twarog ^ ^ / s, 
  it 's nothing strange . 
  poles are known for overstay in us and to work illegally there . 
  americans have ( or to be more correct had as illegal work in us after joining common market in eu is not so popular as before ) a valid reason not to let all poles in . 
  the problem is that us guys make everything to disgrace persons which apply for a visa ( questions like ` are you a terrorist ' are mandatory to respond ) . 
  the second problem ( in my opinion bigger ) is that there is consensus in poland ( almost all politicians , mainstream media no matter who they support ) that usa is our ally . 
  usa is not our ally , was n't and will not be . 
  $ 160 per person + about $ 6 per giving passport back ( this can be avoided but you have to go to the consulate once again hundreds of kms ) . 
  i have 3 persons family , so the total cost is about $ 500 . 
  for me personally this is the main point . 
  if they want to have these visas , they could have them . 
  but if i think about getting visas , paying us$ 500 , making hundreds kms in order to meet some guy who does nothing ( as visa is granted based on questionnaire sent before this meeting ) i take another destination as holiday trip and that 's all . 
  in this case they want to have the same level of protection in every country in order to avoid `` security competition '' . 
  in poland we have constant discussion about domination of `` culture and science palace '' on warsaw 's landscape . 
  here i see that this building has dominant place in europe also . 
  nothing to compete . 
  your discussion looks like quarrel between brothers who 's mother is the best . 
  i like them both but i 'm vegetables freak . 
  it 's oversimplification about ukrainians . 
  1 ) they do n't return home for the weekend as it it too long journey 2 ) there are many ukrainians but they are still in a minority, 
  whey i ate potatoes in cr for the first time i was surprised about parsley . 
  we serve it with dill : http://bulkazchlebem.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10-936w.jpg, 
   for example , if goldstar decides to produce flat screen tvs in europe , it will build a plant in poland rather than ukraine even if wages are three times higher in poland , because it is far more advantageous to produce inside the single market . 
  they build tvs in europe and yes , it is in poland . 
  economic immigrants - yes , we should let them in . 
  ofc only if they accept our culture . 
  do you think that only english has such phrase as `` half of '' ? 
  i will disappoint you - it 's common in other european languages . 
  the term ` austrian ' describing nation exists on a broad scale only after 1945 so german . 
  but duch was also breath . 
  we use it sometimes as in `` le\u017cy bez ducha '' - `` lays without breath '' . 
  so you are lucky that you did n't end in the same country with these south asia guys from cyprus . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:inglehart-welzel_2015.jpg greece catholic , poland latin america , cyprus south asia . 
  do n't know what they want to show but it 's definitely not cultural map . 
   \u0107 -  basically the same thing as \u010d , a bit softer ( do n't ask why , even we 're not really sure ) it 's simple : \u0107 is \u0107 and \u010d is cz . 
  very easy to distinguish / s, 
  of course there is a difference . 
  slap does n't harm child as much as beating . 
  but it harms so it should be banned . 
  it is also other side of problem . 
  in poland in early 80 's there was a case when small child was regularly beaten by father and mother-in-law . 
  as `` light beating '' or slapping was not considered as something bad in polish society then there was no simply possibility to avoid what happened - child was beaten to death . 
   state ownership of corporations is the preferred model of capitalism now it 's normal thing in these socialist western european countries , so what 's the problem ? 
  everybody knows it . 
  it 's only geographical description . 
  for americans buchenwald and dachau were also polish death camps . 
  do you think that karol tendera does n't know who created these camps ? 
  if people at zdf had a little bit of honour they would state something like ` we used this incorrectly and we are sorry ' on page . 
  now they put some text in picture in order not to be indexed with it by search engines . 
   eventually the polish hairdresser will start earning 20 euros per service just like his german peer , even though his business did n't do much to propell the growth of his country 's economy . 
  every service can propell the growth of economy . 
  it 's only a matter of size and worth ( price ) . 
  productivity is n't independent indicator . 
  it 's connected to gdp , wages , prices etc. 
  as current world economy is based on services it 's meaning is not the same as in industry epoch . 
  simple example : some guy goes to the hairdresser . 
  after 30 minutes polish one gets 20pln , in the same situation german one gets 20eur . 
  who is more productive ? 
  of course german one . 
  what to do in order to have productivity growth ? 
  rise the price - but doing so polish one looses his competitiveness . 
  i remember official polish ads from afair 2015 - we are hard working people with minimum wages so come and use it . 
  no , no , no . 
  ` classic ' potato pancakes are served with sour cream . 
  some people eat them with sugar but it is not so popular . 
  ` hungarian style ' potato pancakes are with goulash alike sauce .
