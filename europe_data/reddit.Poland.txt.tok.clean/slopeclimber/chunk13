  state marriage is not about love , you can still call your loved one your wife/husband even if you do n't have it registered legally . 
  civil marriage exists as an extention of the primary human need of procreation . 
  we should take it back to it roots and make a legal union solely about bringing up children , including the parents and the child . 
  but in some countries it 's so bad that a church marriage has legal consequences ... we still have some time to go , yet people are so stubborn about these things, 
  i agree , some people saw it that way . 
  but as a european personally i would n't feel the effects of tpp very much , so i never took any stance on it . 
   tbf that trade pact was hated by the majority of reddit and their christlike figure bernie sanders and only recently has tpp suddenly become `` not a bad idea '' because trump is against it . 
  people who say that just recognise it as geopolitical tool that greatly benefits america . 
  they do n't really care about middle class americans . 
   considering the pacific alliance between the us , australia , new zealand , singapore , japan , south korea , and the phillipines has made it very clear this sort of thing is unacceptable . 
  what do you mean ? 
  australia and new zealand get along fine with china . 
  and since last year , the philippines as well . 
  not to mention trump hates china so much he cancelled ~ ~ ttip ~ ~ tpp . 
  which in turn makes it far easier to influence their neighbors on the pacific  considering china is taking land in the south china is sea in a disturbingly similar fashion to how russia attacked crimea aside from the fact that both of those were landgrabs ( or seagrab rather ) these are not similar at all . 
   human rights you do n't even have right to life, 
   for example in poland people are pro-eu but they 've chosen a right-wing party ( government ) that does n't have much support from the west . 
  however , it had the support of majority of poles and still has it despite all the drama . 
   they may have gotten a majority in parliament but only 37 % voters voted for them, 
  yeah but no one wants to admit to th ottoman empire, 
  yeah let 's name a country after a dynasty that has been overthrown, 
  i agree, 
  this map is just for state-wide official languages , it 's not like just catalan was excluded, 
   pan european nationalism is indeed a form of nationalism . 
  a good form , uniting europeans against the forces that wish to tear us apart . 
  we desperately need a pan european identity for the youth to fight for , lest they turn towards basic nationalism . 
   is this a troll ? 
   if you are suggesting that different states should votes should have different weights , even though i disagree with it , it can be done without regarding to such a undemocratic method . 
  uhh we already have that in the european parliament , and for a good reason https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament#2014_amendment, 
   then they will border poland , again . 
  check your geography . 
  downvoted for fyrom . 
  yes let 's all dig through others ' post histories and see what we can find . 
  it 's so relevant to this thread . 
  guys , just admit you 're bunch of serbophobes . 
   to reject the notion that banja luka is part of bosnia-herzegovina . 
  you are imagining things . 
  all i see is a nice picture . 
  us has corruption in the form of lobbying corporations . 
  on the other hand in eastern europe the corruption is on more levels and is more direct to the average citizen, 
  not to mention uk has no constitution and the parliament decides on virtually everything, 
  it 's because you elected the * wrong * candidate , therefore your democracy is bad i think that 's the logic behind this reminds me of poland getting lower ranks in the freedom of press index just because pis got to power . 
  yes , the national media are pure propaganda but there 's still a variety of options with a lot of extremes either way, 
  why ca n't the eu do something about this ? 
   belarusian culture is unique ehh i think it 's not that unique , that 's why the country was so easily polonized and later russifed, 
  because watching american politics is like watching some political drama tv show - especially with their outdated institutions like electoral college it makes it better that we are directly not affected because it does n't force us to take sides . 
  in theory our system is decent . 
  it 's the lack of staff and proper ways of financing that 's the biggest problem, 
  uhhh that piece of law is real though, 
  child labor i guess, 
  or janusz christa ... 
  they do n't have to be non-europeans, 
  yeah right , it 's not like they will keep the money themselves, 
  having a child used to be a net zero or a benefit financially several generations ago , now it 's a huge cost, 
  people did the same thing before there were welfare states . 
  they just had to wait for their children to grow up and count on a share of their income, 
  just read his twitter . 
  you do n't even need others to critisize him , he does it himself . 
  or if you wish : https://redd.it/5trnbm, 
  that 's nothing . 
  [ check out what happened in silesia ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ksi%c4%99stwa_%c5%9bl%c4%85skie#ksi.c4.99stwa_.c5.9bl.c4.85skie_z_piastowskim_rodowodem ) . 
  why is dolno\u015bl\u0105skie ( lower silesian ) of germanic-slavic origin , while \u015al\u0105skie ( silesian ) is of just slavic ? 
  yugoslav war songs are the shit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cubcp2wgkyw, 
  i though of him as just a very effeminate guy ... 
  source ? 
  it ignores 1000 years of history in favour of 50 year cold war, 
   obama , on the other hand had nothing but unwavering support for both nato and eu . 
   where were you for his first term ? 
  now that i think about it , american comic books seem like a parody of american stereotypes, 
   in french , obelix is often mistaken for a pun on ob\u00e9lisque ( the monument ) while it actually refers to the `` ob\u00e8le '' , which is the printing term it 's both . 
  why ca n't it be ? 
   no legal difference between village , city or town here , at least not since the revolution see , that 's the differnce . 
  in many countries that distinction is legal and still in use . 
   with a mayor named by the state your mayors are named by the state ? 
  that 's bullshit . 
  lithuania back then was more of a region than a separate country . 
  the lingua franca was polish and many powerful families of the commonwealth resided there . 
  france is still really scummy when it comes to relations with its former colonies . 
  haiti still owes them a 200 year old debt . 
  no thanks , i 'd prefer a eu regulation . 
  town *, 
  poland is 15 times bigger and we also do n't differentiate . 
  probably because historically poland was very rural , and the most powerful state were the landed nobles . 
  no it does n't . 
  it 's pronounced check-ya .

   r\u00e9union wow , did n't realize it was bigger than corsica in term of population, 
  why is it called vilnius and not viln\u00eds ? 
  btw we call you the same thing - bu\u0142garzy, 
  according to un classification austria is western while czechia is not, 
   katana strikes are aimed at joins in the armor : neck , armpit , groin , etc. 
  where there are arteries so that your opponent bleeds out very quickly . 
   same for longswords though, 
  i believe that nuclear power must go along with conventional power . 
  otherwise you get corruptions like russia , which just create great risk to the global order, 
  he did though, 
  i do n't think that just because a couple is together , it deserves some special benefits , like the tax breaks and marriage in itself boils down to reproduction , that 's how it started , why not bring it back to its roots ? 
   so i deducted that you are ok with religious marriage ( was i wrong ? ) . 
  well i 'm ok with it in the way that i do n't care about it unless it breaks the law ( like some quran-derived muslim practices would )  in some countries , religious marriage is fully valid alone , and grants you priviledges that are normally granted only through civil marriage i did n't realize that , sounds like a bad thing, 
  why ?
