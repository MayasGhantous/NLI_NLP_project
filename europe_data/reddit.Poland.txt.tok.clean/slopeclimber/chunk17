  well that 's how it started , people imagine a zombie apocalypse in america whilee the rest of the world realizes that they could be in danger and actually fight a war on their own soil . 
  americans have n't done so since the 1860s . 
  i remember how there was an outrage when they tried to put the football association logo on jerseys a few years back , i had no idea most countries do n't care about such things, 
  if anyone 's wondering , [ this is the real thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg/765px-coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_%281992-1998%29.svg.png )  after the old flag was ruled unconstitutional what does that mean ? 
  but they are free to use it , as the byzantines are gone and the serbs are n't, 
   the byzantine cross it 's called the [ serbian cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_cross ), 
   zombie-apocolypse we 're in europe , not america . 
  you do n't have to invent an imaginary threat like this . 
  it 's called a war . 
  you took it too far . 
  it 's standard in several countries , wish it was more common, 
  see , when you use the one with a roman numeral as the month you can never confuse it with anything else . 
  it means crossaxe . 
   we did not want to beconfused with the polish history of lithuanian nationalism in a nutshell, 
  and can we please start writing the date the best way ? 
  using the system , today would be 27 i 2017 - not even americans are confused, 
  since the 16th century the western european cities grew in size , while polish ones stagnated . 
  with few exceptions like gdansk which was the international gateway in western europe it was in part due to the burghers getting more powerful . 
  this was not the case in poland , where the land magnates stayed in power til the very end of statehood, 
  poland was really rural and sparsely populated compared to the rest of europe though, 
  i love how krak\u00f3w stayed the same size until the 18th century . 
  shame there are n't cities like these nowadays, 
  the hungarian nation is not united because there are areas in slovakia and romania that are several tens of kilometers from the border even they 're majority hungarian, 
  greece is spending 3.5 % despite that, 
  no one is taking about all of transylvania . 
  except you, 
  being allied with the uk would n't be bad if brexit did n't happen  but what you can expect from a party whose foregin minister thinks that san escobar supports it for the un security council ... 
  i hate when people point out gaffes instead of mentioning real problems . 
  yes those exist and need to be pointed out . 
  if gaffes are all you can say about our politicians , then we must be doing pretty good . 
  mentioning those irrelevant things does no good if you want to convince people to your side , not just when it comes to polish politics ... 
  it just makes you look desperate, 
  po is a center right party so it still applies, 
  well they still build monuments of war criminals from oun, 
  and if you consider that poland is slowly improving and ukraine has a frozen war at its border, 
  it 's not supposed to . 
  why do you have to dismiss it like that ? 
  of course it 's a very valid statistic . 
  people in that age range are the most productive to the country 's progress and economy, 
  polanski was never charged with rape . 
  it was for sex with underage person , legally a different thing, 
  why not ? 
  it 's a legitimate stance . 
  well , we 've already had mary as our queen since 1656, 
  [ finland mentioned : ddddddd ] ( http://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/5980421+_4ead7a44ffbd913f4a11f1fe5f615589.png ), 
  check-ya  `` kia '' or `` chia '' ? 
  are n't those two the same when you 're romanian ? 
  not really . 
  in czech , bohemia is \u010cechy and the entire country is \u010cesko . 
  and to add , the latter name is obviously derived from the name of bohemia . 
  blame the eu as well , and vote in the ep elections . 
  the eu is n't an angel . 
  the soviet reunion . 
  could have used these at least https://i.redd.it/tzxasyc858xx.png though it 's still missing the better ones , like eexit for esthonia or oexit for austria, 
  you 're a good troll . 
  i appreciate that, 
  if i only got my knowledge from reddit i 'd think that slovenia has this one lake as an attraction, 
  yeah but there are more polish speakers in ireland than irish , it 's laughable, 
  then would n't staying in the eu make more sense ? 
  singapore is in asean and its trade bloc, 
   irish language it 's dead, 
  legoland is a part of the danish realm , along with greenland , faroe islands and denmark proper, 
   it would be more insane for us than brexit already is . 
  true . 
  people in this sub are so anti-english . 
  i think that 's the only reason why one could think that brexit is bad for britain but scottish independence is good for the scots, 
   that 's just like saying , bosnikas are not an ethnicity , they are just serbs . 
  there 's more truth to that than anyone 's willing to admit, 
   montengerins montan and negran *, 
  do you think that serbia 's good position is an obvious benefit for russians ? 
  then you 're a dummy and voivodina , kosovo , sandzak do n't have any nations unique to them . 
  they could try to separate ( if they wanted to ) but using the national excuse is not the right choice, 
  czechoslovakia was n't dysfunctional in the slightest . 
  even when it split it was because of loud minority, 
  you can get by with russian ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ), 
  you already have ... 
  and there 's already an albania ??? 
  what 's your point, 
  i was speaking of countries that do n't have same sex marriage , as the poster above and that 's not an opinion but a way of looking at facts, 
  * civil * marriage is a privilege not a right . 
  of course spiritual marriage and religious is also a thing though some people forget the difference and think that a relationship is only valid when the state recognises it - which is bullshit . 
  there are more aspects to it . 
  why would germans read those in the first place ? 
  if so , good riddance, 
  the difference is artificial , unless you mean they are allophones of one / x/phoneme, 
  i was talking about how some languages have / x / , / g / , / k / and some have / x / , / \u0263 / , / k / but they 're pretty much the same thing . 
  and how polish orthography cares for the h-ch distinction when it comes to foreign words the same way english does for f-ph, 
  rude, 
  there was never a voiced / h / in polish . 
  we have / g / instead . 
  both h and ch were always pronounced the same . 
  aside from pretentious intelligentsia before the war that is , that made up the distinction out of nowhere . 
  and eastern/cieszyn silesia dialects due to ruthenian/czech influence, 
  why does o it look like the tower of babel ? 
  i 'm serious . 
  do n't downvote . 
  just like there are police officers for reviewing cheese pizza found in a pervert 's computer a dream job for a pedophile, 
  it 's way below the replacement rate . 
  unless you want a society with more pensioners than workers . 
  i bet there is a soviet statue in tallinn about that,
