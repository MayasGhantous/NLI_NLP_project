  english does n't have this sound , do you really expect people to learn them to learn one sound for a foreign language, 
  why not korolevets ? 
  not a country unless you want to count asturias and galicia as well, 
  i fucking hate how the innocent pepe meme became associated with dumb politicians, 
  calm down, 
  go read about propaganda campaign that started under the adenauer government . 
  the thing is , warsaw and krakow are both in * kotlina * , a deeper place surrounded by taller ground from all sides, 
  every one in this thread is taking any how gdp is a bad way to measure wealth . 
  that 's not really the problem here . 
  the source of confusion comes from the fact that you ca n't compare a sovereign nation with a national subdivision , even if it is autonomous to done extent, 
  how about we prioritize the interests of europeans over of migrants and let 's not fool ourselves -- germans may think they found the solution but it 's just the one that strokes their ego and does n't solve the problem, 
  you really should, 
  do n't be silly , of course he meant the literary languages, 
  i was more talking about the double plus good stuff . 
  orwell thinks these kinds of phrases are inferior, 
  orwell 's idea of how language works is so uneducated , as shown by 1984, 
  maybe atheists have less children and so some of them chose not to answer ? 
  pretty sure mount olympus is not in the balkan mountains, 
  that 's not true . 
  nato 's article 5 does n't work everywhere on the planet . 
  i hate his peacemongering attitude . 
  britain never held all these territories at the same time, 
  who else thought it was a bear for russia , from the thumbnail ? 
  why is nicolas ii considered a saint in russia ? 
  this is so bizarre, 
  how about you read the article ? 
  also it just makes sense for legal reasons . 
  i 'm not saying it should . 
  i 'm just saying that the law is n't for distinguishing good and bad things . 
  the law is not the ultimate authority on good and bad things . 
  so during the colonization era spain and portugal were not european ??? 
  in english they 're called doctors without borders but the acronym is still msf . 
  how is russia not european, 
  silly continentals , thinking they are safe from robot domination, 
  similarly , pollack used to be a normal word for polish people in english . 
  now it 's pejorative . 
  [ the heptarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heptarchy ) [ the kingdom of the isles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_isles ) [ the shape of the continent itself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/suponmp.jpg ), 
  because grrm has no sense of scale, 
  it 's based on the [ kingdom of the isles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/kingdom_of_mann_and_the_isles-en.svg/1297px-kingdom_of_mann_and_the_isles-en.svg.png ), 
  just because you choose to believe old stereotypes does n't mean they 're true . 
  do n't link the np.reddit.com version https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/6rvusy/is_the_military_worship_of_the_spartans_really/, 
  fuck me they need to introduce campaign limits in the us . 
  i would n't care but this spills worldwide and lasts for 2 years . 
  north/south/east / west/central does n't have to correspond exactly with the geographical center of europe . 
  it 's such a silly point , i do n't know why people say that . 
  usa has clearly defined south/midwest etc regions yet no one argues about the definition . 
  look at the map of europe . 
  of course it matters . 
  northern prussia should have been given to the jews . 
  would cause much less problems than it did in palestine . 
  it 's like those things are totally unrelated and not in any way contradictatory, 
  queen of canada does n't have to be the same as the queen of england, 
  the 123 year gap ? 
  no legal matters would survive that long for it make sense for plc to even have a successor . 
  yeah but why ? 
  european union is a good name . 
  why not ? 
  if a federalization happens , nation-states in it will be obsolete anyways . 
  we can turn them into something efficient and more fair . 
  it will be called the european union, 
  i 'm in favor of a european federation , but not with current nation states as it 's subjects . 
  if the eu was to federalize , countries should split and exchange territories so that no state is bigger than 15-20 mln in population . 
  what a shitty argument . 
  how about you address the points he made ? 
  i do n't know a bit of dutch yet i can instantly recognize it written . 
  they 're not touching a bit of the primeval forest . 
  good thing they are not cutting out the primeval forest in the protected areas , then ? 
  misandry in action, 
  you 're delusional, 
  contact / u/116q7qm about it then, 
  adjusted for inflation, 
  but czechs drink beer , not spirits, 
  and they 're desynced at that - december is 12th ? 
  wtf is this ? 
  well russia is less cooperative at the moment, 
  what even is en marche ? 
  do you always have parties that support the president winning ? 
   centre-centre what the fuck is that, 
   poland was given german territory after ww2 . 
  that was your reparations . 
  and even more land was taken away , a net loss . 
   in addition poland currently gets a metric shit-ton in money from the eu every year those funds are completely unrelated to what i 'm talking about . 
   money which frankly should be cut given the chronic financial situation in much of europe , while poland gets given free money to elect a nutcase government and shit on the union courtesy of western taxpayers . 
  you 're welcome by the way . 
  listen to yourself . 
  your comment is in the spirit of the narrative of `` eastern europe not being completely submissive to the western nations despite getting literally free money from them '' that 's too common on this sub . 
  ut 's such an uneducated and toxic point of view . 
   why should german taxpayers today , who were not even alive during ww2 , give you free money , when you were n't alive during the war either ? 
  what does being alive have to do with this ? 
  while most of the people may be dead , the state of polish economy and infrastucture can still feel the consequences of the ww2 . 
  it 's not like we can pretend it did n't happen . 
  the cultural heritage is also lost . 
  all those things are what reparations are for . 
  it 's not just about the people being alive or not . 
   theocratic government calling for the destruction of the jews , hanging gays from cranes , and seeking to eliminate the baha'i community same goes for saudi arabia . 
  the difference is that iran does n't support all those terrorist organisations who have been the west 's problem for a while . 
  it 's definitely being used as a diversion but i do n't see how the calls for reparations are invalid . 
  inb4 `` but eu funds '', 
  [ it 's accurate in poland .
