  [ finally i have an excuse to post this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u92530c.png ) context : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battles_of_the_isonzo, 
  seems to me that it 's incompatible with the libert\u00e9, 
  it 's a silly comparison nevertheless . 
  parisian french is in no way endangered . 
  it 's by far the biggest language in france and would be even if there was n'tnot for the oppression of minority languages in the 19th century . 
  finland does well with its swedish minority , slovakia with its hungarian , italy with its million dialects . 
  belgium is doing great , so is uk , other than brexit . 
  but brexit was not related with culturocide,

  actually i was wrong , if entering is the same as searching . 
  i 'm not sure if it is .

  this is the content i expect to see from / r/europe, 
   while no one gives a fuck in france just look at russia . 
  everybody in the world is telling how their country is corrupt and undemocratic . 
  while no one in russia gives a fuck . 
  perfect logic . 
  outdated concept . 
  only causes antagonism in modern europe for minorities, 
  white - council of europe members grey - non-members of the council of europe, 
  because no trees will be cut out in the actual primeveal part of the forest . 
  just in the surrounding . 
  why do you speak about breaking any laws ????? 
  i 'm clearly talking about a system that would be implemented in law, 
  i 'm not talking about antagonism , just a different mechanism of their creation, 
  what do you think about municipality groups that are voluntary and `` grass roots '' ? 
  as in , not created by the central government but by the local self governments, 
  ideally yes but smaller units have smaller budgets, 
  in all honesty , if europe ever becomes a federation , i 'd like to see europe transform , ditching the current nationstate model . 
  i 'm talking about dividing into more states , ideally no bigger in population than 15 mln . 
  according to that estonians were not integrated in swedish/russian empires, 
  what if it was n't russians that arrived 70 years ago but instead peoples that are native to the land because they 've been there for hundreds of years ? 
  actually in the british house of commons there are too few seats for everybody to fit . 
  they made it a default sub in european countries the number is inflated due to this . 
  realistically it 's much smaller but still in hundreds of thousands, 
  in france, 
  back then , / r/europe had just 30 000 subscribers, 
  i 'd be surprised if it had any form of marriage,

  [ there was a minor shitstorm surrounding it a couple years back . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sejm_cross ) i personally do n't see what the fuss is about . 
  if there was one deputy of a minority religion that wanted to have his symbol right next to the cross , i 'd have nothing against it, 
  we 've got 460 deputies for 38 mln people - so it 's about 20 % more representative than the dutch parliament , in theory when it comes to raw numbers,

  the meeting hall was constructed between may 1925 and march 1928 , designed by kazimierz sk\u00f3rewicz . 
  except for the belgian marble used to cover the inner walls , all other construction materials originate from poland . 
  the oak armchairs , tables and the balustrade were made according to the drawings of architect stefan sienicki , and the bas-reliefs on the balustrade separating the bureau from the amphitheater were designed by aleksander \u017burakowski . 
  the outer wall of the meeting hall is decorated with a frieze composed of eighteen stone plates with bas-reliefs made by jan biernacki and jan szczepkowski , symbolising inter alia : liberation , craft , religion , fine arts , plowing , the press and education . 
  the meeting hall is the seat of the sejm , the national assembly , observing joint sejm and senate meetings , and the location of where the oath of the newly elected president of the republic of poland is held,

  why is this being downvoted ?

  why do you assume eugenics are bad ? 
  could you at least explain your opinion ? 
  was the law actually in use up until 2001 ? 
   i mention basic facts about electoral systems yes that 's precisely why you 're being downvoted . 
  not because you 're making ridiculous and biased logical leaps to prove your point . 
  yes you had to , because what / u/lanson15 said is indeed true http://www.green-x.at/rs-potdb/4-2.jpg,
