  but that was almost 20 years ago . 
  things chaned obviously . 
  on a smaller scale . 
  people in v4 disagree with the quotas because they see them as ridiculous and detached from reality . 
  is this not enough ? 
  how is serbia hostile ? 
  nation states were a mistake . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premier entirely correct . 
  why ? 
  because it exposes your faults ? 
  like not accepting basic human right of giving citizenship to the people ? 
  soviets did . 
  stalin had the final word there . 
  poland 's borders and population exchange was done from moscow . 
   and she appoints the person most likely to command confidence in the house of commons , which can only be the leader of the largest party or anyone from the leading party . 
  why not ? 
  or an independent person that 's good at governing . 
  and is it required for the members of cabinet and the pm to be in the parliament ? 
  leader of the largest party in the parliament automatically becomes the prime minister ? 
  no voting or anything ? 
  i have trouble beleiving this is a part of the legal system . 
  how is the cabinet and the pm chosen in the uk ? 
  here it 's done through the president . 
   members of the pzpr should have been barred for life from ever holding office , no matter their competence . 
  to me , it 's like letting nazis hold office after ww2 . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's not like membership in pzpr was that exclusive , especially after the '70s . 
  turns out he was n't that much of a soviet fan anyways - after all he was the one to allow americans to build their secret cia prisons and am i the only one to think his career in prl was n't significant enough to ban him ? 
  that 's an interesting url, 
  we refer to it as ` ball ' - * pi\u0142ka * or as ` leg ' - * noga . 
  * poetry . 
  it is somewhat true . 
  especially if by * more free * you also mean lack of regulations like copyright or less labor protection . 
  why mention tyrol speciffically and not german moravia and german bohemia ? 
  yeah but i 'm talking about that romanian reactions are not justified and it 's not like hungarians want a border along the carpathians . 
  they are also much smaller so it 's easier for them . 
  they have a right to be upset . 
  [ the borders were n't drawn fairly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/hungarians_in_romania.svg/1100px-hungarians_in_romania.svg.png ) . 
   but you do n't see us bitching endlessly about it , spamming maps of greater romania all over the place , starting shit with ukraine , refusing to call chernivtsi or bilhorod-dnistrovskyi by their current names , etc. . .  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/hungarians_in_romania.svg/1100px-hungarians_in_romania.svg.png ) and [ this is why . 
  ] ( http://www.americanhungarianfederation.org/images/ethnic_map_slovakia1910-1991.gif ) look at all those hungarian majority areas right next to the border . 
  you ca n't seriously believe this is something other than a punishment . 
  austria got a chunk of hungary after the war . 
  yet some lithuanians claim there 's no way belarus is a successor state to gdl . 
   plc was so progressive it gave each prince/whatever menber of parliament actually . 
  yes . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
   if you have ukrainian passport and getting new citizenship - you 're obligated to write to consulate of ukraine and lay off your ukrainian citizenship . 
  practically nobody does that . 
   yeah , same thing here . 
  nobody cares in practice . 
  there are plenty people with dual citizenship even though t 's technically illegal . 
   poland itself , for example a noble family was considered wealthy in mazovia if they had more than 5 villages mazovia is a bad example , it was always the poorest region, 
   it 's the rule of 3 generations though . 
  give it another 10 or 20 years so old turds who keep voting for the same folks since the soviet times will die off , next generation will definitely be more cooperative and more open towards progress . 
  you 'll have to hope that the next generation of ukrainians and its children in poland will retain the citizenship - it 's the young people that move out . 
  i agree . 
  but we 're not really cooperating with the state itself enough . 
  it could be a major market for our companies and vice versa , it 's 40 million people on both sides . 
  yeah but how is that comparison valid ? 
  sweden had colonies , denmark , even courland for a short time . 
  if poland could mobilize and focus on that , it could realistically work . 
  the country was rich enough . 
  austria hungary was created in mid 19th century so i do n't know how that was relevant . 
  and prussia was a polish vassal state . 
  well the `` sarmatian '' mentality was pretty much the same as of modern ` murricans . 
  loving freedom above all else , being ignorant , conservative and selfish . 
   with this kind of system it does n't really matter where you go , east or west it mattered when you have magnates who were richer than some princes in the west ( [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/%d0%97%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%bb%d1%96_%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%96%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%9f.png ) ) - and such thing was only possible with the expansion to the east . 
  i think we are not doing enough to help ukraine and belarus , actually . 
  it 's in our best interest to have them as close friendly partners . 
  they should be to us as we are to germany . 
  i should have clarified i meant refeudalisation in the commonwealth . 
  what were western european countries doing at the same time ? 
  busy colonising and slowly urbanising . 
  and poland was much more rural at that time than other countries . 
  the biggest city at that time was gda\u0144sk , and only becuase it was a major port to the rest of europe . 
  with 60 thousand population , far ahead of any other city in poland . 
  not all nobles - mostly magnates . 
  and most of those had their lands in the east . 
  [ this map speaks for itself ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/%d0%97%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%bb%d1%96_%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%96%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%9f.png ) it 's because of magnates [ who were literally princes in their own land ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c5%84stwa_magnackie ) - and at the same time oligarchs . 
  these were the ones that only cared about themselves , had great superiority complex and they were rich enough to bribe poor masovian noblemen to have them vote for whatever they wanted . 
  actually the 1569 transfer of southern ruthenia to k. of poland was a major mistake . 
  thanks to this , rich nobles from there were abvle to get into the polish political system . 
  this in turn slowed down the progress and poland never really got out of the agrarian way of life, 
  even one terrorist attack is too much . 
  they are completely avoidable . 
  i do n't think there has been a single terrorist attack in poland since wwii . 
  it 's not about the number of people killed either . 
  that 's not terrorism is about . 
  a terrorist attack is defined by the intention behind it . 
  that map in the bottom right corner is misaligned in the republic 's south . 
  not under those names , but yes . 
   sadiq khan regrets that tweet `` terrorist attacks are part of daily life in a major city , we have to accept that . '', 
  or something like that, 
   aggresive foreign policy eu is far more aggressive than china, 
  what a cunt . 
  could n't she really put it another way ? 
  or is it a part of the official tory lingo ? 
  why ; _ ;, 
   battle of grunwald what does the lithuanian name for it mean ? 
  no , what you said is entirely correct .
