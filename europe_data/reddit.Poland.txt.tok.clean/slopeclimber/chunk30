  nigel farage did n't speak for may . 
  what are you talkign about ? 
  he might be overreacting with the comparison but he issue is major and it needs to be fixed by the eu . 
  i do n't like your attitude . 
  `` you 're in the union , now shut up '', 
  holy shit that thumbnail . 
   modern day ukraine is also a puppet state of poland i wish , at least they 'd stop worshipping genocidaires . 
  and kunda in esthonia, 
  it 's still very recent and i say that as someone who was n't even alive back then, 
   because they were afraid of the real nazis of voat . 
  voat citizens did n't want any refugees . 
  polish sejm building was built in 1925-28 . 
  back when speer has n't even statred working . 
   lemon in beer is n't exactly something new . 
   proceeds to name a recent date, 
   it 's not too corporate looking ( ... ) , not over the top ( ... ) you 'll love the polish lower house then : [ 1 ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/1200/0/newsweek/635840788036414259.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.strzyzew.gminalukow.pl/sejm6_1549x1037.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/zji7mda_/fda75d344c4ca1037f199d47d8f2ec14.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/20070124_sejm_sala_plenarna.jpg ), 
  they can unite them though , it 's not a problem, 
   neomarxism are you fucking serious, 
  i 've never seen a czech complain about tschechien , chequia , tcheqie or \u0427\u0435\u043a\u0438\u044f though . 
  it 's the same thing . 
   np.reddit link do n't allow people to vote on the comment or comment on it not true . 
  it 's a simple css hack that does n't even work if you have res, 
  i swear , only czechs have a problem with the name ` czechia ', 
  europe is arbitrary , eurasia is n't, 
  that just means they should fix them, 
  all i 'm saying is , countries should be judged by their worst . 
  all of them . 
  that 's not what capitalism means . 
  china is very capitalist , where have you been since 1979 ? 
  or just because there is a unified currency without unified fiscal system , which is ridiculous . 
   but pis changed that and used crisis to their advantage i do n't think that 's necessairly true . 
  no one voted for pis because of their stance on euro . 
  yeah , it 's a shithole but only when you 're a gypsy !, 
  no need to worry about them !, 
   not according to the americans , who claim a constitution is a single governing document the laws in thse 6 books are a part of the same legal process . 
  how is that any different from us constitution having ammendments ? 
  plenty of them ? 
  holding dearly to some irrelevant islands that you have no claim to just for the sake of it is exceptionally pathetic . 
  sad . 
  why do you think so ? 
  is it because he 's charismatic ? 
  there 's an ocean of difference between a second language and a native language . 
  do n't be silly . 
  and it had widespread support in both countries . 
  i 'm not talking about the rigged referendum here , bear in mind . 
  why would n't i think that ? 
  american influence has been the strongest in europe since the mid century . 
  never heard about this little thing called wwii ? 
  of course i realize austria is over a thousand year old . 
   those anglo-saxons you speak of are as much of a minority now as they were in the 19th century , with all the irish and italians and germans and jewish immigrants . 
  and yet you 've managed to assimilate all of them , and no longer see them as ` other ' . 
  it has n't hurt american culture -- on the contrary , we have pizza now . 
   the only thing remaining of these are surnames and nothing else . 
   language , i also kind of get , even though for younger generations , native language is going slowly out of use and within one or two more generations we 'll likely see an english speaking europe no way . 
  is this in austrian german ? 
  austria was forcefully separated from the rest of germany . 
  the rest of countries have just been there long enough . 
  per ten thousand ? 
  did n't even think about that . 
  i should have changed to something like grayscale, 
  so why did he shave ?

   source ? 
  look at the duplicate page . 
  holy shit montenegro, 
  funny how someone playing sports at 45 would be considered ancient, 
  how do you know ? 
  those are two different issues . 
   so , this is what the english press releases of the foreign ministry look like now , as checked by actual english teachers . 
  oh come on now . 
  you have all those things this government fucks up and you pick some irrelevant bullshit . 
  not to mention these notes by `` actual english teachers '' are mostly nitpicking and the text is already 95 % correct . 
  ask any english speaker and he 'll tell you that . 
  nah , sanders is too much of a socialist . 
  and he wasnt attacked by trump so you have no idea how it would go . 
  how is this relevant to this article ? 
  why is this being downvoted ? 
   it 's like asking why austria and germany did n't unite they did but later they lost the war . 
  it was due to external forces that the union did n't last . 
  unification was favored by the population but not allowed . 
   attempt to break up their national unity well they were supposed to strenghten the yugoslav nationality which made sense . 
  if germans , italians , spanish could do it , why not southern slavs ? 
  why not return to the old ones where pretty much everyone was mixed ? 
  what i still do n't understand is why did they choose those ancient internal borders after wwii . 
  they 're ridiculous . 
  who did he mass murder ? 
  no i 'm pretty sure nobody on earth is 170 years old, 
  our previous government that poland would become a second ireland . 
  turns out ireland is becoming a second poland, 
   just because our ancestors from about 5 to 10 generations ago were cunts people still remember the bengal famine, 
   yes , my ancestors paid the price you do n't give 2 shits about your ancestors from thousands years ago . 
  why is lithuania the only country so far ? 
  i do n't understand, 
  no one is homophobic enough to want to prosecute people , it 's an absurd comparison, 
  i assume it 's cheaper to buy a place in the basement than on the ground floor, 
  terrorists win . 
  actually it 's from vrh as far as i can see, 
   vr\u0161je i think you 're going too far . 
  that part is for ` vrh ' . 
  and it 's just softened as it should be .
