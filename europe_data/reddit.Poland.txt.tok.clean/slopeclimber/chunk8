   the glagolitic alphabet, 
   like nasalized \ua657 , \u0465 \ua657 , \u0465 are not nasal . 
  i hate it . 
  it looks like a giant mess and the alphabets look always like ones that had russian in mind first and not their own language . 
   til the cyrillic alphabet was actually developed by someone named cyril . 
  that 's not true . 
  it was named after him . 
  well how else would you mark them as soft without a soft yer ? 
  they are not diphthongs , the 're digraphs . 
  same with the vowel ones . 
  diphthongs are a phonetic phenomenon , they have nothing to do with orthography . 
  haha this is exactly what he found funny we poles know out consonant clusters so it 's not a problem - we have things like l\u015bni\u0107 or wstrz\u0105s ( do n't worry , rz is a digraph '', 
  so it 's just badly explained on this website ? 
  the primary meaning of soft consonant in slavic languages is always a vowel that palatalises the preceding consonant . 
  russian \u0418 does n't sound like [ ji ] at the beginning of words but it 's still a soft vowel . 
  yeah but in polish there are soft ia/ie/io / iu/i/i \u0105 / i\u0119 and hard a/e/o / u/y / \u0105 / \u0119 so i assummed ukrainian i would be soft, 
  it 's called rubble for a reason, 
  that 's not an explaination . 
  i 'll go look on my own to see the history of ukrainian then, 
  is n't the additional line in g also a diacritic ? 
  i know , my question still stands, 
  \u0451 is a letter that used to be just e but the sound mutated in some enviroments and they decided to put dots over it to mark the sound change . 
  \u0439 from the beginning was a letter to symbolize the [ j ] semivowel . 
  they were n't that creative so they thought the best way would be to put a breve over the letter of the closest sound out there , \u0438 . 
  if you say \u0439 is not a separate letter you might as well say j or g is n't . 
  though i admit i really do n't like this letter . 
   and by shape : cyrillic k is different from latin/greek k. not much , but konsistently over designs : it is . 
   only in serif fonts , and even then only in some of them . 
  so for this chart 's it 's fine to mark as comon to all three . 
   also , adding russian yo ( e with diaeresis ) is conceptually wrong . 
  diaeresis is a diacritic ; the short mark on i kratkoie too . 
  i agree about \u0451 but not about \u0439 . 
   ... 6 hard vowels ...  \u0410 \u0415 \u0418 \u0406 \u041e \u0423  ... 4 soft vowels ( explained later ) ...  \u0404 \u0407 \u042e \u042f wait what ? 
  i is a hard vowel ? 
  this would get complicated as it depends whether you use roman or italic type . 
  and even without that you have to choose if you 're gon na represent bulgarian or russian cyrillic as they have different shapes . 
  bulgarian would be better fit for that sort of chart . 
   cyrillic `` c '' developed from lowercase greek sigma ( \u03c2 ) , etc wrong . 
  [ old cyrillic ] ( http://learn.bdfoto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/img244-1.jpg ) is based on [ uncial greek ] ( http://www.katapi.org.uk/images/g&amp;lpalaeography/g&amp;lpalaeography11-157c.jpg ) . 
  and there was greek majuscule at the time that used c shape for sigma . 
  cursive greek came later, 
  you do n't even recognize the genocide though and what country in europe still worships nazi puppets ? 
  how exactly does that count as fighting for independence ? 
  not to mention far more ukrainians were a part of red army and you only glorify them because you can ', 
  so why are genociders glorified ? 
  we need to `` invade '' the war troubled countries , take a piece of them and take care about the people there . 
  it sounds bad but if we did that in syria it 'd be much more effective and humanitarian than german way of helping which mostly serves their egos and human traffickers , not the syrian country and people, 
  why do you assume africa will progress ? 
  with the enviromental problems and overpopulation it might not . 
  and to large degree it depends on global powers if they take care of them . 
  if they stay geopolitically irrelevant they may stagnate . 
  that hat ... 
  show me one country ruined by too little ethnocentrism , and i 'll show you ten ruined by too much . 
   majority of european countries are based on ethnicity , what are you talking about, 
   i do n't have much interest in their catholic dream . 
  what, 
   poles can discontinue to buy them , forcing them out of the market . 
  no they ca n't . 
  most of the market has been taken over . 
  it 's no that simple . 
  yours is better though than georbachev it 's the correct form of writing as it 's consistently phonotic , ulike english system which writes the [ jo ] letter as < e  for some strange reason, 
  so their ancestors were german ??? 
  i do n't see how that 's a cultural influence yeah most people there call themselves german americans but it only refers to the fact that they had a german great-great-great-grandfather . 
  nothing else . 
  poland has more german influence than the most german state of the us the only valid example would be the amish but they 're obviously not really a part of general american society, 
  yeah look at all this german influence . 
  stop kidding yourself . 
  americans do n't even have german surnames as they all chenged them following ww1, 
   as we are a mix of european cultures which is the basis of `` american culture '' american culture is in 80 % derived from british culture when it comes to european heritage, 
  kind of , yes, 
   linguistically well ... 
   why do you think things like electoral college exist in the us ? 
  it 's precisely because when the us was forming , smaller states wanted to have equal say as the bigger states regardless of how populous they were . 
  nowadays the electoral college seems obsolate because there 's a shared american identity , but back then the situation was different . 
  electoral college is still a great idea for federations . 
  we in europe do similar thing when it comes to allocation of ep seats . 
  though it is outdated in some areas , like the way states give votes using the winner-take-all method which is a spit in the face of democracy, 
  no you pay it everytime you buy something . 
  and when the price tag has a price on it , it already includes the vat, 
  so does that mean they will get deported when the war in syria ends ? 
  how are radom , p\u0142ock and siedlce a part of the capital region ? 
  same warlordship , yes but they do n't have much in common . 
   germany is quite the opposite . 
  the idea of germany is pretty new , 150 years they were still a bunch of blondes dudes with mustachs and weird pants doing barbaric stuff here and there . 
  even tho they were all blondes dudes in tights , it took them a very long time to realize they might be cousins or something . 
  when they realized it , the first thing they did was to invite themself in france . 
  really makes you think, 
  rude, 
  reading how germanics perceive each others ' languages , it makes me glad none of the slavic languages have the so called `` throat sounds '', 
  does buying alcohol in estonia count as an overnight trip ? 
  40 % unemployment , 1/5 of the population is n't happy about being a part of it or even the country existing , they have a eu-appointed official with the powers of a prime minister like a colony, 
  having an old society is n't healthy at all, 
  latvia is the best and the worst in europe at the same thing :d, 
  at this point netherlands joining belgium is looking more sensible, 
  go home juncker , you 're drunk . 
  [ fixed ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rsdqufw36s8/thci7zdkcri/aaaaaaaacvq/8qeyhnqveng/s1600/cats-dogs.0052.jpg ), 
  the same thing happened in italy, 
  just put them into voluntary military service, 
  same, 
  i think you have n't been paying attention .
