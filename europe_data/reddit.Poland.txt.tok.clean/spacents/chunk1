i thought belarus did recognize crimea as a part of russia .

  from what i know there are no syrian refugees wanting to live in poland , they all want to go to germany and other western countries . 
  i see no reason why we should keep them in poland by force . 
  surprised to see turkish name the same origin as france and spain . 
  i think your language is awesome , 
  i expected ukraine to be much higher . 
   also get rid of all the `` head of state '' concept . 
  it 's ok if you want a king/queen , but otherwise it 's redundant . 
  just make junker ( or the `` eu prime minister '' ) the head of state and the head of government . 
  not gon na happen . 
  corporal punishment in school what a freaking medieval . 
  so we can say they would have to czech his nationality first . 
  or rather citizenship . 
  seriously now . 
  they would n't care if you are a eu citizen ( in the us ) . 
  they let most of the eu in but not every eu country . 
  so they still deal with particular eu countries , not the eu as a whole . 
  at least in migration policy . 
  in trade it 's different . 
  they are in the schengen area though . 
   huge it sector , rapidly growing . 
  this is the platform for future ukraine 's success . 
  i remember me and my dad and brother loved to play a fps game called [ codename : outbreak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codename:_outbreak ) , one of the first games by gsc game world . 
  it was a really playable game ( especially considering it was released in 2001 ) with an interesting plot . 
  what i find very interesting and somewhat disturbing is that they mention an event called arab spring ( or arab war , i 'm not sure ) 10 years before an actual arab spring happening . 
  how about you go troll somewhere else ? 
  for me it is n't reasonable to start a fight with every eu country possible . 
  i wonder why they included a little piece of belarus in central europe . 
  you must be really really lucky to shot down a jet fighter with this . 
  i wish we had these in 1939 though . 
  390 years ago ( 28th november , 1627 ) the biggest sea battle of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth against sweden took place . 
  sweden had naval superiority over the baltic sea and navy never played an important role in plc. 
  however , when swedish squadron of 6 ships saw commonwealth 's vessels , the battle began . 
  they overestimated their strength though and soon the polish fleet won the battle , destroying 1 galleon and taking the enemy flagship . 
  on the conquered galleon tigern the swedish admiral nils g\u00f6ransson stiernsk\u00f6ld died . 
  on the same vessel , being on the board of already conquered ship , polish admiral arend dickmann died ( probably from a cannon fire of * pelikanen * ) . 
  the battle had no strategic impact whatsover , but it was a big propaganda success , proving that polish fleet can defeat swedish . 
  read more about [ the battle of oliwa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_oliwa ) . 
  their northern neighbour macedonia has conquered half of asia . 
  ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ ; o, 
  he works for germany , russia , jews , illuminati and san escobar . 
  we should start commenting on farts . 
  actually you forgot poland . 
  it 's funny because almost all the authors of the constitution were poles . 
  if plc had succeeded they would consider him a hero , probably . 
  they took us more land than gave in exchange , as a matter of fact . 
   even later lithuania had the first constitution in europe xd, 
  lithuanian nobility was freely polonizing , not by force . 
  i 'm not good enough in physics to understand this . 
  from what i translated it looks like some kind of greek copypasta . 
  alexander the great was slav !, 
  neither does kopernikus sound slavic to me . 
  but we write kopernik instead . 
  his father was a polish tradesman from krak\u00f3w . 
  tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko as belarussian , copernicus as german ... 
  i 'm dying of laughter . 
  women on average are not less capable . 
  you ca n't know this . 
  my bad, 
  well elephants have bigger brains and they ai n't smarter . 
  women are not dumber than men , they mostly perform better at school than men and they have better language learning capabilities than men . 
  it 's written in the article . 
  i like the building . 
  + + it reminds of the sadder part of our history and maybe serves as a warning as well . 
  lol how are women less intelligent ? 
  i love the brazilian language they speak . 
  whom are you quoting ? 
  thank you , czechs , i guess . 
  probably . 
  fought several wars , lost some land but definitely we were not absorbed . 
  we allied you to fight teutonic order . 
  and that was later than year 1000 too . 
  stop being ignorant . 
  out of all the polish cities only warsaw and cracow have their equivalents in english . 
  danzig , posen , gnesen and breslau are german names . 
  * triggered *, 
  what is that orange line crossing through poland ? 
  and why are polish cities written in german ? 
  [ well i 'm just talking about things that actually happened in baltic states . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-baltics-iduskbn13n0ry ), 
   and remember , the refugee and migrant crisis would have happened regardless of the existence of the european union !, 
   but without the european union , spain , italy , and greece would be dealing with the problem all alone ... instead of having the burden shared among 28 countries . 
  some people call this weird phenomenon `` solidarity '' !, 
  let 's say we put the refugees in all 28 eu countries . 
  should we keep them in these countries by force ? 
  because i have no doubt that they would leave eastern european countries and target only rich western countries like germany , sweden , france . 
  your irony here really fails . 
  eurail is for non-eu citizens/residents i believe ; for those who live in eu there 's interrail . 
  you forgot to add ` german option ' and ` traitor ' and ` criminal ' . 
  hispaania for the wiin, 
  maybe i 'm blind but what do they get ? 
  ignore him he 's trolling . 
  look at the smile at his face . 
  he wants to shock people . 
  it 's always 20 % something in voting to euro parliament . 
  ireland is the only one that receives territory instead of losing it . 
  edit : and hungary apparently . 
  agreed . 
  honestly i did n't think that western europe would to that .
