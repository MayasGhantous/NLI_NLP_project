  do you imagine someone buying mona lisa ? 
  i guess they would n't sell it even if someone would pay a good price . 
  let 's not forget they were naming these five new judges deep at night , being in rush because the tribunal was to give decision the next day ... also they passed a law regarding the work of constitutional tribunal without vacatio legis ( the law came in life immediately after voting ) so that everything what would the tribunal do next was illegal . 
  also now regarding the annual budget law , they passed it in another chamber without informing the opposition , counting the votes by hand and you ca n't be sure if quorum was maintained . 
  we love you guys since 1385 . 
  i actually live in the marked area of poland but never heard of it ... 
  actually holocaust denial [ is a crime in most of the europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ), 
  where do i begin ... 
  i will repeat you that i oppose the current government in poland but i also oppose the obligatory migrant quotas , ** as do most of the eastern eu countries ** and large majority of western countries . 
  that does n't make me a pis supporter . 
  secondly , does it really mean that if it is cold on the north pole , every pole ( what a coincidence ) is brainwashed by pis and orban ? 
  i do n't call muslim and mena people this or that so i ca n't relate . 
  you keep accusing me of things i did in your mind . 
  ok , i lost it when you started about germany shoving quotas down my throat . 
  ca n't fight that logic . 
  if you were talking about baltic air policing , poland does not benefit this ` decision ' . 
  there is no union in harshly imposing things no one wants , like it is with the obligatory quotas . 
  and lastly i called you ignorant on your very simplified vision of poland as a hmm some sort of evil state with brainless people or whatever you think .

  and lastly i called you ignorant on your very simplified vision of poland as a hmm some sort of evil state with brainless people or whatever you think . 
  that is exactly what i was talking about . 
  i do n't agree with you , therefore in your mind i 'm brainwashed by pis and orban . 
  i did n't state anywhere that i support pis or orban and in fact i strongly oppose pis . 
  you 're just pure ignorant . 
  there is no ` my government ' . 
  secondly , talking about eu migration policy i was talking about the obligatory migration quotas that european commission was calling for . 
  yes , i like eu but i 'm discouraged sometimes by people like you that have so distorted view of some countries , have n't been to them but are keen to generalise . 
  crimea is ukrainian and not russian . 
  let 's not get over it . 
  so what do you want to say here basically is : `` yeah , we are so important we even get terrorist attacks '' ? 
  you eastern europe are not important so you wo n't get any terrorist attack '' ? 
  that 's some sick thinking . 
  like terrorism was something good . 
  we are n't scared of a handful brown people . 
  we oppose the current eu immigration policy saying that we should let everyone in , not even knowing who he is but that does n't mean we want to leave eu . 
  in fact , majority of poles support the eu . 
  also , your ` joke ' about putin was not funny . 
  in my opinion judging a nation based on unrealistic image of it that you have created in your head is really fucking sad . 
  please hype another start do-train with fraction of every population . 
  my eu4 experience tells me that venice , but i may be wrong . 
  warsaw was also the place where king resided . 
  and his court ofc . 
  i 've had no idea that baltic states ' gnp were so high , even higher than spain ... really . 
  ok coup d'etat of 1926 , but how can you blame him for 1920-26 when he was not governing ? 
  i still think the coup was necessary as the polish politics of this time was really shitty , could n't do anything and we needed a strong leadership . 
  by the way pi\u0142sudski did not rule after the coup anyway . 
  and yes , i would count 1920 as a positive year because if we had lost in warsaw , there would not be the second polish republic . 
  also [ lithuanians had an agreement with soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war#territorial_changes ) in which they would take these polish terrains that soviets ` guaranteed ' them . 
  how was lithuania richer than poland ? 
  and how can you blame pi\u0142sudski for things after 1919 if he was n't the one governing ? 
  and you forgot about his epic win in warsaw in 1920 . 
  how is tel-aviv an european city ? 
  what 's up with that gotland wanting to be russian ? 
  come on , that 's not his fault , no one can make country go from super poor to super rich in a few years . 
  think that way if it makes you feel better . 
  sorry , you were the ones to develop the most retarded system ever and install it in half of europe , using force . 
  we did win against communism in 1920 though . 
  let 's speak about the facts and not about what could have been . 
  ruling government propaganda . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i actually learned a lot of spanish on duo . 
  ca n't tell for russian tho, 
  worked for central and eastern europe , of course . 
  for millions of people under the soviet regime . 
  also take note that it 's the ussr that attacked afghanistan first . 
  to help communists that would n't win without russian help . 
  do you actually suggest that people move to poland because of our government ? 
  or maybe it 's blue because same sex sexual activity was never criminalised there . 
  look at the notes : in lithuania legal until 1795 ( 3rd partition of poland ) . 
  yeah , `` very very large majority '' . 
  bad intolerant poland . 
  i open the map and think : `` oh , who 's that terrible big red dot ? '' . 
  right , poland . 
  oh wow i did n't know we have such a diversity, 
  i do n't know if i ever heard of gwiazdor , if so it 's really rare . 
  slavic tribes started settling in the terrains of modern western poland . 
  several dozens of tribes existed , but most of them are presumed based on archeological research . 
  not many documents from this period exist to give precise information . 
  nato does n't occupy foreign territory , unlike russia . 
  lmao it 's even in the name of the country . 
  `` polish commonwealth '' . 
  what do we consider latvia before ww1 ? 
  weastern europe, 
  many former warsaw pact countries are in nato now . 
  wait ... do you blame russia for conquering siberia ? 
  i 've also heard from my spanish friend that when you do n't speak catalonian , some people would rather speak english to you than castillian . 
  but castillian and catalonian are two different - though similiar - languages . 
  no no , we were talking about holocaust not some immigration . 
  you called holocaust a mainstream ` fact ' and while you admitted that hitler called for extermination of jews , you did n't answer my question . 
  [ denying holocaust is a crime punished in many european countries .
