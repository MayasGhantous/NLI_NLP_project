  btw netherlands look like confederate flag . 
  this, 
  when you have a large stack , you can effectively reduce revolt risk . 
  just be careful not to go over your supply limit . 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ eu4 ^ ^ reference, 
  that looks so stupid . 
  why an hour , literally in a minute / s or a second, 
  pls use our claim on kaliningrad and vassal feed us, 
  only against germany , 
  not caring for the elections at all does n't justify anyone . 
  if we do n't care about the election , we do n't care about eu and even our country ... 
  what 's the point of keeping him in the prison if he 's changed ? 
  the lives wo n't return anyway . 
  that 's gon na destroy the eu . 
  forcing things like that . 
  except that we actually place them in words . 
  i think you guys were in the middle of eating the falling kievian rus . 
  but spain is a receiver , no ? 
  that 's a tech curiosity rather than a general trend . 
  we do n't even know if this factory is actually working . 
  where are you taking your data from ? 
  i always thought it is the poorer countries with cheaper labour where the production moves . 
  you can install the machines and teach people how to use them and you can pay them 2-3x less than in germany or france . 
   except the opposite is happening [ certainly not in here ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-07/whirlpool-is-sending-french-jobs-to-poland-and-candidates-shrug ), 
  actually i 'd be ok with that but i 'd from laughter with the czech language . . no offense it 's awesome but still very funny, 
   kingdom of poland since it establishment in 950 kingdom of poland was n't established in 950 . 
  [ mexico is nowhere near peace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_drug_war ) and there are [ very violent protests in venezuela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%e2%80%9317_venezuelan_protests ) due to tough economic situation and other things . 
  straight from my mind right now , there are surely reasons for other countries as well . 
  for you it does n't sound stupid , for me it does . 
  what 's the point of your comment ? 
  crimea just got significantly smaller . 
  czech is an adjective and czechia really sounds stupid . 
  yes , nato would protest about russia sending troops to canada . 
  the thing is , natos ' sending of troops to its eastern allies is a reaction to russia annexing crimea . 
  it 's them who attacked georgia in 2008 and it 's them who illegally keep their forces in moldavia . 
  we have legitimate reasons to expect russian invasion and the nato forces are here to assure we do n't get attacked . 
   so to sum it up , nato ca n't threaten russia with war for sending war material and missiles in cuba , and then have the usa send thousands of troops , tanks and f-35 's in estonia . 
  it 's hypocricy . 
  lmao you make it sound like it 's an entire us army right at russia 's border . 
  in fact it is few hundred people rotating frequently and literally a few fighter jets patrolling baltic skies . 
  meanwhile , russia is carrying out military exercises which are way bigger than nato 's , like in 2015 when they mobilized almost 100k soldiers . 
  it 's not hypocricy , it 's common sense . 
   so basically you one-sidedly decide that the forces that you already have outside of the `` enemy 's '' borders are fair game but the nukes that he would have ( in the cuban crisis example ) are somehow unfair and wrong ? 
  how convenient . . could n't understand it . 
  if you are assuming that i support usa putting ballistic missiles in turkey then you are wrong . 
   how do you draw the line like that ? 
  russia could also distinguish between armed soldiers and armors and decide that nato having tanks and missile launchers outside of its borders is also different and wrong . 
  would you obey and remove every tank there simply because russia `` clearly distinguishes between the two '' ? 
  the whole warfare is now divided between conventional warfare and nuclear warfare . 
  it 's not me who invented it , it 's a well-known division . 
  no wonder 190 countries have signed the [ treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons )  besides the usa wanted to also install missiles in poland and romania if i 'm not mistaken . 
  defensive missiles only . 
   the point is that if you use the argument that `` this sovereign state has invited foreign forces and material in it so it 's not a russian matter '' , then the russians can do the same and you should agree that the usa were wrong in the cuban missile crisis . 
  i never said they were n't wrong . 
   i 'm not twisting your words . 
  i 'm using the exact same argument you brought . 
  you just realised that it backfired and you 're trying to get out of it instead of admitting that you 're being hypocritical . 
  then you did n't understand my comment well enough , you assume things you should n't . 
  i never wrote anything about usa but you assumed that i support them and only they are right lmao, 
  i was talking about inviting forces , not about a deployment of freaking nuclear missiles . 
  you are twisting my words . 
  i clearly showed in my comment that i distinguish these two things . 
   let 's try and look at it from another perspective . 
  what if russia , iran , and north korea would sign a nato style treaty . 
  and russia would move their nuclear weapons to those states . 
  do you think that there would be no opposition from us and other countries ? 
  no nukes in poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania . 
  any sovereign state can have inside any forces they invite , and it is not a russian matter . 
  russia places military bases on its soil , near the borders , but when nato places military bases on its soil , near the borders , then it is encircling and threatening russia and sparking conflict . 
  is n't that a hypocrisy ? 
  well , i 'm not a historian but this is what i managed to dig : [ germany army strength vs allied army strength in september 1939 ] ( https://www.britannica.com/event/world-war-ii/forces-and-resources-of-the-european-combatants-1939 ) . 
   the allies actually had more planes in 1939 than germany did , but their strength was made up of many different types , some of them obsolescent . 
   at sea the odds against germany were much greater in september 1939 than in august 1914 , since the allies in 1939 had many more large surface warships than germany had . 
  [ stack exchange discussion ? 
  i know this is not a hard source but still , something you may look into ] ( https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/3042/why-didnt-france-and-uk-invade-germany-september-3rd-1939 ) . 
  [ and this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war#inactivity ) they could have ended the war in '39 together with the british , because germany needed time to recover after invading poland . 
  believe it or not , we destroyed and damaged many tanks and shot down many planes . 
  all it would take would be to destroy the industry in western germany , in ruhr area particularly . 
  not everybody is as courageous and ready to die as you . 
  france had the military power to end the war in 1939 . 
  germany had most of their military in poland and the western border was undermanned and weak . 
  the best joke is that the french had a powerful army , modern , with many tanks and airplanes but they were disorganised and hesitating . 
  [ they did launch an offensive in september 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_offensive ) however they withdrew quickly . 
  there was no war with czechoslovakia . 
  and what is declaration of war worth when it 's not followed by any action ? 
  that 's exactly what they did . 
  they waited a year doing nothing . 
  see that link u/glarxan provided . 
  lmao admit already you do n't know a thing about plc , you just wanted to sound smart, 
  french people did n't care about poland in 1939 . 
  and 1 year later they got attacked themselves . 
  if you do n't come to war , the war will come to you . 
  what 's so strange about poland having 62 % ? 
  if there 's no one to defend estonia , why not ? 
  are you sure that russia attacking estonia would trigger a global conflict ? 
  because looking at this poll i 'm doubtful . 
  in the shed , you mean . 
  is it really being shady and exploiting when a company wants to decrease its expenses ?
