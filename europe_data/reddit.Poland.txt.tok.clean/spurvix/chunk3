  party is n't ruled by him but by more reasonable people , when ( if ) they 'll take part in ruling they will fulfill party 's programme and not his bullshit offensive statements . 
  he 's in the party to get media attention , kicking him out would be suicide . 
  luckily more and more unknows from congress are invited to media . 
  they 're much better . 
  requesting a brit to comment on this . 
  * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ finally ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ understands * thank you, 
  that 's the problem . 
  ultimately , voters will choose in referendum . 
  everybody has right to sell and not sell things to whoever they want to . 
  next , please ? 
  so he ca n't be right with using wrong words ? 
  does usage of vulgar words make whole statement irrevelant ? 
   naive 18 years old people who vote for him just to buy some legal weed . 
  no , that was palikot 's movement . 
  right is about muh freedoms which attracts middle-class young people and small entrepreneurs . 
  this does n't answer my question . 
  yes , if britain would want it . 
  government always knows better than the people !, 
  why should i care ? 
  why do you thing more equality is better ? 
  being employed means signing a contract , where employee agrees with employer on some things . 
  if employer accepts a possibility of a strike , there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  but forcing everyone who employs someone to give them that right is imo wrong . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with that if employee can leave without any consequences . 
  nobody forces you to do things `` their way '' . 
   it takes two to tango , but your phrasing `` strikes leave greece in the dark '' makes it seem that it 's all the fault of the people who decided to strike . 
  well it 's their fault . 
  they should be fired and new people , ones that want to work should be hired . 
  general stance is that we 've avoided crisis thanks to having z\u0142oty , opinions are mixed : in lastest poll , 46 % is for euro , 42 % against . 
  49 % think that adopting euro would be a bad move , 16 % have contrary opinion . 
  yeah , 2222 sounds like perfect year to adopt euro . 
  we 'll do it someday , we promise !, 
  why does organizer have to give a reason ? 
  it 's private torunament . 
  i do n't see how it 's discrimination - if you do n't like it , open your own torunament allowing both males and females . 
  you can . 
  it would be discrimination if it was n't possible . 
  everybody has right to host a male only/female only/max 1.8 m tall only/ginger only/disabled people only/children only tournament . 
  people of course can ( and will , because they should ) complain about but , but government should n't have right to force anybody to change rules in private tournament run by private person . 
  yes . 
  they should be elected democratically . 
  bad idea . 
  someone may do n't want to support charity , but want to buy the book . 
  banning any book will only make it more popular . 
  i did n't say that . 
  yes , i had same remarks to the author . 
  still , percents remain the same . 
   the downvotes are suggesting most of people here do n't agree with you !, 
  so what , should i stop posting ? 
  if you want everybody who 's against eu stop posting here you could rename this sub as / r/eucirclejerk . 
  providing opinions contrary to sub mainstream can do only good i think , diversity is good . 
   the goal of forming an european union was not to drink champagne and eat caviar with the 5 richest european countries but to form a big and strong union . 
  yes , that goal was good . 
  but after all those years eu became more than it was meant to . 
  i do n't want parliament . 
  i do n't want eu president or anything . 
  i just want free markets and free movement of people . 
   again for me it 's the duty of the wealthy eu countries to help their less fortunate brothers and once we will probably all live as a big united and happy family . 
  nobody has obligation to help anybody , if countries want to do that it 's fine , but forcing frenchmen/english/etc . 
  to pay for polish/romanian/etc . 
  roads , while taking much more than needed ( for eurocrats to administer it ) is pathetic . 
  nevermind than !, 
  ukraine : * 155th in economic freedom index * corruption ( `` corruption , one of ukraine 's most serious problems , continues to worsen . 
  business magnates benefit financially from their close association with top politicians . '' ), 
  * not allowing small/medium businesses to grow * ex-kgb everywhere this could apply to most of cis members i think . 
  look at baltic states , they did it right as ex-ussr members ( i 'm having kicking out communism and corruption in mind ) . 
  rich should cooperate with rich , those in middle of the road with ones like them . 
  it will benefit everyone . 
  that eu does n't make anything less corupt ; eu means more public jobs which allows even more corruption . 
  again , free movement of people is n't eu thing . 
  everything could be done by agreements . 
   yeah but you ca n't `` own '' a country with just a trade partnership . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it all depends what you 'll write in the agreement . 
  time to start learning romanian . 
  is this related with polish `` messiah of europe '' romantic conception ? 
  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ), 
  [ graphic ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/33196/podatki_panstwo.jpeg ) the chart you see is comparison of income taxes in uk vs polish ones . 
  could n't find english one , sorry . 
  dunno about you , here in poland nothing changed , it even got worse than i thought ( tape scandal ), 
  yup , we should n't join either until we got shit in our country done . 
  you can have trade partnership without eu . 
  hard to pick only one . 
  high taxes i guess . 
  after opening job markets to romania and bulgaria it 's too late anyway, 
  thank you !, 
  sikorski is n't poland . 
  am i poland ? 
  liberals in american meaning ; socialist in european one . 
  yeah it 's ridiculous . 
  i doubt that letting bulgaria , romania and croatia in was a good move . 
  you socialist !, 
  i agree * ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ believe ^ ^ you ^ ^ got ^ ^ downvoted ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ got ^ ^ upvoted *, 
  umm , safety ? 
  hurr durr racism who cares in poland ? 
   no one would allow poland to research poland researching is bad , pakistan & india researching is good !, 
  thinking that way we should n't ally with anyone , because `` what can happen in the future ? 
  '' , is n't it like that ? 
  germany ? 
  germany should be our biggest ally now ( fuck the us ) , but most people are like `` hurr durr ww2 germony is bad '',
