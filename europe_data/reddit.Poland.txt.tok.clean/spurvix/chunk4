  wow , so they are all aware about that . 
  sikorski is best minister in this gov imo , too bad he says one thing and does the other ; nothing discrediting in this recording . 
  why ? 
  they are normal people , but if someone ca n't manage to finish school he ca n't be taken as serious , responsible person . 
  who cares about ones sex orientation ? 
  who cares about ethnicity ? 
  if people want to go to war , nobody should have right to forbid them to . 
  i 'm not talking about degree , i 'm talking about finishing high school . 
  no , i want wettins on polish throne too !, 
  revenge ? 
  it 's one of best things that happened to poland . 
  yes , people who did n't finish school should not have right to vote . 
  they 're simply too stupid . 
  remember that when you 'll need to pay spain 's debts . 
  poor lithuania . 
  yes , growing some plants is really dangerous for everybody !, 
  germany pls no bully :(, 
  he does n't want women to vote . 
  he does n't want anybody who is n't interested in politics to have right to vote . 
  is n't it obvious that most women and men are n't interested in politics ? 
  it 's mental shortcut saying that we should have more voting censuses , such as education or income . 
   that women should not have to right to vote it 's not party 's statement ; knp ( jkm 's party ) wants republicanism ( democracy with more voting censuses )  all public services ( education , healthcare , transport , pensions and so on ) should be privatized or shut down because they should be  who considers putin reasonable politician etc he is n't ? 
  he 's good at realizing russia 's imperialistic policy . 
   and let 's face it - if that 's the worst what months worth of illegal recording campaign produced about our politicians then i 'm quite happy about the state our politics are in . 
   i 'm happy with having corrupted government which is n't respecting laws and constitution . 
  why there are people like this . 
   that 's why they have n't released everything . 
  still there is no damn way that there is something really damning there and they started with those 2 conversations . 
  yup , discussing about how much they can have will lead to nowhere . 
  they can have something on everybody or it 's as much as they 've got . 
   they hyped on saturday to sell this monday . 
  and so they hype even more to sell even more on the next monday !, 
  also , like i said , releasing everything at once would be a bad decision . 
   people are getting excited here over nothing . 
  constitutionally independent head of national bank is making a deal with government member to finance the deficit ( it 's illegal ) in exchange for nbp-friendly minister of finance ? 
  nah , it 's nothing . 
  we do n't talk about * him * much . 
  they said they made backups, 
  it 's not the end of democracy , it 's beggining . 
  kicking out corrupt government is democratic . 
  shame that we needed 7 years of their rule for this . 
  in poland it 's vat for example , so no . 
  they maybe want to build up hype , to sell more . 
  it 's pretty logical . 
  i can understand making logical mistakes , but being proud about that shows stupidity of someone . 
  poland is romania , and romania is poland now . 
  it 's a logical fallacy . 
  take a look at this : https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/assets/fallaciesposterhigherres.jpg, 
  everything that 's happening right now in poland is his fault , because he is head of gov. 
  kaczy\u0144ski , on the other hand , is responsible for nothing . 
  much better . 
  pis will surely agree for common sense economic reforms which will be popular among voters ( simpler tax system and bureaucracy ) and will stop knp 's nonsense ones ( e.g. 
  their propsed reform of judicial system ) . 
  win-win for both parties . 
  nope , i think that this scenario is most likely : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28hhxy/polish_authorities_search_premises_of_weekly_that/cib1c4u ( points 2 and 3 happened last week ), 
  i 've said exactly that . 
  and you said something completely different . 
  considering state of polish economy in 1990 and its potential , only communism could ever stop the growth . 
  but we could 've much higher growth with simpler and lower taxes and no political oportunism ; properly performed privatization and lustration . 
  i 've never said  po-voters are rich wykrzta\u0142ciuchy which oppress catholic working class ... oh and they are probably jews can you even read ? 
   anyone who still has any bit of faith left in po is either blind or is family of bureaucrats , which that guy is for sure . 
  ya know , i 'm not pis fanatic either . 
  but choosing one evil instead of another is equal to doing nothing . 
  it 's all kaczynski 's fault !, 
   without sarcasm : they are same thing expect that po members have statistically 50 iq points more than pis followers source ? 
  or you are another of `` hurr vote for po or you 'll have kaczynski as pm !!!!!! '', 
  people ? 
  asap = monday , they said it . 
  ** it 's good that they do n't release everything in one go , because that way it will get more media coverage . 
  pis ruled during economic boom , so they had easier time ; they even lowered the taxes . 
  i hate pis , but their leader , contrary to po leader , seems like he cares about poland , and not his interests . 
  i 'm on completely opposite side of political spectrum , but i 'd choose pis over po if that was the only option . 
  * ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ probably ^ ^ an ^ ^ exaggeration , ^ ^ but ^ ^ if ^ ^ lech ^ ^ kaczy\u0144ski ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ fly ^ ^ to ^ ^ georgia ^ ^ it ^ ^ could ^ ^ end ^ ^ as ^ ^ ukraine . 
  pis is essentially same thing as po . 
  do n't worry , there are a fucking lot of people voting on * him * just because * he 's * one of few people not connected with current clique . 
  i do n't want a lot of things that * he * proposes . 
  but i want gasp of fresh air in politics . 
  yes , new government promised to leave them with high pensions and no trials for treason etc ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_round_table_agreement, 
   well , whoever did this , it 's not as important as what more might be on tapes . 
  hello common sense , 
  poland and romania are very similiar i think . 
  difference is that in romania , during fall of su , commies killed commies - in poland commies talked with commies, 
  they must have something on tusk . 
  man who recorded this is national hero . 
  still waiting for that srs ban . 
  my parents beat me when i did something very bad . 
  considering how stubborn i was in my childhood , this was the only solution . 
  and it worked . 
  voting for that flip-flop ? 
  i agree , comedy gold indeed . 
  that 's why i voted for russia , just for potential fun next year :d, 
  why are you proud of some idiots judging musical act based on political situation in europe ? 
  shame russia did n't win , imagine all the butthurt :p, 
  democracy in a nutshell . 
  people are voting for who 's famous . 
  i never really believed that he could lose , but now ... everything 's possible !, 
  and even if duda 's not from my dream , at least i 'm sure he can proudly represent us at international stage, 
  [ yes !,
