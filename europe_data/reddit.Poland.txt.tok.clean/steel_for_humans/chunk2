  legitimate question . 
  my question is legitimate . 
  i 'm surprised there can be a country where almost nobody is homeless . 
  i 'd also want to know why . 
  i thought there are homeless people everywhere in the world ( tribal people excluded ) . 
  thank you , that 's very informative . 
  there are no homeless in norway ? 
  that map looks like a field trip guide . 
  there 's the path , interesting spots are marked . 
  it only lacks a `` you are here '' mark ... 
  it 's a bit uncomfortable i even thought of that ... 
  does it work ? 
  yeah , it 's probably cold outside , anyway . 
  and he has a ps2 , does n't need to go to work , has food served to him . 
  i also heard they ride horses ( is that true ) ? 
  do you know how expensive riding a horse is in poland ? 
  if you are a homeless person in norway all you have to do is kill some people and get yourself arrested . 
  hilton 5 * prison , here i come !, 
  what 's the third from the top ? 
  interesting ~ ~ font ~ ~ ( i do n't have a term to call it . . 
  help ? 
  ) , i think i have never seen it . 
  oh god ... 
  i never heard of it , so til . 
  i 'm speechless . 
  thanks for sharing the info . 
  this is horrible . 
  belgian chocolate is what i buy people for christmas every year ( plus others presents , of course , but there has to be belgian chocolate ) . 
  well , he dressed in the best clothing he had . 
  the white one is for special occasions . 
  nice , so many downvotes for basically saying you 're being rude , calling people names and presenting your own country in a very bad light on international subreddits , such as / r/europe . 
  this proves my point . 
  disclaimer : i am not a pis voter , i do not condone what they are doing . 
  i just see much hatred towards your fellow citizens and your own country . 
  vote differently , be vocal , do n't be aggressive . 
  he 's trigger happy . 
  ca n't afford . 
  having adidas , reebok or nike was a thing in 80/90s poland . 
  you ruled the neighborhood if you had genuine apparel . 
  they inject potato juice . 
  unless they actually wrote it together , but the other guy did n't read the whole thing . 
  you know - i think it was about entrance to the establishment , not buying . 
  the details are blurry now . 
  at the next pub i did n't buy my beer , they bought it and gave me . 
  i had a different experience . 
  my hosts even argued with the staff , told them i 'm from poland and that i left my id at their home because i did n't know of the rule ( i definitely looked way over 21 ) . 
  they said they ca n't , it 's the law , sorry . 
  we went to another pub and i got my beer there . 
  the thing is i hear people telling the same story . 
  good to hear it 's not like that everywhere . 
  i 'm sure i wo n't forget my id the next time . 
   judging from reddit , i 've always thought that americans are on the other end of the spectrum , but it seems like that place is reserved for norway and poland . 
  :d maybe it is . 
  driving after drinking in poland is a big no and will get you in trouble . 
  interesting - i was in croatia and the waiter offered me a beer . 
  he said it 's ok to drink a small beer and drive , but i am polish and would not dare ( unless you show me the exact law in writing which allows that in your country and i 'm 100 % sure i wo n't go to jail ) . 
  i did not trust him , thinking he was just trying to sell me the beer . 
  from what you 're saying he was just being croat . 
  i experienced it first hand in the us . 
  we went to a pub , everybody ordered beer . 
  except they came by car and then went home by car . 
  i , coming from europe , was like - wtf ? 
  they told me it 's normal to have a small beer ( or two ) and drive . 
  i also read in a book ( might not be true ) that as long as you drive straight , do n't break any rules and your car is ok - then the police have no right to pull you over and check your alcohol level . 
  it 's just not allowed in usa , they have no reason to stop you . 
  afaik - it works the same way in poland * on paper * , but most people are not aware , police has always pulled people over for routine checks and i guess you do n't want to argue with them , anyway . 
  also , in the us , they wo n't sell you alcohol if you do n't have an id on you . 
  you are a 78 year old , white hair , wrinkled guy with a cane , but you do n't have an id stating you 're 21 ? 
  no beer for you !, 
  but you can drive drunk if you have an id . 
   american logic . 
  technically , russia is the largest country on earth . 
  ^ im ^ fun ^ at ^ parties , ^ i ^ promise . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean , ^ ^ i ^ ^ would ^ ^ be , ^ ^ if ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ ever ^ ^ invited . 
   i fail to see the humor in the picture . 
  but then , i am german . 
  i think it 's the choice of language and style in which things are said . 
  i have the same impression , i.e. , / r/polska shits on polska , basically . 
  much hatred , it goes further than critique . 
  not everyone and it 's sad . 
  nice to see somebody else noticed the trend . 
  i briefly remember reading about it some day - * philosophy * ( as in phd ) has a different meaning in the us than in europe . 
  when we say * philosophy * we mean a person who is an unemployable ( in his area of expertise ) thinker with a major in philosophy from a polish university doing dishes in the uk . 
   the kind who ponders why the world is the way it is and and it lowers our gdp . 
  in the us , the `` doctor of philosophy '' could be a neurobiology researcher or something like that . 
  i am sure this is not accurate , just something i read . 
  i used to put a lot of sugar ( like three teaspoons ) in my tea , but stopped doing that eventually . 
  now i do n't like sweetened tea . 
  part of that may be because when i used to sweeten my tea i was drinking cheap teabag stuff and then i moved to leaf tea . 
  the former was very strong and dark and was barely drinkable without sugar . 
  leaf tea is not as strong and actually has distinctive taste ( i can tell different tea varieties by taste , like ceylon , darjeeling and dianhong ( yunnan ) taste differently ) . 
  that is why americans did n't want british tea and dumped it in the sea . 
  only in winter . 
  it helps with cold ( except it really does n't , because lemon magic does n't work after it 's poured over with hot water/tea ) . 
  it sounds like they target the german tourists , [ who love apfelstrudel tea ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/6i727g/remember_the_apfelstrudel_tea/ ) . 
  yes , sounds like inka . 
  i would n't market divka in poland , though because it almost sounds like an invective in polish . 
   i 'd drink absolutely anything one serves me as coffee have you tried our [ inka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inka_\\ ( beverage \\ ) ) ? 
  it was very popular in communist poland when it was very difficult to get your hands on real coffee . 
  http://www.grana.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/inka.jpg i remember the smell and taste from my childhood and was pleasantly surprised they restarted the brand a few years ago .
