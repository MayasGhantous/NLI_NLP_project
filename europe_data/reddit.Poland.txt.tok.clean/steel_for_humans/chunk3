   maybe it never stopped , but i have not seen it for years until recently . 
  i think it 's piss poor as a coffee substitute ( taste , lack of caffeine ) , but it 's quite good with hot milk ( made like cocoa , without water ) . 
  bag tea is out of question , sadly . 
  i do n't touch that stuff ( unless i 'm pressed to the wall ) . 
  we actually learned to take our leaf tea with us when going abroad . 
   it sucks when you 're in a hotel , though , and they do n't give you a kettle . 
  you go to the hotel restaurant and there 's no tea in the menu . 
  you want to go in the sea and drown ... 
  that was my impression while being in croatia . 
  i am a heavy tea drinker and ( my impression ) nobody drinks tea in croatia . 
  it 's a tough time for me being there , i suffer greatly . 
  one of the first things i do after returning home is to make myself a cup of tea and enjoy it . 
  i find this map surprising , croatia should be darkly colored . 
  yeah , i 'm confused by this because i understand `` productivity '' differently than in economics . 
  to me it always meant to work hard and get stuff done . 
  i think that 's how regular people perceive it . 
  i finished 7 tasks today , you finished 5 - i am more productive . 
  except it looks like i 'm not , because my 7 tasks were worth 1000 eur and yours 5 were worth 3000 eur . 
  i think that 's what it means . . ? 
  so it does n't mean we ( poles ) are lazy bums . 
  [ it looks like germans actually work the least in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time#oecd_ranking ) . 
  if i understand correctly , it means we are not effective and work on cheap stuff like agriculture or sales or lack in high-tech industries . 
   do you really want to take turkey and poland as an example here ? 
  : / i do n't feel like living in a dictatorship ( yet ? ) . 
  such comments are uncomfortable , the way foreigners see us now . 
  the stuff i find on reddit , it never stops to amaze me . 
  ( before somebody comments - i am aware it 's not official , but the sole idea of it is amazing ), 
   i think it is mostly how technologicaly advanced the economy is . 
  this is what i 'm thinking . 
  see , poland sucks on that map , 60 % of eu average . 
  yet , in other sources , i often read how hard working poles are compared to other european nations . 
  and we still do 60 % of european gdp average . 
  does that mean we work hard in non-valuable industries ? 
  can somebody eli5 for me ? 
  how does it work considering how rich or poor each economy is ? 
  so sorry to hear that . 
  :( i love that region ( split , sibenik , trogir ) . 
  i hope the fires get under control soon . 
  i do n't want to see them burn . 
  has this happened before on such scale ? 
  i know . 
  i meant most americans have n't seen or used a sidewalk . 
  it was a joke , sheesh . 
  i drove a car out of split a couple years ago during such storm . 
  it was totally dark , somebody was pouring a waterfall on my car , we maintained a steady 20km/h max speed and were climbing some mountain . 
  to one side i had a rocky wall and to the other i had a fastlane to death ( aka precipice with no barrier ) . 
  there was lightning and thunder all the time . 
  and i was the first in a line of cars , of course , the other people following me . 
  it was one of the worst storms i have experienced and one of the worst times to drive a car . 
  but it makes a good story now . 
  because there 's not enough of bikelanes . 
  pedestrians like to walk on bikelanes , though , with which they greatly annoy bicyclers . 
  this is what happens when you pedal on the sidewalk . 
  edit : forgot to link to the sidewalk definition for our american friends . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sidewalk ) . 
  in poland people often ride their bicycles on sidewalks which greatly annoys pedestrians ( and when they ride on the road it greatly annoys car drivers ) . 
  hence ~ ~ they ~ ~ their bicycles should be hanged . 
  greenland is inhabited o_o, 
   getting over the wall is very easy for the tech savvy and those with a hint of intelligence , so it really only stops old people and the stupid . 
  i think every country needs its firewall then . 
   of course it did n't help that just one year before the ** british ** broke the versailles treaties by ** selling ships to the german navy ** by more than they were allowed to have . 
  til, 
   why die for danzig ? 
  it 's a fine city !, 
  you should visit . 
  what about razem ? 
  they seem extreme left and are young . 
  `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . '', 
  not saying we should hate each other , but it 's important to remember and understand . 
  anything in particular i should read about ? 
  i feel ignorant right now . 
  * i have genital herpes , the world must know !, 
  * some things you do n't show to strangers , come on . 
   but in finland , 70 % of `` witches '' who were prosecuted were men the witcher , 
  i feel i need to downvote this so people do n't see it ... 
  even if it 's satirical ( is it ? ), 
  it 's terrible on so many levels . 
  this reminds me ... http://georgeboole.com/boole/life/ucc/death/  george died of pneumonia on 8 december 1864 at his home in ballintemple . 
    & nbsp ;   on 24 november he had walked about three miles from his home to the university in pouring rain . 
  he conducted the lecture he was so anxious not to miss in wet clothes and immediately developed a feverish cold . 
  his weak constitution offered little resistance and his lungs rapidly became infected . 
  ** but as a believer in the relatively new discipline of homeopathy , mary boole held very unorthodox medical beliefs . 
  by putting her husband to bed and drenching him in water she may have unwittingly hastened his early death . 
   is the ** suicide/coffee ** capital of the us there 's a correlation for you . 
   eastern countries like poland central , goddamit !, 
  if you keep walking west you may fall into the atlantic . 
  it 's dark . 
  yup , the scariest part of it, 
   helpress herpress , you got it right on the other words  they do n't have an `` l '' sounding sound in their language , hence their funny speech . 
   russia , which views the deployment of nato forces near its borders as a provocation , has strongly denied any plans to invade poland or the baltic countries . 
  xd i snickered . 
  not saying they plan to , the world looks a bit different now , but that sentence - the very existence of it in the article - makes me laugh . 
  it 's the same as our pis party . 
  `` everybody '' hates them - they get elected twice and have a majority now . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ( can you see that emoticon 's right arm ? 
  it does n't work for me : / ), 
  i was expecting to see 80 , it 's actually surprisingly low for poland . 
   but if they fuck a little boy it was ok , because in that way he was made a real man uh , if i was a greek boy at that time i 'd never want to grow up !, 
  thanks . 
   it looks kinda similar to the contemporary british flag , but not quite .
