  so what is this flag ? 
  is this moderators trolling americans on this fine day or is it an actual historic flag ? 
  the comic is funny , anyway , 
  thanks, 
  this subreddit is depressing today . 
  first thing in the morning i 'm looking at the map of europe in 1900 and now i am reminded how poor we are . 
  i did n't know ~ ~ the czech republic ~ ~ czechia is so far ahead . 
  sometimes i think that if we were treated as equals , i could live under a foreign empire - especially if i was born there . 
  if it did not suck . 
  maybe i 'd feel austro-hungarian . . ? 
  just like some people call themselves europeans . 
  not a popular opinion , i guess . 
  but whenever i 'm reading about that period i wonder about that . 
  unfortunately as far as i know the krakow area was poor and it sucked . 
  this is kinda uneasy . 
  i was literally reading `` masters of death : the ss-einsatzgruppen and the invention of the holocaust '' by richard rhodes yesterday before bed and it was about einsatzgruppen operating in lithuania in 1941 , where lithuanians ( truth be told - those were prisoners released by ss to stage a small show ) were brutally murdering jews in the streets . 
  and now i see this comic about joining the germans against the soviets , huh . 
  they started in 1920 's , though . 
  btw , i was in the doku-zentrum in nuremberg last week ( highly recommended ) . 
  i forget about the existence of liechtenstein . 
  : / i know about luxembourg because of big corporations and tax avoidance . 
  :d good point , sir . 
  i did n't know or have forgotten of the roman origin of the ( now nazi ) salute . 
  did i use offensive language and called the op names ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  just expressing my opinion . 
  counting birthdays of dead people ( here - dead commonwealth - which is all the stranger because we do n't wish a happy birthday to things ... ) makes me a bit uneasy . 
  i find it strange . 
  it did in years preceding wwii . 
  nsdap was slowly removing all opposition and gaining complete power , then enacting various laws ( such as anti-jew ) . 
  initially they were just a party like the others . 
  are you saying the photos and videos in the media are fake ? 
  this is like reading about pope john paul ii 's next birtday ( every year ) when he has been dead for 12 years . 
  what 's the point ? 
  it 's all intertwined , is n't it ? 
   i know hre only from crusader kings ii . 
  austria ran it ? 
  i thought it was the germans . 
  this . 
  pride parades , looking at some photos , often look to me like some freak show . 
  while two casually dressed ( same as hetero ) guys kissing and hugging is ok . 
  they are just two guys who are together - i do n't have a problem with that . 
  but if you go naked in the city with feathers in your ass and bdsm leather straps - it is not normal anymore . 
  such image is offputting to me , it does more harm than good to the lgbt movement . 
  this is my favorite subreddit . 
  while / r/poland and / r/polska ( especially the latter ) are filled with hatred , this one has people from all over europe - talking culturally ( maybe i have not seen otherwise ? 
  i do n't read every post ) , exchanging funny remarks and giving each other a nudge , but in a friendly manner . 
  it shows me we can live together in the eu and i would like to see this kind of behavior outside of reddit and irl . 
  precisely what i was thinking about . 
   the broken chains are also worth mentioning . 
  i think that 's what was left after polish , czech and others escaped in 1918 . :p, 
  estonia - back to school the netherlands - casino & roulette  tiny countries like liechtenstein have it more like a conference room . 
  i like the ones in old settings , with sculptures , columns and paintings . 
  edit : i think my favorite is austrian federal council . 
  it 's rad , however it also makes me think somebody had a huge ego and thought they were the roman empire . 
  edit2 : thanks for all the comments about hre . 
  yet - hre is not the same as roman empire ( the ancient one ) and the looks of that assembly hall resemble classical era art , while hre started in middle ages . 
  but i do n't know how hre 's lineage is derived from the roman empire , especially seeing as germanic people at that time were seen as savage barbarians . 
  beatiful view . 
  now i want to go there . 
   nevermind , you 're talking about ios . 
  not sure how things work there . 
  you ca n't have another browser engine on ios . 
  everything is safari , including google chrome , which is just a skin , but has to use safari 's rendering engine . 
  i 've used ddg for a few years now . 
  the results i get are good , i very rarely have to use ! g bang . 
  recently i started using qwant because they are located in europe . 
  still testing it . 
  good point, 
  please note that the polish variant uses cheaper raw products ( less than half butter and cheap palm oil ) , yet costs the same . 
  it 's my polish sentiment related to wwii where great britain and france `` rushed to our defense in 1939 '' / s by declaring war on germany and then just sitting * . 
  i ca n't help it but feel that if somebody invaded us the history would repeat itself . 
  yet , poland seeks safety within nato . 
  i just hope it works . 
  i hope we never have to find out . 
  \\* well , that 's how it 's seen here , words but no action, 
  so how does it work ? 
  the lowest wage in germany is 3x the lowest wage in poland , but the biscuits ' price is the same ( 0.7 eur / 2 + pln ) . 
   my experience is limited , but polish-made food is seriously some of the best i 've ever tasted in my life thanks . 
   however , we are talking about highly processed food coming from external markets . 
  for example , take leibnitz butter biscuits which are sold under the same brand in poland and germany . 
  [ the polish one has ** palm oil ** and only ** 5 % of butter ** ] ( https://ezakupy.tesco.pl/groceries/pl-pl/products/2003005641948 ) , while [ the german one has ** 12 % of butter ** and no palm oil ] ( http://www.leibniz.de/produkte/butterkeks.html#/slide_1 ) . 
  i think the reason given was that poles ca n't afford real butter cakes , so we need a cheaper option . 
  however hardened oils are a health hazard . 
  the price for both products is ... roughly the same . 
  technically , it 's even cheaper in germany because of their purchasing power . 
  so the financial reason does not even make sense . 
  after reading the article from op , i guess those are not the same products , just like that coffee . 
  nato is not the same as eu . 
  i think nato gives us a ( false ? ), 
  feeling of security as a military pact , while eu is seen as meddling in internal affairs and telling us what to do . 
  by `` us '' i do n't mean myself , i 'm generalizing to depict how pro-nato and anti-eu people might feel . 
   it 's like when i found out that spaghetti ice cream apparently is n't a thing outside germany . 
  you can buy it in poland , however i never tried it . 
  also - i do n't use hotel wifi . 
  some hotels have premium wifi which allows you to download bigger files . 
  now i just think - bitch please , 6 $ per day ? 
  thanks , i have free lte !, 
  hey , before june 15 i would n't have done that . 
  i 'd have to pay a hefty sum for a 1gb roaming package and would be wary of any big downloads - i 'd think twice before tapping the download button .
