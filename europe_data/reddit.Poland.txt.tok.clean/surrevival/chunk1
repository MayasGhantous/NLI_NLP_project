as a silesian , i always have a laugh at this one :d [ meanwhile in silesia ] ( http://facefun.pl/static/foto/tymczasem-na-slasku-6236.jpg ), 
   belfast : majority do n't give a fuck what religion/political persuasion you are , the minority that do care will fuck life up for the rest of them . 
  this is sooo true :d, 
  [ anything man , anything . 
  ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/ukraine012214/s_u09_03450184.jpg ), 
  i would n't call it courage to be honest . 
  just look what he 's doing , he 's lost there , walking around between protesters and police , stones and all other stuff is flying above him and around , he 's talking in polish to berkut soldiers , he 's just lost . 
  few years ago there was a huuuuge riots in belfast , i was there photographing it as a press photographer and there was this guy with a camera , with no helmet ( just notice , people are approaching this jurnalist at least twice telling him wear the bloody helmet ! ), 
  running around , between the rioters and police , approaching in his braveness as he thought meters away of the rioters and taking photos of their faces ... till he got shoot in the leg . 
  this is not a courage ... its just a plain stupidity . 
  and you never travel , do you ? 
  yeah i know there is one but i have n't been there at the christmas market yet , 
  [ thats the christmas tree we have in belfast since yesterday ] ( http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/58/kaqm.jpg ), 
  man !, 
  sweet white cheese macaroni is delicious !, 
  my fiancee is also polish but she has never tried this and every time i was mentioning about it she was squeezing her face like crazy saying it must be discussing , till i made it for her . 
  the whole plate was empty in a blink of an eye !, 
  i remember this dish from kindergarten ( early 80 's ) , it was the best white cheese macaroni ( with a bit of cinnamon ! ), 
  i have ever eaten , so ... when i was 25 i met a lady who was a supervisor in this kindergarten , while we were talking , i 've mentioned about white cheese macaroni and she said she will give me a call next time when the kitchen will be making it . 
  and she did !, 
  so i went there and 20 years later , had the same dish made by the same cook !, 
   after all that time it was still soooo delicious , i really almost cried , here 's me , sitting in my old kindergarten , having my fav childhood dish , such a journey back in the past !, 
  u from east belfast by any chance mate ? 
  uk would be panicking already . 
  folks , that was just confirmed as misunderstanding and incorrect translation of his words by itar-tass corespondent irina polina http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,14669999.html&amp;usg=alkjrhjrc6sepka-k7rnalqrjeebogciug, 
  did you mean londonderry ? 
  i can certainly confirm that !, 
  i 'm polish , silesian and i 'm also having german citizenship does that mean i can not consider myself as a polish patriot ? 
  as a side note , i 'm not skeptical towards anyone ... maybe thats because i moved out from poland 7 years ago , met loads of fantastic people from all over the world and i think generalizing and stereotype way of thinking is just simply stupid ? 
  its a muslim school , is n't it ? 
  in catholic schools they 'd have to begin each day with a prayer ... whether or not they are catholic . 
  thats true . 
  i 'm originally from upper silesia ( now living in uk ) and obviously zywiec and tyskie are the most popular ones there . 
  i 'm very happy that i can get nice cold tyskie from winemark just around the corner or any tesco here in uk  we all forgot about also very good beer , lech !, 
  ... which is very popular in poznan i presume . 
  the order was completely random . 
  also , to make the test more `` independent '' i invited two of my friends for testing , italian and portuguese . 
  the verdict was two for perla as the best one , one for ksiazece zlote pszeniczne . 
  in general ... if someone wants to find out about polish music in 80 's , should definitely watch [ beats of freedom ] ( http://youtu.be/jafjzxi0hio ), 
  how about birra moretti ? 
  is it a popular beer in italy ? 
  i 'm actually a bit surprised you do n't list starporamen as one of the best ones . 
  it really is very good beer !, 
  [ i actually went for a shopping last year ] ( http://imageshack.us/a/img651/2570/imag0251y.jpg ) , just to find out what 's the best polish beer . 
  from all of the ones in the basket , perla chmielowa won . 
  i know i did not taste the fancy ones , from small breweries , i decided to try the popular ones , that you can get from tesco or any other shop . 
  kilkenny draught is just pure heaven !, 
  [ 80 millions / 80 milionow ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqzpifhk0b4 ) - its a relatively new polish movie , from 2011 . 
  its a story about a group of young solidarity activists decide to play va banque and organize a rash action to take out 80 million of the union money from one of the wroclaw 's banks before the account would be blocked . 
  security service officers follow their steps . 
  also , something a bit different , [ beats of freedom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jafjzxi0hio ) - beats of freedom is a story about polish rock music and independence . 
  narrated by a well known british writer and journalist , chris salewicz , this documentary film is a journey through three decades of polish rock . 
  chris meets with legends of the polish music scene and shows us unique footage of their first concerts as well as archives of polish history under communism . 
  is an absolute class movie !, 
  you 've forgot about silesians , vast majority of upper silesians have families in germany and thats from where we were getting packages during the communism times  also , silesian culture is mostly influenced by german , the whole silesian dialect for example is a mix of polish and german languages . 
  but still , he 's to old to go to jail so in fact the sentence will remain on the paper only . 
  well , we had many other true heroes in our history and indeed sobieski is one of them . 
  * `` you ca n't destroy the polish national-consciousness or poles on the battlefield , but if you give them power , they will destroy themselves '' - otto von bismarck . 
  * looking at our politicians now , i 'd say his words are not far from the truth . 
  without a single doubt , [ witold pilecki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) . 
  during world war ii , he ** volunteered for a polish resistance operation to get imprisoned at auschwitz in order to gather intelligence and escape . 
  ** while in the camp , pilecki organized a resistance movement and as early as 1941 , informed the western allies of nazi germany 's auschwitz atrocities . 
  he escaped from the camp in 1943 after nearly 3 years of imprisonment . 
  pilecki took part in the warsaw uprising in august 1944 . 
  for me , he was an absolute hero !, 
  you should blame nature , no iceland for that , 
  `` you can take our lives and our freedom , but you can not take our honour . 
  we are defenseless but not honourless . '', 
  - otto wels , spd chairman , the only member of reichstag to speak against hitler 's enabling act , he said that words looking directly at hitler . 
  maybe it was n't the proudest moment but certainly a moment [ as well as a person ] , that should make you proud . 
  you should also be proud of how you 've deffended yourself against the soviets in [ winter war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ), 
  well , you can also share it with united kingdom . 
  also , speaking about tensions now , well , i live in belfast and from what i see , trobules and riots now are more realted to youngsters who just want to have fun throwing stuff on completely passive police forces than something really related to what the actual `` troubles '' were about and indeed it can be embarasing : - / but all this people are just a tiny minority that is trying to rule over the vast majority of decent , fantastic and good people of northern ireland . 
  anyway , as a pole , i 'd add [ jedwabne pogrom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedwabne_pogrom ) to our list of a shameful moments in history . 
  well , it partially truth , but ... 
  i 'd say : do n't like the russians very much ... untill they meet one  i 'm polish , living in northern ireland sice 2005 and i 've met many russians here and i must say , apparently we poles can increadibly easy find a common language and talk like two old friends with russians [ even without vodka  ], 
  i can clarify that for you . 
  when i 've read his comments i knew straight away where he got that news from . 
  there 's a news portal , called wpolityce.pl that basically presents conservative right wing views . 
  apparently ... its not a berlin lawyer , its a polish lawyer piotr dubera who just filled a prosecution in a berlin court . 
  do n't worry man . 
  see , i 'm silesian ( from oberschlesien ) , just because of that , guys like @splash_damage_ are calling me not a real pole , for some of them i 'm a german , they do n't care my grand-grand father got virtuti militari - the highest military decoration for heroism and courage in the face of enemy at war , because he was fighting for poland . 
  for some of them i 'm just a second class citizen , a `` hidden german option '' , as their leader jaroslaw kaczynski used to say about silesians . 
  honestly , there 's no point to talk to him . 
  well , let me tell you something . 
  thats never gon na happen , you know why ? 
  the answer is simple , you are focusing on one tv series , or a few news articles that wrote `` polish concentration camps '' and not because someone tried to `` fix '' some history facts but , because of just simple lack of basic knowledge or simply an ignorance ( all newspapers and magazines published a correction after that anyway ! ) . 
  on the other hands ... you have loads of documentaries , loads of movies and last but not least , loads of people in many countries ( and that also includes germany of course ! ), 
  that remembers very well what holocaust was as well as who was responsible for it ( no , not nazi 's , but germans and even a german guy will name it , believe me ) . 
  your problem is your ignorance . 
  you just do n't see or just do n't want to see the fact that everyone despite of nationality knows very well who were the bad guys back then . 
  there is only one truth about world war ii , nazis and holocaust and we all know it and no one will ever `` re-write '' those history facts . 
  as a side note . 
  you should read this article to see how israel keeps holocaust memories alive . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22892783 p.s. 
  i 'm also polish , by the way and i 'm really fed up with such a moaning !, 
  folks , just do n't bother to talk to katsas_pl , there 's no point , he knows everything better . 
  apparently he 's one of these we really have a problem with in poland . 
  they are unhappy of everything , does n't like germans , russians , jews , muslims and ... anyone who does n't think like him . 
  well , every country has such minority ... so just do n't bother , he 's not interested in facts anyway .
