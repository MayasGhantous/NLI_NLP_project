  many things can upset minorities including caricatures of religious figures on a t-shirt for example . 
  yet no one is senteced year in prison for that . 
  and building is inanimate object . 
  throwing bacon at the people would be another story ... 
  well make an offer then , 
  yesterday probably . 
  the amount of snow seems about right . 
  sadly for the past 8-10 years this city is plagued by `` developers '' that build huge and ugly apartment buildings . 
  and destroy old monuments in the process ... by setting them on fire . 
   funny thing - that 's illegal under polish law no it 's completely legal since card payments are not compulsory under polish law . 
  store owner does n't have to accept card payments at all . 
  those signs may breach contract with the banks though . 
  but are not illegal per se . 
  ok here 's another one . 
  take a closer look at exports of small arms , light weapons ( salw ) and their ammunition . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/atag/2015/572805/eprs_ata ( 2015 ) 572805_en . pdf hmm interesting ... 
  did you read those two articles ? 
  oh really ? 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-arms-exports-iduskcn0wg1bh http://www.dw.com/en/weapons-go-to-conflict-zones-the-money-comes-to-germany/a-18798104  germany delivered nearly 13 million euros in weapons to syria between 2002 and 2013 - mainly tanks , chemical agents and small arms . 
  in 2014 , germany also delivered 8,000 heckler & koch g36 and g3 assault rifles to peshmerga fighters in syria . 
  winter capital - zne . 
  had 20mb/s for 69 z\u0142 / month ( 49 for net and 20 for `` line maintenance '' ) . 
  which in reality was 16mb/s , two months later 12mb/s and so on until it stopped working ( fifth month of contract ) entirely . 
  technician came the next day and said the line is damaged ( no wonder it 's hanging between two houses for 20 years ) and they need to dig in the garden and place new one there . 
  the rapair date was postponed 4 times . 
  1.5 month later they started repair job , but there 's no way to get excavator in the area they need to dig . 
  they need to do this by hand which i assume is to much of a work because they leaved the pipes for the cable in my yard and never returned  let 's just say i have lte now which have its own quirks but at least it 's working ( 30z\u0142 month ) . 
  this is very good news for rural areas . 
  where telecom companies simply wo n't invest . 
  to few clients to be worth the hassle . 
  when it comes to infrastructure in the cities though . 
  either telecom companies should be obliged to upgrade , or whole infrastructure should be taken over by the governments , upgraded and then rented back . 
  as it stands now these companies just milk the clients . 
  the eu should also take a closer look at the contracts offered to the consumers . 
  do n't know the situation at other countries but in here ( poland ) the consumer has basically no rights . 
  will give you example : in place where i live there are only two options to get the internet . 
  either lte from phone companies or broadband from orange . 
  contract is written in such a way that guaranties only the minimal up/down speed ( 1mb/s if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
  they 're selling you internet `` up to 20 mb/s '' but what you get depends on infrastructure . 
  so it 's like buying a cat in a bag . 
  the other thing is every contract is a `` promotion '' . 
  this is simply the way to bypass huge fines put on consumers that breached the contract . 
  which was made illegal . 
  now everything is `` promotion '' and if you breach the contract you have to return it . 
  so pay a huge fine ... on top of all that . 
  if you do n't have landline phone from this company . 
  you have to pay additional monthly fee called `` line maintenance '' . 
  office job at the rtv/agd store . 
  nothing special . 
  shifting papers and such . 
  the best part is she ( the boss ) offered me a job as a salesman instead . 
  despite having experience working in the office . 
  and none at all working as a salesman ... 
  did n't took it :p, 
  so funny considering i 've recently being told `` we would prefer a woman to be honest '' at a job interview . 
  heheh, 
  come on !, 
  at least they 'll vote on it . 
  democracy yay !, 
  `` do n't know '' means `` i do n't care '' , `` leave me alone '' , `` i 'm late ... '' :p, 
   if you mean terrorism against enemy , then that doesnt require training . 
  guerilla warfare is terrorism basically but pointed against occupant . 
  that 's why i 've used that word . 
  and yes it requires training . 
  gathering intel , picking targets that hurt the enemy instead random ones . 
  organising chain of command , communication network etc. 
   those from the national guard or armed forces can not . 
  their indentities are already compromised . 
  the gru will knock on their doors , if they wont answer , their family members will . 
  it 's practically impossible to contain every single person connected to military and or patriotic organization . 
  simply not going to happen . 
  most if not all partisan groups had ex soldiers involved in it one way or the other . 
  usually in commanding positions . 
   so do i. 
  the miltary storages will be looted first thing . 
  source - yugo wars . 
  the information is public , and the security does n't exist . 
  storages will be looted first by people that know about them in the first place . 
  so people like you and people connected with patriotic/military organizations . 
  oridinary citizen have no idea where those are simply because they 're not interested . 
   completely useless . 
  the military aspect of war will be disabled by russian ews , without the radios - its just going to be scaterred groups . 
  see my point about training . 
  ok . you have a point . 
  but do you honestly believe that any country would train volunteers guerilla walfare ? 
  or at least would any country openly admit that they 're doing that ? 
  everybody that wa n't to be trained in terrorism please fill this ballot , the course is free and fun . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  as long as these people are not thrown into direct fight or merged with the military they can easily transform into guerilla . 
  simply because : 1 . 
  they have access to guns . 
  or at least they know where weapon magazines are located . 
  already have a team of trained and fit people they trust . 
  they have basic knowledge of how military operates . 
  that 's pretty good start . 
  it 's not humans - it 's that bastard [ gregg ... the grim reaper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tej3kd2x5c ) and this artcile is [ great mighty poo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdd4rblsj2o ), 
   `` we would like to tell the french people that we will never give in . 
  we will not give in to the terrorist threat . 
  the times have changed , and france is going to have to live with terrorism . '' the media took this to mean that terrorism was the `` new normal , '' but that 's not what valls meant -- back in february , he said , `` we must be fully conscious of the treat , and react with very great force and great lucidity . 
  there will be attacks .
