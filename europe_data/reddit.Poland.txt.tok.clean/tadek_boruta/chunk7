  it 's closer so i 've been there like 15-20 times for longer stays ( ski trips , holidays etc ) . 
  and about 200-300 times just to buy booze . 
  when it was cheap . 
  and i love langosze ... mniam . 
  and logical thing to do next will be to compare german and foreign population at that time in the country . 
  which is what ? 
  9 % of the whole population ? 
  here are some stats . 
  german foreign prison population = 27.1 % ( 31.3.2011 ) . 
  german foreign population ( census of 2011 ) = 9.5 % sources : http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/germany http://www.statistik-portal.de/statistik-portal/en/en_jb01_jahrtab2.asp, 
  former presidents sadly had this protection till 2006 . 
   wyszkoski initially lost because back then wyszkolski did n't even have even enough proof that could be even argued that walensa was a tw . 
  as he appeled more stuff surfaced ( not nesseserly meaning more legit ) . 
  this is what i was saying . 
  during appeals more stuff resurfaced . 
  stuff like sb major testified that he was tw . 
  one of two historians ( the other one could not testify court decided ) presented paper he received from chech ipn equivalent statting wa\u0142\u0119sa was tw . 
  and so on . 
  out of 90 evidences presented by wyszkowski not even half of them was taken into consideration by the court . 
  i do n't understand why you 're arguing with me on this . 
  i said the wa\u0142\u0119sa can not sue anybody for saying that he was tw . 
  and that he already lost such case with wyszkowski . 
  not that court decided wa\u0142\u0119sa was tw . 
  the only difference of opinion here appears to be that . 
  you think evidences presented by wyszkowski did not matter in the end . 
  and i think they did . 
  considering how harsh the courts where at the beginning and how soft they become in the end . 
  based on this i 'm still certain that nobody will get sued over this . 
  even if those papers found in kiszczak house are fake . 
  which i doubt . 
  does n't make sense to keep fake documents as leverage . 
   so wyszkowski can say whatever he wants even with flimsiest evidence because walesa is public figure . 
  he is also former president . 
  so no . 
  wyszkowski or anybody else can not say whatever he wants about him based on flimsy evidence . 
  especially on public tv . 
  that 's why this case took 9 years . 
  and why initially wyszkowski lost . 
  he lost a case against wyszkowski who openly stated that he was tw `` bolek '' and that he received money from sb . 
  court did not have to confirm if wa\u0142\u0119sa was bolek or not . 
  because lawsuit was not about this . 
  but what court did confirm is that there 's is enough evidence pointing in that direction that anybody can call him tw bolek without fear of offending him and repercussions . 
  so wa\u0142\u0119sa can not sue onet or ipn because he will lose . 
  and ipn did not confirm anything yet . 
  end of story ... 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa already lost such case with krzysztof wyszkowski so i doubt it 'll happen . 
  thank you . 
  i think it 's just poorly worded . 
  `` in the opinion of an exeprt-archivist participating in the activities ... '' so it 's no confirmation at all . 
  can you link to the `` confimation '' bit please ? 
  can not find it on ipn site . 
  who knows . 
  but ipn did not confirmed anything . 
  \u0141ukasz kami\u0144ski just said that they appear to be authentic . 
  slight difference but it 's there . 
  another interesting fact is that kiszczak unsent letter was found dated 1996 stating that bolek was indeed wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  so right after president term of office ended . 
  imagine the shit storm then  somebody must have payed kiszczak on regular basis to not reveal these documents . 
  hell he told his wife that if she ever needs money go to ipn and sell them ... 
  ipn did not `` suddenly '' returned to this case . 
  kiszczak 's wife tried to sell them . 
  which is illegal by the way . 
  everybody knew that kiszczak had papers on people . 
  otherwise he 'd be in jail long time ago . 
  i 'm interested who else turns out to be an agent . 
  i bet half the country `` elite '' shat their pants when news came out about papers found in his house . 
  and let 's not forget that wa\u0142\u0119sa received materials sb had on him to `` view '' . 
  when he returned it , ~ 200 pages were missing ... 
  yeah but bible is not taken literally . 
  also nowhere does the bible claim to be inerrant . 
  quite the opposite . 
  2 timothy 3:16 `` all scripture is inspired by god and is useful for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness . '', 
  do n't know about that . 
  my friend had a girlfriend and when they decided to marry . 
  it turned out they were related ( distant cousins ) . 
  and church said no . 
  the official statement is that second-cousin marriages are allowed , and , under some circumstances , a dispensation can be obtained to allow a first-cousin marriage . 
  the church still discourages such marriages , however . 
  how it works in practice depends on where you live i presume . 
  it 's a pipe . 
  gas could be delivered to it from any source nearby ( deals have to made of course ) . 
  small connection to gas terminal and that 's it . 
  there are other routes taken into consideration of course . 
  and at this point many things can change . 
  ehh why not . 
  my counter argument is this : german foreign prison population = 27.1 % ( 31.3.2011 ) . 
  german foreign population ( census of 2011 ) = 9.5 % sources : http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/germany http://www.statistik-portal.de/statistik-portal/en/en_jb01_jahrtab2.asp and to be honest it 's a decent score . 
  considering they have no social status ( except few ) at the start . 
  but low social status leads to crime . 
  this is a problem that ca n't be ignored and swept under the rug . 
  and what certain countries are doing is concerning to say the least . 
  another thing that ca n't be ignored is , way to many people in the muslim world are dedicated ( in speech and action ) to destroying the western civilization . 
  i 'm not talking about small groups of radicals here . 
  good explanation why they matter : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry3nzkaoo3s and last thing - religion . 
  what 's so bad about their religion ? 
  the fact that it 's not only religion but also a political system . 
  one that 's exact opposite of ours ( eu ) . 
  those two things are not separate like in christianity for example . 
  `` give back to caesar what is caesar 's and to god what is god 's . '', 
  this is a huge issue and in my opinion the biggest reason why muslims do not integrate well .
