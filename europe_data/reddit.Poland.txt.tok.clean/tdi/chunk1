in polish it is `` ma\u0142pa '' . 
  my dream is to have ma\u0142pa.pl domain , so i could have malpa@malpa.pl email address . 
  then i could say : hey my email address is ma\u0142pa ma\u0142pa ma\u0142pa pl . 
  lol everybody knows albania does not exist . 
  is is not that slovakia occupied czech rep ? 
  i saw 5 slovaks going with rifles towards czech border . 
  maybe there is a room for social endeavour to track such companies and force them to change . 
  although there is a national language council that should be on it . 
  great to know . 
  thanks . 
  in poland i think it is due to laziness , and not giving a damn by the youngsters , who first adopt new technologies . 
  podejmuj\u0119 is a better word . 
  i remember times when bank did not support diacritics on their credit cards . 
  commonwealth is more or less a good translation of rzeczpospolita . 
  i once new a guy with name `` d\u017con '' , written like that . 
  nice , a train rail that nobody in poland will be able to afford a ticket , 
  `` user theothor , whose butt ( or his ancestor 's butts ) we saved during the wwii is not from france . 
  his nick has a nederlands flag - a little similar to france 's flag , but reversed . '', 
  that is the translation . 
  you can add comment there  i have no fb account so i ca n't, 
  zubr\u00f3wka is not polish capital anymore . 
  maybe he was in pozna\u0144 . 
  it is in fact clean . 
  morskie oko ( eye of a sea ), 
  in fact nope . 
  the most succesful game in terms of money earned is dead island . 
  maybe there should be also a map of colloquial names , in poland : - browar - browiec - piwko - bronek, 
  i know they are very friendly people . 
  i know many people keep guns after the war and practice by shooting at road signs . 
  that is why they have holes . 
  many streets in tirana have holes because of stolen sewer doors ( metal round things ) . 
  many buildings in tirana are colourful because the mayor wanted the city to be more colourful . 
  the country is very beautiful but there is much litter everywhere because people dump things wherever they want ( rivers , lakes ) 6 . 
  in albanian the name of the country is shqip\u00ebria . 
  people in albania like to have nice and expensive cars and keep them very tidy . 
  that is why you can find a car wash on every corner . 
  for me kashubians are just poles . 
  i am happy they have their own language but do not treat them as different nation and especially not different race . 
  it is funny why we poles answered that . 
  in our country there are almost none people from other races . 
  no i do not :(, 
  does it count when you live with your parents in a big castle ? 
  belarus is partially isolated country ( dictatorship ) and hermetical to some extend . 
  in such environments something can get popular even though it is not outside . 
  i second that . 
  i agree , this trend can be seen already . 
  20 years ago nobody would even mention homosexuals , now the debate is in parliament . 
  the form of the debate is rather shameful but yet it is . 
  seems like progress . 
  nice , you gave poland our old lands . 
  thank you very much . 
  some legend ? 
  germany lost land , poland lost too . 
  we lost our finest city of lw\u00f3w , we gained mostly german cities , wroc\u0142aw , danzig and stettin . 
  i am surprised that poland is not worse . 
  good job heimat . 
  i am not saying helsinki is the most beautiful city , just the best for me . 
  i always try to assess a city with a question `` would it be nice to live here permanently ? 
  of course this is very subjective but in helsinki i like : * fresh air , * small traffic , * no high buildings , skycrapers * all in a walking distance * city with see but not in a ` miami beach way ' , * metro , trams are present  * proximity to nature , * finnish people have good quiet vibe to them . 
  i could just move there ... but finnish taxes ... 
  yes many people go there for weekends . 
  brits mostly but you have direct flights from amsterdam . 
  hehe nope it is not . 
  krakow is great though . 
   problem with helsinki is that it 's more expensive than any other place in finland , and it does n't have enough apartments because people from all over finland want to move to helsinki , but rarely away from there . 
  also most of the helsinki is in peninsula which is fixed in size and there is no more place to put new apartments there . 
  hence the prices . 
  so in my opinion helsinki is the best city i have been to . 
  but what do i know i am from poland . 
  why are there no finns ? 
  poor finland ... 
  the worst is that people fear going out in their own city . 
  polish unemployment rate is 9.7 % and is the lowest since 2007 i think . 
  yes but the goods and amount of goods that is exported by rich countries is way higher than by the poor ones . 
  some day this situation can balance , for this day to come faster than later funds are provided . 
  we ( poor countries ) did not make these rules , ue funding countries did , we just accepted and joined . 
  i am not a native , maybe deserve is a bit too strong word . 
  what i wanted to say it is fair if it is bilateral . 
  as a pole i think we new countries deserve funds . 
  it is not one way deal - rich countries pay but get something in return . 
  they get free access to new markets , because of funds these markets get richer and spend more . 
  the trick is to take back some of these funds back in export profits . 
  for all of you interested in recipe i give you offical one from poznan site ( translated ) : ** dough ** * 1kg wheat flour * 6 eggs * 0.5 butter piece ( 125g ) * 2 spoons of sugar * 50g of yeasts * 1 glass of milk ( 250ml ) ** filling ** * 1.5 glass of powder sugar ( 375ml ) * 200g of nuts and almonds * 100g of white poppy procedure : add yeasts to a small amount of milk . 
  mash eggs with sugar and mix with molded butter . 
  while mashing add flour , milk and previously prepared yeasts . 
  work on dough to the moment when small air bubbles appear . 
  after that leave dough until it `` grows '' . 
  boil almonds , nuts and poppy , mash and sugar and sour cream until it is dense . 
  roll the dough and cut into squares . 
  put the filling on each of the squares , form croissants and leave in warm place . 
  put into a warm oven and bake in 200-250 celsius degress until rogale are golden . 
  ; sorry for mistakes , i am not expert cooking words . 
  but beware rogal swietomarcinski is a registered ue product , this name can be only given to rogals produced in certified bakeries in greater poland . 
  so probably in dublin it will be called some other name but be the same . 
  i was raised on olsen 's gang, 
  is there such a thing like `` french brewery '' ? 
  these two words do not fit to each other . 
  very nice idea . 
  poland seems legit . 
  in poland first aid kit is also obligatory,
