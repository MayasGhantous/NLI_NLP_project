  so you do n't mind giving it up then ? 
  tough on crime is one thing , but 12 years for that ? 
  poland needs to chill . 
  i like the bottom two thirds . 
  not sure about the top through . 
  i think jail time would be a better solution to this problem . 
  no one 's going to take a fine this small seriously enough to stop . 
  so let 's , once and for all , dispel this myth that angela merkel does n't know what she is doing . 
  she knows exactly what she is doing . 
  angela merkel is undertaking a systematic effort to change this union , to make europe more like the third world . 
  that 's why she opened the borders . 
  it used to be that you could check gender by looking at dna . 
  it no longer matters what your little machine says . 
  times have changed . 
  that does n't absolve the dutch from this . 
  their school system is producing these people . 
  and who 's to say that 's a bad thing . 
  societies come and go and the world still spins . 
  not so innocent then are they, 
  can the eu vote to get rid of germany ? 
  seems they 're causing all our problems, 
  without america , what will stop russia from taking europe ? 
  can we build up an army in time ? 
  i do n't advocate for putting either russians or americans on trial . 
  show trials are n't a solution . 
  it 's not a double standard . 
  america is our ally , russia is not . 
  that 's why they have troops here . 
  using the reason of `` they are not our allies , therefore put them on trial '' does n't make sense , since the point of a judicial system is to make things appear fair . 
  if you want to punish russia , go ahead , but a trial would be just for show . 
  this what-aboutism is the irrelevant type . 
  if it was said `` we wo n't house russian troops because of their war crimes '' , then it would make sense to ask the question , `` why would you house american troops even though they have similar war crimes ? '' . 
  if the topic is rather prosecuting russia for war crimes , then a relevant question would by `` why not prosecute others as well ? 
  is there something wrong with it though ? 
  all it implies is that both countries should be held to a similar standard . 
  it only becomes nonsense if you what-about something irrelevant . 
  what-abouting war crimes seems relevant . 
  i have n't personally talked about this with anyone but found debate online . 
  i did n't mean to say that many people interested in euthenasia without personal consent . 
  just that they exist . 
  the issue with that definition is that in the future it must be possible to sustain a fetus from day 1 . 
  it 's a problem with the definition of a human , and about the ethics of who should have the right to end another persons life . 
  most people agree a human exists at least starting from birth . 
  catholics believe the human person begins at conception . 
  then , once you agree about who a human is , you have to decide who is allowed to kill them . 
  many people agree that criminals should be executed , and that the sick and old should be euthanized . 
  whether it requires their consent is also debatable . 
  for example , some ethicist believe that post birth abortions are morally correct , when it is in the `` best interest '' of the child and its parents . 
  catholics believe that executions should not be an option in the modern world , even for criminals , and that euthanasia is morally wrong in every case . 
  with consent or otherwise . 
  why is our flag upside down ? 
  also , hungary . 
  no , they beat them out of love, 
  was william forbes-sempill not a true scotsman ? 
  did he become japanese ? 
  the only definition we have today of nationality is what your papers say . 
  who decides who should hold french citizenship ? 
  how many and which `` bad things '' do you need to do ? 
  is there a difference between someone who has french citizenship and someone who is french ? 
   culturally french what does that mean ? 
  for example , were/are jacques barrot , micha\u00ebl blanc , claudine de culam culturally french ? 
  if so , is embezzlement , drug trafficking , and bestiality culturally french ? 
  no true scotsman ? 
   lead judge ulrich polachowski is it just a coincidence that they chose a polish sounding judge to preside over the murder trial of a polish person ? 
  that can also be dangerous . 
  what if a friend or family member is a loyalist, 
  with a million + new citizens , there would probably a few terrorists would n't there ? 
  they have a `` weak negotiating position '' because of nord stream .

   just when russian companies thought they had adjusted to the sanctions imposed by the west three years ago following moscow 's annexation of crimea , corporate lawyers have been sent scrambling back to their desks . 
    the us senate on wednesday moved to reinforce and enlarge the restrictions on russia 's most critical companies , dashing any remaining hopes that washington under president donald trump would ease ties with moscow and putting a dent in the russian stock market . 
    while the senate vote will need to be approved by the house of representatives , the proposed bill will codify existing sanctions into law , making them far harder to lift . 
  it also adds new restrictions , most notably relating to pipeline projects for oil and gas , privatisations of state-owned assets and the threat of restrictions on russian sovereign debt and derivatives . 
    the new broadside from washington could renew nervousness and discomfort among foreign investors in the country that followed the imposition of the original sanctions . 
  many companies , such as oil major exxonmobil , suspended russian investment projects while banks cut off financing to local businesses . 
    `` this is about creating a threat , '' said an executive at a company targeted by the sanctions . 
  `` they have opened their toolbox again . ''   the most prominent target is the contentious nord stream 2 pipeline , which is set to start pumping gas from russia to europe in 2019 , and is a flagship project for kremlin-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . 
    `` it sanctions those who . 
  invest or support the construction of russian energy export pipelines , '' mike crapo , a republican senator from idaho who co-authored the amendment , said of the new proposal . 
    us opposition to the pipeline , which critics say is a geopolitical power play by gazprom to increase its dominance of europe 's energy supply , could become a big headache for the project 's european partners shell , engie , omv , wintershall and uniper , who have agreed to pay half of the $ 9.5 bn cost . 
    officials at the companies involved , speaking on condition of anonymity , told the ft that they were studying the legal framework under which the us would be able to levy sanctions on them . 
    the senate also voted to sanction any individual who invests $ 10m or more , or facilitates such an investment , in a sale of russian state-owned assets . 
  if passed into law , this could heavily restrict the ability of us investors to take part in privatisations of russian companies , either as buyers or brokers . 
    even without house ratification , the senate vote `` is clearly negative '' , moscow-based research house bcs global markets said in a note to clients . 
  `` it demonstrates how remote , difficult and protracted the process of normalising us-russia relations is . ''   moscow 's benchmark micex index of shares fell as much as 4.2 per cent on thursday and closed at its lowest level since february 2016 , while the yield on the country 's five-year debt rose . 
  shares in rosneft , the country 's largest oil producer and a company heavily targeted by sanctions , closed 1.1 per cent lower . 
  sberbank , russia 's biggest bank , lost 2.1 per cent . 
    hopes of an easing of sanctions under mr trump spurred a surge of foreign investment into russia 's economy in the first few months of his administration , but his more hawkish rhetoric in office has punctured that optimism . 
    `` during the campaign , trump was expressing a completely different approach towards developing relationships with russia , '' igor sechin , rosneft 's chief executive told the ft in a recent interview . 
  `` but as soon as he became president , they started pressing him . 
  those who were imposing the sanctions , they started setting conditions . ''   the first wave of sanctions coincided with a 50 per cent fall in the price of oil , russia 's most important export , pitching the economy into recession . 
  but since then the economy has limped back into growth . 
    targeted companies , such as rosneft and its oil producing rivals lukoil and gazprom neft , have broadly restructured to operate with few ill effects , having replaced foreign credit with local funding and developed in-house technology to replace foreign expertise . 
    the senate vote on wednesday called for sanctions to be expanded to the country 's transport , metals , shipping and mining industries , without providing specific details . 
    but the inclusion of a provision in the senate bill for officials to explore the potential of expanding restrictions to encompass sovereign debt and all derivative products , would be a `` real intensification '' of the sanctions , said oleg kouzmin , chief russia economist at renaissance capital . 
    the study , to be conducted within 180 days of the bill being passed , could have serious implications for russian companies ' ability to manage liquidity , said luis saenz , co-head of equity and trading at bcs global markets . 
    `` think about it as if american financial institutions ca n't use t-bills as collateral . 
  not as severe , but in that ballpark , '' he said .
