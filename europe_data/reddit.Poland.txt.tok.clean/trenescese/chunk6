  our last acts were well received by the public . 
  fuck the jury .

  basque country pls start in eurovision . 
  all those songs except georgia sound the same . 
  i think it 's the only tune so far i would be able to listen to on my own !, 
  i 'm tired over arguing on reddit . 
   with rising automation `` robots are stealing are jobs ! '', 
  fallacy , vol . 
  242314 reddit never disappoints . 
  decentralisation is the way to go . 
  sadly , eu officials think otherwise . 
  and like with every controversial protest , you ought to take average of police and official reports to get real numbers . 
  good decision . 
  but they are paying . 
  in liechtenstein . 
  hans-adam ii is a wonderful ruler . 
  i 'd like to shamelessly advert his book on his views about what a state is and how it should be ruled : [ the state in the third millennium ] ( https://www.amazon.com/state-third-millennium-prince-hans-adam/dp/3905881047 ), 
  do n't worry , czech constitutional amendment will stop that gun law . 
  freedom of speech ... 
  well , people mad about it have only themselves to blame then . 
   edit : i forgot . 
  kurds do n't really exist . 
  they are called mountain turks . 
  slovaks do n't really exist . 
  they are called mountain hungarians . 
  of course !, 
  actually not , i 'd support every separatist movement there is in the world . 
  decentralization is good . 
  i wish best of luck to scots , basques , catalonia , venice etc. 
  i just cringe at almost religious levels of support for eu at this subreddit . 
  remember : someone leaves eu - bad , someone leave uk to stay in eu - good, 
   right now he 's just calling everybody and i mean everybody a nazi . 
  hey , you can now feel like a right-winger feels on reddit . 
  fun experience . 
  european superstate is the only way forward you dummy / s, 
  hurray for decentralization !, 
  well , best polish rulers were usually foreign ( batory , jagiello , vladislav iv ) , 
  even though [ 54 % of poles agree that tusk should have received poland 's vote in ec ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/7,75399,21471324,polacy-chca-by-rzad-poparl-donalda-tuska-na-szefa-rady-europejskiej.html ) , [ 63 % are against him returning to poland and becoming the leader of opposition ] ( http://www.newsweek.pl/polska/powrot-donalda-tuska-do-polskiej-polityki-wyniki-sondazu-millward-brown,artykuly,402632,1.html ) . 
  he does n't seem concerned about returning to poland right now , but never said it 's not gon na happen . 
  i know it does n't directly answer your question . 
  / r/madlads she 's actually ( not ) doing it, 
  was the vote public ? 
  tusk was the only good politician poland ever had . 
  he did n't achieve very much , but the feat of not fucking up and not implementing any absolutely disastrous policies throughout his whole term is yet to be equaled by any other government . 
  i need eye bleach . 
  hear , hear . 
  leftists fail to understand those things . 
  no stripes , not traditional . 
  you 're right , i ought to do that, 
  thatcher !, 
  well , free trade would be beneficial to both post-brexit uk and eu . 
  i do n't see any reason for not doing free trade with uk . 
   my opinion , naturally , being someone who supports remain naturally , of course !, 
  i 'm such an enlightened person !, 
  how can anyone even think about leaving the eu being a good thing ? 
  get off of your moral superiority horse . 
  `` anything against eu is populism '' - media these days, 
  stop it 'd be too much, 
  who would downvote this lovely lady ? 
  bigger government = corporations have more power over you . 
  how are post-war struggles of a country relevant to effects of capitalism ? 
   full capitalism would imply no ** public ** regulations , ~ ~ minimal ~ ~ ** no ** state , no ** public ** social security , no public health service ** \u2713 ** , no ** public ** free education oh no , it 's this meme again  socialism , like the ancient ideas from which it springs , confuses the distinction between government and society . 
  as a result of this , every time we object to a thing being done by government , the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all . 
  we disapprove of state education . 
  then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education . 
  we object to a state religion . 
  then the socialists say that we want no religion at all . 
  we object to a state-enforced equality . 
  then they say that we are against equality . 
  and so on , and so on . 
  it is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain . 
  bastiat, 
  yup , germans had nothing to do with it, 
   nazi germany germany *, 
   many nazi concentration camps german *, 
   wesprzyi this ortography makes me feel like it 's 1920 all over again, 
  a slave is someone forced to do things he does n't want to , when he does not break other people 's rights . 
  ( i do n't know if i worded that right - i mean that attacking someone and getting beaten up in return is , obviously , not slavery ), 
  swiss providing the burn . 
  the only time that my community reached / r/all . 
  thanks to this gif . 
  kaczy\u0144ski 's government , even though it calls itself conservative , has almost exactly the same narrative like the communist governments from people 's republic of poland times . 
  steering public opinion against `` the enemies of the nation/working class '' , the big bad elites/bourgeoisie who destroy everything , etc. 
  seems like a pretty good strategy to stay in power , as his party still has plurality of support ( and lost almost none since the election ) , but a bad way to rule the country ... kaczy\u0144ski is a reincarnation of evil . 
  i just wish our opposition parties were n't so bad , it 's like choosing between being raped and only beaten up . 
  the latter is of course better , but you still do n't feel good about letting yourself to get fucked up . 
  what i meant is that in your analogy , uk would be called england . 
  it 's not racism if it 's against white people !, 
  after 3rd may 1791 it 's ( commonwealth of ) poland , not plc , if we want to be strictly correct . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reciprocal_guarantee_of_two_nations  the document declared that the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ( now to be known as rzeczpospolita polska , the polish republic , or polish commonwealth ) remained a union of the crown of the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania . 
   some report that opposition mps were not allowed inside the room , although i 've seen no confirmed reports of that . 
  bullshit , one of mps ( liroy ) did a livestream on facebook and he could enter and exit the chamber as he liked to . 
  speaker of the sejm wants to change press access rules to be more european ( more restrictive , currently polish press has much more freedom in the parliament than there is in the west ) , he does n't need sejm 's approval to do that - it was announced yesterday 2 . 
  today there is voting on 2017 budget ; during questions phase , oppositions mps abused formal motions and their questions , instead showing their support to current press rules . 
  [ often , they hung out a sheet of paper with '' #freemediainsejm '' written on it on the rostrum during their speeches . 
  a rather curiosical thing happened - when one of the opposition mps did the same thing with the sheet of paper during his turn to speak , opposition mps started to chant so it was impossible for him to ask a question . 
  speaker of the house decided that it was the fault of mp who had been speaking then , and decided to ban him from sejm proceedings .
