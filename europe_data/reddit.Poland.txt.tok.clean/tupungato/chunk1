some people say so , because we are a very homogeneous culture . 
  people are afraid of new stuff . 
  there are no mosques in poland . 
  you have to travel abroad ( or to a big city ) to meet a non-white person . 
  i think in every country you can find lots of generous people and lots of assholes . 
  some 10 years ago there was a visiting group of singers ( a christian choir ) from ivory coast in my town . 
  after the concert the organizer said that the singers did n't expect september to be so cold in poland ( it was maybe 10 \u00b0 c ) and they clothes were not warm enough . 
  it took only an hour for local community to organize winter jackets and shoes for ~ 20 singers . 
  they ticket controllers are usually quite pushy indeed . 
  as a student i also paid a fine once . 
  it was the first day of the month and i forgot to sign my freshly bought monthly ticket . 
  i visited bulgaria in 2012 and was surprised how cheap it was relative to it 's general development . 
  after i returned to poland i looked up property prices and rent in bulgaria . 
  it was cheap . 
  i guess the western europe has n't bought all your property yet , 
  my amount might be elevated , as it currently includes loan instalments for major roof renovation . 
  i 'd re-estimate the amount as 40-80 $ of fees in apartment you own and 200-400 $ for rent of 50m apartment ( my medium sized town ) . 
  maybe we went `` overly attached girlfriend '' on them . 
  belgium is easy until your arteries are clogged with potato fries with mayonaisse . 
  there is a huge surge in nationalist attitudes in poland , fear of other culture , islam etc. 
  but even some islamophobes genuinely claim that refugees are welcome as long as they are catholics . 
  as the family was syrian catholic it was kind of a surprise and a `` slap '' that they did n't want to be here . 
  the fee for housing association for building management , chimney maintenance , staircase cleaning , staircase electricity , elevator maintenance , garbage disposal etc. 
  probably depends on the area and whom you 're interacting with . 
  i had only pleasant encounters with germans . 
  i made tourist visits to germany many times and welcomed germans in poland . 
  none of my friends ( people aged 25-35 ) would consider disliking someone for being german . 
  one of my grandmas , though , she still holds a grudge for the old times . 
  small edit : even i might happen to be beaten up for drinking in wrong crowd in poland and mentioning my town . 
  there are a lot of assholes like crazy football hooligans who do such things . 
  probably no one is going to stop them . 
  but even though you are in a schengen zone country in some cases you are legally not allowed to leave the country . 
  even in tourist visas there is a difference . 
  you can receive full schengen visa or just the visa to certain country . 
  as far as i know , refugee once registered in one country is not necessarily allowed to freely move to other countries . 
  i 'm not sure if i use the word correctly , but we have the same word in polish ( `` czynsz '' = rent ) for the monthly fee we pay to the housing association . 
  i own my apartment , but i still have to pay for building management , chimney maintenance , staircase cleaning , staircase electricity , elevator maintenance , garbage disposal etc. 
  but 700 $ definitely allows decent life in poland . 
  in my city : * rent for 50m apartment is 80 $ if you own it or 200-300 $ if you do n't own it . 
  * 60 mbit internet is 14 $ , mobile phone bill with unlimited calls is 11 $ * electricity 25 $ , water included in rent above , monthly heating averaged for whole year is 70 $ * annual property tax 20 $ * food expenses assuming you eat relatively healthy would be 100-150 $ per person per month . 
  it 's not terrible . 
  we 're definitely central !, 
  or southern nordic !, 
  never eastern . 
  never !, 
  just kidding , i 'm ok with being in eastern europe . 
  ( probably gon na change my mind if putin goes crazy . ), 
  forever homogeneous ;(,

  [ law and justice ( prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 , pis ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice ) features national conservatism , social conservatism and mild euroscepticism , but i would n't call them ultra conservative .

  some people are fleeing from war , some are just opportunists . 
  dutch journalist made himself a forged syrian passport . 
  it took 2 days and cost $ 825 . 
  how do we know who are the refugees ? 
   moving among the tens of thousands of syrian war refugees passing through the train stations of europe are many who are neither syrian nor refugees , but hoping to blend into the mass migration and find a back door to the west . 
    there are well-dressed iranians speaking farsi who insist they are members of the persecuted yazidis of iraq . 
  there are indians who do n't speak arabic but say they are from damascus . 
  there are pakistanis , albanians , egyptians , kosovars , somalis and tunisians from countries with plenty of poverty and violence , but no war .

  so , working for uber you have no boss . 
  you have no fixed hours , minimum hours . 
  you just work whenever you feel like working . 
  people make money on the side working as uber drivers two weekends in a month , 10 hours in total . 
  and they should be entitled for paid holidays for this ? 
  and a minimum wage ? 
  in poland when you visit an antique/second hand art dealer , you hear a heavy sigh before you even start talking . 
  they are sick and tired of people bringing in worthless pieces of `` art '' and most of the time will tell you stuff is worth next to nothing . 
  so people just assume most of stuff in their attics is worth nothing . 
  tea was n't an option in drinks ? 
  when i 'm telling my grandma that i 'm going somewhere abroad , she usually assumes i 'll die a terrible death . 
  `` grandma , i 'm going to france '' - `` oh no !, 
  it 's only muslims !, 
  there will be bombs , you will die !, 
  do n't go ! '', 
  `` grandma , i 'm going to japan '' - `` oh no !, 
  it 's so dangerous !, 
  japan is very dangerous ! '', 
  `` grandma , i 'm going to romania '' - `` why ?!? 
  it 's only gypsies there !, 
  they will kill you and steal everything ! '', 
  afterwards i 'll tell grandma stories that there is no gypsies , nobody killed me . 
  i 'm showing my grandma the photos . 
  it 's all beautiful . 
  but what will she tell her neighbor friend `` my grandson returned from romania !, 
  he 's so lucky he did n't die ! '' .
