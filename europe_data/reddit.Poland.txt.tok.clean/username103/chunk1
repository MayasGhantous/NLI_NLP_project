there is no set amount of people required . 
  the way it works is if the person is removed from the photo and the composition of the photo is changed then that person has the right of intellectual property of their image . 
  if the composition of the photo is not changed then no rights apply . 
  so it can apply in crowds if someone stands out . 
  this is in pl , but i assume germany is the same . 
  i 'd recommend learning the difference between russia and the soviet union . 
  only if we get to cuddle . 
  they forgot about poland as well :(, 
  for those in poland , millennium bank is offering an investment in the success of volkswagen . 
  one of my fav [ videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mbshx9fdu )  im a vodka guy but wine , beer and rum never hurt , 
  its ok to drink it neat as long as you exhale before you take it . 
  i 'll let you know about shipping , it should n't be too bad and all i would ask for in return is a bottle of your favourite australian liquor . 
   maybe you 'll rethink about going to estonia and head to poland instead . 
  [ heres a little vid ] ( http://youtu.be/q4li9taqkmw ), 
  actually , i bought it to clean thermal paste off of my cpu , but i may have had some after i was done . 
  it 's like $ 4 at the shop for 100ml ( they do sell bigger bottles ) , no idea about shipping but i can look into it for you . 
  i found this article for [ you ] ( http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/warning-over-deadly-spirits/story-e6freoof-1226244534802 ) from a few years back . 
  i made a [ french ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ksy2l9l.jpg ) one  ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ^ ^ about ^ ^ french ^ ^ military ^ ^ history ^ ^ just ^ ^ went ^ ^ with ^ ^ the ^ ^ cheap ^ ^ joke, 
  i believe that was a redneck inbred joke . 
  9/11 is also an important day in the usa . 
  were n't we meant to nuke them as well ? 
  result : denmark i wonder what i would have to answer to get poland, 
  best beer i 've ever had . 
  good guy stalin . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ dirty ^ ^ ^ writing ^ ^ ^ that . 
  i 'm sure the eu would be able to take them on if you give us 10 years of uncontrolled military spending . 
  spoiler : most people put `` i do n't know/don ' t care '', 
  for the lazy [ sweden ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1f4na6/series_what_do_you_know_about_sweden/ ) [ estonia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fe244/series_what_do_you_know_about_estonia/ ) [ turkey ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fkf9d/series_what_do_you_know_about_turkey/ ), 
  they have 3 votes ( the least ) in the council of the eu . 
  ok so i checked out your site and i do n't see any mention on the site for a reunification of east and west . 
  i 'm not against the idea of your project , i like it and would attend if i was anywhere close to strasbourg . 
  perhaps you should have picked a better title for this post . 
  - the russian ministry of foreign affairs - rossotrudnichestvo ( under the jurisdiction of the russian foreign ministry ) - russian federal agency of youth affairs three of your supporters have ties to the russian government . 
  the reunification of east and west is already happening , poland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , and romania are already in the eu . 
  the eu is struggling to absorb all these states already . 
  this seems more like a push for a greater russian influence in europe than a reunification of east and west . 
  what is it that you 'd like to see ? 
  a cultural exchange ? 
  free trade ? 
  political influence ? 
  an erasmus exchange with russian universities would be great . 
  one problem that i 've encountered is conjugating english names of things , for example skype . 
  orally i would say `` b\u0119d\u0119 na skypjie za 10 minut '' ( i 'll be on skype in ten minutes ) , written this way it just looks so wrong . 
  also , pronouncing cherry as if it was written sherry ... to jest czere\u015bnia a nie szere\u015bnia . 
  i like hope . 
  scrapping the cap would hurt the big guy and kill the little guy , all our food would come from developing countries since it would be cheaper for the consumer . 
  so in a sense , yes it would help the little guy in peru . 
  he 's italian living abroad . 
  unsc needs reform anyway ... 
  that 's what i was thinking , i 'm registered at my grandparents because i know it is a stable address where important things can be sent to . 
  living alone for 4 years now and have moved 5 times so it would be a pain in the ass to have to change my `` official '' address all those times . 
  the internet could cut in and out , lag spikes , ect . 
  upc is at 3 [ stars ] ( http://imgur.com/5msn7xu ) and i think it is a fair assessment . 
   soviets were worse than nazis well ... 
  it 's also not in the eu so it would n't be included in the least/most expensive eu capitals . 
  lets agree that the mods should determine banning on a case by case basis , not immediately . 
  i agree , a zero-tolerance policy should n't be applied , we can just report cases which we feel should be removed . 
  yes , i agree with you that there is a difference between the two statements , however neither of them ( in my opinion ) belong here . 
  sidenote : i read `` marsians '' as `` martians '' and found it funny you called aliens untermenschen . 
  for all we know they can be \u00fcbermenschen . 
  yes , it is a law which is meant to take away the abstractness of freedom of speech and set clear limits so that everyone does n't have their own opinion . 
  hate speech would be prohibited . 
  freedom of speech is not absolute . 
  article 19 of the [ iccpr ] ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm#art19 )  1 . 
  everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference . 
  everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression ; this right shall include freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds , regardless of frontiers , either orally , in writing or in print , in the form of art , or through any other media of his choice . 
  the exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities . 
  it may therefore be subject to certain restrictions , but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary : **  ( a ) for respect of the rights or reputations of others ;  ( b ) for the protection of national security or of public order ( ordre public ) , or of public health or morals . 
  article 20 paragraph 2 of the iccpr  ** 2 . 
  any advocacy of national , racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination , hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law . 
  i 'm surprised by the negative skew on american influence in europe , and the indecisiveness on an immediate ban for racism . 
  as for the country whose citizens can drink the most i 'd like to point out that there are 4 `` champs '' from poland listed [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_alcohol_content#highest_recorded_blood_alcohol_level.2fcontent ) . 
  not that i 'm promoting anything . 
  they 're coming tomorrow . 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka is made in my city !, 
   the best slivovice / \u015bliwowica / slivovica i had was slovak . 
  pils beer is great ; i have n't had czech pils though , so i ca n't compare that . 
  going by your comment history i 'm assuming that you 're greek so i feel obligated to compliment your raki . 
  i did n't intend to start a debate on whose alcohol is the best , we all know the answer ( belgian beer - particularly tripel ), 
  dear czechs , catch the bootleggers and crackdown on those selling it . 
  also , we have the good stuff in krak\u00f3w . 
  very true , i 've only been able to donate 3 times and wo n't be eligible for another 11 months . 
  to be fair , you have to donate 25l of blood to use the public transport for free in my city , and since they limit you to donating every 2 months it would take you 4 years and 4 months to earn free public transport . 
  the real reason it 's so cheap is because everything else is so expensive in norway . 
   interest rates are n't tied to the economies of several nations lol, 
  just the burger , a medium meal is 14,90 z\u0142 . 
  $ 20 is ~ 84z\u0142 right now so you can get 5 medium meals and have 9z\u0142 left over ; almost enough for a pack of marlboro lights ( 12,60 z\u0142 hardpack , 11z\u0142 softpack ) . 
  edit : also , between 1 and 1.67 g of weed that has been soaked to make it heavier . 
  i thoroughly enjoyed the [ third ] ( http://campl.us/cohyc5y397a ) paragraph here ( the defeat of ... ) . 
  i 'm studying ir so this book was fascinating for me , and like you said he does explain his reasoning , however some of his theories come off as being a little too crazy . 
  did n't he also say the us will get in a war against turkey and japan ? 
  can i ask how you got this in your mailbox ? 
  i think you should allow non-english posts onto this subreddit because they can offer a different perspective than those written in english . 
  however if someone does submit a non-english post they should expect to translate it . 
  i found [ this ] ( http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/fy11.pdf )  adjusted visa refusal rate for b visas  australia 22.7 %  argentina 2.5 %  canada 52.2 %  france 23.9 %  germany 18.6 %  poland 10.2 %  sweden 22.3 %  uruguay 3.8 % although these numbers are probably not an accurate comparison for the countries that are in the vwp because normal citizens do n't need to apply , only the people that are more likely to be refused . 
  vwp can be changed . 
  joining the eu has been hugely beneficial . 
  fuck the us , why do we still need visas to visit ? 
  it 's 2012 , 8 years since joining the eu and still we need visas . 
  from the eu members only poland , bulgaria , and romania require visas .
