  in that case i do n't know what our government translators were smoking . 
  in pl it says  wytwarzanie i zaopatrywanie w energi\u0119 elektryczn\u0105 , gaz , par\u0119 wodn\u0105 i gor\u0105c\u0105 wod\u0119 the official translation is as you gave  electricity , gas , steam and air conditioning supply whereas the actual translation should be closer to  production and supply of electricity , gas , steam and hot water, 
  i see romney taking more dramatic policies towards iran , and other `` problem '' areas that may popup in the next 4 years , which may increase european nato commitments . 
  we get our water sent through pipes in steam form , makes for faster cooking - using less gas , saving us some money . 
  / s i have no idea how k43r got steam when i assume he meant water . 
  the polish word for steam is `` para '' and for water it is `` woda '' so that does n't explain it either . 
  or maybe they were going for `` heat '' since that usually goes with ac . 
  relax , twas a joke  one of my american friends and i did [ this ] ( http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world ) quiz from sporcle and got up to 163/196 in the 15 minutes and would have gotten more if not for misspelling some of the weird ones . 
  djibouti comes to mind . 
  i have n't heard of geosense looks fun , more difficult to place cities that are not capitals on the map . 
  i was thinking more of an option of `` i have x amount of money where can i go from wherever i am . '', 
  one suggestion , although it may be a bit difficult would be a `` anywhere '' option as the destination that shows prices to all possible destinations . 
  obviously , americans suck at geography . 
  the students are about to take their last final exam of the year and decided to show a little patriotism and have some fun , they were asking the professor to forgo the exam and instead pass them all . 
  just a little fun in a typically very serious environment . 
  poland is cohosting the uefa european championship with ukraine . 
  it starts this friday . 
  this was a week ago in pozna\u0144 before the last final exam . 
  they are changed the lyrics of the [ hymn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0hbnoau5s ) to ask the professor to pass them . 
  go for it !, 
  although i might not answer for a few days, 
  i 've done a similar trip except using trains , mapped out where i wanted to go and had everything written down , wound up just winging it after a little bit . 
  [ blogspam ] ( http://wherethefuckistom.blogspot.com ), 
  9/12 and i did n't cheat !, 
   and the soviets , though for other reasons and with a different ideology , acted very similar in their part of occupied poland during 1939-1941 and for long after the war ended, 
  not for poles :( 75 minutes filling out the ds-160 , consulate visit , chance of interview , waiting for a visa , 10 finger prints , and i do n't even know what else ; chance of tsa random selection vs. 
  flying to canada , 30 second chat with the immigration officer while they look at the passport and ask standard questions ( purpose of visit , length , where are you staying ) maybe a drug swab on the luggage . 
  problem . 
  right . 
  every country has its positives and negatives , but for me the negatives outweigh the positives as far as visiting the states goes ( 100 % i 'd rather fly to the uk over the us ) . 
  i actually flew to canada this january and had us friends come up to montreal because i did n't want to deal with the american bureaucracy and tsa . 
  i am planning to fly to the states over the summer . 
   no one shall be subjected to ** arbitrary ** interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation . 
  everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks . 
  it is not `` arbitrary interference with his privacy '' because it is very specific , they want specific information for specific people . 
   everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief , and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance . 
  these rights are n't being violated . 
  you can practice whatever religion you want , the airlines will get a hint if you request a specific meal ( no pork , beef , or vegetarian may hint towards a religion but it does not disclose it . 
  also , i do n't think any airlines log which passenger picked which meal ) there may be other laws that this violates but it does not violate the udhr . 
  it is not completely unreasonable for the us to want information on people flying to the us , that information should be limited to just the basics , information that is on your passport , if they want intra-eu flight data , or eu-not us flight data then they can fuck off . 
  i do n't like them getting credit card numbers , or seat number , or any information other than what is on my passport , which if you 're flying to the us , they 'll get anyway . 
  just another reason not to fly to the states . 
   i was just wondering how many ** europeans ** would be for a federal europe ? 
   not i , and mainly because i consider myself british , and not ** european ** . 
  i guess the question does n't apply to you then . 
  try cross posting to [ / r/poland ] ( / r/poland ), 
  http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world me and a friend got up to 160 once . 
  could n't type/spell a lot of the obscure ones . 
  at least i know how to spell djibouti now . 
  obama is black , racism is rampant among the voting older generation and is slowly waning in the youth . 
  hahahahahahaha ... hold on hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha the `` investigation '' will find that putin got too few votes . 
  north ** atlantic ** treaty organization has 26 european members and 2 non-european members euro ** atlantic ** partnership council has members like tajikistan which are not european states we 're arguing semantics here , with my position being that nato , eapc are not `` european '' organizations because they include members which are not european states . 
  both are not strictly european unions , councils , zones or ect . 
  this is true , bulgaria had to have an economic policy that promoted fdi . 
  what i 'm saying is that it was due to the fdi that your economy took off , more so than the other measures that your government put in place . 
  there is no real way to define what country is doing the `` best '' . 
  if you look at gdp - expenditure [ here ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=350 ) for q2 of 2011 , you may be surprised . 
  estonia followed by ireland followed by poland . 
  of course this is just one metric and [ estonia has a gdp roughly 24.5 x smaller than sweden and roughly 25x smaller than poland . 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:swe&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gdp+of+sweden#ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:swe:pol:est&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en ) ( estonia 's gdp growth rate rose from -14 % ( 2009 ) to 1.8 % ( 2010 ) ) if you look at the [ 2010 a.t. kearney fdi confidence index ] ( http://www.atkearney.com/index.php/publications/foreign-direct-investment-confidence-index.html ) you 'll see that germany is in fifth place worldwide , with poland in sixth . 
  france is 13th , romania 16th , and the czech republic in 17th . 
  [ pdf link ] ( http://www.atkearney.com/images/global/pdf/investing_in_a_rebound-fdici_2010.pdf ) ( some interesting reading ) poland also ( sorry a little bias here ) was the only eu country in 2009 with [ positive gdp growth ] ( http://www.wbj.pl/article-55911-can-poland-remain-a-green-island.html ) and even now with the eurozone crisis ( we are n't a member of the eurozone , but it affects all of the eu ) we still have decent growth ( although i expect it to decrease a bit ) . 
  we also may have the largest source of [ shale gas in europe ] ( http://www.gasstrategies.com/files/files/euro%20shale%20gas_final.pdf ) ( pdf link - page 3 ) and if france does n't stifle us with [ eu bureaucracy ] ( http://euobserver.com/7/114338 ) ( fracking may be harmful to the environment ) we may have a very strong economy in the next few years . 
  overall , i say poland is in a good position economically and will be in an even better position in a few years . 
  sweden should be fine economically ( unless the 2008 crisis repeats sometime soon , but even then you 'll be in a better position than others ) with your high gdp growth rate . 
  ( 5.5 % in 2010 , over 7 % now ) also , i 'm just an international relations student , and i ~ ~ hate ~ ~ dislike economics . 
  more of a foreign policy kind of guy . 
  sorry my reply took a while . 
  do n't know why you 're being downvoted as well . 
  nope , the map is debt as a percentage of gdp . 
  bulgaria had rapid gdp growth up until '08 when gdp growth nosedived . 
  basically , their gdp grew so much that they paid off most of their debt and now that the gdp growth is close to zero ( .2 % ) the debt will increase again . 
  also , their growth was mainly due to foreign direct investment and not the economic policy of bulgaria . 
  neither are the uk , poland , denmark , czech republic , lithuania , hungary , romania , and bulgaria . 
  this map is mislabeled . 
  by that metric estonia should be viewed as a safe bet because it has outperformed germany in all but one of the eight quarters . 
  germany is a safer bet than other eurozone countries because of the sheer size of their economy . 
  if germany fails , the eurozone is guaranteed to fail . 
  movie - [ katy\u0144 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm1zyq_zffm ) song - [ czes\u0142aw niemen - pod papugami ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh0p_0xolpu ), 
  that would be most welcome , although i would be curious as to what sanctions the ecj could impose . 
  eu funds for development , education , ect . . would be just about the only things that i could see being cut . 
  sure , we are `` required '' to join the eurozone once we meet certain criteria . 
  guess who controls the progress of meeting those criteria ? 
  the way i see it , we can holdout indefinitely . 
  why would a country voluntarily give up some of its sovereignty for no gain ? 
  britain will not give up control of its economic policy just because everyone else is using the euro . 
  i like the [ 1 $ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mixll.jpg ) greek coin, 
  do n't forget about the living expenses switzerland is a fucking expensive place to live . 
  as is europe in general . 
  there is no right solution for the eurozone . 
  what 's good for germany is bad for greece , spain , ireland , while whats good for those countries is bad germany , and france , and a some sort of compromise will hurt the economies of everyone . 
  you just call it congress edit : did n't you just have that whole debt ceiling fiasco ? 
  i think fnordicus thought you were being sarcastic . 
  ja klar - * yea , sure *, 
  yes , and one day we 'll take it all back . 
  * starts schemeing evil schemes *, 
  living in bia\u0142ystok , i do n't think our border is that bad . 
  i hope we ( pl ) drag our feet as much as we can before we are required to join . 
  i was drunk and needed sleep . 
   thanks .
