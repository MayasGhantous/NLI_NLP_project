warsaw is n't ** terrible ** : it 's the capital and there are 1.5 million people living there , so if you go you will find * something * for sure . 
  my point is that warsaw feels a bit like a generic city , and there are many others in poland that are much more unique and `` charming '' . 
  not op , but also finnish for me . 
  it 's super melodic and very unlike any other language in the world ( eesti gon na be mad ! ) . 
  ps : username relevant , 
   wake up , sheeple !, 
  [ oh no , you did n't !, 
   it 's not a conspiracy if it 's true . 
  wrong :p  ** conspiracy ** :  - the act of two or more persons , called conspirators , working secretly to obtain some goal , usually understood with negative connotations . 
   - ( law ) an agreement between two or more persons to break the law at some time in the future . 
   - a group of ravens . 
   - ( linguistics ) a situation in which different phonological or grammatical rules lead to similar or related outcomes . 
  it 's tricky to explain ... 
  i guess `` ooooj '' : so a double-long , ascending ` oo ' and then j as in `` jeans '' . 
  in europe , you fuck them all , in soviet russia however ... 
  munich is still reasonable ( compared to salary , at least ) , you 'd pay ~ 700 $ for a 1 bedroom apt . 
  [ and russian foreign exchange reserves are quite low ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/eng/hd_base/?prtid=mrrf_m ), 
  everyone is crazy about krak\u00f3w ( understandably so ) and warsaw ( why !? 
  special mention for the german disco-porno . 
  oh , delicious and dirt-cheap * sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr * ... 
  enjoy : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fihh0/spains_new_draconian_gag_law_in_force_man_fined/, 
  yep , and a few more , those are only the ones i remember from the top of my head . 
   and words like `` alm\u00f3ndigas '' and `` crocodilo '' , ** albeit incorrect ** , are fairly widely used . 
  not anymore , thanks to the rae . 
  maybe it 's regional ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_joke#united_states, 
  pay denbts !, 
  in theory it would be possible to have unlimited flags but i do n't know how reddit 's css is organized to support it ... 
  anyway my point is that if we set an arbitrary limit , one is good enough , since we can edit the flair text for further details and we have the eu flag for `` many nationalities '' if someone wants . 
  have a g\u00fcisqui then ... 
  czechs cheat , they have [ syllabic consonants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syllabic_consonant ) ... 
  that 's not even the best one in polish . 
  it has two consonant sounds , 2 vowels and 3 consonant sounds . 
  `` be ** zwzgl ** \u0119dny '' , on the other hand ... 
  ok , so why not three flags ? 
  with two flags i would still need to leave one flag out , i would like three flags very much . 
  and i 'm sure the next guy will have use for four flags ... 
  no escargots ? 
  are you on strike ? 
  my two favorite finnish soundalikes : - kasa puuta : `` pile of wood '' ( fi ) / ~ whorehouse ( es ) - katso merta : `` look at the sea '' ( fi ) / ~ dick shit ( it ), 
   the rae normally does a great work toballa , cederr\u00f3n , alm\u00f3ndigas , bluy\u00edn , murci\u00e9galo , as\u00edn , crocodilo ... 
  imo it 's because portuguese people `` do n't open their mouth '' while speaking . 
  it 's hard to explain . 
  for instance , portuguese read the letter o with a sound the really resembles the letter u. 
  in the end the whole speech comes out a bit like a frequency-shifted mumbling . 
  * lazarillo de tormes * is pretty interesting , out of the classical ones . 
  you spelled ` koskenkorva ' wrong , 
  m\u00e4mmi is delicious !, 
  too bad you can not find it anywhere outside of finland, 
   and believe me that i do n't ** understan ** shit . 
  \u00a1 filthy casuals !, 
  i 'm sorry , i thought this is reddit , the place to be pedantic and make bad jokes ? 
  technically , they 're not * human * . 
  ~ ~ amen ! ~ ~ i mean ... 
  i agree . 
  the 3600th has one f16 upside down . 
  but ... but ... the lady of the lake ... 
  the teller spoke english ? 
  it 's the ` muricans ( * polack * jokes ), 
  shots fired !, 
  ^ ^ at ^ ^ least , ^ ^ drawing ^ ^ of ^ ^ shots ... 
  they might still have some marble they managed to hide the first time around ... 
  i always thought the only way to stop a bad guy with a drawing of a pistol is a good guy with a drawing of a pistol ... 
   i 've asked already what 's so `` hateful '' in this example of `` discrimination '' . 
  thank you !, 
  this is exactly what i wanted to read . 
   start quoting or stop bothering me . 
  sure ...  why just two and why adults ? 
  that is priceless . 
  never gets old !, 
  besides , you never quoted anything . 
  start quoting or stop bothering me . 
   so where are these proofs ? 
  so far you was unable to proove any of these ridiculous accusations . 
  start here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fzkkw/polands_conservative_president_andrzej_duda_takes work your way down . 
   as bad as to disagree with lefty newspeak ??? 
   i guess it should be penalised as well . 
  please improve your posts . 
  this one was confusing , not entertaining . 
  charge your battery !, 
   again , no answer says about the answer ...  just more sarcasm and accusations well-founded , link proven accusations . 
  sure . 
  and i have more where * those * came from !, 
   this time comparation of my opinions to rape and murder oh , so you do realize that rape and murder are bad ? 
  phew , that 's a relief ...  are you nuts ? 
  i know that equality sounds nuts to you , that 's the whole point . 
    why just two and why adults ? 
   and what 's so hateful in that example of `` discrimination '' ? 
  oh - my - god , this is sooo good . 
  saved !, 
   the funny thing is that you 're throwing accusations and ca n't provide anything to back them up . 
  yeah ... except this whole thread . 
   you 're a fanatic becouse you ca n't tolerate another point of view . 
  i 'm also against murder and rape . 
  ca n't tolerate them . 
  what a fanatic i am !, 
  send help !, 
   even this ridiculously partanoid sarcasm sounds like another accusation . 
  huh ? 
   p.s. 
  try more sock puppets .
