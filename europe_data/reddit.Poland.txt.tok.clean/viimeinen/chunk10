  does n't mean that you can tailgate a driver and stop him every 100m for a breathalyzer test , but you do n't solve that banning breathalyzers . 
  is it because uk 's economy is heavy on the banking/finance sector ? 
  it 's still not mass surveillance , it 's the investigation of a crime so i am not against it ( as long as it 's judge-authorized ) . 
  i 'm not saying `` i have nothing to hide '' , i 'm saying `` i 'm ok if the police investigate those who have committed a crime '' . 
   they are rewarded [ 1 ] . 
  you simply do n't know much about this issue . 
  you completely ignored the main point i made instead writing a long silly post that is a waste of everyone 's time . 
  cool story bro . 
  we are talking about finland . 
   where did i say that the alternative system is that people should be let off scott free ? 
  when you defended the flat-fine model . 
  if people can just pay for driving 70km/h on a 60km/h , they will ( and they do ) . 
   in the context of the argument here , traffic lights or cameras are part of the same idea - traffic laws designed for profit rather than safety . 
  so it 's relevant . 
  no it 's not * traffic lights or cameras * . 
  you claimed that '' [ we still have ** traffic lights ** despite their ** proven ineffectiveness ** in ** terms of safety ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eregj/snoop_dogg_accuses_sweden_of_racial_profiling_as/ctix1h9 ) '' . 
  click the link . 
  read your words . 
  do n't weasel out of them . 
  you said that it 's proven that traffic lights are proven to be ineffective safety-wise . 
  that is beyond moronic , and of course totally false . 
   how is that remotely relevant ? 
  you apparently consider us to be a non-valid example , yet provide a ( hilariously counterproductive ) example from the us . 
  that 's how it 's relevant . 
   i did n't at all claim it should be legal to jump a red light let me quote your words again : '' [ we still have ** traffic lights ** despite their ** proven ineffectiveness ** in ** terms of safety ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eregj/snoop_dogg_accuses_sweden_of_racial_profiling_as/ctix1h9 ) '' . 
   it is proven . 
  [ 2 ] regardless , the article showed that the idea that they do not increase safety is well known which was enough for my point in the argument here to be reasonable . 
  not at all bullshit as you claimed . 
  yeah , i 'm not gon na watch a 15 minute video when the previous article you linked completely contradicted your own point . 
  the article * absolutely * did * not * show that . 
  the article showed that some people * claim * that . 
  which is immensely different . 
  read it again and quote where specifically the article claims those facts . 
   that makes no sense whatsoever . 
  thank you !, 
  i does not make sense indeed !, 
  i do n't know why you suggested it then ...  how do you know how he thinks about money ? 
  $ 100k could mean more to him than $ 100k means to you . 
  if i lost $ 100k i 'd be homeless living on soup kitchens . 
  i he lost $ 100k he would n't even notice the change in his wealth . 
  he 'd lose the 0.000125 % of his fortune . 
  yep , i 'm going to go ahead and say $ 100k means more to me than him . 
   most drivers get fined a few times in their lifetime , even with full intention of staying within the law . 
  so why should poor drivers be punished proportionately more ? 
  they have full intention of staying within the law !, 
   you ca n't seem to wrap your head around how minor traffic violations can be . 
  i 've been driving for a while , and i have gotten a parking ticket . 
  fully 100 % my fault . 
  deserved to be punished , paid the 30 $ . 
  which for me was 10 % of my monthly income at the time . 
  how is that fair ? 
   they 're not all travelling 120 miles per hour outside a school . 
  for that you go to jail in any country for beaking at least 3 different public safety laws . 
  we are talking about fines and tickets , like doing 140km/h on a 120 or parking like a douchebag . 
   here 's one from this very day [ 3 ] that is absurdly unfair . 
  which is why you can contest any ticket and those unfair are thrown out . 
   bill gates would most likely get fined a few times over a lifetime just like everyone else . 
  so why should everyone else be punished more ? 
  why should i be punished with 2 days of salary and he gets 2 seconds ? 
  if we got community service we would both lose 1 day . 
  how come he gets 1 second when it comes to financial penalty ? 
   the point was that police can see you are rich , and fine you multiple times . 
  same applies to when you 're poor . 
  being rich changes nothing . 
   the law allows police to pretty much call anything a violation and give a fine for it . 
  anything that breaks the law , yes . 
   there 's no way for the tax man to take advantage of you like that for their own benefit . 
  because you can not avoid taxes . 
  you can get 0 fines if you follow the law . 
  i 'm not motivated enough to look up the all urls again , but one example is : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3175176/snoop-dogg-taken-police-sweden-pulled-suspicion-driving-influence-calls-incident-racial-profiling.html  under suspicion of driving under the influence , 2 \\ . 
  i do n't think you understand mass surveillance . 
  it has nothing to do with police inspecting your phone or computer when you are under investigation , it means recording all your communications all the time . 
  i do n't see the relation . 
  look at my phone for drugs ? 
  i do n't see how i could store drugs in my phone , so it 's irrelevant for the investigation . 
  if they suspected i was trafficking , then sure . 
  demanding a urine sample ? 
  if i 'm making a mess acting all hyper/high/drunk , i think it 's fair . 
  it 's unfortunately true that some people are racist and homophobes . 
  the worst thing is that they are loud about it and the rest of the people think it 's something harmless/tolerable :(, 
  literally every other source i could find . 
  guardian , independent , daily mirror ( seems only british papers reported on this ) . 
  bbc does not say anything one way or the other . 
  nothing in the spanish , polish or german media . 
  the difference is you can not `` diagnose '' child porn possession by external behavior . 
  you can with drug use , and that is the key difference . 
  if i were in the park , taking pictures of ( fully clothed ) children 's bottoms , i would not be surprised to be suspect of investigations and having my computer searched . 
  that sucks . 
  sounds like in immediate need of a change ... 
  well , true , * they * did n't go full nazi . 
  just their iron ore did , 
  swedish authorities tell tmz ? 
  sure , swedish authorities talk all the time to freakin tmz , while ignoring any other media outlet !, 
  i think i 'll pass on that and keep a healthy dose of scepticism . 
  i 'll wait for the official version of a spokesperson . 
  if you speak swedish , is n't there anything in the swedish news that would clarify this ? 
  the laws do n't * allow * profiling , it 's just up to the specific policeman . 
  same as with arabic-looking people being stopped . 
  if drug tests are allowed by law , everyone is susceptible of being tested . 
  naturally `` known criminals '' ( in this case , people who are known to use drugs ) are suspected more often than small children and old ladies , so they are tested more often .
