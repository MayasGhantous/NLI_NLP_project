  that is moronic on his part . 
  i 'd file a complaint against that guy ( if you can do such things in sweden , i know it 's extremely difficult in spain , for instance ) . 
  the argument was against profiling . 
  and i said that i have been profiled before . 
  as i also said , i have never lived in a country where drug use is illegal , so the consequences of the detention are different . 
   police should not be rewarded for punishing a larger amount of people . 
  this encourages corruption . 
  they are n't . 
  policemen do n't work on commission . 
  it would n't encourage corruption , as long as you require proof for each case . 
  most tickets are given by automated systems . 
  cameras do n't get an extra dose of lens cleaner for * being a good boy * . 
   of course , but rewarding them for punishing people is well known to lead to injustice . 
  again : they are not rewarded , it 's their freakin ' job . 
   the government will also change the laws to maximise the fines they get . 
  on the contrary . 
  most radar speed checks are in known trouble spots and they are public lists of the locations . 
  and on top of that you get traffic signs well in advance announcing their presence . 
  if you are caught speeding you are a damn moron and you deserve to be fined . 
   there are some unsafe roads , that generate millions for the government , and do not get redesigned for public safety because they are too profitable . 
  * and the govenment will come and shit in your fridge and rape your dog . 
  * we can all make bullshit apocalyptic scenarios . 
  you are describing manslaughter : causing the death of a person by negligence . 
  i ca n't imagine this happening anywhere in the modern civilized world and if it happens they deserve to rot in jail . 
   this is why ** we still have traffic lights despite their proven ineffectiveness in terms of safety ** , because making it illegal to jump a red light is a very convenient way to generate revenue . 
  before i overreact : are you * seriously * claiming that ** it should be legal to jump a red light ** ? 
  * really * ? 
  the article you link talks about the effectiveness of ** cameras ** , not about effectiveness of ** traffic lights ** . 
  the article you link absolutely does not ** prove ** that they are ineffective , either : * but whether the cameras made florida 's roads safer -- or just swelled state and city coffers -- is an * *** open question *** ( second sentence of the article ) . 
  and it provides no data to even doubt the effectiveness , just that some anti-camera lobbists claim they are installed for money , not safety . 
  even ** they ** do n't claim they are ineffective . 
  to sum up : bull-shit . 
   what has the us to do with anything ? 
  says the guy linking usa-today . 
   if shops started charging 0.01 % of your yearly income for a loaf of bread , perfect . 
  this is exactly my point . 
  you hit it in the head . 
  apparently endangering the lives of other people by breaking the law is the same as buying bread . 
  this is ** exactly ** the attitude i was talking about . 
  * i * *** deserve *** * to drive 150km/h because i pay for it * . 
  ** you do n't have the right to endanger my life because you are rich . 
  fuck you and anyone that thinks like you . 
   money does not change its value depending on how much you have . 
  you are not paying for any ** value ** , you are being ** punished ** for breaking the law . 
  and the punishment must hurt you so you do n't repeat it . 
  if bill gates is fined $ 100.000 he wo n't even notice it in this check book and it will in no way change his behavior . 
  if i am fined 1.000 $ it will ruin my whole month and i will very much remember it for the future . 
  a year in jail ( or a slap on the wrist ) hurts us both the same , a fine should too . 
   police will see a rich car , spot some minor violation , and see a huge payday . 
  you * really * think police work on commission , do you ? 
  do they in your country ? 
  you seem obsessed with the idea the policeman gets to keep the money . 
  he does n't even get to * see * the money , he writes you a citation and a judge decides how much you pay . 
  most of the time there is n't even a policeman do begin with , it 's a camera that catches you . 
   rich people can also just hire a poor person to drive them around , and get cheap fines they could , but the poor person is free to drive within the limits . 
  if the rich person * forces * them to break the law , that is a crime and you can battle that in court , and get a very nice settlement if they fire you over it . 
   so the system is in a way denying rich people the right to drive their own vehicle . 
  bull-shit . 
  it 's a way of denying rich people the right to ~ ~ drive ~ ~ ** break the law ** driving their own vehicle . 
  you can drive all you want . 
  just do n't break the fucking law . 
  and if you do , expect to be punished in a way that it hurts you as much as it hurts anyone else . 
   there is no element of corruption if you dislike corruption ( like most people ) fight corruption , not a fair fine system . 
   taxed multiple times just because ~ ~ you 're rich ~ ~ ** you break the law multiple times ** . 
  ftfy, 
  nope . 
  `` snoop dog : i was arrested in sweden for driving while black '' . 
  `` snoop dogg arrested in sweden over ` suspicion of driving under the influence ' '' . 
  the police can always say that or anything else . 
  in most countries they can arrest anyone for any reason for a limited amount of time . 
  if a policeman wants to harass you , he can . 
  under what circumstances did it happen ? 
  ( curious ) 4 . 
  i have n't lived in a country where drug * use * is illegal , so it has n't happened to me , no . 
  but i have been stopped because my car looked suspicious ( used to drive a `` tuned '' car ) . 
  i give them my documentation , they check it . 
  i politely answer any questions and i continue on my way . 
  i do n't see the drama . 
  i googled it . 
  no mentions of being the passenger . 
  if you have n't experienced it 's maybe because no one in the car was acting in a way that would arise suspicion . 
  i have n't seen anyone interrogated for murder either , then again , i have n't been in a car with people covered in blood . 
  this is not an argument to stop people covered in blood from being interrogated . 
  are you sure * frisk * is the the word you want to use ? 
  i have seen many interactions with nordic police and they seem * extremely * reluctant to touch you . 
  what i ( or the police ) assume about his use is irrelevant . 
  that 's why he was taken to a test and not to jail/fined . 
   all the sources claim he was the passenger . 
  i have n't seen one . 
  i have asked in this thread 4 times already , no one has provided one . 
   but that is were the discussion about profiling begin . 
  how ? 
  it is very common to have heavy police presence at the exit of concerts and nightlife-areas , to the point of stopping * every * car . 
  so i ca n't see any profiling there . 
  once they stopped the car , if he was driving they can test him for any substance , period . 
  now , if he was the passenger , then it depends on the situation . 
  he can say it was profiling , the policeman can say he had a suspicion of illegal activity . 
  it all depends on how `` visibly covered in blood '' he was . 
  i guess we 'll know after the results of the test . 
  there 's option 3 : they were stopping random cars at the exit of a snoop dogg concert and they happened to stop him .
