  afaik he was driving , all news i 've read write about a dui , or whining about `` driving while black '' . 
  once they stop you , if they suspect you of breaking the law ( which apparently * smoking weed * is , in sweden ) , they can investigate you . 
  if the passenger of a car stopped was covered in blood they would investigate further , suspecting murder . 
  if smoking weed is illegal and during a lawful stop they observed behavior indicative of having smoked weed , they investigated further , suspecting drug use . 
  being a passenger does not give you the right of breaking the law . 
  you surely know that the test is not a binary yes/no result but gives the concentration of thc , which can indicate how recent/how intense the intoxication is . 
   are n't there several countries in europe where road fines are based on percentage of income ? 
  so bill gates would get fined millions for a traffic violation , and so far some people have been fined hundreds of thousands . 
  in finland , afaik . 
   people here seemed to be strongly in favour of that absurd system . 
  yes , because a traffic ticket is supposed to discourage you from doing illegal and dangerous stuff . 
  just because you 're rich , should n't mean you are basically allowed to go speeding in a school zone , since `` you can afford the ticket , 600 $ for you is nothing '' . 
   i do n't think it should be legal to fine people for traffic offences like that because it 's a form of corruption that encourages overpolicing to get more money for the state . 
  * corruption * , i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  a police officer stopping speeding car to collect money for the state is called * doing his job * . 
  if he stops a guy , sues his house for enabling him speeding and lives there rent free for a year , that is * corruption * . 
  most tickets are automated and given by cameras ( speeding , running a red light , etc ) these days anyway . 
   i guess most commenters here do n't mind persecution of the rich since they 're not rich themselves . 
  it 's in no way a prosecution of the rich . 
  it 's about an effective ticket system that will discourage all people equally from doing dangerous/illegal/annoying shit . 
  i guess in the us rich people are used to have preferential treatment even in the legal system . 
  eliminating privileges is not prosecution . 
  it 's enforcing `` equality under the law '' . 
   the law should instead give penalty points/take their license taken away , make them do community service or serve jail time . 
  they do that too , for the reallly serious offences ( dui , exceeding the maximum speed in 50 % , etc ) . 
  you * must * be smart enough to know that `` road-side '' refers to the circumstances of the stop , not where the specific sample is taken ... 
  also healthcare is mostly free , workers have rights and broomsticks are guns . 
  and pizza is not a vegetable . 
   not only i forgot what is the english name , i also spelled the german version wrong ... :-) it 's not dunav in german either , it 's donau  ( danube in english ), 
  i have only seen those in ( old ) movies . 
  i was referring to breathalyzer or urine/blood/hair analysis ( hence the generic word `` tests '' ) . 
   snoop was a passenger , not a driver . 
  source ? 
   do sweden and poland have anything in common ? 
  driving laws are pretty much standard , very minor differences . 
   yes , for drunk driving what about driving under the influence of marijuana ? 
  yep . 
  also , we can tell him right now : do n't go to indonesia . 
  exactly . 
  but according to all news reports , he was driving . 
   i always assumed countries like sweden were less strict when it came to things like weed . 
  nordic countries are way more progressive than the u.s. on pretty much every other social issue . 
  i could see how someone like snoop dogg would assume he would n't be in any danger having smoked weed recently . 
  for someone who probably travels internationally a lot you 'd think he 'd do a little research on the countries he 's visiting just to be in the clear for something like this . 
  they have the strange obsession of not letting people drive while drunk or high . 
  bastards . 
   mention weed and he 'll go full nazi . 
  nope , i think you have to offer him deutsche marks for his iron for that . 
  everywhere i read said he was charged with a dui . 
  so i understand he was the driver . 
  drunk test = breathalyzer, 
  / thread, 
   for the record , i do think marihuana should be legalized , but that 's beyond this discussion . 
  sure , but surely not while driving ? 
   he was n't driving . 
  source ? 
   while in sweden they will physically force you to give a urine sample if you refuse to ? 
  if it 's like most other countries they wo n't force you . 
  it 's just that there is a penalty for refusing ( usually the same as testing positive : ticket , license revocation , optionally jail ) . 
  this was a traffic stop , not `` an investigation '' . 
  police can do it for no reason . 
  they are n't necessarily allowed to search your car , but they can check your license , insurance , car 's papers and submit you to a breathalizer/drug test . 
    but people ca n't be pulled over for no reason , can they ? 
   well , no ... false . 
  police ** can ** stop you for an alcohol/drug test , no reason needed . 
  random or not . 
  and in most countries you ca n't refuse ( refusing carries the same penalties as a positive ) . 
   by signing that search warrant what search warrant ? 
  it was a road-side alcohol/drug test , the same thousands of drivers go through every single day . 
  we eurocommies allow the police to stop drivers and submit them to tests to make sure they are not high/drunk while operating that 2 tons of metal on public roads . 
  how dare we !, 
   snatched him out of his car he was driving . 
  you absolutely can select a driver for an alcohol/drugs test . 
  we eurocommies allow the police to stop drivers and submit them to tests to make sure they are not high/drunk while operating that 2 tons of metal on public roads . 
  how dare we !, 
  there is no civil forfeiture anywhere in europe , afaik . 
  here you can only sue people , not things . 
  we leave that to the land of freedom ( tm ) , 
   i think i need to go and hang myself . 
  no need , just buy the new and improved , more legendary , more glorious ... * german * mini !, 
   vw has n't been very humble for quite a while . 
  it 's been a mid-range manufacturer since the early 90s at least . 
  humble in comparison to bmw and audi . 
  so '' * humble * '' , not `` humble '' , 
  well , if it 's the 2015 report it must be for 2014 data , so 2-3 year olds are actually 2011-2012 ... edit , for the downvoting geniuses : the `` t\u00dcv 2015 report '' came early november 2014 . 
  oh , come on , you have the legend , the glorious mini ... ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  yet luxembourg and liechtenstein drive humble vw ... 
  no , the subway system is made by siemens , 
  those who did n't drive [ porsches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elefant ), 
   have they tested logan 2 ? 
  because in the pdf it 's the first version , from 10 years ago . 
  it 's for 2-3 year old cars ( so 2013-2012 model ) . 
   the biggest difference is high unemployment in eastern slovakia pls invest in eastern ~ ~ poland ~ ~ slovakia !, 
   why should i bother trying somewhere else to fit in with all the different shit ? 
  try all the shit !, 
   they act like an asshole to you when they find out you 're polish :( i only have seen this in nachod , right on the border . 
  in prague everyone seems to be friendly . 
  shots fired !, 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( we ^ ^ ^ * are * ^ ^ ^ talking ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ulster ^ ^ ^ are n't ^ ^ ^ we ? ), 
   a prostitute that claims to have the biggest dick ?
