  [ russia gladly joins ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/europe/russian-town-near-ukraine-once-quiet-now-buzzes-with-military-activity.html )  there have even been reports of rocket-propelled grenades fired in bars .

   poland is the only sober one . 
  and why should n't he be ? 
  he 's in the pub toilet , cleaning it . 
  yeah ... those two are not mutually exclusive , you know ... 
  # \u00bf \u00a1 , \u00a1 ^ here , you dropped these . 
  do n't let latvia know about that !,

  they patted him on the back in support and told him they do n't have any cash on them tight now . 
   in france it at least seems like when the population gets angry it 's a car or some fish to protest the economic policies of their government . 
  seems like a better attitude to me . 
  it seems like a very sad way to look at things . 
  `` at least they did n't kill anyone ... '', 
  did we ever stop ? 
   they burn ~ ~ british ~ ~ ** french ** fish , they light manure on fire in front of super markets , they open up the taps of belgian milk transporters ... and they get away with it . 
  ftfy, 
  so , let 's all rejoice because nobody is worse than hitler ? 
  that 's pessimistic ... 
   the guys responsible for this are a ** tiny majority ** . 
  wait ... what ? 
  / r/civ is leaking !, 
  two key points in the article that nobody seems to care about ( it would not allow to hate ` the other side ' )  greece claims 10 miles of air space around the islands , while turkey recognizes only six miles and argues that its fighters are flying in international air space . 
  [ ... ] ** many of the incidents take place within the contentious four-mile radius ** near the turkish coast , which athens considers its territory and ankara calls international airspace . 
  and about the money ...  greece 's disastrous finances may , however , have encouraged turkey to tease its long-time foe ( and nato ally ) a bit more than usual , as every hellenic air force scramble costs greece precious euros . 
  `` in the case of air incursions , you have to react , '' said dokos . 
  [ ... ]  `` it 's very hard to unilaterally pull back from a situation of military aggression . 
  it 's a tragic situation , because the money we 're spending on dogfights with turkey is money that we ** could have spent on other areas of defense ** . '' does n't seem like they were going to spend the money on pensions anyway ... 
  polan stonk, 
  source about die linke and iu ? 
  not again ... 
  well , that 's your opinion and it 's ok . 
  i do n't agree and we probably wo n't convince each other . 
  my point was against making up arguments , not against one argument in particular , 
  ianal but it seems pretty specific about totalitarian systems . 
  as long as your group/party defends a democratic ( real democratic , not `` people 's repubilc democratic '' ) system , it should be fine . 
  it does however explicitly ban fascist/communist symbolism , so your logo can not have a swastika or a hammer and sickle . 
  this one is specific about political parties/organizations tho , not the more general `` glorifying communism/fascism '' ( like the russians did in warsaw in 2012 ) . 
  mainland europe does n't have borders . 
  literally , you are driving on the road and just see a traffic sign `` welcome in germany '' and that 's it . 
  no id , no passport , no checks at all ( you need to have * some * id on you in case police stop you ) . 
  true for norway as well , i do n't know about switzerland . 
  for uk there is a check , a national id card is enough . 
  source : travelled a lot . 
  what is forbidden ( [ law linked in this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eg4c1/ukraine_bars_communist_party_from_elections/ctf272m ) ) is `` defense of a fascist , communist or other totalitarian state model '' . 
  so the totalitarianism aspect is forbidden , not the idea of socialism . 
  sigh , here we go . 
  / u/vortalwombat claimed :  banning parties is not european and not democratic . 
  there are communists and nazis in this world to which / u/slusny _ cizinec replied :  tell this to non-democratic us , non-democratic germany and many other non-democratic countries . 
  the argument being `` by that definition , germany and us are non-democratic because they have banned ** some ** parties . '', 
  you the come up with :  usa has a communist party . 
  germany has a communist party . 
  uk has a communist party . 
  [ ... ] i want to show '' ** they banned them all ** '' is wrong , i only need to find one that was n't banned . 
  the thing is : ** no one argued germany and the us banned all parties ** , the argument was '' ** banning parties ** is not european and not democratic . '', 
  and the us and germany have indeed `` banned parties '' . 
  you added the `` all '' and then came up with an argument against your made-up claim and when i called your bullshit you downvoted me . 
  typical day on reddit . 
  saved for future reference , thanks !, 
  denmark is actively inviting people to immigrate , as far as i can tell . 
  i got this ad while browsing a spanish news site : http://it.talentattractiondenmark.com/ which made me look and find this , if someone is interested : http://www.expatindenmark.com/livingindenmark/pages/default.aspx, 
    great . 
  ** commie and nazis ** have nothing to do in a legal politics . 
   i think those has nothing to do in legal politics who wants to decide who has a place in legal politics . 
  banning parties is not european and not democratic . 
  there are ** communists and nazis ** in this world , and until they follow the rules and obey the law you have to tolerate them , because they have the same rights as you . 
  i think you 're missing something in your answer ...  usa has a ** communist ** party . 
  germany has a ** communist ** party . 
  uk has a ** communist ** party . 
    come on they never got more than 6 % during last 10 years . 
  ** it 's not a bright idea to ban them ** , but they would never reach 10 % . 
   they did n't get many votes !!!!, 
  it is perfectly fine to ban them !!!, 
  i 've heard it but i never knew if it 's true . 
  which law is it ? 
   this does not imply that ukraine was there voluntarily . 
  finland or poland were part of russian empire prior to ~ ~ revolution ~ ~ ** ww1 ** too at least for poland ( became independent from russia , germany and austria ) . 
  it was stolen and it 's being laundered . 
  please stand by . 
  thanks for the effort !, 
  [ ok ... wow ] ( https://youtu.be/7zmjtyauta0?t=189 ) . 
  he seems to be in the uk tho . 
  [ it might be due to a communication problems ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  sounds like healthcare.gov on a bigger scale . 
  any plans to scrap it a start from scratch like the americans did ? 
  ... how ? 
  lol , i had to reopen it after reading your comment . 
  checks out . 
  so about that judge part ... if a husband suspects cheating , can he `` sue '' to request a judge for a dna test ? 
  [ is he ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e7u3v/poland_will_not_pay_a_penny_for_greece_poland/ctcfkcn ), 
  he said that . 
  that is a fact . 
  i do n't speak russian but on every media i checked the quotes were the same . 
  on rt.com , itar , tass and other english-spreaking russian media there was no info about this . 
  how can this be `` propaganda '' ? 
  it 's not taken out of context , he literally praised the pact with hitler that started the second world war .
