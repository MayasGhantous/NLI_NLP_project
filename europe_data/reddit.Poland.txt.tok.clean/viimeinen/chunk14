  btw : he is also annexing neighboring countries using minority populations as an excuse . 
  it 's just gerogia and ukraine instead of austria and sudetenland . 
  i wonder if he is also a failed painter ... 
  as a polish guy , i 'd be curious for your opinion . 
  how can be defending [ a pact that divided poland \\ ( and europe \\ ) in two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact#the_secret_protocol ) between hitler and stalin be something acceptable to do . 
  and we are not talking about some dude on the internet , we are talking about the head of state of one of those countries that invaded their neighbors . 
  for me it 's outrageous ... 
   i never said its ok what russia is doing . 
  you kind of did . 
  maybe not literally , but at least that was my impression . 
  about the usa : it 's a totally new and different topic , which i do n't want to discuss . 
  as i said , it 's complex and it would require a lot of time . 
  i 'm not fooled by the media , i follow a lot of what happens in russia ( everyone in poland does ) . 
  you can not say that `` the downfall of nazi germany was a catastrophe , because a lot of people lost their jobs '' . 
  that is bullshit . 
  the collapse of the ussr was a good thing for everyone except for russian politicians/oligarchs that wanted more power . 
  now , if russia lost people is because russia was forcing people to leave and settle in other parts of the soviet union . 
  it was russia 's fault . 
  see latvia and estonia for instance . 
  or [ the wik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#under_the_soviet_union ) i for more [ info ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_colonialism#soviet_era ) . 
  btw there are tons of quotes like that . 
  how about [ putin saying that the molotov-ribbentrop pact was a-ok ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11213255/vladimir-putin-says-there-was-nothing-wrong-with-soviet-unions-pact-with-adolf-hitlers-nazi-germany.html ) ? 
   so you say this government is less corrupt ? 
  i guess not . 
  are you aware that yanukovych ( the former president ) had a mansion with a [ galleon , a private zoo ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-uprising-the-private-zoo-the-galleon-moored-on-a-private-lake-the-fleet-of-vintage-cars--ukrainians-left-openmouthed-at-the-opulence-of-yanukovychs-country-estate-9146886.html ) and a [ golden toilet ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-golden-toilet-bowl-yanukovych/25069164.html ) ? 
  it 's hard to rival * that * level of corruption . 
  so yes , i say that the current government is * less * corrupt . 
   i guess not . 
  it was not about rejecting russia , that should be clear . 
  technically it was about getting closer to the eu , which russia ( or , in 1989 , the ussr ) absolutely was n't allowing , so rejecting russia/ussr was a tool to reach the goal of reaching to the free world . 
   russia was the number one trade partner of ukraine , without russia there is no ukrainian economy ( future will show ) . 
  lithuania , latvia and estonia were in the exact same situation ( they were part of the ussr ) , and they are doing quite well without russia . 
   when that eu-ukraine trade deal would have become reality , what does the ukraine produce that the eu need ? 
  - right , not much . 
  ukraine has a stong mining and energy industry , a decent machinery production , including [ spaceships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuzhnoye_design_office ) ( they were the main manufacturer of soviet aircrafts ) , and an extensive food producer . 
  what does poland produce that the eu needs ? 
  or latvia ? 
  there is always something . 
   the ukrainian market would have been flooded with tax free , cheap european goods . 
  and that is awesome for the people , that is exactly what they wanted . 
  the more competition the better . 
  modern countries are based on a service-oriented economy , not on manufacturing . 
   i think its worse to cause over half a million death people for gaining control over some oil fields in iraq , well , if you think half a million is bad what do you think about a [ million and a half killed , three million wounded and two million refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93afghan_war ) ? 
   and i think its ridiculous to not impose sanctions against the us for starting the iraq war , but to impose sanctions against russia for their actions in ukraine . 
  you might be right ( it 's a complex topic ) , but the correct action would be to sanction the usa , not to withdraw the sanctions against russia . 
   as long as we ( the europeans ) treat russia and the usa different , its just a joke . 
  not really . 
  most eu countries are in nato and therefore the us is an ally . 
  you treat allies differently than `` neutral '' countries . 
  the us has proven twice that they are willing to go to war to help their european allies , that kind of grants them a special treatment . 
  maybe it 's not morally right , but it 's the reality . 
  that 's why i said before it 's a very complex topic . 
  and in no way means that what russia is doing is ok . 
  it just excuses belarus and kazakhstan from denouncing russia ( they are russia 's allies ) . 
   our polticians can talk as long as they want , everyone notices this hypocrite bullshit what they call `` western values '' . 
  a few exceptions here and there should n't tarnish all that western values represent . 
  nobody in the west goes to jail for `` gay propaganda '' . 
  nobody in the west gets [ polonium poisoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_of_alexander_litvinenko ) for spreking against their government . 
  nobody in the west gets shot for trying to jump the berlin wall . 
  anybody in eastern europe can tell you how much you appreciate western values when you do n't have them . 
   edit : i think you should try to distinguish between udssr and ru , as you distinguished between nazi-germany and brd . 
  oh , here i strongly disagree . 
  putin has said that [ the collapse of the ussr in 1991 was `` the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-collapse-of-the-soviet-union-was-catastrophe-of-the-century-6147493.html ) . 
  can you imagine angela merkel saying that `` the downfall of nazi germany was the greatest tragedy of the century '' ? 
  and imho that is the whole point of both polish and american side . 
  we are still pissed about the 1939 debacle . 
  guys , they caught us !, 
  damn !, 
  who told them about our trip to washington asking bush to please install the shield in poland ? 
   you know that those events are totally different from the ukrainian-crisis not at all . 
  they were '' * a people 's revolution against a russian-backed corrupt government * '' . 
  countries trying as hard as they can to reject russia and get closer to the west . 
  exactly what ukraine was doing . 
  --  i guess it sounds weird as i wrote it , i meant : they will only do stuff for gaining more power , with democracy/freedom being a side effect ( sometimes the opposite of democracy and freedom ) . 
  examples : 1953 iranian coup d'\u00e9tat 1973 chilean coup d'\u00e9tat iraq war all those are bad but : 1 . 
  they are not ** annexations ** . 
  they are interventions to change the government of a country with a friendlier government , not to steal territory from another country . 
  beating a person is bad , killing them is worse . 
  russia/ussr has done them exactly the same , if not worse , during the same time . 
  all the eastern european countries in 1945-1946 ( [ poland example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people's_referendum,_1946 ) , but * every * country had similar coups ) , [ hungary in 1956 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) or in [ czechoslovakia in 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) , not to forget about the [ annexation of the baltics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  --  there was no reason for annexing territory as there was nothing valuable for the us on cuban soil . 
  and the us would have invaded cuba , but the crisis was resolved before that happened . 
  there are plenty of natural resources in cuba . 
  the us could have invaded them without a problem long before the crisis , but did n't . 
  --  im not here to apologise/reason about the russian annexation ( call it as you like ) of crimea . 
  you can not call it anything else . 
  --  i just think there were bigger warcrimes in the past , with much less outcry in the western politics/media . 
  i 'd love to hear more examples of bigger warcrimes that an illegal annexation of parts of a neighboring country . 
  --  which doesnt make it reasonable or better , but it lets me question the sanctions against russia for annexing crimea . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  the fact that some countries have made mistakes in the past does n't mean that they can not protest against wrongdoing in the present . 
  germany invading poland in 1939 does n't give poland the right to invade germany ( or an neighbor ) in 2015 . 
  basically no country on earth is blameless . 
   i think even a blind person would have seen how this regime-change was us-backed . 
  i can give you a detailed reasoning for that statement if you want . 
  and i can give you a reasoning why it was totally democratic . 
  unless one of us provides proof , we wo n't get anywhere . 
  you could also probably give a detailed reasoning why the 1989 changes in poland , hungary , cz , and east germany were us-backed . 
   governments/presidents of big powers will always do whats possible to keep or increase their influence in the world/in their `` neighborhood '' that should be pretty clear and easy to understand . 
  of course .
