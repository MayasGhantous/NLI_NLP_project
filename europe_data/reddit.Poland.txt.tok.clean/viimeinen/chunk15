   there is no other reason for some political actions than to increase their power/influence ( influence = power ) . 
  i agree . 
  they will never do stuff for freedom/democracy ( propaganda ) in the first place . 
  i can give you examples on this if you want . 
  re-read that sentence again and give me the examples if you please . 
   did the usa accept the communist government in cuba ? 
  no , i think this should be clear . 
  where they happy ? 
  have they ** invaded ** cuba and ** annexed ** the territory ? 
  hell no . 
  totally different . 
   us-backed regime-change citation needed  putin stated it a few times that he wont accept any nato influence in georgia and ukraine putin has absolutely no right to do this . 
   us wont accept any pro-russian governments in canada , mexico or ** cuba ** for example are you kidding me ? 
  have you missed the last 50 years of history ? 
  no problem , 
  the problem is , that might not be enough . 
  did n't make sense for them to attack ukraine either , and look where we are . 
  maybe poland is less vulnerable , but the baltics , with big russian minorities ( russia 's favorite excuse ) and a direct border to mainland russia , must feel a bit worried . 
  a good part of the reason is that germany has assumed its role in wwii , apologized extensively and now has a friendly attitude towards poland ( and basically everyone ) . 
  * there is nothing that would tie current germany to nazi germany or prussia ( another long-time enemy of poland ) . 
  * russia on the other hand , refuses any responsibility for wwii or mass murders/genocide like katy\u0144 or holodomor , insists that the soviet coup d'etat of every country was a big favor , makes itself an eternal victim , refuses any wrongdoing in their whole history and is generally butthurt about the end the eastern bloc . 
  you can see an example of these and more [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e68u6/missile_shield_construction_begins_in_poland_with/ctc05he ) . 
  look at how bad poland and bulgaria have always been and poor russia is the innocent victim . 
  this is not an isolated case , this is basically the official position of the russian government and what their propaganda constantly repeats . 
  * contrary to germany , current russia is the exact same country that has always desired the destruction of poland ( and succeeded for 100 + years ) . 
  my comment was about pensions , not wages . 
  pensions are paid by the state and can be changed overnight by a vote in the parliament . 
  wages are a completely kind of ball game . 
  the politicians have direct control of the average pension , the median pension , the maximum pension and the minimum pension . 
  what about telef\u00f3nica , deutsche telekom , orange and bt ? 
  they are pretty huge . 
  telef\u00f3nica is present in all south america and europe , telekom is even a major carrier in the us ... 
  i saw some data ( do n't have the source right now ) that average greek pensions are ** currently ** still double that of baltic countries . 
  people argue `` but baltics are cheaper '' . 
  yes , 20 % , not 50 % . 
  debunk away . 
  edit : a [ quick-and-dirty google shows that greek pensions are still higher than german ones as of jan 2015 ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/26/eurostat-greek-pensions-average-e882/ ) . 
  882 $ in greece , 504 $ in poland and 242 $ in lithuania . 
  and i can guarantee that my grandma does n't get * anywhere * close to 500 $ . 
   still waiting for your explanation about japan . 
  6 bullet points and nothing about my counter example . 
  weird . 
  because you base it on a kindergarten assumption that gdp and assets are somehow the same . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8xaxjx9wj8 a video is hardly evidence . 
  additionally i do n't have 12 minutes to search for the two pieces of data that are needed . 
  i 'll accept any source of statistics , thanks . 
   i explained to you how the gdp can be considered assets , you can explain how unicorns can be considered leprechauns , that does n't make any less ** wrong ** . 
  gdp and asset are very well understood economic concepts and are in no way equivalent . 
   never said that . 
  yeah you did . 
   and i was right , usa 's growth is superior to france . 
  do n't weasel out of your word , nor move goalposts . 
  you did n't say * superior * , or * bigger * or * greater * . 
  you said `` will dwarf '' other countries . 
  it was bigger a few years , the same a few others and actually smaller in others . 
  in short , you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you said greece 's fate was sealed with the euro . 
  you provided no source . 
  you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you said that greece went overboard with borrowing at germany 's interest rate . 
  you provided no source . 
  you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you said greece 's deficit `` crashed several times '' . 
  you provided no source . 
  you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you said usa gdp growth will dwarf `` every one of those countries '' . 
  you provided no source . 
  you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you said poland had double digit growth . 
  you provided no source . 
  you were ** wrong ** . 
  * you are now claiming that somehow ** gdp ** is the same as ** assets ** . 
  you are again providing no source . 
  and you are ** wrong ** . 
  it 's time for you to provide sources and back your arguments . 
  there 's many more people wrong on the internet and [ i do n't have time to disprove everyone one by one ] ( https://xkcd.com/386/ ) . 
   it 's like they 're proud of their suffering and eager to see others go through the same nope . 
  not eager . 
  more like * `` unwilling to pay for others that have it better than us , and are still complaining '' * . 
  and it is a popular opinion . 
  [ but how can you afford more than one potato ? 
  keep in mind that eurozone countries also are part of imf . 
  they are paying twice , and the imf part is the smaller one , iirc . 
  i call bullshit on your `` working in securities '' . 
  if you think [ gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_domestic_product ) = [ asset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asset ) you probably are n't more than a teenager . 
  it was n't very effective , then ... try translating it to russian next time :p, 
  so we agree : as long as your have assets to provide as collateral your get low interest rates . 
  learn to read :  duh !, 
  but if he gets a loan for the 100 % value of ** his assets ** he will get the same rate than a `` deadbeat boyfriend '' for 100 % of ** his assets ** . 
  a-s-s-e-t-s . 
  if the poor person has 100 $ of assets and 0 $ income , you can not take the interest rate they get for a 1000 $ loan and compare it to a 100k $ loan to a guy who has a net worth of 2m $ and an income of 300k $ . 
  if all the people that work in `` securities '' are as dense and have reading comprehension as low , i am not surprised about the economic meltdown ... 
   deficit is directly related to the debt . 
  the deficit is almost by definition less than the debt ( unless you somehow manage to take out  100 % loans ) . 
  sure is . 
  debt is accumulated deficit . 
  does n't change my point : greece had stable debt and ~ 0 deficit until 1980 . 
  then started to have 8 % deficit and by 1998 they had more than 100 % gdp in debt . 
   after the recession . 
  well , if one recession makes your country collapse , the debt was n't * sustainable * , was it ?
