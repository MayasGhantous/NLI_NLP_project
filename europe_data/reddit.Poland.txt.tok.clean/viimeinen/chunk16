  economy is cyclical , you can not assume the situation will * always * be positive ... 
   technically no . 
  if x < 2 , x is considered grammatically to be singular ( in france at least , i do n't know in english ) . 
  afaik , anything  1.0 is plural . 
  like `` 1.5 liter ** s ** of milk '' or `` the average human has 1.9 arm ** s ** '' . 
  actually , anything < 1.0 is also plural `` 0.5 liter ** s ** of coke '' . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker , tho . 
  i did not see that comment . 
  and technically 1.2 * is * order ** s ** of magnitude , 
  you seem not to grasp the * proportional to income * aspect . 
  of course a wealthy businessman can get a big loan , he has big income ( or assests as collateral ) . 
  but if he gets a loan for the 100 % value of his assets he will get the same rate than a `` deadbeat boyfriend '' for 100 % of his assets . 
  the only difference is in one case it 's millions of euros , in the other it 's hundreds . 
   are you saying investors on the capital market are dumb for lending money to france are we talking the same investors that lent money to greece ? 
   and you have all the information to prove they 're doing a mistake ? 
  i have no idea if they are doing a mistake . 
  if you knew how to read you 'd know that my * first * sentence in this argument was `` i have no idea about the french economy '' . 
  i never claimed they are * making * a mistake ( learn to write ) . 
  i just said `` they are warning for 20 years and france has n't collapsed '' is a worthless argument , cause it took greece 30 years to collapse and greece is much smaller . 
   why do n't you disclose or use this information and make billions ? 
  even if i knew , the first rule of investing is `` * the market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent * '' . 
  it 's like investing 101 . 
   oh right , because you know nothing . 
  sure , ygritte . 
  i am overwhelmed by the tons of ~ ~ sources and data ~ ~ * bullshit and wishful thinking * you have provided . 
   i said `` china 's '' and then used `` growth '' in singular . 
  learn to read . 
  learn to write , we 'll progress much faster . 
   where the fuck did i say that ? 
  where the fuck did i mention who was to blame ? 
  ...  greece was able to borrow at germany 's interest rate , so they went overboard . 
  which is n't even true ...  in 81-97 not once they went under 6 % deficit , reaching as high as 14 % . 
  since 1998 ( euro timeline ) unitl 2008 ( crisis ) they only exceeded 6 % once , in 2004 ( i imagine for the stadiums ) . 
  --  bill gate 's debt and your unemployed deadbeat boyfriend 's debt is n't valued the same on the financial market . 
  free til for you today . 
  another bullshit argument : bill gates has enormous income and the other guy has 0 income . 
  we are talking about debt/gdp ratio , so debt ** proportional to income ** . 
  bill gates makes billions of dollars a year from investments . 
  rest assured if gates wanted to borrow 50 billion dollars , the interest would n't be valued so low . 
   cool , now try with poland and china 's double digit growth . 
  [ poland has never had double digit growth . ] ( https://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=932594400000&amp;tend=1374444000000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  do you have ** any ** idea what you 're talking about ? 
   you know , because `` growth is growth '' it is . 
   said the guy who did not link to anything . 
  https://i.imgur.com/ixs448g.png  with the euro , greece was able to borrow at germany 's interest rate , so they went overboard . 
  that is a bullshit argument . 
  * they let me , do i did it , therefore it 's their fault for letting me . 
  it 's not even true , greece 's debt was accumulated in the 90 's , during the euro , thanks to the low interest rates , the debt/gdp ratio ** decreased ** . 
    greece 's debt started skyrocketing in 1981 ,  and crashed several times . 
  it 's normal for countries in development . 
  false . 
  in 81-97 not once they went under 6 % deficit , reaching as high as 14 % . 
  since 1998 ( euro timeline ) unitl 2008 ( crisis ) they only exceeded 6 % once , in 2004 ( i imagine for the stadiums ) . 
   france is not a country in development , therefore the comparison does not stand . 
  debt is debt . 
   yes , because all those said countries did not grow at actual huge rate . 
  want to adds poland or even the usa to the graph and see what happens ? 
  yeap , they will dwarf every one of those countries . 
  false . 
  [ here is the us gdp growth compared to france . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:usa:fra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=932594400000&amp;tend=1374444000000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) * slightly * bigger at best , generally the same . 
  well , if you have a sector of your population with extremely high infection rates , it 's easier to get infected ... 
   not really orders of magnitude , though -- more than one order of magnitude . 
  where did i ( or anyone else ) claim * anything * to do with * orders of magnitude * ? 
  are we arguing against totally made up shit again ? 
   the person i replied used the term . 
  it 's a common topic on the subreddit , you 're not the first one or the last on to throw it around . 
   however , most countries were ` obliged ' to take it , as they could n't devalue their currencies . 
  they always had option b , it just was much worse . 
  they chose the bailout because it was much better than the alternative . 
  nobody forced them to take the debt in the first place . 
  it 's like you are `` forced '' to call an ambulance after shooting yourself in the foot . 
  they knew they would n't be able to devaluate when joining the euro and they joined anyway . 
   they had a debt to gdp ratio of 22.6 % in 1980 . 
  the interest on that debt was absolutely sustainable . 
  i have n't said anything about ** debt ** in 1980 , i said ** deficit ** . 
   they went up to 100 % and held it there ( sustainable ) until 2007/8 . 
  so sustainable that it made the country collapse . 
   you ca n't really say that the jobs were n't real . 
  i did n't * say * , i * asked * . 
  you absolutely * can * , given the correct data . 
  you have provided nothing to disprove it . 
  they had several years with 12 % deficit in the 90s . 
  if during those years there were more public sector jobs , you can very well say they were n't real . 
   wrong . 
    it did not took three decades for greece to collapse . 
  greece 's fate was sealed when the implemented the euro . 
  so , far from thirty years . 
  citation needed . 
  random blaming of euro belongs to / r/circlejerk . 
  greece 's debt started skyrocketing in 1981 . 
  collapsed in 2008 . 
  27 years , not 30 , if you want to be * really * precise . 
   france 's economy is not a bubble . 
  there has never been a very strong economic growth , which is the main `` feature '' of an economic bubble . 
  there is no real estate speculation like in spain , there where no big recession in 2008 like in anglo saxon countries . 
  on no criteria can you make the assumption that there is a bubble in france . 
  it 's something i 've never read anywhere even in the economist . 
  it 's a very silly thing to say . 
  i understand the general butthurt sentiment , but please re-read my post and note that i used `` bubble '' , in quotation marks and offered a second definition of what i mean : * that it can not collapse * .
