  want a third one ? 
  * is on borrowed time * . 
   if anything , it 's the opposite of a bubble that 's happening in france . 
  a slow morbid unexciting growth . 
  comment on a graph of france showing the biggest growth among a bunch of countries . 
  cool story , bro . 
   he has a phd from london school of economics . 
  granted not in pure economics , but i 'm going to guess that he knows plenty about economics and finance . 
  yeah , but there are people on reddit who do n't agree !, 
  he must be so dumb !!, 
  / s  and for the record i agree with him . 
  yes , devaluing helps , but it 's kind of a pussy way out . 
  drop your salaries . 
  increase efficiency . 
  come up with a big idea , get it to start working , loan some money and make it big . 
   yea sure inflation helps , but finland could just plain use some good companies that could sell product . 
  the good old nordic state backed capitalism needs to find a winner again and we 're good , especially with so much potential to stimulate once we find something good to spend stimulus money on . 
  do n't stimulate for the sake of stimulating though . 
  that is exactly the attitude i 'd expect from a nordic country , and one i think will work quite well . 
  i imagine it 's not something you broadcast to everybody ... you tell your closest friend and any medical personnel that has to come in contact with your blood . 
  [ just ask them if they speak russian first . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e42cl/people_with_hivaids_in_europe_as_of_population/ctbk1o4 ), 
  that 's great and all , but as i said , if plan a fails , you buy in german makro ( still cheaper than retail , wholesale possible , no restrictions ) and sell in poland . 
   yeah , like finland which has swedish minority and therefore swedish as second national language ? 
  hence , official language . 
   which state forces their own citizens to speak the only official language ? 
  every state on earth . 
  you can not go to poland and start speaking spanish or swahili to everybody . 
   also you did n't give me statistics about how russian estonians are making 90 % of crime and hiv infections . 
  see here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e42cl/people_with_hivaids_in_europe_as_of_population/ctbe88f and here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e42cl/people_with_hivaids_in_europe_as_of_population/ctbk1o4, 
  so doing some math ...  24 % have 83 % of cases ( russians )  76 % have 17 % of cases ( non-russians )  average is 0.75 0.75 * 0.83 / 0.24 = ** 2.6 % ** hiv positive among ethnic ** russians ** 0.75 * 0.17 / 0.76 = ** 0.16 % ** hiv positive among ethnic ** estonians ** holy shit that 's scary . 
  you should have really sent some of those to poor eesti ... 
   have been talking about `` borrowed time '' for over two decades now i have no idea about the french economy , but you do realize that it took three decades for greece to collapse , do you ? 
  and for those 30 years they really enjoyed nice growth and prosperity . 
  the fact that it has been two decades alone , does n't mean it 's not a `` bubble '' or that it can not collapse . 
  specially in the case of france , with such a big economy it could 50 years to become unsustainable , and then burst hard . 
  as i said , i have no idea about the specific numbers , just do n't take `` they have been wrong for 20 years '' as a sign `` they will be wrong forever '' . 
  as is said [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e2rea/latvian_mep_concerned_about_the_low_quality_of/ctbiqw2 ) , either register in germany or buy them at makro . 
   manufactured foodstuffs that the large multinationals sell here . 
  do n't buy it . 
  buy local products , even if they are more expensive . 
  you can complain about coffee , electronics and machinery , but you should n't complain about food that has local alternatives . 
  which grows the german market , and thanks to economies of scale , making it even more efficient and cheaper , while having the opposite effect on cz market . 
   distributors can have geographic restrictions on their contract which prevents them from selling outside their allotted region technically ** they ** are n't . 
  you can start a german company . 
  they would be selling the products to a german company on germany territory . 
  as a last measure , you can always buy at a wholesale `` shop '' like makro , where they do n't have any restrictions ... 
  which inflates the german market , and thanks to economies of scale , making it even more efficient and cheaper , while having the opposite effect on your local market . 
  do n't buy it . 
  buy polish products , even if they are more expensive . 
  you can complain about electronics and machinery , but you ca n't say poland does n't produce food . 
  i agree with you . 
  there is nothing to prevent someone to hire/buy a truck , go to any distributor/wholesale market in eastern germany , buy a literal truckload of detergent and sell it in poland . 
  if the quality is really better and the end-prices in shops are the same , a very small premium will cover the extra transportation costs . 
   the n900 was n't released until november 2009 . 
  the iphone model was a 3gs at that point , that means phone / video / camera / gps / and yes copy paste . 
  the n900 had all that as well . 
  an even better camera actually , plus multitasking . 
   little of that matters to an average consumer the argument was '' * what was awesome about the iphone is that it was a phone that basically worked like a computer . 
  and maemo 5 was nothing like that experience at all . 
  * '' , which is ludicrous . 
  * maemo 5 was * literally * a computer with a phone radio added . 
  open the terminal , you have all your linux programs available , even apt-get . 
  * ios was an ipod with a phone radio added . 
  a device with which you can do what apple tells you , how apple tells you , when apple tells you . 
   to the average consumer an iphone 3gs let you do a lot of stuff , easily . 
  you could browse the web like on a computer , you could navigate by phone , all those were available on the n900 and worked much better . 
  you could chose your gps map provider ( offline maps , of course ) , you could install different browsers and browser plugins ( mozilla-based ) . 
  and you had a physical keyboard ( like a computer ) so you could write while seeing the whole screen . 
  and a phone app with seamless integration of mms , skype , gtalk and other voip providers . 
  and a messaging app with perfect integration of 9 providers , yahoo and google among them . 
  and a very nice music player ( maybe this was better on ios thanks to the ipod experience ) . 
  and a great photo album . 
  pdf reader . 
  office suite . 
  file browsers ( sd card ) . 
  all there from the start . 
   and you could download and play advanced games . 
  this is where nokia dropped the ball . 
  the promised an app-store , never delivered . 
  the phone shipped with spectacularly looking 3d game demos , but the only real game was angry birds . 
   while the n900 might be your favorite phone ever the average consumer has no idea what it is i know !, 
  and i even know why !, 
  because nokia did absolutely zero marketing . 
  they had the best phone on the market for many months , but due to internal turmoil ( the maemo division was the ugly duckling ) they poured all their marketing effort in their abysmal symbian phones . 
  the result : the whole maemo division resigned after the n9 and formed their own company , which is doing okay . 
   or what half of you just said means . 
  except cli , nothing i said is very exotic , and i only brought it up because you suggested ios is more computer-like than maemo . 
  which is like saying that ios is more powerful than osx . 
   it 's about the consumer the end user not a well versed computer expert . 
  that 's why you need marketing , which the n900 had exactly 0 . 
  nokia killed the n900 and a few years later , itself . 
  they launched the n900 in 2009 . 
  and they let it die : no marketing , no app-store , no support . 
  `` forcing bailouts '' must be the biggest oxymoron continuously repeated around here . 
   just have nokia develop a new smartphone . 
  it 's a win-win solution : the finnish economy will be instantly fixed , and the world will have access to amazing indestructible smartphones . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jolla ( not the same , tho ... ), 
  imagine how strong nokia was , they even managed to get people to buy windows phones . 
   what was awesome about the iphone is that it was a phone that basically worked like a computer .
