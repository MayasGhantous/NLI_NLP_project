  and maemo 5 was nothing like that experience at all . 
  maemo 5 was leaps and bounds ahead of ios at the time , and android for that matter . 
  maemo was exactly like a computer ( even cli access by default ) , with access to all the software available to debian at the time . 
  ios was like an ipod with a browser and phonecall capability . 
  ios had no copy and paste and no multitasking , ffs , hell maemo even holds its own today . 
  nokia dropped the ball on the app-store side ( eternal promise , never materialized , no apps ) and on the marketing side . 
  they basically never really believed in the project . 
  they had some hardware issues that did n't help , but that could be fixed with a drop of epoxy . 
  to this day i find the n900 the best smartphone i ever had by a big margin . 
  i still own two for hobby projects . 
  that was such a terrible move . 
  i had the [ nokia n900 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n900 ) . 
  to this date , best phone i ever used , and it was basically just a prototype . 
  they had so much potential . 
  the system did all android could with 1/4th of the hardware requirements . 
  real multitasking , superb skype integration , real keyboard for texting , decent battery live , modern apps . 
  but instead they decided to dump everything and use windows . 
  no wonder that most of the employees that worked on that project quit and started [ a new company ] ( https://jolla.com/ ) . 
  not with * that * attitude ... 
  finland 's main exports were paper and nokia phones . 
  neither is doing great in the 21st century . 
   or maybe it 's the fucking euro , that helps germany export and fucks everyone else in the arse ? 
  how is the euro helping germany with its exports but hurting finland with ... its exports ? 
  how are swedish car lately ? 
  chinese ? 
   you are right , but the point of austerity is exactly a reduction of gdp . 
  it is not a byproduct of austerity , it is a key goal of it . 
  absolutely false . 
  key goal is reduction of government spending . 
  the reduction of gdp is * exactly * `` a byproduct '' since the gdp was relying excessively on government spending . 
  would you rather we go back to our car * hobby * ? 
  re-reading , you 're right . 
  somehow the wording was very confusing . 
  remind me please where are canada and latin * america * located ? 
  neither do i. 
  care to explain ? 
  because evil troika !, 
  and banksters !, 
  and illuminati !, 
  and my axe !, 
   finnish flair  alcohol analogy checks out . 
   greece did in the past , pre-bubble , have `` actual '' employment . 
  it was n't wealthy , but almost everyone had a job . 
  important question : were those private sector jobs ? 
  greece had a very big deficit starting 1980 . 
  if the government was employing people and paying them with borrowed money , then they were n't real jobs . 
  nope , that was sarcasm . 
  look at the end :  put a baltic nation or poland in there and the graphs for germany , italy and france will be barely visible because of the amount the scale will expand . 
  [ poland 's gdp has n't stopped growing for in the last 13 years .

  my bad !, 
  after watching the recent videos , i 'm afraid you are going to need to produce a source before i can believe that `` most '' of them are refugees . 
  gold reserves are included in the total . 
  they have $ 360b total reserves , out of this $ 48bn is in gold . 
  source : http://www.cbr.ru/eng/hd_base/?prtid=mrrf_m, 
  thanks for the updated version . 
  but as the article says , it could go either way from here ... 
  well , then as long as you only get caught every third time , it seems like a profitable operation ...

  edit : oh russkies ... downvoting a fact with source . 
  nice move . 
  honestly , much less vodka , kalashnikov fire and random blowing up of stuff than i expected ... maybe they do n't want to bring work to the party ... 
  why ? 
  is smuggling sausages so profitable that people risk going to jail for it ? 
   guess we are just born to ~ ~ communicate with ~ ~ * spy on * everyone near us haha since nobody can understand you there is little * communicating * going on :p, 
  swedes did n't really * occupy * , at least not in the sense of the partitions of poland , it was more like a 5 year war . 
  and you * were so excited to think you finally knew some ~ ~ geography ~ ~ languages * ... , 
  and it means `` appearance '' in polish . 
  ` murican , of course . 
  why ? 
   there have even been reports of rocket-propelled grenades fired in bars . 
  til drunken brits are a bunch of sissies . 
  the political reasons make sense , tho . 
  if two countries merge the small one kind of `` gives up independence '' , as the bigger one will always have majority votes in any controversial decision . 
  the eu also makes it unnecessary , so we can all be friends , 
  the other two choices were pre-hitler and pre-stalin , so it was n't a hard competition :p, 
   do n't forget it was totaly legal . 
  what is not legal and the real proplem is occupation which happening still . 
  why is the occupation not legal ? 
  if it 's not legal , why does it persist ? 
  ( genuine curiosity , i know very little about the subject ), 
   realize % 59 of the crimean population is ethnic russians . 
  ironically , the country with most valid historic claim to crimea would be turkey , due to the crimean tatars . 
   did you ever see the so called `` kurdistan '' maps ? 
  nearly % 90 of this turkish kurdistan region consist former armeanian lands which armenians were living until the genocide . 
  so no kurds were n't even a notable minority for like a century ago . 
  source ? 
   kurds are a majority in some southeastern cities , it is a fact but if you think all of the 11 million kurds lives in se turkey , you are dead wrong . 
  there are 4 million kurds in istanbul alone , i am not even count other western cities like izmir , bursa ... from wikipedia : * the largest ethnic minority in istanbul is the kurdish community , originating from eastern and southeastern turkey . 
  although the kurdish presence in the city dates back to the early ottoman period , [ 168 ] the influx of kurds into the city has accelerated since the beginning of the kurdish -- turkish conflict with the kurdistan workers ' party ( i.e. 
  since the late 1970s ) . 
  [ 169 ] about * *** two to three million *** * residents of istanbul are kurdish , * they probably would n't mind to go back if they had their own country ... 
  to be fair , many british people ( probably not you personally ) love to bring up past wars into arguments . 
  discussion with a frenchman ? 
  waterloo . 
  disagree with a german ? 
  wwii . 
  an american does n't share your views ? 
  maybe not literally `` sue the authorities '' , but `` get a lawyer involved '' .
