  bad poland !, 
  how dare you not die in silence !, 
  not just you , it 's news to me as well . 
  i did n't go to school in poland , tho ... 
   really . 
  really your trolling is getting predictable and boring . 
  well , that 's the point . 
  i 've never changed my statement : ** equality ** . 
  it 's not a creativity contest , you know ? 
  no wonder you 're all over the place ...  i 'm an atheist . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i guess it 's too complicated for you to understand anything that does n't fit the lefty hive mind . 
  i could n't care less , tbh . 
   another groundless accusation . 
  '' * why just two and why adults ? 
   start looking for that `` homophobia '' in my comments that 's funny , man !, 
   i 'd really like to see what 's that according to a fanatic . 
  damn fanatics , pretending gays are human beings ... ps : this one was good , but a bit dry . 
  try spewing more vitriol next time !, 
   you wrote the other half , i just fixed that for you . 
  not really . 
   sadly , you 're again repeating the same slogans and accusations as i said , you can call truth and facts whatever you want , does n't change them . 
   which is quite amusing , yes , it is . 
  very much !, 
   but makes absolutelly no sense . 
  i do n't doubt it . 
   you may call that `` truth '' or `` arguments '' well , they are the truth , so no need for me to argue about them . 
   but that 's just primitive trolling i wish . 
  i wish ...  and i do n't see a reason to respond in the same manner . 
  you ca n't . 
  i respond with facts , you ca n't respond with facts because you only have the bible . 
  it 's not that you do n't see a reason , you simple ca n't . 
   you should do it first before ranting about it i am the only one providing links and sources . 
  you do n't have anything to give me to read in the first place . 
  it 's what happens when you base your argument on homophobia . 
   and when you 're at that , try to find something `` homophobic '' in my comments . 
  oh , nice one !, 
  that was funny , i actually chuckled a bit . 
  mister '' * why just two and why adults ? * '' . 
  nice one indeed !, 
   i guess it 's enough to have a different opinion to be called `` enemy '' nah , a can repect having a different opinion . 
  liking a different sports team . 
  defending a different taxation model . 
  those are fine . 
  do n't pretend that people call you `` enemy '' or downvote you or laugh at you because `` you have a different opinion '' . 
  having a different opinion is fine , creating laws based on hate is not . 
  big difference . 
   by the fanatics . 
  those fanatics that said the earth is not the center of the universe , freed the slaves and gave women the right to vote . 
   p.s. 
  you still do n't get this example of `` discrimination '' . 
  you have given absolutely no example of discrimination . 
  are you hallucinating arguments now ? 
   i 'd say that i 'm disappointed if i 'd expect rational discussion with you . 
  `` i 'm disappointed you do n't take my irrational hate of homosexuals as a rational argument '' . 
  i 'm sure you are also disappointed you ca n't use fallacies as arguments . 
  please , please keep writing pearls like these !, 
  i never interacted with a homophobe before , i must say it 's more than i expected . 
  spectacular , almost like time travel to the past !, 
   ... for privillages equal to the heterosexual couples . 
  nice half sentence . 
  care to write the other half ? 
  or are you afraid it 'll sound silly ? 
   you makes no arguments , that 's interesting , but sadly , not true . 
  you can stick your fingers in your ears , but that does n't make the arguments go away . 
  if you ca n't refute them , just admit it , negating the obvious is quite crass . 
   just repeat slogans , call the truth what you want , it does n't change facts . 
  is it a coping mechanism ? 
   so do n't expect me to take it seriously . 
  oh , believe me , i do n't . 
  i would n't expect a racist to take race equality seriously or a misogynist to take gender equality seriously or a creationist to take evolution seriously . 
  people who reject reality wo n't be convinced , the just serve as a cautionary tale for future generations . 
  role , by the way , you 're playing perfectly !, 
  ( thanks again , btw ) . 
   calling someone a `` homophobe '' ( whatever that is ) oh , let me help you !, 
  here , read up : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homophobia . 
  hth !, 
   and whineing about ad hominem yeah ... it must suck to use fallacies and being called on them . 
  how dare people not let you cheat and lie !, 
  the nerve !, 
  ( the irony of that statement is delicious , tho ! ), 
   is not any argument . 
  well ... arguments are arguments ( i though that was obvious too , but you never know ) . 
  calling you fallacies is just fun , like dessert after veggies !, 
  ps : i really enjoy seeing you melt down , i always wondered what would happen if one confronts a racist or a homophobe with the fact that all humans deserve the same treatment . 
  i did expect ad-hominems of course , but i never thought to see arguments like your famous * why just two and why adults ? * . 
  i have to admit , i expected more bible quotes tho ... 
   there was no argument there to discuss with . 
  sorry , your jedi powers are not working . 
  negating the problem wo n't make it go away . 
  those pesky human beings will keep asking for equality !, 
   again this hypocritic whineing ?
