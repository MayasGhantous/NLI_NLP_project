   why ca n't you into putting 4 consonants together like glorious macedonia ? 
  [ you fucking casuals ... ] ( https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/bezwzgl%c4%99dny ), 
  it 's their opinion , and they are entitled to it . 
  as long as they do n't put words in someone else 's mouth to pretend to be the victim of some imaginary attack , it 's fine by me . 
  well , polan stronk , germany can relax now ... , 
  i do n't care to be honest . 
  just do n't pretend op was some kind of body-controlling monster when he just made a legislation-related question . 
  your attitude just fuels the stereotypical feminist professional victim image that is so popular on reddit these days . 
  sure , but that is not my point . 
  my point is that neither is `` the norm '' , which i believe is the origin of `` normal '' . 
  will people get less offended and quit downvoting if we use `` extraordinary '' ? 
  ( out of the ordinary , so basically the same as abnormal , but with positive connotation ), 
  til, 
  sorry , i do n't speak legalese . 
  and i highly doubt a google search in english will give the status of the '' * 50 ( +6 ) countries , 230 languages , 743m people ... 1 subreddit * '' . 
  cash ? 
  hmmmm ... can i interest you in some good polish workers instead ? 
  ^ ( sorry that 's all the swedish i know ... ), 
   i do n't think there 's any point in arguing with people who think starting a world war is better than mismanaging your finances first of all , nobody thinks starting a war is better than mismanaging your finances so you can go ahead can quit your bullshit right there . 
  we are talking about debt , not war crimes . 
  second of all , last time i checked germany started wwii , not wwi . 
  the versailles treaty imposed excessive reparations after wwi . 
  wwi was the result of a [ clusterfuck of tensions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/powder_keg_of_europe ) and unresolved hatred and assigning sole blame on germany is [ way too simplistic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historiography_of_the_causes_of_world_war_i ) . 
  third of all , the reparations imposed on germany were excessive . 
  key words being imposed and excessive . 
  nobody is arguing that starting/losing a war should n't carry a cost , but the reparations should not be * vengeance * . 
  greece 's debt can not be labelled as imposed or excessive since they took the loans willingly over 30 years and the amount to repay is directly calculated from the amount they received . 
   dismiss immense generosity because it also had upsides for the other party . 
  context is important . 
  germany ( and finland , and the netherlands , and slovakia , and estonia ) are being asked to forgive debt to greece , the reason being `` solidarity '' . 
  and an example/precedent given `` london 1953 '' . 
  well , in london 1953 , the reason was not `` solidarity '' but `` first line of defence against a soviet aggression/influence '' . 
  you call it `` immense generosity '' , i call `` buying safety '' . 
  besides , what do finland , slovakia , etc care about london 1953 ? 
  they were doing the forgiving there , so how is that a reason to forgiving here again ? 
  when is some solidarity going to come * their * way ? 
  you do realize that germany is not the only country against a straight-up debt reduction , do you ? 
  except france , italy and cyprus , every other country is against it !, 
  worry away , i do n't see how germany ( destroyed by war an in need of rebuilding ) getting a relief of arbitrary reparations in the middle of the cold war should mean that greece ( vastly inflated by excessive spending ) must get a relief of willingly taken debt in the middle of the biggest prosperity period in the history of europe . 
  communism is gone , russia is n't  the thing is , those agreements were signed and they can not ( legally ) be changed . 
  actually there was a clause about the end of communism . 
  if germany ever re-united ( assuming a de-facto end of communism at least in east germany ) , some debts would be un-suspended . 
  all in all , it took germany almost 100 years to pay those debts ( 1918-2010 ) . 
   i 'm sorry men ca n't get pregnant for the most part . 
  it 's actually 100 % of men , last time i checked . 
   i 'm still not ceding control over my body to any random dude out there . 
  holy cow , nobody asked you to !, 
  that is not * at all * the discussion . 
  fact : ( most ) european countries allow abortion fact : abortion means a woman can unilaterally decide not to have a baby question : does any country have a law in which the father can unilaterally decide `` not to have a baby '' , by giving away his parental status ? 
  lol . 
  context ? 
  so is albinism ... would you say that an albino cat is `` normal '' ? 
  the problem with `` abnormal '' is that it has a negative connotation . 
  what about we use unusual ? 
  extraordinary ? 
  what about * fabulous * ? 
  i 'm quite out of the current news with polish politics and i am quite surprised with this and terribly disappointed ( checked in hope of a translation error , but nope ) . 
  he actually seemed like a potential alterative to po/pis for a while ... 
    the bad thing about it is that it does strip the man of his rights . 
   in what way ? 
  parenthood comes with a set of parental obligations . 
  you ca n't wish your way out of them . 
  if i understand op correctly , their point is that a woman can `` wish them away '' unilaterally by getting an abortion , a man ca n't . 
  op dropped this -  / s, 
   the vast majority coming via the mediterranean are by the nature of illegally coming to europe . 
  agree , but it 's not what you understand when some talks about '' * criminal * immigrants '' . 
  the term '' * illegal * immigrant '' is used for this . 
   i agree but there is n't and greece going the grueling public sector cuts will lead to their ability to stop migrants going to other eu countries difficult . 
  there should be a agency equally funded by all members that would help with border controls , so no country has to spend their own money . 
  i do n't think anyone would oppose since it 's obvious most immigrants come through towards the richer countries in the north ... 
  swedish detected . 
   kumi = rubber or the more obvious , ** gum ** , 
   remember croatian linguistic slavic purism in place of many serbian loanwords from greek and latin , funny example then ... 
  in croatian you used * sigurnosti * , which sounds like `` security/securit \u00e9 / seguridad '' , so i guess latin origin . 
  in serbian * bezbednosti * which totally sounds like the polish `` bezpiecze\u0144stwo '' , so slavic origin :p, 
  germans , almost . 
  stickstoff - stuff that suffocates, 
  best one : jamon ^ presunto which in spanish kinda sounds like `` ham ^ supposedly '', 
  i too , am too lazy to check wikipedia . 
  not all migrants are criminals 2 . 
  many countries are facing the same challenge . 
  the answer is not debt reduction , there should be other mechanisms in place for greece , hungary , italy , spain , etc. 
  i hope you understand the difference between a nuclear-armed soviet union and some immigrants on boats . 
   yes the reperations were excessive . 
  hence the reduction . 
  if you borrow 10 euros , you can not claim that paying back 10.1 is excessive . 
   if they understood that in the 1950 's , why ca n't we understand it today ? 
  better ? 
  different . 
  half of the debt germany had at the time was still unpaid versailles reparations ( which iirc hitler defaulted on , but west germany picked up again ) . 
  versailles reparations are commonly regarded as excessive and unfair . 
  not only that , also arbitrary . 
  if i lend you 10 euros there is a reasonable window of what you pay back ( 10-12 euros ) . 
  it is unfair if i ask for 500 back . 
  if i win a war an impose a zillion euros penalty , the story is different . 
  is self-interest a good reason ? 
   ** needing a strong west germany as a bulwark against communism ** , the country 's creditors came together in london and showed that they understood how you help a country that you want to recover from devastation . 
   and once we leave , they can go right back to being in charge . 
  there are currently 9,800 us troops in aghanistan . 
  they sure are tought , keeping the taliban at bay all by themselves .
