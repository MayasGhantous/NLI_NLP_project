   for my comment about it being better than nothing , all i 'm saying is the guns are here , we would use them gotcha . 
  my point was : one could argue that `` nothing '' is better since it causes way less ( mass ) murders * before * the bad guys invade you , and * when * they invade you civilians with guns will make a very little difference in modern warfare . 
   i really do n't care if people in europe have guns or not , and i 'd be happy to have all our troops leave so you can go back to butchering each other . 
  us presence has nothing to do with europeans going to war with each other . 
  it was to prevent the ussr from invading europe post-wwii and for the us to easier invade ( insert middle-east county ) now . 
   we can not be invaded because of the atlantic and pacific , not because we have guns . 
  i never questioned that point . 
   people can attack us , sure , but from geography alone , we can never be occupied . 
  * never say never . 
  *  we have all the resources we need right here . 
  [ not yet .

  i thought you meant producing for export , to recover economically . 
  if you produce for internal consumption , you face 3 problems : * you reduce your exports ( you can no longer export the apples you usually export , because you need to sell them internally ) * you increase your imports ( more apple production requires more tractors and machinery , and therefore also more oil ) * you absolutely destroy the trade balance , leading to even more massive problems . 
  keep in mind that nobody will accept the drachma as payment for industrial/agricultural machinery or oil , you will have to pay in dollars/euros/rubles which you can only get by exporting stuff . 
   why would i change the price i sell at due to new currency ? 
  well , if you mean to sell them internally the reason is clear : everyone will be much poorer ( which is the point of having your own currency , so you can devaluating and make everyone poorer so it 's cheaper and therefore slowly attract business that need cheap labor ) . 
  spectacular !, 
  does that mean `` yes '' ? 
  they all seemed to fall in the category '' [ fuck you , i like guns !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl--yvnni0i ) '' ... 
  poland , i am of dissapoint . 
  the armed forces , no less . 
   look how well the taliban does with rifles and simple bombs . 
  quite bad . 
  they used to tyranically run a country , now they are mountain guerilla warfare . 
  did they manage to annoy the us during the occupation ? 
  sure . 
  did it help them in any way to `` win '' the war , in any sense of the word ? 
  you tell me ...  in any event , it 's better than having nothing . 
  careful there , you are in / r/europe . 
  it 's a different topic altogether which there is no point of discussing now , i will just say that personally i am very happy not having guns * everywhere * in europe , * even having russia next door * . 
  many americans are very happy that they do have free access to guns . 
  let 's agree to disagree and thank god for the atlantic :p  the us ca n't be invaded anyway , so we 'll never know . 
  there are plenty of countries with a `` guns for all '' status quo , does n't seem to help them . 
   p.s. 
  you need to decide whether we are talking hypothetically or we present facts . 
  facts ? 
  greece has no foreign reserves . 
  drachma is not doable , period . 
  hypothetically , if greece had reserves . 
  this does n't change the fact that you can not make shit up and prove your statements with known economic theory . 
  stuff like `` i will rename the country to awesomeland and everyone will give me free gold bars '' does not fly . 
   i sell it all farms do n't make anymore , they are not factories . 
  same quantity would manage to get same price , since its the same demand curve . 
  i do n't understand this sentence . 
  please explain . 
   also i can use my 50 % youth unemployment rate to create food farms working on a farm is very hard , manual labor . 
  plenty of people will refuse to work on a farm , if they are not literally starving . 
  unemployment , pension and soup kitchens will be plans a , b and c.  run by the state so that people wo n't starve are we talking about the same state that even according to the greeks , is corrupt and incompetent ? 
   does n't seem to be so hard . 
  on reddit nothing is . 
   moving to linux is not necessarily a cost-saving measure , especially for large organizations , at least not right away . 
  there are costs in retraining people , in migrating software and services , hardware incompatibility and in keeping around a larger support team . 
  the support may be expensive since there may be few people with the adequate skills in microsoft-dominated ecosystems . 
  including all those costs ( and adding developing brand new software ) , all reports i 've read talk about tens of millions of euros of savings before 5 years . 
   at the same time , there can be an enforcement of libre formats for document interchange at the state level . 
  ironically , those are the biggest sore points about existing migrations . 
  the rest of the state/country/orgnizations keeps windows and can not open whatever documents . 
   if you make this merely a matter of cost then microsoft can always outbid any free software implementation . 
  no , they ca n't * always * do it . 
  they tried in munich , they failed terribly . 
  they even offered to move their german headquarters to munich , adding many jobs and taxes to the equation . 
  still did n't pay off . 
  in any case , it 's not a sustainable strategy , in the long term . 
  linux is easier and cheaper to implement every year , in part due to the previous work and experience accumulated with the pioneer projects . 
  they would go bankrupt if they gave bigger and bigger discounts every year . 
   i think you are mistaking culture for work ethic . 
  ** americans are creepily friendly with you . 
  i do n't want that shit and nor do most people here . 
  ** well ...  it has it upside . 
  since their salary is directly dependen from the client , waiters in the us are much more friendly , talkative and attentive than in europe . 
  big time difference . 
  ** to the point of annoying some people less used to it ** . 
   why would i sell cheaper than 1 $ ? 
  to sell more . 
  if you sell the same amount you have a huge trade deficit ( currently 3:1 , iirc ) , which coupled to a weak currency is catastrophic . 
  where did i say polite or rude ? 
  holy fuck , do people like to argue against their inventions ...  since their salary is directly dependen from the client , waiters in the us are much more ** friendly ** , ** talkative ** and ** attentive ** than in europe i 've been to the uk . 
  same service as germany and poland and spain . 
  polite ? 
  sure , no one insulted me . 
  did i get my food ? 
  sure . 
  friendly ? 
  not even a comparison to the us , from any european country . 
  is it pitchfork season again ?? 
  you do realize that we are talking about nokia here , right ? 
  10 years ago they were one of the biggest european companies ? 
  they could have bought any of the companies that have today taken their place , probably with change to spare . 
  but they stuck to symbian vs android and then tried to align themselves with microsoft , which was the wrong partner and too late anyway . 
  the city of munich migrated , the nyse migrated , many armies migrated ( including china ) ... what is more critical than those ? 
  ps : the entire migration costs about as much as a one-time licence renewal with microsoft . 
  then the maintenance is drastically lower . 
  economically it makes a lot of sense . 
  care to justify how more expensive oil does n't affect farming costs ? 
  or how farming prices do n't depend on production costs ? 
  seems to me like just sticking your fingers in your ears and singing ... 
  this was super informative . 
  i have one question tho ( if you happen to know more about this ) how are central and far eastern cities a backup plan if they can not feed themselves ?
