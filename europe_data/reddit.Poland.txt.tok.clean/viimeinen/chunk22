  this seems to be two contradictory ideas : let 's be poor to sustain this cities but if the enemy comes and we have to use this cities , we will starve : /, 
  ok , serious question : do gun enthusiasts ( if you happen to know any ) * really * believe that guns will protect them from the government / foreign invader ? 
  i mean , they should be aware of tanks , apache helicopters and f18 , right ? 
  palestine vs israel is pretty much how a gun vs tank battle looks like ... 
  but polan stronk ... 
  do n't forget that you do n't farm with cattle anymore , you farm with tractors , which use oil . 
  a big percentage of the price of the final product is the oil to power the tractor . 
  let 's assume a kg of apples costs 1 $ and is divided in 33 cents for the oil to farm it , 33 cents for the salary of the farmer and 33 cents to transport and distribute . 
  if you abandon the euro and go to the drachma , it will lose value ( let 's assume 50 % ) and the farmer will earn just 17 cents . 
  this will bring the price of the apples from 1 $ to 0.83 $ , but everyone in greece will be earning half of what they used to . 
  you can not possibly export enough apples to make up for it because the reduction is just not that significant . 
  this is just a thought exercise anyway , since tsipras admitted greece does not have enough foreign reserves do back a new currency , which would mean hyperinflation in case of grexit . 
  they will just not do it . 
  you do n't ? 
  welcome to politics . 
  talking to people is not making exceptions , is literally the main thing politicians do . 
  she does n't need to guarantee anything , just avert the horrible pr she got from this . 
  the head of the government is not meant to comfort children either , she should have let the girl crying and shush her for disturbing the interview ... 
  a nice pr move is not `` capitulate on your positions '' . 
  no one is asking to change any policies either . 
  how difficult is it to say : `` we can not accept all refugees , we do n't have the capacity , but i see that you seem to be very well integrated . 
  we are making an effort to help people that are so well integrated . 
  why do n't you come after the show and talk to me about your situation ? '', 
  no change in policy , not even a commitment to anything , but shitstorm averted . 
  `` let me storke you here on camera until you stop crying and then kick you out of the country '' is not a lot of empathy tbh . 
  i think she should have ceded here . 
  you can make an exception to all minors who speak perfect german and plead to you on live tv . 
  there will be dozens of them . 
  dozens !, 
   ronald reagan - number one enemy of the tutrakan village establishment !, 
   the flea is the motherland 's most dangerous enemy !, 
  destroy it !, 
  in one corner : reagan . 
  in the other corner : the flea the battle for the position of bulgaria 's top enemy starts now !, 
   \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043c does this sound `` sram '' ? 
  in polish that 's `` i shit '' . 
  yes , i still do n't know how `` osram '' ( `` i will shit [ on something ] '' ) ever got into the polish market . 
  it has it * upside * . 
  since their salary is directly dependen from the client , waiters in the us are * much * more friendly , talkative and attentive than in europe . 
  big time difference . 
  to the point of annoying some people less used to it . 
  while `` a bribe '' is \u0142ap\u00f3wka , `` to bribe '' is also `` przekupi\u0107 '' , so very similar to `` podkup '' . 
   i 'm french , and i can tell you 100 % of our population accepted english as the international language and ` de facto ' the eu language * wayoomini - du puan * i do n't think you can get 100 % of the population agree on the earth being round , much less on assuming the end of their position as dominant superpower . 
  majority ? 
  maybe , i 'm ready to believe that , but i have n't seen any statistics . 
   i 'm not saying we 're there already . 
  that is my whole point . 
  create a new party !, 
  like podemos in spain !, 
  afaiu they have admitted they do n't have enough foreign currency reserves to re-launch the drachma . 
  so it 's stay or become the new zimbabwe ( issue drachmas , see them fall down a cliff , print trillion-drachma bills and force everyone to end up using dollars or euros anyway , but without even a right to vote in the ez ) . 
   the members who voted against the deal have said that they will keep supporting their party which i find very funny . 
  * yes , we support our government , just not anything they plan to say or do in the next 3 years . 
  otherwise , total support . 
  just schedule the start 3 hours earlier . 
  you even get 1h of extra venting that way ... 
  but ... democracy !, 
  zat is not wery efficient ... w\u00f6rk griechenland !, 
  w\u00f6rk !, 
  in many countries is a university degree where you not only study the languages ' relationship in pairs , but also practice the simultaneous translation so you can listen to what someone is saying while simultaneously talking in other language without hearing what you say . 
  this bit is , maybe not crazy , but dumb . 
   when the greek government heard about the 50bn fund , they should have left ** as soon as they heard about it being in luxemburg ** . 
  that fund being located in greece ** does n't change things much ** . 
  so is the fact the fund is luxembourg the dealbreaker or a meaningless detail ? 
  i honestly can not find anything better on tv than jon stewart . 
  god bless donald trump , may he run until the primaries . 
   why do i keep reading that the greek healthcare system is in crisis well ...  doctors in greece make more than 80k per year there 's your problem !, 
   damn ... 
  in here you can get 40 '' tv for 250e , could n't you just be ** american ** out it on the credit  do n't you mean ... greek ? 
  but now it 's obama 's fault for not stopping it !, 
  \\ #thanksobama, 
  time for * world police * !, 
   people in turkey got bored of the aegean dispute nowadays , out southern border is much more exciting . 
  so macedonia * is dropping the ball lately ? 
  not giving greece some conflicts in the north ? 
  ^ ^ * ^ ^ former ^ ^ yugoslavian ^ ^ repubic ^ ^ of, 
   patrol 36 's members reportedly [ ... ] were stockpiling guns , tnt , knives and portraits of adolf hitler . 
  til hitler portraits are a commodity, 
  you are being not only condescending but also wrong . 
  i grew up in spain . 
  i have a friend in the army and one in the guardia civil . 
  one of them dropped out of school after `` tripiting '' 3o eso and reaching the age limit . 
  the other one finished eso failing 3 subjects . 
  that 's why they joined the military , the only steady job they could get with their education . 
  none of them speak english for shit . 
  they could n't tell a tourist how to get to the beach , let alone communicate clear instructions over radio in a battlefield . 
  50 years behind the iron curtain take a toll :( i 'm moderately optimistic about the future , tho . 
  and being in the eu is a great way to advance faster . 
   that means we will join the east european union i for one welcome our kraut overlords ... ps : make sure to bring your cars :d, 
   german union ( netherlands , austria , belgium ( flandern ) , luxemburg , south tyrol , maybe liechtenstein and switzerland if they want ) , you would definitely need a better name , tho ... edit : also , i 'm missing germany in that list ... 
  it 's a mix of not trusting the national politicians plus a iron-strong assurance against russian shenanigans . 
   no , the answer is russian that is a union of soviet republics , not a federation of states . 
  wait , d\u00e9ja vu ... 
   1 military this is one of the biggest problems imo . 
  * some countries in the eu want to be neutral ( se , fi , at , ie ) . 
  some others have very strong alliegances ( uk , pl both to the usa ) . 
  * there are a shitton of languages spoken across the eu . 
  demanding all soldiers to speak a common language is unrealistic . 
  hell , even agreeing on which that language should be would be hell ( looking at you , france ) . 
  keeping language-based separation penalizes greatly the structure making it very rigid .
