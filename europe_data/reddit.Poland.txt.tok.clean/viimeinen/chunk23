  not gon na happen imo . 
  there are backwards countries like poland , where we apparently support federalism but then we ask for [ opt-outs in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) because that would mean treating homosexuals like people . 
    which is the least efficient and most error prone way to do work . 
  obviously a lunar base has to be highly automated and robiticized . 
  ** every field that is simple enough for automation ** proves that robots are better , safer and more efficient than humans . 
   hence why human labor has been completely replaced by robots on earth . 
  oh wait it has n't . 
  this kind of silliness is found throughout all of your comment . 
  learn to read , dude . 
  pls . 
   those are going to backfire by making the reforms less popular in greece , something something muh sovereignty that 's possible . 
  hopefully they 'll work and people will ~ ~ appreciate ~ ~ tolerate them . 
  us social benefits are far lower as well . 
  * low taxes * extended benefits pick one . 
   the banks were bailed out immediately , and nobody talks about them anymore . 
  oh people talk about them all the time . 
  as if paying your debts was some kind of crime ...  the pensions were cut , not paid . 
  you realize that hose are not mutually exclusive , right ? 
   or are you trying to say that the greeks had to cut their pensions so they could pay their pensions ? 
  that is exactly what i 'm saying . 
  the greeks had to cut their pensions ( reduce the amount per person ) so they could pay them ( so they would have enough money to pay everybody ) . 
   cuts in greece were far , far harsher than in those countries . 
  might be , i do n't know the details page by page . 
  i know that greece 's situation was worse , so maybe the harsher cuts were necessary . 
  it 's must be hard to adjust when you are used to [ spend up to 12 % more than you earn ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ixs448g.png ) , for decades . 
  if other countries just overspent by 5 % , the impact was logically lower . 
   not to mention that it was n't a problem during the five years of pasok and nd , but suddenly a hot issue when syriza came into power . 
  because syriza tried to undo the austerity !, 
  it was like their * whole * electoral campaign ... 
   yeah , fuck democracy , right ? 
  tsipras knew he could n't in good conscience sign a deal that was the exact opposite of his campaign promises . 
  it 's only sensible and justified to consult the population for such a change in policy funny how on monday he accepted much worse terms and did n't consult anyone . 
  selective democracy ? 
   how such a thing can be seen as bad faith , i can not understand . 
  easy : it was made after the offer expired . 
  i 'd have nothing against it if they made a referendum in march , a few months before the expiration of the second bailout , not a few days after . 
  it was using democracy as an excuse to delay the negotiation . 
   if tsipras just wanted to stick to his `` end austerity '' position he would n't have needed a referendum : the referendum was necessary to allow him to sign the bailout deal . 
  as i said , on monday he signed harsher terms with no referendum . 
   `` bailouts '' that only help rich private citizens apparently being able to pay pensions is only helping the rich . 
  well , if the pensioners get 3,500 $ a month , you might have a point there ...  on following a plan that will destroy the economy somehow this plan has n't destroyed the swedish economy in the 90s , the german in the 2000s , the baltics a bit later or the portuguese , spanish or irish after that . 
  is it the plan or is it the country that has failed ? 
   when it does n't work they 'll ignore reality see above about `` ignoring reality '' and playing the victim . 
  7 or 8 success cases , 1 failure , so far . 
   bitch about corruption is it better to defend corruption ? 
   while much of the corruption was their citizens handing out bribes their government owned company could scam your own yes , that is the main source of corruption in greece , sure . 
   just in case the injury was n't enough they will add insult too . 
  [ oh ] ( http://bilder4.n-tv.de/img/incoming/origs6829791/9372734773-w1000-h960/29454205.jpg ) , [ that ] ( http://bilder2.n-tv.de/img/incoming/crop7419441/1661328162-cimg_16_9-w1200/37j81128.jpg ) [ is ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-227689-panov9free-hhgy.jpg ) [ quite ] ( http://www.pi-news.net/wp/uploads/2011/10/griechenhass.jpg ) [ amusing ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,16722048_303,00.jpg ) . 
   or am i still being too forgiving ? 
  i 'd call it partial , delusional and confrontational . 
  and pointless , since the greeks accepted the conditions towards a third bailout , despite your deep wisdom . 
   significant economies of scale you can apply earth economies of scale for cars , not for spaceships . 
  it will still cost thousands of dollars to ship every kilogram of spaceship to leo , and barring a space elevator there is nothing we can do to significantly reduce that . 
  as soon as you start scaling , the almost-free cost of putting stuff in orbit from the lunar surface catches on quick , potentially offsetting the increased costs of life support . 
   and that 's with the work being done by humans which is the least efficient and most error prone way to do work . 
  obviously a lunar base has to be highly automated and robiticized . 
  every field that is simple enough for automation proves that robots are better , safer and more efficient than humans . 
   using power generated from fossil fuels solar power on the moon can be practically free ( once installed ) and 100 % previsible ( no weather ) . 
   all of that has to be shipped from earth . 
  nope , all of that can be in 90 % made on site ( after bootstrapping ) , especially the heaviest ( metal ) parts . 
  you ship resins , filters , life support , electronics from earth . 
   making an actual spaceship from lunar regolith is , frankly , silly i know . 
  that 's why i did n't suggest it . 
   similarly , computers and electronics are impossible . 
  great strawman argument . 
  notice how i specifically only said `` metal structures '' and `` rocket fuel '' . 
  incidentally , the heaviest parts of any vehicle . 
  no computers , polymers , cushions or philly cheese steaks . 
   what about the moon as a refueling station ? 
  well , it 's 4.1 km/s delta-v from leo to lunar orbit so you suggest to make a refueling station on the moon with fuel shipped from earth ? 
  i 'm confused ...  using it for manufacture of spacecraft or for fuel just ca n't get traction with respectable people . 
  do you really feel so strongly about moon bases that you must use ad-hominems right there ? 
  in your first argument coment ? 
  wow . 
  i was going to disagree , but after checking my objection was about getting rid of the council of europe , not the european council . 
  [ silly me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qhp7vaze&amp;t=45 ) ... 
  in [ 1988 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_polish_strikes ) ? 
  he must be a genius . 
   it will stay that way for another 50 + years so ... later rather than sooner ? 
  that does n't mean that repeating `` no reforms '' makes him racist . 
  if you understand `` invest '' as `` lend money '' , then probably not . 
  there are many more forms of investing , tho ... see cosco and maersk buying ports , expanding them and hiring people in the process . 
   from past behaviour ? 
  one of the parts of the eurosummit agreement was that greece finally implement unfinished parts of the 2012 bailout , which means they did n't do it despite agreeing to . 
  thus the harsh terms , to make sure that * this time * they finally get their act together . 
  greece got into this mess precisely because they lacked austerity . 
  it took 30 years ( 1980-2010 ) but it finally exploded . 
  no one created the debts out of thin air . 
  greece accumulated them by spending more than earning . 
  if they do n't implement the reforms , erasing the debt would only mean 30 more years of great life followed by exactly the same situation . 
  so france and italy are the good guys , germany is the bad guy and 14 countries are so dumb/threatened that they side with germany against their interests ? 
   you 've sent the message that the second you have trouble expect to be dropped like a rock and kicked in the teeth the second you have trouble ? 
  or after 7 years , two bailouts , lots of corruption , unfulfilled compromises , one referendum and thousands of pictures of hitler ? 
   denmark is on a hard peg with the euro . 
  til , but it 's not a `` hard '' peg , afaiu  are they ? 
  yes , they are . 
   you realise that the only countries that are negative are euro countries , right ? 
  yes i do . 
  but doing a 2007-2015 comparison is misleading . 
  a 1999-2015 would be much more representative ( 1999 is when the exchange rate of the euro was fixed , effectively starting it 's use ) .
