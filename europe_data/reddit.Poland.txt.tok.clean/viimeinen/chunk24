  what if those countries in red grew a lot during 1999-2007 thanks to the euro ? 
  this could be just a correction ... 
   only having the state as a shareholder , while professionals actually run the company this is key . 
  in corrupt governments like southern on eastern european countries , a state company is a place to put people to whom politicians owe favors , friends , and family . 
  thus , clueless people run the company into the ground , requiring constant state public handouts . 
  should n't denmark be green ? 
  there are 11 euro countries positive , 8 negative ( keep in mind in 2008 the world economy collapse ) 3 . 
  barring greece , the positive bars are much bigger than the negative bars . 
  you have rich and poor countries on both sides . 
  malta and slovakia grew , finland and denmark shrunk . 
  i 'm not sure this disproves the point ... 
   ~ ~ estonia thinks ~ ~ ** one guy on reddit with an estonian flair implied that maybe ** we are something like the wild west . 
  ftfy, 
  do you have a source on this ? 
  i 've read it a couple of times but i ca n't find official data about the primary ( pre-debt repayment ) balance . 
  huge cost savings due to the immensely easier path to orbit from the moon than from earth . 
  if you fire a gun on the moon the bullet * almost * reaches orbit . 
  you can put stuff in orbit using a solar powered railgun on the surface , so basically for free . 
  and we would n't build sofas and iphones there , mainly metal structures for spaceships and rocket fuel . 
  you have water ( for fuel ) and aluminum , iron , magnesium and titanium ( for the structures ) . 
  the same reason why it 's bad some countries do n't want black people to vote . 
  discrimination is bad . 
  [ bullshit ] ( http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/ottomans-were-the-first-to-reach-the-moon-says-turkish-president/ ), 
  in fact that is the point of going to the moon , have an industrial center in a much smaller gravity well . 
  [ that 's a weird fetish ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=danish&amp;tbm=isch ) ... 
  you mentioned the video to highlight the problem of :  jew in any suburb/major city in europe . 
  yes , i am one of those people that dismissed the video of a jew walking in paris because there is nothing outrageous there . 
  in the russian video there were physically attacked twice and constantly insulted . 
  one `` homo '' and four `` jew '' in four hours is really not comparable . 
  if the video proves anything is that the european population apparently has nothing against jews , and the muslim immigrants are maybe unfriendly but there have no obligation to like jews . 
   because mild , pervasive antisemitism is totally ok because muslims are n't adults that should be held accountable for their vile actions they totally should !, 
  let 's do it right now !, 
  since i 'm not french please cite what are the penalties in french law for : * calling a jewish person on the street `` jew '' ( 4 offenders ) * calling a person `` homo '' ( 1 offender ) * saying that a person has come to fuck or whatever that was ( 1 offender ) * spitting ( 2 offenders , i guess it could be considered littering ) * giggling ( 1 group of 4 offenders ) * following a person on for 2 streets ( 1 offender ) those are vile , * vile * actions . 
  let 's make them pay for it . 
   ( explains the child-abuse worshipping , every single islamist country being a shit-tier hellhole , a single nobel prize among all muslims , etc. ), 
  out of topic , not in the video , meaningless and a whole different discussion . 
  i could bring up the thousands of civilians israel kills every few years , but what 's the point ? 
   just answer a single question ; do you think the behavior of said arabs is in any way acceptable ? 
  depends what do you mean by acceptable . 
  most of them are legal , so yes , it is `` acceptable '' . 
  you can go and lecture them about respect , but ca n't do much more . 
  or outlaw spitting and giggling . 
  * are they in bad taste ? 
  most of them , sure . 
  * are they crimes ? 
  most of them , not at all . 
  so you can go ahead and stop saying that people are `` acting like savages '' and commiting `` vile actions '' when they are barely bothering the guy from a distance during a 10 hour walk through some problematic areas of a big city . 
  you see way worse things on every football match and no one is calling all christians `` hooligans '' . 
  finally , just as antisemitism is wrong , your anti-muslimism is not better in any way , which makes you a hypocrite . 
  not a crime , but still , in bad taste . 
   religious country that has its government connected with its church well , there 's your problem !, 
  not enough , apparently . 
  have an upvote to compensate . 
   polish ~ ~ punrogi ~ ~ ** pierogi ** , so tasty . 
  dude , pls ... 
  i find this hilarious . 
  a german tries to do break the stereotype `` germans only think about themselves '' that has been going around lately and do something to help greece only to fall into the stereotype of `` greeks are all tax evaders '' . 
  i guess i should go steal someone 's car now ... 
   avoid bild going full retard good luck with that . 
  the point is that public sector `` spending '' is what started this mess , it 's how greece got to the point of needing the first bailout . 
  public sector spending might work for sweden or denmark but it alone by itself was clearly not the solution here . 
   i 'm obviously talking about poland , they already tried to blame the germans for the polish death camps , what else are they up to ?!, 
  i know you 're being sarcastic , but that is likely to * trigger * some folks ... 
  [ never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  spain should consider suing whoever they hired to fudge the numbers ... 
   say the word `` bitch '' does not incite violence or hate in fact in the video they are none at that lol are you serious ? 
  of course it does !, 
  that 's the whole point of saying it !, 
   and again false , i told you drop that math you are pathetic . 
  math turns against you and you tell me `` to drop that math '' ? 
  that is the weakest , most desperate argument i 've seen in a long time . 
   your stats does not account for the percentage of people that are lgbt in moscow of course not . 
  it does not need to . 
  i only used it for find out the attacks/person in berlin since the data i had is attack/person in moscow . 
  it 's called normalization . 
  look it up . 
   on one sample and still dont have a year on year data for moscow , when the russian police start take violence against gays seriously , i 'll have that data and i 'll do the math again . 
  until then i work with what data i have . 
   those stats might have been the only attact in one year nope , when you take a sample you assume it 's representative . 
  all other data ( and anecdotal evidence ) seem to give the same results . 
  therefore the sample is representative . 
   did the gay in brlin kissh each other or hold their hands ? 
  of course . 
  and they go to dark clubs at night and they get drunk and make out . 
  and they go shopping for groceries . 
  and they go on vacation . 
  and they get sick and hold each other hands at the doctor . 
  just like hetero people do ( i guess it must sound strange to a russian , but really , they are just people ) . 
   in that case why not double . 
  wish granted , i will double it for no reason at all . 
  0.0000093 x 2 = ** 0.0000186 ** attacks per day . 
  almost got close to the ** 1.43 ** attacks a day from moscow . 
  but not quite . 
   it doesnt help that they are less than 6 homophobic slurs in the videos plus two aggressions , plus threats , plus generic non-slur insults . 
  hence my number : 10 attacks . 
  it 's lower than it should , but it 's nice and round . 
   and again more nonsensical drivel , i asked you what happen when two gay poeple kiss not what happen to their perpetrators . 
  what happens when two gay people kiss ? 
  when , you get two kissing people !, 
  no one is getting hurt .
