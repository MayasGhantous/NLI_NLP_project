  you do realize that in many countries gay people can marry and have/adopt children right ? 
  they form families , are happy , get on with their lives . 
  in 99.9999 % of cases , absolutely nothing happens . 
  people just do n't give a shit that you are gay . 
  in 0.00009 % of cases : the bus driver asks them to get of the bus . 
  in 0.00001 % of cases they are attacked . 
   two gay people kiss = discrimination , insult , attact yes , that is what happens in russia , i know . 
  i have seen the video and they did n't even kiss . 
  in the west , when two gay people kiss = no one cares . 
  if someone cares it is soooo rare that it ends up in the news , like plane crash ( incidentally , also russia 's speciality ) . 
  this is a video of two actors in the one most anti-gay areas of `` the west '' , namely the souther united states : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaxorxw6gtg they hold hands . 
  they kiss . 
  they propose marriage . 
  no one gives a shit . 
  good for them . 
  people carry on with their lives . 
   homophobic attact is still on the rise  yes , from 474 cases per year to maybe 480 . 
  while ( just in berlin ) there are 10k traffic accidents a year . 
  so it means that you are 20 times more likely to have a traffic accident than to witness a homophobic attack . 
  it 's really funny to me seeing how it 's super-hard to process for your russian brain that two guys can kiss and the world not explode . 
  you are hilarious . 
  keep me entertained , please !, 
   who care about china , getting another children is also forbidden . 
  it 's a spanish saying `` here and in china '' = `` in the whole world '' --  and no whatever the definition of `` civilized word '' mean wich doesnt exist by the way  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech dude it 's right there : hate speech is , outside the law , ** speech that attacks a person ** or group ** on the basis of ** attributes such as ** gender ** , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or ** sexual orientation ** . 
  do you even read ?? 
  again , thanks for giving me the links to disprove you !, 
  you are awesome !, 
  --  wich you have not been able , i mean cant even do proper maths show me my math is incorrect , otherwise you are just grasping at straws . 
  --  wich neighborhood and part of the citiy they were again ? 
  no idea . 
  it 's irrelevant anyway . 
  in the jew video there was nothing outrageous . 
  mostly people calling him a jew and two insults . 
  annoying , sure , but no crime . 
  --  and 0 sources i used yours ( i said this three times already , lol ) --  let see  moscow 13 millions citizens  berlin : 3 milions let 's . 
  careful , i 'm going ** to use math ** !, 
  berlin : 474 attacks , 3.5 m people ( 2014 ) . 
  since an average of 4 % of people are gay , berlin has an estimated population of 140,000 homosexuals . 
  let 's use math and averages . 
  divide 474/140 ,000 = each gay person suffers 0.00338 attacks per year . 
  divided by 365 = 0,0000093 attacks per day . 
  now moscow . 
  i 'm going to be generous and just count 10 offences from the video ( there are more , but ok ) . 
  these two people suffered 10 attacks in one day . 
  let 's divide 10/2 = 5 attacks per person per day . 
  but , moscow is bigger than berlin , let 's adjust . 
  moscow has 12.2 m people ( 2015 ) , so moscow is 12.2 / 3.5 = 3.48 times bigger than berlin . 
  so adjusting 5/3 .48 = 1.43 attacks per day . 
  * in ** berlin ** each homosexual suffers ** 0.0000093 ** attack per day on average ( 1 per 300 years ) . 
  * in ** moscow ** each homosexual suffers ** 1.43 ** attacks per day on average ... if they just hold hands and keep themselves to crowded street during daylight . 
  --  what does that have to do with what i wrote , what is the link with my previous messages ? 
  here it is :   btw , i do n't want to even imagine if they kissed ... or they walked at night ... or in small alleys . 
   yeah bla bla bla ( completely delusionnal ) happy to help !, 
   --  what do you want sources where people walk among people on the street that are dying or in need ?? 
  dying or in need ? 
  lol , textbook strawman argument . 
  look at what i wrote :  in moscow ** you threaten to beat a couple of gays ** and ** no one even stops to look ** . 
  address that . 
  --  gay people kiss = attact , insult and discrimination in western countries ( it doesnt help that its on the rise ) in western countries , two gays kiss : * you ask them to get off the bus = you 're fired . 
  * you insult them = you 're fired * you punch them = you 're fired , expelled from school and the fbi investigates you . 
  in russia : * you ask them to get off the bus = no example * you insult them = nothing * you shoulder-ram them = nothing , people do n't even notice . 
  that is the difference . 
   saying `` come over '' is not a threat '' lol . 
  saying `` come over you gay '' after you just shoulder-rammed him is threat here and in china . 
   and `` bitches '' is not hate speech lol . 
  maybe in russia . 
  in the civilized world it 's an insult and hate speech if directed to a gay man or a woman . 
   i gave you 5 links with clear example where it happen in broad daylight in european capital , recent sources at that less than 1 year . 
  yes , and it made the news . 
  in this video , some 20 people saw the incident and no one batted an eyelash . 
  `` oh , just some fags getting beaten , business as usual '' . 
  also , as i said , most of those links were either at night or against gay symbols , not random gay people . 
   i never talked about `` level of hatred '' but assault and homophobic attact , you have provide until now o sources no , i provided 0 because i just used your sources to prove how your argument is totally baseless and russia is around 100x worse ( by the most optimistic measures ) . 
  you 're welcome . 
   the videos definitely dont show 143 millions people wich you dare to argue base on nothing wich is hilarious wouldnt even hold , they show * statistical data * . 
  * berlin , thousands of gays , 474 incidents per year . 
  * moscow , 2 gays , 20 incidents in one day . 
   your clunky explanation to disregard the jewish videos doesnt hold have n't seen a rebuttal . 
  therefore , it holds . 
   that you have 0 datas , as said , i use yours . 
  your own data is so bad that can be easily used against you . 
   you tried to pull in my that such events wont happen in european capitals in broad daylight never said that is does n't exist at all . 
  i said you can walk for a week and not see any of this . 
  source : gay friends have been walking/making out with their boyfriends for years without a single incident . 
   yeah bla bla bla ( completely delusionnal ) not delusional , it 's both intuitive and data-backed that crime spikes in unpopulated areas , at night and with the presence of alcohol . 
   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/gay-couple-thrown-off-london-bus-kissing nice example . 
  * a driver says `` yes , it 's my bus , it is my rules , and i do n't want to watch that . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  get off the bus '' * no insults , no physical contact . 
  * makes the news . 
  * driver can lose his job . 
  thanks for this great source to back my argument !, 
   http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/calgary-taxi-driver-suspended-for-kicking-out-gay-man-and-calling-him-disgusting-for-kissing another perfect example . 
  in calgary a taxi driver calls man `` disgusting '' and gets suspended . 
  in moscow you threaten to beat a couple of gays and no one even stops to look . 
  again , thanks for providing me more material !!, 
   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3071304/college-running-accused-beating-two-gay-men-kissing-street.html keep them coming . 
  college football player ( so , famous guy ) beats two gays .
