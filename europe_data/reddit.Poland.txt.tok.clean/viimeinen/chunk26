  the school condemns his behavior . 
  the athletic department threatens to expell him . 
  and the best of all  the fbi has been contacted and they are conducting an investigation . 
  yes . 
  the fucking fbi gets involved because someone punched a gay . 
  now compare to : [ russian police ignore anti-gay attacks ] ( http://mm.hrw.org/content/russian-police-ignore-anti-gay-attacks ) please post more links . 
  please !, 
   still that is what they record and those are datats , they might be lower or in the uk they might be higher wrong . 
  data from the uk is from the police , so ** all ** cases reported and centralized . 
  data from russia is from one ngo so it means that the real number is much much bigger ( how big ? 
  when the russian police stop ignoring reports we will know ) . 
  might be 50 % more , might be twice , might be 10x more . 
  who knows . 
   once case . 
  lol . 
  keep dreaming . 
  minute 1:25 first , minute 3:00 second . 
   first they were 0 in the first minute  they start walking at 0:40 . 
   0:50 : `` abusive words towards gay couple ''  0:53 * beep *  0:57 blue gay faggots  1:28 come over here you gay ( this is a threat , btw , so one battery , one assault right there )  1:45 bitches 1 minute of walking video , 5 cases of insults/assaults ( verbal violence ) , 1 battery . 
  i really do n't get what you are trying to prove . 
  there are clearly 2 cases of battery and multiple insults ( i do n't care if it 's 13 or 7 , 10 % or 5 % is equally outrageous ) in one video from one couple of gays walking in broad daylight on busy streets . 
  trying to suggest that berlin or london are anywhere near the hatred levels that russians feel for homosexuals is laughable . 
  btw , i do n't want to even imagine if they kissed ... or they walked at night ... or in small alleys . 
  that 's racist !, 
   do n't give them rights to marry and shit or better yet , do . 
  well , it 's not that 90 % of russians are lynching gays , it 's just 0.1 % . 
  but compared to the 0.001 % in the rest of the world ( 0.01 % in poland maybe ) , it 's a problem for russian gays ... 
  so as i understand it , for the total of immigrants it 's 2.6 children per woman and the total of the general population is 1.9 , right ? 
  a key detail is missing , * what is the the average for only french women * ? 
  that would tell you how much the immigrants are raising the average ... 
  yep , that is a good example and what i had in mind . 
  britain controlled the seas for centuries and germany created in 11 years a fleet that was able to rival them . 
  there are neo-nazi groups in poland as well . 
  do n't ask me ... 
  sorry , my bad !, 
  i guess the `` come over here you gay '' that followed was an invitation for a hug , then , 
   under   `` analysis , by sarah rainsford , bbc news , st petersburg ''   look again this is annoying . 
  ok , it says `` more ** than ** 300 '' . 
  that will not show up if you ctrl+f for `` more 300 '' or `` 347 '' . 
  now , read what it says :  ** one lgbt support group ** cited by human rights watch ** documented ** more than 300 homophobic attacks last year . 
  it does n't say that in the whole city there were only 300 attacks , it says that this one group only took written notes about 300 . 
  vastly different things . 
   the assault threat section are combine assault and threats are basically the same in the context of potential physical violence . 
  that 's why it 's combined . 
   , i dont know why you add it with insults . 
  that is not how it work furhtermore threath are `` violent crimes '' equal to assault ironically dude , i wrote it right after that . 
  seriously , read it , it 's right there , in bold . 
  hint : it 's because they are all forms of verbal offences ( as in `` no touching , just talking '' ) . 
   they were 0 threaths in this video . 
  well , there were two cases of battery instead . 
  good job !, 
   that is the thing they were not 20 insult far from that and far below . 
  let 's say that this number is not 20 , let 's say it 's 13 ( i counted 5 in the first minute of walking , should be about right ) . 
  this means that while walking through moscow ** for one day ** , ** one pair ** of gay guys received as much as 10 % of the total insults ** all the gays in berlin receive for a year ** ( 13/123 ) . 
  also , they received 1 % of all the ** physical ** molestation that ** all the gays in berlin accumulate over one year ** ( 2/200 ) . 
  what is someone was a german ** s ** uper ** s ** occer fan ? 
   and i told you how to do it are you seriously doing it on purpose ? 
  i did it . 
  zero results for `` more 300 '' . 
  zero results for `` 347 '' ( your original number ) . 
  i still do n't know where you came up with that number . 
   the maneo report shows that main offences in anti-gay acts of violence are insults ( 26 % ; 2011 : 30 % ) , actual and aggravated bodily harm ( 25 % ; 2011 : 21 % ) , and assaults and threats ( 26 % ; 2011 : 17 % )  obviously insult is only 26 % while the rest are physical arms . 
  yes , insults is 26 % and assault/threat another 26 % . 
  so ** a whopping 52 % of the 474 offences are just verbal ** . 
   i dont know where you get that 10 % i guesstimated the number of insults in the video ( for two people for one day ) to be around 20 . 
  i assumed the number of insults in berlin ( for all the gay population for a whole year ) would be around 200 ( real number 26 % of 474 is 123 ) . 
  it gave around 10 % . 
  i do n't want to count the insults in the video , but still assuming there are around 20 , it 's 16 % of the total insults that all the gay population of berlin receives in one year ... condensed in a video o holding hands while strolling through the city in the middle of the day . 
   yes because a trip to disneyland and 5 minutes of the bbc really gives you a feel of what life is like in the us , especially for minorities . 
  i 've never been to disneyland and i do n't watch the bbc . 
  i have spent some time in north carolina and maryland , tho . 
  and i have n't missed a single daily show or colbert report since 2009 , even after i came back to good ` ol yurop . 
   oh , how i enjoy talking to ignorant fools online . 
  i bet you do . 
   so your view of gays in the us , something like mad max meets saw ? 
  actually , you can read my opinion in the very comment that offended you so very much : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3t06/reaction_to_gays_in_russia_social_experiment/ct1oqjv hint : `` it 's less hostile than poland '' . 
  so much for reading comprehension ... 
   it is easy and beneficial for a couple to have children it 's ** easy ** everywhere , if you know what i mean ...  does really immigration has no impact ? 
  i though it was quite significative . 
  even to the point that the most common baby names in france were actually mohammed and fatima ... 
   actually yeah . 
  i guess i know as much about your grandmother as you do about life in the us . 
  oh , how i enjoy talking to ` muricans online ... thanks for the entertainment  yes , your country is the most secretive state in the world , it is impossible to get in , visit , work or simply watch the news . 
   so they were violent yes . 
  insulting is violence . 
  is not a crime . 
   i already put the link just do ctrl+f `` more 300 '' zero results . 
  but thanks for the tip . 
   i tend to trust `` human rights numbers '' human rights groups denounce that even police ignore homophobic violence . 
  still , zero verifiable numbers . 
   every day , lgbt people are insulted or even physically at - tacked and harmed -- even in berlin . 
  a total of 474 new incidents and tip-offs were reported to maneo in 2012 474 cases ** including insults ** in a whole year in a whole city . 
  you can see at least 10 % of that in the video alone . 
   q : just to play devil 's avocado : what would the reaction be to running water and electricity poland ? 
   a : that 's a fair question ... 
  it is . 
  my great grandma got running water and electricity during my lifetime , so i witnessed her reaction . 
  she loved it . 
  i do n't see your point . 
  was that supposed to be somehow bad ?
