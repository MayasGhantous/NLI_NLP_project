  am i supposed to be offended ? 
  by something which is provably true ? 
  come on , mallorca is not that small ... 
   no you 've demonstrated your ignorance and arrogance . 
  well , nope . 
  not yet at least . 
  but i could be arrogant if you want . 
  here 's your comma : , ( you seem to have dropped it ) . 
  see ? 
   and there was nothing innocent or curious about his loaded question . 
  yell for help . 
  paranoid much ? 
   are you angry because people are n't as naive as you ? 
  very much . 
  raging , in fact . 
   wtf is that supposed to be ? 
  btw you know two things about us , jack and shit . 
  i might know more than you ...  let me tell you about your country ... do tell . 
  just tell me what is `` my country '' first , cause i have lived in a few over the years ... oh , and my language if you so please ( i used yours to talk about the us ) :d, 
   and it 's far from a given that they 'd ever want to make the investment in their military that would be necessary for it to rival france 's . 
  oh they absolutely do n't . 
  it was just a end-of-nato-what-if . 
   but 1073 homophobic crimes offences . 
  not crimes . 
  very different . 
   while in st petersburg they are only 300 homophobic crimes . 
  i still have n't seen the source . 
  your source did not contain those numbers . 
  and in the uk , [ the police does not ignore homophobic attacks ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30477728 ) , making the numbers much more trustworthy ( as in `` not meaningless '' ) . 
  i have seen 2 assaults in the moscow video alone . 
  actually it was worse than [ assault ] ( http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/assault ) , it was [ battery ] ( http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/battery ) . 
   in berlin -- one of the most tolerant cities in the world , at least for gay men -- the percentages are higher . 
  out of 2,150 respondents , 43 percent reported hate crimes , up from 39 percent in 2006  wich mean 1225 alone for berlin a city of 3 millions people . . 
  sorry , that is not how polls work . 
  also , source . 
  edit : include link definitions for assault and battery, 
  there is also more to pr that just oratory . 
  who even said it 's just oratory ? 
  holy sensibility batman . 
  have we offended your feelings by validating an innocent a out-of-curiosity question ? 
  does it bother you that a * fureinner * can have knowledge about your country ? 
  expensive : germany has the money to do it ( i assume , since we agreed that france is less economically powerful than germany and has one ) . 
  it 's no manhattan project , just a big engineering project . 
  infrastructure : i hope we can handwave germany 's general industrial power . 
  about shipbuilding in particular : [ check the wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:shipbuilding_companies_of_germany ) . 
  i think they would n't need * extensive * modifications for a carrier . 
  escort : germany has a [ * decent * fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_german_navy_ships ) already and the capability of making more if needed . 
  as i said , i 'm no naval engineer , but i do n't see any major technical obstacles for germany to build a carrier/fleet . 
   ok so lets do some facts check ok , let 's ...  i dont know according to the guardian they are around 1000 per year in london alone in 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/rise-violent-homophobic-crimes-reported-police  hundreds of assaults on gay and lesbian people have been reported to police so far in 2014 -- including ** more than 300 in london alone ** . 
  ok , so not 1000 , but 300 . 
  let 's adjust to 360 for the whole year . 
   while lgbt association record around 347 in st ptersbourg i do n't see that figure in the link , ( seems awefully low , my guess would be under-reporting ) but ok ...  stpetersburg : 5.8 m people  london : 13.8 m people so st petersburg , ( according to other redditor in this post , the most progressive city in russia ) has 1 attack per 16,700 people , london 1 per 39,000 people , almost 3 times less . 
  nice fact checking , let 's do it again some time ... 
   self-sufficient on every possible needed drug and medical equipment , no . 
  well , it 's not self sufficient then . 
  nobody doubts ( well , i 'm sure someone would ) that greece will be able to manufacture aspirin or paracetamol , but what about cancer treatment ? 
  hiv drugs ? 
  those are very non-trivial ( and expensive ) and they are in high demand . 
   poor cuba has been isolated and embargo-ed for 60 fucking years and they have superior health care than the us that could be interpreted two ways : * have better healthcare coverage than the us : well ... who does n't ? 
  * have better healthcare advancements the us : as a general rule , false . 
  they are `` not far behind '' in some areas and `` on par with '' on others , even a few pioneering discoveries . 
  but they are `` far behind due to lack of resouces '' on many more ( sometimes even x-rays are hard to get ) . 
  source : reddit askscience thread about cuban cancer vaccine last month . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  * attacks are so rare that when one happens it makes the news . 
  * also i talked about ** in the city center ** in * broad daylight * against ** random pair of homosexuals ** . 
  not at night during party/drunk time or against gay symbols . 
  the russian video ... not in the city center ? 
  well , sure * you do n't see the kremlin in the background * but it 's clearly a normal busy residential area , not a ghetto . 
  besides : what about the second one ( which is much more violent/confrontational ) ? 
  i agree with the nuclear arsenal , but a blue water navy not so much . 
  germany already developed a blue water navy to be reckoned with 100 years ago in a very short time . 
  it 's not so different from the current navy they have , just needs scaling . 
   e : lolo historic disputes warrant acting like savages towards innocents . 
  til . 
  no , do not * warrant * , but do explain . 
  and , no , not * acting like savages * . 
  let me list the contents of the jew video :  0:13 walking starts i do n't see anything offensive here ...  0:16 arab guys says `` are you all right ? 
  are you jewish ? '', 
  he seems totally non-threatening , more amused than anything . 
   0:27 some dudes say `` i 'm joking , the dog will not eat you '' not a single reference to him being jew , just thugs being thugs . 
   0:40 some dudes say `` dude , he came here to fuck from the front and back '' sure , seems offensive , although i do n't understand it . 
   0:46 stalker says `` jew ''  0:52 stalker stalks creepy stalker is creepy . 
   0:58 arab girl spits after crossing him spitting is bad taste , i guess . 
   1:02 arab guys look at him what is wrong here ? 
  that they turn their heads ? 
   1:08 african girl yells `` viva palestine '' this is laughable . 
  the fact that you 'd consider someone supporting palestine as any kind of `` bullying '' ( the author seems to think so ) is deeply disturbing . 
   1:12 arab girls giggle and say something ( `` jew '' ? ), 
  giggling girls sure are dangerous ...  1:20 guys say `` homo '' and spit after he passes yep , offensive and in bad taste  1:25 walking ends could you please indicate where exactly is the `` acting like savages '' ? 
  or `` institutionalized antisemitism '' ? 
  i count 4 people calling him `` a jew '' ( discrimination , i guess ? 
  ) , two insults ( `` homo '' , fuck something something ) and two spits . 
  all by arab immigrants . 
  the most alarming thing is the stalker . 
  plus three incidents that do n't seem wrong at all ( guy asking `` are you jewish ? 
  '' , dudes with dog , girl yelling ) . 
   with two of them outside the city center ( and one walking in the middle whatever on purpose ) outside the city center . 
  one is at 1:25 , the second is at 3:00 . 
  both seem nice streets , some people around ( especially the second one ) .
