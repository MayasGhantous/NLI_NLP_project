  definitely not ghetto-vibe . 
  even then it would not be excusable . 
   this videos is far from being representative au contraire . 
  the fact that there * was * an attack tells * everything * . 
  let alone two . 
  those guys could walk for a week around ( madrid , paris , amsterdam , brussels , berlin , vienna , rome , zurich , copenhagen , oslo , stockholm ) and no one would dare touch them . 
  hell , they could probably sit on a bench in a park and make out for 10 hours and people would n't give a shit . 
  let me copy & paste [ my comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3t06/reaction_to_gays_in_russia_social_experiment/ct1tc6a ) here : not even the same league . 
  that dude walked all around paris , including some shady-looking neighborhoods and got 1 minute and something of video of people calling him `` a jew '' ( ?!, 
  ) , some girl yelling `` viva palestine '' and some insults . 
  and iirc it was all/almost all muslim immigrants , who have serious historic disputes with jews/israel ( see the `` palestine '' girl ) . 
  this video shows two physical attacks in the middle of crowded streets in broad daylight . 
   i 've got the sneaking suspicion that a lot of people who dismissed the `` walking as a jew in paris '' video are now pointing to this video and saying `` see !, 
  russia so backwards . '', 
  not even the same league .

   we do n't even know the polish in any other way then that . 
  your cars seem to know us quite well , tho . 
  i do n't have it ( hence the question ) . 
  i just read it `` somewhere '' ( reddit ? 
  newspaper ? ), 
  and i wanted a confirmation/rebuttal , maybe with official data, 
  i 'm not 100 % sure it would , i 'm just worried it could . 
  if they crossed some of our famous `` pseudokibice '' ( mix of neo-nazis with hooligans , for those non familiar with poland ) then it could be even worse than on the video . 
   [ and here ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/ausland/crop102065189/9019736783-ci3x2l-w540/mcz-hitler-bm-bayern-warschau.jpg ) well , greece might be off the hook for that one . 
  that is all true assuming : * germany and france will keep their current immigration patterns ( responsible for a big part of the demographic trend ) : france accepting lots of `` fertile '' africans , germany accepting more `` moderate '' easter europeans/turks . 
  * germany and france keep their current military attitudes : france trying to remain a * world * power ( nukes and carriers ) and germany being shy , lest it be accused of hitlering around . 
  none of which is a given . 
  france has already had a few cultural/racial clashes and many people call for reducing immigration . 
  germany realizes the demographic decline and they might start acting about it ( took sweden less than a decade to go from least births/woman to leading the pack , it 's not impossible to turn the tide ) . 
  the military is based on will , technology and money . 
  france has all three but is slowly getting short on money ( would like to use it elsewhere ) . 
  germany does have the technology and money , they just * do n't want * to use it in that direction . 
  `` yet '' . 
   germany was doing badly until around 2006 which is , quite interestingly , due to the austerity measures they forced on themselves at that time . 
  thanks to which , they pulled through much better after the crisis , having a `` leaner '' and more efficient economy . 
  * w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk !, 
   \u0391ctually , greece is self-sufficient in both food and medical care . 
  any source on this ? 
  afaik not even the usa is self-sufficient on * medical care * ( they have to import drugs for lethal injections , for instance ) . 
  yeah , they * could * manufacture it ( probably ) , but international law prevents them from doing it . 
  is n't that basically all of what a politician must be/do ? 
  they have experts/counsellors on everything . 
  i might have misinterpreted you , but ... are you suggesting that only immigrants have this attitudes ? 
  because one of the worst offenders @ 1:25 looks pretty white to me ... 
  it might be worse than that . 
  they might have suggested to do it * out of the bed * !, 
  sure , there are morons in any minority . 
  but the point is , what the gay community as a whole is asking , is basically `` leave us be '' / `` do n't discriminate us '' . 
   i expected sth like in poland ( people looking the other way , or shouting obscenities ) , not this . 
  call me a pessimist , but if i saw exactly this in warsaw instead of moscow , i 'd be disappointed . 
  not surprised , just disappointed . 
  i know just too many people with the opinion of '' * i 'm not a homophobe , but they should forbid gays from kissing in public , it 's disgusting * '' . 
  not hooligans , `` normal people '' , old and young , friends and even family members :(, 
  well , unless they hired two guys to `` bump '' into them , this video is crossing the line . 
  it shows ** physical violence ** , in a ** city center ** , in broad ** daylight ** against two people ** for holding hands ** . 
  it 's a fair question . 
  i guess that you would maybe hear some slurs but never ever see any physical violence . 
  especially not in the center of a big city in broad daylight . 
  ps : i 'm actually more worried about what would happen in warsaw or cracow than in atlanta or dallas, 
  give them time ... 
  interesting read . 
  although there is an accounting trick in this . 
  i was curious how on earth can france `` produce '' 80 % of * primary * energy as nuclear , since france has no uranium deposits ...  france does not mine uranium for the front end of the fuel cycle domestically , french companies have various holdings in the uranium market . 
  uranium for the french program totals 10,500 tonnes per year coming from various locations such as :  * canada -- 4500 tu/yr  * niger -- 3200 tu/yr source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_in_france#fuel_cycle so it 's more about what european companies control more than what europe internally can produce per se . 
  [ which is not wothout riks ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renationalization_of_ypf ), 
   greece has been running a current account surplus since the second half of 2013 . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but did n't syriza discover that those numbers were fake and the first surplus is expected for 2015 ? 
   wikipedia list germany defaulting in 1948 sourcing this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_defaults#cite_note-forgotten-debt-1[1] this cite is exactly what i quoted in my comment . 
  please read what you reply to ...  the debt of greece was not used on their economy , btw it mostly come from transferring debt from the private sector to the public . 
  false . 
  greece accumulated the debt for 30 years and it was used in their economy . 
  where else would the money go ? 
  debt is not magically created , it 's the accumulation of unpaid loans ...  but anyway , if we were able to forgive germany ( and it 's debt ) for the greater purpose , we should do it for greece too . 
  back then germany 's creditors had much more to win for themselves than greece creditors have now . 
  incidentally , the same applies to 2008 , back then creditors were much more motivated to rescue greece than now , as their own economies were at stake . 
  people are generally selfish ... 
   europe imports about 50 % of its energy , not `` almost all '' . 
  i 'm going to need a source on that ... 
  that might still be a problem for the 1.4 m people that already live in munich ( and the 5.8 m metro area with basically identical cost of living ) . 
  i do n't see any info on a default in 1948 other than the source of the wiki article of list of defaults . 
  the source says :  monetary reform limiting 40 deutschemark per person . 
  partial cancellation and blocking of all accounts . 
  really not a lot to go on ... 
  the other articles do n't even mention 1948 : - / -- now , about the agreements of 1953 the situation is * quite * different : * half of germany 's negotiated `` debt '' was in the form of war reparations from the ** first ** world war . 
  not money that germany borrowed and had used for their economy but arbitrary numbers that were imposed on them by the entente in 1918 . 
  * west germany was a border state with the warsaw pact countries and the korean war was in full force at the time . 
  it was in the interest of all nato countries to have a strong germany . 
  nobody wrote off debts out of * solidarity * or * fraternity * , it was simple self-preservation . 
  i will gladly read any analysis that would say otherwise ... 
   i am kind of ashamed at my country is n't that the most popular german national pasttime ? 
   an external fund ** like ** the institution for growth key word, 
  shut up now !, 
  you and your stupid reality are ruining a great headline !, 
  a quick wiki search says that 's true , although i was worried about the quality : * german tanks ( 232 ) are all leopard 2a6 + * polish tanks include 247 leopard 2a4/5 and 750 t72-class . 
  actually i 'm surprised , i did n't know poland had such a decent army . 
  ^ ( * time for surprise anschluss !,
