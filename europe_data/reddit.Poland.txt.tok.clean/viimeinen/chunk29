   the germans got expulsed out of the cities they lived in ( danzig is a pretty extreme example that went from a city that used to have a mostly german population to only polish population by now ) actually danzig is the least extreme example . 
  danzig/gda \u0144sk was a free city administered by poland pre-war , now it 's just a polish city . 
  others like szczecin/stettin , wroc\u0142aw / breslau and many others were just german cities pre-war and are just polish cities now . 
  poland was basically moved 200km west after wwii , losing territory to the soviet union and gaining from germany . 
  su won the war , germany lost it . 
  for poland ... it was a tie ? 
  i do n't know the numbers , but ** which ** tanks and ** which ** artillery also counts a lot . 
  ok , i definitely need more coffee ... 
  well if you have to ask , i will just show myself out :( before anyone gets offended or something , joke explanation : [ shots fired meme ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shots-fired ) + the fact that [ germany uses broomsticks instead of guns ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/ ) making it hard to fire those shots . 
  inb4 this kills the joke . 
   had he sent their broomsticks to athens maybe . . 
  shots fired . 
  ^ ( well , actually about those shots ... ), 
  estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia ... 
  which , imho is better than the fixed german model . 
  if it was per land ( state ) it * could * be ok , but a national limit makes no sense . 
  what is barely enough to get by in munich , gets you a pretty cushy life in berlin . 
  that is quite an awesome summary of the situation , like when barney summed up himym in 1 minute . 
  ps : not everyone from poland is so grumpy . 
  also , remember the plumber !, 
  hey swede , enjoy your kroner and your popcorn and stay out of this :p * hands over some polish popcorn *, 
  is n't it the case with greece too ? 
  [ honest question , idk ] in any case it certainly was the case for decades ( 80s , 90s minimum ) , when greece not only got the transfers but also built up a huge debt that exploded in 2008 . 
  ps : invest in eastern poland !, 
  germany already proposed `` selling islands '' as a possible debt reduction step . 
  that did not end well . 
  source ? 
  i 'm from poland and i lived in spain in the 90s and 2000s . 
  can confirm . 
  spain was built with cohesion funds , poland is being built right now . 
  this is a very na\u00efve way of seeing it . 
  as europe imports almost all of its energy and you need energy to produce and transport anything , a euro devaluation would in fact mean that ** everything ** gets more expensive . 
  edit : s/it 's / its /, 
   but many greeks also feel that there is a big responsability on how the creditors handled the crisis . 
  the thing is , many other countries applied the same/similar austerity measures ( pre-crisis , even ) and while painful , they seemed to work and put those countries on the way to recovery . 
   even syriza ** made a 360 turn ** and axcepted everything they asked of them is the math education budget also cut ? 
   come on man , this is greece , not germany . 
  we already pay enough . 
  are we on / r/nottheonion ? 
  actually this should be in / r/notbildzeitung . 
  i think either you or me are wrong about what `` stereotype '' means . 
  so , the answer is `` yes '' , right ? 
   how about the financial risk of the esm ? 
  is it actually possible to ` force ' expenses/risk onto the 15 % even if they disagree ? 
  the point is : you have to transfer the money to greece by tuesday . 
  sure , greece will pay you back * over the next 30 years , but for now kiss the money goodbye . 
  ^ * maybe, 
  because of the `` girls with gay guy friend '' stereotype ? 
   i said we did so under the guise of helping greece . 
  we * also * helped greece . 
  i 'm no economist but i can hardly imagine greece would be better off having defaulted in 2008 than having a bailout . 
  so we did help greece but we did n't `` only help greece '' . 
  i never understood it as `` are n't we sweet that we are helping greece out of the greatness of our hearts '' . 
  i think the news at the time were more along the lines of `` holy cow the eu is in deep shit we are * all * going to die if we do n't bail out greece now and let 's prepare money for portugal and ireland '' . 
   how much of a hit from greek bonds . 
  we will probably never know , as i was all tied together . 
   they did take some , but particularly when taking into account how much they profited from them it was nothing . 
  how much did they profit ? 
  so afaiu most of your post is `` not * necessarily * true '' ( correct me if i overlooked something ) to which i agree , but i 'd argue that `` not * necessarily * true , but ... more probable than not , given the panic circumstances '' . 
   sure . 
  lets just be honest that we were helping the creditors . 
  we mutualised their debt . 
  and lets all bitch about helping irresponsible french and german banks . 
  well , we were `` helping ourselves by helping the creditors '' . 
  and we * should * bitch about the banks , just not suddenly assign them 100 % of the blame , what some people want to do . 
  i myself was * very * critical about the bank bailout in spain , where banks received tens of billions of euros in european loans guaranteed by the government while they sit on ( depending on sources ) up to 1 million empty housing units waiting for the real estate market to pick up . 
  but i 'm rambling , so let 's get back to topic . 
   how much of a hit did they take so far ? 
  how many agencies did they have to close ? 
  did they cut salaries ? 
  did they cut all bonuses ? 
  well , just look at the stock market 2007 -  now . 
  * commerzbank 220 -  11 * deutsche bank 90  28 * bnp paribas 90 -  54 * credit agricole 30 -  13.6 * santander 14 -  6.5 * bbva 18 -  9 * ing 45 -  17 rest assured that they got hurt by the whole ordeal , we are 8 years after and most banks are nowhere near their stock market levels pre-crisis . 
  about bonuses and other stuff : data is not so easy to collect . 
  most banks i heard about closed around 50 % of branch offices . 
  bonuses usually depend on stock market performance so they might have been hit , but who knows ... 
  does n't the emu treaty include that a country must be part of the eu to participate ? 
  well , the eu is not a federal union/state ... edit : what is the us federal budget / us gdp ? 
  thanks , til, 
  according to this : https://i.imgur.com/ixs448g.png greece started borrowing `` too much '' around 1980 . 
  which makes sense , you do n't get to the clusterfuck situation of 2010 in just a few years , you need decades of mismanagement to get there ( although nobody says you ca n't enjoy the mismanagement while it lasts ) . 
  if the data is wrong i 'd love for someone to correct me . 
  well , not only in france ... [ germany : muslims angered at insinuation that muslims are easily angered ] ( http://www.examiner.com/article/german-muslims-angered-at-insinuation-that-muslims-are-easily-angered ), 
  you do realize that most brics are in terrible shape themselves , arguably worse than most eu countries ? 
  * russia faces sanctions ( annoying to them , but kind of meh ) , falling oil prices ( devastating ) and a devaluating currency ( not end-of-the-world but has halved their foreign currency reserves and elevated interest types to levels * very * uncomforable for the general population ) * china has been underperforming for several years now . 
  latest news about stock market , while not tragic , add to the worries . 
  * brazil was doing great until 2012 , but is expected to actually * contract * in 2015 . 
  * i have no data about india and sa from the top of my head , but i remember hearing that sa also has big problems but india is doing fine lately . 
  afair , tsipras already met with putin and the result was `` you have all our support , but none of out money '' . 
  look at the numbers , the brics-bank has 100bn usd fund . 
  the eu had 726bn eur ( ~ 800bn usd ) fund and that is in addition to whatever the imf provides . 
  and the greek debt is ~ 380bn usd . 
  the numbers just do n't add up , it was a pure political move to offer that to greece . 
   not discussing this part means not answering my comment at all . 
  first of all , holy hyperbole , batman . 
  i explained exactly how greece ended up `` owing finland '' , so `` not answering at all '' does not apply here . 
  now , i do n't have the numbers but i imagine letting greece default to private banks would be ugly for every one ( arguably uglier than now ) . 
  * greece would have defaulted ( duh ) . 
  this means no access to more credits for a long time , starting at time of * very * delicate global economy . 
  general chaos and tears in greece , 1929 style .
