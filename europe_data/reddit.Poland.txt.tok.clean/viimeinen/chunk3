  ca n't refuse arguments -  complain about `` whineing '' ( and hope it goes unnoticed ) . 
  well , tough luck . 
   i 'm not going anywhere at least for now \\ o /  but i 'm kinda loosing hope that you 'd be able to bring anything else but these slogans i understand that facts are uncomfortable . 
  it must suck seeing progress all over the world . 
   you 're wasting my time . 
   wow , you actually wrote such a long a comment with no apparent content . 
  that 's some acheivement . 
  oh , you totally ran out of arguments and ca n't admit defeat ? 
   please , let me know when you will grow up . 
  oh , i missed the ad-hominem ... classic !, 
  please do n't go !, 
  i was having so much fun ... who will spout homophobic arguments now ? 
   i 'm not putting words in your mouth , yes , you are . 
  after reading what i wrote . 
  and addressing it . 
  so no excuses . 
   so , do you finally see how ridiculous is that martyrology ? 
  or do i have to use the label of s/arcasm to make it easier for you ? 
  sure , '' * it was a prank , bro * '' . 
  i believe you !, 
  ^ ^ / s  dude , you are making drama do you really love ad-hominem that much ? 
  ca n't defend you position without it ? 
   guess that should be labelled as `` hate speech '' as well and censored never !!!, 
  i am actually saving your comments in case you delete them , just to show people in the future `` look what homophobes said back in 2015 '' . 
  no cesnorship , ever !!, 
  keep embarrassing yourself , i will keep saving it . 
   i 'm a `` homophobe '' after all well , the first step is admitting it !, 
  * < rainbow confetti  *  just a class enemy that is going to die with no replacement , fortunately !, 
   you whine too much ad-hominem . 
  ca n't refute , complain about drama and whining . 
   also about that `` ad hominem '' but just to give you a reason , i 'm calling you a hypocrite . 
  calling names , no reasoning . 
  exhibit a !, 
   and present has many examples how these people , after getting equal civic rights , are promoted and supported since they 're still disadvantaged , at least according to the far left ??? 
  `` there are exemples '' -  gives no examples . 
  cool story , bro !, 
   one more thing from history is that poland was the only country that never criminalised homosexuality , noble women could inherit properties and they could even vote if they were paying taxes . 
  that , together with religious tolerance , was already here since ages . 
  and here comes pis to ruin it . 
  an even bigger shame in perspective , really . 
   `` midgets of reaction '' ... really , the time goes by and the lefty hatred is not changing a bit , such hatred , wanting equalitiy !, 
  how dare they !, 
  * angry fist shaking *  but fortunatelly it 's only a narrow extreme today ??? 
   if that makes you feel better , keep dreaming mlk says hi   but it would be better to calm down and face the reality oh , i do . 
  the reality is this map is getting bluer every day : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg and i love it !, 
   were n't we talking about the demographics of conservative electorate already ? 
  yep , mostly mohairs and rednecks . 
  both on decline !, 
   no , you never answered to the point i 'm making all the time , that you wants to privillage just another people , while to keep `` abusing '' the others . 
  i guess you do n't get the fact that there 're other people than just homo and heterosexual couples . 
  i mentioned four times already : stop putting words in my mouth . 
  i do * not * want to extend the privilege to `` another group of people '' . 
  and you read it , since you answered your famous `` why not let children get married '' . 
   obviously that was about `` inequality '' since you exclude these people from benefits . 
  indeed , it 's funny how you wants to ... `` discriminate '' them . 
  not letting children get married is discrimination !, 
  please keep writing stuff !, 
  i 'm saving all these comments to show people in the future * exactly * how fucked up is poland . 
  please , keep writing . 
   seriously ? 
  what 's the point of repeating the same thing which i 've answered for already ? 
  so i have more examples to convince people what is the mindset of polish conservatives . 
  they will think it 's a misunderstanding so the more you write the clearer the image is . 
   you 're really a drama queen and you keep using that word that you do n't know what it means in a ridiculous ad-hominem attempt . 
  i 'd like some more variety , but this is fine too . 
   you did n't get the point i did get * exactly * to the point !, 
  that is why you try to deflect the attention and not refute my argument . 
  a bit transparent , but c for effort . 
   changed the subject for some absurdal theories those are absurd . 
  and outdated . 
  and wrong . 
  just like homophobia , but you keep insisting on it , so i just add some more . 
  in 30 years most homophobic people will be dead and the world will be a better place . 
   keep whineing about the strawman . 
  if you start using correct arguments i 'll do n't have what to protest about . 
  unfortunately , it 's impossible to defend homophobia with logical arguments so one has to resort to strawman arguments , ad-hominem and claims of child marriage . 
  very entertaining , tho !, 
   is that a promise , comrade ? 
  that 's what history says . 
  wrong ideas die with old people , new generations are more tolerant and progressive . 
  which is awesome !, 
   just face the facts , polish society is conservative and the `` progressive '' brainwashing is not working again , history has many examples . 
  slavers were conservative and `` liberation '' brainwashing did n't work . 
  anti-suffrage people were conservative and `` women 's rights '' brainwashing did n't work . 
  racists were conservative and `` racial equality '' brainwashing did n't work . 
  but they all died out and now there are no more slaves , women can vote and black people do n't have to sit in the back of the bus . 
  fortunately , soon everyone ( adult , consenting ) will be able to marry as well . 
  and in a few years homophobes will be nothing more than a `` black chapter '' in history . 
   we have a new president and soon there 'll be a new gov while the lefty radicals will be out of parliament . 
  well , it 's a minor setback , but understandable when 2 million of the brightest people have left the country and the homophobes and `` mohair berets '' are still there . 
  not long fortunately !, 
   instead of making up stuff and accusations why do n't you just answer ? 
  i answer everything point by point . 
   that 's no contradiction you seem to have a problem knowing what a contradiction is . 
  here , let me help you : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contradiction  i think that just the minors should be protected sure ... '' * why just two and * *** why adults **** ? 
  * '' yep , i believe you . 
   you are making a ** drama ** [ you keep using that word , i do not think it means what you think it means ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drama )  something that exists only in this martyrologic propaganda keep denying reality . 
  [ maybe the 4th time is the charm ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom )  these are not any `` facts '' [ just one more for good measure . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom )  just becouse someone is not granted the privillages that the others can enjoy is not `` abused '' yet .
