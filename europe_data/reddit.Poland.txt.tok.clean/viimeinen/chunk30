  * many banks that were owed would go bankrupt . 
  * the countries those banks were in would have to pay up 100,000 $ to every customer of those banks . 
  not a loan , 100 % gone money . 
  * customers with more than 100,000 $ would lose that money . 
  do n't think of a guy hairy guy sitting on a yacht , keep in mind many of those people would be retirees that lost a big part of their live savings . 
  * if many banks went bankrupt more banks and bigger banks would follow suit . 
  look what happened in 2008 in the whole world when just one bank went down ( lehman brothers ) , imagine if a few months later deutsche bank , bnp paribas and/or santander went down . 
  * banksters would lose * hundreds of thousands * in salary ... or they would get * millions * in severance ( as happened in many failed smaller spanish banks ) . 
  if you are trying to argue that the bailout only served to rescue the evil banksters , i think it 's not just an oversimplification , it 's just not true . 
  evil banksters , being evil , will find a way out making a profit . 
  is n't it that if a country leaves the eu ( which afaik there is a way to do ) they automatically leave the emu ? 
   maybe finns should ask their government how did greece end up `` owing finland '' ? 
  how the bailout terms were that countries would loan money to greece * in exchange for greece getting their act together . 
  some people though it would work some people thought it would n't . 
  it was done in many countries and in all of them it seems to have worked except greece . 
  \\* the loans would be used to pay off loans ( among others ) to private banks , yes . 
  we could discuss about this as well , it 's not as black and white and some want to put it . 
  afaiu the main arguments are political , not economical : it would put in question the eu/euro as a one way project . 
   if that is not possible then there are other options . 
  namely ? 
  exactly . 
  so the creditors are very careful of what they do with greece not because it has a lot of economic impact on it 's own ( it has n't ) , but because if other bigger countries ( spain and italy mainly ) see that you can get debt written off they will try the same and * that * it will be a fucking blood bath . 
   the debt/gdp ratio of greece was pretty reasonable until she joined the eurozone . 
  it started going haywire in 2003-2004 ( stupid olympic games ) and reached a relatively high level of ~ 100 % in 2008 ( not the highest in europe , but close enough . ), 
  yeah , i 'm gon na go ahead call bullshit on that . 
  https://i.imgur.com/ixs448g.png  the eurozone has become a power play by germany oh yes , the good old `` germany is the devil '' song . 
  https://i.imgur.com/jqqz3nh.png the facts are : * greece had a huge debt expansion pre-euro ( 4x , from 25 % to 100 % gdp ) * greece had a moderate debt expansion post-euro ( from 100 % gdp to 180 % ) conclusion ( apparently ) : ** the euro ** ruined greece . 
  and regarding austerity : * austerity worked in ireland * austerity worked in portugal * austerity worked in spain * austerity worked in latvia * austerity worked in lithuania * austerity worked in germany * austerity did not work in greece conclusion ( apparently ) : austerity ruins countries and is just short of genocide . 
  everyone should have given greece ** even more ** money ( cause they have proven for 20 years how well they manage it ) and that will fix the problem . 
  sigh ... 
  or the several other countries where austerity led to two years of shrinking followed by 3 years of record growth ... or the debt/gdp ratio of 1990-2010 where greece had no austerity ( hint : they went bankrupt ) . 
  a fuckton of spaniards too , if you trust the comments on spanish online media ( podemos supporters mainly , but still ) . 
  to be honest , when germany decides to invade other countries for bullshit reasons , their reputation takes a bigger hit , 
   so americans are to european film like the germans and soviets are to american film ? 
  not really . 
  americans are to european film like americans are to team america film , 
   oh , and dont you ever dare defend the german practices when it comes to swastikas or videogames . 
  if someone criticises german ** practices ** he is not * bashing germany * . 
  i live in germany and love it here , but i agree that regarding nuclear power or videogames , large sectors of the public have given up to fear . 
   the ~ ~ fact ~ ~ * opinion * that the more you squeeze the greek economy now the less of the debt you 'll manage to reclaim in the future . 
  ftfy, 
  wtf is with the sheep on the klo ? 
  *** what kind of islamic fundamentalist censored version of bild is this ? 
  the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a ~ ~ gun ~ ~ zip tie . 
  want coffee ? 
  well , you might be right , but i do n't see how that is relevant . 
  first , the deficit thing is not a sure thing , i 've read opinions on both sides . 
  either they fixed the deficit and as of 2014 and they are running in fact a small surplus or they are ( were ) still cooking the books , syriza uncovered it and in 2014 they were still in a small deficit . 
  no idea which one is correct . 
  ( talking of course about pre-loan-payment numbers ) . 
  the point is : it does n't matter . 
  sure , the new bailout money wo n't * go to the people * , as it would serve pay for the old loans . 
  loans that cover other loans that cover other loans that cover loans that * already went to the people * 8 or 10 years ago . 
  so if i understand this correctly , greece took loans , used them to pay pensions and run the country and whatnot . 
  when they had to pay the loans back they could n't ( cause they were running a deficit ) , so they took a bailout ( new loans ) . 
  now those second loans are due , they complain that `` the money from these loans are not getting to the people '' . 
  so the money is actually going to greece ... 
   none of that fucking money actually goes to greece if none of that money goes to greece , how come they are unable to pay pensions and govt salaries without it ? 
  seems like a long rant full of edgy bullshit to me . 
  nope , no money for that ... 
  in polish , `` no '' actually means yes ... 
  context ? 
   think that farage is ** to ** big of a joke * too, 
  nah , it 's just that [ there is a comment almost exactly the same as yours but 7 min prior ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cjvgi/juncker_confiscates_farages_oxi_banner_in_the/cswb6xy ) , so i guess the downvotes are `` joke re-post '' . 
  the first one has +47 at the moment . 
  no he was n't . 
  it was actually his not-being-really-good-at-painting that eventually made him famous . 
   no , it 's the prime rule for every person that is working as a firefighter , a police officer or anyone helping people : you only help , if you are n't endangering yourself . 
  because if you do , the next person arriving at the scene will have to deal with two people screaming for help . 
  this is a bullshit argument . 
  germany ( or nl , or finland ) are not endangering themselves at all . 
  germany lent greece some 50 billion euro . 
  a lot of money ? 
  sure . 
  it is also equal to the * profit * of the top 10 german companies ( not the income , just the profit ) . 
  or the fortune of the two ( ! ), 
  richest germans . 
  yes , it is a lot of money but is not putting germany in any `` mortal danger '' . 
  as i said , bullshit argument . 
   how so ? 
  isis is active in europe . 
  yes , they are going to assault berlin any day now , following stalin 's footsteps . 
   but is egypt better off ? 
  it 's also torn apart and also muslimic . 
  their military will probably wander off like iraq 's military did . 
  you should really read up on egypt . 
  useless to discuss about it when you have the notion that egypt is anywhere near post-war iraq or mid-civil-war syria . 
  they have 500.000 active personnel ( highly laic , anti-extremist and united ) and 1.000.000 more in the reserve . 
  a relatively modern air force : 220 f16 alone , supported by mirages , c130 and apache helicopters , even awacs and drones . 
  more than 1.000 modern abrahms tanks ( and close to 2.000 heavy soviet tanks ) . 
  artillery , comm systems , navy , etc. 
  oh , and the support of the us , russia and china . 
  and on top of that isis has no border with egypt to attack from . 
   that is true but to my knowledge pesh are experienced fighters . 
  i like to think that that 's mostly the reason isis is losing to them what * wars * have they fought in ? 
  egypt has been at war with israel every few years in the 20th century . 
  yes , they lost most of them ( never successfully occupied israel ) but never ran away . 
  the peshmerga have done some guerrilla activity but this is the first all-out war they fight in . 
  the peshmerga have a maximum 200.000 soldiers , some 170 medium size and outdated soviet tanks and 4 helicopters , which are not even armed , just for transport . 
  their main weapon is infantry and toyotas with machine guns or aa guns on the backs , and they are holding back isis along a huge border just fine .
