  i do n't even understand why would you bring that up . 
  not counting on a country in times of hardship has nothing to do with trading and cooperation with them in economic matters . 
  nato is where it 's at , and poland joined for partnership with the us , who has proven time and again that has their allies ' backs . 
   quite a few other countries speak english , many governments have been shaped by our empire , many cultures too . 
  i 'm not saying that 's a good thing , but it 's what global influence gets you , i 'm not sure why you see the us being big as some sort of insult to the uk . 
  i 'm not . 
  are you ? 
   their independence was actually before the height of the british empire and they became our closest ally . 
  anyway , you have managed to join in a union that is apparently run mainly by old enemies of poland and traitors . 
  that 's exactly why poland is so close to the us in defence matters , cause we know who can we count on . 
   if you still have that much grief with enemies of the past then you 'd have no friends at all and you 'd be squashed between the eu and russia , ukraine is having fun with that at the moment . 
  between the eu and russia ? 
  did you miss that poland is part of the eu ? 
  `` england is squashed between the uk and the us , hurr durr ''  it might sound harsh considering the huge impact ww2 had on poland , but stop living in the past . 
  did you miss the part where i am living and working in germany ? 
  so are more than 2 million other poles . 
  we are not living in the past , just remembering it to optimize any decisions in the future . 
   poland never had very far to fall anyway , making it up from the bottom is pretty hard when your people struggle to get off the ground . 
  if our best moments are in the past then so be it , we have influenced the future far more than poland ever will . 
  if you count the us , sure . 
  otherwise , most of britain influence has been overwritten already . 
  english language being lingua franca ? 
  thanks to the us . 
  imperial system ? 
  gone ( ironically , except the us ) ...  but i was not praising chamberlain , i was saying you are simply not understanding the position he was in , or of the various opinions floating around at the time and what had created them . 
  the more you argue about this the clearer this becomes . 
  sure you were n't , of course not . 
  ( / s ) i completely understand him up to the sudetenland , even if i do n't support that . 
  sure , give the crazy maniac austria and the sudetenland , or crimea and donetsk , in order to avoid war . 
  i see the logic . 
  when hitler decided to invade and partition the rest of czecholslovakia it was already too far . 
  but you have no obligation to be the `` world police '' , * ` murica style * , so sure , let it slide . 
  when he invaded a supposed `` ally '' and all you do is a formal finger shaking , that is a big no-no . 
   so france and britain are traitors , the us did n't even want to start the war even after poland got invaded and they did n't truly care about the whole thing until pearl harbour , so i guess they are cowards along with the rest of the allies . 
  the us owed poland nothing , the was no treaty that would bind them to help poland . 
  as i said twice already , i am only talking about france and britain who were supposed to be poland 's allies . 
  maybe third time 's the charm ? 
   are you going to be angry at everyone ? 
  nope , just france and britain ( counter = 4 ) . 
   quite honestly none of this matters anyway , is there a country that has never broken an agreement ? 
  one that important with such huge repercussions ? 
  maybe there is , but i 'm not a historian so i ca n't think of any . 
  hitler attacking the soviet union is probably worse , although they just had a non-agression , not an alliance ...  is there a country that has never been at fault for something in its history ? 
  is poland the little angel of the east that the whole world should look up to ? 
  i do n't think so , i 'm sure some countries have grievances against poland . 
  ( also , i never claimed that , so nice goalpost moving there ) . 
   britain may not have helped poland that much , but no one else did either . 
  no one else was supposed to . 
   you were in a bad position and nothing short of a miracle could have changed history . 
  that 's debatable . 
   what 's done is done , poland has been made irrelevant by history , some other countries have fallen from much higher   but the future is looking up . 
  meh , i 'm not that optimistic . 
   i think you can tell from my comment that i ca n't even be bothered to read your idiotic rant about how awful the uk and france is . 
  yeah , that 's usually the case when you run out of arguments , the good old `` your points are idiotic and i did n't even read them , so i do n't have to address them , let me stick my fingers in my ears and sing a song really loudly '' . 
  let me sum it up for you : `` france and britain = traitors '' . 
   if you want an argument about ww2 then i suggest you take it to / r/askhistorians [ 1 ] i subscribe that subreddit since the beginning , thank you very much . 
  have n't seen anyone praising chamberlain yet ... 
  wait ... if the baltics never were in cis and did n't participate in the legal process of leaving the soviet union , and russia and all the other countries left ... does this mean that legally speaking the baltics * are * the soviet union now ? 
  edit : a word . 
  i said `` revolves around '' on purpose . 
  as in `` 95 % of the time you are using your foot '' , not `` you get to use your foot after a touchdown get 2 extra points '' . 
  also , `` ball '' , not `` egg '' :p, 
  i actually torrented and watched the last two superbowls . 
  it was quite entertaining , to be honest . 
  there was very little foot involved , and there was no ball * per se * , but it * was * entertaning . 
  7/10 would watch again . 
  we have no excuse for the [ world series ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_series ) , tho . 
  the one that revolves around kicking a ** ball ** with your ** foot ** :p, 
   you are asking me to get off my high horse ? 
  yes . 
   you 're pretending like the whole world did everything wrong and you know exactly how they should have done things . 
  no , not the whole wide world , just france and britain . 
  hell , even hungary , a nazi ally , did more to help poland than france and britain . 
   you 're claiming that it was an idiotic idea at the time to try and stay away from another world war . 
  no , it was a good idea when it had a chance to work ( let 's say austria ) . 
  it was a unfortunate idea when it was doubtful it would work ( let 's say sudetenland ) , if was a very bad idea when it was clear it would n't work ( let 's say , the rest of czechoslovakia ) . 
  it was borderline treason when you left your ally , with whom you signed a fucking treaty , left alone in times of war . 
  and i 'm being generous with `` borderline '' . 
  do n't want to fight hitler ? 
  reaaally want to avoid a war ? 
  easy : do n't fucking sign alliances with his `` enemies '' . 
  do you see me ranting against the usa ? 
  or portugal ? 
  or romania ? 
  they did n't help poland either , but they were n't supposed `` allies '' . 
   you really do n't see how hindsight changes your view ? 
  i mean , you have numbers now set in stone that the uk never had , we did n't have the benefit of knowing what we would get ourselves in to . 
  do you know why you have those numbers and facts ? 
  i 'm getting pretty tired of pointing this out to you . 
  and i 'm tired of pointing out that many people of the time ( remember churchill ? ), 
  saw what was happening way before 1939 . 
  and again : do n't want to go to war over poland ? 
  do n't fucking sign an alliance with poland . 
  nobody forced you to . 
   on the immigration part i was just poking a bit , but really , poles that have moved here are great people . 
  are you actually still in poland ? 
  nope , i 'm in germany . 
  not because they were such great guys back in the day , either ...  in the uk polish people would be fine with saying that the uk 's position at the time was incorrect , but arguing it as stupidly as you are just reeks of disrespect . 
  signing an alliance and leaving your ally alone against * literally hitler * reeks of treason . 
  if expecting help from your allies in times of war is stupid , i do n't want to know what clever is .
