   poland may have suffered far far greater losses , but you should n't disrespect the efforts of our military during the war . 
  i admit that once hitler turned his sights to the west , britain suffered a lot and made great efforts . 
  that does n't change the fact that in 1939 there was no efforts to disrespect . 
  was printing all those pamphlets tiring ? 
   it would certainly not be very appreciated . 
  [ speaking about appretiation ... ] ( http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/the-polish-air-force-in-world-war-2/303-squadron.aspx )  lastly , i see you have been doing some poking of your own , sure i have . 
   the power of countries changes very quickly , the us wo n't be top dog for long hard to say . 
   and germany wo n't be the biggest economic power in europe for long if it does n't manage to sort out the population drop . 
  japan has much worse population problems and is still a serious economic powerhouse . 
   asia is rising , and then africa will in the long term as well . 
  if i wanted to do some more poking then i 'd mention that poland has n't ever been a truly global power not on the scale of britain in the 19th century or the us in the 20th ( much less genocide \\* cough * irish famine \\* cough * on our consciences , \\* cough * bengal famine \\* cough \\* ) , but we had our moments of glory , including * saving europe * twice ( 1683 in vienna and 1920 in warsaw ) . 
   and it 's very very unlikely that it ever will be . 
  afaik , it 's not even poland 's goal . 
   i wo n't even have to go in to the number of things that the uk has influenced due to its past , you probably know most of them anyway . 
  it 's safe to say that poland has influenced very little , and the little poland did , britain took credit for ( talking about enigma here ) . 
   and due to the rise of asia , no individual european country will be able to do much on it 's own in the future . 
  all of this is down to geography and a bit of luck though , poland got fucked on both of those . 
  our choice of friends has been known to be less than stellar , too . 
  that traffic is not considered internet traffic because it 's literally not * inter * - net , it 's * intra * - net , never leaves the network of the provider and the provider can do whatever they want with their internal traffic . 
  the legal status of this services is completely and 100 % clear and not at all the point of these negotiations . 
   very interesting and concise input . 
  let 's see if i can give you a good answer . 
  i do n't know how to make those `` quote '' things ( kinda new to reddit ) , so bear with me . 
  you start the line with a '  ' , like email clients usually do . 
    1st point : you mentioned a reduction in risk , which makes up for a reduction in profit . 
  can you elaborate a little on it ? 
  let 's say a surgeon wants to borrow 1000 euros from you . 
  you are pretty much guaranteed that , unless he dies , he will pay back , so you ask for 1010 euros back ( or 1000 to `` break even '' ) . 
  now the junkie from the corner asks for 1000 euros . 
  it 's possible they will go ( more ) bankrupt , overdose , or just run with your money . 
  you are taking a lot of risk ( let 's say 50/50 chance you will lose the money ) so you ask for 2010 euros back to make your risk be worth it ( or 2000 to `` break even '' ) . 
   as i understand it , you 're basically talking about how the eu secured those loans in the long-term instead of short-term , or am i wrong ? 
  if that 's the case , the way i see it , they 're basically binding their time by selling a lie to both their own people and the greeks ( that being that austerity measures are actually efficient ) . 
  what i 'm saying is that they are prolonging the process in order to add up more interest . 
  i am no economist either , so my language is a bit low tenor etc , but i hope you understand what i 'm trying to say . 
  no , my point was different . 
  i 'm also no economist , but i read the news . 
  the situation is that `` the market '' was seeing greece as a risky investments and asking for more than 10 % interest on loans . 
  this was a suicide for greece but they were kind of forced to take those loans ( ironically , to avoid a defualt ) , spiraling into more debt . 
  the eu came in and said `` ok , we will loan you money at just 2 % '' ( or whatever the exact number was ) . 
  but it 's true that greece was a risky investment , so 2 % was too little profit for the risk the eu countries were taking . 
  so in this case , greece being `` the junkie '' ( no offense intended ) , you ask him to shave , look for a job , invest part of the money to rent an apartment and dial back the drugs . 
  this would be the `` austerity measures '' . 
  you force the party taking the money to do * unpleasant stuff * in order to reduce the risk that they will not pay you back , because you are not charging them much for the loan . 
   2nd point : there was no official statement that imposed this in any way , to my knowledge . 
  i think it was mostly a rather suspicious `` side effect '' of imposing the memorandum . 
  kind of like `` stop spending so much money ... here ... buy this cool shit i personally made instead ... it 's good shit , bro '' . 
  it does n't help that german products tend to be cheaper than greek ones , which in turn means they actually find a good `` audience '' here . 
  which products are we talking about ? 
  everything with a `` made in germany '' sticker is expensive as fuck in germany , from cars to damn frying pans . 
   3rd point : precisely . 
  keeping those public sectors purely greek would ensure a steady income flow . 
  we 're talking about national utility companies here . 
  instead of that , we were told to auction them off , even after raising their rates ( as in , how much electricity costs monthly ) or including taxes in the bill . 
  as to why no rich greek man decided to buy any of these utility companies , i have no idea or data from which to draw ideas . 
  i would suppose the foreign companies raised the stakes higher than the rich greek guys could manage , but that 's just an assumption . 
  in either case , we were forced to remove a significant asset . 
  this seems like a bad idea ** if ** : * the companies were profitable ( some public companies are famous for waste , not only in greece but all around the world ) , ** and ** * the profits from the companies were higher than the interest rate multiplied by their value . 
  example : you have a loan at 2 % . 
  company a gives you a profit of 10 euros a year . 
  you can sell it for 1000 euros . 
  since you would have to pay 20 euros to borrow the 1000 euros , it 's better to sell the company , lose the 10 euro income but avoid the 20 euro interest . 
  you end up saving 10 euros in total . 
  if the company gives you 30 euros a year however , it 's better to keep the company , borrow the money and pay the 20 euro interest , because you can pay the interest and still keep 10 euros profit . 
  so it all boils down to * how * profitable those companies were , which sadly is hard to know because you can always `` fudge the numbers '' to make it look however you want in the short term ...  4th point : yes , but that 's the problem ... people make mistakes and the program failed . 
  the imf used greece as testing grounds for more severe austerity measures in comparison to other countries and when they saw that they had the opposite effect , they refused to back off and change the plan . 
  our previous government did nothing but bent the knee and try to/implement everything as they were told , but the thing is they either could n't do it effectively in this economy or they did it effectively , which in turn worsened the economy so other measures were no longer applicable . 
  this is the point where a real economist would be handy . 
  i have nothing to say about this one way or the other since it 's dependant on a million factors ( fraud , loopholes , even people 's morale to spend their money `` activating '' the economy ) and requires a lot of verified data ( that is very hard to get ) . 
   5th point : actually , the official unemployment rate in greece is 35 % ( the unofficial is much higher due to lack of records ) and the same as spain in youth unemployment , 60 % ( at least officially ) . 
  and it 's just that ... most of us are these poor people that work 10h a week for 300 euros a month . 
  i 'm not talking just about greece , but all eastern or southern european countries that fall under the same category . 
  how we ended up trying to crap out money we do n't have for a debt that was n't our fault ( as the people , not as a constitution/country ) is incomprehensible to me . 
  but where all that crapped-out money goes is kind of less mysterious . 
  i would assume that government officials and bankers somehow end up with very fat pockets all of a sudden ... 
  i was talking about figures when the loans were given . 
  spain was 27 and greece was around 20 , iirc . 
  now spain is now doing a bit better ( 25 , i think ) and greece a bit ( lot ? ), 
  worse than back then ... 
  afaiu being late is not exactly an automatic default , so it could be a dangerous , but effective way to negotiate ... 
   to allow dedicated connections on the same physical infrastructure with high reliability guarantees that you ca n't get on a public tcp/ip link . 
  as i said , that already exist . 
  see for instance [ this in germany ] ( https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/startseite/festnetz/vernetzung/159446/ethernetconnect.html ) or [ this in the us ] ( http://business.comcast.com/ethernet/products/virtual-private-line ) . 
  they do n't roll out 2.000 miles of ethernet cable , just send your traffic with 100 % priority over their network . 
  usually net neutrality negotiations go around `` our customers use netflix a lot and it costs us more money than them just chatting , let us charge netflix to make sure their traffic does n't ... have an unfortunate accident '' . 
  seems like speculation ... 
  i 'm unaware of any goalposts moved by the eu since ... 2008 ? 
  afaik they are fighting to uphold the original bailout terms , and greece is fighting to relax them . 
  there 's no much goalpost-moving possible when your posture is to keep the status-quo . 
  i 'm professionally involved in networking and if someone does remote surgery over the public internet they are criminally stupid . 
  remote surgery is fine , but isps offer `` dedicated connections '' for uses like this . 
  yes , they are expensive but they come with guarantees ( and hopefully , backups ) . 
  this problem is solved , if someone * really * needs a reliable service , they can get it , no need to remove net neutrality for it . 
   we 'll know more when the full legal text is drafted ( has n't been at this point in the process ) and published . 
  agreed . 
  and i can almost assure you it will be bad and full of loopholes for the telcos to charge more money to their customers :(, 
  so `` rejects but keeps a window open '' ? 
  it all seems like a tsipras ' strategy to fall behind on payments , really really almost default and the get slightly better deal . 
  or am i interpreting this wrong ? 
  is `` try '' too much to ask ?
