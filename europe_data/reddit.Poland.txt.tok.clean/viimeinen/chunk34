  churchill made mistakes ? 
  sure , you can take a wrong tactical decision in a war , but leaving an ally alone while throwing pamphlets on the nazis is n't a mistake , it 's a fucking travesty . 
  yes the nazis defeated the allies ... after regrouping and re-supplying and having their eastern front secure . 
  look at the numbers in 1939 . 
  the nazis were not really prepared for war . 
  hitler counted on poland giving up * danzig * like the czechs gave up the * sudetenland * , just because everyone was so afraid of the war . 
  the `` allies '' had a vastly superior force at the time , and germany actually depleted a lot of their supplies fighting the outdated polish army . 
  the luftwaffe and panzer divisions were running low on fuel and not super well on munitions even . 
  now imagine if they had to fight on two fronts , the west one against overwhelmingly superior forces , modern tanks and airplanes , virtually unlimited resources and no initiative ( even in 1940 , the allies had a 3:2 advantage but the nazis had the initiative ) . 
  and you did n't * go * to war over poland , you * declared * war . 
  war later * came * to you . 
  people moving to the uk has to do with being the easiest * wealthy * country to immigrate to , cause there 's no need to learn a language from scratch , it has nothing to do with your value as an ally . 
  there 's almost 3 times more poles in germany than in the uk , that does n't mean we love hitler . 
  last but not least ... you might not care about the polish opinion or * need * poland 's support , but bush and blair were all too happy to accept it in afghanistan and later iraq . 
  get off your high horse , the empire ended and britannia no longer rules . 
  usa rules the world and germany , europe . 
   if you have 10.000 phone lines in your subscription package , sure . 
  that 's not voip you are thinking about , that 's internet-based telephone service , which * uses * voip . 
  voip is a technology , not a service . 
  voip is synonymous with h. 323 or sip or a proprietary protocol like skype . 
  there is no limit on the voip streams that you can open right now , and hopefully thanks to neutrality there never will be . 
   you do n't know how iptv works , do you ? 
  i know exactly how it works . 
  again you are probably thinking about isp-provided iptv . 
  not the same as iptv , no matter what the guys in marketing think . 
  as long as i get my tv and my internet from different providers , my isp has no way to know what is coming in the rtsp stream . 
  see , * technically * you fullfilled you obligations . 
  what a great ally to have . 
  thank you for your help . 
   can you really blame them ? 
  yes , yes i can . 
  in fact , churchill did , and last time i checked he was no hindsight armchair general . 
   besides , britain and france going in a land war against the soviets and the nazis at the same time in a territory that is n't bordering either britain or france but is bordering both nazi germany and the ussr , you think that would go well ? 
  * the soviets did n't invade poland until september 17th , two full weeks after the start of the `` war '' , two and a half after the german invasion . 
  it took the soviets and the nazis together more than 5 weeks to defeat poland alone . 
  for reference , it took the nazis alone just 10 days more to defeat an alliance of france , uk , belgium and the netherlands , so poland put up an amazing fight , fighting alone . 
  if the `` allies '' would have moved their asses and had at least pretended to send help , i have my doubts the soviet union would so happily even invaded poland , changing dramatically the outcome . 
  why do you think the us nowadays has troops in the baltics ? 
  * it was n't even necessary for france and britain to fight * in * poland . 
  france alone had 3 time more tanks than germany in 1939 and all of germany 's tanks were 600 km away . 
  and more than 400 km of border . 
  they chose to stay behind their air-conditioned maginot line . 
  apparently , manufacturing white flags . 
   be angry at the nazis and soviets for it was their actions that did this , do n't be angry at us . 
  i can be angry at both , thank you very much . 
  do n't be surprised when you see polls that show that the us nowadays has much better image in poland than the uk and france . 
  especially with russia poking here and there . 
  rest assured nobody in poland counts on france 's or britain 's assistance , push comes to shove . 
  for poland the outcome was absolutely the same as if britain did n't , 0 help from our `` allies '' . 
  what i 'd rather is allies have their allies ' back , not * technically * fullfilling treaties and hiding behind the maginot line while having 3 times more armored divisions than an enemy who is fighting on the opposite border of their territory anyway , like cowards . 
  you open 10.000 streams . 
  done . 
  or use iptv , as you suggested . 
  done . 
   trying not to get in to another world war where millions would die ? 
  well said mr. chamberlain . 
  good job having your allies ' backs , too . 
  so basically let 's all tunnel our ftp traffic over voip and get super fast downloads ? 
  i agree that anything short of full neutrality is bad , since it 's open to be badly exploited and offer potentially worse service than a neutral net . 
  that is the reason why skype does not allow you to call emergency services . 
   yes ? 
  how is what was going on in europe relevant to time taken to mobilise ? 
  well , germany annexing neighbouring countries for two years and announcing it would invade a third one should give you plenty of time for mobilization . 
  is there any historian that claims that france and britain were `` unprepared '' ? 
  all i have read is that they consciously decided to bomb germany with pamphlets instead of ordnance not to anger hitler . 
  britain and france really needed to mobilise and re-arm with what was going on in europe at the time ? 
  please ... 
  i meant the name , `` bavaria '' sounds german but it 's dutch . 
  bastards stole ( and tarnished ) the name xd, 
   unlike bavaria , for example ironically , a dutch beer . 
  poland knows something about this ... 
  in other news , the white house discovered that there are large deposits of oil in russia ... 
  not your brightest moment , tho ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war, 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  now i can not sign it !, 
  i wonder if they practice in front of the mirror to say those thing with a straight face ... 
  if mongolia starts to review who illegally declared independence from them since 1227 , a number of countries will be unhappy . 
  they did . 
  i 'm not 100 % if * all * , but i think so . 
  thanks for your answer . 
  let me offer some `` devil 's advocate '' thoughts . 
   no european country is sitting there , busting their balls to `` help '' greece out of their pure heart of gold . 
  they are making profit out of it . 
  well , every country has been hit by the crisis in some way or another . 
  it 's hard to sell to your voters `` let 's give greece xx billion euros '' when the people are demanding better jobs , healthcare , education or road maintenance for themselves ( it 's the people 's money after all ) . 
  you must sell it as `` but we 're going to make a profit from it '' . 
  this is particularly true from countries that have standards of living lower than greece itself ( eastern european in particular ) . 
  the whole bailout however is based on the concept of `` reduced profits '' . 
  greece was borrowing money at 10 % + interest rate , which was the `` fair '' rate on the market but also unsustainable . 
  the eu agreed to lend money at x % . 
  the difference , 10-x , is what the eu is actually losing ( as in `` opportunity cost '' ) by lending money to greece . 
  to make up for this reduction in profit the eu requested a reduction in risk , therefore the evil `` austerity '' . 
   for instance , ever since the austerity measures were well established in our economy , there was a significant rise in german imports . 
  is there any particular contact clause that imposes this by force ? 
  or is it simply government/people/companies having slightly more money than before the bailout and buying german products ? 
  hard to tell without more data ...  also , a lot of public sectors were auctioned to private detainers and to my knowledge , bought by foreign companies . 
  as you said here , they were auctioned . 
  rich greeks could have bought them , they did n't . 
  if you have money problems but have assets , it is only logical to sell those assets ( unless the assets produce more profit than the interest rate of your loan , then you should fight not to sell them ) .
