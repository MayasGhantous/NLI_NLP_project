   we can not afford to pay back that much and those governments , disregarding our situation entirely , force us to cough up money that we ca n't afford to lose if we actually want to stir our economy instead of just paying back a debt . 
  yes , but you paint those governments as mafia types that somehow woke up one day and decided to fuck up a country . 
  the payments were agreed and established long time ago , and everyone knew they were coming ... additionally , the whole `` austerity '' program was done exactly so greece would be able to afford those payments ( from what i 've read , i 'm not an economist ) . 
  now it seems that the greek government refuses to implement the measures that would make them save money and then complains about not having money . 
  that is the look from the outside , at least . 
   basically , instead of giving a poor man a job and asking him to pay you back a bit of what he owes you each month , you beat him up and just demand of him to somehow find the money by `` stop spending so much '' . 
  have you tried to look at it from the other side ? 
  for the other countries is like a man that has a job that pays 1000 euros a month and he insists on living spending 1200 euros buying alcohol and cigarettes ( unnecessary spending ) , working only 6h a day ( early retirement ) , letting people steal from him ( tax fraud ) and driving a luxury car ( the aforementioned assets ) . 
  there are people that make 3000 euros a month and spend 2.950 working 8h a day that have saved some and are willing to lend money and probably can afford to make no profit at all from the whole ordeal ( germany , netherlands , etc ) . 
  it does n't help to go on the street comparing this countries to hitler , but well , sometimes you need to vent . 
  now , keep in mind that in the lenders group there are also people like you , that are struggling ( spain , italy ) and lend you money instead of fixing their own problems , spain iirc lent greece 26 billion euros while having higher unemployment themselves ( 27 % , almost 60 % for young workers ) . 
  even poor people that make 300 euros a month working 10h a day ( eastern countries ) . 
  it 's very hard to convince them to lend money to someone who works less , lives better and on top of that is complaining all the time . 
  poland for instance is looking to lose 7 billion euros that they desperately need . 
  finally , since the crisis started greece has received hundreds of billions of euros , at least . 
  all greeks that i have read agreed that the conditions in the country have only gotten worse in this time . 
  have you even wondered ... where did all this enormous amount of money go ? 
  maybe there you can find some bad guys ... 
  in finance you often hear `` past performance does not guarantee future results '' . 
  i 'm curious : what do you have in mind when you say  we just want you to stop trying to exploit the country and try to make some logical terms together with us . 
  who is `` you '' ? 
  how are they exploiting greece ? 
  i moved from madrid to munich . 
  cost of living is similar . 
  salaries in it are basically double 1.000 -  2.000 . 
  a month has 4 weekends . 
  a return trip with lufthansa is 200 $ normal , 100 $ on sale . 
  math indicates that i could go back home every weekend of the year and still end up with at least 20 % more money in my pocket . 
  this eu thing is fucking great . 
   although i can easily believe if you say that there were n't any better options this is 100 % the people 's fault . 
  there is no politician factory in china . 
  people create parties . 
  when people have enough , ( really enough ) they create a new party and vote for it . 
  see spain and podemos . 
  i saw in a documentary that is costs around 5 cents to ship a liter can of food from china . 
  sure , it probably has lead and mercury and who knows what , but shipping is dirty cheap . 
  germany could do it unilaterally . 
  simply by giving the visas . 
  probably talking about the referendum ? 
  just fyi , in munich a studio apparment , so a bathroom + one room that works as kitchen/livingroom/bedroom , usually around 20m ^ 2 , is around 600 $ . 
  having separate living room and bedroom is a luxury already , 
  `` slightly '', 
  i guess you mean 150 $ -200 $ ? 
  that is on the upper end of the scale for a single person even in munich , i never spend that much , i do n't drink at all , tho . 
  also in munich , i pay 51 $ / month for power for 2 people ( 0.3 $ / kwh , ouch ) and 40 $ for 100mbit internet connection ( there are cheaper connections , but ... 
  internets ! ) . 
  water and heat included in the rent . 
  we live in less than 50m ^ 2 , btw , an that 's two people . 
  shampoo ( to keep with the example ) at dm costs 0.7 $ for a medium bottle , which lasts about a month . 
  if you live in an austere fashion 500 $ could actually be doable even here , all depending on you rent , it would have to be a room in a shared appartment , obviously ) . 
  tldr : agreed , 50m ^ 2 for 1 person is luxury , 200 $ in bills is splurging . 
  do n't understand the downvotes : / polan is stronk , but has always been house of kurwa . 
  from what i know , they were * disliked * because they were `` the 1 % '' . 
  disliked , not hated or prosecuted . 
  and probably not * discriminated * , as they were the ones in * many * positions of power/money . 
  definitely no legal/official discrimination . 
  there is something even today that you could call antisemitism , especially if you compare poland with countries like france , where making fun of muslims is your sacred right but making fun of jews gets you fired . 
  what i get from people i talk to is * distrust * of jews . 
  as in `` this politician is jewish , i bet he/she has the best interest of israel in mind , not poland '' . 
  tl ; dr : no support for genocide in poland , no fanboyism of jews either . 
   finland is in good terms with russia and countries like poland are n't finland managed to pull an awesome defence and avoided 50 years of soviet de-facto occupation . 
  occupations tend to do that , you know , sour the relations between countires . 
  especially when the other side denies them one day and brags about them all proud the next one . 
  see how easy is it to be smug and edgy when you have poland and germany between you and russia ? 
  if nato expanded `` far beyond the north atlantic '' is because they were asked to , and even today many people in eastern europe ask for * more * american/nato presence . 
  this is best read with some metal playing in the background . 
  i 'm pretty sure they do n't play those games in turkey anymore ... 
  yeah , cause that always works * so * well for them ... 
  believe me , poland could n't care less about brussels in military matters , no matter where the nato hq is . 
  after wwii , polish people have a great mistrust of european powers when it comes to russia , and only the us have shown to share some conviction standing up to the russians . 
  see for instance the post on the front page about the french guy asking to lift the sanctions while russia has n't moved from crimea or eastern ukraine . 
  it 's the old the enemy of my enemy is my friend , and other european nations are too far away from russia to consider them an enemy , so washington it is . 
  that did n't happen !, 
  not so simple , unfortunately . 
  once you accept an idea , you fight any data refuting it . 
  your brain does * not * like to be wrong . 
  they are victims , imho . 
  or trolls ... 
  and iirc , it was precisely the swedes that detected the cloud and sounded the alarm . 
  it 's practically the only reason other countries in eastern europe joined . 
  i would love for poland to be neutral but being a flat country and so close to russia , i say choose the lesser of two evils and cosy up to the americans . 
   i thought ~ ~ there ~ ~ ** their ** position was germany should leave the euro . 
  that would at least make more sense ... ftfy . 
  but it 's the eu so ~ ~ they ~ ~ * we * will do it nonetheless . 
  the people doing it are people who we all/most of us voted for . 
  * we * are accountable for their actions . 
  that 's awesome . 
  many providers offer just the dubbed version , no subtitles . 
  which sucks if you do n't speak the local language . 
   the ~ ~ pirate ~ ~ ** viking ** life for me . 
  ftfy, 
  it 's in poland now . 
  the stealing vehicles business is going green !, 
  austria would like to have a word with you ... 
  interesting , never heard those stereotypes myself ... 
  might be , but ... bulgaria ? 
  that 's also not the main point of my comment . 
  whoever translated it , put random `` the `` s in the translation . 
  the word `` the '' does n't exist in polish , so do n't read much into it . 
  [ blink twice if you need help !,
