  i 'm wondering ... wtf is people 's problem with bulgaria ? 
  i 'm not aware of any historic conflict and on a personal level all the bulgarian people i know are super nice ... 
  you 'd be pretty high tho . 
  people high very high opinion of the swiss , like a better and improved kind of germans , which the anschluss part replaced by more ordnung  gr\u00fcezi !, 
  very unlikely . 
  anglicy * could * mean british ( technically it 's * englishmen * ) but ireland is just missing . 
  oh , the power of the germoneis ... 
  after some number crunching , my calculations indicate that 50 % of the people answering might have indeed been women . 
  afair , austria was also the least hated invader in the 19th century ... `` incident '' . 
  my guess : immigrate and behave * strangely * . 
  poles are not the most tolerant with other cultures ... 
  remember that probably 50 % of the polled were women  same reason goes for spain probably ... 
  looking at how many people support them ( because reasons ) , i 'm not * so * optimistic ... 
  it 's sad that they must be told something like that ... 
  no problem  the 0.75 % comes from the original data set , the graph with % of hiv per country . 
  there is no calculation involved . 
  isis makes millions of dollars of profit * per day * selling oil . 
  if not with refugees , they will introduce agents by yacht if need be . 
  terrorism is only an excuse poles/europeans use now to rationalize their views . 
  use logic , get downvoted . 
  we do n't need you ruining our xenophobia !, 
   poland is not completely xenophobic  downvoted apparently on reddit , we are :(, 
   confirmed or imminent terrorist attacks that have been subdued days within happening maybe because they have better intelligence for those ? 
  agent * m\u00fcller * can easily be * mr. schmidt * to infiltrate the welovehitler group , not so easy for him to be * muhammed ibn mustafa * to infiltrate isis ... 
  it 's not xenophobia , it 's democracy and values and ... [ insert more bs reasons to excuse xenophobia ],

  there was no independence at the end of ww2 . 
  you 're thinking 1989 . 
  being `` not forbidden '' and being `` good '' or `` correct '' or `` welcome '' should n't be equivalent . 
  yes , they have the right to oppose . 
  they also have the right to say 1 +1 equals * the batman symbol * . 
  that does n't make it right or productive . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  the museum is meh , but the panorama rac\u0142awicka across the street is really kickass , must-see if you ever visit the city . 
   oh boy , now i miss my old parker pens . 
  i better pick one up next time i 'm in town ... and as always ... thanks for watching . 
   eu nationalists is n't that an oxymoron ? 
  as long as it 's not kinder eggs , you do n't want the fbi knoking at your door ... , 
  or use it as a reason to leave the eu , because * turkey * is in !, 
  where in germany ? 
  i 'm in munich and travel frequently to poland  also , there is a polish shop in the center  edit : https://www.amazon.de/28-st%c3%bcck-prince-polo-18g/dp/b004wj4tha, 
  is it true that some polish chocolate bar ( price polo i think ) is super popular over there ? 
  just do n't try to send us h\u00e1karl back ... 
  holy fuck those subtitles took * a bit * of an artistic license . 
  half of the lyrics are made up . 
  but with such a large diaspora i 'd imagine anyone has an uncle/cousin/school friend that has emigrated to the west precisely because the living conditions are better over there . 
  how do people concile the two ? 
  he would still do it better than m\u00fcller ... 
  no idea , ask / u/wikirexmax for the difference , i was just being sarcastic . 
  bah , `` kind of '' does n't count !, 
  life is n't fair then . 
  you get the awesome `` icelandic chant '' and the only thing portugal gets is griezmann 's stupid dance . 
  you are amazed , they are champions , everybody happy !, 
  with portugal using the same tactic as france in the previous match . 
  talk about karma ... 
   ronaldo wins the euros and the champions league . 
  well , no matter how many euro cups of sport you win , you will never win the euro cup of `` justice '' , i guess . 
  we 're co-champions !, 
  is a beautiful sport . 
  i also like basketball . 
  the thing is ** france ** did n't do it in this euro until they saw it from the icelanders . 
  no one is saying icelanders invented it , just that france copied it from them . 
  look at mr. moneybags over here , wants everyone to know he has potato ... 
  they 'll wipe their tears [ with this ] ( https://imgur.com/1agjk1l ) . 
  we did n't even lose against them ( or anyone else for that matter ) !, 
  poland are now officially co-champions !, 
   anyone claiming there 'll be large scale manufacturing ** jobs ** in the uk ( or us ) is trying to sell you something . 
  just want to point out : jobs is the key word here . 
  there * could * be large scale manufacturing per se , but it would be automated and create just a small amount of highly specialized jobs . 
  * britannia waives the rules, 
  the hardest part is to get people educated and willing . 
  i like the `` liquid democracy '' concept , where you can delegate your votes to people of your chosing ( friends , family , famous politicians ) only for certain votes/certain topics . 
  you have a friend you trust and that is good with computers ? 
  let him vote for you on cs topics . 
  you have a brother who is a doctor ? 
  let him vote for you on health issues . 
  etc , etc. 
   it is impossible for large number of people to vote without some kind of representational type of democracy . 
  * was with the right kind of crypto ( and loads of education ) it would be possible now . 
  and call it `` fish and french fries '' . 
   steering requires greater precision and dexterity than shifting gears . 
  source ? 
  intuitively i 'd think that shifting gears ( push lever to neutral , move it to the side , but not too far , because you can engage reverse , push it again until you feel the next gear engaged ) is a much more complex movement than steering ( 99.99 % of the time : keep steering wheel in the exact same position , straight ) . 
  i 'd love to see a scientific study on the matter , i might be wrong . 
  i 'm not an economist , but i do n't think poland having a separate currency had much to do . 
  the value has n't changed much in the last 15 years , hovering around 4pln / $ . 
  it had one big swing * during * the 2008 crisis and after that it has remained relatively stable . 
  as long as you accept the * one true side of the road * , you 'll be welcome anywhere , 
   you ca n't survey every man and woman in the country . 
  that does n't mean they are false , but in cases so complex , using simple percantage of people is like trying to dig a mine with a spoon please , educate yourself about statistics . 
  start here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margin_of_error#different_confidence_levels  you try to make poland look like christian bigotland just because it does n't go well with your idea of how the world should be as i said , the data is there : 84 % support in spain , 97 % in the netherlands , 37 % support in poland . 
   right now you want to tell me you know better than me how it is here because you 've seen statistics ** yes ** . 
  so much yes . 
  absolutely yes . 
  a thousand time yes . 
  a statistical study is so much better than your close circle of friends , your extended circle of friends , your family , or your dog . 
   that 's so silly i wo n't even bother to reply to you anymore see ? 
  this is basically : science ( statistics ) is bullshit , * you * know somehow magically better because of ... reasons . 
  ** perfect example ** of the hidden influence of religion in the mentality of the average person . 
  dismiss science , close eyes , listen to a `` higher power '' .
