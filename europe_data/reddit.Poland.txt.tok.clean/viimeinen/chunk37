  thank you . 
  thank you very much for confirming my hypothesis . 
   i think discussion should end when you put words in other peoples mouth well ...  i do n't think statistics give it justice . 
  so , yeah , you said it . 
  and then :  statistics are statistics in some cases they 're hard to compare with reality you said it again . 
  no putting of words in mouths here . 
  so let me say it again : i do n't like to talk with people who argue that `` statistics are false , my close circle of friends is where the truth lies '' . 
  statistics are not `` hard to compare with reality '' , statistics are the reality . 
   i do n't think statistics give it justice . 
  well , this is where our discussion ends . 
  i do n't like to talk with people who argue that `` statistics are false , my close circle of friends is where the truth lies '' . 
  i agree that among younger people the differences are * smaller * , but they are still there . 
  among the population in general , well , the statistics are there . 
  as i posted in another comment , 37 % people in poland support gay rights , 28 % support gay marriage . 
  numbers are 84 % and 72 % in spain , and 97 % and 91 % in the netherlands ( highest in europe ) . 
  you can easily deduce that , while support among spanish/dutch youth is pretty close 100 % to have those averages , in poland is probably around 50 to 60 % ( assuming typical population distribution , and best case scenario where `` old people '' give 0 % support ) . 
  100 % vs 60 % is still a major difference in my book . 
  maybe you happen to have very liberal friends , but the general feeling is nowhere close to that , and my anecdotal evidence ( family/friends in poland ) concurs that polish people are more on the conservative side . 
  combine that with the relatively strong church influence and it 's easy to come to the conclusion that one is related to the other , even if some people do n't make the conscious connection . 
  i understand completely what you 're saying , i just disagree . 
  as a semi-external observer , i am amazed on how much religion has an influence on my relatives ' day-to-day lives compared to my friends ' lives in spain . 
  maybe it 's harder to see from within , when you take certain things for granted . 
   it 's more complicated - young people in poland are overwhelmingly for marijuana legalization . 
  they use contraceptives . 
  like 90 % of them . 
  they are mostly for abortion legalization , but it 's less clear cut . 
  and they were mostly for lgbt rights or at least they were a few years - it seems to change recently . 
  i never said there were n't people who are progressive , i said that they are just * less * progressive than people in other countries . 
  and no need to make up numbers and cherrypick among `` my friends '' ( who support marijuana , gay rights , euthanasia , etc , in pretty much 100 % , i never even thought of contraceptives as a `` controversial '' issue ) . 
  look at the statistics , if you support gay rights in 37 % ( [ source , page 50 ] ( http://www.equineteurope.org/img/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf ) ) you are going to seem more conservative than countries were 84 % of the total population supports it ( spain , same source ) . 
  the netherlands , btw , has 97 % support for gay rights . 
  let that sink in . 
  in poland , 63 % of the population think gays should have less rights than other people based on who they sleep with , which is none of the people 's business . 
  moreover , 72 % of poles think homosexuals should n't be allowed to get married . 
  if , on top of that , your reason for not supporting gay rights is `` because it 's a sin '' , you are going to look like a religious twat . 
  i congratulate you for having such forward-thinking , open-minded friends , but neither you nor your friends are a good sample to represent the general population . 
  edit : a few clarifications . 
  according to the latest statistics , the czech republic is the least religious country in europe . 
  also an ee country , sharing a lot of history , etc. 
  it 's not a millennium of history , it 's the last ~ 50 years that influence it . 
  besides , poland was almost never attacked for religious reasons ( the exception could be the turks ) . 
   `` church rules poland '' is a fairy tale . 
  `` church rules poland '' is not a fairy tale , is just an over-simplification . 
  if you prefer `` the morals and values of the catholic church are ( much ) more present and influential in the polish society than in other countries in the geographic region , countries with similar cultural background or frequent trading partners '' . 
  ~ 100 out of 300 is ~ 1/3 , still `` much higher '' than ~ 1/10 . 
  in fact , 3 times as high . 
  i 'd like to see some official statistics ( if they exist ) , but my gut feeling is that poland is still * much * more religious than the west . 
  said in other words , in poland the average person is a `` nonpracticing christian '' , while in other countries it 's an agnostic/atheist . 
   despite all this everybody will still say we are catholic hub of stuck up conservative dimwits , sadly it 's usually some other pole . 
  which , compared to `` western europe '' is true . 
  so , `` relatively true '' . 
  look at abortion , gay marriage , marijuana legalization , or other `` progressive issues '' and you 'll see that poles are still pretty conservative . 
  i grew up in spain an maybe 1 out of 30 of my friends would go to church , maybe 1 in 10 on big holidays like christmas . 
  in poland those numbers are * much * higher , even among young people . 
  bank germany and alp germany . 
  only swamp germany failed this time ... 
  obviously , everyone knows it never rains in spain ...

  ok , now let 's do the analysis for poland ... , 
  welcome to the internet , you 're going to ~ ~ like ~ ~ * hate * it . 
  fair point .

  you make it sound like 3,9 is completely fine . 
  that 3,9 puts the us 108th out of 218 countries ( and excluding puerto rico , which is 200th ) . 
   statistically a german is twice as likely to kill himself than an american is to be killed by someone else . 
  statistically a german is one quarter as likely to be killed by someone else than an american is to be killed by someone else . 
  or statistically an american is almost six times as likely to be killed by someone else than a pole is to be killed by someone else . 
  ( poland has 99 problems but murder ai n't one , yay ! ), 
  which , iirc , are 300 % more probable/effective if the person has a gun .

  many countries in europe ( and some north america ) wish they had * just one * level-headed , sensible candidate . 
  and here comes overachiever germany with two . 
  * wags fist at cloud *, 
  a swiss guy defending neutrality , what a surprise :p, 
  that did n't happen and if it did , it was n't that bad and if it was , they asked for it and if they did n't , it was n't our fault or something like that ... 
  this is trump level reasoning . 
  - we had ~ ~ control of congress and senate ~ ~ overwhelming numerical and technological superiority - we lost a lot of men - we did n't achieve our objectives therefore : we won . 
  what ? 
  interesting , does the pub get paid for `` renting '' the premises for the day ? 
   to determine who is ** most people ** amongst their ranks as opposed to a dog in sunglasses and a hat ? 
   ( * popular * ? ), 
  marijuana : not even once .

  a joke candidate , polling high because people want to signal `` we 're tired of bullshit '' and do something outrageous in the polls , but will never be a serious contender . 
  the hair . 
  the catchphrases . 
  the constant insulting and plain trolling . 
  seriously looks like slapstick parody of a politician .
