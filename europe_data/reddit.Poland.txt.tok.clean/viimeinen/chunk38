  there 's just no way he will have any chance against a serious candidate . 
  anyhow , seems like the gop has little chance of winning in 2016 , barring any major democrat gaffe .

  they worked on me !, 
  next time in the us i will definitely try to visit cleveland , if only for the lols . 
  for current polan jokes : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f3sq3/map_of_which_countries_get_made_fun_of_the_most/, 
  [ i * really * want to visit cleveland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmla5tqbiy ) . 
  the main reason being [ it 's not detroit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozzgajjuqzm ) , of course  i had pierogies in pittsburgh , btw . 
  they were deep-fried . 
  i was confused . 
  south-east , but we did n't stop at any big city . 
  we drove from pittsburgh to lexington ( lexington being the farthest west we got ) . 
  we did not go trough columbus/cincinnati , we took some secondary roads . 
  iirc we took us22 and then 62 south . 
  it was really nice . 
  we wanted to see exactly that , how real america/americans look like . 
  we only got lectured about freedom once ( yep , literally ) and it was in that area , during a fishing trip on the finger lakes . 
  the vast majority of people seemed ( unsurprisingly ) normal . 
  we were surprised however about the amount of flags . 
  there were many houses along minor roads that were totally * littered * with american flags . 
  i 'm not talking a flag pole on you front yard , i 'm talking about a mini-flag every foot of fence , garlands on the roof , hangers on the porch and stickers on the windows . 
  and a flag pole on the front yard . 
  that kind of did live up to the stereotype :d, 
  boston -  ohio -  south carolina -  maine -  boston road trip , stopping whenever we felt like to explore random spots . 
  i still have my warsaw , ny sweatshirt :d, 
  i visited again in early april - what a difference . 
  great weather , beautiful cherry blossoms . 
  they should just evacuate the city come summer . 
  version numbers are not floats , they 're strings :p as in `` linux 4.1.2 '' ( sometimes even more ` points ' ), 
  apparently i ca n't read ... 
  when speaking english i always say `` point '' , cause that 's what i 've always heard . 
  in polish `` one comma five '' ( jeden przecinek pi\u0119c ) . 
  interestingly , polish has a name for the specific case of 1.5 ( p\u00f3\u0142tora ) . 
  in spanish `` one comma five '' ( uno coma cinco ) or `` one with five '' ( uno con cinco ) . 
  in german `` one comma five '' ( eins komma f\u00fcnf ) . 
  sure , but saying `` i liked this fancy restaurant in nyc/sf/coast of maine '' is not really something * american * specific ... there are fancy restaurants all over the world and they are usually all good  that being said , japanese food in sf was the best one i 've ever tried ( have n't been to japan ) . 
  also , steak was pretty awesome everywhere i tried it . 
  burgers too ( i mean real burgers , not mcdonalds ) . 
  edit : forgot ny cheescake from rocco 's in the village . 
  best . 
  cake . 
  ever . 
  come to the ~ ~ dark side ~ ~ * metric system * !, 
  we have cookies ... ( in multiples of 10 ! ), 
  so much stuff : - cheap * everything * , especially outside of nyc/sf . 
  pringles cans for $ 1 ( 2.5 $ in germany ) . 
  gallon of hawaii punch/arizona sweet tea for $ 1 - $ 2 . 
  dinner for $ 10 . 
  laptops , phones , ebooks for 70 % of the german price . 
  one night in a motel for 4 people for $ 50 . 
  do n't even start me on gas prices ... - restaurants : taco bell ( yes , seriously ) , applebee 's , hooters , cheesecake factory , dennys , `` 50s '' diners ... 
  i did n't mind the tipping ( you get much more attentive service ) . 
  - food : philly cheese steaks , ny pizza , garbage plate , boston/sf clam chowder , maine lobster/crab cake , burger and shakes , steaks , ... - strip malls everywhere . 
  full of restaurants , motels and walmarts . 
  - walmart . 
  people of walmart . 
  products of walmart . 
  gun section of walmart . 
  going to the us and not visiting walmart is missing half the fun . 
  - everything is big . 
  the cars are big ( and surprisingly small inside ) . 
  the appliances ( oven , fridge ) are ridiculously big . 
  shampoo : 1l bottle . 
  milk : 1 gallon jug . 
  ice cream : 1 gallon bucket . 
  ground beef : one pound pack . 
  all this explains the size of the fridges , too . 
  mcdonalds : the smallest us soda is the biggest european soda ( 0.4 l ) . 
  - speaking of mcdonalds : free refills , everywhere . 
  - friendly people . 
  if you 're just waiting somewhere people will strike up a casual conversation ( especially if you 're a tourist ) . 
  - ac set on `` arctic circle '' everywhere . 
  dc in july is not a fun place to be without it . 
  - wild nature . 
  even new york state has some stunning sites ( letchworth state park is quite spectacular ) . 
  further west and you 're reading `` caution : bears '' . 
  - nyc . 
  it 's just awesome , every corner of it . 
  ca n't get enough . 
  - pittsburgh , super friendly and `` cozy '' city . 
  - google hq in mountain view . 
  surreal . 
  what i did n't like : - fahrenheit . 
  fuck that noise . 
  i did n't have problems with miles , pounds and gallons after the first day . 
  but fahrenheit is just impossible . 
  - root beer . 
  seriously , wtf america ? 
  you 're not supposed to swallow your mouthwash !, 
  ps : adding an ice cream float does * not * help . 
  - dc in july , anywhere outside . 
  swamp heat ( 101f ) , humidity and mosquitoes everywhere . 
  we slept at a camping site . 
  0/10 would not recommend . 
  - atlantic city . 
  full of old people in pajamas playing slots . 
  - tax not included . 
  this is a brain-dead concept . 
  i 'm not interested how much money the shop gets , i want to know how much i have to pay . 
  and i ca n't do 8.875 % in my head .
