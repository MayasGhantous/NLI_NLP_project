  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrimination  besides , this whole discussion started with some paranoid whineing about the elected president while the previous one and their goverment did n't done nothing [ ok , one more time !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom )  deamands of homosexuals how dare they `` deamand '' equality !!, 
  they must think they 're human beings or something !, 
  the nerve !, 
   and left extremists ??? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non_sequitur_%28logic%29  so , what 's going to change in this matter ? 
  nothing . 
  same thing what changed geocentrism , creationism , slavery , segregation , women 's suffrage and many other primitive customs and believes : when people like you die out . 
  or emigration to a more tolerant and civilized country . 
   ffs you started it and i really do n't want to continue conversation on this `` level '' . 
  and gay people really want to marry . 
  it 's a tough world out there ... 
   extreme ? 
  yep , extreme . 
   i 've changed no position and still we 're discussing your accusations of `` discriminating '' homosexuals . 
  accusations ? 
  try `` facts '' . 
   why just two and why adults ? 
  this is going to be my new tag for you on res . 
  this is perfect . 
  thank you !, 
   there 'll be always `` discriminated '' people if you grant privillages to selected groups of people . 
  and you still are surprised that i say you use strawman arguments ? 
  really ? 
   i 've said it already , the state should n't organise any marriages or relationships between the people . 
  yet the following sentence is :  i 've said just that there 's at least some reason to sanction the relationships between heterosexual people becouse of the kids . 
  so contradiction . 
  in two succesive sentences . 
  nice . 
  on topthat , a super-weak argument , since old people and infertile people and people that just do n't want kids can still get married , as long as they are of different genders . 
   again this drama ... no drama , pure facts . 
   there 's no discrimination or abuse allowed ok , i 'll link it a third time , just for you : pis asked for an [ opt-out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) to be able to prevent homosexuals from getting married . 
  not only it 's allowed , it 's actively being seeked and encouraged . 
   it 's only that the heterosexual couples can sanction their relationships which gives them both , privillages and responsibilites . 
  which is exactly the definition of discrimination !, 
  here , read up : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrimination  ... i could say that you 'd like ernst rohm , but that would be the same retarded `` argument '' . 
  you lose : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law . 
   first of all , calm down . 
  first of all , i do n't need to . 
   secondly , a strawman is something else than misundarstanding and i 'm afraid that 's the case here . 
  nope , pretty textbook strawman : change the position to an extreme , fight that instead of the original argument . 
  clear strawman . 
   you still ca n't understand that not everybody is homo or heterosexual and that 's no `` equality '' when you give privillages just to these people . 
  i never said that * only * this or that people should be married . 
  please , please do n't change my words . 
  please . 
   we have been over this and you still do n't get that the others would be still `` discriminated '' . 
  i said ** any two consenting adults ** should be able to be married . 
  pis ( and apparently you defend them ) say that ** only heterosexuals ** should be able to get married . 
  --  why irony ? 
  well ...  defends discrimination and abuse of homosexuals  says something is `` disrespectful to these who were really discriminated and abused '' --  p.s. 
  i have no idea about america . 
  you 'll like him . 
   and the leftys wants to tell you that you can marry few more persons , while the rest ca n't do so and it 's supposed to be `` equality '' . 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  you probably should check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strawman . 
   the marriage serves mostly the security of women and children , it 's rational and i can understand this privillage even if it 's `` unequal '' and even if i think it should n't be granted to anybody . 
  and tampons are only useful for women yet men are not forbidden from buying them . 
  / s  britain and several other eu members also refused to sign this charter . 
  britain refused it to avoid widening strike rights , which is also bad and they should be ashamed . 
  no other country has refused , please do n't make stuff up . 
   what `` discrimiantion '' ? 
  we have been over this : refusing to allow them to marry , with all the legal consequences : family , adoption , pensions , inheritance , taxes ...  i tell you once again that it 's all about giving privillages to the other group of people , not to everybody . 
  and i tell you one again : that is discrimination . 
  should i copy paste my previous comment or can you find it yourself ? 
   you mentioned the `` gas chambers '' for obvious reason yes , as a ** counterexample ** . 
   this kind of fake martyrology is not just ridiculous 1 . 
  there is no fake martyrology , in fact there is no martyrology of any kind . 
  what is ridiculous is basing the law of a country on a book about ghosts written 2000 years ago . 
   also disrespectful to these who were really discriminated and abused . 
  oh , ** the irony ** !, 
  ps : you would like this guy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/todd_akin, 
   personally i do n't think that the state should organise marriages or any other kind of relationships between the adult people . 
  that is exactly what pis wants to do : tell you who you can and who you ca n't marry . 
  and as i said before they are so serious about it that they have asked for an [ opt-out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) to allow them to keep discriminating homosexuals and deny them the freedom of marrying whatever consenting adult they want . 
   do n't use holocaust as an argument ... 
  i 'm not used to insult or bash the people , you should n't feel offended just becouse i think you 're making a drama . 
  learn to read and do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i have ** never ** mentioned the holocaust . 
   i 'm glad that we agree , selected groups of people should n't be given benefits just becouse of their nature . 
  if anybody should be helped , these are handicaped people and minors . 
  exactly . 
  heterosexuals ( selected group of people ) should n't be given the * exclusive * option to marry ( benefit ) just because they like to fuck the opposite sex ( their nature ) . 
  glad we agree . 
   do n't be a drama queen . 
  do n't use ad-hominem . 
  it was a joke ... : /, 
  * this * is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  giving benefits based on gender , skin color , religion or sexual preference is the ** definition ** of discrimination . 
  the mentality `` as long as we do n't put the in gas chambers/beat them on the street it 's ok '' is not the one to be applied here . 
  it 's right there :  poland 's then ruling party , law and justice , mainly noted concerns that it might force poland to grant homosexual couples the same kind of benefits which heterosexual couples enjoy here 's what kaczy\u0144ski said :  chodzi np . 
  source for what ? 
  do you see the link in my post ? 
  gays in particular . 
  pis already asked for an [ opt-out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) to allow discriminating homosexuals in poland . 
  if they get sejm power they will go full retard and i would n't be surprised if they make some anti-gay law like putin . 
  the whole in-vitro thing has me flabbergasted : how is this even discussed ? 
  those two things are not related . 
  you do n't have to miss the coalition to be concerned about minority rights without being paranoid . 
   it came to the point where no one is going to do their job , even though in perspective it could bring more money than stealing .
