  that requires some serious dedication to your ideals !, 
  any proof that he speaks english and/or german ? 
  i could n't find any video on youtube of him speaking either . 
  even in the european parliament he speaks polish : /, 
  that 's an overstatement . 
  some of those concerns are very valid . 
  if pis wins the sejm as well , some people will have a rough few years ahead of them . 
  holy fuck that bill is scary . 
  but the whole situation is fucked up , so i guess they all deserve one another . 
  no it 's not . 
  other countries are the exact opposite : see germany and merkel staying in power by avoiding taking any decisions in polemic subjects . 
  serious answer : they are independent concepts from each other . 
  in this case his party ( pis ) is more pro-us and giving russia the finger where po is more pro-eu and trying to `` normalize '' relations with russia . 
  i would n't say any party is `` leaning towards '' russia , but this one is leaning even further away from russia . 
  of course the netherlands has regions !, 
  that has to be the worst english i have ever heard from scandinavian people . 
  usually all nordics have impaccable accents ... 
  and if they have , they are no true scotsman !, 
  they have a lot of people that say a lot of shit , pablo iglesias himself was saying he would `` implement censorship to protect free speech '' . 
  the people who join , however , are from all kinds of leanings and the party `` officially '' supports the anti-biparty system line . 
  nothing like a ~ ~ german ~ ~ * swede * to ruin a perfectly good joke :(, 
  room maybe . 
  but grenades , you 're running out of . 
  well , it 's more anti-establishment rather than far-left . 
  more along the lines of anti-corruption , anti-imperialism , pro-democracy and pro-human-rights . 
  things that putin is ( seems to be ) all against . 
  mail slot then ? 
  / u/cheesemakerthing did a good job , i 'll post my version : * is n't * that the truth , * though * ? 
  all over europe you 're * going to * find these * blokes * ( * postmen * , * solicitors * , etc ) , using * aluminium * * lifts * to go to the * car park * to their * van * , eating * packets * of * crisps * on the way to buy * petrol * ( avoiding the * tube * or the * train * , * single * tickets are expensive ) and clean the * windscreen * . 
  they cross the * neighbourhood * to the * shop * in the * centre * , buy some * maize tins * , * sweets * and * chips * and go back * through * the * toll motorway * , unless there 's a * diversion * . 
  they get their * items * from the * boot * , cross the * pavement * and check their * postboxes * . 
  they enter their homes on the * ground floor * and they take out the * rubbish * ( separated by * colours * ) to the * bins * outside . 
  only then can they sit on their * sofas * and watch * telly * . 
  good day sir !, 
  i watched the video . 
  not recommend . 
  poland : ** eastern poland ** : poor , catholic , uneducated rednecks . 
  ^ pls ^ invest . 
  ** warsaw ** : self-important pricks . 
  ** krak\u00f3w ** : self-important pricks that hate warsaw for being self-important pricks . 
  ** upper silesia ** ( g\u00f3rale , moutain people ) : warm , welcoming , good-humored people that ca n't speak proper polish if their lives depended on it . 
  ^ pls ^ do n't ^ downvote , * ^ jo ^ wos ^ lubia , ^ to ^ by\u0142 ^ ino ^ wic * ^ !, 
  no idea where they came from or what they speak . 
  ** western poland ** : graceless boring european-wannabees . 
  next time misspell some words so google translate has a harder time :p, 
  obviously the solution is to give ~ ~ the teachers ~ ~ ~ ~ barkeeps ~ ~ * social workers * more grenades . 
  [ this british fellow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fvsmu/new_5_euro_coin_coming_2016_german_article/ctszlrv ) did n't even know detour . 
  i bet `` diversion '' is how the queen prefers it  mailbox -  postbox neighborhood -  neighbo ** u ** rhood, 
  a couple more : ** lepe ** ( town in andalucia ) : butt of all `` dumb guy '' jokes . 
  ** cadiz ** ( city in andalucia ) : funny and outgoing people , because of the carnaval . 
  ** madrid ** : stuck up . 
  can not pronounce their own city ( madriz ) ** baleares ** : german by now . 
  ** zaragoza ** : kind of brute / always yelling . 
  what 's the only word in spanish that has an accent on all vowels ? 
  z\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00f3z\u00e1 !, 
  ** benidorm ** : cheap vacations and dirty beaches full of pensioners ( imserso ) . 
  ** marbella ** : expensive vacations and dirty beaches full of rich people ( celebrities and arabian kings ) . 
  ** extremadura ** : nothing but sadness and tears . 
  ** ciudad real ** : airports for 10.000 $ . 
  ** valencia ** : full of * canis * ( chavs/lads/jersey shore ) ** teruel ** : does n't exist . 
  poland # 1 !, 
  leading the world for once !, 
  / s edit : but spain trusts putin even less than poland !, 
  and both less than ukraine !, 
  fun fact : in russia there is no santa claus , the guy who brings presents on christmas * is [ grandpa frost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ded_moroz ) . 
  ^ ^ * christmas ^ ^ is ^ ^ of ^ ^ course ^ ^ 2 ^ ^ weeks ^ ^ later ^ ^ because ^ ^ orthodox, 
  probably a psoe-podemos would be the best result ( 40 % votes , probably enough for 50 % of pms ) . 
  podemos alone could be bad , as they lack experience and they could do something like syriza in greece . 
  spain definitely needs a true coalition government , something that has never happened ( ciu and pnv do n't count as coalition members ) . 
  again ? 
  was there a discount on grenades in ikea ? 
  the problem is the availability of study material , for me mostly movies and shows with ( word-for-word ) subtitles . 
  trivial for english , difficult for german , impossible for bavarian . 
  another reason not to adopt it then :p, 
   careful you could have lost a few million dong there . 
  man , i 'd worry if i lost just one ... 
  how do you light your cigars ? 
   all the people referring to notes as ` bills ' makes my poor rosbif stomach queasy let me copy paste you my earlier comment :  * ai n't * that the truth , * tho * ? 
  all over europe you 're * gon na * find these * dudes * ( * mailmen * , * attorneys * , etc ) , using * aluminum * * elevators * to go to the * parking lot * to their * truck * , eating * bags * of * chips * on the way to buy * gas * ( avoiding the * subway * or the * railroad * , * one-way * tickets are expensive ) and clean the * windshield * . 
  they cross the * neighborhood * to the * store * in the * center * , buy some * canned corn * , * candy * and * fries * and go back * thru * the * turnpike * , unless there 's a * detour * . 
  they get their * stuff * from the * trunk * , cross the * sidewalk * and check their * mailboxes * . 
  they enter their homes on the * first floor * and they take out the * garbage * ( separated by * colors * ) to the * trashcans * outside . 
  only then can they sit on their * couches * and watch * tv * . 
   how dare they !,

  good day sir !, 
  bavaria is awesome , lots of jobs , biergartens and alps . 
  i 'm glad the preissn have changed the official language tho , i think that mingarisch would be somehow more difficult to learn ,
