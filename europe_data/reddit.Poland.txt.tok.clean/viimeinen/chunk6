  damn , i must get out of minga from time to time ... 
  it 's one of the easiest to fix tho . 
  just ... `` make it so '' . 
  unemployment , immigration , all those need complex solutions that take time and adjusting to work . 
  damn reddit , you tricked me !, 
   the fact that a sizable portion of poles think other countries want to blame them for the holocaust shows just how big this disconnect actually is . 
  i do n't think anyone in poland thinks that `` countries * want * to blame them '' . 
  i do n't believe that , at least . 
  what * does * happen is people are ignorant , find out that auschwitz is near krak\u00f3w and call it `` polish concentration camp '' . 
  i believe it 's just an `` innocent '' mistake , but a mistake we can not let unchecked . 
  edit : also depends on what do you understand by `` sizable portion '' , if you mean 100 idiots then you might be right . 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ for ^ ^ the ^ ^ butchering, 
  til that the flair is associated to the comment , not the user . 
  you previous comment still has the french flair . 
  i think both the video and the website imply that is on the british side , although they do n't say it explicitly . 
  that 's what i understood from the beginning . 
  and given that the germans lost the battle of britain i suppose it would be true `` in general '' although i do n't have any data about it . 
  here 's the whole article :  ** 303 squadron **  the poles were keen to fight but the raf would not at first let them fly operationally . 
  this was because few of the exiles spoke english and there was concern about their morale . 
  what the british did not yet realise was that many of the poles were excellent pilots . 
  having come through the polish and french campaigns , they had more combat experience than most of their british comrades and they employed superior tactics . 
   as the battle of britain wore on , and the shortage of trained pilots became critical , the exiles were accepted into raf squadrons and two polish fighter units , nos . 
  302 and 303 squadrons , were formed . 
  once committed to action , the poles flew and fought superbly , shooting down 203 enemy aircraft for the loss of 29 pilots killed . 
  303 squadron became the most successful fighter command unit in the battle , shooting down 126 german machines in only 42 days . 
  czech sergeant josef frantisek , also of ' 303 ' , was the top scoring pilot with 17 confirmed victories . 
   air chief marshal sir hugh dowding , who led fighter command , would later write :  `` had it not been for the magnificent material contributed by the polish squadrons and their unsurpassed gallantry , i hesitate to say that the outcome of the battle would have been the same . '', 
  `` i bet that * przed wojn\u0105 ** the education was better '' ^ ^ * przed ^ ^ wojn\u0105 : ^ ^ `` before ^ ^ the ^ ^ war '' , ^ ^ common ^ ^ polish ^ ^ expression ^ ^ to ^ ^ glorify ^ ^ the ^ ^ interwar ^ ^ period . 
   also , i have never heard anyone calling them polish camps . 
  and the point is to keep it that way . 
  for those who do n't get the babo reference : http://www.thelocal.de/20131125/turkish-for-boss-is-best-german-youth-slang-2013, 
  it 's a word-play on `` i have n't noticed '' -  `` i have n't * merkled * '', 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  flair is irrelevant , the `` cavalry charge on tanks '' is soviet propaganda . 
  after some digging i found this : http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/the-polish-air-force-in-world-war-2/303-squadron.aspx  no . 
  303 squadron became ** the most successful fighter command unit in the battle , shooting down 126 german machines ** in only 42 days . 
  czech sergeant josef frantisek , also of ' 303 ' , was the top scoring pilot with 17 confirmed victories . 
  so as long as it 's talking about the battle of britain , it seems to be right . 
   after the end of world war ii , it was still used by ** soviet ** propaganda as an example of stupidity of pre-war polish commanders , who allegedly ** did not prepare their country for the war ** and instead ** wasted the blood of their soldiers ** . 
  oh , the irony ... 
  i found him extremely annoying but could n't see any `` borderline lies and fabrications '' or strawman arguments . 
  care to give some examples ? 
  edit for non-german-speakers : it 's a word-play on `` i have n't noticed '' -  `` i have n't * merkled * '',
