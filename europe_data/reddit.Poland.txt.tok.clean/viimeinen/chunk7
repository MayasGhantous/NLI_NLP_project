  hmmmm ... / r/europe downvotes the weirdest things : /, 
  how often do you eat [ h\u00e1karl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a1karl ) ? 
  what proportion of the population likes it ? 
   and what 's a `` hooligan '' style ? 
  flares , mostly . 
  the whole `` celebratory '' vibe . 
  it should be `` paying respect '' imo . 
   are you going to forbid the people to celebrate it the way they wants when they do no harm to anybody ? 
  no , and i do n't think i ever suggested that . 
  i just expressed my opinion . 
  let 's not overreact . 
   inappropriate way would be to leave it just for politicians , especially those who condemned or ignored it during communism and after . 
  sure or by killing puppies , or any number of inappropriate things that i did n't menton ... 
  ok , i was wrong ... 
  but my statement is still * technically * true ( best kind of true ) , germany has refused ( in the past ) to sell weapons to sa . 
  they have now decided to re-start the trade as isis surges ( whether sincere or merely an exuse is to be determined ) . 
  `` colega '' , calm down , i 'm pretty sure / u/aliceinwurstland was just kidding ... 
  the report says that the man treated the police `` in a despective and inconsiderate way , including the use of the word ` colega ' , in the presence of pedestrians '' . 
  they * could * argue that there were other factors besides the word itself and the law unfortunately would protect the policeman . 
  the best chance he has is to take it to court , then to a higher court , and hope that the slowness of the process will drag the lawsuit long enough to have the winner of the next elections repeal the law . 
  here , you dropped this : \u00bf, 
  all in all , it is fair to say that there are two plurals . 
  the rules behind it are what they are , but there are two plurals , 
  i like much more the `` minute of silence '' way of remembering . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejd2rsxoqsi hooligan-style celebration is definitely not the appropriate way for this ... 
  germany has refused to sell weapons to saudi arabia . 
   that nobody ever got any problems following those bombardments might seem a little unfair to some eyes . 
  sure , fuckups happen . 
  and the people responsible should be judged . 
  the thing is , no matter how tragic civilian casualties are , they are not * genocide * . 
  it sounds to me like they are defending genocide by comparing it to the bombings : /, 
  i would . 
  that one seems pretty solid fault of the polish government . 
  fuckup fest by incompetent officials like no other . 
  you wo n't * believe * what putin did now !, 
  only if you 're spanish !, 
  have you learnt nothing ? 
  care to expand ? 
  what were his arguments ? 
   and putting all the blame on serbia in the international court in the hague afterwards . 
  who else was to blame ? 
  it 's not like they can speak belgian , you know ... 
  well ... kurwa . 
  is that a thing in dutch ? 
  kind of a cruel insult xd, 
  it 's not very effective :p i feel like a 6 year old reading cyrillic , letter by letter to make the sound of a word . 
   you 're just a complete asshole this is exactly the kind of behavior i was trying to prevent . 
  it is clear we can not have a rational discussion on this topic , for some reason . 
  i hope you relieved some stress insulting a stranger on the internet and wish you a pleasant weekend . 
  you seem to be somehow offended by my suggestion of the system not being perfect . 
  i wo n't even try to point out the flaws in your reasoning , not interested in a flame . 
  have a good night . 
  worked the other way as well . 
  hearing the irish sing the fields of athenry vs spain was one of the highlights of the euro . 
   why is it unsettling ? 
  you 're our friends , not our enemies . 
  it 's unsettling that someone can carry a rifle on a commercial flight just showing some documentation . 
  i 'm worried about : - mentally unstable individuals with proper permits : ptsd veteran going back home , snapping mid-flight . 
  - malicious groups forging documents . 
  since ammo is not allowed the risk is much lower , tho . 
  i 'm not sure how much more effective a rifle is compared to any other blunt object on the plane ... 
  that 's kind of unsettling . 
  what about the ammo ? 
  i am sure they are funny in czech . 
  ^ ^ everthing ^ is ^ funny ^ in ^ czech, 
  `` with us '' : checked or carry-on ? 
  vienna is the capital of austria . 
  just go to the nearest zoo , set some kangaroos free ( hey , freedom ! ), 
  and follow them . 
  ca n't miss it . 
  woosh !, 
  how about we learn to take jokes as jokes and not overreact ? 
  there is a [ comment just above this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f65ls/british_journalist_kitty_logan_from_sky_news_asks/ctlmk8k ) that makes a similar joke and nobody loses their mind . 
  the headline is misleading tho . 
  facebook loses battle over * publishing id info * , not over * fake names * ... 
  pro tip : double the \\ to avoid armless guys : \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
   not as a nickname , but a comparison . 
  ok , that sure . 
  in poland it would be scots , like in hungary . 
  ( your original comment suggested a nickname ) . 
   because facebook is specifically asking to publish and store data from the id , that is illegal . 
  this is the piece of data i was missing . 
  now it makes sense . 
  i just thought they are doing plain identity verification . 
  * triggered *, 
  some bilba\u00ednos are from lepe , too . 
  do n't you own towels ? 
  you pay attention to the weirdest things ... 
  looking at the reactions , i 'd say `` too soon '' . 
  so you concede that the irish are superior ?
