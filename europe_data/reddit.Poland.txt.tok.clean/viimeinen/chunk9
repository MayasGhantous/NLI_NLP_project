  relevant part ( bold mine ) :  after the law went into effect , the spanish association of publishers of periodical publications ( aeepp ) commissioned an economic study about the impact of the new spanish ancillary copyright law -- and found ( not surprisingly ) that ** the legal change ( and the shuttering of google news and other aggregators ) was absolutely harmful to the spanish news media and innovation in general ** . 
  it also found strong evidence that , contrary to what those fighting against google news have claimed , ** aggregators expand the market for the original sources , rather than shrink it by acting as a substitute ** . 
  the latter is based on a `` study of studies '' basically , looking at all of the academic literature in terms of the impact of aggregators -- all of which shows that it increases the overall size of the market , rather than shrinks it . 
   however , the really telling part of the report is that ** this law that was passed in the name of helping news publications , ended up doing tremendous harm to many online publications ** -- especially smaller sites that frequently ( and happily ) relied on google news and other aggregators for a significant amount of traffic . 
  well ... duh . 
  at least now there 's a formal study that confirms it . 
  they are not slackers , they just proved they are patrolling facebook * really * hard !, 
  thanks !,

    because one country does a lot of shady shit does n't mean another gets a free pass to do the same  it means . 
  either there is justice for all , or there is no justice at all .

   i understand the polish people 's distaste for anything even remotely associated with socialism .

  * eesti can into nordic !!, 
  ! 1 ! one * now serioulsy , i like the current estonia flag after reading that it represents the horizon on a winter day : white snow , black forest , blue sky . 
  i find it very quiet and calming . 
  * tips you for the reference *, 
   yeah , some random poll made by a newspaper centro de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e estudos de sociologia and universidad de salamanca  asking 200 people 848  it sure is representative of almost half of the portuguese population . 
  yes , with a 2.39 % error margin . 
  to be fair , spain probably wo n't be a monarchy * much * longer , unless felipe does a really flawless job . 
  the new generation is increasingly republican . 
   but sadly it has fascist connotations tell us more about the * current * flag of spain ... 
   you missed the bacon i * did * say hamburger ... 
  i think canada has one of the nicest flags in the world . 
  the union jack flags all look a bit ... colonial . 
  i would n't change the current flag . 
  your country is pretty neat and the flag is definitely a big plus .

  nothing like a german to ruin a good joke :p, 
  what if i just want to sing ... ? 
  at least she did n't ask for tree fiddy ... 
  i 'd love if some of the downvoters would explain why this is wrong , if at all ... 
   what do you mean ? 
  de-criminalize use of drugs , instead of fighting police trying to enforce the law . 
   how am i supposed to prove anything i have experienced ? 
  news stories , statistics ...  this is like exactly from one of those edward snowden documentaries . 
  you do n't live in your car . 
  people know that the roads are not private . 
  you do n't drive on `` your '' road . 
  but here we are talking about a concept that follows you forever . 
  the cops have a `` forever right '' to take samples from your body , whenever they `` have the impression '' that you are `` on drugs '' . 
  that means 24/7 , not just when you are driving in your car , it means that you might need an extra hour for that meeting , it means that your family dinner got spoiled because you could n't urinate and had to go downtown , it means that you had to explain to your kids why you had to be late and so forth . 
   you are using a non sequitor argument , dui has nothing to do with a drug test that does not apply to driving . 
  it is a test that aims to control what the citizens are doing , and it works on fear . 
  again , if you legislate about people 's bodies you can not then leave the police unable to enforce those laws ... 
  that was epic . 
  * [ hamburger music starts playing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsjj_pdjys ) *, 
   but when your own body is under surveillance under all circumstances , then you are in affect under totalitarian law . 
  the law you should be fighting is the one that puts your body under surveillance , not the one that allows to enforce the surveillance . 
   such as family dinners or regular saturday afternoons in the park . 
  i find this hard to believe . 
  source ? 
   i really hope you will be forced to take a drug test when you are in a hurry to something important , just once so you can grasp a tiny glimpse of what i am trying to say . 
  again , does n't seem to be much worse from a traffic stop when you are in a hurry ... you 're going to be late and there 's nothing you can do about it . 
  not a reason to abolish traffic stops ... 
  it 's hard to argue with people who are not russia 's neighbors , they do n't even understand the concept of russification :(, 
  i absolutely oppose mass surveillance . 
   why do you condone the cops to whenever they feel like to take samples from your urine or blood ? 
  not `` whenever they feel like '' , when they suspect drug use . 
  and i support it cause it 's not `` mass '' , it 's targeted to one specific suspect . 
  just because it could be abused by a corrupt/jackass policeman does n't mean that it should n't be available for the instances it 's needed . 
  just provide the tools to avoid/report abuse . 
  it 's the same as drunk driving . 
  if you suspect a driver , you test him , because drunk driving is illegal . 
  if drug usage is forbidden , police should have to tools to test for it .
