dat description :  this propaganda is not true . 
  that footage was taken in the uk, 
  is it this one ? 
  http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/humaninterest/why-no-irish-need-apply-202586.html and on the other hand , what is the general sentiment when it comes to employing poles in ireland ? 
  my family in cork does n't watch irish media , so their accounts are purely anecdotal . 
  [ no irish need apply ] ( http://historymyths.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/thumbnail-1-aspx1.jpeg ), 
  romanians are orthodox , but regardless i think their high religiosity is for similar causes to poles . 
  my bet is that they will finally accept `` black '' as a word , but they 'll change its spelling to `` blaque '' . 
  the * h * does n't exist in modern greek any more . 
  [ it was written using a diacritic in ancient greek . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rough_breathing ), 
  i think that the dissolution of austria-hungary into its constituent countries counts as both * de facto * and * de jure * cancellation of the partitions . 
  it was n't an equally easy and equally legal process for all the nations , but in case of poland it went pretty smoothly . 
  emperor charles i signed a manifesto on 16th october 1918 essentially releasing the kingdom of galicia and lodomeria from the empire , while still trying to tie the remaining cisleithanian states into a federation . 
  the southern border of galicia became the southern border of the second polish republic . 
  honestly , i have no idea . 
  i do n't know much about korea or about psychology . 
  there may be someone else who can help . 
  well , this is actually quite an important thing , way more important that the fact that you 're korean : acceptance for trangender people varies . 
  most people do n't care if your white , yellow , brown , black , or blue , but transgender may evoke some reactions . 
  i 'd recommend you stick to larger cities in western europe and do n't assume everyone will accept you as you are . 
  it should still be better than most of the world , but it 's not 100 % without problems . 
  edit : i found this : http://i.imgur.com/cuxlrk1.png source : www.scp.nl/english/dsresource?objectid=34190&amp;type=org, 
  poland has a sizeable vietnamese minority . 
  there are many japanese people living in my city . 
  everything is fine . 
   europeans will gun you this is n't ` murica , people are n't walking around with guns . 
   you will never even get a job in europe so suck it up well , economy is n't in the best shape recently , and i doubt you are going to want to be as cheap as other immigrants . 
  but racial profiling against koreans and japanese practically does n't exist . 
   are there any ways to look more western via plastic surgery or makeup ? 
  [ i recommend this .

  the song was posted next to the first occurrence ( or one of the first ) of the remove kebab copypasta . 
  cheap and good wine . 
   liberated europe lol, 
  west slavic languages have fixed stress , in case of czech and slovak it 's on the first syllable , in case of polish it 's on the penultimate . 
  east and south slavic languages can have stress anywhere , and sometimes words differ only by stress location , like in the word [ \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%ba#russian ) ( its polish equivalent * zamek * is pronounced the same regardless of meaning ) . 
  it 's because it 's descendant of old east slavic , the language used in the era of kievan rus , and it has many grammatical and phonetic features of eastern european languages : * stress on random syllables * verbs end with * - t * in third person * liquids are surrounded by vowels ( * - oro - * , * - olo - * , * - ere - * ) instead of only followed ( * - ro - * , * - lo - * , * - re - * ) and so on . 
  the distance between greek and german was simply not measured . 
  i think this graph would look way better if someone managed to measure distances between all pairs of the languages and arrange them properly . 
  are hungarians football fans doing the same , but with slovakia and transylvania ? 
  there were both kinds . 
  source : i had a few . 
  so bratislava sucks out all investments from neighbouring regions ? 
  have you seen * the day the immigrants left * ? 
  it 's exactly about this : 12 unemployed britons were given a low-level job and the film follows what happened later . 
  spoilers : it varied .

  just add `` fluent in urdu '' to the list of requirements . 
  usa needs to deploy 2 more warheads to get ahead . 
  this reminds me of a bit from irish radio i heard somewhere . 
  a lady called into the show and complained about poles receiving welfare in ireland . 
  he asked her if irish people should receive welfare in australia . 
  she unhesitatingly said yes . 
  he then tried to explain the sheer hypocrisy to her . 
   and there is no technical reason why people can not view and change their vote before a deadline , even view their vote afterward . 
  voting is supposed to be anonymous . 
  also , even ignoring that , you can rig that too : hack someone 's computer , make it display that the user voted x , send a vote for y. 
  when the results come around , no-one will notice anything any time soon . 
  [ so this is how the future will look like .

  neither the phone number . 
  i could just buy a used phone , get a prepaid sim card , make a phonecall with a bomb threat , and they 'd have to spend quite a bit of effort in order to figure out who was calling . 
  depending on the definition of europe . 
  in the times of the cold war , it was customary to treat soviet union as having european part and asian part , both mostly contiguous , with the border going through the ural mountains . 
  this way , azerbaijani ssr was in the european part . 
  geographically speaking , there are several variants of europe -- asia border : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/plik:transasia_m2.png i was taught at school the a variant , which makes azerbaijan 100 % asian , but i think f variant ( which the currently most common one ) makes more sense . 
  in most cases , most of azerbaijan is in asia . 
  it 's similar to turkey : similar language and culture , similar economic ties to europe , both on the intercontinental border . 
  that 's what olympics supporters claimed in krak\u00f3w . 
  it went something like this : \u201f olympics are a solution for smog . '' \u201f olympics are a solution for traffic jams . '' \u201f if we host olympics , the central goverment will have to give us money for infrastructure . '' people were n't that dumb though . 
  luxembourg is a grand duchy . 
  it 's not huge though . 
  sounds okay for me , at least as long as you do n't make puns . 
  oh look , germans and russians making deals over our heads again !, 
  fuck it , we 're joining whatever we want .

  it looks like transliterated from ukrainian - or russian-language source . 
  there is still matter of choosing between * flower of scotland * , * scotland the brave * , * highland cathedral * , * a man 's a man for a ' that * and * scots wha hae * . 
  you 're probably referring to * flower of scotland * , which indeed has the highest popular support and will most probably be the anthem if scotland votes yes . 
  it 's not like you had n't got ones that had better weather : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/couronian_colonization, 
  i 'd say ukraine . 
  for tv . 
  poland uses subtitles for most movies in cinema . 
  the map should have been changed to show what is used in tv and what is used in cinema . 
  i think the reasoning for that is that no emotions is better than badly done emotions . 
  we had hobbit both dubbed and subbed . 
  from what i 've seen in the trailers , dub was bad . 
  i kinda agree with you . 
  if there were hate-speech law against some kinds of prejudiced hate , but not against hate based on prejudice against sexuality , it would suck . 
  but if there are no hate-speech laws , everyone 's equal . 
  i said `` home '' , not `` house '' . 
  afaik they 're stuck in refugee camps , later they may get some small apartments . 
  which i hope they do , because winter is coming ...
