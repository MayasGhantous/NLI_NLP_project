  women also can decide to not have children , and if they have an `` accident '' they can abort it . 
  men can not abort pregnancies they caused . 
  of course there 's another gender-equal solution : ban on-demand abortion . 
  this way neither sex can weasel out of their responsibility . 
   this does mean that we often need subtitles to understand what people in our own country speaking `` the same language '' are saying . 
  that reminds me of this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj0g6bh0iqy, 
  will danish authorities come after people who say that ** mohammed basil el-cheikh tried to kill hedegaard ? 
  ** ## because if so , i would be careful about saying that ** mohammed basil el-cheikh tried to kill hedegaard . 
  `` i running from the army of alexander the great . '', 
  `` sir , you are fleeing straight into his homeland , this is macedonian-greek border . '', 
  breaking news : migrant claims to be 17 years old , is actually 3000, 
  you 're probably talking about people above 35 , so going to school in 80s and early 90s . 
  at that time , russian and german were two most commonly taught foreign languages , and afaik highschools had to teach at least two foreign languages . 
  german was viewed as the more useful one , so people learned it and used it . 
  russian -- not so much . 
  english did n't have enough teachers back then yet , the boom for english teachers had n't come yet by then . 
  also since you 're talking about people involved in international business relations -- it 's very likely that they 're over 35 and they also trade with germans . 
  and more than an equivalent syrian family , even if ignore transport costs . 
  my point is , it 's hard to compare the situation those migrants are ( refugees or not ) with the situation people from the eastern eu are . 
  and people often do . 
  the difference is that a pole : * is allowed to enter the country and get a job ; * often \\* speaks german ; * has more marketable skills ; * has closer home if he decides to go back . 
  the first one makes the most difference . 
  poles moving to germany often have a job arranged before leaving poland , they do n't have to look for it , and there 's practically no bureaucracy involved . 
  syrians wo n't get a legal job without an appropriate visa or getting the refugee status -- both of which may take ages in the current situation -- and even then , they would also need both language training and professional training . 
  ^ ( * for certain values of \u201f often '' ), 
  why google how europe is like when you can just watch a movie on tv or ask the smuggler ? 
  so they watched hostel and that 's why they do n't want to go to slovakia ? 
  britain is now safe 3 . 
  move money from zurich to london 4 . 
  switzerland no longer needed for hiding money 5 . 
  switzerland can join eu, 
  frankly speaking , it does n't surprise me . 
   with a one-way ticket home to iraq in his hands and seven months ' worth of ** frustration over intransigent german bureaucracy ** in his heart , gazwan abdulhasen abdulla gave up on his dreams of a better life in europe . 
  yet again yurop shows its strength . 
  for some reason it reminds me of the * 12 tasks of asterix * movie , where the hardest of all tasks was getting necessary paperwork to continue to the next task . 
  it seems that in 40 years nothing changed . 
  google maps is so nice that it displays most of names on that map in polish , which kinds beats the purpose . 
  it 's kinda hard to understand how szy\u0142okarczma or balwieryszki have germanic origin . 
  here 's a link with language forced to polish : https://www.google.com/maps/@54.6046875,24.2907719,9z?hl=pl on an unrelated note , i just noticed that google maps finally stopped translating salzburg to solnogr\u00f3d . 
  so that 's why hillary palin said she could see russia from her house . 
  my uncle lives with his family in ireland and my father talked with him over skype on christmas . 
  the conversation quickly derailed to the topic of the migrant crisis and here are some of the things my uncle said : * merkel is stupid for inviting so many muslims . 
  * ireland should n't take in any migrants . 
  * french police should clean up the mess in calais . 
  * he had to work for everything he got and they come in and get everything for free . 
  * muslims already in ireland are not integrated and abuse welfare . 
  * his hard-working ranking : ee immigrants , irish natives , muslims , blacks . 
  * irish people are clueless when it comes to the migrant crisis or fixing electric sockets . 
  * current migrants have unrealistic and outrageous demands . 
  he had arguments for those things , based on his observations of the multicultural working class in ireland , which according to him , are not something that the middle-class irish would notice on their own . 
  whether he was right , or not , it 's hard to tell . 
  it 's him who knows how ireland looks like , not me . 
  later , we talked with his son and his step-son , and they showed similar views , although it was n't a major topic of the conversation any more . 
  and then download another . 
  and never watch any of them , waste your time on random youtube videos instead . 
  that 's the category we 're competing with russians . 
  [ 5 out of 11 record blood alcohol contents on wikipedia are from poland . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_alcohol_content#highest_recorded_blood_alcohol_level.2fcontent ) there are probably some genetic reasons for this . 
  neither was syria . 
  you brought it up , instead of bringing up the more appropriate example . 
   create another shithole to buzz about , so people forget previous one . 
  congratulations , putin 's methods work : you forgot about georgia . 
  i think it 's the best for making short announcements and following other 's announcements , without all that social baggage facebook has . 
  it 's not designed for discussion or any meaningful social interactions . 
  the closest twitter has to these is people using username mentions to shout short sentences at each other and missing each other 's point -- since the point never fits in a single tweet . 
  which makes it perfect for drama -- if you want to join , there is n't a lot to read to catch up . 
  in case of polish-czech , polish-slovak and swedish-norwegian borders , it 's because the borders go along mountain tops . 
  water on the northern side of the tallest mountain usually flows north , on the southern side usually flows south . 
   i do n't see why that should change . 
  then should we go back to 12 hours , 6 days a week , like it was in the good ol' 19th century ? 
  i mean , people 150 years ago had the same biology , did n't they ? 
  antisemitism comes from jealousy . 
  beef is still cheaper . 
  and those refugees ca n't take a trip anywhere for cheap shopping , since it 's too far . 
  recently people from asylum centre in frankfurt an der oder started to show up in s\u0142ubice to buy cheap stuff in local stores and at the local market . 
  so far they 're more annoying than dangerous and several of them have already been apprehended and transported back to germany . 
  they ca n't do the same in denmark . 
  poland : germoney yuo ca n't build oil pipe to russkie germany : polen i will trade with whoever i will , also take soem refugees please ? 
  poland : no, 
  cs is worth it -- good salaries , lots of job offers , and in some cases even ability to work remotely for foreign employers . 
  i got $ 1000 gross straight after graduation -- granted , it was several years ago and in poland , not hungary . 
  of course it depends on how much you 're paying ; in poland the constitution guarantees free higher education and i went to a public university , so i paid jack shit . 
  this is average , by which they probably mean mean , and with distributions skewed like wages are , mean is higher than median . 
  this means most people earn less than average . 
  median is harder to calculate , that 's why it 's less commonly given . 
  the left allied itself with muslims , despite disagreeing on every single core value except for `` bash rich white man and take his money '' . 
  attacking jews as fiercely as described in the article is what they do for muslim support .

   refugees can become naturalised after two years residence in poland only if they speak polish on at least b1 level . 
   refugees have to specifically state that they want to be re-located to country x , otherwise they ca n't legally be made to move case in point : http://fakty.interia.pl/raporty/raport-imigranci-z-afryki/informacje/news-rmf24-rodzina-syryjskich-uchodzcow-odmowila-przyjazdu-do-pol,nid,2078142  a six-person family of syrian refugees , verified by polish officials in greece , refused to move to poland . 
  after they learnt that they are to be settled in our country , they withdrew , and other people were selected in their place . 
  of course we do more than just boiling . 
  we also make vodka .
