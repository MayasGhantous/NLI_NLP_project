   `` why we spell afrika with a ` k ' : before de arrival of european kkkolonialist , afrika was originally spelled with a ` k ' . 
  de continent gets its name from a brotha who was emperor of de ancient zingh empire over 15,000 years ago . 
  emperor tirus afrik is also responsible for placing de red , blak , and green flag all over de continent , this is how de continent came to be named after him . 
  it was n't until after de arrival of de italian general scipio africanus who conquered afrika for de italians many centuries later , that de hard ` k ' was replaced with de letter ` c ' . 
  so our spelling afrika with a ` k ' represents our conscious awareness of ourselves and our social development as a peepoe , and our conscious desire to once again come together in unity as one peepoe , one nation , with one destiny ; with one flag : red , blak , and green !

  however , if you let food prices rise to the point where people can no longer afford to buy food , then no matter how kind and loving you are , the people will rise up in protest . 
  most large-scale protests in communist poland started because of economic reasons : [ in 1956  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pozna%c5%84_1956_protests#strikes )  a spontaneous strike started at 6:00 am at the multifactory complex of joseph stalin 's ( or ` cegielski 's ) metal industries . 
  around 80 % of its workers , most of whom had lost bonus pay in june as the government suddenly raised the required work quota , took to the streets demanding pay compensation and some freedom concessions , marching towards the city centre . 
  [ in 1970  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_polish_protests )  in december 1970 the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs . 
  the rise in prices proved to be a major shock to ordinary citizens and turned the urban workers against the regime . 
  ( ... ) demonstrations against the price rises broke out in the northern baltic coastal cities of gda\u0144sk , gdynia , elbl\u0105g and szczecin . 
  [ and in 1980  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_solidarity#early_strikes_.281980.29 )  strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest , but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade . 
  in july 1980 , edward gierek 's government , facing economic crisis , decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages . 
  at once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations , with the biggest strikes taking place in the area of lublin .
