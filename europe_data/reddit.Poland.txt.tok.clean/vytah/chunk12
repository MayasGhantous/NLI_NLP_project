  first , three is n't all . 
  second , contents of a holy book do not define a religion . 
  a religion is a complex set of ideas , the book being only a part of it . 
  in fact , you can have a religion without any holy book , that 's how most of the pagan religions worked . 
  in short , what you suggest is some kind of censorship and restriction of free speech . 
  moral and legal uncertainities aside , you need to draw a line . 
  for example , if you want to ban promoting killing outside of self-defence , you 'll have to ban the fringiest of fringe judaist and christian sects , while banning quite more of islamic ones , and probably no mormon , jw or sikh ones . 
  in fact , inciting violence is already illegal in many western countries , it 's just some islamists use religious freedom as a defence . 
  restricting freedom of religion would be a move in the direction you want , and most european christians would n't be affected by it . 
  it would also mean more jehova witness kids saved by transfusions against their parents ' will . 
  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . 
   one of the attackers is confirmed to * have possessed a syrian passport * ftfy . 
  getting a fake syrian passport is easy . 
  refugees are not running away * from * terrorists , they 're running away * with * terrorists . 
  when wolf 's fur catches fire and the wolf tries to run away from it , all it does is spreading the fire . 
  what you should do , is to prevent the wolf from running around and * put the fire out * . 
  and you should n't necessarily blame the wolf for it . 
  nah , po was going to lose either way . 
  why ? 
  spain is too far west to be involved much in the refugee crisis , and it 's current muslim population is n't that high either . 
  this problem is of less concern for them than , for example , high unemployment . 
  and `` muslims conquered bits of southern europe for a while '' does n't count , since it was n't becoming a part of european society , but * replacing * european society . 
  dogs are n't , it would be haraam . 
   excusing behaviour by the refugee by pointing out that germans somehow are also bad this tactic was used by soviet union a lot : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes, 
   values like faith in one 's ability to adapt to difficult circumstances , or the perseverance to face extreme obstacles to bring your family to safety . 
  and the courage to start over in a new country where some portion of the population opposes your very existence . 
  those are not * values * , those are * skills * . 
  who gave her a diploma ? 
  the raft is only 0.4 m \u00b3 , so it displaces only 320 kg . 
  0.4 m \u00b3 of water is 400 kg , so you can add only 80 kg . 
  only one refugee can stay . 
   your example of m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n is weird since for me the acute is placed on the n instead of the j , but if i use a `` proper '' font it 's correctly displayed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verdana#combining_characters_bug  the font should do the proper substitutions automatically to remove the dot before adding the acute ### dot removal test : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; i\u0341 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; j\u0341 ### dotless test : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u0131\u0341 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u0237\u0301 ### combined glyph : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u00ed dot removal test : i\u0341 j\u0341 dotless test : \u0131\u0341 \u0237\u0301 combined glyph : \u00ed i just noticed that that dotless j does n't come from verdana , so it 's even more complicated . 
  text rendering is hard . 
  i used a dotless j , u +0237 . 
  i also remember \u00e8 , as in * bl\u00e8ren * or the interjection * h\u00e8 * , or many , many french loanwords . 
  i also looked for words with \u00e4 , and apart from some german loanwords , i only found * kana\u00e4n * , * ba\u00e4l * , * a\u00e4ron * , * iza\u00e4k * -- all biblical proper names . 
  i agree though that apart of loanwords and tremas , * \u00e9\u00e9n * seems to be the only consistently accented word . 
  as a curiosity : if you want to put an accent on * ij * , like for example in * mijn * , some typographical resources recommend putting the accent of both * i * and * j * , but most fonts do not support it , or support it poorly . 
  test : m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n * m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n *, 
  croatian \u0111 vs icelandic \u00f0 . 
  the former is just a * d * with a stroke , the latter has evolved so far it has to be considered a separate letter . 
  what about * v\u00f3\u00f3rkomen * vs * voork\u00f3men * ? 
  i think i also saw * d\u00e1\u00e1r * somewhere . 
  also , what about \u00f6 as in * co\u00f6peratie * ? 
  almost all facebook `` like '' buttons on various webpages are loaded from facebook 's servers . 
  usually , this lets facebook receive the referrer ( a site where the button was inserted ) and set an identifying cookie which can be used to track the visitor between all sites with such buttons ( since facebook in this case is third party , first being you and second being the website you visit , these cookies are called third-party cookies ) . 
  this way , facebook knows what pages a user identified by that cookie visits . 
  with a bit of luck , facebook could even figure out that user 's identity . 
  some browsers can block third-party cookies , and you can also use various browser addons to further limit requests sent to facebook during ordinary web browsing . 
  this is of course not limited to facebook : every button or ad loaded from third party 's server can be used for the same . 
   pole position all positions are pole positions . 
   germany has decided to not care whether someone has been registered elsewhere or not . 
  if that 's true , it 's going to fuck them pretty quickly , and also render any quotas meaningless . 
  [ that 's almost a thing .

  here in poland , a catholic charity brought several hundred syrian christians , mostly families , and accommodated them at parishes in good conditions . 
  pretty soon they headed west . 
  based on the same idea , you can blur your profile that your web search providers built of you : send randomised queries so your profile will look generic , targeted advertising wo n't work , and any interesting search query will get buried under hundreds of generic ones . 
  there 's an addon for that : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/trackmenot/ i used to use it . 
  google 's guess about my interests became totally incorrect . 
  it 's not . 
  you need to separate the `` all arab-looking people are muslims '' view ( which is racism ) from the `` all muslims are violent '' view ( which is islamophobia ) . 
  islam is not a race . 
  north latvia , south latvia . 
  it would work .

   the video bitrate is only about 4mbit/s for 720p and 7mbit/s for 1080p , so if true then they 're far from optimal . 
  what do you mean `` only '' ? 
  but they do n't use off-the-shelf encoders , [ they licensed an advanced video encoder ] ( https://gigaom.com/2012/02/01/eyeio-video-encoding-netflix/ ) . 
  is this thread related to the election results ? 
  not sure how well it applies to . nowoczesna , but here it is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_centrism, 
  no , they ca n't . 
  they 'd need to get at least kukiz and psl on board . 
   do n't expect much progress on gay rights and ivf . 
  given how po approached this subject , i think i 'd prefer a party that says `` no !, 
  and shut up ! '', 
  than a party that keeps saying `` maybe ... '' for several months and in effect does nothing . 
  according to the english-language wikipedia , they 're radical centrists . 
  there is no * left left * in the parliament . 
  ( i was waiting the entire campaign to make this pun . ), 
   i am just afraid they could get constitutional majority and could amend constitution . 
  nah , they 'd need  40 % votes for that . 
  does n't matter , she is representing them . 
  a party is not defined by its leader , especially if said leader is a figurehead . 
  sld makes up the majority of zl . 
  reproduction is limited by women . 
  those men wo n't give birth to any children . 
  football , rugby , handball , water polo , basketball , volleyball , tennis and hockey are basically all the same sport : `` put this small object into opponent 's designated area , while defending your designated area . '', 
  the difference is mostly about what you are allowed to do with the object , what happens if you cause the object to leave the field , are there any exceptions to the contact with the designated area , and how many people there are in a team . 
   but the problem is , in islam you do n't have any centralised organisation like , for example , in catholic church . 
  christianity is mostly organised in hierarchies : there 's catholic hierarchy , there are multiple orthodox hierarchies , which cooperate , there are state-sponsored protestant hierarchies ( anglican , swedish lutheran , and so on ) , there are some other protestant hierarchies . 
  christianity is like that from the very start , with jesus having disciples , with all those flock and shepherd metaphors . 
  but then you have smaller , independent churches in america , that do not feel obliged to belong in a hierarchy and split and merge wherever a single pastor feels like it . 
  guess which ones are more radical . 
  if the votes were gathered electronically , then yes . 
  but as i said elsewhere , this is still a research problem , you ca n't just post online `` citizen # 3636456 voted x '' , because then that citizen could use his receipt # 3636456 to collect the promised bribe .
