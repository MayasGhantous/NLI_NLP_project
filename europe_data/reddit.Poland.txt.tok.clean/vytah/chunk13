  and before anyone mentions it , no , the estonian system does n't let you check if your vote counted , it only lets you check if the vote was sent correctly . 
  this is only an equivalent to seeing your x on the ballot paper and seeing that paper end up in the ballot box . 
  if the votes are gathered in a paper form , then all you have to do is to look at the physical process of collecting the votes and counting them . 
  harder ( especially if `` collecting '' part involves mail ) , but mostly doable if there are observers from opposing sides of the political spectrum at each voting location . 
  inb4 someone cracks it . 
  all the ballots have to be published publicly , preferably in such a way , that it 's impossible to guess who voted what , except for your own vote , so you can check that your ballot has been registered correctly . 
  then you can just sum all the numbers to see if the results match . 
  of course this is not a panacea for all ills -- fraud is still possible , just not the `` ignore all the votes '' kind . 
   but how you can be sure that what you just verified that way is actually counted in the final results ? 
  there are ways to do so that involve posting all ballots in such a way that they 're both tallyable and verifiable by the voters . 
  it 's called end-to-end verifiability , it 's still a research problem , and all known solutions have problems . 
  estonian system is not end-to-end verifiable and in the end it 's the matter of trust that the servers actually count the votes as intended . 
  any argument instead of name-calling ? 
  canada revokes your voting rights after you have lived for 5 years abroad .

  that 's why the eastern slavs are n't muslim :  the primary chronicle reports that in the year 987 , after consultation with his boyars , vladimir the great sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths . 
  the result is described by the chronicler nestor . 
  of the muslim bulgarians of the volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them , only sorrow and a great stench . 
  he also reported that islam was undesirable due to its taboo against alcoholic beverages and pork .

  i 'm not sure how i 'll vote , it depends on the final stretch of the campaign , but pis looks like a solid , but boring choice . 
  i 'm planning to vote strategically anyway . 
  i 'd also like to speculate about what the coalition might look like : * pis might win a majority ; * pis + kukiz , the most likely result , but will be unstable like pis + samoobrona + lpr in 2005 -- 2007 ; * if korwin manages to get in , pis + korwin or pis + korwin+k ukiz ; * it 's also possible that we get pis + petru or pis + psl , but that will require a lot of negotiations and po will be pissed ; pis + petru + psl is really unlikely , petru refuses to work with psl ; * if pis , kukiz and korwin all fuck up , we might get po+zl+p etru or po+zl+psl ; * or we can have a minority pis government . 
  total chaos ensues , early elections next autumn . 
  edit : there 's also another possibility : pis fails to get majority and fails to form a majority coalition , but they manage to steal enough representatives from the other parties , mostly po and psl , to get to that magic 231 .

  german plugs land in such a way that the pins point horizontally , so when you step on a plug , you usually step on its side , which is annoying ... but not as painful as stepping on a british plug pins up .
