  do n't forget the senate : 2 senators per state , regardless of size . 
  also , states have varying number of representatives in the lower house , but states with fewer people per representative are often less populous ones , like wyoming or rhode island .

  the op asked `` in your country '' . 
  / w / is practically the only pronunciation , except for some older people in some parts of the country and polish minorities outside of poland . 
  when i was doing my master 's degree , we had a single student who did n't pronounce \u0142 as / w / . 
  she was from vilnius . 
  almost not at all . 
  practically everybody under the age of 60 speaks the same , except for some minor vocabulary differences . 
   i have often seen how native english speakers do n't understand what appear to be pretty simple text , because the wording is slightly off or weird . 
  this reminds me of an official eu document about common english mistakes made by eu officials in eu documents : http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf example :  ** control ( to control , a control ) **  ** explanation **  to control does not usually mean ` to audit ' ` check ' or ` verify ' ^ ( this meaning is not mentioned at all in the oxford online dictionary and is described by merriam webster as `` archaic '' [ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/control] . ), 
  and ` a control ' is not normally ` a check ' or ` an inspection ' . 
  its most common meaning is ` to exercise authoritative or dominating influence over ; direct ' . 
  thus , if we say that ` the commission controlled project x in the member states ' , we do not mean that the commission audited it , but that the commission ran it . 
  in combination with a few other terms contained in this list , this misuse can end up sounding quite sinister ( e.g. 
  ` the commission 's contract agents were on a mission in the united kingdom to control execution under axis ii ' ) . 
  used as a noun , we do not ` carry out ' or ` perform ' controls . 
  controls are more likely to be systems that are in place ( passport controls , for example ) . 
  hence , we can say that the court checked to see if the key controls were working , but not that it carried out controls . 
  when talking about systems , the best term will often be ` safeguard ' . 
  for example , ` a number of safeguards are built into the system to ensure that funds are spent correctly ' . 
   ** examples **  ` administrative checks must be under taken on all applications for support and payment claims , and cover all elements that are possible and appropriate to * control * by administrative means . ' ` apart from the annual review of the reference amount , customs authorities are not obliged to carry out * controls * after authorisation . '  ** alternatives **  audit , check , verify/verification , inspect/inspection , safeguard, 
  maybe . 
  i fully expect such clauses to be more common if this regulation passes . 
   employers will deal with that and be paying those 13 pln/h gross or will try to bypass the law once again . 
  `` the contract will say 13 z\u0142 / h , but it will also introduce a penalty of 3 z\u0142 / h for some made-up reason . '',

  in one episode of futurama , professor farnsworth shows his employees an universal translator that sadly translates only into some unknown extinct language . 
  when fry said `` hello '' , the machine answered `` bonjour '' .

  `` working their ass off '' is meaningless from economic standpoint . 
  and economy is n't about being fair . 
  we tried fair economy . 
  it 's called communism and it sucked . 
  productivity is a useful measure , because it 's directly related to wages . 
  if average productivity increases because of investments in certain sectors of economy , or because of changing situation on global markets , it influences incomes of people who work in other sectors as well . 
  a dutch worker does n't earn more that greek worker because he 's working harder , but either because his employer has more capital that increases the output of the company , or because the effects of his work are sold to other well-earning dutch people . 
  digging a pointless hole is the opposite of productive , regardless of how fast you 're digging it . 
  if you want to look at it at this angle , they get free rent , free food and other free stuff .

  it 's partially because spain , thanks to napoleon , is in the wrong time zone . 
  most of spain is west of london , yet it has the same time as warsaw . 
  solar noon in valencia ( spain 's east coast ) is at 13:00 in winter and 14:00 in summer , and it gets worse further west , up to 14:19 in santiago de compostela . 
  apart from oxides , coal power plants do not emit much else , especially compared to fuel-powered cars . 
  so switching to electric cars would not only improve air in the cities , but also not make it worse elsewhere . 
  ignoring carbon oxide of course .

  `` fun '' fact : ceaucescu 's ban was more liberal than the * current * polish legislation , just more strictly enforced .

  simply a streamlined way of filling out a form for wire transfers with instant confirmation for the merchant . 
  this kind of thing requires some work to integrate systems between the merchant and the bank , so you have to have an account in a supported bank to use it . 
  at least it 's not something stupid like german [ sofort ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/sofort%c3%bcberweisung.svg ) or swedish [ trustly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trustly ) , which are literally about letting a 3rd party access your bank account directly . 
  prices of certain things scale pretty well with average income .

  the right to cross an outer schengen border does not imply the right to cross an inner schengen border , it does n't even imply the right of free movement within the entirety of the first schengen country . 
  for example , russians living in the kaliningrad oblast and ukrainians from some parts of western ukraine can apply for a local border traffic pass , which allows them to cross the polish border without a visa and travel within the designated part of poland , but it does n't allow them to go to for example warsaw , let alone to another schengen country . 
  were they caught outside the designated zone , they 'd get deported .

   lech was killed antoni plz, 
  since the kaczy\u0144ski twins come from a single fertilized egg , does it mean each of them is only half a human ? 
  since identical twins come from a single zygote , does that mean they have only one soul in total ? 
  what about chimeras , do they have two souls ? 
  17th century is not exactly middle ages . 
  irish legislation is actually stricter than the polish one : polish law currently allows for abortion in case of rape and fetal defects , while the irish one does n't . 
  but if this new legislation passes without changes , it 's poland who will have the strictest law in europe , if not in the world . 
   one way to go would be to introduce one common eu migrant/refugee welfare support on the level of the poorest members of the eu . 
  juncker approves , that means those pesky refugees would stay away from luxembourg . 
  that works the other way around : it made many prussian citizens into polish citizens .
