  so , the solution for the muslim immigration issue is to simply point out that none of those immigrants are true muslims and therefore there 's zero muslim immigration !,

  i remember their anticlerical ads during the 2011 electoral campaign , like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jujiatuucxe ) . 
  that 's what killed palikot 's party in poland . 
  his original program was anticlerical and pro-weed , with bits of economic liberalism here and there , but then he quickly migrated towards full-blown left and lost all ( and i do mean all ) his political capital almost instantly . 
  most of his voters and those who 'd vote for him if they were of age switched mostly to various minor right-wing parties or to petru 's party . 
  what you actually end up doing is : use wikipeda , find a relevant statement , look up it 's source , claim to have used that source instead of wikipedia .

  we went to russia in 1610 . 
  they are still so salty about that , that [ they recently made a public holiday about us going home ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_ ( russia \\ ) ) .

   yeah , the romanian paradox . 
  lem me guess : it 's about a certain ethnic minority . 
   way too little on the world wars because sweden sat them out . 
  and since every country 's history is different , the curricula will be different . 
  i do not expect swedes to learn about the lublin union and in turn swedes should n't expect me to know about the kalmar union . 
  testing middleschoolers about these events is incomparable . 
  the same goes for literature ( i ca n't name any swedish writer except for astrid lindgren ) or foreign languages . 
  maths and science are supranational . 
   foreign music was dubbed this happens all the time , it 's called covers .

  `` my party has only 108 out of 110 seats !, 
  look how democratic i am ! '', 
  the affected constituencies were the smallest ones , often made of several small villages . 
  before the reform , they were larger , the ordination was * n * - fptp ( top * n * candidates get in ) and every voter had * n * votes , for different values of * n * , usually 2 -- 3 . 
  this led to some villages having multiple representatives in the commune council while many villages had none . 
  switching to 1-seat constituencies allowed for more uniform geographic distribution of council members . 
  i agree 1-fptp is bad , but it 's better than 2-fptp or 3-fptp . 
  an identical change happened earlier with senate elections : from 2/3-fptp to normal fptp . 
  it increased the chance of candidates from opposing parties in the same voivodeship to get in , while before that usually only a single party would get the seats -- at least that 's the theory , in practice the results were similar . 
   french do n't know a thing or two about bread making . 
  nah , they even had to get the recipes for baguettes and croissants for [ austrians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august_zang ) . 
  the problem with so-called `` greyish '' is because the flag has been defined in terms of how it should look in real life , not in a symbolic representation on a screen , and a white screen is going to be much brighter than a white cloth . 
  after poland has introduced fptp in the lowest-level municipal elections , many constituencies turned out to be so small , that ties of few dozen votes for two candidates were pretty frequent and about 200 councilmembers had to be chosen by a coin toss . 
  we have many eurosceptic parties . 
  pis is n't one of them .

   she answered in french , but at the moment the guy detected the spanish accent he switched to a very broken spanish . 
  as it seems , he could n't tolerate to hear moliere 's language mistreated that way and thought that torturing cervantes ' one was better . 
  i wonder which is more efficient if two people speak each others language , but poorly : each speaks their native language , or each speaks the other 's native language .

  just for the sake of those wondering : the copyright of mein kampf ( and therefore the final say in whether it can published and distributed or not ) belonged to the state of bavaria up until the end of 2015 . 
  the bavarian government simply exercised its copyright by not allowing anyone to publish the book . 
  the first legal publication of mein kampf since the ww2 happened in january 2016 . 
  it was a heavily annotated version . 
  it was published so quickly in order to be first to the market before the neonazis , who would publish it either unannotated or annotated in a different way . 
   well , i got an argument to trump that . 
  isis will stop using encryption because france has banned it . 
  yeah , right . 
  [ let me expand on that idea . 
  duolingo 's creator said that the main reason duolingo does n't use the mexican flag despite teaching a generic variant of latin american spanish , but close to the mexican dialect , and despite mexico being the largest spanish-speaking country , is that the mexican flag is too similar to the italian one . 
  that was n't murder , that was a court-ordained execution . 
  hebrew was revived because it was the only language shared by all jewish communities that started gathering in the palestine . 
  it was a language that was used if not daily , then at least weekly by most jews and it was strongly and inseparably tied to the jewish identity . 
  you ca n't compare hebrew to irish . 
  it happens in lots of languages . 
  polish does it from time to time , chinese does it almost always , portuguese does it , etc. 
  it 's about regional stereotypes , and your examples apply to the whole luxembourg .
