  some polish catholic conservatives regularly criticise the pope for being too tolerant . 
  even some bishops do that , although in an indirect way . 
   there will be plenty of new jobs what will they be ? 
   created in order to manage , maintain and develop this ai/robotics that does n't work that way . 
  from the economic standpoint , those people directly replace people replaced by robots , they 're just further away on the work supply chain . 
  but in order for automation to happen , it has to be cheaper than employing low-skilled workers . 
  and since those people who manage/maintain/create robots usually earn more than low skilled workers , there will be significantly fewer of them employed . 
  no one is going to replace 1000 factory grunts with 1000 engineers scattered around several different companies and buying shiny new robots on top of that . 
  see : http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966  one factory has `` reduced employee strength from 110,000 to 50,000 thanks to the introduction of robots '' , a government official told the south china morning post . 
  http://www.techrepublic.com/article/chinese-factory-replaces-90-of-humans-with-robots-production-soars/  previously , there were 650 employees at the factory . 
  with the new robots , there 's now only 60 . 
  luo weiqiang , general manager of the company , told the people 's daily that the number of employees could drop to 20 in the future . 
   the factory has since seen fewer defects and a higher rate of production . 
  the new jobs after the agricultural and industrial revolutions were about improved production and distribution of goods , and about goods that solved daily human needs . 
  but now , chores are really insignificant compared to 150 years ago , and they 're getting progressively easier and easier to do . 
  laundry , dish-washing , hoovering -- all automated decades ago . 
  you no longer have to think to yourself `` if only stuff was cheaper , i could afford to hire a woman to do [ this ] ( http://photos-ak.sparkpeople.com/nw/2/1/l2131215360.jpg ) , it would create some new jobs '' . 
  guess what , her job is gone and not coming back . 
  nowadays in the first world , most consumer spending -- which is what is going to pay for all those jobs -- fuels production of goods , transport of goods , and retail sale of goods , all three of which are predicted to get automated in the future , and housing construction , which with current demographic trends is not going to boom any time soon . 
  the only mass-employment sector i can think of that will significantly grow is child - and elderly care . 
  lukashenka would put them to work , and they definitely would not like it . 
  when i was studying , po had just introduced a programme to pay 1000 z\u0142 / mo for students of certain majors ( mostly stem ) . 
  there were quite a lot of people in my class who started the msc programme and dropped off in the middle of semester , while still formally being students and cashing 10 \u00d7 1000 z\u0142 throughout the entire year . 
  it was obvious that bsc was the limit of their skills , but free cash kept them in . 
  i know that some people enrol just to have student discounts , but that was the whole new level of abuse . 
   no that 's the one where you end up looting ~ ~ constantinople ~ ~ erdoganople . 
  ftfy, 
  we should switch to `` i 'm racist '' . 
  for example : `` i 'm racist , but obama is a pretty decent president . '', 
  well , he also thanked god .

  ah , yes , they got a visit from the serial suicider .

  undoing the vowel shift would make english sound like dutch . 
   but having a recruitment solely based on merit and ability for both sexes will do the exact opposite . 
  not necessarily . 
  actual experiences showed that men start behaving irrationally in presence in women and they 're likely to endanger the entire unit to protect a single woman : http://hotair.com/archives/2013/01/27/some-advice-on-women-in-combat-from-a-female-veteran/comment-page-1/ therefore , i think there should be no mixed-gender units and genders should be separated in the military as much as possible . 
  it 's typical hypocrisy : we 're nice to everybody , we proudly assert our niceness to everybody , as long as that everybody is living far away .

  how can opening a refugee shelter gentrify a street ? 
  i 'd say it 's the opposite . 
  the holocaust took life of 11 million people , including 6 million jews , 3 million poles and 2 million others . 
  guess whom people in the west solely care about .

  people do n't hate strangers , people hate their neighbours . 
  bloody immigrants !, 
   definitely not the one of immigrants depends on whether you can describe people coming from an invading/occupying state and settling in your state as `` immigrants '' . 
  but i agree , demographic changes after ww2 caused by the soviet union are pretty unique . 
   pensionists you mean unemployed immigrants leeching on catalan healthcare system . 
  in case of estonia and latvia , those numbers show soviet settlers after the invasion of the baltic states , and their descendants , not any recent immigrants . 
  estonia and latvia did n't grant citizenships to all their inhabitants with soviet citizenships , unlike all other ex-soviet states . 
  so they are n't any citizens , let alone foreign . 
  the map is lying . 
  soviets and americans held a race , with the best runner from each country participating . 
  the pravda summarised the event as follows : `` comrade medlenneev took the honourable second place . 
  the american contestant came in one before last . '', 
  countdown till everyone calls it * londres * ... 
  more like people from the former british empire do n't want barbarians in their empire 's capital island . 
  merkel giving out free stuff to immigrants again . 
  at least in poland , german is spoke n mostly by people born in 60s , 70s and early 80s , who grew up when german language education was more common and people often travelled to germany to trade , watched german tv and bought wares with german labelling . 
  nowadays , less and less people speak it , and while it 's still taught in most high schools , it 's losing ground to english , and also french and spanish . 
  those are n't `` first days '' . 
   in first days in that war so they died invading poland or finland ? 
  this is a commonly accepted theory : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages, 
  he 's got some experience in destroying though . 
  when he proposed the lustration act in 1992 , it was immediately voted in and caused dissolution of olszewski 's goverment in less than a week . 
  ( note his party had just 3 seats out of 460 . ), 
  all parties he was in suffered from internal squabbles , causing him to leave , with most voters following him to his next party . 
  his current party is called korwin , he probably ran out of marketable names . 
  people speculate that his next party will be called mikke . 
  his current goal is to destroy the ue from the inside , but i do n't think he 's doing a particularly great job . 
  so far , he managed to give several controversial speeches , slap micha\u0142 boni in the face , and get called `` too crazy '' by marine le pen and geert wilders . 
  when speaking polish or `` moreover , i think that the european union should be destroyed . '', 
  when speaking english . 
  imagine irish english becoming the standard . 
  technically speaking , you can use any language in the parliament . 
  the question is will anyone understand you . 
  ecj is in luxembourg . 
  luxembourgers speak luxembourgish , which is closely related to german , and therefore the luxemburgish law is written in french . 
  i think one cato quoter is enough . 
  is n't up to all other countries to provide a translator from maltese to their own language ? 
  sure , as the original rules say . 
  all wars in greece . 
  it 's not . 
  joining schengen would require them to introduce checkpoints on northern ireland-republic of ireland border , since the uk is n't in schengen , and they prefer to keep their free movement agreement with the uk . 
  i propose that we return to the original idea of olympics : 1 . only the original events 2 . only men 3 . only greek citizens 4 . everyone competes naked, 
  actually both ways .

  the league fans sure do , although it 's improving slowly . 
  the national team has a lot of more casual fans , because the national team in the 90s was very weak , so the hardcore football fans did n't care about it much . 
  til it 's hungary 's responsibility to build a fence on croatian-bosnian border . 
  good luck in doing so in russia and england . 
   racial profiling creates more criminals does n't lack of racial profiling cause the general air of acceptance for criminality in the group in question : `` become a thug , cops are too scared to do anything anyway '' ? 
  you have n't hung around in monarchist circles , have you ? 
  the general idea being : the king has a vested interest in keeping the country in the best possible condition , because he 's ruling it until his death and then passing it to a person he really cares about : his child . 
  the same argument goes for dictators , although the authoritarians have much less online presence than monarchists . 
  how are they discriminated against ?
