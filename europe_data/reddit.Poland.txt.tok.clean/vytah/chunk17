  how are they discriminated against ? 
  we 're not talking about / r/europe . 
   spain has many people who worked previously in construction industry you mean people who built all those ghost towns ? 
  does that rapid unemployment growth in late 00s coincide with the real estate bubble burst ? 
  turks , pomaks and roma do n't wear niqabs . 
  fuck , look at the name alone : ni ** q ** ab . 
  [ voiceless uvular stop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_uvular_stop ) . 
  no european language has uvular stops , neither has turkish . 
   in theory it could be more efficient . 
  in theory , having one entity to manage the entire economy would be more efficient than having multiple entities compete with each other and waste money on advertising and other capitalist activities . 
  in practice , well ... you know how it ends . 
   tell me one way in which poland will be worst off if it united with germany ? 
  we tried that in the 19th century . 
  did n't work that well . 
  [ when the swiss heard from you that they 're not relevant ] ( http://replygif.net/i/718.gif ), 
  there are three more powerful countries in between : usb , usc and usd . 
  that generosity measure has nothing to do with that :  generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of gwp responses to the question `` have you donated money to a charity in the past month ? '' on gdp per capita .

   nowhere did you differentiate between state collectivism and social collectivism he literally wrote `` collectivist society '' , not `` collectivist state '' though . 
  if you have one party that says `` immigrants commit a lot of crime , so we 'll stop immigration ! '', 
  and another that says `` immigrants commit a lot of crime , so we 'll increase immigration !, 
  '' , guess which one will convince people more . 
  [ first reich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_roman_empire ) [ second reich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_empire ), 
  i though that `` lead exposure '' was an euphemism for a more solid forms of lead . 
  the problem with that research is that the situation keeps changing . 
  you 'd need several planets for reproducibility of those studies . 
  as for the car industry , there 's a limit to the number of cars people need , and when it 's hit , all improvements in productivity wo n't go into increasing the production , but into reduction of expenses . 
  which involves firing people . 
  also , the class that is most likely to lose jobs due to automation , is low-qualified people . 
  so far , they transitioned from agriculture through manufacturing to low-level services , like retail and basic customer service . 
  i do n't see a new outlet for those masses of people . 
  i have no personal stake in automation , both me and most of my immediate family work in areas that are n't likely to be automated anyway soon , but i still wonder how it will shape the world around us . 
  automation will cause a loss of jobs , but the effect wo n't be as huge as futurists predict . 
  i think no more than 5 percentage points over 20 years , first-world countries only , ignoring immigration effects . 
  it will happen as soon as it 's profitable -- if you have to pay 10 western/japanese selfie-obsessed unqualified young ` uns $ 10/hr each , at some point it becomes cheaper to replace five of them with an automated solution . 
  the remaining five will have now a less-routine job and they will supply a larger number of customers . 
  and i do n't see any job opportunities for those five that are going to be let go . 
  it 's not as easy as `` change your job , take a loan '' . 
  something i found quickly : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/#exports, 
   any nation should be able to defend itself . 
  more precisely , any nation should be able to * successfully * defend itself from an attack by * a state of similar size and economic status * . 
  i do n't expect mongolia to be able to defend itself from a full-scale russo-chinese invasion , but i do expect that it wo n't just let a single division to just walk in without any casualties . 
  i also expect that in case of north-sourth korean conflict , if no third party intervenes , that the invasion will fail , whoever invades whom . 
  so the question is : which medium-sized country on earth could successfully invade or deal heavy damage to the netherlands now ?

  this reminds me of this old joke story : http://www.teksty.jeja.pl/567,pamietnik-terrorysty.html , i guess it 's probably from around 2005 . 
   terrorist 's diary  day 1  we have been preparing an attack on poland for a month . 
  i 'm there now with many others , who are ready to sacrifice their lives for faith . 
  sure , some of our baggage was lost at the airport , but lots was left . 
  some bald guys with striped pants beat us up . 
  we rented a room at a hotel . 
   day 2  al-muzharedin , olazeher and i planted a bomb in a car and came back to watch news . 
  since they said nothing about the car bomb , we went to check what happened . 
  the car was missing a radio , wipers , seat covers , mirrors , steering wheel lock and the bomb . 
  the bald guys with striped pants beat us up . 
   day 3  today we 've been resting after the failure . 
  the bald guys beat us up . 
  we 're supposed to receive additional equipment from our country . 
  in the evening , we sent 5 of our strongest heads to a bar , they were supposed to drink poles to death . 
  they all died in action , we prayed for them . 
  the bald guys beat us up . 
   day 4  since our hotel tv got stolen , we 're listening to the radio . 
  the polish chistrian spiritual leader is even worse than ours !, 
  he hates jews and freemasons , who want to destroy the polish nation . 
  was someone quicker than us ? 
  i hope that rev. 
  rydzyk wo n't learn about us while we 're still here . 
  the bald guys did n't beat us up , since we 've been staying inside . 
   day 5  we 're preparing to demolish the palace of culture . 
  the equipment was supposed to arrive today , but everything got lost in mail , only a package with weapon manuals arrived , the weapons themselves did not . 
  we watched `` m jak mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 '' , alezhebar started crying . 
   day 6  we sent an envelope with anthrax to the polish president . 
  it did n't reach him . 
  the bald guys beat us up . 
   day 7  it 's the climax , we 're destroying the palace of culture . 
  since we have no explosives , we bought good german shovels at the supermarket and started digging under the foundations . 
  the shovels broke . 
  the bald guys beat us up . 
   day 8  today al-quaherezejuan went for a suicide mission !, 
  he 'll run into a supermarket with a bomb and detonate it . 
  he came back after six hours . 
  first his bomb got stolen , and then the bald guys beat him up . 
   day 9  the poles have elected a new president . 
  we 're going home . 
  it 's going great with poland even without our attacks . 
  can any frenchmen tell about what were the effects of the similar french law about radio music ? 
  because i heard the effects were rather bad .

  last time i checked on numbeo , [ budapest is more expensive than bucharest ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=romania&amp;country2=hungary&amp;city1=bucharest&amp;city2=budapest ) . 
  granted , differences are n't large , and some things might be cheaper in hungary than in romania , but some things are very cheap in london and i would n't consider it a cheap city just because of that . 
  i know that poland is probably the cheapest country in the entire eu , and perhaps even europe , but op wanted us to pick a * different * country . 
  and romania seems like a nice choice . 
  romania . 
  everything 's cheap . 
  nice weather . 
  nice views . 
  are bicameral scripts really worth it ? 
  i mean , half people of earth use speak a language with a writing system that uses just a single case and it works fine .
