  capitalization rules for chinese , hindi , arabic , japanese , bengali , hebrew , georgian , thai , korean , persian , urdu ? 
  simple : none !, 
  ca n't beat that . 
  protip : it does n't if german is your source language instead of target language . 
  depends on the language . 
  it 's better for eastern slavic , it 's equally good for southern slavic , it 's worse for czech , and for polish no writing system works well . 
  i said `` courses ** for norwegian speakers ** '' , not `` norwegian courses '' . 
  there are n't any courses for norwegian speakers on duolingo , so most norwegian users use courses in english to learn a third language . 
  there are n't any courses for croatian/bulgarian/albanian / serbian/slovenian speakers on duolingo , so users in those countries most likely use duolingo in english to learn a third language . 
  the same for nordics : there are no courses for swedish/norwegian/danish / finnish speakers , so they learn other languages on duolingo as well .

  depends of your definition of europe . 
  if you go through the peaks of caucasus , then chechnya is in the north of that line , therefore on the european side .

  that was my point . 
  map on the banknote does n't depend on current member roster of the eu . 
  they kept norway on the note after norway left the eu , so why now ? 
  most commonly used or most numerous ? 
  if you have a single $ 5 note that changes hands 10 times a month , and 10 $ 50 notes that sit in a single safe all that time , $ 50 is much less commonly used , despite being 10 times more numerous . 
  similarly , in poland , 200 z\u0142 is the second most numerous note , and 20 z\u0142 is the least numerous , but stand next to the registers in any grocery store and see what people hand to cashiers more often . 
  so : `` for 100 job positions , how many are still available for jobseekers ? '', 
  neither could the pope 's . 
  because it 's in the middle . 
  an apple a day keeps the doctor away . 
  therefore , most apples means fewest doctors . 
  in most opinion polls about the sentiment of poles towards other nationalities , romanians tend to score near the bottom , just above arabs . 
  you can guess who 's to blame for this bad press . 
  many people treat `` cygan '' and `` rumun '' as 100 % synonyms . 
  oh the enlightened westerner , tell us filthy easterners how the life in eastern europe is like !,

  from page 83 , using guesswork , as i do n't speak macedonian :  macedonians had their own language . 
  it differed from languages of their neighbours : hellenes , illyrians , and thracians . 
  to this day no books or inscriptions in the macedonian language have been found .

  lindybeige made a video about that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdnyu1tquxg long story short , before gunpowder battles were mostly about series of short close combat encounters . 
  gunpowder and then artillery barrage changed it into an unending stream of faceless noise and death .

  while the word * niderlandy * exists , it 's rarely used and some people use it only for the kingdom as a whole , not its main constituent country . 
  there 's no [ demonym ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demonym ) from * niderlandy * . 
  the language can be called either * holenderski * or * niderlandzki * , the former will be more easily understood by an average pole , while the latter is used in more formal or academic contexts .

  kaczy\u0144ski has expected it , he was just posturing to check if he has someone in europe to support his other silly ideas . 
  it turned out even orb\u00e1n does n't like him that much . 
  it 's been always personal , or at least since po and pis are major players in the politics . 
  why did the 2005-2007 pis government fail ? 
  because they failed to make the expected coalition with po and made a deal instead with some loony ultracatholic conservatives and peasant populists . 
  which side is more responsible for this failure , i do n't know . 
  sufficient to say , those two parties have hated each other ever since .

   write tens of thousands of pages of new laws ; do n't they already have most of those ? 
  they 'll just have to fix references to uk-eu partnership and fill up gaps left by various uk opt-outs . 
  do you have a flag ? 
  no flag , no country . 
  in ireland , it 's already too late for quotas , and also ireland has two official languages , unlike ukraine . 
  funnily enough , ireland 's main irish-language tv channel , tg4 , subtitles most of the non-live irish content in english , but usually does n't subtitle english content in irish . 
  do they purchase real estate , or do they rent ? 
  properties and assets owned by companies ( e.g. 
  banks ) were not counted . 
  ( the number for ukraine is almost $ 1.5 k , $ 1k is just a rounding . ), 
  you should count about 2 adults per apartment on average , plus you should assume not every apartment is owned by its tenants , let 's say half . 
  but even with all those assumptions , $ 6k per apartment is laughably low . 
  poorly , but not that poorly . 
  in fact , estonia , latvia and czechoslovakia were near the level of spain and italy before the ww2 . 
  it 's the other way around : two speed eu is required for the east to catch up to the west . 
  the catch is that it 's the west that must be slower and the east that must be faster . 
  at one speed , the gap will stay unchanged . 
  it 's not like ireland chased west . 
  the growth in ireland was just a bit faster , so you can say they ran at the same speed . 
  it 's the east that ran slower for four decades . 
  sorry , but i need to dispute your claim . 
  i think that the title of the roman emperor should descent to the highest ranking royal title . 
  tsar nicholas ii had multiple titles ; after the emperor of all the russias , but before the grand duke of finland and lithuania , he had four king titles . 
  three of them ended up within soviet russia , but one of them managed to get commie-free . 
  then , on the 14th of november 1918 , the regency council , whose task was to temporarily replace the king , bestowed all the power into the hands of one man . 
  all hail roman emperor j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski !, 
  but it does n't break the rule of tincture . 
  there 's not enough coordination when it comes to european military . 
  against a single unified enemy it would n't do as well as the raw numbers would suggest . 
  and there is a single power that likes to mess with multiple nato and eu members ( like canada , norway , sweden , finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , montenegro and turkey ) , i 'll let you guess what power i 'm referring to .

  let 's not look at the us for sensible naming schemes .
