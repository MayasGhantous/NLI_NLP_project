  an intervocalic allophone existing only in fast speech for some speakers . 
  standard pronunciation is always / b / . 
  actually , * ppols\u016dkka * is a loanword from polish , russian word for poland is * polsha * , which would probably be koreanised as * ppolsya * . 
  this distinction ( / p / vs / p\u02b0 / ) does exist in some indo-european languages . 
  for example , icelandic has those sounds , and it even uses the same letters ( < b  for / p / and < p  for / p\u02b0 / ) . 
  armenian has both those sound , plus also / b / . 
  hindi has both those sounds , together with / b / and / b\u02b0 / . 
  even most accents of english have them , although the distinction is not phonemic as those sounds appear in different environments . 
  and finally , ancient greek used to have them , that 's why greek loanwords in latin have ph instead of f -- \u03a6 used to be pronounced / p\u02b0 / and only later became / f / . 
  note that the korean examples represent the south korean terminology . 
  names of some countries are different in north korea . 
  chinese has l at the beginning of syllables and r at the end ( if you see an r at the beginning , it 's actually read like \u017e ) . 
  korean < eo  is pronounced similar to schwa / \u0259 / , which would correspond to ( probably ) dutch * ned **** e **** rland * . 
  ruidan makes sense when you notice that \u745e\u5178 is seoi-din in cantonese and sui-ti\u00e9n in hakka . 
  japanese / b / is a quite normal , not soft . 
  it 's just japanese has literally no other voiced bilabial or labiodental consonant . 
  i 've seen dozens of comments from people trying to learn polish or russian asking what 's the difference between sz / \u0448 and \u015b / \u0449 , because they could n't hear it . 
  there were studies conducted on japanese subjects . 
  all of them had some prior exposure to english . 
  they were given a random sequence of recordings of words `` lock '' and `` rock '' and they had to guess which sound is which . 
  the results were very poor : https://web.stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/mccfiezmccandliss02.pdf, 
  some polish-language russian propaganda websites do not shy from bad grammar and showing authors ' names that are clearly russian . 
  it seems that russians can learn foreign languages too . 
  guessing it 's bosnia , many people were probably using cheap chinese plastic helmets that break into bunch of sharp pieces on impact . 
  such helmets provide almost no protection and might even be dangerous . 
  poland currently has no left-wing party in the parliament . 
  do n't look at russia . 
  they like the communist era . 
  stalin 's approval rate are in high fifties and growing . 
  i 've heard most dialects of serbo-croatian languages have merged dative and locative . 
  can a native speaker confirm ? 
  i 'd say english no longer has genitive , * 's * stopped being a case marker and turned into a postposition . 
  you can see it when you apply it to a noun phrase : you say * queen elizabeth ii 's corgis * , not \\* * queen 's elizabeth 's ii corgis * . 
  as for * mine * , * whose * etc. , they can be considered a special category of pronouns , especially since they are not used like the `` genitive '' of nouns : you say * her corgis * and not \\* * hers corgis * . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  and they use comic sans . 
  i heard he was expelled for putting pineapple on pizza . 
  why a tiger and not a kangaroo ? 
  it does in welsh . 
  so does w. 
   you know all words , but you do n't know how to connect them . 
  this literally is what `` lexical distance '' is . 
  i mean , the thing that this chart shows . 
  it 's not like it 's in its title or anything . 
  every `` link '' means that a linguist bothered to measure the distance . 
  some examples of linguists are given in the bottom right corner . 
  almost all issues raised were wrong : -- people care about were the languages are positioned on the graph , but the positioning is purely arbitrary and chosen for aesthetic reasons -- people care about which languages are connected , but connections only show which pairs of languages were measured , not which are supposed to be most similar -- people care about intellegibility of languages , but the metric used is just lexical similarity and has nothing to do with grammar , syntax , pronunciation , rhythm or other important features that are more important for intelligibility, 
  it does n't show that . 
  the line used to connect is of the same thickness in both cases . 
   the dutch have a direct link to greek ? 
  the `` link '' means that the similarity was measured , nothing else . 
  because it was not measured . 
  every `` connection '' means only that the researchers bothered to measure distance between that pair . 
   ron [ because rom is romani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_iso_639-2_codes ), 
  what doea similarity between two languages have to do with the fact that t. elms and k. tishchenko did n't bother to measure it ? 
  they have n't measured distance between occitan and catalan , and due to the fact that the graph is already cramped as it is , they drew them further away for legibility . 
  i do n't see anything controversial about it . 
  because polish and russian are only slightly more related than polish and lithuanian . 
  it does n't show any distance between catalan and occitan . 
  how do you know they are further apart , if there is no distance given ? 
   polish as puchar which used to be spelt `` puhar '' , but in 1936 there was a spelling reform that aimed to regularise spelling of less common words . 
  since - h - and - ch - are pronounced the same in almost all dialects of polish , there are very few words with - h - in the middle and they usually have it there because of a related word containing - g - or - \u017c - , there was no reason to keep - h - in `` puhar '' and it got changed to `` puchar '' . 
  russian has lots of old church slavonic loanwords , and ocs is a south slavic language . 
  russian has a lot of south slavic loanwords through old church slavonic , ukrainian and belorussian have a lot of western slavic loanwords through polish . 
  looks like dark red was eaten by green .

  it does n't appear to be more than 300m across the moat , you could use a trebuchet .

  the history of czech flag is pretty interesting if not silly : after the ww1 , the idea was to use white and red for the czech flag , since it had been used as the bohemian flag within the austro-hungarian empire . 
  but poles were faster , so czechs decided to add a blue triangle to represent slovakians in the new czechoslovakian state . 
  after the fall of communism , the idea was to split czechoslovakia and the white and red flag was used again to represent the czech part of the federation . 
  czechs and slovaks made an agreement that after the split neither country would use symbols of communist czechoslovakia , but czechs noticed that they were again trying to use the same flag as poland , so they quickly broke the agreement and used the czechoslovakian flag for themselves .

  i 'm learning both spanish and german and while in spanish i know the rules and most of exceptions just fine , in german it 's less rules and more of guesswork , intuition and raw memorisation -- and i keep getting things wrong . 
  for comparison , slavic languages tend to slightly less regular than spanish , but much more regular than german . 
  what if * die * means plural here , not female ? 
   also take into consideration that in the romance languages almost all month names come from the romans . 
  but the numbering is wrong after they added two months at the beginning . 
  though it did n't stop some from using `` 7 ^ ( bre ) / vii ^ ( bre ) '' , `` 8 ^ ( bre ) / viii ^ ( bre ) '' , `` 9 ^ ( bre ) / ix ^ ( bre ) '' and `` x ^ ( bre ) '' are abbreviations for september , october , november and december respectively . 
   they use a sensible mm-dd most of the time , which is better and more familiar than dd-mm . 
  fun fact : preference towards mm.dd or dd.mm depends almost solely on person 's native language . 
  the reason americans prefer mm/dd and brits prefer dd/mm is because the former say `` january first '' and the latter say `` the first of january '' . 
   it was like 60 degrees how are you guys alive ? 
  actually , since 2015 online sales in eu have to be taxed depending on the country of purchase , so it can be anything from 17 % in luxembourg to 27 % in hungary . 
  but this highlights another issue : a game for $ 49.99 and $ 49.99 may be slightly cheaper in the us from the perspective of the customer , but it 's much cheaper in europe from the perspective of the seller . 
  often publishers make it $ 44.99 vs $ 49.99 , making it even worse . 
  but then , it makes sense : average net income in the eu is $ 1500/month , while in the us it is $ 3300/month . 
   especially with the 1e = 1usd which took 3 years to finally change ... well , that is no longer a problem , but for a totally different reason : today , $ 1 = $ 1.08 . 
  when the problem started , $ 1 was about $ 1.30 . 
   what 's the history with `` w '' instead of `` v '' ? 
  until mid-16th century , `` u '' and `` v '' were usually considered the same letter . 
  there are hundreds of words in polish that differ only by `` u '' vs `` w '' ( starting obviously with words `` u '' and `` w '' ) , so it would be confusing . 
  most of the current polish spelling system was designed in the 16th century . 
  the only very major change since then is introducing letter `` j '' instead of `` i '' / `` y '' for the consonant / j / in the early 19th century .

   according to my logic you are quilty in godvin 's law breaking .

  which is faulty logic , because all godwin laws states is that nazis * will * be mentioned .
