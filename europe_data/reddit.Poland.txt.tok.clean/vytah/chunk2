  `` you chose this guy and therefore he 's going to be an mp ? 
  nope ! '', 
   although in reality i would n't say anything because it 's nobodies business but mine and my employers . 
  yeah , that too . 
  as we say : `` stating pre-tax salary is like stating the length of your penis together with the spine . '' so , you can guess that here in poland we prefer to talk about salaries post-tax , especially since it 's employer 's job to actually pay all your income taxes and social security , so the money that lands in your account is already all yours . 
  pre-tax salary is an imaginary number which is neither what the employer pays nor what the employee can spend . 
  example : the average pre-tax salary in poland is 4000 z\u0142 / month . 
  every month , from that you subtract 660 z\u0142 for social security and health care , leaving about 3340 z\u0142 that is actually taxed . 
  the paid-in-advance tax is about 290 z\u0142 , so you are left with 2850 z\u0142 after taxes . 
  but the employer does n't pay only 4000 z\u0142 , they have to additionally pay more social security ( about 730 z\u0142 ) and other stuff ( about 100 z\u0142 ) , so the total cost for the employer is 4830 z\u0142 . 
  as you can see , the employer pays 4830 z\u0142 , the employee gets 2850 z\u0142 ( at least before the tax return ) , and the so-called `` pre-tax salary '' of 4000 z\u0142 is a meaningless number in between the two . 
  is n't that mostly because of immigration , ethnic minorities and another echo of the ww2 ? 
  `` united '' originally refers to the union of kingdoms of great britain and ireland , not england and scotland . 
  technically , it 's obsolete since 1927 . 
  union of kingdoms of scotland and england was called `` kingdom of great britain '' , without any `` united '' in sight .

  the funniest part is that un refers to macedonia as `` the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia '' and puts them not under m , because greeks protested , not under f , because macedonians protested , but under t , as in `` the '' .

  actually , seats are not split into constituencies before the elections , but after , using some complicated algorithm -- which means that if people in one region forget to vote , they wo n't have any mep . 
  the actual assigning of the seats to parties takes part on country level -- that 's why tv could give us correct seat counts after the results of country-wide exit polls only .

  it 's just that a name is something very valuable for a person ( or , as in this case , a bear ) that mangling it beyond recognition is wrong . 
  i could now go off on a tangent about adapting names and name spellings between different cultures , but i 'll pass . 
  i believe word `` voytek '' has one of the following origins : * someone transcribed it from russian version ( \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0435\u043a ) using rules for transcribing russian into english * someone , who did n't speak polish , transcribed it from the ear * someone wrote `` voytek '' as approximate pronunciation and some idiot mistook it later as the actual name of the bear * some pole was ashamed of his own language , in which case fuck him english does not modify foreign latin-alphabet words unless they use letters that do not exist in english ( like \u00fe , \u00f8 , \u00e6 , \u00f0 , \u0259 , \u014b , \u0142 ) . 
  this is not the case . 
  you do n't write `` yohan volfgang fon gete '' , you do n't write `` voytek '' . 
  anyway , perpetuating this egregious error is unacceptable . 
  who the hell is `` voytek '' ? 
  would you write `` henrick shenkevich '' next ?

   russian empire was a nightmare for all surrounding eastern european countries , including finland .

  i think that china would snatch the opportunity and annex taiwan . 
  and then maybe negotiate a pact with nato to get part of siberia in exchange for military aid . 
  that leaves pakistan and india , and i have no clue which side would they be on , especially since they dislike each other .

  fun fact : oblasts with the highest percentage of polish population ( although it 's still laughingly small ) are not those near the border ( lviv , ivanofrankivsk , volhynia , ternopil , all of which were parts of the second polish republic ) , but rivne and zhytomyr ( which were not ) . 
  so if poland were to receive the regions inhabited by the biggest ( yet still only symbolic ) polish minority , it would have to get a chunk of land that borders belarus but not poland , with no economic and faint historic ties to poland . 
  there are cryptocurrencies with built-in inflation .
