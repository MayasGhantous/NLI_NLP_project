  there are more polish native speakers than irish native speakers in ireland . 
  just sayin ' . 
  albania , armenia , czech republic , germany , liechtenstein , moldova , montenegro , poland , romania , russia , serbia . 
   switzerland you mean the swiss lake ? 
  `` step one : make serbs pay for it . '', 
  surprisingly or not , [ latvia ( or more accurately , courland ) actually tried building its own colonial empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/couronian_colonization ) , but it failed for obvious reasons . 
   the topic of immigration is becoming less and less relevant due to the declining number in refugee arrivals by the way . 
  as long as there are arrivals , it is becoming more and more relevant , not less . 
  it will start being less relevant when there are departures . 
  it 's like saying `` my debt situation is no longer critical , because in this year my debt grew less than in the previous year . '', 
  but it still grew . 
  given that many students are ~ ~ either in primary school or ~ ~ middle school , where only one foreign language is obligatory , i guess they 're learning english . 
  german is the second most popular language and it 's usually the second foreign language in middle and high schools , taught almost always in addition to english . 
  after the fall of communism , russian keeps getting less popular , first ( 1990 -- 2000 ) replaced by english , and now it 's being replaced mostly by german . 
  nowadays , majority of polish highschoolers learn german , but from what i know , after three years most of them ca n't speak more than just few words . 
  edit : noticed that the map says `` secondary education '' . 
  [ relevant jimmy carr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lqeid2mkkk ), 
  americans do n't dub foreign movies . 
  they either sub them , or more frequently ignore them until they decide to remake them . 
  for a tv show example , see deutschland 83 -- it was distributed subbed . 
  success is n't defined by '' / u/thelastgoodemperor wants to work for me '' . 
  they were more advanced and used teleportation . 
  they also usually have cheapest games on steam in the eu , and it was like that even before pound tanked due to brexit . 
  netflix subscription price is practically the same in the entire eu , with few cents of variation due to different currencies ( eur vs sek vs pln ) there are two exceptions : denmark , which pays more , and uk , which pays ** less ** . 
  so pay up , freeloader !, 
   may = kv\u011bten = blooming and then kwiecie\u0144 is april in polish . 
  i recommend checking out the list of units taking part in that operation . 
  i 'd do it myself , but i do n't care . 
  that 's why trump wants to build that wall : so all that wealth wo n't trickle down to mexico !, 
   gulag was terrible , but lets consider the soviet union is still ( at that time ) reeling from the effects of the october revolution and the civil war concentration camps were terrible , but lets consider germany is still ( at that time ) reeling from the effects of the lost great war , the versaille treaty and the financial crisis of 1929 . 
  please keep in mind that germany had to speed up it 's industrialization , otherwise , the poles and the french would have likely took them over very easily . 
  i am not trying to excuse hitler , but i would be cautious about drawing conclusions based on modern realities . 
  you know that most people in college are not college-educated ? 
  i mean , there 's a reason they went there . 
  and then they probably bought tons of belarussian camembert . 
  to be fair to op , the tabloid makes it look like this :  ** eu wants to ban : **  ** fries and chips ** ^ ( fried with brown edge )  ** bread ** ^ ( with too procured crust )  ^ ( overroasted ) ** coffee **, 
  lol . 
  after / r/socialism banning catgirls , / r/fullcommunism bans anime . 
  it just shows that whoever is at the top in a socialist group will start purges , and that fighting wrongthink is more important than getting anything done . 
  it 's telling that the only pro-ussr argument is `` hitler was worse '' . 
  i mean , setting really high bar here , is n't it ? 
   there was no other diacritic if your goal is to keep it compatible with central-european encodings , then \u00e9 and \u0119 are also free . 
  1 . \u0447 is more etymologically related to \u010d in other slavic languages , not \u0107 2 . \u011b for \u044d is also confusing , since \u011b palatalises a consonant and \u044d does not -- it will confuse all czech speakers 3 . in your scheme , \u0161o is ambiguous : \u0448\u0451 vs \u0448\u043e 4 . so is njo , this time also with pronunciation difference : \u043d\u044c\u043e vs \u043d\u0439\u043e , which might be a problem with cyrillised foreign names or compound words, 
  no , it 's not . 
  you want more pis or fidesz ? 
  because that 's how you get more pis and fidesz . 
  because chocolate is of lower quality here too . 
  the smog is not enough . 
   they are dutch citizens , with rights as dutch citizens . 
  this reminds me of a stereotypical american tourist who cries `` i 'm american !, 
  i have rights ! '', 
  after they break the law in a foreign country . 
  they wilfully broke syrian and iraqi law , so they should face the consequences . 
  also , it 's not like what they did was legal in the netherlands either . 
   otherwise as if that 's the only two options . 
  there 's a third one : since all of that happened in syria and iraq , let their judicial systems decide what is the appropriate treatment . 
  i bet those jihadist wo n't harm a single fly afterwards . 
  from the iraqi penal code :  article 190 - any person who attempts to overthrow by force or with the use of violence the constitutionally appointed republican regime or change the constitution of the state or the formation of the government is punishable by life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term of years . 
  if the offence is committed by a group using bombs , dynamite or other explosives or firearms , the penalty will be death or life imprisonment . 
  the penalty will be death if the offence results in any fatalities . 
   article 192 ( 1 ) any person who attempts to incite armed rebellion against the constitutionally appointed authorities or who is a member of a conspiracy or group aspiring to that end is punishable by imprisonment . 
  ( 2 ) if such rebellion actually occurs , then the penalty is life imprisonment . 
  ( 3 ) if such rebellion results in an armed confrontation with the armed forces of the state or in fatalities or if the offender is the commander in charge of an armed force , the penalty will be death . 
  i could n't find an english translation of the syrian penal code , but wikipedia claims that the capital penalty is for :  treason ; murder ; theft ; political acts such as bearing arms against syria in the ranks of the enemy , espionage , desertion of the armed forces to the enemy and acts of incitement under martial law or in wartime ; violent robbery ; rape ; membership in the muslim brotherhood ; drug trafficking . 
  i 'd consider investing in rope factories . 
  it 's mods ' decision that fixing such linguistic clusterfucks is not allowed . 
  the rule should be amended . 
  \\  implying he can understand those explanations `` your vote is converted to an element of an elliptic curve group and added to the blockchain using a hash function . '', 
   electronic voting at booths which is the worst of both worlds and they should be abolished . 
  [ except for this ugly and frequent sound . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guttural_r#french ) you can blame parisians for destroying your previously beautiful language . 
   why would one be bothered to learn dutch and voluntarily hurt their throat though ? 
  and it does less damage to throat than german , french or arabic . 
  most of the forest is younger than 100 years ( and i said `` forest '' , not `` trees '' ) . 
  there are some much older patches , but they under strict protection and no logging can be done there . 
   ` sh ' is the same sound as ` sz ' as that guy said you speak liquid after english . 
   which of those three sound alike ? 
  none . 
  nope , sh and sz are two different sounds : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_retroflex_sibilant the only major european languages that have sz-like sound in their default dialects are polish , russian , swedish and norwegian . 
  also , slovak and serbo-croatian have it in many , but not most dialects . 
  czech \u0161 , ukrainian \u0448 , german sch , french ch , hungarian s , albanian sh , catalan x etc. 
  sound like english sh . 
  the problem is that both greek and macedonian use ** k ** in the word that refers to those entities ( \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 and \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) . 
  who should budge ? 
  are you referring to this situation ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewb82hpise0 edit : a similar situation with irish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdr6_eeubdw, 
  why is it in front of an orthodox cathedral ? 
  i wonder if any irish or maltese meps will ever hear `` sprechen sie in einer offiziellen sprache , s ` il-vous-pla\u00eet . '', 
   in fact why is allah a male ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_gender most afroasiatic languages have exactly two genders : masculine and feminine , with masculine being less marked than feminine , therefore being a default for most living things . 
  [ the referenced scene ( in heavily accented polish with czech subtitles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhspzrtuydo ), 
  i like how the op proceeds to misspell * nachbar * . 
  `` defend our 125 day old culture ! '', 
  [ politics 101 ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/200/369/161.jpg ), 
  because dialects , demand for national identity , and different cultural traditions . 
  just like this : https://goldenageesgblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/6a00e54fd9f0598833017d42eb17db970c-800wi.jpg, 
  nothing . 
  in fact , it happens . 
  there are multiple companies doing that . 
  it mostly affects less perishable things , like sweets , coffee and cleaning products .
