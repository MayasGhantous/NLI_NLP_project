  lenin legalised it ( although probably not deliberately ) , stalin banned it again in 1934 ( some more muslim republics banned it earlier .

  as you noticed , sunday is obvious . 
  the remaining five days are all associated with five classical eastern elements , which are associated with five planets , which are associated with five roman deities , some of which are associated with norse deities . 
  for comparison , i included names of the days of the week in italian ; they 're similar in all romance languages day | day & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; | element | element | planet | planet / roman & nbsp ; deity | day | norse deity -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- tuesday | \u706b\u66dc\u65e5 | fire | \u706b | \u706b\u661f | mars | marted\u00ec | tyr wednesday | \u6c34\u66dc\u65e5 | water | \u6c34 | \u6c34\u661f | mercury | mercoled\u00ec | odin thursday | \u6728\u66dc\u65e5 | wood | \u6728 | \u6728\u661f | jupiter | gioved\u00ec ^ 1 | thor friday | \u91d1\u66dc\u65e5 | metal | \u91d1 | \u91d1\u661f | venus | venerd\u00ec | freya saturday | \u571f\u66dc\u65e5 | earth | \u571f | \u571f\u661f | saturn | sabato ^ 2 | -- ^ 1 from * iovis * , alternate name for * iupiter * ^ 2 * sabato * is a hebrew loanword , in latin it was * dies saturni * this naming scheme came to japan from china , but no one knows where the chinese got it from . 
  in fact , for some reason japanese names of the days of the week line up with the western european ones . 
  that 's why you have a 0 on the map . 
  that 's why i said  when all the sides in question are willing  it 's just people will have to want it . 
  right now , they do n't appear to . 
  i 'm not suggesting it will necessarily happen , it 's not like either side is going to be strongly pushing towards it . 
  i rather expect politicians in dublin , belfast and london dance around the issue for a very long time and wait for an opportunity to use that issue for their political gain . 
  i 'm just suggesting that when all the sides in question are willing , the process of uniting ireland will be simpler than that of germany . 
  do n't forget that east germany was a totalitarian state with socialist economy , separated from the west by minefields and barbed wire , much poorer than the west germany , and yet the process of unification ( including accession to the eec ) took only about a year , despite some westerners ' protests that the easterners would `` terk ther jerbs '' or something . 
  ( which they did . 
  but that 's irrelevant . ), 
  roi and ni are both democratic , both have developed economies , wealth difference is n't large , strong economic ties exist , laws are already partially harmonised due to the eu . 
  it 's just people will have to want it . 
  right now , they do n't appear to . 
  lem me just shift everything into the future tense and substitute few words : germany \u2192 ireland federal \u2192 \u2205 west \u2192 south  and tomorrow 's ireland will be the continuation of the republic of ireland ( south ireland ) . 
  this way , the entire land will retain its membership of the eu . 
  i fail to see a difference .

  were german citizens who moved to sudetenland between 1939 and 1944 given czechoslovakian citizenship after the war ? 
  the difference is that ukraine had no legal leeway to do so . 
  ukraine is the successor of the ukrainian ssr and they inherited all their citizens from it , there was no long-lasting modern ukrainian state before that , and the short-lived ones covered only part of the area of ukssr .

   however did nature survive until we came along to look after it ? 
  it did n't -- unless you 're hiding a t-rex in your backyard . 
  things changed , ecosystems were destroyed one after another and new ones appeared in their place , and no one cared , because no one had yet evolved the ability to care . 
  because the primeval part is just a small patch in the core of the forest . 
  most of the forest was planted relatively recently . 
   nature is cyclical no , it 's not . 
  nature is a chaotic system and if the balance tips in a wrong way , it destabilise the ecosystem permanently and lead to its collapse . 
   the beetles were never going to destroy the entire forest . 
  the primeval fragment of the forest is quite small and it 's surrounded by lots of forest planted in 19th century and it 's that newer forest that is in danger . 
  most of the bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest was planted in 19th century and it has large patches of spruce monoculture .

  if you take vat into account , then steam games in europe are a bit cheaper , although it 's only recently , after euro dropped below ~ $ 1.20 .

  american polls were pretty accurate . 
  they predicted clinton winning popular vote -- which she did -- and trump winning electoral vote -- which he did .
