  and potato never arrives in latvia . 
  such is life . 
   q2 2015 wait for fresh data . 
  a lot of people have arrived in q3 and they 'll be waiting quite a bit as well . 
  they 'll quickly rack up in extra miles from the airline companies . 
  given that except pis and po no other party can be sure that they get into the next sejm , all bets are off . 
  you can track the polls here : http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/, 
   there is literally nothing after finland except going back to iraq . 
  putin is not amused . 
   cultural taboos  hungarians consider their country as part of central europe , rather than eastern europe . 
  they should have included this for all countries they called `` eastern '' . 
  `` do we stay here in turkey ? '', 
  `` nope . '', 
  `` greece ? '', 
  `` nope . '', 
  `` what about macedonia ? '', 
  `` mace - what now ? '', 
  `` serbia ? '', 
  `` too much pasta . 
  `` too much lenin . '', 
  `` nope . '', 
  `` okay , we 're in that germany you always wanted to go . 
  do we stay here ? '', 
  `` it 's not as good as they were saying . 
  let 's try sweden . '', 
  `` i said sweden ! '', 
  `` okay , we 're in sweden . 
  do we stay ? '', 
  `` there 's only forest here !, 
  they said we 'll end up in a large city full of big-breasted blondes !, 
  fuck off , we 're going further ! '', 
  `` okay , we 're in finland . '', 
  `` it sucks even more than sweden . 
  nope . 
  what 's next ? '', 
  `` there 's nothing next . '', 
  `` what do you mean ? '', 
  `` well , there 's russia , but do you want to go to russia ? '', 
  '' ... '' '' ... '' `` we 're going home . '', 
  100 hrk = 13 eur in case anyone 's wondering . 
  is the criminal muslim ? 
  yes -- terrorist . 
  no -- not a terrorist . 
  finland was a third world country , together with austria , switzerland sweden , ireland , and yugoslavia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cold_war_alliances_mid-1975.svg, 
  that only means you picked words to loan that already sounded bit german . 
  elections are planned for 2018 . 
  germany sends people back , media : `` government uses violence to deport poor refugees ! '', 
  germany does n't send people back . 
  media : `` government traps syrians in poor living conditions , not allowing them to go back home ! '', 
  germany sends some people back , and some not , media : `` government separates families ! '', 
  german 's favourite fricatives are / \u00e7 / and / \u0283 / , but they 're only a part of the `` problem '' . 
  it also has quite an abundance of / g / , vocalic / n / , and / \u0250 / and either / \u0280 / or / \u0281 / for < r  -- at least those are the phonemes that sound harsh to me . 
  this made-up word would be extremely german : * geschr\u00f6rchen * / g\u0259 ' \u0283\u0281\u0153\u0250\u00e7n / , but there are existing ones that are quite german , too , like * eichh\u00f6rnchen * , * gegen * , * schwer * , * gern * , * grenzen * etc. 
  the fence is few metres into hungarian teritory . 
  this means that if they stand next to it , they 're in hungary , but if they go back to shoot a selfie with a nice view of wall in the background , they 're in serbia . 
  genders are not what makes french hard , it 's verb conjugations . 
  [ even polish is simpler than * that * . 
  ] ( http://www.linguasorb.com/french/verbs/conjugation/vouloir/ ), 
  so , all brits here ? 
  4chan would send them to north korea , like they tried to do with justin bieber . 
  it 's a reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fern_flower, 
  or northern balkan . 
  we 're still in the process of figuring this out . 
  add some onions and it 's great . 
  so i guess the following still would n't work : `` we started 4 hours ago !, 
  it 's already past lunch time !, 
  where were you ? '', 
  `` i was walking to work . 
  by the way , do you want to pay me overtime ? '', 
  `` so i 'd better be going then . 
   the majority of the polish , and funnily enough , czech jewish refugess went where ? 
  germany ? 
  nope . 
  france ? 
  nope . 
  they crossed the sea all the way to that island in the west . 
  maybe youve heard of it  they were economic `` migrants '' right ? 
  france was safe right ? 
  because its the country that passed the gas chambers ? 
  polish , czech , and other jews did n't flee to germany , because de facto they already had been in germany . 
  the german state they were fleeing from spred from bordeaux in the west , copenhagen in the north , brest in the east and vienna in the south . 
  do n't you ever dare again to suggest that the polish state had anything to with the violent persecution of the jews during the war . 
  and it does n't mean anything until the elections in 2018 . 
  sid meier 's polonization . 
   monarchy ( tyrany ) is bad for exactly the same reasons central planning is bad . 
  one person does n't have enough processing power nor information to manage everything . 
  this is not how monarchies work . 
  see any ceo of a large company for a modern equivalent . 
  open borders . 
  accept refugees . 
  refugees flee through the open borders to germany . 
  romania , yuo is of genius !, 
  but not right now . 
  aussies do n't . 
  to quote one of the migrants : `` romania is too cold . '', 
  we have summer . 
  now imagine a winter in a country more to the north . 
   but it does ask some valid questions . 
  the first question is dangerous for democracy if answered positively . 
  i 'll elaborate later if you disagree .
