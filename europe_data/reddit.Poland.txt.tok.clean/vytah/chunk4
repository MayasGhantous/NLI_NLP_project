  the second is the only valid one , but could be resolved without a referendum , especially since po suddenly says `` yes '' now , as if they could n't fix it years ago . 
  the third one is obvious , but the problem was solved few months ago anyway , so it 's also obsolete . 
   those are technicalities not relevant to entire country .

  fun thing : no matter how you count alde , poland is the least left-wing and most right-wing anyway .

  [ the tape scandal in hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny#.c5.90sz.c3.b6di_speech_and_resulting_riots ) was quite similar to ours and caused an immediate collapse of hungarian left . 
  so according to hungarian standards , po did have major fuckups . 
   poland ca n't waltz its way into the euro and start dictating policy , it might be a heavyweight one day but it is n't one yet . 
  poland joining today does n't give it an opportunity to shape the euro , it mostly just surrenders control that poland already has . 
  this . 
  adopting euro now would mean greece 2.0 pretty soon .

  given that russian is also official in belarus , i do n't know if belarus also has its own romanization scheme for russian .

  not necessarily . 
  poland had problems with small-scale corruption in the 80 's and early 90 's , but now it 's on western european levels . 
  middle-scale and high-scale corruption still runs rampant though . 
  i think romania follows a similar path .

  it 's not because `` ci '' would be pronounced differently -- `` ca '' , `` c\u0119 '' , `` c\u0105 '' would be too , and they do not get replaced with the - k - variants . 
  it 's because hard / k / turns into soft / k ' / before i , and therefore the spelling has to change to accomodate the new pronunciation . 
  the same with smith having locative smisie -- / s / turns into / \u015b / . 
  the rules are that the letter changes if the sound changes , and the change from hard / k / to soft / k / counts .

  til about [ latin monetary union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union ) . 
   greece also caused problems . 
  according to the bbc , `` its chronically weak economy meant successive greek governments responded by decreasing the amount of gold in their coins , thereby debasing their currency in relation to those of other nations in the union and in violation of the original agreement '' . 
  greece was formally expelled from the latin monetary union in 1908 . 
  it was readmitted in 1910 , however .
