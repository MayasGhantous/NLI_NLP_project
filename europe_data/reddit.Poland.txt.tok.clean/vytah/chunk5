   rent : 310 $ what are you renting ? 
  because it does n't sound bad . 
  $ 300 for food in bulgaria ? 
  that sounds a lot . 
  better idea : to avoid them transiting through the eu , we 'll tell them that the best place to live is russia . 
  the refugees from syria and iraq will simply pass through turkey , iran , azerbaijan and georgia , and arrive in chechnia or dagestan . 
  putin will have another opportunity to show his subjects what an amazing ruler he is and he 'll find accommodation and employment for the refugees in a very safe land of siberia . 
  and everyone 's happy . 
  what about having a trade agreement , but without all that corporate shit , and tossing ttip in the bin ? 
  [ we do n't take kindly to rainbows in here .

  adopted kids can get citizenship , too . 
  the question is : can a single mother 's kid be adopted by a second woman ? 
   art . 
  * an under-age foreigner , adopted by a person or persons who have polish citizenship , gains polish citizenship , if full adoption happened before they passed the age of 16 . 
  in such situation , it is assumed that the under-age foreigner has gained polish citizenship on the day of birth . 
  * so the question is : has the kid been adopted by the polish woman , or not ? 
  [ we need to hurry , or someone will beat us to it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zazhtt-duyo ), 
  it 's about the latter . 
  almost all online shops are in polish only , so say hello to a dictionary . 
  a good start would be ceneo.pl -- price comparison website . 
  but i bet most of the online stores either wo n't ship abroad or the shipping will eat the entire price difference . 
  also , the preferred payment method is wire transfer , which is free or very cheap for poles , but internationally it may end up being quite costly . 
   the wealth that was created back then and that we still enjoy today has been , at least partially , achieved on the backs of the former colonies . 
  former colonies , like poland ? 
  what about slovak exit ? 
   we could take all the children directly after birth and put them in orphanages and we end up with legally and morally grey area . 
  some countries already have very strict parenting regulations that allow to easily take children from their parents , but the aforementioned gypsy-laden countries are not one of these . 
   how can it be `` right '' and `` good '' to beat suspected ( or proven ) thieves up just because they are roma and/or fat ? 
  are you playing an ethnicity and/or weight card in lieu of them ? 
  is `` reservation with a fence '' an euphemism for a prison ? 
  there are gypsy villages/settlements in various countries of ce europe ( cz . 
  they usually become no-go zones . 
  the main problem is that it 's hard to get anyone out of those ghettos , so kids end up living their entire lives there with no chance of escape . 
  well , it * is * a different culture . 
  but i believe that cultures are not equal and not all cultures are worth protection . 
  explaining something with god is still explaining . 
  so by adding god you are actually destroying those mysteries , by saying `` because god did it , case solved '' . 
  that 's dumb . 
  but then , is manw\u00eb a god , when he 's actually only just another vala , second-in-command after eru , the creator ? 
  other valars look like they do more than manw\u00eb as well , for example aul\u00eb , yavanna or melkor . 
  southern half of the sakhalin island , kuril islands and tuva -- but all of them were parts of the russian empire or soviet russia at some point in history before the creation of the soviet union . 
  and the northern half of the northern eastern prussia , including the city of k\u00f6ningsberg . 
  it has never been a part of russia before ww2 .

  music industry is earning less and less , so it may be brought down : http://blog.thecurrent.org/files/2014/02/units-vs-dollars-riaa.jpg but no one will cry during the funeral , artists are shifting their revenue streams : http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shiftingsources2.jpg?ac780d and it 's artists and consumers who actually matters . 
  the middlemen can fuck right off . 
  star wars * screenplays * . 
  the movies are adaptations of the screenplays , so they have [ much more elements that are copyrightable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_films_in_the_public_domain_in_the_united_states#copyrightable_elements_of_a_film ) . 
  then it may turn into `` it 's not piracy if we kill him '' . 
  i can imagine at least several situations when this could lead to people profiting from carefully arranged accidents . 
  this reminds me of polish labour party ( ppp ) in 2007 . 
  ppp is known for never being in the media and always having full candidate lists in all districts . 
  they regularly get around 1 -- 2 % and never get any seat . 
  anyway , in 2007 parliamentary election they decided to put on top of their lists people with surnames identical to those of well-known politicians . 
  for example , they had at least 3 people with surname ziobro , hoping for elderly voters of pis to think they 're voting for zbigniew ziobro . 
  the fact that ppp had the list # 1 on the ballot probably helped . 
  the scheme kinda worked , but it was still not enough . 
  they definitely got more votes , but that did n't change the final results in any noticeable way . 
  italy and poland have special provisions for officially registered religious organisations . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_italy#freedom_of_religion_and_agreements_with_denominations ) , no muslim organisation has been registered in italy . 
  op * is * shadowbanned . 
  shadowbanning is what admins do to spammers and vote manipulators , and it looks exactly like what happened to op . 
  mods can not shadowban people . 
  i saw people referring to various subreddit anti-spam tactics as shadowbanning , but that 's a misuse of the term . 
  shadowbanning is exclusively an admin-only tool . 
  complaining . 
  if you are waiting for a bus which is late , complain about the bus company . 
  then , complain how the city council does nothing to pressure the company to fix the bus routes . 
  then , complain that the politicians from warsaw meddle with the city council to much . 
  and so on .

  the joke is that this is one of this guy 's tamer sides . 
  although i think the rationale of showing this particular one was to have no need of translation . 
  btw , do n't worry , this guy got only 3.26 % in last month 's presidential elections .

  that 's racist !, 
  for comparison , the far-right candidates ( 2 nationalists and 2 conservative ultraliberals ) got 5.07 % .
