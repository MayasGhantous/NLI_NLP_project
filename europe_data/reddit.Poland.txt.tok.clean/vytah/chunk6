  kukiz , the guy who got 20.8 % and was third , is also right-wing , somewhere between po and pis , but that was not an important part of his campaign . 
  two remaining candidates were centrist . 
  they got 1.8 % together . 
  the left may have some chances in the parliamentary elections this autumn , but most polls predict between zero to few mps for them . 
  some at least do n't indulge in cocksucking . 
  i do n't know if this one does . 
  sld keeps being treated as one by media , but that 's probably only till november . 
  i heard opinions that it will be absorbed by po pretty soon . 
  note : 3.8 % ** added all together ** . 
  po -- likes merkel and juncker ; epp in the european parliament pis -- likes cameron and orban ; ecr in the european parliament, 
  because let 's be frank -- neither candidate was in favour of any of that . 
  i think po ( including komorowski ) are more pro-ukraine , while pis ( including duda ) are more anti-russia . 
  it was before 1932 , when the prussian , austrian and russian penal codes were still in effect . 
  i have never heard about anyone being prosecuted on that basis though . 
  you can take a detour over romania , but i do n't think nato would look at it too kindly . 
   do any danes vocally support russian separatists ? 
  i think it would be comparable only if a bunch of andorran soldiers went for `` vacation '' to barcelona . 
  * [ grammar ] * a ** word ** used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause ( e.g. , and , but , if ) . 
  the shortest words in polish are prepositions * u * , * w * , * z * , * o * and conjunctions * i * and * a * . 
  greenland predicted that and left eec in 1985 .

  in poland , refugees are usually relocated into some sort of camps , not spread among the normal population . 
  the camps generally look and fell like ghettos .

  now we are sure we are getting * a debate about * jows , which will last until november . 
  ukraine . 
  the people in question are oligarchs . 
  you tell workers in your factory to vote for you and they do . 
  if you mean geralt , it 's as common as bilbo is in uk . 
  what is those signatures are from other trolls ? 
  they do it to conserve space . 
  other words are victims too : ** a ** us drone strike kills ** a ** man who claimed ** to have performed ** attacks ** on ** charlie hebdo ** and a ** kosher market . 
  this makes newspaper headlines sound unnatural , like some sort of newspeak . 
  hmm , newspeak , news-speak . 
  sounds the same . 
  i think maybe . 
  and [ kim jong-il 's true name is n't yuri irsenovich kim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kim_jong-il#birth ) . 
  [ which explains why this chinese bootleg copy of star wars has vader 's big `` no ! '', 
  subtitled as `` do not want '' . 
  we should start a media campaign : http://imgur.com/je7zjoe, 
   and no one will agree on olcation i suggest liberland . 
  there is none , but i just wanted to use tz since it was mentioned . 
  also , serbian and croatian vary from dialect to dialect . 
  i 'll fill out the table in a moment, 
  of course they would n't . 
  difference between \u0442\u0448 and \u0447 : not sure it you 're asking about a difference between retroflex , palato-alveolar and alveo-palatal consonants ( t\u0282 vs t\u0283 vs t\u0255 ) , or about a difference between afficate consonants and combinations stop + sibilant ( t\u0283 vs t.\u0283 or t\u0282 vs t.\u0282 ) . 
  in the first case , it 's about tounge shape : for \u0282 it 's touching the alveolar ridge and flat , for \u0283 it 's touching the alveolar ridge and domed , for \u0255 it 's fully domed and touching the middle of the palate . 
  in the second it 's a bit more subtle , but polish luckily has a minimal pair : [ * trzy * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/pl-trzy.ogg ) vs [ * czy * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/pl-czy.ogg ) ( direct audio links ) . 
  lem me draw a table . 
  -- also , you can categorise languages based on the * sh * sounds they use : languages that use \u0283 : english , french , german , hungarian , slovene , czech , slovak , latvian , finnish , ukrainian languages that use \u0282 and \u0283 : lithuanian languages that use \u0282 and \u0255 : polish , russian , mandarin chinese languages that use \u0255 : japanese, 
  i do n't understand what is that `` tz '' sound you are speaking of . 
  unless you 're speaking german , but you are n't . 
  anyway , the letter * c * ( * \u0446 * in cyrillic ) in those languages stands for some variant of [ voiceless alveolar affricate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_alveolar_affricate ) , which does n't exist as a phoneme in english and is usually approximated by letters `` ts '' . 
  also , in english * [ tzar ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsar#english ) * can be also spelt * tsar * , * czar * or * csar * , and pronounced with / s / , / z / or / ts / sound . 
  the russian word is * \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c * and english language can not handle this sound in the initial position . 
  most western systems of transliteration of cyrillic and japanese use * ts * for this sound . 
  probably shit comment, 
  i think macedonians can keep the name ( everyone knows what it 's referring to ) , but they should stop the whole chutzpa about alexander and the legacy of his empire . 
  the ancient macedonia just * happened * to be in the general area around skopje and thessaloniki , but that 's it -- those were different people , of different culture . 
  you ca n't claim to have everything in common with any random person that just happened to rent the same apartment you are currently renting . 
  the problem is that the same word : * lithuanian * is used both to refer to a member of the lithuanian nation and to a person who grew up in the area called lithuania . 
  let 's take mickiewicz for example : he was polish by etnicity , russian by citizenship , and lithuanian by the birthplace . 
  he considered lithuania a region within the sphere of polish culture . 
  in fact , if you check out `` pan tadeusz '' , multiple characters refer to various things/people being both polish and lithuanian -- but both of those words are used a bit differently , in different contexts . 
  i think the reason some belarussians want to claim the name * lithuanian * is because the last interesting thing that history books say of their ancestors is `` 14 century : got conquered by lithuanians '' . 
  a similar thing with irish : the ones from the north often call themselves british despite never setting their foot on britain . 
  eu is becoming a pole by making a pole the leader . 
  luxembourg can into colonial empire !, 
  he could do it with less military force by doing the same he did with besarabia in 1940 : just give an ultimatum to a weak , restructuring polish goverment after the war . 
  from purely practical point of view , not helping germany would lead to bigger german losses and no soviet losses , thus weakening germany before the anticipated strike on ussr . 
  or was controlling kresy for few years that important for stalin ? 
  i do n't know where you are getting the dates , but that 1914 map is definitely not * from * 1914 . 
  for starters , it uses post-revolutionary spelling . 
  edit : now i 've noticed : you got the maps from wikipedia and they 're dated there . 
  that was my point . 
  i just flipped the russian propaganda upside down and got something indistinguishable and from nazi point of view . 
  what russians must realise is that the soviet union and the third reich were more similar in their actions than they think . 
   renaming of streets except that most of those streets were actually renamed by communists . 
  most of them will get back their names they had before soviets . 
  nazi wehrmacht freed ukraine from soviet occupation . 
  the argument goes both ways . 
  read the article before trolling :  the legislation , which also targets nazi propaganda was adopted by 254 votes in favour in the 450-member parliament , or rada . 
   it bans all symbols and propaganda representing `` the totalitarian communist and nazi regimes '' -- from street names and flags , to monuments and plaques . 
  [ by extrapolation , every country will become finland by year 12000 .

  she said that it 's too dusty , but the real reason ( which she hid from you to not sound racist ) is that there are too many mexicans in spain . 
  especially since among the countries of the third world were austria , switzerland and yugoslavia . 
  on average , over 5 % of letters in polish texts are z 's . 
  it 's the 5th or 6th most common letter , beaten only by vowels aieo and maybe also by n . this is most likely the highest result for z among all the languages , beating even hungarian . 
  obviously , z is a 1-point tile in polish scrabble . 
  polish is the z-est . 
  maybe it 's not the prettiest , but compared to the ones bordering it ( german and french ) , it sounds really , really nice . 
   greek is the only language computers understand agreed . 
  i sometimes see some snippets of computer code , and it 's all greek to me .
