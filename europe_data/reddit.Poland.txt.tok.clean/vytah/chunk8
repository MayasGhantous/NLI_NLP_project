  the sex drive has evolved , long story short , to allow for and encourage sexual reproduction . 
  wiring in the brain that is responsible for the sex drive is almost always present , so infertile people will want to have sex . 
  so will infertile animals , even if they are of species that does n't have much fun during intercourse . 
  it 's not a choice , it 's an instinct , an urge , independent of most of their other bodily functions . 
  if sex did n't produce children , infertile people would n't even want to have sex . 
  in fact , fertile people would n't either , and there would be probably no word for sex at all . 
  and getting back to my use of words `` first of all '' : every woman experiences at least one pregnancy in her life , and during the first one ( and only the first one ) she 's experiencing it from the inner side of the process . 
  i specifically wanted to suggest that this is the pregnancy i 'm talking about . 
  and i agree it 's a strain on the body . 
  for both sides . 
   so that if you think people are going to stop having sex you 're either stupid or pretend to be . 
  of course they wo n't stop , it 's in their nature . 
  that nature 's goal is for that sex to end in birth . 
  it 's all the same basic animal instincts . 
  eat , survive , reproduce . 
  if those instincts did n't rule the human society , abortions would almost never happen . 
   you have absolutely no idea how pregnancy affects women . 
  first of all , it lets them be born . 
   walking on ice is n't basic bodily function . 
  so what ? 
  that 's even more of a reason to * not * classify pregnancies as accidents . 
  especially since everyone is capable to make sure that they do n't get pregnant . 
   now i know you 're male and/or grossly uneducated . 
  millions of women get through their pregnancies just fine every year , especially in first world countries , where they 're provided will all medical care they need . 
  and in the case problems might appear , as i said , exceptions . 
   contraceptives are n't 100 % sure but they give big chance that there wo n't be pregnancy . 
  ice is n't 100 % sure , but it gives a big chance that you wo n't drown while walking on the lake . 
  you now what gives even better odds ? 
  not trying to walk on the fucking lake . 
   and you did n't said why this access should be irrevokable . 
  why is leaving a baby alone with a slippery blanket in the middle of the woods illegal ? 
  you 're not harming it directly , and moreover you 're now allowing it to express its freedom . 
  why ca n't parental duty be irrevocable at will ? 
  compared to a baby outside the womb , the baby inside the womb is just a bit of weight and energy drain that does n't have other negative effects and does n't demand much of baby 's mother 's attention . 
  so if the former is irrevocable , so should the latter . 
  for all exceptions to what i 've said up to now , the law currently has an exception as well . 
   except some pregancies are accidents as there 's no fail-proof contraception . 
  accident is something unexpected . 
  with the reliability of popular contraception methods , pregnancies are expected . 
  it 's not an accident if you walk on a frozen lake and the ice crumbles . 
   you 're also implying that the access is irrevokable without any basis to it . 
  there are lots of commitments defined by the law that are hard to get rid of . 
  pregnancy is only one of them . 
  thanks to the sex ed , in which most students take part , you can reasonably assume that virtually every person above 16 years old knows where babies come from . 
  a person then willingly does the thing they know babies come from . 
  a baby comes from it . 
  * quelle surprise . 
  * if you do n't want to make a baby , do n't make a baby . 
  a pregnancy is not an accident , it 's always due to someone 's choice . 
  and by against , it does n't mean that they want liberalisation . 
  according to this : http://fakty.interia.pl/prasa/news-rzeczpospolita-czy-polacy-popieraja-zakaz-aborcji-sondaz,nid,2169854 30 % are in favour of more strict law . 
  translation : `` i am right , you are wrong , shut up . '', 
  fun fact : when romania banned abortion and contraception ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decree_770 ) , the birth rate skyrocketed , only to fall back to pre-ban levels later . 
  after it was legal again , the birth rate decreased again . 
  you always word the question in such a way that gives you the results you want . 
  applied statistics 101 . 
  you want to prevent people from seeing something by bringing attention to it , and it does n't work . 
  who would 've thunk it !, 
  in order for a fence to work , all frontier countries have to build it . 
  being the first one to actually do it would be a faux pas in certain circles , and it took someone who does n't care about what those circles think to take initiative . 
  so in some way , europe needs orban . 
  i 'm surprised albania gets mentioned only just now . 
  how 's the infrastructure along the coast ? 
  i can guess the rough area without any access to the telecom logs . 
  it was sent from molenbeek . 
  the art bikes . 
  because those logos are art . 
  and they portray bikes . 
  basic logic . 
  there was a video in this subreddit about how there are n't many prospects in living in greenland . 
  then , you can make greenland denmark 's australia . 
  while that is comedy , there exists an organisation which performs abortions on international waters : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_on_waves, 
  [ even the flag is similar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/flag_of_texas.svg/1024px-flag_of_texas.svg.png ), 
  what do abortion laws have to do with emigration , especially since many people migrate to ireland , which has almost identical abortion laws ? 
  edit : scratch that , not identical , ** stricter ** . 
  i 'll extract data from that article : should the abortion law be relaxed ? 
  gender | yes ( % ) | no ( % ) -- | -- :| -- : women | 53 | 25 men | 49 | 20 opinion on current abortion law : age | positive ( % ) | negative ( % ) -- | -- :| -- : 18 -- 24 |  50 |  30 25-34 | < 50 | < 50 45 -- 54 | 20 | 44 55 -- \u221e | ? | 56 should the law be made more strict ? 
  age | yes ( % ) -- | -- : 18 -- 34 |  30 35 -- 44 | 20 45 -- \u221e | < 20, 
  [ look at this manly man ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/beata_szyd%c5%82o_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-beata_szyd%c5%82o_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg ), 
  are you talking about jo or about mo , ` coz honestly i ca n't say . 
  talked with an angel ? 
  check . 
  dictated a holy book to his earliest followers ? 
  check . 
  updated version of christianity ? 
  check . 
  polygamy is now okay ? 
  check . 
  alcohol is bad ? 
  check . 
  fought military battles ? 
  check . 
  [ the u.s. had its own muhammad in the 19th century . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_smith ) he turned to be less violent that his precursor , but he was no angel either . 
  that 's normal for every ghettoised population . 
  we have roma ghettos all around europe , and i 'm yet to see a roma terrorist . 
   every day many times more people die in often preventable road accidents this is now . 
  and traffic-related death rates are dropping . 
  meanwhile , religion-based violence by muslims against non-muslims is on the rise in western europe . 
  do you want this ?
