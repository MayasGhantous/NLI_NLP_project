  how would you count the so-called stateless aliens ? 
  as russians , i.e. 
  born outside , or as born inside , which is what technically they are . 
  damn you , romania , you win this round !, 
  well of course , in latvia and estonia virtually everyone more than 12 years old was born outside the eu . 
  every stone that bounces off an unmovable wall can still hit something else . 
  confronting bad ideas usually does n't lead to the confronted person 's views being changed , but it may influence the onlookers . 
  ( which is also why i do n't engage in private debates any more . ), 
   i dare you to bring the enslaving argument . 
  how would mentioning the fact that muslims were enslaving europeans and sub-saharan africans for centuries , support his point ? 
  it could be worse . 
  the flag could 've been russian . 
  i do n't know if it will work , but i guess it 's worth a try . 
   the open society and liberal democracy did overcome the challenge from nazism no , it 's was a giant cooperation of capitalist resources and communist manpower who did that . 
   did overcome the challenge from leninism no , it was food shortages and other economic troubles which led to governments being overthrown . 
  also , see those victorious `` open societies and liberal democracies '' in russia , turkmenistan , belarus , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan and more . 
   and will overcome the challenge from islamism as well [ citation needed . ], 
  why ? 
  for them , it 's muslims vs infidels . 
  both of which they treat not as individuals , but as numbers , willing to sacrifice a small number of muslims to get rid of multiple infidels and spread islamism . 
  their goal is to have muslims join them and infidels either submit to them or die . 
  where do you draw a line though ? 
  sounds cheap . 
  do you get a lot of grocery tourism from poland , slovakia or hungary ? 
  true , treating isis seriously on the arena of international politics would be one of the worst things you could do . 
  accepting isis as a legitimate state , which can have its independent diplomatic stances , means they won . 
  isis announced war against 60 countries of so-called `` anti-islam coalition '' quite a long time ago . 
  most european countries were on that list . 
  therefore angela merkel is eastern europe . 
  let 's deport her , maybe it will help . 
  this . 
  it might look absurd for western europeans , but those people stick to their principles and believe that they are fighting the good fight -- and they have support of millions of other people , who share their principles , but are not quite sold on the active participation part yet . 
  but was this clock ever wrong ? 
   no , we are not `` falling down '' . 
  the war of the colonists from across the see against the native americans will be bitter and will regrettably take many lives of good people . 
  and in the end the native americans will be victorious , and we will wash down the pale-face colonists in the toilet of history . 
  the diagrams are based on [ surveys that have been conducted several times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_values_survey ) . 
  it 's only natural that different years will yield different results . 
  if you do n't like the chart , take the raw data and draw it yourself . 
  and i think poland sitting in the middle of the chart is quite accurate . 
  an average pole will find russians too xenophobic , westerners too tolerant , arabs too religious and eastern asians not religious enough . 
  why do you claim it 's ignorant ? 
  poland , in some respects , is quite similar to latin american countries , so its position on the chart does n't surprise me in the slightest . 
  give the component that displays the cookie notice a class or id ` cookienotice ` or any other from the plugin 's blacklist . 
  it works for some websites that are n't on the list though . 
  it even managed to prevent cookie clicker from displaying your current cookie count , so i had to ask the addon author to whitelist it . 
  just like in donetsk !, 
   sort of yeah because of common enemy . 
  except for all the time when soviet union was strongly cooperating with germany , i.e. 
  until late summer 1940 . 
  soviet union invaded finland , because the ribbentrop-molotov pact allowed for it . 
   opting out from next round of natural selection . 
  judging by the fertility rates , whole europe is opting out . 
  at least in poland , attitudes towards homosexuality among people in their twenties are not much different from attitudes among people in their fifties . 
  if the trend continues , it will take 50 -- 100 years before majority of poles will be ok with gay marriage . 
  * during the arrest the dutchmen did n't want to follow orders of the offices , they also reached to inner pockets of their jackets . 
  then the policemen decided to use tasers . 
  * lucky for them , if they were in ` murica , they 'd get shot , and if they could still move after that , they 'd be pinned to the ground , crushed and suffocated to death . 
  speaking of ` murica , that gun shop has the confederate flag on the wall . 
   meme do n't call it `` meme '' , call it `` former yugoslavian republic of meme '' . 
  north macedonia would n't even be that weird , we already have countries like south africa and east timor , without having a country named either north africa or west timor . 
  this works in german , but in greek and macedonian , there 's k used for both entities . 
  while i think greek can borrow this word and call the republic \u039c\u0251\u03c4\u03b6\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u0251\u03c2 , close enough to some foreign names , and distinct enough from the macedonian one , it would n't be enough , since it still does n't solve the issue of the names being identical in other languages , including macedonian , english , russian , chinese , arabic , spanish and french . 
  greece 's preferred solution would be to call the republic of macedonia something so unrelated to `` macedonia '' , so that other languages would be forced to follow suit and change the name of the country , but not of the region . 
  in fact , \u039c\u0251\u03c4\u03b6\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u0251\u03c2 could even cement the word `` macedonia '' in english , spanish , polish etc. 
  as more appropriate . 
   our children have become a minority and the principal said that 's why it has become so messy as it is so in order to stop the mess , whites should become majority again ? 
  cue obligatory arabic classes for swedes . 
  you used the wrong word : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ancestor you should 've used * descendant * , or maybe * heir * . 
  china 's fertility is below replacement rate . 
   `` todays macedonian slavs as alexanders ancestors '' holy time-travelling batman !, 
  former yugoslavian republic with name not including names of greek regions , fyrwninogr in short . 
  names are n't `` true '' . 
  a name is whatever word that people use to distinguish a single object from among other similar objects . 
  the word `` macedonia '' uniquely identifies one country from hundreds of others , so it 's a name . 
  so is fyrom . 
  as with all other words , the more popular will win , and there 's nothing wrong or good about it . 
  it 's just how languages work . 
  there used to be the holy roman empire , which was neither holy , nor roman , nor empire . 
  it 's calais all over again . 
  not sure about the biggest one , but one of the recent ones was [ amber gold ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/amber_gold ) . 
  i did n't follow the scandal when it blew up , but in short , a recidivist conman offered investments in gold and other precious metals , promising about 10 % a year . 
  after it was successfully running for years , having about a dozen thousand `` customers '' , the authorities noticed that amber gold is not fulfillling its formal obligations ( including filing taxes ) and then the whole scheme blew out . 
  money lost : over 800 million z\u0142 . 
  what makes it more interesting is the fact that amber gold did buy some gold , but they spent about 10 million on it and then a huge chunk of monery went to buy the [ olt express airline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olt_express ) , which employed donald tusk 's son . 
  a pro tip for those companies : the irish sea is n't that wide . 
  ireland has been the country of choice for multiple american it comapanies , featuring lower taxes and lower wages . 
  just set an office in dublin or cork and tell cameron to feck off . 
  of course not all companies will be able to do that , but those which remain in the uk will become less competitive compared to their foreign competitors, 
  according to that definition , 90 % of / r/popping is porn . 
  fixed spelling error :  she wants ** hordes ** of refugees you could also say , she * hoards hordes * . 
  it 's 60 euros per month , not 200 . 
  you get ~ 200 only if you add social security . 
  i think they 'd be interested in knowing that all refugee centres in poland are in the eastern part of the country . 
  so should the law allow for equal chances for both parents to prevent getting dragged into the relationship ? 
  if so , how ? 
  i 'm just leaving these questions and i wo n't mind if no one answers them , since the subject is multifaceted , ethically complex , controversial and biologically unfair . 
  you can be dragged into a legal relationship against your will after that fetus plops out of the female though . 
  what does it have to do with what i said ? 
  i said that men and women have the same legal responsibilities when it comes to the effects of pregnancy , yet only women can decide whether those effects will take place .
