  but i do like the idea . 
  i will believe it when i will see it happening . 
  some immigrants will never change . 
  bringing their conflicts with them . 
  way to go europe . 
  not . 
  yeah ... like that matters a lot in this case . 
  go on , try to discredit facts that calaisian is describing to you , and all you can write is `` right wing conference '' . 
  russia is the reason ? 
  mkay . 
  you should mention about reptilians and mole men . 
  they are responsible as well . 
  i meant dropping those immigrants there . 
  nope - turkish part of cyprus . 
  problem solved . 
   morning mood do n't hate me - i read it at first as `` morning wood '' and chuckled :p those three are really nice . 
   north koreans . 
  they do . 
  nk workers come with their `` guardian '' to take care about what `` degenerate capitalism '' could do to their minds . 
  i was pretty much disgusted when i heard about it . 
   workers . 
  minimal wage workers . 
  damn i missed some news . 
  it 's impossible number for employers . 
  on the margin - pis raised minimal wage to 12pln/h which would be ~ 8 pln net which is ~ 1.8 euro/h, 
  so what was the job ? 
  that 's because it branch has relatively high wages compared to other branches . 
  still - few of my friends with it education work abroad f.e. 
  two for london banks , both at high levels ( one is chief of security afair ) . 
  another one is key worker in m$ in washington , other one works for ericsson . 
  many young i.t. 
  educated people think about leaving , many stay because as i wrote it has quite decent wages for polish reality even at start . 
   the ones who move are low skilled workers . 
  you 're post is full of it mate . 
  in poland - highly skilled proffs move away as well because they can earn up to 8-10 times more in western europe . 
  polish blue collars starting from scratch abroad get more ( ppp wise ) then they get in poland with few years experience . 
  white collars have it even more . 
  exclude it branch . 
  forget about it , as well as forget about egypt or tunisia . 
  australia could be dropping them to that island and do nothing . 
  those illegal immigrants do that willingly , and they exactly know what they will get . 
  australia is not hiding it from anybody . 
  thanks to it they mostly stopped illegal immigration . 
  if you want fairness both sides have to play by the rules - if immigrants wo n't why would australia ? 
  same should be done in eu . 
   referendum with fptp question i wrote about the one related to this topic , and that one did not happen . 
  one you mention is irrelevant here , but nice try . 
  it would be all about question ( s ) and about terms used in it/them . 
  one word could diametrically change the outcome . 
   otherwise you get the same mess as in the usa or ** uk ** they did n't change their stance even after uk elections . 
  to be clear - there was a referendum about fptp - it was a parody of referendum , a mockery , with irrelevant and chaotic questions , ** no one at that time wanted ** , and less than 10 % people took part in it . 
  they ( kukiz ' 15 ) think thanks to it polish voters will be choosing nonparty local politicians `` that care '' , which would allow big parties to be cast in the nothingness . 
  it would be exactly opposite , but somehow they think it would be different with our lazy and mostly stupid voters . 
  my other [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/44szmw/the_referendum_is_on_bulgaria_has_a_chance_to/cztasaa ) . 
  * 2 000 000 + signatures : revoke new retirement age ( was 65/60 is 67 ) * 2 000 000 + signatures : make national forests unsellable ( to stop forests being sold to f.e. 
  repay national debt ) * 500 000 + signatures : revoke lowering school duty ( if that is what you call it in english ) from age 6 back to age 7 . 
  those are only from years 2013-2015 . 
  all three `` fucknololed '' . 
  oh - 750 000 + signatures about implementing fptp voting system in poland ( 2010 ) . 
  shared same fate as those above . 
  whether postulate was stupid or not , fact is former government did n't give a damn about what people wanted thus pis , being same shiz as po , won . 
  europe , while talking bullshit about poland , has no idea how bad po+psl government was . 
  edit : formatting , translation mistakes , etc. 
  i can guarantee you that once you stop with free welfare for everyone and give it only to citizens ( that are entitled to it ) , that `` half of the world '' will get down to legal migrants only . 
  no one would oppose that . 
  it is not your union . 
  germany is a part of it and seeing how german government created this whole mess makes people think what interest germany had in it to create this implosion of europe . 
  same in poland . 
  they `` fucknololed '' 3 000 000 + signatures referendum demand ... 
  politicians say something could be blessing - means a total lie to regular people . 
  good thing poland is n't in eurozone , good thing you are pushing uk towards brexit . 
  yeah . 
  handling the investigation by former government is what allows digging up this corpse again . 
  will have to check more about this . 
  thanks . 
  i agree with slovak gov as well . 
  it is the water . 
  it is strategic resource , as not-so-far-in-future wars will be fought for drinking water . 
  then again passing that constitution change after whole deal being successfully achieved looks like deliberate doing just to screw polish company . 
  i do n't see fact it was being discussed years before as something relevant - water is strategic , so why were talks taking so long ? 
  in this case logic is on your side , but law not that much . 
  i think that you will loose in ec and you will have some serious problem - which is more important : your constitution or eu law . 
  i agree . 
  at this moment we do have such language ( more or less ) - english . 
  no need to drop native languages thou . 
  yeah ... and we should just drop being polish and join some other nation . 
  come on man , do you `` listen to what you write '' ? 
  to simplify language for `` confused foreigners '' ... polish is pretty much learn-able , harder than other languages , but learn-able . 
  no one said it should be easy , else we all would learn esperanto in school . 
  ! someone different here !!, 
  just saying ...  arresting the poor & angry kids , that 's totally a priority i 'd say it would be more like example for others . 
  now , besides illegal immigrants , you have foreign `` angry kids '' to deal with . 
  seeing how jungle is being a problem , when it actually should n't be ( there should be no jungle ) , some serious action would be quite good . 
  riot police is n't to blame for bad politicians , is it ? 
  no one is making language harder , it is as it is . 
  like it , learn it or do n't . 
  dumbing it down for lazy people is n't bright thing to do . 
   `` nu\u017c w b\u017cuhu '' is amazing . 
  my eyes ... they bleed ... stop it please . 
  it is easy - learn how to decline `` nu\u017c '' and you will always know that it is spelled `` n\u00f3\u017c '' because `` no\u017ce '' o -  \u00f3 .
