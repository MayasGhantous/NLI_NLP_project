  with rz / \u017c most of the time `` after b , ch/h , d , g , j , k , p , t , w we write rz '' . 
  primary school rule thought to kids ( well ... it was like that 20 + years ago , no idea if they teach it this way now ) . 
  polish is one of the hardest languages , it is good to have such superpower , 
   would you say it 'd reasonable if england was the only one to decide what english is correct ? 
  in england - yes of course . 
  in other independent countries , why should england bother ? 
  if such process would happen in poland would you allow foreigners to have a part in discussion ? 
  i see no reason for that . 
  they use `` und '' at the last two ( zweiundneunzig in this case ) so you know when to switch digits . 
  this french system is da bomb thou :d, 
  tysi\u0105c ( 1000 ) dziewi\u0119\u0107set ( 900 ) dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t ( 90 ) dziewi\u0119\u0107 ( 9 ) = 1999 dwa tysi\u0105ce = 2000 just in case you 'd like to know how this does look in polish . 
  til french use twenty as base . 
  what do you mean by struggle ? 
  i know it may be small exemption but [ lidl ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34281559 ) pays living wage to it 's workers . 
  wikipedia says that all workers aged 25 + in uk will get living wage from april . 
  will that be still `` struggling '' in your opinion ? 
  i was n't even remotely comparing it to ee cost of living . 
  your minimal of 6.7 / hour would put you almost in the third tax bracket for the richest if you would earn that in poland . 
  ~ 9gbp/h would make you a `` rich '' person ( some standards given by some recent `` financial '' report ) in poland . 
  i was referring to fact that two people earning minimal in uk can rent a flat , dress with new clothes , eat decent food ( as not being forced to buy cheapest shiz in supermarkets ) , have some electronics , monthly ticket for transportation and most probably afford some vacations once a year . 
  all that excluding benefits . 
  oh and you have that 10k gbp tax limit . 
  this is why i wrote `` well enough '' and i 'm talking minimal 6.7 / h wage here . 
  if pair could get all that with minimal wage in f.e. 
  poland you would not have 800 000 poles living in uk , i can assure you that . 
  do many people aged 20-25 ( i heard living wage will be mandatory in uk for aged 25 + from this april , no ? ), 
  work on minimal wage ? 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  i mean it and i 'll be thankful for such til . 
  i do n't think you will exit eu , and i 'm not taking any side on this as both sides have some good arguments . 
  in the end it is uk 's citizens choice to make . 
  it 's one more year and anything can happen . 
   hell even inside of eu people leave their country because of employment . 
  2 000 000 + poles from poland since 2004 . 
  if i may ask - what do you do for a living ? 
  you wo n't buy agriculture land unless you are `` certified '' farmer and that may be rather hard for foreigner . 
  easier with development plots , but those are far more expensive ( for now from may 2016 you should have no trouble with buying dev . 
  plot ) , but still very much affordable for british . 
  with british wages you could easily afford to buy some cottage with near lake and small parcel ( 25-30k gbp - bargain offer , almost non-existent these days , with average being around 50-60k , 90 + + k when we talk about more popular and/or urbanised areas ) , but for those money i 'd say you can have far better weather in spain or croatia . 
  latter would be my choice . 
  you get paid well enough in uk doing any job mate . 
  afaik russian classics are translated to english and german pretty great . 
  according to modern day journalism i 'm a computer expert because i have knowledge of how to install proper drivers . 
  it would be obvious in such case but [ thomas strothotte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_strothotte ) ( if this is this thomas ) seems to be person that knows thing or two . 
  it makes it even more confusing . 
  your comment hits bullseye . 
  and that makes it scary . 
  do you have source for that comparison ? 
  going further with such scaling would mean their uni/tech uni diplomas are equivalents of our high school diploma at most which is imho huge gap in education ( what we can clearly see , still source is needed ) . 
  i like their logic - you take no refugees , we give you no monnies . 
  good luck with that kind of bribery and forcing sick policy attempts . 
  if german pms , for now economically most powerful country in eu , got access to it just recently then who the did all the talks before ? 
  just to put a nail to this coffin : [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/42xln8/isis_fighters_virtually_impossible_to_detect_as/ ), 
  it would be tough if you would want to do that in saudi arabia . 
  this is europe and here our laws are and should be supreme to islam . 
  i 'm not saying airplanes emission has small impact . 
  i 'm saying ( ~ ~ putting ~ ~ excluding natural causes like volcanoes ) animals at mega farms have bigger . 
  it would be easier to reduce amount of livestock , by changing just a bit our eating habits than to make people use less airplanes . 
  i should mention i 'm am very `` stubborn meat eater '' . 
  i 'd say people fly because they have to and they eat vast amounts of meat because they like to ( mostly ) . 
  imo but of course i may be wrong . 
   are you saying that cows and volcanoes are the things driving this unprecedented rise in global warming and climate change , rather than people nope . 
  i 'm saying that your idea about air planes wo n't make a big difference . 
   also , natural gas is only a profile when human beings burn them for energy . 
  it may be called natural gas , but it is n't naturally a problem for the environment methane is contributing to global warming ( or to overall green gas emission ) substantially , and i do n't recall cows or sheep having their asses on fire . 
  tell that to volcanoes , sheep , cows , natural gas leaks . 
  they seem unmoved . 
  good for her . 
  you ca n't be afraid to use any means necessary against scum like that . 
   i think 2000 was before negotiations . 
  7000 was after negotiations so po sucks at negotiating . 
   because you do not see bigger picture here . 
  or you are too much pc . 
   do n't have particular link in mind . 
  quick googling shows this for example . 
  italy and spain were struggling before big wave hit greece . 
  it was eu that silenced it all and refused to help them . 
  not poland . 
  irrelevant argument then . 
   poland does not contribute much 1 000 000 + skilled workers is not much ? 
  well ...  if eu has any sense we all need to collaborate . 
  of course . 
  let 's start from not doing things on your own that puts whole eu in jeopardy . 
  like germany did with immigrants , and like eu politicians did with silencing italy 's call for help . 
   do you even consider logistics ? 
  food , clothing , medicine . 
  just think about number of people to evaluate application . 
  security guards to protect camps , workers to set up tents , fences . 
  1 mln people it half of warsaw !, 
  yes , of course . 
  if such thing intimidate you , then you have seen nothing . 
  especially when we consider help from whole eu . 
  have you seen mekka pilgrims camp - 3 500 000 places in tents and we talk about less than third of that . 
  if they could do it whole of eu could do it without a problem . 
   poland agreed to take them | ... | if you volunteer to participate in something it is not mandatory . 
  it was decision made by politics , not by poland . 
  kukiz wants to have a referendum about this . 
  it may be smart move that will allow pis to scratch po 's decision . 
  this would be decision of poland . 
  of course there is this 50 % attendance requirement .
