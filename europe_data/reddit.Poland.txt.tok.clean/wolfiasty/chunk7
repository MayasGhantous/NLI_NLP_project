  not you  them . 
  greece is safe country , so everyone leaving greece for their own due north losses `` refugee '' status . 
  technically they loose it leaving turkey . 
  unless you are a fraud . 
  swedes seem to be ok with that , so why would anyone else care ? 
  still is - pensions for retired . 
  i know . 
  austria seems to be shaken out of this self annihilation run . 
  i am positive with their stance now . 
  ok with hungary but i would n't say that about austria - austria was with germany on cultural suicide side threatening central and eastern eu countries that they will not receive eu funds if they wo n't agree on forced quotes of immigrants . 
  those people most of the time worked in the past but are victims of transformation from 1989 and/or are most of the time older people living in poorest parts of country with next to no help from government . 
  poland : * before tax minimum wage for 2015 was 1750 pln/month ** ~ 405 euro ** ( ratings for today ) . 
  * after tax minimum wage was 1286 pln/month ** ~ 300 euro ** ( ratings for today ) . 
  vat is at 5 % , 8 % and 23 % . 
  i 'd say ( ! my speculation ! ), 
  average would be 17 % -18 % being ~ 15 % of total price for goods and services . 
  `` no tax limit '' was at 3091 pln which is 717 euro . 
  for . 
  whole.year . 
  not month . 
  in poland even those that are under existential minimum ( ~ 104 euro/month ) pay taxes ... 
  minimal wage for 2016 is set at 1850 pln ( with taxes of course ) . 
  riiiight . 
  that nicely fits to whole bs european politicians do these days . 
  good job france . 
  la liberte raped once again . 
   where do you think all this beautiful eu transfer money comes from ? 
  other 27 eu countries ? 
  well germany does n't want them anymore , same for austria and other countries on the way . 
  those people are staying in greece . 
  i thought that guy will get wet . 
  it turned out even better  cheers . 
  wow , look at all those submarines ... 
   you think that the other european countries having trouble dealing with immigrants posing as refugees are having trouble because of mushy feelings ? 
  yes , this exactly . 
  mushy feelings are the reason for whole crisis . 
  if central and western europe governments would not say f *** all the immigration rules , all of those immigrants would be stuck in greece . 
  it would be huge big problem for greece , but it would be far easier to deal with it . 
  hungary was first to oppose those feelings , they erected a wall last year . 
  now everyone north from greece are doing , if not did already , the same . 
  sweden and germany are about to close the borders . 
  refugee convention is either to change or to be ignored . 
  it works fine when one deals with few , dozen , a hundred refuges/asylum seekers , but not hundred of thousands economical immigrants posing to be refugees , proving how fake they are with their hostile actions . 
  genuine refugees are those that will be hit the most thou . 
   but other routes will emerge where ? 
  there is no other route . 
  not anymore . 
  no - other routes will not emerge as it is military on the borders now , as it should be from beginning . 
  immigrants will be stuck in greece . 
   dude you are ignoring what i 've said 2 times already : they ca n't turn them back to france if france is not willing to accept them . 
  they 'd be stuck in limbo , but on british soil . 
  dude , if you say disagreeing is ignoring then yes i am . 
  of course they can turn them back to france . 
  they are illegal immigrants that came from france , and france 's unwillingness to accept them back is no concern to anybody . 
  whole situation in calais `` jungle '' is french-made problem . 
  if it was n't for france 's passiveness those illegal immigrants would not be there in the first place . 
  france ca n't deal with illegal settlement of illegal immigrants on their own soil and would want to ship them to uk ? 
  please ... 
  you have your answer - money from eu budget , that came from regular people 's taxes , were transferred to fat cats , giving them their invested money back , and creating deficit for eu - for all eu citizens . 
  for each and every bailout in eu regular people paid/will pay ( deficit/loans will be paid up in time ) from their hard earned money . 
  such lovely scam . 
   they would have to deal with quite the flow themselves ( as i explained above ) and breaking these conventions is not something to do lightly . 
  i do disagree here . 
  imo britain will have next to no problem proving those people are n't genuine refugees or asylum seekers . 
  but it 's yours against mine here , and time will tell who was right in case of brexit happening . 
   and the flow would never really stop as long as the rest of europe does n't come with a united solution for it anyway it already has . 
  crude way but works , and greece is stuck with people they freely let in . 
  that summit on 7th of march will give some or none solutions . 
  does n't matter , as blockade is already set up on greece 's northern border . 
  italy had just few thousands immigrants since beginning of 2016 so that ai n't problem atm . 
   britain is far too desired as a location for many immigrants . 
  yes , exactly . 
  that is why they have immigration rules . 
  if we exchange words `` refugee/asylum seeker '' with more proper and real `` economical immigrant '' i 'd say 95 + % of them will be turned back on sight back to france . 
  all that in case of brexit . 
   bailed out the bond holders of the banks who were bond holders ? 
  europe ? 
  pfff - eu key politicians at most . 
  i believe that in case brexit will happen ( i 'd really would n't like that to become reality , but i can see what 's coming ... ) it will make few things far quicker , especially that one of leave campaign arguments is eu 's failed immigration policy and immigrants in general . 
  technically he had no vote over this , it was kopacz ( she was prime minister back then ) , same party , different person . 
  tusk as whole po was eu 's ( german mostly ) puppet so he played along with merkel 's , juncker and schulz narration . 
  tbh he is still on a leash , as his job depends from those three . 
  illegal immigrants are illegal immigrants . 
  after brexit i do n't think any british will have dilemmas of shipping those immigrants back to france . 
   it will just be synonymous with `` assertive '' it 's almost this already . 
  one of the rules i live by is `` believe what you want , but keep it as far as end of your nose '' . 
  i do n't care , just keep it for yourself . 
  and effin respect local traditions and laws . 
  if you wo n't - be gone . 
  refuge or `` refuge '' does n't matter . 
  lately disliking cultural suicide is racism , so i guess i am one . 
  i think you may be unaware of the standards russian can bare with , without being unhappy . 
  this way or another future will tell everything . 
  i fully agree . 
  ~ ~ further in this topic 's discussion someone suggests this article is phoney ( something with unreliable source ) , but such statement fits juncker . ~ ~ edit - i did n't check context :p thus ~ ~ for irrelevant parts . 
  that is n't exactly true . 
  russia gain very much from those if price is high but price is atm low and russia is still strong , as in has strong army . 
  nothing else matters . 
  you seem to underestimate putin and russians . 
  unless someone like gorbatchev or yeltsin will be next .
