  russia is strong when it has strong leader . . 
  even if junkcer did not say that ( but it sounds like him alright ) , it is perfectly obvious that ukraine is n't entering eu nor nato anywhere in close or even far future . 
  considering russia putin 's word is all that matters . 
  but you do know belarus is putin 's close ally , do n't you ? 
  sadly it is up to putin , not ukraine . 
  it 's obvious with ukraine , but i kinda dislike juncker 's tone ... 
  i heard they have red button in mission control . 
  we have many jealous people here mate . 
  kinda risky move ... , 
  then what is the problem ? 
  if you think ukrainians are that keen to be in russian army then they are already lost . 
  and in case you did n't notice - ukraine is pretending they are fighting with separatists . 
  if what you write would be true ukraine alone , without russia , would easily gather 100 000 ( it is way less than 780k ) soldiers and deal with those rebels . 
  but ukraine is weak , and those are facts , not some `` if x then y '' assumptions . 
  we have 2016 , not 1992 . 
  since then 24 years have passed . 
  i wrote that on purpose , no need to cite it . 
  who do you think elected those people and allows them to govern ? 
  ukrainian nationalism is strong . 
  one that needs help does not bite a hand that wants to help . 
  i think getting a mini bomb on an airplane is pretty much possible , especially when departure is from some terrorist-friendly country , but biggest problem would be with inside job - pilot being a terrorist . 
  we 've seen a pilot killing plane full of people because he had depression . 
  i see no reason same thing could n't happen because of pilot 's religious feelings . 
  checks nato ... yeah , right , biggest and most powerful military defence alliance on this planet , ok ... / mumbles ... [ philip breedlove ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_m._breedlove ) ... airforce , ok ... 4 stars general ... mhm ... commander of [ saceur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe&amp;redirect=no ) . . tia ... probably has some serious intelligence info on his desk daily ... / mumbles again ... 
  right . 
  so you you undermine his judgement because ... you are nobody in particular and you know better based on one article . 
  sounds legit . 
   they will appreciate the help erm ... poland helped postmaidan-ukraine a lot . 
  how much ukrainian government appreciated it - by glorifying [ stepan bandera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) and his companions an hour after polish president left ukrainian parliament . 
  i 'd say your wishful thinking is bit far from reality . 
   after all ukraine is a big country with 42m population that had no more than 5 000 soldiers ready to `` fight '' for crimea ... 
  even under russian influence ukraine pose absolutely no threat . 
  thanks mate for the info , i was n't sure what was the reason for those riots . 
  you know `` hit the table , scissors will answer '' :p, 
  just fyi - polish unemployment help consists of - if unemployment was n't your fault ( f.e. 
  your contract ended or company was closed ) you get around 60 euro / month for 6 months ( 120 euro if you worked legally for 5 years in total ) and the same amounts for 3 months after 3 months if you 've quit . 
  after that , more or less , you are on your own . 
  considering `` horses vs tanks '' held out for a month i 'd say it makes our soldiers effing badass . 
  sadly , we know what came after . 
  not really mate . 
  if french would want to move an inch out of maginot line you two would reach berlin quite fast . 
  seeing that stalin would most probably hold himself from attacking poland . 
  nazi germany would be done , millions of lives would be spared . 
  but we ca n't change history , let 's just not repeat it . 
  maybe you my dear ally . 
  commonwealth 's garrison was stationed inside kremlin for ca . 
  two years . 
  xsara picasso from 2005 with 55 liter tank . 
  i do n't have heavy leg , and when having a vacation drive from poland to croatia i am fine with 100-120 km/h . 
  fact i earn silly low encourages me even more to implement ecodriving . 
  bavaria or germany ? 
  gasoline is at regular price ( of course it will still be seen by american as expensive , but trust me on it ) everywhere in europe but italy and uk . 
  gasoline in italy was 50 % more expensive than everywhere around . 
  i refilled in croatia , went to venice , and next gas station stop was in austria ( thou i can go as far as 1100 km on one tank , beauty of 1.6 hdi engine ) . 
  shia and sunni are sworn enemies . 
  i could n't care less about their religious wars . 
  because if they pay same taxes they should receive same or bit lower at most benefits . 
  it they are n't willing to work or there is no work for them in germany - ship them back to where they came from no matter if that is eu or noneu person . 
  but be fair and do that with everybody . 
  police and military is afraid to act because accident may happen - wow , just wow . 
  stanley weiss is nobody considering global politics or military . 
  another journalist . 
  why do you care about his opinion ? 
  [ in 2014/2015 there were 696 americans studying in poland . 
  keep believing that . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.studyinpoland.pl/en/images/articles/2015-wzrost-liczby-studentow-zagranicznych.jpg ) , foreigners are around 2 % of all students in poland . 
  polish workers , poland stronk !, 
  / s ( or is it ), 
  czech will stay that way , france not so much . 
  take that into consideration . 
  no. 20 - giggled :d, 
  imo there are none . 
  there is one con - eu is not that great , and someone signed out . 
  if that would be the case ukraine would be no more . 
  again - baltics are in nato . 
  there will be no green men in nato countries . 
  putin would not start open war with half of the world over pipeline . 
  rus in what ? 
  we are in nato . 
  green men will be shot on sight . 
  imho somehow i feel sorry for british . 
  that decision is british only and it is up to you , but if you will say `` bye bye '' it will be very interesting time in europe for both uk and eu , and as much as i 'd like to see that , i 'm not sure i want that to happen . 
  it will be kinda selfish from you , continental europe will point at you for aftermath , but i ca n't and wo n't blame you . 
  decisions , decisions ... as for how it is portrayed in poland - national media portray it as some kind of success of polish primem , as she was supposedly negotiating very hard , and so on . 
  possibility of uk leaving eu - most say it wo n't be good thing to happen . 
  in the end i think i will hold my thumbs for imho overall [ better option ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_exw47qb4u0 ) . 
  britain bruh , we kan into space togetha in eu ( after some changes inside eu that will happen if we all press them power hungry hegemons :p ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ dislike ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ stance ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ poles ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ uk . 
  yes , that was 70-80 years ago . 
  we have f.e. 
  internet now , and those that joined are n't hunting with spears and living in caves in the middle of europe . 
   indoctrination is a powerful force . 
  agreed , besides what above , someone allowed for that . 
  he 's right about detesting stalin . 
  about rest - you bulldozed his world with reality . 
  he 's right about detesting stalin . 
  about rest - you bulldozed his world with reality . 
   now stalin was n't quite as bad as hitler as you will learn in history uhm you are trying to whitewash a cold murderer here that was exactly as bad as hitler . 
  depending on sources more people died thanks to stalin . 
  both were cold blooded monsters .
