  i could n't force myself to watch it , i tend to cringe really hard and it 'd probably take me hours to recover . 
  wow !, 
  this thread gave me tremendous feels ; _ ; life was so much simpler back in the 90s . 
  i never was .

  if you like statistics , here are the results from the last r/europe survey : http://redd.it/1x0c08, 
  not sure if i get your point , but i 'm pretty sure people who deal with money on a daily basis and accept foreign currencies are well trained to recognize and verify it , regardless of whether it 's a eurozone country or not . 
  it 's in their interest to be concerned about it , so we do n't need ads for that . 
  they could just release a pdf or something , and be done with it , which would be both less expensive and more informative for people who are actually going to be affected by the change . 
  holy pleb , so much drama over a 10 $ banknote . 
  everyone in the eurozone is going to * discover * it sooner or later , it 's frigging money . 
  yeah , i like sparkly things too , not necessarily getting hit by them though !, 
  there 's been quite a lot of news about poland posted here lately .

  he should appoint sikorski to teach him , lol . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant , probably should have stressed that better !, 
  reactions seem to be largely positive throughout europe . 
  supporters congratulate him on the success , while the opposition is happy he 's leaving poland . 
  everyone 's pleased !,

  i have a feeling the probability of supporting germany might be a function of people 's proximity to the west border , haha . 
  ( hello from bre ... um , wroc\u0142aw ! ), 
  when i was little , i remember someone telling me that germans do n't get jokes that involve any sort of absurdity , like if someone started telling a joke : `` two elephants are sitting on a tree branch ... '' , the german person would interrupt and say : `` vat ?!, 
  elephants on a tree ?!, 
  how vould they even get up there ?!, 
  are you stupid ?!, 
  that 's clearly impossible ! '', 
  [ ` yurp !, 
  nice save m8 . 
  _ why would one even do that ? _ seriously though , how do you like it here ?

  judging by the shape of the cartoon villain guy , he 's clearly never experienced any serious hunger in his life , otherwise he would n't be so resolute in his actions . 
  there are few things that piss me off more than wasting food . 
  just btw , the sheer number of videos that man produces is unbelievable . 
  almost every time i go on youtube , i see a new video by him in my subscription feed posted a few hours earlier , and he 's been doing this for years . 
  he also answers all questions people leave him in the comments . 
  that is some amazing dedication . 
  i learnt a ton from him . 
  bit uncalled for, 
  what 's even more funny/sad is all the downvotes , fucking hell . 
  the hivemind seems to go crazy over anything even slightly differing from the popular opinion , it 's ridiculous .
