  [ the portuguese armed forces confirm portuguese air space was violated ] ( http://www.emgfa.pt/pt/comunicados/2014-15 ) . 
   no it was not yes , it was . 
  portuguese air space was violated . 
  that is against the integrity of our territory and against the sovereignty of our nation . 
  as a people , we wo n't trade away our sovereignty and our freedom and we wo n't back down in defence of ourselves against foreign aggression by russia or by any other state for that matter . 
  russia would do the exact same thing if it was us the ones flying strike fighters and nuclear bombers over russian airspace . 
  now go away with your misinformation , putin shill . 
  you 're going to have to speak in english otherwise we ca n't understand you . 
   polish girl + erasmus student = love . 
  trust me , it 's true . 
  we have even jokes about it . 
  are you serious ? 
  what kind of jokes ? 
  i was erasmus and i lived with two polish girls , teraz ucz\u0119 si\u0119 po polsku . 
  as a recovering alcoholic who lived in italy , damn , what they drink in an whole year ( 29l ) is what my friends there and i must have drank every two weeks ( some 2l/day ) . 
   question is : will portugal be as irrelevant as scotland when it gets independence from spain ? 
  portugal has been independent and irrelevant for a long time now . 
   the economist is pretty shit and really right-wing though , what do you expect . 
  same thing with the torygraph forecasting doom and despair . 
  i suppose if you 're a socialist then anything that does n't fit into your ideology is propaganda . 
   what are these numbers based on ? 
  nothing concrete , it would seem . 
  [ the economist cartoon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hzt1aer.jpg ) . 
   [ the figures are taken from this study ( page 23 ) . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf )   since it 's a survey , some people might overestimate their level . 
  according to that page on that pdf , only 5 % of cypriots speak greek , only 10 % of germans speak german , only 6 % of irish speak english , only 16 % of spaniards speak spanish and only 10 % of brits speak english . 
  into the trash that whole survey goes . 
  til there 's no border between ireland and northern ireland . 
  that map 's definitely wrong . 
  portuguese people are much more fluent in english than spaniards , french or italians . 
  anyone who has lived abroad and been with people from these countries will tell you this . 
  heck , the french and the italians and specially the spanish always seem to stick together because they have problems communicating with everybody else whereas the portuguese have none of those difficulties . 
  that map is incredibly wrong . 
  really , portugal 27 % , below france or italy ? 
  portugal is closer to 72 % than to 27 % in english proficiency . 
   polish maybe ? 
  same here , depending on what you consider actually speaking a language , 3 to 6 : ** portuguese ** - no problems whatsoever . 
  born into it . 
  strong porto accent . 
  ** english ** - no problems whatsoever . 
  immersed myself into it . 
  european accent , changes slightly depending with whom i speak it with . 
  ** spanish ** - i 'm not used to writing in it but i 'm very used to communicating orally . 
  watched spanish cartoons , playing games with spanish subtitles and went to quite a lot of parties with spaniards . 
  mostly european but still slightly odd accent . 
  ** italian ** - easier than french to understand but when i speak it often some spanish comes out . 
  lived in italy for half an year . 
  odd spanish/foreign accent . 
  ** french ** - i have n't practised it in a while but i can still understand pretty much everything and speak and write without help for the most part . 
  learned it for 3 years in middle school . 
  funny odd accent . 
  ** polish ** - little vocabulary for plenty of things , still struggling with grammar and unable to understand most things when people speak to me fast . 
  started learning it on my own 2 months ago , lived and partied a fucking lot with poles . 
  surprisingly good accent for a beginner . 
  the exports map is definitely wrong and the english proficiency map is either incredibly outdated or wrong . 
  a lot of maps need to include croatia in the eu . 
  le chat est sous la table . 
  maybe we should do that in all the languages we speak . 
  what is the reason for choosing to show the pm in some countries and the president in others ? 
  does he shit gold ? 
   it looks uncomfortable . 
  a throne is not meant to be comfortable , aegon i targaryan said so . 
   uhm , is commemorating the right word ? 
  commemorate can be a false friend with portuguese . 
  while in portuguese `` comemorar '' means to celebrate happily and to rejoice something good that happened in the past , in english it can also be used to remember sad occasions , showing respect . 
   children are not able to make decisions for their own , they should be excused of course . 
  where would you draw the line ? 
   fighting for the nazi 's should result in jail , if they committed war crimes execution is a fitting punishment . 
  sadly , in real life , it 's never that straightforward . 
  the average soldier was just as guilty as the average victim . 
  on the defence of berlin , when the 3rd reich was down to pre-teen kids defending the city , did they still deserve capital punishment for fighting for the nazis and committing war crimes ? 
  it seems to me the real blame lies on those who forced them into that situation . 
   did you forget that they wanted to kill all slavs ? 
  what would you do if you were conscripted into the army and told to ~ ~ kill people you never met ~ ~ serve your country ? 
  would you refuse and be shot yourself for betraying your motherland or would you serve ? 
  it 's never good versus bad , most soldiers would have never gone to war in the first place , but if someone points a gun at you and says `` you 'll either kill slavs or we 'll kill you '' , i 'm guessing it 's just rational to value your life more than the lives of people you 've never met . 
  most people can be compelled to do the worst atrocities if they fear for their own life or the lives of their families . 
   you trickes me ? 
  i condemn you to drink dutch beer for the rest for the month . 
  damn , now what am i going to do with this tuborg ? 
   in all seriousness , i did n't see . 
  i have yet to play vic 2 . 
  i have played ck2 and eu4 but vic 2 never spoke to me . 
  to be honest i find eu3 and ck2 the most appealing , though vic2 can also be good , it 's focus is more on the economy , diplomacy and the scramble for africa and not so much on blobbing . 
  you should give it a try . 
   how in the name of beer and chocolate did this happen ?!, 
  in the name of beer and chocolate , i made this with console commands on purpose for that reply . 
  you can see that i did n't even bother setting a research or assigning the nf and that it 's the ahd start . 
  [ it could be worse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yttkt8u.png ), 
   my internal victoria 2 player is screaming . 
  [ no screaming now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bfmwzz9.png ) . 
   i tried to learn to read cyrillic once because it 's such a cool looking alphabet but the `` looks the same as latin but refers to a different sound '' characters are really annoying . 
  that also happens within the latin script . 
  for example , the `` j '' in portuguese and english reads the same but if you go to germany or poland they would read as `` i '' . 
  or your `` w '' , which they read as `` v '' . 
  and it can get worse , in portuguese for example , the `` o '' often reads as `` u '' but if you put an accent then '' \u00d3 '' reads as an open `` o '' . 
  that was quite confusing when i first started learning polish , in there it 's the exact opposite , the `` o '' reads as an open `` o '' and the '' \u00d3 '' reads as `` u '' . 
  but once you get over these main differences , it gets easier and much less frustrating . 
   language barrier is disappearing , friend .
