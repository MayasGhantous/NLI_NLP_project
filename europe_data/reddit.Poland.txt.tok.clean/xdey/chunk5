  in comparison , a decision made by 40-45 % of the population would be ideal under realistic circumstances . 
  under representative democracy , you have 0.001 % of the population making choices for 100 % of the population . 
   a direct democracy assumes everyone is an expert at anything . 
  and representative democracy assumes the representatives are an expert at choosing for the people . 
   if people absolutely hated what their politicians were doing they would vote for others . 
  wow , that 's so incredibly naive . 
   portugal here , we had it the other way around : `` and there 's the god theory , if you think you were created with magic lol good for you '' portugal here , i went to two religious schools and was always taught about darwinian natural selection . 
  i only learned about creationism on the internet later . 
   i think there 's a big difference between criticising something ( as in pensioners criticising the government ) and actively calling for withdrawal from or the dismantling of something ( as the daily mail does with the eu ) .

  just because people oppose government expenditures does n't mean they have to turn them down , they 're not stupid .

   nigel farage is also a libertarian ( e.g. 
  would like to make drugs legal in the uk etc ) though unfortunately libertarianism is not very popular in the uk and perhaps because of this ukip has become less libertarian in relation to its policies . 
  i know that , and i 'm not against him , my point is that all politicians ( even the ones i agree with ) are prone to allow themselves to get corrupted and once in power favour the interest of the ones who lobby them the most and not the ones who put them in office . 
  heck , if i ever got into politics , even i could n't assure that i would n't betray my own principles for political expediency or other tangible benefits . 
  regarding the eu , i have mixed feelings , on the one hand it 's excellent that there is freedom of movement of people , goods , services and capital within the europe and i 'm also a supported of the unified currency ( though i 'm against the control of the interest rates and would rather have a k-percent rule ) , but on the other hand the eu seems to be going down the federalisation road , which i 'd also be fine with if it were n't for the increased regulation and eu-level spending that accompanies it and the fact that it 's becoming more like the usa which has a federal government which is free to screw up the lives of its citizens and whose leaders are completely disconnected from the people who vote for them . 
  i 'd rather fix the eu than abolish it altogether though at the moment i do n't know what of those goals is more feasible . 
   nobody is planning on cutting off free trade with europe . 
  the eu currently has free trade agreements with half the world . 
  ftas are pages and pages long filled with regulations . 
  that 's 21st century protectionism . 
  you do n't need any that for free trade , you just need to lower/reduce all trade restrictions , unilaterally if needed be . 
   it does n't mean you ca n't have regulation to actually protect the little guy and his banking services from high risk speculators . 
  you can . 
  i 'm sorry for being sceptical but i truly do n't trust politicians , specially when they argue for simple and small things which are meant to help the little guy . 
  they all have their agendas and their own goals and they 'll always choose them over the interests of the common man , so even when nigel farage is saying that x regulation would be good because it would help the average joe against high risk speculators , i still do n't buy it . 
  from my perspective the best way to deal with this is to make it like every other contract , something is agreed upon and if one party does n't fulfil its obligations then they 'll either solve it among themselves or the justice system intervenes . 
  making a special regulation which is meant to be well-designed and to protect us from the special interests in the finance industry is probably the best way to actually screw people even more by restricting competition and by helping to make the big banks too big to fail . . we all know the influence that the financial sector has in government , we all know that it will be them and their lawyers the ones designing the law , that 's why i still am very sceptical about it . 
   glass-steagall is a regulatory system separating investment banking from retail banking . 
  i know what it is , i 'm just asking if you need laws saying `` banks ca n't be bailed-out at the expense of taxpayers and if they fail then the owners and the managers must be accountable '' when this is how it already is for other industries , it 's what i meant with regulation to deregulate . 
   `` why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother 's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye ? '', 
    luke 6:41 [ there is no god ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1q0c83v.gif ) . 
   only until the people realize that capitalism is not society friendly . 
  as opposed to what ? 
  social democracy where populist politicians promise everything and take away more in taxes than what they give back in government handouts ? 
   * banks : *   - a glass-stegall system introduced so no big bank every receives another bailout . 
  he wants to be able to let them fail , as long as the man on the highstreet is protected . 
  so he want regulation to deregulate ? 
   in britain , policy after the financial crisis has been decided at the level where it is being implemented , through democratic processes . 
  britain broadly voted for austerity , after the financial crisis , and it got it . 
  in the eurozone , really serious austerity was only implemented in a handful of countries , but the decisions were made elsewhere , either at a european level , or at the level of countries which are substantially unaffected . 
  no , the eurozone countries only got austerity when they voted for political parties which supported it . 
  [ portugal ( 2011 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2011 ) [ greece ( 2012 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_legislative_election,_june_2012 ) [ ireland ( 2011 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_general_election,_2011 ) [ spain ( 2011 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_general_election,_2011 ), 
   optimal currency unions need shared debt , common monetary , fiscal and political politics and huge internal transfers , shared responsibility for other stuff to , like school health care etc. 
  and they need this because ... ? 
  once upon a time the whole industrialised world was on a monetary union ( under a gold standard ) and at the time it was the fastest economic growth in the history of the world , so the idea that you need all that for a monetary union is bogus . 
  money is neutral . 
   the euro has nothing of that and ** i have always hated it ** , so do n't blame me . 
  there you go , it 's not a matter of it being good or bad , you just hate it , you 're an europhobe . 
   not checked , europe has many barriers to real labor mobility , namely language barriers . 
  language barriers ? 
  what 's next , the other place is too far away ? 
  that 's what 's called labour mobility , if you want to move and work in another place , you can . 
   not checked . 
  the cohesion funds are not nearly enough to offset the imbalances . 
  their also do n't work to solve problems like the current crisis . 
  so we 're supposed to beg germany and other european countries for more money even though they 're also struggling ? 
   not checked . 
  they do n't . 
  by that logic , the escudo in portugal is n't a proper currency union , the business cycle in lisbon is nothing like it is in the azores and the business cycle in algarve is nothing like it is in bragan\u00e7a . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area according to your link , the four often cited criteria for a successful currency union are :  labor mobility across the region . 
  [ check ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) . 
   openness with capital mobility and price and wage flexibility across the region . 
  [ check ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) . 
   a risk sharing system such as an automatic fiscal transfer mechanism to redistribute money to areas/sectors which have been adversely affected by the first two characteristics . 
  [ check ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_funds_and_cohesion_fund ) . 
   participant countries have similar business cycles . 
  so what exactly is the problem ? 
  it 's seems to me you 're just scapegoating everything on the euro . 
   i think it is sort of good . 
  not that i really wish ill on the germans but if all countries in the euro slow down perhaps a few more people will grasp the fact that the euro is a really badly constructed currency and act or quit . 
  when germany has it good and other countries have it bad , the blame is on the euro . 
  when germany has it bad , the blame is also on the euro . 
  tell me , what exactly makes the euro that bad ? 
  `` hurr durr it 's a badly constructed currency '' is n't an answer . 
   what he means with his sarcasm is that it has n't worked instantly , and is therefore not working . 
  spending other peoples money would have worked instantly , that 's socialism 101 . 
  nevermind if it would just create more problems down the road . 
  maybe my sarcasm is failing me , but i do think he was criticising the cuts as if they were the root of all the problems and not simple a consequence of the problems caused by government action such as excessive debt or inflexible labour markets . 
   that clearly displays how austerity worked for us . 
   thank you goldman sachs . 
  so let 's see if i understand your argument . 
  * greek electors vote for greek politicians who promise a lot of spending and not so many taxes . 
  * the greek government incurs frequent deficits and continues to accumulate debt . 
  * those who were willing to lend to the greek government started worrying about the risk of greek bonds . 
  * the greek government suddenly could n't finance itself and asked for imf help to get lower rates than they would elsewhere . 
  * the greek government was also required to increase tax rates and to decrease spending because the previous situation was unsustainable . 
  * this lead the greek economy to contract and unemployment to rise . 
  and you 're blaming ~ ~ the jews ~ ~ goldman sachs ?? 
   austerity is working flawlessly . 
  in 2011 , before they committed to austerity , they already had a 46 % youth unemployment rate . 
  here in portugal exports are increasing steadily , unemployment is coming down and the interest rates on government bonds are now at the lowest they 've been since 2010 before we were forced to call for help of the imf . 
   we 're doing somewhat better than portugal , last time i checked . 
  i did n't say otherwise , i was just refuting the `` everything is bad because of the euro '' argument . 
  how was it ? 
  tor vergata or sapienza ? 
  oh , wow , i just realised that the uk is doing so great unlike the eu which is so bad and it is all because of the euro . 
  what a load of crap . 
   i wonder why the us seems to to be exiting its great recession while spain and it 's euro buddies , excluding germania , seems to be running to rat shit ?
