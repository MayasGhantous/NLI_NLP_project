  [ portugal emerges from recession ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424127887323639704579012352926861682 ) [ spain ends two-year recession ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24740721 ) [ italian economy stops contracting ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304744304579249841952070888 ) [ greece forecasts it will emerge from recession in 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24430135 )  oh , and what 's the rate of inflation in the us just now ? 
    1.2 % [ usd monetary base ] ( http://i.imgur.com/um3ml8l.png ) anyway , you just completely ignored the fact that quantitative easing is issuing currency and giving it to the big banks . 
  if you were to explain how exactly that will be of any help , i 'm all ears . 
   the ecb really needs to get with some qe and turn this shit around . 
  i wonder how qe , aka issuing currency and giving it to the big banks and financial institutions , is meant to be the solution to the problems of an uncompetitive economy and the sovereign-debt crisis . 
  qe is the pinnacle of a trickle-down approach , it 's imposing the tax of inflation on everybody and giving the money to the financial sector , it 's absolutely ridiculous .

   i was unemployed in germany last year , then they made me 10hours/week clean shit up . 
  my point is , they make the statistics look good with part time jobs no one wants . 
  that also happens in other eu countries . 
   how would it look like for them without the eu ? 
  how would it look like for any eu country without the eu ? 
  i do n't think anyone knows for sure . 
  we could speculate , but i do n't see much point in doing that . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
   now do one with unemployment [ unemployment rate 2001-2012 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/2/20/unemployment_rate%2c_2001-2012_%28%25%29.png ) your point being ? 
   why would n't they . 
  they benefit the most out of the single market and currency .

  communism means poverty and misery , oppression and fear . 
  it 's nothing new . 
   mind you , none of the action took place in the netherlands dutch people not on weed are badass !, 
  i know that a lot of redditors are in programming and therefore supportive of the idea , but this sounds quite costly and the vast majority of people go to other areas where knowledge of programming is useless ( and i 'm also guessing that by the time they graduate , their knowledge will be somewhat obsolete , which is n't the case with other courses such as math ) , so this might not be such a good idea . 
   i never went to tomorowland but found this picture pretty intriguing . 
  so you 're belgian and you never went to tomorrowland ? 
  why ? 
   `` i accepted so many bribes that i ca n't remember all of them , '' former defense procurement official confesses during marathon testimony that implicates german , swedish and russian companies in a web of corruption with tens of millions of euros moved between german and swiss banks . 
    antonis kantas , the former deputy director of the mod 's procurement office , has admitted to accepting a bribe worth 1.5 million euros from a greek retired military officer representing companies including the german arms manufacturer rheinmetall over two procurement programs . 
  he also confessed to receiving a 1.7 million euro bribe for a third defense contract . 
  i do n't understand , so greek politicians are corrupt and get bribed and the blame is on the germans , the swedes and the russians ? 
   edit : i just realized that stockholm bloodbath is literally our 9/11 . 
  i recall [ a much more recent bloodbath in sweden ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9dmtnos.jpg ) . . 
   i have him tagged `` cultural superiority '' since he wrote this gem . 
  i 'm pretty sure he meant that as a joke . 
   yes i do know that , but i am certain that the jobs they do create can not employ the rest of their fellow immigrants . 
  therefore there will be further competition for existing jobs , which in turn will lower wages . 
  for someone that two posts up told someone to read up on basic economics and supply and demand , that 's a very ignorant assertion of you . 
  with more immigrants there is more offer for labour but there is also more consumers . 
  how do you even explain there being on the average much higher wage rates in big cities than in rural areas despite there being as well much more competition among workers ? 
  i do n't think that map is at all realistic as it not only assumes that the uk will leave , it also assumes scotland will leave with the uk . 
  not to mention turkey being in . 
   only if a major external threat appears . 
  the threat of eastern alliances or other military threats . 
  it may sound silly now but the believe me , that threat is very much serious and in a world with dwindling resources , climate change , extreme ideologies and advanced military technology . 
  it will take a miracle for it to not happen . 
  is this / r/conspiracy ? 
  all those things you 've mentioned have been going on for at least 100 years and in that time period europe has moved massively towards peace , integration , trade and cooperation . 
   switzerland 's banks will have to go bust . 
  i 'm not so sure that will happen . 
  and banking is only 6 % of their economy . 
   i think turkey should be included as well . 
  despite the obstacles facing it , i think it will join by 2030 . 
  i really doubt the eu is keen on expanding its borders to syria , iraq and iran . 
  why is croatia red ? 
  they 're in the eu . 
   if moldova gets in , transylvania gets out , and i 'd be ready to fight for that . 
  what the shit , man ? 
  really , war in 21st century europe ? 
   in all fairness historically speaking macedonia is almost entirely outside of the modern country . 
  same thing with poland . 
   i 'd argue the main risk is the rise of the right wing . 
  politics gets dragged to the right by die-hard libertarians and nationalists who refuse to negotiate but libertarians do n't oppose the free movement of people , in fact they support it alongside with the free movement of goods , services and capital . 
   the king is suposed to help bring neutrality to politics and the country , but if he 's corrupt , he 's counterproductive . 
  i do n't understand how in this day and age monarchs in constitutional monarchies can be corrupt - they can live a very comfortable life without ever having to work , why do they risk it all away when they 're already rich and are paid to do nothing ? 
   compare with this ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_hour_worked ) : the countries with the highest minimum wages also are the most productive . 
  those countries are not the most productive because they have the highest minimum wages but they have the highest minimum wages because they 're the most productive . 
  i 'm sure you 'd agree that if you tried to introduce a western european minimum wage on a south american country to try and improve productivity that the whole thing would go terribly wrong . 
  regardless of that , there are also very productive countries such as denmark , austria or sweden that have no national minimum wage whatsoever and they certainly seem to be doing fine without it . 
   you mean like the rest of europe ? 
  that 's not really an excuse , that other countries also discriminate against foreigners . 
  if the problem is people taking advantage of welfare benefits , then the obvious solution would be to reform welfare . 
  trying to fix that with changes in immigration policy and by treating foreigners as 2nd class citizens does n't fix the initial problem and creates an whole new one . 
   if a job is n't worth doing at a minimum wage , it 's not worth doing at all . 
  i 'm sure those who are unemployed and for some reason ca n't afford to continue education and the only jobs they can find require previous work experience would disagree with that statement . 
   when you 're confronted with a lot of unemployment a minimum wage puts a stop to the race to the bottom of all the wages . 
  how does a policy which causes unemployment prevents a race to the bottom ? 
  if anything , you should remove the minimum wage , if not for everybody , then at least to the younger and less skilled workers , so that they at least get a chance in the labour market and allow for unemployment to fall and force employers to compete with one another by raising the wages of their workers and to provide them with training which would improve their performance . 
   # 7.50 is what the scottish national party called the living wage . 
  the wage at which people need in order to have a quality standard of life . 
    i do n't think you can attribute the youth unemployment rates of the countries you mentioned to their minimum wage . 
  you did n't answer my question . 
  if the minimum wage at 7.50 # is a fundamentally good idea that raises the incomes of those who need it the most ( instead of getting them fired , which is what i 'm arguing ) , then why not for ( for example ) 10 # / hour ? 
  surely then you 'd raise the minimum standard of living even higher without , no ? 
   everyone 's labour is worth a minimum amount . 
  i 'll always stand by this . 
  yes , me too , the question who 's better at determining that minimum wage , if the snp or some other political party or if the worker itself and the several companies which may want to hire him . 
  after all , a labour contract is voluntary , both the employer and the employee may refuse if they think they 're getting a bad deal . 
  i 'd argue that since the minimum wage does cause unemployment and that since workers always wants to maximize their wages and will seek better employment alternatives if they think they 're being underpaid , that it 's definitely a better alternative to have no minimum wage than to have a price floor which throws people into unemployment . 
  if someone has some experience ( worth 8.5 # / hour on the labour market ) and is earning 6 # / hour , he will on his own move to a company that would pay him 8 # / hour , the state does n't have to establish a minimum wage here . 
  if someone has no experience ( worth 7 # / hour on the labour market ) and is earning 6 # / hour , he will move on his own to a company that would pay him higher , if the state were to set a minimum of 7.5 # / hour then no company would ever hire him and he would be unemployable , another example of a law which was supposed to help those who were the most in need but ended up making things considerably worse . 
   the wage should allow to live , and then to save well , i think wages should allow to much more than to just live , if it was possible , everyone should have a minimum wage of at least 1500 $ / month . 
  the problem is n't the objective , it 's the best way to get there . 
  if you think that by banning low wages , you 're helping lower skilled workers , then you must be delusional , that 's like thinking that you can end all alcohol and drug addictions by banning alcohol and drugs . 
   or it is slavery . 
  slavery means work without consent . 
  if a worker can at any time leave on his own , then it 's nothing like slavery . 
  and it 's just ludicrous to compare the enslavement under the active threat of violence and with shackles millions of people from different ethnicities and to force them to work from sunrise to sunset without any compensation and without any rights with a remuneration of for example 500 $ to an young worker who has days off , who often does n't work 35 hours/week and who has paid holidays in christmas and summer ( and to consider that this would all be fine if instead of 500 $ , it was 600 $ ) . 
   the least skilled are the most unemployable anyway . 
  no , it 's not , there 's a reason why countries such as switzerland , austria , germany , denmark , sweden , finland and norway , all of which have no national minimum wage whatsoever have youth unemployment rates from roughly 5 % to 10 % and countries such as portugal , spain and greece , with high minimum wages ( when compared to average income ) , have youth unemployment rates from 35 % to 60 % .
