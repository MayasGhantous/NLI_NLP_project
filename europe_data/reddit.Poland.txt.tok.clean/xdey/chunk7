  it 's not that people here are less skilled , it 's that , among other things , there 's a minimum wage and companies ca n't afford to hire inexperienced workers at the current minimum wage rate . 
   everyone 's time and labour is worth a certain amount . 
  and it 's around the # 8 mark . 
  except when it does n't and those people ca n't find a job even though they 'd rather have it . 
  but i 'm sure ideologues like you see that as fine , after all , we all know that 0 # is greater than 8 # and that the government must regulate these voluntary agreements where people are able to leave at any time whenever they find a better alternative . 
   and it 's around the # 8 mark . 
  why 8 # though ? 
  is that really acceptable in this day and age ? 
  some would argue that anything below 12 # / hour is exploitative and should be banned , would n't you agree ? 
   denmark has close to a de facto minimum wage , fwiw , because of the pervasiveness of union agreements . 
  the negotiated wage floor covers around 90 % of workers , and is currently set at 109 dkk/hr ( $ 14.60 / hr ) . 
  it only works as intended if it covers everybody . 
  in portugal over 90 % of the workers earn more than the minimum wage . 
  to these employees , there would be no difference whatsoever in exempting the remaining 10 % of workers from the minimum wage or abolishing it altogether . 
   as for the uk , that 's what happens when none of the parties in the parliament represent the working classes . 
  new labour are tories with red ties . 
  you seem to think that the minimum wage helps the working man when in fact it 's a price floor makes the least skilled unemployable . 
   why ? 
  because taxing foreigners the same way you tax nationals but treating them as 2nd class citizens who do n't get the same benefits as the rest of the taxpayers is active discrimination . 
   this group of people also tends to believe that the economic crisis can/could have been solved using ` keynesian economics ' . 
  martin keynes generally advocates for increased government spending in times of economic recession in order to stimulate growth . 
  martin keynes ? 
  surely you mean john maynard keynes . 
  anyway , keynesian economics in a sovereign debt crisis is literally trying to spend your way out of a recession , it 's as stupid as saying to a recovering alcoholic that the cure is more booze . 
  keynes ' ideas to solve a recession were valid in the 1930s when there was severe deflation ( roughly 10 % / year , for example from 1929 till 1933 the usd supply fell by a third and also about a third of us banks went bankrupt ) and governments had very low levels of debt ( on the us it was below 20 % of gdp ) , they are not at all valid in a recession which was caused by government spending and inability to finance themselves in the first place . 
   keynesians point to the failures of austerity and lassez fair economics in post ( 1918-1930 ) weimar germany and the failure of republican administrations in the us during the great depression . 
  just how laissez-faire failed if by that time everybody stepped further and further away from it ? 
  on the usa alone , there were [ farm subsidies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agricultural_marketing_act_of_1929 ) , tax hikes ( the top rate went [ from 25 % to 63 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_history_of_the_united_states#16th_amendment ) ) , record high tariffs ( like the [ smoot -- hawley tariff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smoot%e2%80%93hawley_tariff_act ) ) , a massive campaign of public works ( such as [ hoover dam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoover_dam#planning_and_agreements ) ) , [ limitations to immigration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_quota_act ) and [ expulsion of foreigners ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_repatriation ) . 
  all this while [ herbert hoover ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbert_hoover ) , the `` laissez-faire '' republican , was in charge , government spending was increasing greatly and the federal reserve was n't following the gold standard rules and stacking up gold without issuing currency . 
   they also point to the successes of president franklin d roosevelt in the 1930s to combat the great depression using large scale state intervention like setting up huge companies to employ people . 
  they also point to the economic success of western europe post 1945 using marshall aid . 
  perhaps these quotes from the [ 1932 us election ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1932#campaign ) will change your mind :  [ roosevelt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franklin_d._roosevelt ) lashed out at hoover : `` i accuse the present administration of being the greatest spending administration in peacetime in all our history . '', 
  [ garner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_nance_garner ) accused hoover of `` leading the country down the path of socialism . '', 
    in his addresses , hoover attacked roosevelt as a capitalist president who would only make the depression worse by decreasing taxes , reducing government intervention in the economy , promoting `` trade ( with ) the world '' , and cutting `` government -- federal and state and local '' not to mention that despite all the interventionism that took place both under hoover and roosevelt , the great depression only ended in the usa by world war 2 ( when unemployment came to next to zero with the male population fighting overseas and most of the production shifted to support the war effort ) with living standards stagnated through all this time - so there was no real improvement whatsoever . 
  as for the marshall plan , yes , the european economies did recover , it 's not like they could go below 0 , but by that token , so did the planned economies in eastern europe and the more laissez-faire places like some of the british colonies , even without marshall aid . 
  sorry for the wall of text but the failure of laissez-faire and the success of interventionism in the 1930s is one of the most propagated myths ever . 
  [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/0uxje ) 's where the video took place . 
   i do n't think politicians necessarily benefit from either left-wing or right-wing policy , just whatever helps their own business interests . 
  politicians in heavy regulated countries ( like for example in brazil ) basically run the economy , everything must go through them and so they can fill in their pockets with bribes or nothing gets done because of the bureaucratic mess . 
  politicians in countries like mine try to make everything appear in order but there 's always evidence of them colluding with business interests like for example when they pass legislation which makes it more difficult for new companies to enter the market or when they create some regulatory agency but it only goes after smaller companies which all help businesses that are already set up and then you also see relatives of politicians being hired in companies which have an interest on what the politician is deciding , donations to media groups to favour more some parties or criticise others or for example politicians retiring and then being offered a job in some company they used to regulate . 
  this does n't happen in countries like switzerland , if there 's very little to regulate then there 's also very little to bribe politicians for , companies focus not on lobbying but in competition and try to offer the best service , meaning that consumers benefit . 
  but that 's my opinion and i do am thinking of emigrating to switzerland so who knows ? 
   i 'm voting for the s&d not for them . 
  how are you going to vote for them , then ? 
  iirc , cdu and be are left and ps is the only portuguese one in s&d .  as i , as a lisboner , voted for mayor ant\u00f3nio costa and not for ps . 
  you do n't need to tell me on whom you vote for , i just personally think it 's silly and wrong to vote for a party which often argues that deficits do n't matter and that the government can spend money and not make it at the expense of the people . 
  psd and cds also have that problem a lot of the times but you understand what i 'm saying . 
   am agreement to govern the relationship between the eu and the uk in the event of a brexit . 
  it will need to cover a huge number of things . 
  i 'm also fairly eurosceptic but i have a dilemma as on the one hand , the bad things the eu does , portugal on the national level does even worse , but on the other hand , the eu is much larger and its politicians much more disconnected from their citizens and much more prone to caving in to the pressure of lobbies and special interest groups , and i certainly would n't want the eu to end up being another undemocratic and corrupt behemoth like the federal government of the usa , and unfortunately it seems to be heading in that direction . 
   i care about inequality , though . 
  free markets seem to exacerbate it . 
  i care about justice . 
  absolute equality does n't seem like a noble goal for me and i certainly ca n't draw a clear line between what degree of inequality should be accepted and what degree of inequality should not be tolerated . 
  i would much rather live on a system where the rules of the game are the same for everybody and accept the outcome because the rules were the same than live on a system where politicians are allowed to change the rules of the game to favour some at the expense of others and to redistribute the wealth as they see fit - which is often preached to be from the rich to the poor but in the background is always from the people to the politicians and the interest groups that support them . 
  so while in a freer market some people may end up much wealthier than others ( like for example in switzerland ) , i prefer that to an interventionist system which incentives corruption and where most people end up more equal but less wealthy and where a much more privileged class of politicians and big companies get incredibly wealthy ( like for example in portugal and in many other social democracies ) . 
   yes - it makes sense for both sides for the uk and reu to negotiate something new entirely . 
  negotiate what ? 
  keeping the borders open for the free movement of people , goods , services and capital ? 
   so he says you would find many elements catholics could agree with even in marxist ideology . 
  yup , you 're right . 
  i still disagree with him when he ( or the bible ) says things like `` greed is bad '' when i 've came to the conclusion that everybody is self-interested and will always act in their own behalf and the behalf of their children first and only later on the behalf of others and so imo anyone trying to fight against greed or self-interest is fighting an unwinnable battle . 
  though , on the other hand , i do was raised as a christian and one thing that i still try to follow is the golden rule and not do to others what i would n't want others to do to me . 
   but i was replying to the someone claiming that there is something ` interesting ' in not being ` catholic ' and ` socialist ' at the same time ( well , for me this way of thinking is interesting , as from what i observed in my life i find correlation between being socialist and being catholic rather low ) , so i thought that pius ' quote was extremly relevant there . 
  i think that pius said that because of marx 's claim that religion is the opium of the masses and the anti-religion stance many socialist states have taken . 
  which is somewhat ironic from my perspective , the most dogmatic people i know are socialists and communists and even though many of them claim they do n't believe in any gods , they sure do have a lot of faith in man-made governments and their scepticism often fades away with the promises of populist politicians . 
   not a fan of the most recent acts of the portuguese socialist party but i 'm going to vote for them the same . 
  stockholm syndrome much ? 
   why ? 
  [ the greens ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_mbwqhgga ), 
   it 's nothing strange , as pope pius xi wrote , `` no one can be at the same time a good catholic and a true socialist '' . 
  the recent pope said he 's not bothered when people call him a marxist , what do you say about that ? 
  not that i 'm against you , though i 'm an atheist , i think religion is a private thing and the state should be secular . 
  and i do fully agree with you on economic policy . 
   right-wing politics , especially in this country , seems to not care about the poorer people in society from my perspective . 
  i do n't know that much about scottish politics but from my perspective , centre-right parties are more sceptical of government action and prefer a more laissez-faire approach to the economy whereas the centre-left parties are more populist and prefer more interventionism and mixed economies . 
  and my personal opinion about that is that free markets do work for the benefit of the consumer whereas state-regulated markets are quickly corrupted and end up only working for the benefit of existing companies and politicians . 
   i was making a joke vis a vis the mitt romney `` corporations are people '' snafu . . 
  they certainly are made up of people , it 's not like companies are run by robots or lizards . 
   what are you talking about - tied to gold ? 
  [ gold standard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gold_standard#gold_exchange_standard ) it was akin to bretton woods though tied to gold and not to the usd and with a much harder peg ( with bretton woods countries could just set a different parity to the usd and devalue their currency whereas with gold there were more restrictions as the currency in circulation had to be backed by the gold reserves in the central bank ) . 
   and you are on purpose ignoring the enormous internal devaluation and the enormous unemployment in the south . 
  which is not caused by a monetary phenomenon ? 
  estonia and now latvia are in the eurozone and they 're both weaker economies than say spain or greece and yet even with the euro their unemployment is about average the eu and decreasing and they 're the countries growing the most . 
  so if you say `` the poorer southern european countries are worse off because of the euro being a strong currency '' and ignore all evidence of monetary systems which have worked and work without any issue despite several different countries taking part in it and even other european countries who are even worse than the southern european ones and also have the euro , then that 's ignoring hard evidence that your hypothesis is factually wrong . 
   what does that have to do with the free floating sek and the free pound and usd . 
  and you said yourself that our currencies work . 
  the sek works for sweden just as the usd works for the usa and the eur works for the eu , that 's my point . 
  the arguments which make you say the euro does n't work can also be used to say that the sek or the usd does n't work , and that would be ludicrous . 
   and you are on purpose ignoring the enormous internal devaluation and the enormous unemployment in the south . 
  that 's how economies readjust , to say that losing purchasing power to inflation is somehow better than losing purchasing power to unemployment is silly , one or the other is going to happen whenever governments overspend and then ca n't finance themselves properly . 
   doing as you and claiming the euro is good while ignoring that it is a badly constructed currency the euro is just as a good/bad constructed currency as any other ( like the sek or the usd , for example ) . 
  money is neutral and if monetary policy is n't going crazy ( say massively deflating or inflating the money supply ) then problems in the economy have real causes and not monetary ones . 
  portugal once shared a currency with the uk through the gold standard , and portugal was poorer than the uk not because of it but because back then we had higher tariffs , more interventionism and higher mismanagement of public funds . 
   the ez is to diverse to have the same currency without massive transfers and that one need political and financial integration too , that is wrong . 
  why do you keep ignoring all the monetary systems that have worked in the past despite back then also not existing any transfers of wealth or any political or financial integration ? 
   you see , stockholm transfers money to kiruna ( or in the exact case if kiruna , probably the other way around ) . 
  that is a transfer , so we will be equal . 
  ( ... ) that is why the sek works . 
  that is why the gbp works , the usd works and why the d-mark worked .
