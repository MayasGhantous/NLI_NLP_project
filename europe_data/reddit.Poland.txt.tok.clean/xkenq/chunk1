yeah , for example they tried to `` teach me '' about global warming , lol . 
  that 's what it will be , deal with it . 
  so you prefer when a politician keeps lying just go get into the parliament and steal money ? 
  democracy !, 
  seven times lower taxes , removal of slavery , free market , radical reduction of bureaucracy . 
  in the long term - bringing europe back to it 's roots together with other freedom parties like the czech svobodni . 
  why do i believe knp ? 
  because they repeat the same things for 25 years , they do not change their opinions to fit better into political system and lie to get votes . 
  i can trust them , and that is the most important point . 
  poland - 50 % of people between 18-25 voted for knp , a party with 7 % support . 
  the future is ours . 
  also , far-right does n't mean neo-nazi . 
  my party is far-right , but it has nothing to do with fascism , nazism , or anything of this sort . 
  ugh , the new polish prototype tank looks better :d, 
  my shitroom, 
  jawohl , mr. minitler !, 
  so hitler , pol pot , stalin , mao zedong and kim ir sen were good ? 
  proper name : `` union elections : six countries that went wrong , not right '', 
  the nominal gdp is very simple and inacurrate , you should rather look at this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) per capita , you also have to look at ppp . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita norway is only about 2 times richer in this aspect . 
  well , if the eu would n't have started to destabilize ukraine by sending nazis there , this whole civil war would n't have taken place . 
  well , polens gdp is almost three times higher than norway 's . 
  edit : * no , i do not support the olympics in cracow * , i 'm just saying that norway is n't a good comparison . 
  yes , we will blow the parliament up from the inside . 
  `` free trade is a policy in international markets in which governments ** do not restrict ** imports or exports '', 
  i want a strong , independent ukraine , seperating poland from russia . 
  not an eu ukraine , i do n't want to be surrounded by one superstate . 
  a strong , * independent * ukraine . 
  german efficiency - 0.2 % growth . 
  no , thanks . 
  both . 
  we live in a terrible socialist slavery system . 
  but yesterdays elections prove that europeans are waking up !, 
  the eu ( anti ) civilization is the opposite of the european civilization . 
  but the national front is very pro-europe . 
  this is ** great ** . 
  he can do a lot . 
  especially with the eu money , 
  jawohl , i will always vote for the king . 
  there is no free trade . 
  i ca n't grow cabbage and go sell it on the streets . 
  i guess the truth is n't always funny . 
  haha , good joke :d, 
  there was a time when the eu was a free-trade area . 
  i want that eu back . 
  beautiful !, 
  and my party - 7.2 % in poland !, 
  for the first time !, 
  europe is waking up !, 
  and ukip won in the uk !, 
  new right !, 
  free europe !, 
  good that he is pro-western . 
  polan - 7 % lol, 
  me being german does n't mean i ca n't live in poland : , 
  i am german . 
  said the one with an eu flag in his flair . 
  hypocrite . 
  900 billion wasted for the win !, 
  two more days and ... knp in the eu parlament !, 
  barosso massacred, 
  much tolerance wery leftist, 
  it is n't . 
  it already is n't profitable . 
  an europe superstate ca n't exist . 
  it will end just the same way the ussr/jugoslavia did . 
  people say hitler was evil , because he started the war . 
  hitler was evil because he was a national socialist , national socialism is one of the worst systems than can exist . 
  you are either a national socialist , or a democratic socialist . 
  which is pretty similar anyway . 
  you ca n't connect europe into one big country . 
  everyone knows how such things always ended . 
  with mass murder , and the `` supercountry '' going bancrupt . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you want a federal europe ( which is absolutely ** impossible ** by the way ) , you want the exact same thing hitler wanted . 
  but i am not eurosceptic . 
  i am unionsceptic . 
  i 'm making `` shitty '' references to your friend , adolf . 
  so being against executing hitler 's plan means acting like an idiot nowadays ? 
  putin , where is my pay ? 
  for none . 
  if you do n't want to help - at least do not destroy .

  of course china is growing - it has capitalism . 
  still , ukrainians and belarussians would really love to work here . 
  they are european , so they can integrate way easier than africans who live in ghettos . 
  it 's a fact , 70 % ( or something around that ) muslims in europe are on welfare . 
  just look at the population statistics . 
  lol , is this even serious ? 
  far-right parties are the exact opposite of hitler 's germany , while far left is copying most of it . 
  hitler was elected in ** d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-i-c ** elections . 
  hitler wanted ein europa , right parties want free europa . 
  now start downvoting me , hypocrites . 
  maybe there is still hope for france ? 
  if you think the xix century was mediaval ... 
  learn some history . 
  most of the people here are more fanatic than islamists . 
  i 'm choosing the lesser evil , that 's all . 
  heil merkel , right ? 
  ** i am a merciful god . 
  i did n't say russia is like europe was 100 years ago .
