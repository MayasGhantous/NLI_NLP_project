  60 % taxes , and unability to decide about your own life ? 
  yes , that 's slavery . 
  listen - if a company produces cabbage that is cheaper and better than mine - that 's something good , that 's rivalization and that is very good for the country . 
  there are always big companies that do n't like each other and are fighting . 
  one will eventually win and the prices will go up . 
  but then , small companies will have lower prices and will grow . 
  and that 's how it works . 
  __ when was the last time you did n't send your child to school ? 
  when was the last time you drove a car without the security thing which name i forgot ? 
  some of what you said i commented one comment above , the rest : `` openly speaking up about his disgust of disabled '' - he never said he ... has ... something against disabled people . 
  he just said that the money is being wasted , as usual . 
  ooh , that 's all xd well , after all of these things he said , he gained more supporters . 
  at first chaos , everyone hating him , but then when people realized what he actually meant - boom , support growing . 
  `` it was better during hitler 's reign '' he never . 
  ** n-e-v-e-r ** said anything like that . 
  he just said that there were lower taxes . 
  and that 's a fact . 
  `` let 's segragate disabled children '' he never said that either , the children belong to their parents and they decide what 's good and what 's bad for them . 
  `` women are inherently less intelligent than men '' yes , women are less intelligent than men . 
  and less creative . 
  there are natural differences . 
  that 's a fact , you ca n't deny it . 
  but women have a lot of things in which they are significantly better than men . 
  forced into working for a gigantic food industry ? 
  how ? 
  it 's obvious that if people will see a company is bad - they wo n't buy their products . 
  if you did n't notice : we all ** are ** slaves ** right now ** . 
  __ sorry that i am answering so slow , but i 've got a cooldown timer set at 10 minutes , because this sub is mainly a bandit union fanclub and i get downvoted to hell everytime i say the truth . 
  because what ? 
  i grow some cabbage and go sell it on the street . 
  someone wants it so i sell it to him , he gives me the money and suddenly - i 'm rich . 
  it is . 
  socialism is a system which heroically fights with problems that do not exist in any other system . 
  quran ( 22:19 -21 ) - but as for those who disbelieve , garments of fire will be cut out for them ; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads ; whereby that which is in their bellies , and their skins too , will be melted ; and for them are hooked rods of iron, 
  `` deeper understanding of world-wide politics and more importantly : economy '' higher taxes = less money = bad it 's so simple , really . 
  `` proud european '' huh ? 
  the only taxes that make sense are : from man ( around 50e/month , only from men , 1-68 years old ) , from ... uhh ... your land ? 
  however it 's called . 
  and that 's it . 
  and the taxes go only to the army , police , and judges . 
  no useless officials , no prisoners not doing anything . 
  prisoners work for themselves in prisons , otherwise they simply get no food . 
  no welfare support for lazy f * cks . 
  there should be no public schools nor a government education program . 
  also , your child is your child , you do n't need to send it to school . 
  it does n't belong to the government . 
  all roads should be private . 
  i know better what i need and what i want than the government does . 
  i 'm talking about absolute freedom , like in the xix century in usa . 
  i should be able to grow some cabbage and just go sell it on the street without registering it anywhere . 
  sorry for my english dude , like you see - it is n't my primary language . 
  i ca n't find it right now , i will continue later . 
  but what i can tell you right now is that 1/3 of brussels are already islamists . 
  ** note ** : i seriously hope that i am wrong about all this , i seriously hope that you are right , that europe wo n't be islamic within 50 years . 
  i really do . 
  i 'm propably poorer than you , living for 400e/month . 
  and you know what ? 
  without taxes , everything would be 30 % cheaper ( gas even more ) and i would live for 800e/month . 
  immediately . 
  so no - i 'm not rich . 
  i 'm poor . 
  great , maybe more people will vote for knp . 
  because noone should . 
  democracy is the worst system of all . 
  i know that may sound like i disrespect women or something . 
  it 's really not like that . 
  women are naturally more ... umm ... they like to be taken care of . 
  and that 's why they vote for socialists . 
  which simply destroys countries . 
  if only men would be allowed to vote , all socialists would be gone within a few years , and the western world would become alive again . 
  then , women can just come back to politics . 
  i have nothing against a female king , really . 
  also : i am not libertarian . 
  i am conservative liberal . 
  5 % of the country that for 1000 years was bringing christianity to whole europe now is muslim . 
  do you know what the birth rate of germans in germany is ? 
  around 1.5 ( i do n't remember exactly ) . 
  do you know what the birth rate of islamists ( that 's what you should call them ) in germany is ? 
  around 8.0 when you calculate everything - 1/3 of children born in whole europe will be islamist at 2025 . 
  in western europe this number will obviously be way higher because that 's where most of them are ( gigantic welfare and other shit ) . 
  `` well-educated immigrants '' yeah , i understand that those from poland or the czech republic or slovakia or hungary or maybe even romania are mostly educated , but ... dude , germany is drowning in islamists who just come there and abuse the welfare system . 
  which should n't even exist in the first place . 
  `` the problem of wealth inequality '' the problem of wealth inequality ? 
  `` equality '' is one of the worst things that mankind tried to introduce . 
  inequality is good . 
  very good . 
  yes , i do use it as toilet paper . 
  well , they know that they are crossing the border . 
  they also know what can happen to them - at best they can go to some rich european country and get welfare help for not doing anything , and at worst they will be deported . 
  if they know that our guards will shoot - it 's their choice to try and pass the border . 
  it 's their life , their decision . 
  and it 's their responsibility . 
  no need to guard all borders . 
  just the south . 
  and give the guards permission to fire real rounds . 
  edit : ahh , and the ones east from poland . 
  europe needs to close it 's outside borders . 
  period . 
  yes , this was meant to you . 
  you describe credits as something good .
