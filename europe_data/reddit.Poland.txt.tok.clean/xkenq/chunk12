  they are not good , no matter what . 
  great . 
  there will be a very big anti-tusk protest in warsaw on the 21 of march . 
  and it 's only the first one . 
  yes , china has still socialist elements . 
  but you can go with your cabbage and sell it on the street . 
  and get money . 
  investment investment is very good . 
  there is a difference between private investment and debts . 
  do you think the usa , from a country with rabbits and some wild men , became the most powerful country in the world , within 100 years ( ! ), 
  with foreign support ? 
  it became so powerful and rich because of the free market . 
  any ingerence of the country between the job-giver and the worker ca n't exist . 
  never . 
  yes , the american worker was being used as f * ck . 
  but you know what ? 
  the american worker drove cars as the first in the world . 
  why ? 
  because they were cheap . 
  ** do you think china , a country with 10 % growth , that was 30 times poorer than europe 20 years ago , and today is right behind the usa , had foreign support ? 
  no , it has a free market . 
  it 's fully capitalist . 
  easiest one would be death for murder . 
  just a few other examples would be freedom : children should belong to their parents , not to their government . 
  today in europe taxes are around 60 % . 
  do you f * cking know how much that is ? 
  100 years ago the highest taxes in the world were in austro-hungary and they were at 12 % . 
  and people were fleeing from there because of the evil taxes . 
  i ca n't even drive without the safety thing on me . 
  seriously ? 
  the european civilization was based around the simple rule `` nothing ventured nothing gained '' the thief union civilization is based around `` forewarned is forearmed '' which is terrible . 
  back when europe was normal , not ruled by socialist pigs , the human life was not the highest value . 
  as it should be . 
  back when europe was normal , we conquered the whole f * cking world . 
  back when europe was normal , it was 99 % christian/atheist , not 50 % christian/50 % taliban , and in the future 5 % christian/95 % taliban back when europe was normal there was no welfare support for lazy f * cks back when europe was normal you could grow some cabbage and go sell it on the streets without registering it anywhere we are slaves . 
  * edit : aah , i almost forgot - gender equality is bullshit *, 
  paying one debt with another ? 
  genius . 
  it 's very old . 
  why the hell do they want to join the eu so much ? 
  it 's obviously the worst . 
  you know why ? 
  because it is the exact opposite of the true european civilization . 
  even the arabic civilization is closer to europe . 
  it 's almost exactly the post i wanted to make a few days ago already . 
  this is ** r/europe ** not ** r/thiefunion ** for gods sake . 
  * the eu is the worst thing that ever happened to the european civilization *, 
  hahahaha , typical western brainwashed idiots . 
  the thieves from `` the capital '' love you . 
  `` you are talking about china , i assuma . 
  china is poor '' dude ... go into any shop and just look at any product . 
  what is written there ? 
  made in china . 
  everything is made in china . 
  china is n't poor . 
  china is cheap !, 
  `` yes , i am right '' i said you are right . 
  i am not sure what does human rights have to do with economic growth '' minimum wage for example has a terrible impact on the country and the people . 
  `` eus budget does n't even reach a trillion euros '' first - i said dollars . 
  second ( and more important ) - yeah . 
  language barrier , you know ? 
  i have no idea if it 's `` billion '' or `` trillion '' or whatever in english . 
  i know that it 's a lot of money completely wasted . 
  it destroys europe . 
  1500 years ago was 1500 years ago , 1000 years ago it was a giant empire with many free countries in it , 500 years ago it conquered the whole world , finally got rid of the arabs simply because it had it 's rules , for example death penalty for murder , `` nothing ventured nothing gained '' instead of `` forewarned is forearmed '' ( which is what the eu is trying to put into peoples heads ) . 
  150 years ago there were free , open borders ... oh , wait !, 
  meanwhile , europe conquered america , and from a country full of rabbits and wild people , within 100 years it became the worlds most powerful country , because it followed european rules ... go on : 150 years ago europe had free borders , freedom , no democracy . 
  it was beautiful . 
  and then 100 years ago something crashed . 
  something very bad happens . 
  socialists started rulling . 
  that 's when the downfall began . 
  `` enjoying massive investment in science and healthcare '' the country should n't have anything to do with healthcare . 
  it 's obvious `` free '' healthcare is just as dumb as democracy . 
  `` a poor market '' seriously ? 
  poor ? 
  dude ... `` eu is growing by 0.4 '' yeah , you 're right . 
  germany has -1 to -2 % . 
  just like most/all countries that accepted the human rights agreement ( or whatever it is called in english ) . 
  tell me which `` country '' wastes a trillion dollar on global warming ... that does n't exist ?!? 
  yeah , the `` european '' union . 
  oh , really ? 
  tell me which continent has 10 % growth ? 
  definitely not europe . 
  which continent has -1 % growth ? 
  definitely europe . 
  that 's the truth , you ca n't deny that . 
  i 'm proud to be european . 
  im pissed that the eu civilization is the exact opposite of the european civilization . 
  even the arabic civilization is closer . 
  f * ck the eu . 
  it destroys europe . 
  500 years ago europe conquered the whole world , today ? 
  today because of these f * cking `` european '' pigs it is being bought by china which has true capitalism . 
  `` but as for those who disbelieve , garments of fire will be cut out for them ; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads ; whereby that which is in their bellies , and their skins too , will be melted ; and for them are hooked rods of iron '' no problem . 
  i 'm so glad switzerland is closing it 's border . 
  time for other european countries to do the same !, 
  ( and kick out / youknowwho / by the way ),
