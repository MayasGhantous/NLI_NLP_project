  they went into a country 's capital and started screaming `` slava ukraina '' it 's pretty obvious that they got arrested :o, 
  merkel should be there too !, 
  no , it has no place , anywhere . 
  i mean - wait . 
  merkel can dig herself a hole in the ground , claim it her home , and place that flag inside it . 
  it 's already the most popular one in some french cities . 
  nah , deutsch sounds scary . 
  < kyh kyh  yeah , tell that to yourself . 
  no , seriously . 
  moscow looks like big warsaw , warsaw looks like small berlin , berlin looks like london . 
  kiev ? 
  well , kiev looks like ... chernobyl . 
  ukraine is just another world , basically what russia was 25 years ago .

  for a random pole the average ukrainian is an illegal pseudorussian emmigrant . 
  for me ... when i think about ukraine , i just immediately remember everything is illuminated , so - ukraine would be in much better shape if it would be polish ukraina , and not an independent country . 
  not trying to be a dick here , but i just think ukraine has absolutely no national identity , they only base it on being neither polish nor russian . 
  edit : no , ukraine is n't kievan russia . 
  kievan russia is russia . 
  ukraine is just the empty land between europe and russia . 
  in reality , west russia is far more western than ukraine ... ukraine is basically romania + turkey + czech republic, 
  swedish , nor ... wish , dutch , netherlan ... dish ... 
  i do n't see any difference between them , but they sound damn hilarious :d, 
  i want to see a similar one , but with the expected values in 2020 , and with china added . 
  rilidzyn of pis, 
  i 'm not talking about that bullshit gdp growth which does n't really measure the quality of life . 
  when communism fell , we were at a similar situation as ukraine . 
  after 10 years of almost-capitalism , we were already earning three times as much as the average ukrainian . 
  then socialism came back , and the pays did n't go higher in any significant way . 
  and taxes . 
  taxes went up !, 
  if we would keep that growth from the 90 's till today , we would be at germany 's level right now . 
  if we would open the market completely when communism fell , it is very possible that poland would become a world superpower , just like china did . 
  yes . 
  most poles in the uk are there because they could n't find a job in poland . 
  because far-right secretly means `` very right '' and far left means `` very wrong '' ? 
  people noticed our existence a looong time ago , really many people here would love to vote for us , but think this is a wasted vote , because our politicans have been repeating the same thing for so long , but we never managed to get above the required 5 % . 
  in the last months , when we finally , after years , hit 5 % , our support started growing very fast . 
  today , when it is certain that we will be in the eu parliament , we are already at around 8.4 % support , because people realize that the time for normality has come . 
  in the 90 's , we had like 7 % growth , then when we started preparing , we had around 2 % . 
  did n't change till today . 
  it would be negative , just like germany 's , if we would 've accepted some of the idiotic human rights agreements . 
  `` i 'm monarchist '' if you would n't be pro-bureaucracyunion , i would actually like you . 
  i can tell you , that because of the eu and it 's `` tolerance '' , once mighty austria is now , just like every other western union country , drowning in islamists , or like some leftists like to call them , `` muslims '' . 
  in a public school , with a public teaching plan . 
  great . 
  because liechtenstein , such a small country , without the eu , and what 's worst - without democracy , is sooooo boned ... 
  no , it is n't . 
  read about it . 
  1 . yes . 
  the purpose of road traffic is speed , not safety . 
  if it would be safety - then why the hell would we even invent cars ? 
  2 . they are . 
  3 . he did n't say he believes that , he just citated a theory , and of course propaganda manipulated his words . 
  4 . that 's absolutely true . 
  paraolympics have nothing to do with sports . 
  5 . it is n't perfect , there are bad kings . 
  but democracy is always stupid , because the majority is always stupid . 
  i 'm not anti american . 
  i am very pro-american . 
  `` voluntary association '' every country that signed the lisbon agreement ca n't exit the eu anymore . 
  the lisbon agreement makes the eu a country . 
  `` middle-school homophobia '' yeah , sure , good luck with your `` tolerant '' countries . 
  `` common market '' the eu is n't a common market . 
  i would have nothing ( i would even support it ) if it would be a common market . 
  it is a common extremely high bureaucracy and stupidity area , not a common market . 
  there is so much stuff i would need to point out ... seriously . 
  just ask any pole in the uk ( not from here of course , most of the poles here support either r\u00f3j much or po ) about why he emmigrated , and when he plans to come back , and he will answer `` i will come back once this piece of shit tusk goes to prison '' i guarantee you that . 
  just a random video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0kzefje4xs but , thank god , my party ( knp ) already has at least 8.4 % support , and once we will finally get into the eu parliament , it will go to around 20 % ( a lot of poles want to vote on knp , but , because we always had like 2 % support , they think it 's just a lost vote . 
  can you believe that ? 
  an anti government , anti eu , far-right party , which has the whole public tv against it , has 8.4 % support . 
  that 's just incredible . 
  the latest public tv manipulation once it became clear we will get into the eu parliament : http://www.cda.pl/video/12187767/janusz-korwin-mikke-w-fakty-tvn-11042014, 
  no , that is very understandable . 
  the eu is america 's dog , so i fully understand that you like it the way it is . 
  but being `` austrian first '' and liking the eu , that 's just kind of like an oxymoron , because the eu wants to remove countries and create a superhomoantieuropeanempire ( lol ), 
  this politican is an absolute and complete liar , never believe in anything he says . 
  even grodzkie is more believable . 
  every pole in the uk will tell you that he will come back once this thief goes to jail . 
  you ca n't be `` austrian first '' and like the eu . 
  just like knp is going to win the next sejm elections in poland . 
  bye bye thief union , 
  korwin will massacre you first, 
  exactly . 
  people think that / r/europe means r/europeanunion , and if you say anything against it they just pretty much want to kill you . 
  1 . freedom ... * whoops , i forgot there is no freedom in the eu *, 
  i hope they are reading all of my posts . 
  this is an uprising , lol . 
  that 's why some people think it 's putin who destabilized ukraine lol, 
  umm ... no ? 
  there were so many jews in iirp because the polish-lithuanian commonwealth was propably the most tolerant country in the world . 
  jews did n't build poland , they just lived there because it was safe . 
  still , i 've got a lot of respect for jews . 
  you can ask your friend hitler if he sees my posts too . 
  maybe you are just crazy and imagine this shit ? 
  dunno , ask adolf . 
  i just copied and pasted verses from both holy books . 
  all you can say is basically that i am stupid . 
  kinda proves my point , that political correctivness is cancer . 
  `` parents right to ... ** their ** kids ... has to stop '' you meant government kids ?
