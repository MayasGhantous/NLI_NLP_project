  so what , you think it is fine like it is now , right ? 
  no free will , just working animals forced to pay 80 % taxes , not even being able to choose if they want to use seatbelts or not ? 
  you are the perfect slave . 
  in europe you ca n't criticize democracy . 
  putin is definitely the best politican in the world that 's currently at power . 
  yes , if someone wants an unqualified doctor to perform a surgery on him - great . 
  it 's his choice . 
  i believe that every human has a brain and can decide for himself ( which socialists often forget ) . 
  any ingerence into the market is bad and anti-consumer . 
  another retarded , anti free market law . 
  < mental hospital  < outside world  which one would you call more normal ? 
  let 's not get into philosophy lol . 
  well , i guess it is better than in the middleages , but they were not the normal world . 
  the closest europe ever got to normality was in the xix century , also when europe ruled the world . 
  that 's how the world worked for thousands years . 
  how are they laughable ? 
  they are how a normal world works . 
  no slavery , but free people . 
  + these are not even ideas . 
  like i said , that 's how the normal world worked . 
  we , conservative liberals , just want it to come back . 
  a parent knows best what 's good for his child , a politician does n't . 
  children are being pretty much stolen from parents , and that 's one of the biggest reason why the birth rate in europe is so low . 
  the government should only care about the police , military , and courts . 
  pit needs to be removed because it is basically punishing those who work more . 
  the only tax that makes sense is the one where every man pays the same amount of money every month ( 100 euro for example ) for his protection . 
  also the tax for land , the more land you have , the higher tax ( still very low obviously , no more than 5 % ) because more land = more protection needed . 
  it 's that simple . 
  the us does n't have a fully private schooling system . 
  it has a government program and no parent can do anything about it . 
  in a normal world , a parent can choose what his child learns , and even if the child goes to school . 
  + there are extremely high taxes , the prices would be a lot lower without taxes . 
  hell , you ca n't even decide if you will or will not send your child to school !, 
  no sarcasm . 
  because the world became socialist-crazy . 
  they keep talking about how `` free '' we are because of `` democracy '' but we ca n't even decide whether we want to use seatbelts or not . 
  we are slaves . 
  private dormitory and private university instead of shitty dormitory and shitty university . 
  rivalization on a free market without taxes ( especially pit ) leads to high quality and low prices . 
  people could do that in the xix century too , and there was no thief union . 
  in a normal world , you can travel freely , you can have a job , get married , make a shop , even sell drugs , without registering it anywhere , and without paying any taxes for it . 
  yea , i will definitely travel outside of the eu borders ... mhm ... maybe to liechtenstein ? 
  no democracy , no bandit union , and it is absolutely awesome , the richest country in europe !, 
  better not take any money away from the people and let them live their own lifes . 
  it is democratic . 
  if the majority wants it , noone ca n't do anything about it . 
  north korea is an extremely socialist country , even more than europe today . 
  it is funny that people in europe think they are free because of democracy , but later they go inside their car , and ca n't even choose if they want to use seatbelts or not . 
  and then have children , and ca n't even choose if they should go to school or not . 
  aaand pay 80 % taxes . 
  i want to be free . 
  you do n't understand one simple thing - democracy is about the majority voting for the government to decide what to allow and what to forbid . 
  `` marihuana is bad , we do n't want it ! '', 
  `` marihuana is n't that bad , we want it ! '', 
  in a normal world , a human can decide whether he wants to use it or not . 
  in a normal world , a human can decide whether he wants to use metaamfitamine or not . 
  he is not a slave . 
  he is a thinking human . 
  just like with the wars between atheist and religious parties - `` children should have more religion in schools !, 
  we will do that ! '', 
  `` children should have none religion in schools !, 
  we will do that ! '', 
  in a normal world , a parent can send his child to whatever school he wants , with whichever teaching plan , it 's his child , not government property . 
  or , well , not send his child to school at all . 
  indeed , america within 100 years from a country with some wild men and rabbits turned into the worlds superpower . 
  that was because it was following european rules . 
  ** volenti non fit iniuria ** europe was getting more and more socialist in the xix century , while , like i said , usa was following the old , true european rules . 
  of course later socialists started ruling in the usa too ( income tax and other bullshit ... ) but , well ... that was a bit later . 
  reagan rebuilt america a bit when he was ruling , but of course obama ( propably the worst american president in history ) is destroying it again . 
  yes , it would certainly be better if one person would decide everything . 
  democracy has nothing to do with peoples fundamental rights . 
  it 's the exact opposite - they can be removed in a democratic way . 
  in a normal country the most important thing is the law , then there is the king/emperor/whatever you call him . 
  there are good and bad monarchies , i agree . 
  but democracy is ** always ** stupid . 
  because the majority is ** always ** stupid . 
  breivik loves these rights , killed 70 people and now is enjoying his holiday in prison , while he should be hanged immediately , just like every murderer . 
  democracy is a totalitarian system . 
  you do n't have anything to say about how things run in your country with democracy . 
  if there are two men and one woman in a room , they can start a democratic vote if they can rape her . 
  both agree . 
  the woman disagrees . 
  and they rightfully rape her . 
  that 's democracy . 
  oh , so that 's how it is !, 
  you are just gon na repeat the same questions all over again and pretend i did n't answer them twice already !, 
  goodbye then . 
  `` no , because other countries are growing '' dude , how can you be so ... so ... ignorant ? 
  i ca n't believe that . 
  why is n't europe growing ? 
  because it ca n't !, 
  we are robbing working people by making them pay higher taxes , god dammit !, 
  it 's a wonder anyone still works !, 
  `` you wrote about growth '' did you see europe 's debt ? 
  `` and you base it on what '' umm ... on what i wrote above ? 
  `` you disagree with the majority of climate scientists '' hey , scientist !, 
  are you poor because of extremely high taxes ? 
  do you want to get rich ? 
  - yeah !, 
  k , just say that global warming is caused by humans , and then we will steal funds for fighting it , and this way we can chop some of that money off for you !,
