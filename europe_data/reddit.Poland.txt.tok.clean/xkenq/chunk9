  `` this is n't the competence of the union '' it is . 
  for example the minimum vat eu members can set is 15 % . 
  `` it would change a lot '' we would be represented by a weak , dying shadow of a once dominant civilization . 
  i am not sure what you are talking about . 
  what bandits '' ? 
  it had tons of people when mao zedong ruled too , does n't mean it was powerful . 
  it was extremely poor , actually . 
  because it was socialist . 
  i am not sure how did you make the connection with him and european parties . '', 
  + `` you did n't provide a source . 
  your claim was taht socialists and communists rule europe . 
  who are they '' i just wrote a list of parties that rule in the europarlament , almost all of them clearly say that they are `` socialist '' . 
  and if not `` socialist '' then `` democratic '' . 
  which is pretty much the same . 
  i do n't want to sound rude , but ... have you got trouble reading ? 
  seriously . 
  `` it appears that it is . 
  you statement eu caused the crisis in ukraine just reeks of satire . '', 
  there was peace in ukraine , ukraine was neither pro-russian nor pro-eu . 
  it was normal . 
  then the eu started sticking it 's nose into it , and boom - euromaidan , invasion of crimea . 
  `` it does n't matter , because there are other states which matter more '' no shit . 
  why does n't it matter ? 
  maybe because it has idiotic laws ? 
  `` untrue '' it 's not just about the gdp . 
  `` what ? 
  i seriously mean , what ? '', 
  that . 
  global warming is n't caused by humans . 
  a few hundred years ago the polish and swedish armies were marching through the baltic sea at winter , because it was freezing . 
  that is a normal cycle , and happens every few hundred years . 
  not caused by humans . 
  `` it hardly employs enough people to run the union efficiently '' try growing some cabbage and selling it on the streets without registering it , you 'll see how efficiently the union works . 
  `` china is a country . 
  is not . 
  eu would be way more important if it were a country . '', 
  it would n't . 
  nothing would change , actually . 
  only that the bandits could pursue new laws faster . 
  `` chinese growth is slowing . 
  it wo n't be 10 % growth '' indeed it is . 
  but does n't mean it wo n't rise again . 
  and , yes , it is very high . 
  china will be the worlds most important country within a few years . 
  `` no they are n't '' `` dutschke also advocated that the transformation of western societies should go hand in hand with third world liberation movements and with democratization in communist countries of central and eastern europe . 
  his socialism had strongly christian roots '' source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudi_dutschke most important party in the european parlament : european people 's party second : progressive alliance of socialists and democrats third : alliance of liberals and democrats for europe forth : the greens -- european free alliance fifth : european conservatives and reformists ( still better than the ones above ) sixth : european united left -- nordic green left seventh and last : europe of freedom and democracy ( the least bad , because they are anti-eu , but sadly also democratic . ),

  `` is this satire ? '', 
  no , it is n't . 
  global warming is n't caused by humans * a few hundred years ago , the polish and swedish armies were marching through the baltic sea which was freezing during winter . 
  `` global warming '' is a normal cycle , and happens every 800 years or so . 
  germany , after world war 2 a country incredibly devastated , had a free market for some time , and has become the strongest country in europe again , with high growth . 
  after creating and expanding the eu - boom germany falling . 
  same happened to poland after starting preparations to join the eu - in the 90 's , with a free market - around 7 % growth . 
  later - 3 % . 
  would be - growth like germany , but we did n't sign the idiotic environment deal . 
  try selling some cabbage on the streets , and look at how quickly some eu politics will put you into prison for not registering it and paying 80 % taxes . 
  for over two thousand years europe was the center of the world , it was the capital of mankind . 
  the world was focused around europe . 
  it was always a country from europe that was the strongest in the world , first it was greece , then rome , then germans , then poles , then propably germans again ... 
  independent countries . 
  today europe does n't matter anymore . 
  people think it does matter because it is in the center of the map . 
  but it does n't . 
  why ? 
  pretty much because of the eu . 
  europe is drowning in immigrants , giving away money to lazy f_cks , germany ( oh , the almighty germany ! ), 
  has a growth rate of -2 % . 
  the eu signs idiotic deals about fighting the global warming ( which does n't even exist ) and slows down whole europe 's growth even more . 
  the eu started as a free-trade union , but today it is a bureaucracy union . 
  china , a country 30 years ago 20 times poorer than europe , introduced a free market , and today laughs at europeans , how stupid they are . 
  china became the world 's second superpower , right behind the us . 
  within a few years , it will be the world 's greatest superpower , with a 10 % growth . 
  this http://www.objectivesubject.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/229645279_fef2d36cac_b.jpg is how the world map really looks like today . 
  europe does n't matter anymore . 
  fact : you remember when a few decades ago , when the warsaw pact still existed , some left wing , communist groups terrorized europe ? 
  the soviets were funding their weapons . 
  they wanted socialism , and then communism . 
  the european society pretty much hated them , and they got almost eradicated . 
  but then , the ones left from these groups ( rudi dutschke for example ) thought `` why attack ? 
  why not just use democracy and become politicians , and gain power this way ? '', 
  and they are the ones rulling in eu today . 
  if you do n't believe me , you can google it . 
  ** sorry for the long post , you propably did n't even read it , but whatever ... ** * edit : aah , and the ukrainian crisis was caused by the eu . 
  * + i ca n't answer all your posts guys , i have a 10 minute cooldown timer because i have a low karma score on this sub . 
  only an . . < badwordhere  could support it . 
  the eu destroyed europe . 
  besides , the treaty of lisbon already made the eu a single country . 
  you are not independent anymore . 
  justice does n't equal everyone earning the same amount of money . 
  justice is not robbing someone elses money just because you do not have enough of it . 
  hhahahhahahh justice in norway ? 
  xdd tell that to breivik was n't hanged for killing 70 people xddd and now is enjoying his holiday in prison xd, 
  yes , i do have a problem !, 
  the problem is the islamization of europe !, 
  lol usually i would laugh at you using the '' ** phobic '' type of word , if you would accuse me of homophobia or other shit , but here , yes - i 'm scared about islamists . 
  and everyone should be . 
  go to somalia and try to pray in a christian way ( even if you 're not chrisitan ) on the streets . 
  you 'll see what happens when they are in the majority . 
  aaaand that 's one of the reasons why germany will be islamic within 40 years :d,
