   well they 've been smacked around throughout history , being saved by others all the time . 
  maybe they should look in the mirror . 
  i do n't remember any instance of poland being saved by someone , except for maybe us economic policy towards the soviet union . 
  i 've heard they were working on some weapons of mass destruction or some stuff like that . 
  better check on it with our freedom !, 
  hahaha , fooled you !, 
  better hide your kids or they 're going to taste the asphalt !!!, 
  sorry , wo n't happen again . 
   jew in any suburb/major city in europe . 
  well , i do n't think anything would happen in poland . 
  you probably mean any city with significant muslim population . 
   `` outsiders '' in any country with a massively homogeneous population . 
  same here . 
  i do n't think anything would happen to a black man in poland ( except for rural areas ) . 
  and we might have the most homogeneous population in europe . 
  10 years ago i 'd probably see no more than 1 person with different than white skin color per week ( and i live in one of the bigger cities ) . 
  now there are people of different ethnicities everywhere and it does n't really bother anyone . 
  of course , i might be wrong and i 'd love to read something from the perspective of a black person living in poland . 
  oh , all right . 
  never seen those outside of the internet . 
  are scooters considered an american `` thing '' ? 
   but the poland gentlefolk attacked the crown caravan and tried as much as possible to delay vytautas ' caronation , which they did , because vytautas died before the crown arrived . 
  we have the same story about polish coronation so i wonder if they are really true . 
  supposedly germans attacked polish caravan that was coming back from vatican ( or whatever was it 's name ) in 1025 . 
  although our guy boleslaw , lived long enough to become a king ( he died few months after a coronation ) . 
  i think that 's partly because no one likes being told that he lives in poland b which is somehow worse than the other parts of the country . 
  yes also duda got : 66 % of the votes from people with primary education 54 % of the votes from people with secondary education 45 % of the votes from people with higher education you see any pattern here ? 
  oh and also duda got 62 % of the votes from people living in the countryside and only 41 % from people living in the big cities . 
  that was n't fearmongering . 
  that 's simple truth . 
  duda is a step backwards . 
  he had a good campaign and young people probably do n't remember the last time pis ruled here , so they should get ready for shit that 's about to come if kaczynski wins in october . 
   roll-back of necessary retirement reforms , i do n't think it 'll happen . 
  he ca n't be that stupid . 
   decrease of taxes while rising the expenditures . 
  this one is just plain populism . 
  taxes will probably rise like always . 
  they probaby wo n't deliver on most of their promises . 
  i imagine next hundred years of polish politics will be just po/pis president changing every 5 years , 
  with komorowski we were slowly moving towards europe . 
  now it 's gon na be 5 years of anti-abortion , anti-invitro , anti-eu , smolensk and pro-church whining . 
  now i 'm scared of the parliamentary elections in october . 
   i do n't get why so many poles on this subreddit seem to ... that 's what they teach us at history lessons . 
  i think that 's what they teach you in your schools as well . 
  `` we 're the best , history has been unfair to us but thanks to our bravery we 're here now '' ... 
  unfortunately they ca n't teach us thinking rationally . 
  it was a calculated decision and a dick move , but our politicians should 've seen that coming ( maybe they did ) . 
  it does n't mean they 're not fucking stupid . 
  mistakes were made during the investigation , it does n't mean there was a bomb on the plane . 
  i agree , but you can do it without naming your kid vanessa . 
  in poland there are : robert , anna , marta , maria , edward , adam , barbara , artur , daniel , julia , filip , klaudia , adrian , oliwia , albert , laura , dawid . 
  i meant the prussian / russian ** border ** of course . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/15x2g1/overlay_of_prussia_on_map_of_polish_parliamentary/ ) . 
   seems like kukiz decision about `` giving '' his votes to one of candidates might make a huge difference . 
  i believe he said that he wo n't be supporting any of the candidates in the 2nd round . 
  he 's really `` anti-system '' . 
  i think komorowski will win it anyway . 
   all european constitutions are word-for-word copied from one another great !, 
  the polish constitution was the first one in europe , so it means everyone copied from us . 
  i 'm not a big rap fan , but these are some i like ( very popular ones ) : [ ostr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnarujlbzwu ) [ pezet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze7h_meqvb8 ) [ fisz emade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5rvuec-5da ) [ ma\u0142pa ] ( https://youtu.be/hchvgi0-ypa?t=36s ) [ wuwunio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id-ww_anln0 ) - this one is hilarious [ donguralesko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5greyvta93a ), 
   the number of people following/caring about the sport , does anyone really care about ski jumping ? 
  most people i know just watch it in the background while eating a dinner . 
  if we 're talking about tv viewers than it 's probably a close call , but volleyball has an obvious advantage . 
  kids can actually play it and watch it live . 
  ( please do n't kill meee ), 
  was it belarusian ? 
  i feel like i understood more than i usually do when i hear ukrainian or russian . 
  good points . 
  i 'm sorry for grammorin , he definitely does n't represent the view of all polish people . 
  most do n't care about bismarck ( and i do n't think anyone who did n't see valkyrie knows about stauffenberg ) . 
  there are some who do , though . 
  i personally blame history lessons in our schools with the usual `` us against them mentality '' . 
  one other thing that it results in is the infamous inferioty complex . 
  polish people wo n't admit it , but we are extremely sensitive when it comes to what foreigners think about us . 
  we reeeaaally care about it . 
  the general view here is if you were n't jewish it was slightly better to live under german rule . 
  gulag was a factory of death ( just a slower one ) as chances of coming back from siberia were small . 
  i personally do n't see much point in deciding which was worse . 
  i think the main problem polish people have with the russian state is lack of any sort of real apology . 
  unfortunatelly it 's not going to get better because the current russian gov. 
  will never accept the history where the war started for you in 1939 and not 1941 as it 's the basis of their imperialistic propaganda . 
  that sucks man : / are there any signs of changes ? 
  are young people supporting them as well ? 
  that is correct . 
  i just think they focus too much on their petty little fights inside the party , hating the opposition and decresing `` the influence of western controlled media/economy on lives of real ( religious ) poles '' that they wo n't do any serious harm to our country . 
  i feel that 's the sensible thing to do . 
  any sanctions would most likely just increase the poll results of the current government . 
  finally they would have a real enemy that they can talk about and promote themselves as saviours of poland . 
  i believe all this rubbish will blow over . 
  conservatives are passing these reforms not because they want to have authoritharian government but because they are really stupid . 
  we 'll have to repair these few years after the next elections but it should be fine ( or maybe i just trust in humanity too much ) . 
  16 % no answer and 7 % other , means that potentailly there is over 20 % of people not buying what putin sells them . 
  still not that much but looks better . 
  netherlands belgium estonia latvia denmark interesting that top 5 are all small countries by the sea . 
  i wonder if there 's any correlation between close proximity to the sea and height . 
   that 's the first amendment in action . 
  the government ca n't abridge freedom of the press , aka ca n't do anything by law to violate that right . 
  it 's the same in poland . 
  the only thing they can control is the public tv ( their ratings dropped drastically because of this control btw ) . 
  it 's one of many channels/new sources .
