  polong ? 
  you guys should start a petition to move great birtain to the baltic sea . 
  it 's a hate free area and your shape will fit right in , 
  it depends how you look at it . 
  if we 're talking about just the iron curtain times , then yep . 
  if we want to take into the account more history than that , there is this thing called [ central europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) . 
  from the perspective of culture/religious history poland being catholic ( as opposed to orthodox ) was different from the east . 
  in general people do n't want to be called eastern , as they hate being in one group with countries like russia/belarus ( which they consider to be backwards ) . 
   they wait making some miserable career earning ~ 1000 euro net in an outsourcing center in warsaw or krakow and then in mid 30s , desperate , if still attractive enough go for some spanish/italian visitor as the `` reproductor '' . 
  i feel like you 're projecting some insecurities man . 
  andorra --  andoorb ( i do n't care it 's not eu ), 
   10 years ago i reckon if they asked people now , ronaldo would give salazar run for his money . 
   i came to gda\u0144sk from lower silesia , and first year or two were a constant cultural shock for me in that regard . 
  if it 's based on a personal experience you should really avoid using phrases like `` decidedly right-leaning '' . 
  gda\u0144sk is po mostly ( less than it used to be ) . 
  it 's not right-wing even if you compare it only with the bigger polish cities . 
  i agree 100 % with the rest of your points , though  the pride of hanseatic roots is a real thing . 
  i 'm appalled by that comment . 
  you ca n't stereotype the whole nation based on your personal experience . 
  i myself am a hard-working dancing pole . 
  do you use this one as a female name too or just male ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with picking a popular name . 
  especially since some of them never go out of top 10 ( i 'm sure jan has been there for centuries ) . 
  i 'd say the only rule you should think about is to not make your kid 's life hard . 
  just be sensible , do n't name him jonasz , do n't name her d\u017cesika ( in poland at least ) . 
  as to family names , i 've always hated having three different aunts with the same name . 
  it 's just confusing , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_last_judgment_ ( memling ) this is only the 1st thing that popped into my mind . 
  stolen from the italians . 
  i 'm sure our museums are full of robbed goods just like in any other country in europe . 
  get your head out of your ass , we 're not the christ of nations . 
  poland did some bad shit too . 
  we 're not a perfect country , that 's always on the right side and others hurt us for no reason . 
  thinking this way does n't make you a patriot , it 's just dumb . 
  the only thing polish people are perfect at is complaining about their ancestors getting hurt 300 years ago , like it fucking matters . 
   tvn ( 24 ) understand before replying . 
  do you know what `` public '' means ? 
  tell me what tusk 's son have done to the polish democracy exactly ? 
  because i know pis is trying to destroy it right now.there 's no comparision between getting a watch and spitting on foundations of our democracy - the constitiutional tribunal . 
  again try to read before you answear . 
  i 've never said po did n't abuse their power . 
  everyone starts doing it after some time . 
  what i mean is they never abused the law ** like ** pis, 
  such a bullshit statement . 
  even if po was more corrupted than pis , i 'd still choose them over people who abuse democracy to that extent . 
  some people repeat it like a fucking mantra , but it 's simply not true . 
  i 'm not saying po was perfect , but poland actually got better under their governing and that 's something a lot of people seem to forget . 
  we changed a lot in the last years . 
  maybe the change is needed once in a while , but kaczynski is a man on a suicide mission . 
  he 's a dictator , out of the loop . 
  he 's clueless about the current world . 
  speaks no foreign languages , uses a sock instead of a bank account . 
  bastard reads his books on political strategies and decides the fate of 37 million people on his own , like it 's a game . 
  po never abused the law like pis . 
  have you seen anyone as crazy as macierewicz at po ? 
  have you seen them make the public tv station into filthy propaganda 24/7 ? 
  have you seen po pay 20 million to the fucking priest bastard rydzyk using old people for their money and votes ? 
  they applied for and used the eu funds whereas pis is not doing anything right now . 
  let 's change the education system . 
  sure like that matters . 
  there 's no comparison between po and pis . 
  sidenote : i did n't vote for po anyways . 
  he was european anyway , we can cut them some slack . 
  i just imagined hitler pointing what he wants from the menu boards with the roman salute . 
  would make a great 5s skit . 
  i 'd say there 's at least one month every year in which you can swim around . 
  then he paid one of the women $ 800 000 just to shut her up . 
  some of them were just attention seekers , but seriously there 's so much shady shit going on with those cases and his behaviour . 
  it 's not exactly easy to prove something against the most powerful man in the world if you 're a nobody . 
  maybe i should n't have assumed guilt , but bill clinton is a pathological liar and a [ war criminal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-shifa_pharmaceutical_factory ) . 
  the man ordered a missille strike with no evidence ( which was later admitted by the us government ) on the same day that monica lewinsky went to the grand jury . 
  he uses bombs to divert the attention away from his personal problems . 
  `` no one left to lie to '' - a sugggested read . 
   thats not what the impeachment was i assumed you 're responding to that comment because you share the sentiment of the guy who wrote `` they do n't make presidents like that anymore . '', 
  excuse me , if you do n't . 
  what i mean is the impeachment is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  [ ahem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bill_clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations ) he sexually harassed women and used his position of power to get away with it . 
  he was n't the worst president sure , but being fucking sentimental about him means you do n't actually know what kind of person he was . 
   but thats not something i measure the potus on . 
  would you measure it based on the number of sexual harassment accusations the potus gets ? 
  because then clinton 's a front runner . 
  i know he has an image of a charming guy , but he 's a liar and a shitty human being in general . 
  bloody immigrants ... 
  \u0141\u00f3d\u017a then . 
  did you get a patriotic boner already ? 
  we 're such a special little snowflake nation , right ? 
  our people born within arbitrarily defined borders are so much better than those pussies born a bit to the west . 
  every single military ranking i 've found online places turkey somwhere around the 10th place in the world . 
  [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_strength_index ), 
   yes , and . . ? 
  what is your point ? 
  ok , i 'll simplify it : me : it makes you feel bad/morally wrong you : it does n't make me morally wrong . 
  on principle i simply do n't think we should ally with dictators . 
  me : your principle is based on what we perceive as moral ( so doing sth opposite to what you perceive as moral obviously makes you feel it 's morally wrong ) you : yes , and ... ? 
  can you see the point ? 
  i was just arguing that it does make you feel morally wrong to be in bed with erdogan and saying `` on principle '' is synonymous with `` morally '' . 
   what exactly can we do to them if they are in the alliance ? 
  talk . 
  it 's for sure easier to discuss things when you did n't kick someone out of the party 5 minutes earlier . 
  the alternative is : we kick them out and then we can strong-arm them into submission with our military force .
