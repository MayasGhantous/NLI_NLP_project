someone ca n't even spell-check the names on wikipedia it seems ... 
  although one could argue this is how they 're pronounced , written in english , i guess . 
  it 's ladybug in english . 
  they 're earn the most ( even though lewiatan has more shops ) and they have surprisingly good quality for their proces ( they 're low cost chain ) . 
  interesting domain name . 
  you could but you need a certificated one otherwise you will be fined , so there 's that . 
  i 've heard there are a one-time use certificated breathalyzers which are very cheap so if you do n't want to get a normal one then there 's this choice . 
  ( but do n't quote me on that , might be just a rumor ), 
  it 's the latter . 
  the police does n't have money to equip every police car with a breathalyzer so politicians ' genius idea is that every car should have one so police can use it on you when they stop you . 
   i would repeat katy\u0144 phrasing !!, 
  hell , it was disturbing for me as a 20-year-old as well . 
  `` hidden german option '' - silesians , with their silly polish-german mix, 
  can confirm , ca n't leave my home for fear of hearing ukrainian . 
  * shudder * they 've come for our safety , next they 'll take our w\u00f3dka !, 
  * hide in closet * ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i do n't know , sorry . 
  i rarely visit polish media sites , but onet is notorious for clickbait and shitty comment section . 
  but using onet 's comments is like using youtube 's ... 
  i 'd say 85 % is trolls , and 50 % is plain stupid . 
  low hanging fruit . 
  i welcome our new kiwi overlords . 
  ca n't be worse than the previous ones ... 
  it was a social movement under a name of trade union . 
  today it also exists but solely as a trade union and it is crap like all others ... 
  unfortunately it only works on islands , froggie , 
  oh god , i 've become what i hate :( that mobile user who did n't change the link, 
  i do n't think that word means what you think it means ... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongoloid, 
  but it is stored in / 2007/06 / and the page in / 2007/06/27 / i guess this site is a little on wrong terms with the whole theory of `` time '' . 
  that explains ** a lot ** . 
  waiting on someone to be butthurt about phrasing in the aushwitz one . 
   ~ ~ ukraine ~ ~ russia what you did there . 
  i see it . 
   biggest party in iceland so a dozen members ? 
  i guess i need to step up my ~ ~ wasting time ~ ~ reddit game . 
  better check your legit privilege before asking ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ cryptic, 
  a strange phenomenon , jpaolo in the wild . 
  after reading the comment i was like `` uhm ... was n't it / r/europe and not [ censored ] ? '', 
  but then i checked the username and it was my ( second ) favourite comic author :d, 
  the japanese voice is really excited about him, 
  the very same . 
  many people find it an eyesore in general , but to me it 's a nice landmark . 
  it probably helps that i 'm not from silesia . 
  [ imho looks much better from the street level ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/katowice_spodek-_nowa_elewacja.jpg ) ( which normally is the perspective you look at it from ), 
  dead kulczyk can not melt steel beams !, 
  well , duh . 
  all previous governments were dragging our economy down so why is only this one getting all the bad rep !?!?!?!? 
  ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ have n't ^ ^ ^ guessed ^ ^ ^ yet ... 
  ikr , best corkscrews around this part of the galaxy !, 
  well it helps that kung fury was a parody ( because if it was n't oh boy would that be bad ) and this is not . 
  i agree that the main character was quite cringey and adolf whateverow was kinda ultimate evil , but it was n't that bad . 
  personally i give the whole thing a solid ok for 11 minutes . 
  edit : a word, 
  obviously they expected special effects of avengers with quality of shawshank redemption but on a budget, 
  but ... okocim is not from krak\u00f3w but rather from brzesko ( and always has been ) . 
  and it exists . 
  well , i 've heard that the reason many lithuanians do n't like poles is due to how the polish minority acts , but damn ... 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  polish and russian minorities together ? 
  wow . 
  meh korwin getting into sejm would be sad , but you can stomach it . 
  now , korwin or zjednoczona lewica winning elections , that rustles my redditor jimmies . 
  edit : unlikely as it is , of course, 
  that was ... unexpected ... 
  do n't you forget to pm op that hobo 's bum . 
  on the countryside volunteer fire departments ( osp ) use sirens everytime they are needed . 
  i mean , i only have positive opinion about our police . 
  i am just saying what i mostly hear from others . 
  nah , most of poles hate our police too . 
  same in many countries . 
  it 's not an america-only thing sadly . 
  the trick is to go fast enough that you get the looney tunes effect long enough and you glide over the holes . 
  source : polish physics, 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af just a stereotype, 
  because it 's not a serious post and it looks funny because it 's the only non-german word there together with the german conqueror stereotype of translating every foreign city . 
  and they do this specifically in czestochowa ? 
  not likely, 
  [ most likely this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_jasna_g%c3%b3ra ), 
  it 's alternate reality , duh . 
  it 's red sea now . 
  we found the cia shill guys, 
  it 's both . 
  slavs are an ethnic group and eastern/central europe is a geopolitical term and thus being slavic does n't necessarily mean being eastern european nor does it exclude being central european . 
  and terrorists . 
  to be fair , we also kinda do . 
  the whole white and red thing is directly taken from the eagle . 
  it 's not a new thing . 
  there 's more people than ever before in general . 
  please , do n't play dumb with me , you do n't call anyone a `` rag '' to prove an argument . 
  it sounds not so bad in english but you would n't call your mother `` szmata '' , so do n't call that random people just because you do n't agree with them . 
  if you think calling people names is a valid argument in a discussion , you need to grow up first . 
  and for the record , being `` leftist '' and `` rightist '' does n't define someone 's views , because real world is n't binary . 
  do you mean kolor ? 
  that 's in percentage points . 
  poland 's gdp rose 50.6 % from 2004 to 2015 . 
  base was lower for top countries than in western countries so they had more room for growth . 
  and in general gdp represents size of economy . 
  a witcher 's job description is monster hunter, 
   i heard polish people go to egypt and claim they lost their driver license .
