still the roman influence is pretty much visible . 
  username checks out . 
  account creation also checks out . 
  as of now kosovo is the only country with 0 votes . 
  surprised to see portugal with so many votes . 
  \\ there you go with an arm . 
  you mean lisbon then ? 
  sunny , cheap pints and cheap housing . 
  i think that 's all lads . 
  worked in a place where i had to deal with lots of tourists . 
  being able to speak english , french and spanish fluently and understanding the basics of italian i learned only to speak english to customers . 
  mostly because 90 % of the tourists i had to deal with , were self-entitled people that thought the world went by around their language . 
  spaniards are the worst . 
  they would claim `` no te entiendo '' nor would they make an effort to understand . 
  yet , they expected me to answer them to questions like `` perdone . 
  in spanish . 
  well if they do n't understand that `` precisa de alguma coisa '' is pretty much the same as `` necesita algo '' i 'm not even trying . 
  having said that whenever they complained in their native tongue that i was being unpleasant then i would end it with a `` je comprende fran\u00e7ais , mais non probl\u00e8me '' and would keep addressing them in english . 
  portugal should pretty much have it 's own flag in our territory . 
  we mock ourselves more than we mock spaniards . 
  the only times we mock spaniards are : a ) americans speaking spanish while in portugal . 
  which turns our facial expression into some kind of disgust and contempt . 
  b ) whenever our national squads play football against each other . 
  thanks . 
  i 'd honestly like to know the sample size of the study . 
   people love taking these examples of highly visible prices , but forget that the basic commodities : supermarket food , rent , utilities , transportation , etc. 
  all remained within the margins of inflation . 
  transportation . 
  carris ( lisbon 's public transportation company ) . 
  prices of 1 ticket were 90 escudos , which is 45 cents nowadays . 
  as of now they are 1.70 $ , which are 340 escudos . 
  that is almost 4 times the price in escudos . 
  transportation - monthly pass ( subway + bus ) - 6.820 escudos ( 12,4 $ ) monthly pass nowadays - 35 $ . 
  almost 3 times the price that was . 
  nowadays 1.599 / l $ ( 1.8 times higher ) . 
  1.279 / l ( 1.9 times higher ) i 'll search for the utilities prices and will answer later . 
  that sample period is terribly short . 
  in portugal 1 $ = 200 $ ( escudos ) . 
  anyway , with portuguese sources : coffee : from 0.40 $ to 0.70 $ . 
  [ coffee raises by 50 % and smoking costs twice as it did ] ( http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/preco-do-cafe-subiu-50-e-fumar-custa-o-dobro_134747.html ) bread & pastries : anything that costed below 100 escudos , was automatically converted to 1 $ ( remember , 1 $ is 200 escudos ) , therefore doubling the price these items . 
  [ source ] ( http://visao.sapo.pt/o-que-duplicou-de-preco-nos-ultimos-10-anos=f640829 ) a pack of marlboro costed 400 escudos = 2 $ . 
  it now costs 4.70 $ . 
  more than doubled . 
  source is the same as above . 
  newspapers more than doubled their prices . 
  of course you could say that inflation caused prices to raise , nonetheless one can also argue that without being in the euro you can more efficiently control your country 's own inflation . 
   it will center on the euro group , in economical terms this might actually make sense , everything else is just burnt to ashes . 
  different countries , address different issues . 
  each country faces several different social problems , therefore applies several different social policies . 
  rinse and repeat for law & order , transports , public services , welfare , taxes , foreign affairs , subsidies , education , health , on and on . 
  should this happen it would n't still mean that it would work economically speaking . 
  fiscal union would mean that any country with a huge load of debt would drag down everybody with it . 
  it would intertwine all eu countries even more . 
   it will mean unprecedented levels of supranational cooperation between those countries , yes it will , by killing the economy of countries like ireland who would have to adhere to the `` against fiscal dumping '' crusade led by france . 
  or by forcing everyone to follow the same measures even if we do n't have the same problems . 
  or creating yet , a bigger immigration movement to welfare states . 
   and it must include early forms of pan-european democracy , perhaps something along the lines of what people from each country would have less of a voice . 
  transferring the powers of a national government to brussels would n't be an early form of pan-european democracy , but more along the lines of an undemocratic europe . 
  even for those who have n't studied economics it 's obvious that greece ca n't pay . 
  and it is logical that the next step should be debt relief . 
  however , how fair is it for countries that have managed their credit successfully to see the greeks have a debt relief ? 
  should greece get a debt relief be it partial or full , how fair would it be for other countries in the ez whose people have made sacrifices and had to endure austerity ? 
  i 'm talking about portugal , spain and italy , whose debt to gdp ratio is : 134 % , 92 % and 114 % respectively . 
  tax evasion on greece is as high as 30bn $ that are uncollected every year . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21565657-greek-tax-dodgers-are-being-outed-national-sport-no-more ) a debt relief would neutralize the situation in short-term but greece would still have to deal with internal corruption , something europe ca n't fix . 
  so all in all , should greece get a debt relief , passos , rajoy and renzi would have a lot of explaining to do before their voters and the population of these countries would be unfairly treated . 
  i 'm not opposing greece 's debt relief , just stating that should they get a debt relief , other countries people would be crying out loud for the same measures . 
   the greek economy is recovering , gdp is growing , and unemployment is declining wrong . 
  the gdp was shrinking by the end of 2014 . 
  i 'm not the op you 're replying and i 'm certain he does n't need a defense lawyer , despite that i 'll address you in the same fashion you 're addressing him . 
   firstly we give way more to the eu than portugal does . 
  yes , your answer is definitely on point regarding what op first posted . 
  it totally has everything to do with what he just said . 
  nevertheless just so you know , portugal contributes more regarding % of gdp than the uk does . 
   secondly , we are n't even part of the monetary union of the eurozone , so why should we collaborate ? 
  you 're not even part of the monetary union , but last time i checked you were still part of the european union . 
  if you want it 's privileges you 'll also have to deal with it 's flaws . 
  and right now if every country in the eu has to help greece , you might as well do it or get up and leave . 
  i 'm ok with number 7, 
  agreed . 
  sweating during the night where every part of the bed is too damn hot is painful . 
  i remember in 2003 during august of sleeping on the floor of the living room , big white squared tiles that were the only thing that were able to stay cool ish . 
   in portugal , an estimated 1,866 to 2,039 people died of heat-related causes . 
  [ 9 ] 1 august 2003 , was the hottest day in centuries , with night temperatures well above 30 \u00b0 c ( 86 \u00b0 f ) . 
  at dawn that same day , a freak storm developed in the southern region of the country . 
  over the next week , a hot , strong sirocco wind contributed to the spread of extensive forest-fires . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] five percent of portugal 's countryside and 10 % of the forests ( 215,000 hectares [ 5 ] or an estimated 2,150 km2 ( 830 sq mi ) ) , were destroyed , and 18 people died in the flames . 
  in amareleja , one of the hottest cities in europe , temperatures reached as high as 48 \u00b0 c ( 118 \u00b0 f ) . 
  we 're above all of you , spaniards , italians , dutchies and frenchies !, 
  take that . 
  i do n't know about porto , but as someone living in lisbon i can tell you that people know the world leaders . 
  they might not know the policies or what 's going on , but you ca n't bad mouth someone without knowing who you 're referring too .

  edit : missed ireland, 
  content on opinion articles by media . 
  financial times ? 
  greece should opt out . 
  nytimes ? 
  what the hell are the greeks doing ? 
  they should stay in europe .
