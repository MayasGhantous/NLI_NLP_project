  and i can tell you this because there was a thread in / r/brasil asking for forgiveness because of what portugal had done to brasil , because the way they are now is our fault , etc etc. 
  it was then [ cross-posted ( see it here ) to ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/4auvt3/desculpa_brasil_os_teus_problemas_s%c3%a3o_culpa_dos/ ) / r/portugal . 
  man if you can read portuguese you should see the backlash . 
  assuming you do n't this are the most upvoted comments :  probably the most imbecile shit i 've read in this website this year . 
   absolutely pathetic  sounds fake . 
  or just plain stupid . 
   someone should be expatriated . 
   you need to be ignorant to write such barbarity . 
  and one of that fits just perfectly in this thread :  i thought it was absolutely depressive . 
  something i always praise when i speak about portuguese people is that we 're a country where people are open to say what they think without falling for the political correctness type of discourse . 
  it does n't make sense to go with the flow of colonization self-punishment in broad xxi century , even more so , before editing it 's text , op was asking for forgiveness in behalf of the entire population . 
  the citizens of today ( portuguese ) have nothing to do with the actual state of affairs in brasil . 
  everyone i know is either on google dns or opendns . 
  all torrent sites are blocked . 
  all betting sites are blocked . 
  our constitution says shit about digital content . 
  even sites that aggregate lists of blocked sites are blocked . 
  even if they 're not hosting illegal contents ... 
  i know that london is way bigger and that the underground line is also way more extensive than the one in lisbon . 
  having said that 5.10 gbp is close to 7 $ . 
  which is 6 times what you pay for a one way ticket in the lisbon underground . 
  and also more than what you pay for a 24h tram/underground ticket in amsterdam . 
  yeah there are some arr\u00e1bida pictures in some desert beaches that are only accessible by going through the vegetation that look a lot like caribbean beaches . 
  white sand , crystal clear water and the entire scenery . 
  weird then . 
  leix\u00f5es is close enough to porto that people would be well educated in terms of having a 2nd language . 
  it really depends on the location . 
  i doubt typical old sailors in leix\u00f5es would grasp any english , but most developed regions ( lisbon , porto and mostly algarve which bases it 's economy on tourism ) will speak fluent english . 
  mostly younger people who are taught english right after kindergarten . 
  isso e lisbon south bay . 
  speaking for lisbon . 
  hotel prices are quite cheap compared to other european capitals ( looking at you london , paris , rome and amsterdam ) . 
  beer & coffee is also cheap as fuck . 
  0,50 $ to 0,80 $ ( restaurants might sell you for a more expensive price ) for a beer ; 0,60 $ for a coffee . 
  food is also cheap as fuck . 
  you can have dinner for 8 $ with a full meal + drinks + coffee . 
  the airport is closer to the city center than any other airports i 've ever been . 
  then public transportation is also cheap . 
  gatwick , stansted or luton you have to take a national coach or easybus . 
  heathrow the underground prices are way higher than what you pay here ( over 5 pounds ) . 
  cdg is also far from the center compared to lisbon . 
  then you have decent weather and everyone 's pretty much relaxed . 
  even in spain ( madrid and barcelona at least ) you pay way more than what you do in lisbon . 
  compared to greece/croatia/etc i ca n't really tell since i 've never been there . 
  but the reason many northerners choose portugal as a vacations site is because the weather is warm , the people are nice ( most of them ) and it 's cheap as fuck ( bearing in mind what they earn ) . 
  same in portugal . 
  in lisbon since autumn started we have n't had almost any rainy days . 
  south of portugal/spain/italy . 
  the only reason why it has n't become more expensive already is because otherwise the living population would n't be able to afford anything . 
  source : live in lisbon . 
  martial status ? 
  mostly judo , with some knowledge of karate . 
  yeah i just noticed it . 
  they still need the 7500 signatures needed to become a recognized party . 
  i get what you 're saying , i 'm just saying we already have one pirate party . 
  even though it does n't hold many members . 
  [ portuguese pirate party ] ( http://www.partidopiratapt.eu/ ), 
  the great and glorious empire of the mighty portuguese republic !, 
  if you 're practical then take this approach , if you 're tired of 40 years of the same kind of people sitting on our parliament you might as well vote for cdu or be to oppose them . 
  they are guaranteed to have seats and your vote has a practical application . 
  this is my point of view of course . 
  but everyone complains that it 's the same shit every 4 years . 
  but when it 's time to decide they all fall in the same `` oh we only have this options '' lame excuse . 
  if no one starts voting for other parties it 's only logical to assume they 'll never elect an mp . 
  too much trouble . 
  might as well have the dead counting as abstention than renewing the papers . 
  the political party was ( when founded ) a social dem party . 
  but in 40 years they 've shifted to the right wing being a lot closer to neo-lib . 
  they voted against gay marriage in 2010 . 
  goes to show how much social democrats they are . 
  if you 're from lisbon you had 16 parties you could vote for . 
  reducing 16 to 4 ( paf , ps , cdu , be ) is grasping at straws . 
  portugal is a lot worse . 
  [ abstention rate ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/abstention+rate+in+the+elections+for+the+presidency+of+the+republic+total++residents+in+portugal+and+residents+abroad-2207 ) last time 52 % of the people did n't even vote . 
  moving my comment from another thread . 
  ** basics 101 ** election method - d'hondt ( 50 % +1 rule ) 22 electoral districts - lisbon owns the most seats ( 47 ) . 
  total number of seats - 230 majority win - at least 116 seats . 
  paf wins by a short number of seats . 
  paf wins with a big distance but no majority . 
  ps wins by a short number of seats . 
  ps wins with with a big distance but no majority . 
  paf has more seats . 
  ps has more votes . 
  legitimacy problem . 
  parties have to wait for emigration votes ( europe electoral district has 2 , outside of europe has another 2 ) . 
  this can happen if both top parties are separated by less than 4 votes . 
  majority !, 
  ( either for paf or ps ) . 
  this means we have a party with over or equal to 116 seats . 
  no way out . 
  there 's no majority party and our president leaves either the current party stay or appoints a transitioning administration . 
  ballot - [ lisbon example ] ( http://ominho.ominho.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boletim-de-voto-eleicoes-legislativas-2015-lisboa-min.jpg ) ** previous information ** i 've added more information regarding the topic in [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ne0hm/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20151004/ ) ** party leaders declarations ** ** catarina martins ** ( leader of bloco de esquerda ) has already voted and stated :  elections day is a very important day . 
  this is day we all have the same power . 
  at our hardest time , what we need is everyone 's strength . 
  ** ant\u00f3nio costa ** ( ps leader ) said :  each vote is important , decisive and each vote can decide our future . 
  he added that he was confident on a win and told everyone to not waste their power of choosing by not voting . 
  ** rui tavares ( livre leader ) ** asked about abstention he said that it was * always worrying * . 
  when asked about the weather ( it 's been a rainy day here in lisbon where rui voted ) , rui said the following :  you should not think about the weather ( we say tempo , which is the same word used for time ) today , but during the next 4 years , thus vote with conscience so we can be well represented in a parliament with new deputies ( he referred to them in both masculine and feminine forms , deputados & deputadas ) . 
  ** pedro passos coelho ( psd leader , current prime minister ) ** passos coelho was calm when he was interviewed . 
  he also approached those who rather not vote :  abstention has unfortunately been bigger than what we all would expect , not only during this elections .
