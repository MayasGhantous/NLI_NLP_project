  this trend has been rising . 
  i hope that today we can oppose it . 
  he also answered a few questions to foreign journalists in english , saying that he hopes that the portuguese choose wisely and hopes that the next 4 years will be better than the previous ones . 
  ** paulo portas ( leader of cds-pp ) **  i have the routine of voting early because i believe i have to set an example . 
  paulo portas went voting at 8h30 . 
   the vote is a very important political right . 
   what portuguese people have achieved or their country was important and today they can choose with a renewed liberty and at peace . 
  we should have a mega-thread . 
  all i see is threads popping up regarding this same content . 
  it appears as a low probably outcome in almost every news site . 
  publico , observador , jn , etc. 
  mostly because while livre will likely agree with ps , cdu wo n't and bloco wo n't give up on social security which is one of the core points of ps for this elections . 
  they classify themselves as a right wing party , but social democrat is a leftist definition . 
  starting with the end of your comment . 
  list of political parties ( links to wikipedia ) . 
  * [ psd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_\\ ( portugal \\ ) ) ( partido social democrata - * social democrat party * ) * [ ps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party_ ( portugal ) ( partido socialista - * socialist party * ) * [ pp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cds_%e2%80%93_people%27s_party ) also known as cds-pp ( cds = centro democr\u00e1tico e social * social democratic center * - pp = * popular party * or the people 's party ) * [ cdu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_unitarian_coalition ) ( coliga\u00e7\u00e3o democr\u00e1tica unit\u00e1ria - * democratic unitarian coalition * ) * [ be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left_bloc ) ( bloco de esquerda - * left block * ) portugal uses the d'hondt method . 
  we are divided in 22 electoral districts : district | seats -- | -- aveiro | 16 beja | 3 braga | 19 bragan\u00e7a | 3 castelo branco | 4 coimbra | 10 \u00c9vora | 3 faro | 8 guarda | 4 leiria | 10 lisboa | 47 portalegre | 2 porto | 39 santar\u00e9m | 10 set\u00fabal | 17 viana do castelo | 6 vila real | 5 viseu | 9 a\u00e7ores | 5 madeira | 6 europe | 2 outside europe | 2 edit : it is possible for one party to have more seats while the other one has more votes . 
  this causes somewhat of a legitimacy problem . 
  kind of like what happened to al gore . 
  he won the popular vote , lost the electorate one . 
  in this case the priority is always in favor of the party who has more seats . 
  edit 2 : link was broken . 
  anyway , left to right : left | center left | center right | right -- | -- | -- | -- cdu & be | ps | psd | pp, 
  ** portugal - elections time - tomorrow ( sunday ) ** lots of opinion articles , lots of polls , lots of debates and above all lots of laughs . 
  currently there are ** 5 parties ** in the parliament . 
  psd ( social dems ) , ps ( socialist party ) , pp ( popular party ) , cdu ( communist party ) and be ( left bloc wing ) . 
  the ** current government ** consists of a coalition between psd and pp . 
  this government has implemented more austerity measures than troika demanded of them , reason why we have articles like [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/portugal-predicted-to-vote-pro-austerity-coalition-back-in ) ( guardian article ) regarding the fact that ** portugal may be the first country to reelect a pro-austerity coalition . 
  ** for more details regarding the elections check [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/oct/02/portugals-election-a-guide-to-the-parties-and-politics ) . 
  also from the guardian a ** guide to the elections and political parties . 
  ** as of now most polls give the coalition a solid advantage against their main opponent party ps . 
  however there 's been a lot of talk about how unreliable polls have been and this matter could have it 's own comment . 
  shortly and to the point , the polls have been fluctuating a lot , with parties winning 2 to 3 points per day . 
  ** portugal 's parliament consists of 230 seats . 
  to govern with majority , a party needs to have 116 ( 50 % +1 rule ) elected deputies ( legislators ) . 
  ** this term that ended was ruled with a majority party formed between psd ( 108 ) and pp ( 24 ) , totaling 132 deputies . 
  the coalition goes by the name of p\u00e0f ( portugal \u00e0 frente , which roughly translates to portugal going forward ) . 
  the following scenarios are the most likely : * paf ( psd+pp ) win without the majority vote . 
  ps wo n't approve the government budget . 
  1 year from now we most likely will have elections again . 
  * paf win with the majority of the vote . 
  we get another 4 years of merry go round . 
  * ps win without the majority vote . 
  paf said they would be willing to negotiate the government budget , however paf differ with ps in terms of taxes with the most famous case being the tsu ( unique social tax ) , which ps wants to lower and paf wo n't allow it . 
  so all in all , the government will also be shaky and we will likely move to elections again unless paf decides to suck it up . 
  * ps win with the majority vote . 
  we get another 4 years of merry go round . 
  this are the 4 most likely scenarios . 
  since 1974 ( a.k.a carnation revolution and when we had a military coup to get a democracy ) we only had 3 parties governing . 
  ps , psd and pp ( which has allied with both ps and psd ) . 
  there has also been a lot of discussion regarding the fact that the government has asked for studies to be made and now they wo n't show the results that do n't favor them ( immigration , gdp , among others ) . 
  * in other news from this last week * benfica won against atl\u00e9tico de madrid and porto won against chelsea , which has left both portistas and benfiquistas with an inflated ego . 
  lots of portuguese words end with \u00e9 . 
  we do n't have \u00e9e though . 
  caf\u00e9 , p\u00e9 , bon\u00e9 , f\u00e9 , mar\u00e9 , chamin\u00e9 , obo\u00e9 , rodap\u00e9 , pontap\u00e9 , jacar\u00e9 , chimpanz\u00e9 , among others . 
  \u00c9 alone in portuguese is the present of the verb to be / \u00eatre . 
  ele \u00e9 = he is = il est, 
  this is beautiful !, 
  just saying that 's what we get from the tv shows/movies . 
  yeah , you work in a big office in down town la , but then you drive through an hour of traffic to get to your big house in the suburbs full of grass , white fence and all that . 
  big house , yard , fence , suburban street with lots of trees , etc is precisely what everyone thinks of when you talk about the us in portugal and several other european countries that i 've been to . 
   so portugal did n't get leeway ? 
  that is literally not the point . 
  i 'll repeat it for you . 
  ** it 's not about portugal ** being given leeway or not . 
   like i said several times , please vote for an anti-eu party and tell us how it goes when you 'll leave . 
  my way or the high way . 
  there 's no middle ground . 
  pointless debate . 
  you 're stubborn to the point you 've had several people explain it to you in different ways , but you 're still beating the same dead horse . 
  it 's not about portugal being given leeway or not , it 's the visible double standards . 
   well the rules do n't apply to you , so why should they apply to us ? 
  remember this : eu gives budget leeway to france ` because it is france ' - juncker, 
  as long as we do n't go back to cet like we did in the 90s i 'm ok with that . 
  principalmente escrito . 
  you 're welcome to pay me a visit . 
  such is life in lisbon as well . 
  agree with glasgow . 
  my girl went to glasgow uni . 
  first time i went to glasgow i reminded myself of how the internet taught me that glasgow was a proper shit hole . 
  guess what ? 
  i thought otherwise . 
  nice scenery , city centre is quite decent , modern art museum was cool , kelvingrove impressed me and last of all so much street art murals that look great on most of the buildings . 
  another plus was a place ( which i ca n't remember ) that had tons of coffee shops with lots of outside seating and a really good vibe . 
  also checked for lisbon . 
  no mentions . 
  take a look at almost any other european country and you 'll find the same thing . 
  the uk struggle with london is real . 
  and it 's probably worse than in portugal / spain bearing in mind westminster 's ability to basically threaten all the other regions in the uk . 
  same for ireland and dublin . 
  same for france with paris . 
  germany and switzerland are probably the two most decentralised countries . 
  hopes of seeing a huge wall separating gibraltar from spain goes out the window :'( edit : the hope remains / s ^ i ^ feelsorryforgibraltar, 
  what i hear from the mail and sun is that leaving the eu will suddenly bring jobs back to everyone else and will solve every possible issue ( mostly immigration issues ) . 
  when that is simply not true . 
  i probably came across as a bit crass but fuck do people who sit on their asses all day getting subsidies ( people from here , who were born here ) believe that those subsidies are fully paid by other brits ? 
  because that 's not what happens . 
  people also forget that the roads that are maintained in fucking scunthorpe also come from immigrants that are being heavily taxed in london . 
  if the uk deported everyone i 'd want to see who would be working on building/construction . 
  when there were no poles to fix pipes or electricity who would do the job ?
