the title mentioned pictures without famous landmarks . 
  those are famous landmarks in my book . 
  but i agree , someone could probably find much better ones . 
  i do n't know if it would be instant , but ... [ this ] ( http://www.minho.com.br/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vermelho3.jpg ) one has almost everything : the traditional costume , the blue tiles , the marble stairs , the religious figures and the overall out-of-date feeling of it . 
  although for it to be perfect it would need some sardines and a tv tuned in a benfica game . 
  edit : i found a better [ one ] ( http://fotos.sapo.pt/quico/pic/0009wywy ) . 
  fado . 
  am i the only one who says espectador with a silent `` c '' ? 
  just asking because you are the second person to tell me that . 
  my mind is blown . 
  yeah , i searched it a [ bit ] ( http://www.ciberduvidas.com/pergunta.php?id=30420 ) more . 
  it 's ones of those cases where you can keep it or drop it , acording to the pronunciation ( i do n't pronounce the `` c '' ) . 
  it makes me unconfortable , however , when i see it written without the `` c '' . 
  [ i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i 'll never get over `` espectador =  espetador '' . 
  i 'd wager that now you 'll appear to be doubly knowledgeable , because you are aware of abacaxi 's ~ ~ obscure ~ ~ brother , anan\u00e1s , 
  that is a wonderful example !, 
  in portugal , we call pineapple `` anan\u00e1s '' , and in brazil they call it `` abacaxi '' . 
  at the end of the day , we 're talking about the same thing ... although i am told that our european accent is a bitch for brazilians to understand . 
  tell me about it . 
  to some people it comes as a real surprise that we do n't speak spanish over here ... 
  yes , the written form has a lot of similarities , but in general a spaniard ca n't understand spoken portuguese to save his life . 
  then , you have to consider all of the variants of portuguese all over the world . 
  recently ( 2009 , i think ) , the lusophone world ( portugal , brazil , angola , mozambique , cabo verde , timor ... ) made a concerted effort to try and make portuguese a more unified language , making it more relevant wordwide . 
  an example of these amendments would be getting rid of the umlaut in brazil , which is n't used in portugal . 
  basically , we 're pretty chill with the variants of our language ( we do n't have that idea of a `` pure '' language ) , but we will go overboard if someone dares to mistaken it for spanish , 
  we portuguese are chronic pessimists . 
  some people believe this is somehow related to the current economic crisis , but they could n't be more wrong . 
  hell , cam\u00f5es lived in the 16th century and already was a certified fatalist !, 
  ours is a very , very old country . 
  every ( sad ) tidbit of history helped to build our current state of mind . 
  the religious fanaticism of the middle ages ( autos-de-f\u00e9 ... ) , the rise and fall of a gigantic empire , the constant ( and not very friendly ) reminder of our bigger nighbour 's presence ( it was basically castille or the sea for us ) , the unhealthy fascination with the sea and with bigger , better things , the obsession with a king who damned us and someday will come to save us all , the mass emigration we suffered ( first to the colonies , recently to europe ) , our lack of relevance in the modern ages , etc , etc. 
  we are a permanently insatisfied group of morons . 
  it 's no wonder the fado ( = `` fate '' ) is such a big thing in the south . 
  also , do n't get me started on overseas territories . 
  * especially * the british overseas territories . 
  that 's the stuff that nightmares are made of . 
  kosovo represents !, 
  disguised as unmik and with an un flag , but still . 
  ... we love you too , [ bulgaria ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/58878685.jpg ) . 
  i seriously expected better from you , denmark . 
  now explain that `` out '' for italy . 
  normally here in portugal is `` city name '' + '' - ense '' or + '' - eta '' , except for : * beja --  pacense * chaves --  flaviense * castelo branco --  albicastrense * coimbra --  conimbricense * guarda --  egitaniense/egitanense/egitano * guimar\u00e3es --  vimaranense * leiria --  colipolense * ponta delgada --  micaelense * tomar --  nabantino * vila vi\u00e7osa --  calipolense mostly due to ancient roman names . 
  the title is a little bit misleading : i was very , * very * confused when i saw that red dot in lisbon . 
  then i [ found out ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/incidentsummary.aspx?gtdid=201111280033 ) that someone threw a molotov cocktail through a window back in 2011 . 
  so yeah . 
  that 's why there 's a red dot in portugal . 
  according to the source [ website ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/results.aspx?chart=weapon&amp;casualties_type=&amp;casualties_max=&amp;country=162 ) this was an incendiary attack on a facility/infrastructure in 24/11/2011 . 
  no casualities . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/incidentsummary.aspx?gtdid=201111280032 ) . 
  a molotov cocktail thrown through a window . 
  i do n't know what i was expecting . 
  i have no idea , i do n't live in spain . 
  but here in portugal , we see everything french as being over the top . 
  back in the xix , xx centuries it was chic for the portuguese high class to live in france for a number of years . 
  when they came back , they always talked about the palaces and the fashion and the opulence of the french higher classes . 
  so it stuck . 
  the other poster already said the first ones , but i can give you the ones in the edit : * \u00c9 para ingl\u00eas ver . 
  * viver \u00e0 grande e \u00e0 francesa .

  * * women and sardines , you want them to be small . 
  * * * past waters do n't power mills . 
  * * * [ something ] is the colour of a donkey on the run .

  ** wwi ** i can give two sources : [ portuguese ministry of foreign affairs ] ( https://idi.mne.pt/pt/relacoes-diplomaticas-de-portugal/459-relacoes-diplomaticas-portugal-reino-unido-notas.html ) and a portuguese [ military site ] ( http://www.areamilitar.net/histbcr.aspx?n=131 ) . 
  they both suggest that britain did n't want portugal to fight in the war , at least in the first stages of the conflit . 
  by our government 's words : `` portugal 's participation in wwi was not an immediate consequence of the anglo-portuguese alliance and did n't occur at the beginning of the conflit , quite the contrary , the london government asked , in august of 1914 , that lisbon declared itself `` non-belligerant and not neutral '' '' . 
  as for reasons : `` in august 26th , 1914 , the lisbon government gauged london yet again about a possible joint military action in africa , and response was that the uk wanted to avoid having portugal involved in the war , as portuguese armed forces should be reserved for internal defense . 
  this was another lost attempt to force english belligerence from the situation in africa . 
  on august 27th the london government ensures the defense of the portuguese possessions in case of german attack . '', 
  so , at the time , portugal had : * a very weak regime after deposing of the royal family in 1910 , that was viewed with some degree of contempt both internally and by other governments * various actions by the armed forces within portugal 's borders , which seriously weakened the armed forces ' operational capacity and destroyed its discipline * the prospect of a military intervention from spain however , the portuguese republicans * wanted * to fight in the war , because they believed that a common cause would give them some legitimacy and woud help hide their sheer incompetence . 
  also , to keep our colonies in africa that were being theatened by * ze * germans . 
  we entered the war when britain activated the treaty of windsor and requested us to arrest all the german and austrian ships in our ports . 
  which we did ; germany sent us an angry letter 2 weeks later declaring war on us . 
  ** wwii ** also from the government : `` during the 1930s , portugal and the united kingdom understood the necessity to ensure the neutrality of the iberian peninsula in case of conflict in europe , something that could prove difficult given the proximity of franco ( * spanish dictator at the time * ) with the axis . 
  after an internal consolidation period that characterized the first half of the 1930s and the worsening of the domestic political situation , the estado novo ( * salazar 's regime * ) defined the bases and strategic objectives of portugal 's external relations , electing the uk and its proximity to the atlantic power ( * read usa * ) as the fundamental instrument both for national independence against the eventual `` spanish danger '' and the maintenance of the colonial empire , to which are added , among others , internal reasons such as the regime 's survival '' . 
  also : `` the signing of a pact of luso-spanish friendship ( called pacto ib\u00e9rico ) , in march 1939 , tied the two countries to a neutrality that would become advantageous for portugal and especially to england , as it contributed to the neutralization of the peninsula during world war ii .
