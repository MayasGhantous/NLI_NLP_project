  this is only the short version of events , of course . 
  people just forget that adding a headless chicken ( like portugal was in the time of wwi ) to the mix could actually worsen britain 's position . 
  and the fact that we are sort of glued to spain made the people that mattered think if it was better to have iberian neutrality or having a full out war between portugal and spain while hitler was rampaging half of europe . 
   what is the first thought that comes to mind ? 
  the patriotism ; the american flag on a pole ; a bald eagle looking on defiantly . 
  then a burger . 
  then manhattan . 
  when my train of thought reaches the big corporations and the politics i instantly try to think of happier things . 
  i kinda liked him in * the apprentice * , he gave off an asshole vibe that was somewhat entertaining and even endearing . 
  not so much now that he is a politician and the stakes are higher . 
  it 's not like he 's actually going to be president , right ? ... 
  right ? 
  all i know about those people is that they make a tribe that is * somehow * famous and have a tv show about nothing of relevance . 
  could n't spot any of them on the street . 
  is a redneck a poor white person ? 
  if so , no , i do n't associate rednecks with america . 
  plenty of them all around the world . 
  i would associate a wealthy and literate person from a minority group ( black , asian ) with america faster . 
  my opinion on the usa is that the country somewhat sold its sould to giant corporations . 
  i 'm not going to be naive and say that that has n't happened here in europe , it happens a lot too , but in america is more ... blatant ? 
  they have a say in politics , foreign policy , media coverage , health care , education , etc. 
  the people are still amazing , tough . 
  yeah . 
  also people forget that the uk was n't that interested in having portugal fighting alongside the allies in both world wars . 
  however , portugal did join wwi in order to keep and to protect its colonies in africa ; we * were * in the world war . 
  wwi . 
  200k soldiers in flanders , france , angola and mozambique . 
  in wwii ... salazar chose not to breat the treaty with england and everyone knew that war in the iberian peninsula would be a major inconvenience , to say the least . 
  so we stuck with being a beehive of espionage and home to half of europe 's royal families . 
  making some business on the side and lending some bases in the azores to the allies . 
  one of salazar 's finest ideas . 
  that man does not make a valid suggestion in more than 20 years . 
  also , til about macaronesia . 
  well , portugal exports 95 % of its shoe production . 
  [ source ] ( http://expresso.sapo.pt/economia/2015-08-31-a-industria-portuguesa-de-calcado-em-10-numeros ) but the only way we can compete with the asian industry is by improving quality : our shoe brands are mainly luxury brands , so they 're are not that well known to the regular people .

  very high end stuff . 
  on the clothing industry , zara 's business model demands updating of collections very often . 
  so , they have a cluster here in spain/portugal/morocco to fulfill that . 
  the `` non-collection items '' are made in bangladesh , china , india ... we also have a huge textile industry in the north of portugal , but i have no idea of what they produce exactly . 
  ... that 's a man from the 12th century . 
  that modern-day sensibility does n't quite apply . 
  we 're talking about thousands of undocumented migrants that refuse to be registered before they reach their destination , in the hopes of getting asylum at their prefered country . 
  hungary does n't like to have hordes of unregisted non-natives wandering across their country . 
  it 's a valid reason to refuse entry , in my opinion . 
  hungary can refuse entrance to whoever they wish at their non-schengen borders . 
  the existance of a border is a requisite to any sovereign state and hungary is not a `` shit country '' for enforcing the law . 
  haha , no . 
  people would be dressed in black in a funeral . 
  in a funeral procession , there is only a casket involved , a simple one with no ornaments ( flowers are added later ) , and obviously without a saint on top of it . 
  this is only a `` andor '' , a mountain of flowers with the saint of choice . 
  ah sorry , i always keep my volume very low so i did n't notice . 
  ~ ~ i will definitely put a warning ! ~ ~ i substituted the video , this one is better on the sound issue . 
  that 's a very average looking male over here . 
  that , or i 'm becoming somewhat desensitized to it . 
  it 's only a catholic procession . 
  it 's quite common in small villages and it 's fun because it livens up those otherwise very quiet places . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxf0opuaw4o ) is another example , in a larger village . 
  i 'm guessing it 's going viral because it looks like his mum made him do it . 
  people usually wear their best clothes while carrying the `` andor '' , not a `` fuck '' tshirt and a bored to tears expression . 
  made by joana de vasconcelos , she 's a plastic artist .

  it does n't make that much sense , i agree . 
  [ viva portugal caralho ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tuuvuxf.png ) have a glorious [ capit\u00e3o falc\u00e3o ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/pnxf4znngb2dctlvda_pyciqo_jrafais1fng-ekwnm.jpg?w=508&amp;s=5ccbeb716d344b13112ee7694356db7c ) too, 
  it depends on who you ask , [ it seems . ], 
  aw shit . 
  it 's hard to find nice stuff about the azores ( or portugal in general ) in english . 
  but alas , i found these links : [ general stuff ] ( http://www.azoresweb.com/history_azores.html ) [ history ] ( http://www.azoresweb.com/history_azores_2.html ) [ azores in wwii ] ( http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/covering-the-azores-gap-in-world-war-ii/ ) [ more insight on azores in wwii ] ( http://www.skydozer.com/azores-crossroads.html ) -- 5 parts [ travelling ] ( http://gearpatrol.com/2015/01/09/travel-guide-the-azores/ ), 
  i was genuinely curious because for me 18/25 of these are palaces , not really castles in the medieval sense of the word . 
  for me , a castle is something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/castelo_de_guimaraes.jpg ) . 
  then i read about all of the destruction of castles during the 30 years war and it all made sense ... they are castles , but they were rebuilt several times through the ages . 
  awesome heritage you guys have , though . 
  i must visit poland sometime . 
  it 's kind of awesome being an irrelevant country . 
  here in portugal we got all of the perks of being a developed country ( democracy , good quality of life , safety ) , without any of the issues `` relevant '' countries have . 
  you know what issues i 'm talking about ... for instance , to this day i 'm convinced that our country is automatically erased from refugees ' maps . 
  i mean ... we sent delegates to damned greece with the sole mission of * convincing * refugees to come to us . 
  ukranians are n't so picky , i wonder why . 
   together it could make a pretty functional state with a lot more potential ummm no . 
  our country is almost 900 years old and fought spain ( or castile ) for the majority of that time period ; the integration needed to make us one with spain would make catalonia 's antics look like child 's play . 
  also , what potential ? 
  those regions are surviving on money from madrid , we do n't want to be fed bread crumbs from them . 
  edit : i was watching the news the other day . 
  do you know that there is a big controversy right now because we adapted tiny tiny things in our ortography to make it look more like the portuguese that brazilians use ? 
  like getting rid of the mute consonants ? 
  there is a shitstorm going on right now only because of that ; tell the average portuguese that we 're joining spain and it * wo n't * be nice . 
  our president went on an official trip to mozambique . 
  [ fun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimf309bt-8 ) was had by all . 
  i feel stupider after reading that . 
  i take some consolation in knowing that there are ignorant people everywhere . 
  putin is an imperialist motherfucker and russia itself has abused states like ukraine for decades . 
  i 'm happy that you joined nato and have now the opportunity to grow and to become a great country with some sense of security . 
  i took great pleasure in trying to identify all of those characters and i have to say , i believe i 've failed greatly in the balkan bloc , as is tradition . 
  i also believe that we are the only ones other than switzerland without guaranteed points , mainly because spain is a poop . 
  true that . 
  i was struggling between motherland ( too russian ) and fatherland ( too hitler-ish , like you said ) and the closer one to our meaning did n't even come to mind . 
  i did n't see the questions . 
   so i 'm curious , did your country have any dictators ? 
  yes . 
   who were they , how did they come into power , who/what replaced them and what were the circumstances of them leaving ?
