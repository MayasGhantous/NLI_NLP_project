  he was invited to be the minister of finance , because he was a renowed academic . 
  he later became prime-minister , due to his success . 
  salazar ( allegedly ) fell from a chair at an old age and had a cerebral hemorrhage ; he died in 1970 . 
  he was replaced with marcelo caetano , who did n't have an ounce of charisma and could n't buffer the winds of revolution . 
  no one even remembers marcelo because he had the presence of a dead snail . 
   what kind of restrictions did they impose ? 
  censorship in the media and no political opposition allowed . 
  pide ( secret service ) was ruthless and had ears everywhere . 
  salazar despised globalization so portugal became very isolated and very behind in terms of technology in the industry and such . 
  the estado novo regime had an iron fist on the economy and encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates . 
  a big part of the portuguese economy was placed in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates . 
  due to this , portugal and the overseas territories were displaying impressive economic growth in the first years of the regime . 
   were there any particular infamous things they were responsible for ? 
  1 ) the murder of a high profile political figure ( general humberto delgado ) , who was gaining a lot of traction before one of those rigged elections , where he was running for prime-minister . 
  pide usually did n't murder people , they sent dissidents to tarrafal , where they were tortured . 
  also , the general public was n't exactly aware of the extension of the detention measures . 
  however , they made a big deal out of this particular election and then , because delgado had a fair amount of support , they killed him at the spanish border and said the spanish did it . 
  2 ) the colonial wars . 
  people did n't understand why they were sending portuguese people to kill other portuguese people in africa . 
  or why africa was so important that justified sending our young boys and husbands and fathers there . 
   did they have any particular oddball ideologies ? 
  well , he was n't exactly a full-out basket case . 
  the only one that stands out is the necessity to defend the religious and rural values of the country , which he perceived as being threatened . 
  he valued the idilic rural life without taking into account that a greal portion of the population was being underfed and had no access to education other than the basics of the basics . 
   how are they seen in retrospect by the population ? 
  favourably . 
  he kept portugal out of the clusterfuck that was wwii and truly valued our past deeds and history . 
  everyone knows he loved his country better than anyone else ; he truly believed that there was no higher honour than being portuguese . 
  he was even voted number 1 in a * great portuguese people * vote some years ago . 
  his problem is that he lived in the past and was deeply averse to progress . 
  the main criticism of salazar is the fact that he kept portugal , its technology and its economy sector very , very underdeveloped . 
  everything was made in the tradicional way and while it was n't that evident when half of the world was in a war , when europe started rebuilding we suddenly became dead last because we were sooo isolated and so out of the real world . 
  internet arguments are ~ ~ often ~ ~ always stupid . 
  we actually feel for the baltic states ( and others like poor georgia ) because for centuries our independance was at risk courtesy of our very own little russia , that * lovely * and * charming * spain . 
  you are not a `` buffer state '' , no more than we are a `` shit rectangle '' . 
  also , no problem , mate . 
  `` portugalia '' is probably how you say `` portugal '' there in eesti , no ? 
  ( copying my other answer ) i looked at the data , we rate the baltic states roughly at the same level of croatia , slovakia and slovenia . 
  we do n't have any historic ties with any of those countries and honestly we very rarely think about any of them . 
  no disrespect , really . 
  it 's a matter of distance and those countries not being in the public eye/news that much , i believe . 
  lol , i really do n't think so .

  also , portugalia ... the hell , man ? 
  about portugal 's estado novo , led by ant\u00f3nio salazar . 
  its main motto was '' [ deus , p\u00e1tria e fam\u00edlia ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yu5govo.jpg ) '' , which means `` god , ~ ~ fatherland ~ ~ homeland and family '' . 
  it defended portugal as a ** catholic country ** , heavily focused on the ** traditional values of family ** and the idea of portugal as a ** pluricontinental nation ** . 
  territories like angola , mozambique , cape verde , east timor , guin\u00e9-bissau , sao tom\u00e9 and macau were seen as an extension of said ~ ~ fatherland ~ ~ homeland , portugal itself . 
  the integration of all these different cultures as being portuguese was heavily encouraged as seen [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/aar1xva.jpg ) - that means `` a lot of races , all of them portuguese . '', 
  salazar ascended to power as a minister of finance , and was successful , to a degree , in restoring the country 's poor finantial health . 
  later on , as the country 's ruler , he was successful in ** keeping portugal out of wwii ** . 
  as per wikipedia : `` the estado novo was an authoritarian regime with an integralist orientation , which differed greatly from other fascist regimes by its ** lack of expansionism ** , ** lack of a fanatical leader ** , ** lack of dogmatic party structure ** , and ** more moderate use of state force ** . '', 
  salazar was n't exactly like other dictators . 
  he kept his image as an academic , a stern grandfather , if you will . 
  salazar was a catholic traditionalist who believed in the necessity of control over the forces of economic modernisation in order to ** defend the religious and rural values of the country , which he perceived as being threatened ** . 
  one of the pillars of the regime was the pide , the ** secret police ** . 
  they kept the political dissidents in a ** penal colony ** , tarrafal , in an island in cape verde . 
  the portuguese communist party was intensely persecuted . 
  so were anarchists , liberals , republicans , and anyone opposed to the regime . 
  ** censorship was in full force . 
  elections were rigged . 
  ** the whole education system was focused toward the ** exaltation of the portuguese nation and its five-century old overseas territories ( the ultramar ) ** . 
  after 1945 , the main raison d'\u00eatre of the regime became resistance to the wave of decolonization which swept europe after the end of world war ii , which led to the ** colonial wars ** . 
  the regime fell in 1974 , with the ** carnation revolution ** , which was a peaceful revolution . 
  salazar had died 4 years prior to that . 
  the retreat from the colonies and the acceptance of its independence terms in 1975 prompted a ** mass exodus ** of portuguese citizens from portugal 's african territories ( mostly from portuguese angola and mozambique ) , ** creating over a million destitute portuguese refugees -- the retornados ** . 
  most of them were forced to return to portugal . 
  by 1975 , all the portuguese african territories were independent and portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years . 
  the portuguese empire all but collapsed ; it officially ended in 1999 , with the return of macau to china . 
  tl ; dr. no fanatical leader ( salazar was a college teacher ) , no expansionism , retention of overseas possessions was a matter of national interest , somewhat moderate use of force when compared to other dictators , emphasis in a catholic country , emphasis in traditional values and in the rural way of life , extremely averse to globalism ( we made our own shitty coca-cola ) , kept us out of wwii , secret police , rigged elections , censorship , our own azkaban to political dissidents , and a [ peaceful revolution ] ( https://aeesv.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/maia.jpg?w=510 ) to end it all . 
  ... and this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  you shall come back on a foggy morning to save the nation from the usurpers . 
  from the tourists too , if you do n't mind . 
  how could anyone forget [ capit\u00e3o falc\u00e3o ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfbedw-wwmg ) ? 
  hunter of communists and faithful to the mighty salazar . 
  no problem . 
  i appreciate your interest in our literature . 
  the word '' \u00edncola '' just means `` inhabitant '' . 
  he is talking about [ mythology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusus#mythology ) here , apparently luso and/or lisa were sons of bacchus and lusit\u00e2nia 's first inhabitants . 
  according to the lore . 
  this is clickbait at its finest . 
  the man has a weird way of expressing himself , sure , but at no point does he actually say `` terror attack '' . 
  the article should be focusing on his inability to form a straightfoward sentence , not producing quotes out of thin air . 
   political freedoms are not dependent on economy . 
  i never claimed that . 
  i claimed that we have big issues on the economic front , not so much on anything else . 
  like a commentary on how we are usually on the bad side of these graphs , because they tend to be economically related . 
  maybe i was n't clear enough . 
  that portugal breaking the top 10 . 
  not really that surprinsing since our ( gigantic ) problems come essentially from the miserable state of our economy . 
  i think that with [ this other work ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jzxlc1l.jpg ) , we have just enought material to start r/mapswithoutportugal, 
  careful with the generalization there . 
  i 'm sure you would find similar examples in your own country if you tried hard enough . 
  that ship was actually built in 1937 by the nazis . 
  the us seized it and sold it to brazil , who sold it to us in the 60 's . 
  not old enough for the slave trade . 
  you are not that far off , since the [ order of christ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_order_of_christ ) is the successor of the knights templar in portugal .
