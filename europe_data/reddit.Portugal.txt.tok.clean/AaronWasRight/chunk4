  nowadays , we use that symbol in a variety of things , from the air force to the national football team . 
  [ the portuguese empire is coming for you !, 
  ] ( http://www.ruralea.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10991679_787908147923087_8295131774861860430_o.jpg ), 
  the existence of a physical school . 
  there are no mentions of it in any documentation of that time . 
   a nautical school was built there it was n't , that 's just a myth . 
  school in this context means a group of followers . 
  source ? 
  who exactly said that ? 
  the event that cost 50m is exactly the outlier in recent years , it was the one in azerbaijan where they had to build a brand new arena to host . 
  we already have a functional arena , there 's no need to spend that much . 
  [ my source . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/13/how-much-does-it-cost-eurovision-song-contest-and-is-it-worth-it/ ) [ also this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nolkueteg6e#t=2m06s ) . 
  i do n't think anyone will feel the need to restore an old shipyard like the folks in copenhagen did . 
  sure , that 's why these ( also thinking about the french one ) laws ban clothes that obstruct the face , not specifically the veil . 
  it 's meaningless in the great scale of things but it does have a legal basis masquerading the true intent . 
  it 's not like absolute freedom is a thing . 
  not that i know of . 
  the [ potential is there ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/04/06/swedish-football-ultras-wear-niqabs-get-around-law-banning-face/ ) though , we only need criminals to get a bit more creative . 
  i was talking about specific situations like cctv footage of crimes ; anyone can pose as a devout muslim woman to conceal their identity . 
  it 's a basic society rule to always show your face , you also ca n't enter a bank wearing a helmet or a mask . 
  i do n't care if they 're using the full-face veil out of their own accord or being forced to do it , that 's not the issue . 
  the issue is that when someone covers their face entirely , it poses a security threat because they ca n't be identified . 
  this policy will likely affect less than 200 women in the country , therefore it 's meaningless and a show of force to appease the anti-immigration folks . 
  i unfortunatelly ca n't read german , but the [ wassersleben bridge ] ( http://i2.wp.com/thebridgehunter.areavoices.com/files/2013/11/bridge-of-friendship-fl2.jpg ) looks many times longer than the portugal/spain one . 
  it 's [ 3,2 meters ] ( http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-worlds-shortest-international-bridge ) long . 
  if you 're talking about [ this one ] ( http://app.visitluxembourg.com/images/8441-resize-669x445x70.jpg ) , it looks about 3 times longer . 
  do you remember the [ new 7 wonders of the world ] ( https://world.new7wonders.com/lisbon-on-07-07-2007/ ) in 2007 ? 
  also in portugal , also a success . 
  it was a joke . 
  like we have any kind of money , power or influence to do that . 
  then we 're both king and queen , hermano !, 
  haha , probably . 
  i understand it though , he was going rogue . 
   portugal  politically biased choose one . 
  because then it would be an eastern europe ciclejerk . 
  just wait for the yodel-rap . 
  it 's one of the last ones . 
  i ca n't agree with you on that . 
  its credibility hit rock bottom around 2007/2008 , before they introduced the professional jury vote ( worth 50 % of the votes ) , and yes , back then it was basically a eastern europe ciclejerk . 
  now , the jury vote helps to balance the cocksucking a bit . 
  they can , only non-participants in this edition like russia and slovakia ca n't . 
  [ molitva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsueqn1qvv4 ) , the last non-english winner . 
   to win singing entirely non-english was israel in 1998 was n't it serbia in 2007 instead ? 
  one of my favorites ever , btw . 
  no way man , europe has a weird relationship with you guys and your song was n't `` viewer-tested '' yet . 
  so you can slip a little into the bottom half , but not all the way to the bottom , no . 
  the uk is actually expected to do well this year , you 'll probably place somewhere between 5-10 . 
  do n't worry , you 'll get some nice points from us , as tradition !, 
  the thing with spain is that , while their song is goddamn awful , they can always expect points from us ... at least 7/8 , so they wo n't place last . 
  probably germany again . 
  * i had that shit in my head for weeks after that . 
  such an epic trolling . 
  haha no , i think it was something like 14 deg . 
  but the wind has been very strong these past few days , so it has been unpleasant . 
  now minus temperatures ? 
  it snowed here once , i say it was snow but it was more of a mushy hail . 
  did n't matter , had snow . 
  it may seem obvious to you and i , but never underestimate the power of stupid . 
  or willingly ignorant . 
  we need a satire tag on this shit , we do n't need misinformation coming from either side of the aisle . 
  from the highest in the 60 's to the lowest right now . 
  we 've suffered two gigantic waves of emigration in this period to go with the usual stuff ( better education and higher living standards ) so our only hope for generational renewal lies on the return of our emmigrants . 
  that is * very * unlikely to happen . 
   ` typical for women is that over here in their own community the social control is strong . 
  they think that in turkey they 'll feel more free and have an easier time finding a partner that is one the same wavelength . ', 
  i find this situation very interesting . 
  do turks in europe feel the need to be much more traditional/conservative than they would be in turkey to somewhat counter the perceived degradation of the west ? 
  it 's difficult for me to imagine turkey under erdogan to appear that liberating to women , but the idealization they make of their country of origin might be the key here . 
  do n't you get tired of being offended all the time ? 
  is it a competition to see who can throw the most buzzwords around ? 
  the guy is defending babies ffs . 
  that looks seriously amazing ... and slightly insane to get to that level of detail . 
  loving the tiny tram . 
  can i interest you in portugal ? 
  * [ porto ] ( http://www.movenoticias.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/intercontinental-porto-4164645857-2x1.jpeg ) - [ or this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/29/94/42/299442c0c57556b35c08b3cf651b3c81.jpg ) * [ lisbon ] ( http://gqportugal.pt/wp-content/uploads/istock_80231409_medium-1280x640.jpg ) - some nice [ monuments ] ( https://www.flytap.com/-/media/flytap/homepage/big-banner/destinations/portugal/bb-lisboa-d.jpg?h=1036&amp;w=1920&amp;la=pt-br&amp;hash=48c5d383da7d9f09efd1cfdaa206c8c7a583f026 ) there * [ coimbra ] ( http://www.comunidadeculturaearte.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/coimbra.jpg ) - also [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sb_-y7rkmck/tvvivdl7hni/aaaaaaaaaoo/sa31zqohcee/s1600/coimbra.jpg ) i do n't even know what to say about sintra , that place is magical . 
  also braga , \u00d3bidos , \u00c9vora , funchal ( but this one is in madeira ) . 
  tiny country and easy to move around . 
  well , it 's the [ alentejo ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pilxllkf-uc/uhyg8jqijpi/aaaaaaaadsm/fxzhamzr0zm/s1600/alentejo_4.jpg ) , that area looks like a [ desert ] ( https://bemsortido.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_3697.jpg ) in the summer so being a full 2-3 deg above the algarve is not uncommon . 
  meanwhile , it 's kinda chilly here in porto . 
  they say it will reach 24 deg today , we 'll see about that . 
  meh , just banter really . 
  obligatory ** #betterthanspain ** . 
  i 'm surprised that the traditional eastern/western division does n't seem to apply here . 
  particularly sweden/finland and romania/bulgaria/greece look switched to what i would expect . 
  cultural differences at play in employment ? 
  legislation ? 
  what gives ? 
  i honestly think the same . 
  i understand that he is just catering to his audience , but after some time into the video it becomes annoying to watch . 
  to me , at least . 
  why focusing so much on le pen ? 
  why not spend the same amount of time on the current top 4 ? 
  and why the constant contrived laugh ? 
  i used to not mind his videos , i mean , to me he was just a comedian shedding some light on important issues that otherwise would not come to the general american public 's attention , but that tragedy of a [ commentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvyhb3wf4 ) on the refugee crisis made me really wary of his show . 
  so i heard . 
  we only get the really vicious banter from the spaniards and maybe the frenchies/brits this side of the continent , so a well placed jab from someone else is surprising . 
  that 's why the harmless . 
  to us specifically . 
  and only at the dissing game .
