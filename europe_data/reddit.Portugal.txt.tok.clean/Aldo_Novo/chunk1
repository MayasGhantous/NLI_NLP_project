if knowledge does n't not fail me , `` travesseiro '' and `` almofada '' can be used interchangeably, 
  i suspected as soon as i heard him pronounce `` caneta '' . 
  `` caaaaneta '' is not the way to go . 
  `` c ^ a neta '' is, 
  no scotsman in an hungarian joke ? 
  guess they really blend in or they they do n't come around here much . 
  they are much more than i had thought, 
  never thought a portuguese would go to moldavia or a moldavian to portugal . 
  quite rare , indeed . 
  and spotting one on reddit , i am amazed, 
  wait !, 
  is there such thing as a luso-moldovan ? 
  uau, 
  and we would build an awesome relationship a new country that was part of our biggest buyer . 
  spain . 
  besides , portugal and spain are both eu countries , so i do not think an embargo is going to start due to different foreign policies . 
  like if the trade between spain and the uk changed because of gibraltar . 
  i hope it too . 
  if i were the portuguese pm , i would support it in the un . 
  catalans have their own language , traditions and were historically repressed by the castillans , which makes them more rightful to be a country than other european countries ( like belgium ) . 
  i see by the comments in this thread that if the users of r/europe could decide it , portugal would still be a part of spain . 
  why ? 
  you are right , but i think he was being sarcastic, 
  even the portuguese are fleeing portugal , no wonder they do n't want to come here, 
  this and the wars against the spanish and the moors . 
  op got tired and did not finish coloring greece and croatia . 
  +1 because those islands are sobs at map making, 
  the city around the bay is an awesome view . 
  and generally we support the team that has portuguese players/staff . 
  i do n't want to set back your relevance , but portuguese league has been in the last years the uefa 's 5th ranked , not another snail eating romance speaking spain neighboring country . 
  and we were n't mentioned too . 
  so as a portuguese , welcome to our everyday . 
  worked out for austro-hungarian empire, 
  * modern day palaces, 
  and what 's the excuse for portugal ? 
  are we morocco now ? 
  we do are similar to castillians . 
  and a great part of being portuguese is about not being castillians . 
  not very shamed to say we 're also a short people . 
  most of our grandfathers are 1.65 m tall , grandmothers are 1.50 m and our dads are 1.70 . 
  found the mod of the danish r / ` murica, 
  to me it sounds lispy because of the ceceo . 
  in portuguese ( unless you are a brazillian ) there 's the tendency to make `` s/z / \u00e7 '' sound `` ch '' while castillian strongly makes it `` ssss '' , with the tongue always latched on the upper front teeth . 
  could sound much closer to portuguese ( especially the northerner accent ) , if they did not had that habit, 
  you described my thoughts about french exactly . 
  they 're like `` tonton de donton \u00ea tondon de dondon '' . 
  and the fact they do n't pronounce their word til the end does n't help it, 
  ** italian ** : like they 're singing . 
  most pleasant of them all . 
  ** castillan ** : like they have a lisp on the tongue , and reminds me of the speech impediment some kids here have called `` sopinhas de massa '' . 
  sometimes annoying , sometimes funny . 
  ** french ** : singing , but more like german . 
  and they always the same metric in their sentences . 
  mildly pleasant to hear . 
  ** germanic languages ** ( besides english ) : they sound like someone is gathering spit from the back of the throat . 
  also , the combination of the consonants is very different from portuguese , so it sounded for some time like you guys had less vowels than us . 
  dutch to me sounds like a slower german and their cadence is arrhythmical . 
  always expect them to speak them in a pattern different than they use to.can ' t distinguish individual scandinavian languages , they all sound like even more incomprehensible german , although they loose some of the impression of taking out a spit and sound a deeper tone . 
  dutch - annoying . 
  german - not like it . 
  scandinavian - bearable to hear . 
  ** english ** - very nasalized mixture of german with french words . 
  bearable to ear . 
  ** finish ** - slow hungarian , not a great comparrison , but the best i 've got . 
  do n't get any of the words , like the magyar tongue , but feel like they over-extend the duration of the vowels - something like `` aaa '' ... mildly annoying . 
  ** romanian ** - surprisingly similar to italian , but not with the same rhythm . 
  mildly pleasant . 
  ** slavic languages ** - lots of `` spra '' and `` ienka '' sounds . 
  seems like the end of every sentence is a tone higher than the beginning . 
  ca n't distinguish them , but had n't much contact too . 
  funny to hear . 
  ** hungarian ** - like no other language i heard before . 
  loved this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgt-rtdkmcm ) . 
  like it . 
  ** greek ** - pattern close to portuguese or castillan , but the way they speak words ( always finishing with vowel-s sounds ) gives the idea they half whistle while speaking ( but different from that pedo of family guy , a much lighter version of that ) . 
  had a good teacher that also done that , so i like it . 
  ** turk ** - sometimes it seems not every turkish speaks the same language . 
  the impression that i 've got the pronounciation and rhythm of speech varies greatly from person to person . 
  not enough data to form opinion . 
  ** galician ** - basically portuguese with castillan pronounce . 
  that 's what stood on my mind after watching tv galicia . 
  maybe not same language as mine ( maybe yes ) , but the closest thing i will find in europe ( and ahead of some brazilians with weird accents ) . 
  10/10 would use galaico-portuguese again . 
  ** catalan ** - very close to portuguese , but with the habit of not terminating the words with vowels . 
  sometimes hits the uncanny valley due to looking very close ( but not close enough ) . 
  when it does n't , it 's good to hear it . 
  ** estonian ** , ** lithuanian ** , ** latvian ** and ** albanian ** - error 404 , could not find . 
  ca n't say about those . 
  edit : corrected format mistake, 
  got to thank franco . 
   why would you say the period when the royal family was in brazil embarrassing ? 
  because of the english controlling the metr\u00f3pole ( it was said that the ambassador in london had more power in iberian portugal than the portuguese king ) . 
  you might be right saying those episodes were too much unbalanced to be embarassing . 
  the numbers were n't even in the same order of magnitude, 
  bringing democracy is worthy of celebrating . 
  however :  at the hands of incredibly incompetent and corrupt governments . 
  and done by incredibly incompetent and corrupt governments to its own people . 
  worth adding for sizing the disaster that turned out to be . 
  someone mentioned the battle of alc\u00e1cer-quibir . 
  i would add the reign of d.jo\u00e3o v , the period when the royal family was in brazil after napoleon being defeated , the british ultimatum and the loss of the indian territories .
