  and it opened the precedent for macau :(, 
  if you guys regret it gib oliven\u00e7a back, 
  that 's [ our moment ] ( http://www.asbeiras.pt/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/eusebio-chorar-mundial-66.jpg ) . 
  pick another, 
  i request , please , if you do n't mind, 
  if you use the aks adequately before the election , they wo n't, 
  the negatives is that they have only aks to sell . 
  we do that click with the tongue on the top of the mouth when we complain , but it is not very frequent indeed . 
  it 's much easier to shove the arm foward and say `` se foda essa merda '', 
  he will be welcome to portugal ^ we ^ will ^ anything ^ to ^ differentiate ^ us ^ from ^ them, 
  yesterday ate feijoada , went to the beach that same afternoon, 
  every august our proud soldiers come from the battlefield murdering the french . 
  at the same time they murder the portuguese, 
  i do n't know how much you guys go to the local universities on the uk , but the most reputable universities are of lisbon , coimbra and oporto ( the order of reputation varies according with the degree you choose ) . 
  then you have those of braga , aveiro and covilh\u00e3 , which usually are not the first choice but not a bad one . 
  people often choose courses from those universities ( we get to candidate to 6 different courses ) as a priority . 
  as a caution measure or due to low grades , you choose other universities ( aka the local one , if you have it ) so , unless you live in lisbon , oporto or coimbra , it 's very rare to show preference to the local university . 
  if you live in any other city , and you hang around the bus/train station , you will see every friday evening students arrive and on sunday afternoon leaving with bags and tupperwares with mom 's food tl ; dr : no , it 's not very frequent , but some people do it, 
  still do n't know where . 
  data is still being processed worst case scenario may just enter on january or not go at all, 
  true that . 
  we like people coming to our country ( please do that - bring cash and spend it here ) , the problem is when it affects negatively the lives of the residents, 
  restricted to gypsies here if i had n't a gypsy friend would never know about it, 
  that 's a gypsy curse this side of the raia cago nos t\u00eas defuntos, 
  got it too , only more offensive : '' - vai para a puta que te pariu ! '', 
  '' - go to the whore that birthed you ! '', 
  are they counting on immigration ? 
  because if politics continue as they are now , you have to count immigration, 
  that seems to be the impression on portugal too every 17yo wants to go on carnival vacation to lloret del mare to get drunk away from their parents sight , which makes it sound trashy even to people that did not went there . 
  ps : noticed your first post was getting downvoted , upvoted you because you were expressing your opinion ( and to annoy the spanyards ), 
  that might be the general impression , but spain has a culture as relevant as france or italy ( and i might be banned from some portuguese subreddits for saying that , so consider i 'm being serious ), 
  this is one of the rare moments that i 'm proud the portuguese were mistaken for spanish, 
  we portuguese are also talking about if there are too much tourists in lisbon . 
  take a look at this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/3gzdfe/lisboa_em_agosto/ ) on r/portugal ( ok , maybe just look at the image ) overturism is annoying some of us, 
  so ksa and qatar basically act like jehovah 's witnesses but instead of boring people to death , they bomb them i blame the geologist lobby by putting oil on the middle east, 
  an old school trick to speak in code, 
  thank you . 
  for what i 've read on other comments , those numbers per capita are impressive bosniaks turning islamic terrorists is a new thing or is has happened in the time of jugoslavia ? 
  brazilians . 
  immigrated in the last decade and assimilated quite easily . 
  then people from the palops , of which angolans and cape-verdians are the most common . 
  came here since the 70s because of scolarships and better economy . 
  as native minorities , gipsies . 
  why ? 
  because they were tired of spain, 
  hmm , interesting , tell me about other minorities, 
  what about almude , alqueire , quartilho or l\u00e9gua ? 
  thank you . 
  amazing that we have a similar food but we are n't close to each other, 
  what is the literal translation of guly\u00e1s in english ? 
  cause the portuguese version translates to `` female gardener '', 
  could someone provide the translation in english ? 
  that 's the meaning of the word now ... suggested it like the french rescued `` gaulois '' to mean a frenchman of complete european ancestry maybe you guys sort some other word to mean it . 
  after all , it only depends of the people living there . 
  10 years have passed and [ this guy ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/467375837717995520/ejrpabuj.jpeg ) still refuses to mention greece because of it, 
  it 's true . 
  you just described around 20 % of our population ( just wanted to debunk the myth of all southern europeans being black haired and tanned ) and if you 're a guy , with grey eyes , i will assume you became popular with the local ladies, 
  we 're not called moortugal for no reason, 
  oh , yeah ? , i 'm going to start my own castilian with blackjack and hookers !, 
   i 'd really like your academy and wish ours was more alike yours . 
  your orthography mirrors the pronunciation quite well . 
  i ' not trying to be arrogant ( sorry if that was the feeling i was passing ) i was wishing all people could stop confusing english with british and united kingdomsian ... 
  attention !, 
  nortern spain has a great share of blonde people . 
  you san marines are different from everything on europe, 
  from what i 've learned from a brazilian , you ca n't go around telling people what is the correct pronunciation or not !, 
  that ' so rude !, 
  ^ i ^ envy ^ the ^ recognition ^ your ^ european ^ variation ^ has, 
   not all of spain is mediterranean , we 've got a big atlantic coast . 
  i think they know it , and they remember going there to see lisbon, 
  well ... some espanh\u00f3is live there , if i 'm not mistaken, 
  btw , how much do you want for the 2004 cup ? 
  spanish airways is called iberia , although they are n't iberia too . 
  they just chose it because the bulk of population lives there . 
  you know what ? 
  the more and more i read on r/europe the more i wish people have real geography lessons and this would happen less often, 
  nope . 
  at least in portuguese , which may explain the mistake you guys should seriously consider rescuing the word `` briton '' to someone from great britan or call the people from british islands, 
  thank you for delivering . 
  was betting on france , because it 's the country that receives influences from every side . 
  2/4 not that bad not sure about 1 , but the rest you can find them on other countries . 
  i 'm curious to know what country it is, 
  also in portugal , at least should have been quite common throughout europe in medieval times , though, 
  please ladies , mate with me !, 
  i am an extinguishing breed !, 
  i 'm sure you never saw anything similar back in m\u00e9xico, 
  wow !, 
  such detail !, 
  200 meters ? 
  some redditor could explain me how a single non atomic bomb do such damage ? 
  the good old reconquista legends , full of moor princesses , holy apparitions and hidden treasures, 
  all politicians from madeira ( aka jo\u00e3o alberto jardim ) call the continentals cubans, 
  [ a pool with money ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_litmznmsqa1qc9wlr.jpg ), 
  the cubans do not control madeira !, 
  madeira is autonomous and stronk !, 
   also got ta love `` maghreb '' extending south towards nigeria . 
  they got it from playing risk, 
  he 's already revolving in his tomb after hearing about this, 
  about that , if you do n't mind ... , funny story , actually , and this might sound stupid , but 200 years ago when the french came over to play we left [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliven%c3%a7a ) at your place . 
  could we have it back ?
