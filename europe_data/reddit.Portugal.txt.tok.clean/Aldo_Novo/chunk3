  catalonia is awesome too . 
  if was n't for your [ diversion maneuver ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerra_dels_segadors ) we would also be referending for [ independence ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerra_de_restauraci%c3%b3_portuguesa ), 
  i guess we encountered the rare subspecies of basque that loves castille . 
  normally they are very wild and ~ ~ explosive ~ ~ impulsive animals , but some are captured and tamed until they francoly love and protect their madridilian masters . 
  not on the western andalus front, 
  let 's just hope op will post the numbers for the [ tie people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cravat ), 
  now i realized . 
  i too often mistake `` bottom '' for down  san marino is on the bottom of the part of italy that is in continental europe . 
  he probably meant top . 
  you guys are our only * vizinhos * . 
  it is . 
  on the bottom . 
  but not on the islands . 
  i think that 's what he was trying to say . 
  why did i even involved in this discussion ... europe is just that same foreign land beyond spain ... 
  he is taking out sardinia , sicily and other italian islands, 
  does n't matter , table football only accepts 20 cent coins . 
  do n't listen to him , come to the infinitely small grain sandy beaches of the atlantic coast !, 
  ^ 120 $ / night , ^ non ^ negotiable, 
  if you said that in portugal , we would all be thinking you mentioned prostitution, 
  the point is that when facing a decentralized guerrilha group and not an organized state , things are n't easy . 
  not even the usa , which has way more military resources , can fight and win them , so why france , that has faced only that kind of wars , should be called pathetic ? 
  would syria and iraq have fewer arid areas because they are near the coast or would it increase because tigris and euphrates are born in turkey ? 
  the iberian peninsula would have identity issues . 
  we 're speaking as europe . 
  every portuguese considers our government to blame . 
  the portuguese army could not do any harm even if it wanted to . 
  by that definition of war defeat the usa has also lost in vietnam , iraq and afghanistan ^ just ^ saying, 
  actually , i found it very similar . 
  the sound was it , but it was said much slower ( anyway you guys are known for that ) . 
  maybe the change in writing comes from `` es '' part that changes how '' \u00f5 '' sounds . 
  however almost all words come with '' \u00f5 '' have `` es '' next to it that in practice you may call it a different thing, 
  i guess your \u00f5 has nothing to do with ours , does it ? 
  oil . 
  and that 's why they 're so smooth and without friction too, 
  it had to be someone not eastern european to cut their crap . 
  also , can portugal into western ? 
  good point . 
  but still very much on the east of europe ( if we forget the hugeness of russia ) . 
  like portugal , the westernmost country in europe , and considered a southern country, 
  what is needed to be considered eastern europe than just being in the east part of europe ? 
  and putting faro instead of lisbon, 
  so , this is path of immigration : ukraine -  russia -  bulgaria -  turkey -  germany -  switzerland, 
  paying the bills . 
  we 're almost a 1/5 of the [ people there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_luxembourger ) . 
  in absolute numbers , we export ourselves more to france , but luxemburg has fewer arabs going there , so that 's why we become relevant there, 
  and yet some piigs would sacrifice virgins for that number, 
  you 're right . 
  portuguese immigrants often swear that they only will come back if the country is reseted , but if there is no one with the will to make the change ... 
  fortunately [ mariana mort\u00e1gua ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/espirito-santo-probe-turns-mariana-mortagua-into-portuguese-star ) was there to cut the crap, 
  the amount of corruption in this case is so big that the president of portugal advised people last summer that the shares of the bank bes were completely safe to invest when he knew from the director of bank of portugal since november 2013 that bes was on the risk of failure, 
  then eating your own feces is a normal thing , since it 's legal . 
  and people are starting to go out and trying to convince other people that eating their shit is good . 
  some things are just legal because they are not harmful . 
  otherwise there would be no laws , just a really huge list of behaviors considered ok and a ^ really ^ tiny ^ democracy, 
  he 's hinting at this [ law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_lgbt_propaganda_law ), 
  could someone explain the story to a guy who saw it and still did n't understand ? 
  the southern countries are also quite good at redefining the meaning of words . 
  like public-private partnerships ( [ ppp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public%e2%80%93private_partnership ) ) , that means now the private has the profits * without * the risk and spending, 
  good way to treat your oldest ally . 
  we resent it so much we sing an [ hate song against you english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_portuguesa ) before all football games, 
  i guess no one has still produced a original , descriptive , consensual and enduring name for the country and people between belgium , germany , and france ( if you count the kingdom ), 
  i 'm not the only one anoyed with that law !, 
  in portugal , marmelade only refers to jam made of [ quince ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quince#uses ) , that we call `` marmelo '' , so this is a really stupid for two reasons . 
  they counted ** culture ** diversity , not ** race ** most people in usa speak mainly english and castillan , they are of any color most people in estonia speak mainly estonian and russian , they are white mostly, 
  i ca n't wait for new lahore united vs new lahore city . 
  or new rawalpindi fc vs new west not-halal united, 
  `` nu '' means naked in portuguese , that would be encouragement if netherlands is trying to score, 
  it 's only wrong if you think it is . 
  also , does n't netherlands also apply to belgium and parts of france ? 
  wait !, 
  i googled `` belgium '' and had no results !, 
  you made that up !, 
  and ** i thought ** lisbon was the hq of caracol liberals ... 
  portugal has been around for almost a 1000 years or so . 
  you guys just got independent from spain 400 years ago , just wait 600 more and the thing kinda grows on you , 
  neerland\u00eas sounds so weird to the portuguese that it looks like some dutch guy made it up . 
  it 's very rare ( like lottery rare ) to have the same letter repeated consecutively in a portuguese word , so i do n't even wonder why we still use `` holand\u00eas '' instead of that unpronounceable thing, 
  actually portugal is the evolution of the name of the city porto ( it was called the `` port of cale '' - portus cale '' ) , so ... yeah , it was something similar that happened and nobody feels or ever felt less portuguese because of it, 
  and to all who mock the french , we got some of the [ good stuff too . . ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lag2bhfyydm/ucjoethhk7i/aaaaaaaaags/5itjggffcym/s1600/pratada-carac%c3%b3is-sassoeiros.jpg ), 
  and [ capela dos ossos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capela_dos_ossos ) , if you are into that sort of thing, 
  than you are prepared !, 
  still , i recommend you to go to [ alentejo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alentejo ) . 
  [ m\u00e9rtola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a9rtola ) , [ \u00c9vora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89vora ) and [ elvas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elvas ) are definitely places to go . 
  i would advise you to try [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) too , but it 's under occupation . 
  and swearing . 
  lots and lots of swearing, 
   i 'm too spoiled by german/dutch bicycle paths , i guess . 
  and given that information , let me remind you that portugal is really h ^ i l ^ l y, 
  they still would have an [ eurovision victory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ) ... 
  maybe we could sue someone over copyright infringement to get out of debt , 
  they portray us like some stupid backwards moustached folk ( the moustached part may be [ true ] ( http://www.nationalstereotype.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jokes-about-portuguese-stereotypes-2.jpg ) ) that always runs a bakery in brazil and everyone is called manuel ou maria . 
  we 're also the target of their jokes , like the french do with with the belgians . 
  ( ex : a portugueseman won for prize a pajamas . 
  he liked it so much he only wears it of at night ! ), 
  that 's specially unfortunate for the [ alentejans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alentejo ) , since they are the target of our jokes , making them some kind of joke inception . 
  it 's a style of music originated in angola that evolved in portugal ( there 's a strong community from the [ palops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese-speaking_african_countries ) in lisbon ) and added more eletronic elements . 
  since the last decade it became more popular , mainly because of [ buraka sound system ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ckxhtw7unk ) and some songs even received airtime ( our national radios are a monopoly with an anglophone bias ) . 
  there are other african music styles popular in portugal , like [ kizomba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dezh4sxxilo ) ( that everybody complains [ all songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmth10wzomk ) sound the [ same !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqqkb0623ta ) ) .
