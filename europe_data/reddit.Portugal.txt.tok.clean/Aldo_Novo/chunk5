  and there 's also this [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/4x8ed1/alfama_lisboa_pintura_holandesa_s%c3%a9culo_xvi/ ), 
  alentejo pushes it upward . 
  if we did not count them we would have numbers similar to greece or italy . 
  if you uncerstand portuguese read this : http://observador.pt/especiais/no-alentejo-suicidio-natural/, 
  yeah , so nice . 
  let 's all go to prison , yay !, 
  do n't all languages have common ancestry ? 
  that 's what * they * want us to think, 
  dude , we are aware of that , it 's just a running gag : dutch - swamp germans austrians and swiss - mountain germans scandinavians - north germans, 
  what would you think if moldova joined the union ? 
  ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ please ^ ^ luso ^ ^ block ^ ^ best ^ ^ block ^ ^ reddit ^ ^ can \u00b4 t ^ ^ handle ^ ^ the ^ ^ \u00e7edilha, 
  hahahaha , the problem it 's not that you are on atlantic , it 's you are too much up north to be suitable to humans, 
   how do you feel about pan-latinism ? 
  this is not a thing . 
   non-latinos , how do you feel about latins ? 
  i think in english you say `` non-latins '' . 
  i hope they are okay , i guess . 
   and i 'm proposing for the eu to move its capital to rome and put spqr on it 's flag . 
  what would be the point ? 
  brussels is already a latin majority area . 
  and what about the non-latins of the eu ? 
  you ca n't just point at regions and call them a country, 
  i disagreee , let 's be even more : scotland is not a country and the label says european countries , so it should be uk ... 
  ok , that was incorrect from my part . 
  ireland is a part of the british isles but not a british island, 
  [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ), 
  british is someone or something from the british islands . 
  if you are a citizen of the uk or not , i do not care . 
  more like a hispanic . 
  although kings from both countries used the title emperor of the spains ( or something close to it ) . 
  the irish seem very keen to explain this to everybody else , although no one agrees with them . 
  well , since portugal follows the long scale system , we do n't have billionaires either, 
  you are british as much as canadians are north americans, 
  that sneaky tram, 
  is this for real ? 
  would like some more context, 
  yes , it means `` kings '', 
  for individuals it does n't matter , for populations it might have some relevance , yes, 
  only to register that describing individuals genetically is meaningless, 
  even if they were , which i find hard to believe , you would have cases like zach galifianakis or tina fey , who genetically register as greek but definitely do not define themselves as such, 
  u/foreverjamon , internationalize your know how , please, 
  nope , none of these countries have a sizable irish community . 
  [ the irish diaspora is mostly on usa and uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_diaspora#list_of_countries_by_population_of_irish_heritage ) , who are the reason for the holiday becoming popular , since ameriboos want to try it and companies find an opportunity to sell stuff . 
  for normal europeans , it 's just an artificial party , like halloween, 
  heritage sites in europe you might not know of : - giant 's causeway , ireland ; - altamira cave , spain . 
  on the next issue , american unknown monuments that would deserve your attention : - the statue of liberty ; - the grand canyon ;, 
  that also applies to portuenses that think the north goes from braga to gaia and from matosinhos to paredes, 
  [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallaeci ) [ do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britonia ), 
  and for the same reason , it is clear that english and scots are clearly languages from different families ... / s, 
  0/10 would not troll again, 
  as one says when in portuguese when they had enough ? 
  edit : after all this word is more international than i thought . 
  having been on both cities during winter , it 's still colder in evora than in setubal, 
  the point is to not aid any separatism in any form so it does not become a success and potentially increase support for its domestic separatists . 
  for the same reason kosovo is not recognized by spain, 
  do n't lie to people . 
  setubal is near the sea and winter temperatures are never that cold inner regions like alto alentejo or beira baixa experience similar summer temperatures but have far more colder winters, 
  are n't those the same islands of the whirlpool ? 
  if you are on the british isles -  british, 
  those are british, 
  most of these cultures were long gone by the time of barbarian invasions, 
   jumbo i think the barbarians on the far east beyond the mountains say auchan, 
  your president ? 
  should we prepare the rooms in estoril for felipe ? 
  calling it `` casa '' ( house ) would also be common, 
  it seems to be a [ calla lily ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zantedeschia_aethiopica ) ( jarro in portuguese ) . 
  it 's odd that you found it there , because they usually are found near water , unlike that place , by the looks of your picture . 
  [ our guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofa06uqdq8 ), 
  it is the closest organization to the american county , which divides each state into smaller subdivisions anyway , municipality is a much better translation for that term . 
  it is due to mistaking county/city . 
  as well as gaia , amadora is a different county than porto or lisbon , but are part of the same city . 
  how can you be a nation state if you 're made of more than one nation ? 
  [ a traditional carnaval parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy6_t1r_vem ) they will run the streets and jingle their bells to women . 
  nowadays there are also parades copying your style of carnaval , which is a frankly stupid thing to o when it is 10\u00bac outside, 
  it 's remisga , but let 's agree to disagree, 
  wine and beer are like the bread of booze : you can mix them with anything and it will be okay, 
  they really were geese , they had a straight neck and aimed straight at the sandwich i was eating, 
  i 've run from geese in that lake, 
  it is . 
  portugal produces pineapples though . 
  doubt any of it reaches lithuania still, 
   i guess it 's okay to call my son viriato now . 
  * implying * * it * * is * * not * * the * * best * * name * * ever *, 
  well , i do n't want to nitpick , but looking at your flair i have to say the constantinople sieges did not happen in your country . 
  and american mass marketing, 
  as far as i know , the only trees forbidden to cut are the mistletoe and the corktree, 
  although it was not endemic to most of these countries . 
  is it a fascination with exotic animals ? 
  much better, 
  yeah , a serra da estrela would be a much more popular breed, 
  we 've also introduced fios de ovos to thailand, 
   they are just a mix of ethnicities you just described all ethnicities . 
  and what do you think [ are ] ( https://ogimg.infoglobo.com.br/in/18001046-646-3f0/ft1086a/420/xronaldinho_barcelona.jpg.pagespeed.ic.o3aj_l4oln.jpg ) [ these ] ( https://laradiodelsur.com.ve/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lula.jpg ) people 's [ ethincities ? 
  ] ( https://1k95i3bqziq3bboq03r87f8x-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/reagan-trump.jpg ), 
  except there are many ethnicities who have very different appearances , like brazilians , arabs , americans ... 
  [ look at that non-whiteness ] ( http://www.newscrab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kremlin-slams-us-threats-against-syrias-bashar-al-assad.jpg ), 
  like i said , some categories should overlap, 
  some of these categories should overlap : spain and portugal are the westernmost countries of europe . 
  romania , bulgaria and greece are part of the balkans . 
  and as long as eastern thrace is still in europe , turkey is also an european country,
