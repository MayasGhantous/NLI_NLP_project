  why only boy ? 
  for a romance speaker all three are clearly female, 
  ah , much better, 
  was really hoping to see the flag of now with white and blue background but come to find that travesty :(, 
  they basically painted it brown and called it a day, 
  speaking for myself , but it is complicated . 
  `` talin '' reads the same way as `` tallinn '' so it ' hard to remember which letters are there twice and which do n't, 
  hungary is something else too, 
   those are different withing portugal . 
  even the names of cooking : estrugido/refogado . 
  we just happen to share them . 
  hoowever there many products that are common to us . 
  when anthony bordain did his episode on mozambique he was served carca\u00e7as , cape verdians eat a lot of cod , we can find brigadeiro cakes in portugal ...  portugal 's catholicism is focus around f\u00e1tima . 
  brazil has a growing evangelist population . 
  portugal has a growing evangelist population too . 
  our roots are still on catholicism . 
   unfortunately , the media is barely shared between the palops . 
  portugal gets brazilian soap operas , and that 's it . 
  that 's a lot more than any other country can say , besides the usa with their movies . 
  but brazilian soap operas and music have deeper penetration on our population . 
   but in terms of nowadays portugal and portuguese people , we get more attached to some european countries such as spain , france or even luxembourg than with brazil with exactly what ? 
  lots of people support brazil on sports when portugal is not participating , if you call that attachment, 
  recipes , literature , religion , references of media . 
  anything other europeans might share in common with us , they would too, 
  slightly related , but does china own all pandas in the world ? 
  that 's not a good example for places without linguistic ties though . 
  there was a language continuum after all . 
  i think spain , brazil and palops are the ones closest to our culture . 
  then it would be other europeans, 
  but any of those values and principles are cherished not only by europeans , but by most of the world population . 
  you just got lucky to be born on a country whose government has decided to respect and implement them, 
  the same way usa has the biggest jewish and irish diaspora . 
  huge amounts of people immigrated there in the xix and xx century, 
  some would say language is part of culture, 
  why not king consort ? 
  seems a bit sexist, 
  absolutely . 
  just like asian \u2260 having slanted eyes . 
  it 's more like saying pest is not part of buda actually porto and gaia are really well connected , they do n't have 15km of river between them, 
  gaia is porto in everything but for voting on mayor, 
  those are all americans, 
  port wine or vinho do porto . 
  porto wine is neither meat nor fish, 
  hot damn, 
   * dependencies counted under parent state . 
  how goofy do you find `` crac\u00f3via '' ? 
  does n't mather much if it does n't attract people, 
  yeah , not so bad . 
  the dude could be uglier, 
  what growth ? 
  there is no population growth, 
  because of the ocean distance , [ maps of portugal ] ( http://www.maps-of-europe.net/maps/maps-of-portugal/detailed-physical-map-of-portugal-with-all-roads-cities-and-airports.jpg ) display the islands on boxes next to the mainland , \u00e0 la [ alaska ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/map_of_usa_with_state_names.svg/2000px-map_of_usa_with_state_names.svg.png ) , which makes difficult to grasp the real size and distance between the islands, 
  if you only count mainland part , then uk 's should be 427m on gibraltar and iceland , ireland , malta , and cyprus should be blank, 
  is n't this more `` number of redditors subscribed to country 's subreddit per 100 ' 000 people of said country '' ? 
  because she 's not doing most of the work . 
  she just does a bit o diplomacy here and there , it 's not a comparable job, 
  not to mention all the naughty runs on fields, 
  we are eastern europe in our hearts, 
   once upon a time i was quite happy with her . 
  are you malato ? 
  that 's were merche romero came from, 
  why `` actually '' ? 
  azores are still portugal, 
  what do you call galician , asturian and aragonese ? 
  it 's not like any languages in scotland besides english are widely spoken, 
  it is a bit more than just naming them . 
  greeks accuse macedonians of reclaiming greek macedonian symbols ( like alexander the great ) for themselves , so this is a way of getting back at them, 
   and you 're already a well-known troll in / r/portugal oh buga , atingiste o c\u00famulo . 
  never is a strong word . 
  not in 1900 , but some of it was under portuguese control, 
  culture and selfdescription seems pretty straightforward, 
  how is qi supposed to be pronounced ? 
  like ki ? 
  more like there are 20k ice-aboos, 
  if you want to be precise , it 's not like those are completely different concepts ( and iron path is even more metal imo ), 
  it 's also the name in portuguese and french : `` caminho de ferro '' and `` chemin de fer '', 
  because we do n't do that `` ruled by us but it 's not part of our country '' bullshit like the netherlands , denmark and the uk do . 
  even if the azores are special region with more autonomy , they are considered as much portuguese as lisbon . 
  i said usually . 
  there 's also about the existence of infrastructure ( schools , hospitals , museums , etc ) . 
  anyway algueir\u00e3o-mem martins is basically a suburb of lisbon , so it 's not the best example of a vila, 
  vilas are usually much smaller than 11k habitants , more like 1 or 2 thousand, 
  that 's was not our discussion and i do n't think it should a thing for us foreigners to decide . 
  personally , i am for a independence referendum and see what their opinion is but would not loose my sleep if it did n't happen, 
  scotland is an autonomous region of uk too , if you 're going by that . 
  official nomenclature might not be it , but both enjoy the same liberties and rights under a more central government , so it is just a matter of chance that the spanish constitution decided to call them autonomous regions instead of constituent countries . 
  so considering one a country but not the other is incoherent, 
  say at least one thing that qualifies scotland as a country but not catalonia, 
  catalonia is as much of a country as scotland and wales are, 
  the whole of slovenia would belong to us now . 
  they have signs with kona on every corner, 
  please yes, 
  you can tell it by the way it ts, 
  salazar , tungsten , nazi, 
  only ? 
  there are n't many countries older than that, 
  [ santamaria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avwiuw21rgu ) must [ count , no ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmhkft09ur0 ) also : [ excesso - eu sou aquele ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxmqzzewi0q ) [ d'arrasar - a rainha da noite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_dn3fkbytk ) although not portuguese , [ iran costa 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6sfoqsddak ) and [ luka 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meadbab15ia ) songs were also big on portugal . 
  have no idea . 
  it 's not like the ovens this side of the border do not reach 200 \u00bac,
