  i bet you do n't even like farinheira and peel off the chorizo, 
  you are part of the anglophone world , whether you like it or not . 
  the country is actually not that small , for european standards, 
  or some people do n't want to but have to, 
  not all of them , though . 
  for example , ceuta would still appear, 
  the map is wrong . 
  portugal should have a bit more land on the south ( the town of oliven\u00e7a ) and some possessions on north africa, 
  that 's rich coming from a country who only paid their debts from the xix century in 2001 and still suffers from the late industrialization, 
  it translates to `` aladeen '', 
  op , are you really from the country in your flair ? 
  either you are not from an eurozone country or you did not learn this today . 
  the naming order in portugal was only standardized in the second half of the xx century . 
  before that , it was legal to register kids from the same parents with different surnames , some children were also registered with the surnames of their godfathers , girls would receive the maternal surname and boys would receive the paternal surname . 
   in portugal that rarely happens even if the father name is more common . 
  following your piece of trivia , one of the few portuguese known for their mother 's surname was ant\u00f3nio de oliveira salazar , whose name followed the traditional spanish naming order . 
  otherwise , oliveira slytherin would not sound as frightening . 
  * 43 years, 
  wow , , those feet are ripped,

  the journalist saw this as a good thing , but i do n't think he researched this subject very well or otherwise he would have find the [ methuen treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methuen_treaty ) and how trading wine for cloth actually crippled our economy .

  the borders are not quite the same , but the map shows the actual borders + the north african possesions .

  greece . 
  fairly similar weather , a bit more area and a lot more islands . 
  plus , we 'd have more neighbours, 
  they have a nice ham , nice caramels and cheap clothing . 
  our countries get along just fine, 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you , just remember the north is not just the land between porto and braga . 
  anyway , the best way to look at living conditions is to look big cities vs small cities rather than north vs south, 
  aveiro is not in the north , but what you described applies to it and to every other city near the cp-porto suburban lines . 
  in no other northern cities does industry have as much importance and agriculture takes a bigger role . 
  not to forget alto t\u00e2mega and terras de tr\u00e1s os montes are the poorest regions in portugal . 
  wet vs dry winters are more of a thing west vs east rather than north vs south . 
  transport tends to be a bit shit on other cities besides those between porto and braga , but those are the ones with the biggest population so it 's no wonder why there is n't a better service, 
  never met someone from portalegre . 
  however i believe there must someone out there, 
  there are n't , but i strongly defend reorganizing our municipalities limits and merging many of them . 
  what you said about the north only applies to the braga - porto axis, 
  these are some i remember : that taiwan dude always asking questions ; the american who is always asking how to survive in europe on welfare ; the estonian nationalist ; the basque metro ; the portuguese-french-dutch gay dude ; the north korean flair guy that is not north korean, 
  there are on this . 
  and on every other thread that comes up on this sub asking our take on random usa state . 
  those questions are a bit silly , because the opinion of it is inseparable from the opinion of the whole country and most of the times users answer with general trivia taken from wikipedia,

  [ this flag ] ( http://c4.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/bfe13f5cb/15537247_6vs5i.png ) is used by monarchists .

  yeah , one of the versions of the boogeyman was the gypsy and the bag, 
  here you will notice some gypsies from the rest of the population because of the long beards , the dark clothing and the distinctive accent . 
  the most integrated gypsies tend to have none of those characteristics so you will only recognize them as a gypsy if you know them personally . 
  i had an acquaintance in high school that was gypsy and only knew that when i saw her helping her parents at the fair,
