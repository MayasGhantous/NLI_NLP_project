  besides him , there are only two other songs in portuguese, 
  as any other country, 
  if anything , the us has a more generous view of brits , germans and irish because it is mostly their ( reported ) ancestry, 
  if anything , ceuta should go back to us . 
  i mean , look at their [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/flag_ceuta.svg/1280px-flag_ceuta.svg.png ), 
  [ g\u00e2ndola vila morena - zeca afonso ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=galwqy4e7ls ) : gr\u00e2ndola is just a town , but the song took a huge role on the revolution of ' 74 ; [ coimbra tem mais encanto - fernando machado soares ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asqqxq6h7du ) : about coimbra , popular among students of said city 's university ; [ lisboa menina e mo\u00e7a - carlos do carmo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdrm2djqdws ) : one of the most known fado songs ; [ indo eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwuuypsfj0 ) : children 's song about viseu . 
  without counting those from cplp , i would say `` nice '' and then moving on with my life, 
  low wages, 
  except it is a problem in portugal too, 
  you ca n't drink wine after eating watermelon there are no graves for the chinese because they eat their dead there was this girl who lived alone and went to the bathroom at home . 
  when she sat down the seat was warm . 
  porto and the ave and c\u00e1vado valleys, 
   `` a nation with its own government , occupying a particular territory . '', 
  all the other meanings are about being rural areas or estates , which makes scotland not a country . 
  [ it 's a common mistake ] ( https://imgur.com/xpkv1vk ) :p, 
  in portuguese camisola is any kind of shirt, 
  you can call it a country , like i can call a whale a fish . 
  but in the end , it 's a mammal, 
  what are the other countries that have carca\u00e7a , broa de milho and p\u00e3o com chouri\u00e7o ? 
  because those ones are my favourites, 
  america : argentina ; africa : cape verde ; asia : mongolia ; europe : slovenia ; oceania : papua new guinea, 
  i just try to guess what they 're saying . 
  it 's easy with romance laguages , but when it 's slavs oh boy ... 
  the [ savage islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savage_islands ) are the furthest you can theoretically go , but they are somewhat closed to the public as they are a nature reserve . 
  on the continent , my bet would be either on alentejo or in [ peneda ger\u00eas national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peneda-ger%c3%aas_national_park ), 
  camisola interior de al\u00e7as , or just camisola interior . 
  translated it means sleeveless undershirt or undershirt, 
  if it 's not sovereign , it 's not a country . 
  scotland is not sovereign , so it 's not a country . 
  but only after a serious referendum where the independence vote wins , not something \u00e0 la crimea, 
  pineapple fanta ftw, 
  from classes 1 to 9 you are graded  90 % - excellent , 90-70 % - exceeds expectations ; 70-50 % - achieves expectations ; < 50 % - does n't achieve expectations . 
  from grade 10 to universitiy you are graded 1-20 , being 20 the highest mark and 9,5 the minimum to pass . 
  2 - depends on the year and how schools set up the schedule . 
  but 10th and 11th years require more time spent on school , since you have to study for university exams on 12th year . 
  3 - the curriculum is set by the ministry of education . 
  after 9th grade you choose a high school course which will give you some fundamentals more specialized on the area you pretend to follow after high school ( it 's either humanities , economics , arts , or science and technology if you ~ ~ pretend ~ ~ intend to study in university and there are a fuckton of technical courses if you just want to start working ) . 
  4 - yes . 
  there 's a national assigned curriculum for each year . 
  the order of subjects might change from teacher to teacher , but you still have to fulfill it by the end of the year . 
  5 - the only optional class is religion and moral . 
  you can choose what languages you learn through 7th to 11th grade ( english + spanish/french/german / latin ) and which 2 classes to learn besides the obligatory maths , portugese and pe ( biology and psicology are the most popular ) . 
  6 - there is on mine . 
  nothing against it , only that some teachers do n't realize they 're not the only ones sending homework and students get overworked . 
  if the eu breaks apart then relationships between european nations would already be not so great by that time , no ? 
  no mr officer , please do n't hurt me and do n't look at my passport, 
  none . 
  although we 're not very good on competitive aspects , volleyball is practiced by many on high schools and beaches, 
  a president still holds some political power and usually mediates between opposition and government , besides the tasks that come with being the figurehead of a state . 
  i rather thrust them to someone i can choose . 
  there would also be coronations to spend money on , although there would be definitely much lesser coronations than elections . 
  a president is better than a king . 
  we can choose a president and the giving special powers to someone just because they were born in the right family is unjust . 
  what about morocco ? 
  not very common though . 
  not only expressions involving neighbors countries , but also other foreign people as well . 
  for me this is greek/chinese - not understanding a thing ; from spain it does not come a good wind nor a good marriage - a saying advicing general mistrust of everything spanish ; rome and pavia were n't build in a day - do n't rush things ; who has a mouth goes to rome - you 'll find answers if you ask questions ; do it big and french - be ostentatious and luxurious ; spending my latin - talking to someone without them paying attention/hearing what you said ; indian queue - a queue where people are ordinated in a straight line facing the back of the person in front of them ; legs on chinese way - [ sitting like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vnxbkvvcp0a/rvq7poi39ji/aaaaaaaaaie/tzcbj0nukiq/s320/pernas+%c3%a0+chines.jpg ) ; having an eye on the donkey and the other on the gipsy - paying attention to not get fooled ; ink-from-china - indian ink ; you 're such a galician - you are confused , incoherent ; low countries - the groin area ; the `` spanish '' - boobjob . 
  seems about right . 
  i always picture pnr voters as old reactionary men who write long incoherent tirades on online news commentary sections . 
  there 's also ketchup , sour cream and onion , and pringles sells paprika . 
  from time to time limited editions appear , like red onion , curry , 4 cheeses , bbq , and salt and pepper , but sincerely , never saw someone eat any of those . 
  old money families still control an important part of the economy like in everywhere , but people who held actual nobility titles are barely relevant . 
  the monarchic part is a joke and there 's no clear heir to the throne . 
  from time to time the `` royal family '' and other supposed blue bloods appear on gossip magazines trying to not be forgotten . 
  if you ask here for a glass of water it will be from the tap and it will b free . 
  however , if you just ask for water then it will be bottled and paying ( 15 $ is a robbery imo , where did that happen ? ), 
  pnr - a extreme right wing party with connections to neonazi groups . 
  of those who got a seat in parliament , i hate the most cds , a populist right wing party, 
  corvo and flores islands . 
  they are too remote for me, 
  redcurrant for sale is n't easy to find either . 
  however , redcurrant concentrate is common and popular to mix on drinks . 
  you might find a better answer on / r/portugal than here, 
  [ link ] ( https://www.pingodoce.pt/produtos/categoria/frescos-frutas-e-legumes/?pagina=5 ) to the fresh produce section of pingo doce ( one of the largest retailers in portugal and poland - there it 's called biedronka ) . 
  farmer 's market will have similar prices , but with the advantage of higher share of local production . 
  imported and out of season fruits are more expensive . 
  the first in-season fruit tends to also be expensive ( cherries can reach to 6 $ / kg ), 
  yep . 
  they are very useful when the baker comes around, 
  not racist . 
  it 's used to describe mixed black/white people and light skinned black people, 
  breakfast cereals , a toast or sandwhich with milk or yoghurt, 
  yes . 
  you can see it by the shit they pass on is catered to old people, 
  [ there are about 110 million russians in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_russia ) . 
  and there are also native speakers in neighboring countries , pushing this count a few millions up, 
   the language that has more native speakers in europe is german . 
  it 's russian actually, 
  but all of them are catholics or agnostics that try to pass as non practicing catholics , so it does n't matter . 
  how are those tests supposed to be reliable anyway ? 
  ethnicity is not measured by dna . 
  excluding footballers , because otherwise the list would be enormous , and people born in what was portuguese territory at the moment they were born : [ ljubomir stanisic ] ( http://www.novagente.pt/sites/default/files/styles/slider/public/images/noticia/2017/2017-03/2017-03-18/nova-gente-55862-noticia-ljubomir-stanisic-chef-de-pesadelo-na-cozinha-sentiu-se-mal_18.jpg?itok=lgg4bewg ) - yugoslav , cheff and tv star ; [ b\u00e9t\u00e3o ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dfmzn-ifi7c/maxresdefault.jpg ) - production assistant of many tv shows , became know for his frequent cameos ; [ orsi feh\u00e9r ] ( http://images-cdn.impresa.pt/caras/2017-01-25-2017-01-25_171448.jpg?mw=820 ) - hungarian tv show presenter , sister of the deceased footballer mikl\u00f3s feher ; [ merche romero ] ( http://www.iol.pt/multimedia/oratvi/multimedia/imagem/id/8817595/800 ) - andorran model and tv show presenter , ex girlfriend of cristiano ronaldo ; [ carlos pereira ] ( https://scontent.fopo1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17799942_1924324954470337_1362410954026657994_n.jpg?oh=6e9b6e76b5e8ef076a04c52b631f4523&amp;oe=5a02ccc7 ) - from s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and pr\u00edncipe , humourist ; [ marco hor\u00e1cio ] ( http://thumbs.web.sapo.io/?w=900&amp;h=450&amp;crop=face&amp;tv=1&amp;delay_optim=1&amp;epic=v2%3aai4d9v3jouusrjps79f4ydjfil7keqhr91tv92qlubodxzqdz80gs8sbeixismxvx8wpv1cx1zh4og%2bi7tegixtegxtcltw729vpmylfqm7qgur4nwilmvshhd%2fmjde9 ) - born in germany from portuguese emigrants , actor and humourist ;, 
  there is no tradition of it here . 
  some people might complain about stuff getting corroded . 
  most likely, 
  why ? , do you like spanish mediterranean towns ? 
  putting salt on watermelon or eating it with a spoon - never seen , would frame you as a lunatic and a waster of perfectly good watermelon . 
  just cut a piece for you and share the rest with the others . 
  for regular melons , eating it with ham is nice . 
  if you are feeling a bit sophisticated , you can cut canteloupes in halves , remove the seeds , mix any fruits inside and eat it with a spoon .
