  they 're not very frequent , but i can think of `` franco '' ( frank ) , portugal , holanda ( netherlands ) and montenegro . 
  portuguese surnames are more about professions and patronymics than demonyms . 
  `` meteorol\u00f3gico '' ( meteorologic ) - metrel\u00f3gico `` treze '' ( thirteen ) - tre\u00faze `` lenha '' ( firewood ) - lanha `` piscina '' ( swimming pool ) - either as pissina or pishina , or even worse , pshina, 
  yeah , in portuguese there was some serious backlash when we had our own ortographical reforms and removed some silent letters . 
  everybody complained , but once it went on effect it turned out to be very practical . 
  i 'm an outsider , but i think french needs also a serious orthographic reform . 
  you almost never pronounce the ends of your words, 
  not usually , because outlets tend to be very sturdy , but if i were on my grandma 's house i would do that, 
  it is big . 
  but is also annoying since all songs sound equal because the rhythm is always the same , the singers sound the same and the lyrics are shalow and make no sense . 
  despacito and that fucking future song are the most annoying hits this summer . 
  ( not a native spanish speaker , but a fellow victim ), 
  france uk switzerland they come on summer and sometimes on special holidays throughout the year . 
  the ones from switzerland always bring chocolate tablets , so it 's nice . 
  tvi has the cassette with the video of batatinha and companhia fighting , but wo n't release it . 
  if you want to find anything on the supermarket , it 's hidden behind the frozen chicken nuggets on auchan . 
  the copypasta : you only comment shit , dude . 
  today i 've already seen a bunch of your comments saying shit without a single time being on topic or productive . 
  stop spamming please .

  it is like that . 
  you only learn to play the bisel flute and some music theory . 
  it 's valid , but it does n't feel natural . 
  and there 's the aspect when the adjective is before the noun it gives a more figurative aspect than a literal one, 
  music classes are part of the curriculum of the 5th and 6th grade and in some schools until the 9th . 
  there might also school choirs , music , theater , astronomy , sports clubs where you might learn a bit more than the standard curriculum but it differs much from school to school edit : there are also the chapit\u00f4 ( circus school ) and the national conservatoriums at porto and lisbon where you specifically learn music , and some high technical schools offer to learn the trade of musician, 
  and people from the islands drink mainly coral, 
  it 's called gam\u00e3o in portuguese . 
  but never played it . 
  and never saw someone who could, 
  i do n't think about them at all . 
  but since you brought the subject , they seem to lack their right to self determination and the ability to be a complete citizen on their own country , which is very imperialistic from the usa . 
  if you take an active role on volleyball , then you are constantly moving around . 
  you have to always be aware of your positioning , you never rest your arms and sometimes have to make those power sprints to cover your teammates, 
  if you do n't sweat playing volleyball , you 're doing it wrong, 
  nope . 
  the jokes limited to reddit are about finland and potatoes, 
  how is that in anyway reasonable ? 
  who designed welsh orthography ? 
  it changed european portugal 's borders when it passed to spanish hands in the xix century and even if you go by de jure borders , portugal stopped having a border with china in 1999 ... so our borders are not the oldest, 
  dude , i have to tell you that 's one of weirdest ways of washing your feet , just below those spas with the little fishes that eat the dead skin, 
  op asked weird things to foreigners in spain . 
  it does n't matter if it happens on the whole of spain . 
  touradas and flamenco were also mentioned here , but no one came nitpicking it is only regional instead of a nationwide thing . 
  wow . 
  do you put the feet on the sink or do you just soak them with the water from the sink ? 
  like it or not , catalonia is spanish still, 
  the sink ? 
  or the bidet ? 
  this is exactly like in portugal, 
  handing out macau to china in 1999 , marking the end of the portuguese empire . 
  expo 98 , that also carried heavy investments in infrastructure to renovate lisbon . 
  the independence of timor in 2001 , which although is not portuguese territory , it was seen as a victory of portuguese diplomacy . 
  the change from escudo to using euros . 
  the euro 2004 . 
  the 2008 crisis and the imf intervention winning euro 2016 . 
  i think for us some non-europeans would be regarded sooner as locals than other europeans . 
  brazilians ans palops get assimilated pretty fast, 
  [ well columbus found puerto rico , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_puerto_rico#spanish_rule_.281493.e2.80.931898.29 ) , so i do n't know, 
  m\u00e9dio oriente , which is equivalent to middle east, 
  totally against . 
  what year is this ? 
  never said he was that guy economist hate . 
  just read the second paragraph, 
  who ? 
  salazar or franco ? 
  not that you would be very wrong for any of them, 
  the vast majority of portuguese agrees that under salazar were tough times and nowadays we live with a better quality of life and more opportunities . 
  we are thankful to him for organizing the country 's finances ( still one of the largest gold reserves in the world ) and the neutrality of world war ii . 
  but there is some resentment against him because of the way he handled education and healthcare , how he treated the country that was not lisbon , the repression of free speech and specially the colonial war . 
  the last polemic i 've heard around him was when his home town santa comba d\u00e3o decided to sell salazar cabbages and salazar wine , but it was seen more as distasteful than associated with right wing extremism . 
  we learnt : - it 's the silk route and the place where all the spices came from ; - which lead vasco da gama and company to go there and set an empire around the indian and east african coast ; - corruption , pirates and attacks from other nations lead to the collapse of said empire . 
  - in the 60s , the siege of goa by the indian army , which was one or two orders of magnitude bigger than the portuguese forces , that to the loss of the territories in india . 
  sorry , but there 's nothing scotland has to be considered a country that catalonia or flanders does n't . 
  this is more due to historical weight of those associations or due to the autonomy granted to those regions , like it is the case for the faroe islands and tahiti, 
  the people who left were mostly madeirans and azoreans from lower classes . 
  continentals emigrated mostly to brazil and to the colonies . 
  besides new england , portuguese people also immigrated to hawaii , where the [ cavaquinho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavaquinho ) evolved into the [ ukele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukulele ), 
  what do you think a troubadour is ? 
  without counting the translated version of the iliad , we were taught some plays of gil vicente , which date to beginning of the xvi century . 
  if after completing the 9 years of common curriculum you choose to follow the humanities and languages path , you would also read some troubadour songs from the xiii century, 
  did not knew about that , what do you call a cabide ? 
  never heard it said that way up here on the north, 
  it is supposed to rhyme with cream . 
  in portuguese it is supposed to rhyme with `` creme '' , so you are saying it wrong, 
  garlic soup ? 
  never heard of such thing . 
  closest thing i can imagine is [ canja ] ( https://artesviagensesabores.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/canja.jpg ) , but if it tastes as garlic the cook has taken many gastronomical liberties with that dish, 
  sagres and super bock are just like pepsi and coca-cola : every bar has one of those , but only one brand . 
  on the archipelagos of azores and madeira , they have their own thing , [ coral ] ( http://www.cervejacoral.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/coral_branca.jpg ) , but i 've never seen one on the stores in the continent . 
  and sagres is piss . 
  although most of people could pull a decent standard portuguese , the accent on a casual conversation subtly ( or in some cases , very effusively ) hints to the region of the speaker, 
  never heard of that band , sorry, 
  to be sincere that plan is more about moving the lisbon city centre than moving lisbon . 
  maybe coimbra , which was the capital before and has a more central position than porto ( and also a much better weather ) .
