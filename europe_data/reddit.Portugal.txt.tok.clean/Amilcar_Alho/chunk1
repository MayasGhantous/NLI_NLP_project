[ this is my home town coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89vora#/media/file:evr.png ) , you can figure the rest yourself . 
  turkey is a secular , non-arabic country and that probably makes a difference . 
  good news everyone !, 
  [ we are breeding again !, 
  ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2016/0219/why-are-young-portuguese-suddenly-having-more-babies ), 
  considering they have no problem bombing the kurds but do shit against is i have a hard time agreeing with you . 
  then you should stop them from entering your country and send them back to turkey . 
  ca n't you just use google ? 
  so all those daily rapes and miscellaneous crimes do n't actually bother you that much ? 
  the americans have some sort of exotic infatuation with gypsies , perhaps they can take them . 
  anjem choudary must be one hell of a joker otherwise he should be rotting in jail . 
  i 'm obviously not swedish and maybe something gets lost in the translation but that seems to be just some random person opinion on the matter and not an official government source . 
  brilliant logic backed up with facts . 
   but that is a fact that this sub wont allow to be known . 
  and what stops you from linking your sources . 
  i was n't giving you a genuine answer either . 
  midnight express . 
  turkish prisons are the best . 
  pathological altruism , look it up . 
   dear god , if anyone has perfected food , india and ethiopia have . 
  the best damn e coli i ever had . 
  ... and did n't wash his hands . 
  it 's not just a type of clothing it 's a symbol of oppression and submission that defies secularism . 
  lots of brits over here , they usually wear the same as the locals : flip flops ... sometimes with white socks , 
   no a spaniard and a german does n't look the same . 
  well if germans could just stop using [ white socks & sandals ] ( https://imgur.com/wyqiyph ) they could integrate better . 
  all we know is he ~ ~ is ~ ~ was called the stig . 
  not this . 
  this . 
  many confused foreigners regularly ask this on / r/portugal and someone made this helpful ' [ how-to guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/147wpm/portuguese_friends_why_women_in_this_country_are/c7atlxy ) ' :  not to worry , i 'll break it down for you . 
  with my simple guide , you 'll be meeting portuguese girls in no time at all !, 
  the next time you see an atractive portuguese girl , follow these simple steps :   1 . 
  find out who she is , and what friends you have in common with her . 
  if you do n't have any friends in common , game over . 
  ask your mutual friend to introduce you . 
  if your mutual friend is not there , not available or not willing , game over . 
  once you get introduced , make conversation . 
  be witty , atractive or be both . 
  if you are not either , game over . 
  do n't make a move . 
  if you make a move , probably game over . 
  assuming the conversation is going well , propose that you should meet again . 
  if she does n't give you her number , try facebook . 
  if that does n't work , game over . 
  once you have her number , send her a message at the end of the night saying how nice it was to meet her and that you should get together sometime . 
  if she does n't reply in 1-2 days , game over . 
  during that week , invent some program for you to be together . 
  go out for a coffee ( tomar um caf\u00e9 ) is the standard , but you 'll get bonus points for originality . 
  if you 're foreign , saying `` show me your city '' works wonders here ( `` oh , i 've neve been to jer\u00f3nimos !, 
  but i 'd love to go with you if you 'd show me around '' ) . 
  if you ca n't schedule anything at all during any day of the work week , probably game over . 
  keep sending messages during the week . 
  facebook works quite well , too . 
  do n't be pushy , because if you are , game over . 
  the weekend is coming !, 
  ok , start steering those messages towards a friday night date . 
  if the mid week date went well , now is the time to invite her out to dinner !, 
  if you suceed in taking her out to dinner , things are looking well . 
  during this night you should try to kiss her . 
  i do n't have any specific pointers here , except this : if , after dinner , she proposes to meet with her friends who are at another bar/restaurant do your best to kiss her before this happens ( perhaps propose another bar that you 've been meaning to see ) , otherwise you 'll never have a chance . 
  propose that you should go to your house . 
  if she says no ( very likely ) , it 's not game over , but you 're not getting laid tonight . 
  repeat steps 7-11 until she agrees to go to your house or invites you to hers . 
  should take about 2-3 weeks . 
    welcome to the champions league !, 
  because portuguese wine is better , 
  so according to the guardian serving halal meat to everyone should not be an issue but serving pork is . 
  because it might offend other people ? 
  because it 's proselytizing ? 
  because it sets a bad example ? 
  because it 's an utter lack of respect for history of the country that graciously hosted you . 
  what rape crimes ? 
  we have lots of music festivals during the summer and no rapes . 
  how was it like in sweden ? 
  we do n't really have time to be embarrassed , my sister for example likes to spend the summer going to music festivals and not getting raped . 
  how many of them have been chopping heads , shooting hundreds in concerts , bombing innocent people , mass rapes , trying to sabotage secularism ... 
  why ? 
   trump it 's a public school in spain . 
   le pen it 's a public school in spain . 
   beer , sausages , sauerkraut . . what 's wrong with german food ? 
  apparently it has electromagnetic properties that make all the wehrmacht issued compasses start pointing to poland . 
  we will provide arctic warfare units . 
  it will probably be organized by the italian , manned by the french and fed by the german . 
   we have to deal with the migrants and refugees , we ca n't sweep them under the rug and expect everything to continue as before . 
  yes we can , just send them back . 
  i for one am not , am not willing to accept migration as * fait accompli * . 
  that 's funny considering how many times , in different parts of europe , people think i 'm speaking russian or polish ... 
  obviously it is offensive to other people . 
  `` look at me , i 'm a devout muslim and i cover my head . 
  any women who does n't is a whore . '', 
  how about we let every religious nutcase wear whatever they like in public ? 
  that would be great . 
  since i am an atheist how about i start wearing t-shirts saying `` there is no god and and even is there was one , muhammad is not her prophet '' . 
  so muslim women should be compared to nuns ? 
  freedom ** from ** religion before freedom ** of ** religion , that 's how laicism works . 
  americans do n't seem to understand this . 
  they should go with pig snouts instead of clowns nose . 
  the uk has a large trade deficit with both germany and france , so who is going to lose more ? 
   because we - and especially your country - are very much responsible of the clusterfuck going on their countries . 
   colonies and proxy wars .
