  and you seem to think this will be some kind of standoff to see who dies first . 
  the uk can not be removed but fines can be applied and right can be removed , which no one wants . 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  freedom of movement ** is ** part of single market . 
  you do n't take it out and keep calling it single market . 
  i am dumbfounded how do so many people still do n't understand that . 
  the only thing you can negotiate is either you have single market or fta ( anything else would n't be optimal ) . 
  if you do n't want freedom of movement then you get fta and you negotiate the conditions and regulations of the fta . 
  you do n't negotiate the single market , that 's not a thing . 
  also , if you think the eu , or better , the uk is going to wait much longer once may is in power i think you are very mistaken . 
  uncertainty is killing all the markets , this can not keep going for much longer , on any side . 
  the economic interest would be to have a free trade agreement at least , not just for the eu but for the uk as well . 
  single market will ** always ** come with freedom of movement , fta does n't . 
  the uk is n't some sort of economic superpower that can deal all the cards , everyone would have something to lose . 
  you say the uk can just buy from somewhere else . 
  the uk does n't even have negotiators , how many years do you think it would take to negotiate with every new potential partner ? 
  how much do you think you would pay on tariffs and transportation alone ? 
  you sound as if the uk can stop trading with the eu at any moment notice . 
  you do realize that if you spend $ 420b buying from the eu you will spend a lot more buying from somewhere else if you do n't get a fta ( not even going into the single market because that does n't seem likely to happen ) ? 
  you do realize that with may in power you will have increase in taxes right to make up for this right ? 
  do you actually believe that the uk alone , with no fta , has more trade power and negotiation power than that the whole eu and schengen members ? 
  why do people assume that diveraity is only about race ? 
  is there no diversity within races ? 
  also , diversity does n't have to mean the country as a whole , it applies to groups of all sizes, 
  see we have a diverse opinion and yet we were able to talk about it :d i 'm studying cardiovascular development , more precisely what mechanisms make the heart beat for the first time . 
  yourself ? 
   they can , but this still does n't address your original point in your first comment that diversity is a good thing in a group . 
  it does n't , but in my second post i also admitted that diversity is not good in all situations . 
   diversity of education and scientific focus is great , but is not at all the same thing as diversity of culture . 
  the thing is , education and science is part of culture . 
  culture as a whole is more than traditions and religion , is values of a society . 
  if a society values science , that 's part of it 's culture . 
  and i think many people fall into a fallacy that just because someone can from a certain country that it 's going to share 100 % of the cultural views of that country . 
  i think very few people accept every single cultural value of their country . 
  i 'm from portugal , largely a religious country , had religious education , went to sunday school until i was 13 , used to go to church ... nowadays i 'm full atheist , do n't even like taking part in religious rituals ( i came very close to not sit in the church in my sister 's wedding ) . 
  anyway , my point is that diversity in a group is beneficial in the long run , but not necessarily in the short term . 
  for example , you could say that a diverse group is more willing to do business in more different countries . 
  again , do take this with a pinch of salt as this is more me reflecting on it than anything else . 
  in the end a more diverse group makes it more open to interact with another group , that 's what i think at least . 
  i think you are putting words in my mouth which are not there . 
  yes you do n't have to be physically present to know about it but personal interaction helps with bonding . 
  about the science . 
  i never said that different races are better at specific points of science . 
  in fact i do n't even like this word because there are n't enough genetic differences for there to be races , it 's more of a social construct . 
  i would say though that different countries have different priorities in terms of science and can focus on different fields . 
  this will make it so that your education will be slightly bias towards specific approaches . 
  same with resources available . 
  countries that have less money for science will usually design different strategies to approach a broader problem . 
  i think your point is more in less in line with a reply i just posted to another user . 
  i wish we could just all get along and try to see beyond the immediate pre-conceived perceptions and care more about what people have to see and care more to exchange ideas and help each other grow and be more knowledgeable . 
  in terms of biology , variation is necessary for evolution to occur . 
  if variation does not occur species are at higher risk of extinction . 
  this relates to genes . 
  in humans we have a a very high cultural component , so memes . 
  the same principal applies for cultural evolution as it does for biological evolution , without variation and adaptation more cultures are likely to go extinct . 
  now you ca n't have very high variation because you are correct that undermines cooperation . 
  in the terms of genes , genetically similar individuals are more likely to cooperate ( look at bees and ants for example ) , and this is how we think altruism evolved . 
  like before the same can be applied to the memes . 
  people with the same cultural background and same values are more likely too cooperate than very diverse groups . 
  more cooperative groups are more likely to be successful than groups that do n't cooperate ( in social species ) because more individuals have the opportunity to thrive . 
  so now we have a conundrum , lack of diversity can lead to extinction of ideas and cultures because they fail to evolve , but lack of cooperation can lead to the same result due to only a small number of individuals overpowering the rest and due to extreme competition . 
  from this perspective , a successful strategy in the long run would be one with a balanced diversity as in , enough variation for it to evolve , but enough similarities for people to collaborate and for the population to grow as whole . 
  of course this does n't apply to all the situations , and take it with a pinch of salt . 
  my problem with many social studies ( yes , we scientist are a bit biased when criticising sociology ) is that it focus on a small scale and very specific situations . 
  i would agree that diversity when first introduced in a population can undermine cooperation and probably lead to some degree of competition ( especially against the newly introduced individual ) , however in the long run is necessary for adapting to an ever changing society . 
  an example where diversity is important is in science . 
  many labs now a days are more and more diverse ( the one i work in has 6 different nationalities ) and this allow for exchange of different ideas and come up with new strategies to solve problems . 
  in this scenario cooperation emerges due to a common interest and because abstract and imagination is necessary to push the fields forward . 
  in professions where such thinking is not necessary and that efficiency and where sticking to the same routine over and over is necessary , diversity is probably more difficult to set itself because competing ideas are often undesired . 
  i ca n't really give sources , this is mostly from what i gathered from the years i have been studying and from what i see from societies . 
  edit : forgot a few words, 
  actually diversity is a good thing in many cases . 
  not 100 % diversity , but a balance . 
  if you do n't have a diverse group you do n't develop new ways of thinking, 
  neurons in the brain have to die so others can make connections . 
  just saying, 
  of course the conservaties are happy with may as a leader . 
  i have friends that voted labour and at this point they would rather have may then anyone else available . 
  may is on the authoritarian spectrum , i.e. , losing some social freedoms is acceptable if it means reaching a certain goal . 
  i understand the principle , i just think that expressing your opinion should not have consequences for the mps and should never be enforced ( peer pressure if you want ) . 
  that too me does n't strike as very democratic . 
  i know this is not only in the uk though , in portugal the parties also have `` vote suggestion '' , and sometimes that is really not much of a suggestion . 
  that may sound good but that would only really work in theory if the parties were a group of people with no divergence in their ideals . 
  are cameron 's political ideals the same as may 's . 
  would everyone that voted for the tories with cameron as leader vote for the tories as well with may as a leader ? 
  ge would likely hurt the economy for now , and while i 'm sure an authoritarian will do something about the financial situation , i would be at least a bit concerned with your social system and minorities rights . 
  it 's very much the same in portugal , do n't take me wrong . 
  but if we are paying the mps to be there i wish it worked in a different way . 
  but this whole conversation started because there is n't always a vote , and even when there is it does n't really matter who is there , as long as is a member of the party and voting as the party wants . 
  this being the case the mps individuality does n't matter , might as well have automatic robots pressing buttons ( or raising hands , or say ay or whatever way they vote ) . 
  why have mps then ? 
  if their vote is the vote of the party then you just need one representative for each party and give them power according to how many people voted for the party . 
  for the most part . 
  do n't particularly like the tiny academic bubble i live on , almost like there is n't a world outside of it . 
  p.s : lake district was awesome, 
  but in theory not all the mp should have to agree with everything the pm decides . 
  and just because they do n't agree with one it does n't mean they would have a vote of no confidence as they could agree on many other measures . 
  well i find it more disturbing because i have been living in the uk for 4 years and have at least 1 more to go ( my original plan was to stay , still considering options ) . 
  i just think that would weaken any measures the ruling party takes , and it would create legal loopholes . 
   there is therefore no point there being an official vote in the house of commons and official votes is not what happens in uk tradition .
