  this is how i see terrorists having sex with their `` 72 virgins '' . 
  you really think the us would side with uk instead of whole europe ? 
  ok , that one was way funnier . 
  or anywhere to be honest . 
  we 're alone in this vile world . 
  yeah , that 's why i said that maybe they just need to make money somehow . 
  i do believe people that are only there as a financial option will be mentally damaged for life . 
  i actually do feel like most people who work in slaughterhouses enjoy killing animals . 
  either that or they just need to make money somehow .

  damn moors trying to take our pretty women .
