  rightly so . 
  i need this as a bed story . 
  and what is up with people saying cut penis looks better ? 
  i have an uncut penis and i can simply pull the foreskin back without a problem and it would look just like a cut penis . 
  lol, 
  invite her to portugal , that 'll change her view drastically . 
  foreigners are absolutely loved in portugal . 
  edit : it 's kinda funny she thinks portuguese people go to her country just to fuck with their women , when , in reality portuguese people mostly migrate to work . 
  she probably mistook a portuguese guy for a south american guy . 
  that 's exactly what i do . 
  just before yesterday the uv radiation was insane . 
  on my way out i had to dress up a jacket even though it was insanely hot . 
  that 's my new favorite song . 
  [ i know right .

  while northern europe tries to find ways to reduce their muslim population - portugal does it without even knowing how . 
  : ^ ) ( we know ), 
  but if portugal is spain and spain is n't a country , that makes portugal not a country as well . 
  portugal is right next to the atlantic ocean , so i doubt sharks exist near portugal . 
  : ^ ) but on a serious note : [ yes , there are . 
  but they do not come ashore . 
  they cross portuguese waters but do not get close to the coast because portugal is not a destination itself for them , rather is a passing-trough point on the way towards reproduction and hunting spots such as the mediterranean and the nordic sea .

  jesus christ ... england should bring back the infamous torture method called hanged , drawn and quartered for people like these . 
  i mean . . here in portugal it 's a loved sport by many . 
  i , myself have practiced handball for over 2 years and it was always highly contested with many new people wanting to join . 
  pass the blunt . 
  ** no shame , only pride **, 
  caught between a rock and a hard place . 
  stop producing .

  one of the reasons i love finland so much . 
  you too are a great bunch of lads . 
  so what is portugal , oh wise one !, 
  are you from the future ? 
  what happened to portugal ? 
  did spain invade us again ? 
  did we get swallowed by the ocean ? 
  quick answer me !, 
  i lol 'd . 
  germany gets 30\u00bac and portugal 18\u00bac feelsbadman, 
  i can already see the allahu snackbar . 
  at least us , poor countries ( portugal , spain , poland , etc. . . ) will be safe and sound . 
  ah , i see you are a man of culture aswell . 
  trolled . 
  you guys have finland next to you producing some really good metal , why do n't you follow their example ? 
  aww . . close one though !, 
  edit : portugal is that country next to australia , just so you know . 
  well if the european union ever collapses entirely , we 'll still have each other . 
  nah , we love our spanibros . 
  and it 'll bankrupt portugal too . 
  no , i 'm not happy . 
   : ^ ( but thanks for trying bby . 
  yeah and it has more crime in a single day than portugal in a week quite likely . 
  a bad joke . 
  hey , maybe we can replace germany with angola . 
  edit : and yes , i 'm too salty right now . 
  you triggered me by saying that you would prefer to have brazil instead of portugal in europe . 
  yeah sure . 
  instead of having the 5th safest country in the world in europe , you 'll have one of the most dangerous countries in the world but now in europe . 
  yay !, 
  i have my days . 
  this is an iberian win !, 
  caralho . . kurwa . . it 's like 2 childs of the same mother but different father . 
  yes , kurwa . 
  we actually speak spanish you imbecile !, 
  can confirm . 
  good to see that even the scottish like us . 
  brings a tear to my eye . 
  they made it up with all the times they saved us from spain so it 's all good . 
  they managed to make / r/the _ donald mad in just 1 hour . 
  you prefer us , portuguese people , am i right ... ally ? 
  i mean . . they once came to portugal to train storming beaches , guess what ? 
  they failed miserably . 
  edit : here 's the [ video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cckpgyqi-uc ) another edit : [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbvdk9tyhf8 ) is even funnier , you can see them trying to push their cars through the sand . 
  one of them even kicks the car . 
  our [ jesus ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djbqdkhbwzi/maxresdefault.jpg ) has the high ground though !, 
  that 's rude . 
  : ^ ( but yes , war . 
  not portugal , caralho * your mistake only means one thing . 
  what happened to the goold ol' days of europe where if a citizen from a neighbor country stepped a foot in your country , a war would ensue ?!, 
  they flee from portugal instead of coming to portugal : ^ ), 
  yeah , because portugal , spain and italy 's economy is great at the moment ... : ^ (, 
  i once spent 2 hours outside in the sun layed in a beach towel with my backs turned to the sun . 
  because of that i got something called `` hell 's itch '' from then on i never left to the beach without sunscreen . 
  edit : and this happened to me as a portuguese guy who 's used to hot temperatures . 
  best of luck !, 
  hopefully it all turns well for you . 
  i said that based on how portugal was doing a few years ago . 
  i was n't comparing it to other european countries whatsoever . 
  in portugal we are doing fairly well at the moment , and we 're still evolving and getting better !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_portuguese_flags portugal did it [ first !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/portugueseflag1095.svg ), 
  there are also a lot of girls here who love foreigners , especially irish . 
  even i get insanely burned here . 
  that 's why i take extra care if i 'm going to the beach . 
  you can always come to portugal . 
  do n't worry italy , we portuguese people love you .
