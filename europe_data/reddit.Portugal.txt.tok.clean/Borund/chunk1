i 'm not religious at all , but i can understand how people could be offended by this . 
  there 's someone out there whose family is buried there . 
  people go there to clean the gravestones and remember those who have passed . 
  now someone is using it as a bed or leaving trash on it . 
  i remember going to the cemetery with my grandma to visit her dead son every weekend . 
  every single weekend she would go there , wash the stone , place new flowers and spend some time praying for him . 
  the guy had been dead for over 30 years at the time . 
  she would be destroyed if she saw something like the video happening . 
  i do n't care if the people doing it are refugees , immigrants or citizens . 
  it 's disrespectful . 
  the iberian union ( 1580-1640 ) during which we were under a union with * shivers * spain . 
  i feel dirty just by thinking about it . 
  the most important thing for me ? 
  addicts got access to treatment , not only to their addiction but to diseases associated with drug use . 
  plus , by improving the sanitation of the process of using drugs , the number of new cases of hiv infections in drug addicts has severely decreased , something that has n't happened in other groups . 
  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/3f8psit.png ) you can see that hiv infections in drug addicts ( toxicodependentes ) has decreased from 766 new cases in 2003 to 131 new cases in 2011 ( the law was passed in 2001 ) . 
  on the other hand , the numbers stayed similar in hetero and homosexuals . 
  oh , my bad . 
  i thought you were referring to / r/europe because that 's what you mentioned on your first comment . 
  yeah , it does n't help , you 're right . 
  it makes it harder to accommodate the refugees . 
  but it is n't widespread enough to make a significant impact on the grand-scale of things , thankfully . 
   i do n't think we will achieve this by despicable acts like burning down a refugee center what ??? 
  i did n't mention this , it was n't being discussed , i never defended it and i spoke against it when it happened . 
  who even suggested it in / r/europe ? 
  people here are asking for legislation to control this crisis , nothing more . 
  no one expects order to be kept at all time . 
  problems are bound to happen . 
  but that 's different from the mentality many refugees have . 
  they bring false expectations and make demands they have no right to make . 
  if a guy you 're not even friendly with offered his house for you to stay for some time would you tell him `` i want to sleep in that room , not this one ; i want to be fed this and not that ; the house is to cold , turn the heater on ; you 're paying for all my expenses and i want the best stuff , not the average '' and act like an idiot if he did n't comply ? 
  for crying out loud ... 
  there 's a world of difference . 
  more ... 
  they 're bringing their conflicts with them . 
  what 's the point of kurds and turks fighting in a foreign country ? 
  what do they expect to gain from it ? 
  for now , they are ** guests ** in europe - some of them may become citizens in the future - and they should start acting accordingly . 
   germany is n't the self proclaimed leader . 
  about germany ... yeah ... 
  it has no right to push forward sanctions to the countries that do n't agree with the quotas it has proposed . 
  not when germany has been shitting on the rules like the dublin regulation . 
  there are too many refugees in germany ? 
  complain to ` mama merkel ' , since she has invited them and ignored the european legislation . 
  maybe she can try to conquer the seven kingdoms with them . 
  what do you expect , honestly ? 
  seriously ? 
  shit like this has been happening all over from greece ( because boats are taking too long ... ) to sweden ( kurds vs turks ) . 
  so , it 's not only about being crammed . 
  they 're being entitled little pricks that respect no rules and are n't thankful for what 's being given to them . 
  they 've been demanding things the 1951 refugee convention does n't grant them ( and i 've read it when it was posted here in / r/europe ) . 
  even swedes , swedes , are getting tired of their shit . 
  more , our governments have n't done a thing to solve the problem . 
  germany ( the self-proclaimed leader of europe , by they it has been acting ) , on the contrary , is just committing mistake after mistake - the government by being lenient about the refugees bypassing the dublin regulations and the common people by actually promoting it ( by picking up refugees on their personal vehicles and crossing the border with them ) . 
  hungary has been shat on in the past couple of months for being the only one actively following the rules . 
  now the rest of europe is starting to take the hint and actually trying to take action . 
  i 'm from portugal and i 'll gladly welcome every refugee that just wants a place where they can find peace and an opportunity to start their life anew . 
  the entitled pricks that demand to be treated like royalty or the ones that bring their conflicts with them ? 
  fuck them . 
  people get tired , there 's no need for brigading . 
  send money and food , please . 
  many hungries . 
  that 's kind of dumb . 
  imagine there 's a guy who falls in love with a girl , but he 's shy and ca n't make a move . 
  everyday he finds himself watching her because that 's typical when someone 's in love . 
  the guy just feels happy while he 's watching her , without sexualizing her . 
  i understand if the girl feels uncomfortable with that , i understand if she finds it creepy and i understand if she would like him to stop it . 
  but calling it sexual harassement is dumb and in no way reasonable . 
  and my opinion would be the same if the genders were reversed . 
  i honestly ca n't believe this kind of crap journalism is actually creeping out of blogs and pretend newspapers and into actual newspapers . 
  i disagree with the argument `` if he has a smartphone he is n't a refugee '' , because people who used to be well-off before the war run away too . 
  but this kind of crap journalism is just unbelievably ridiculous ...  you do n't need to be a white westerner to own a relatively cheap piece of technology [ no ] ( http://www.panarabiaenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/11/arab-man-phone.jpg ) [ shit ] ( http://www.futurewavetechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commuters-on-smartphones-008.jpg ) , [ sherlock ] ( http://gdb.voanews.com/8d5961bb-0877-48a1-b571-a4b5dd2f63f5_mw1024_s_n.jpg ) ... you 're the only one saying it . 
  that 's what i thought too , but the way it 's written leaves room for interpretation . 
   article 31  ** refugees unlawfully in the country of refugee **  1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  the contracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country . 
  the contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country . 
  serious doubt : does germany saying that it will accept any refugees count as obtaining `` admission into other country '' ? 
  if the answer is yes , then hungary is in the wrong . 
  if the answer is no , then people have been giving hungary a bad time for following the rules again . 
  [ that does n't stop your government from trying to associate your country with the ancient kingdom . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/27/macedonia-alexander-great-greece-discord ), 
   writing in the observer , the archbishop said he and the heads of other christian , jewish , muslim and sikh groups believed the bill went beyond `` merely legitimizing suicide to actively supporting it '' . 
  right . 
  ** or ** it may make psychiatric help available to people that otherwise would n't get it and would up killing themselves anyway , because no ethical health professional would participate in assisted suicide without a proper psychiatric evaluation . 
  so , as long as you legalize it properly and do n't make it profitable , this measure would probably end up saving more lives than killing . 
  fair enough . 
  thanks !, 
  you make some good points , but i find it hard to believe that girls go searching for glory . 
  they know from the start that they 'll have a secondary role on society . 
  unless they find glory in raising the next wave of extremists . 
  thank you !, 
  could someone more knowledgeable than me on this subject explain why these girls and women are eager to join a group that treats them like subhuman things ? 
  because i just ca n't understand it . 
  are they lied to about what expects them there ? 
  europe 's borders were established by centuries of conflicts , where cultural and religious differences participated . 
  because of that , european countries are now sufficiently homogeneous within themselves to avoid internal conflict . 
  middle east , on the other hand , is not . 
  different people , with different cultures and religions bundled up together by foreigners with total disregard of said disparities . 
  conflict was pretty much unavoidable .
