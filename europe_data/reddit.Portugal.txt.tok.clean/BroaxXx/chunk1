no , but i do admit i did n't phrase it well ... let me first define three words as ** i ** view them so it 's easier to for you to know what i was trying to say . 
  it 's like my personal syllabus : 1 . 
  * normal muslims : * the kind of mulsims you probably know . 
  maybe even have in your job/school/neighborhood . 
  they are pretty much westernized ignoring whatever it is that you do with your life , while still trying to follow muslim traditions . 
  * fundamentalist muslims : * muslims who are ** not ** terrorists but do believe crazy shit like homosexuality being an abnormal condition that should be forbidden , that women should n't be allowed to show their faces or hold a job , etc. 
  * extremist muslims : * the ones who blow themselves up . 
  * public opinion : * in this context when i referred to the `` public '' i was talking about the average person who does n't either feel strongly in favor or against mulsims in general . 
  i was n't talking about ( a ) idiots that believe there should be no muslims in europe * ever * and ( b ) idiots that believe that anyone should come to europe and do whatever they want and that it 's up to the europeans to accommodate them no matter what , as these people have their mind already set and wo n't change whatever you tell them . 
  i 'm referring to people who have n't thought a lot about it and do n't feel strongly either way . 
  so what i was trying to say on my previous comment ( and failed ) was that the goal of this interview is trying to turn the public opinion ( as defined above ) against fundamentalist muslims ( as defined above ) . 
  a lot of the public might not even realize some of the crazy shit some of these guys say and want and might try to defend them against prejudice . 
  this kind of interview is a platform for batshit crazy people show their true colors as a cautionary tale . 
  hope this is a better explanation . 
   fuck you . 
  that piece of shit does not deserve any attention . 
  actually i disagree . 
  specially in the context of a face-veil ban being considered letting her spew this kind of bullshit will turn the public opinion against muslim extremists . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that in cases like this the fish is caught by its mouth , the more crazy people like her talk the less support they get so giving them some air time might actually be a good thing ... 
  if mercedes thinks it 's * worth it * then they 'll use their patents . 
  it 's up to each company to assess if this is a path worth pursuing . 
  not only he ** did ** do [ just that ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150217/06182930052/elon-musk-clarifies-that-teslas-patents-really-are-free-investor-absolutely-freaks-out.shtml ) but apparently there are already companies [ using them ] ( https://electrek.co/2015/11/10/a-number-of-companies-are-now-using-teslas-open-source-patents-and-it-has-some-interesting-implications/ ) . 
  but that seems perfectly fair as it avoids the wave of frivolous lawsuits you see , for example , with smartphones . 
  care to explain ? 
  these are amazing news . 
  this is what elon musk wanted all along hence why he made his patents ~ ~ opensource ~ ~ free to use . 
  either way competition can only move things forward and prices down !, 
  it 's really exciting actually and even if i 'm a sort of musk 's * `` fan '' * i could n't be happier with what this might mean for us as a species !, 
  this chart is irrelevant ... 
  if i have a degree on economics and am employed by mcdonald 's to flip burgers i wo n't judge my achievement as a success ... or my education as useful ( or a worthy investment ) for that matter ... 
  this is typical governmental propaganda to make us feel like everything is great ( except for spain , italy and greece who are waaay off the curve ) . 
  this chart does n't tell us if they 're underemployed , if they 're working part-time , or if they 're being underpaid . 
  as far as i know most college graduates might just emigrate to other regions where the job market is better or the government might be hiding the numbers by only counting people who are enrolled on an unemployment center . 
  some countries ( like portugal ) even managed to twist the numbers by forcing people to mandatory full-time training programs ( most of which were completely useless ) making them * technically not unemployed ( they called them `` active unemployed '' discarding them from unemployment numbers ) . 
  this kind of information is utter bullshit and only serves to make people less angry at the state of the economy ... 
  who the hell do you think you are ? 
  some kind of * expert * ? 
  unless when they * do n't * and people ( or like you put it , `` the ignorant , bench-warming masses '' ) protest and things change ( sometimes for the better , sometimes for the worse ) ... 
  there is a multitude of examples of economical decisions that were made ** without ** the people 's interest at heart some of which are allegedly present in the ttip ... 
  since i 'm starting to believe you are actually just trolling me and wasting my time with cheap rhetoric i 'm not gon na bother with replying to you . 
  if you are actually serious you can read some of the sources i 've given you in one of my previous posts or acquaint yourself with google . 
  removing voice form the masses because of the possibility that they are wrong seems awfully like a dictatorship ... maybe enough time has passed since we 've had one of those in europe that people like you are starting to forget what a dictatorship ** inevitably ** means ... 
  blindly ignoring an expert 's informed opinion is a grave mistake as it was recently proven . 
  nevertheless blindly accepting an expert 's opinion and purposelessly assuming they have your best interest at heart can be just as wrong and dangerous ... 
  the little available information that was revealed is cause for some concern and the fact that the rest of it is being withheld from the public should also raise some alarms ... 
  if you read my op you 'll notice i 'm ** not ** interested on `` fringe unsourced websites '' ( ie : anti-capitalist conspiracy theory websites ) . 
  i am actually interested in real information and points of view from qualified experts that both support and ** do n't support ** the ttip ... 
  so , by taking ** your own ** advice i should listen to experts like the [ nobel laureate joseph stiglitz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sifo5hrrjqg ) , [ the columbia university economist and united nations adviser jeffrey sachs ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-hickey/economist-jeffrey-sachs-s_b_5823918.html ) or [ the head of european union and international relations owen tudor ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2015/feb/18/guardian-live-what-is-ttip-and-how-does-it-affect-us ) who are all openly against the ttip . 
  if i ignore both sides of the argument because surely these policies have * `` my '' * best interests the i 'm blindly letting my own ignorance get the best of me ... 
  lol yeah ... 
  i was shocked but then i remembered you always check the username first ... 
   in fact , the vast majority of young people , which i assume most of us on this sub are , wanted to remain . 
  then i guess the young people really shoule 've voted ... 
  i 'm not even sorry !, 
  between the protest vote retards and the lazy assholes that stayed at home i could n't care less ... 
  it 's a sad day for europe ... : - /, 
  lol true that ... french was the * lingua franca * for that generation and it 's much more usual to find `` older '' people speaking french ... 
  but , yeah ... 
  i was too focused on `` my '' generation to realize that part of my comment does n't hold up ... 
  yeah , but after that we were still alies in ww1 , ww2 ( portugal was considered a `` non-belligerent ally '' ) and in other conflicts ... 
  specially in northern portugal ( and porto ) the english influence is easy to spot ... maybe that 's why so many portuguese are fluent in english ? 
  was n't there a vaccine for that ? 
  oh , right ... * those * people ...  :(, 
  that sounds a bit like helicopter parents saying their kids ca n't move out on their own ... 
   even if i am moving the goalposts ( i 'm not ) , why on earth is that important ? 
  it 's a logical fallacy because it prevents people from having a constructive argument where the points you make are unable to be disproved even if you are wrong and people provide proves of that fact . 
  the fact that you do n't understand what a logical fallacy is and why it 's bad even after i sent you a wikipedia article about it to you speaks volumes on your behalf ... 
   ** this does n't show anything at all . 
  ** of course population and total gdp grows when more countries are added . . 
  the premise is that the article and its conclusions are flawed because it 's missing important information to which you add :  gdp per capita for the last 10 years . 
  then / u/toreon provides the evidence that ** you ** asked for and you claim it 's not enough and proceed to move the goalpost ... 
  this proves that gdp/capita has increased in the given period validating the conclusions of the original article . 
  then you * move the goalposts * and say that ** now ** that 's not enough ... do you need a drawing to make it easier ? 
  ** edit : ** changed a bunch of my original reply as it was confusing to read ... 
  you 're defining [ moving the goalposts fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moving_the_goalposts#logical_fallacy ) ... 
  how can russia work to get a candidate elected ? 
  does france have electronic polls ? 
  if so why do n't they do it the old fashioned way ? 
  so many questions ... 
  are you fucking serious !? 
  ~ ~ what 's the shows name !? 
  are there subtitles ?!, 
  if i manage to see that i 'll get the tripiest nostalgia trip of my life !, 
  ! ~ ~ just found it !, 
  getting a nostalgia trip right now !, 
  after games without borders this is one of my fondest childhood memories !!, 
  the degree to which the electorate is uninformed makes me wonder if this was in fact a democratic election ... actually makes me wonder this for every election since i was old enough to vote . 
  there you go assuming pronouns again !, 
  yes , because france and belgium have n't had any problems yet ... not to mention that with open borders every country is at some degree of risk ... 
  he 's not threatening baltic countries but is threatening our stability and homeland security . 
  which might be considered just as bad ... that being said i 'd just like , for what it 's worth , to give a word of support ... last year in turkey seems like a nightmare and a very frightening one at that ... hope everything works out for you and your loved ones in the future . 
  a lovely nation very worthy of being considered a eu state and a wonderful addition if it goes through ... what hurts me most is that i had a couple of friends living in turkey ( they obviously got the fuck out as soon as shit hit the fan ) and it was such a promising country that the recent turn of events kinda breaks my heart ... : /, 
  that 's a no true scotsman fallacy . 
  but , either way , if you * were * right then right-wing extremists would be right as well and islam would not be compatible with our western values and society ... 
  i myself believe ( though i can not support this belief ) that most muslims do n't give two fucks about sharia law . 
  yes , that 'll get you the support of the conservative crowd !, 
  nice thinking !, 
  i bet they 're trying to pull off a popup store thing . 
  their profit margin must be so high they probably can call it a success if , after a year , they 've only sold half the stock . 
  \\* sigh \\* it 's one of those times where you do n't see a lot of portuguese people commenting .
