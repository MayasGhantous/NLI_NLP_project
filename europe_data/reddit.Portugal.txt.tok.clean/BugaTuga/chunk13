   andrea leadsom says broadcasters need to ~ ~ be patriotic . ~ ~ ** fall in line and just follow the orders dictated by their masters **, 
  it reads an awful lot like a taunt directed at democratic societies as well . 
   if you want to plug a solar panel to the grid in spain you have to register and pay a tax that usually makes solar energy impractical ( the objective of that law ) that appears to be wrong . 
  according to the el pais newspiece , the so called tax is actually levied only on the usage of energy storage devices that are connected to spain 's power grid . 
  those who install solar panels and connect their homes to the power grid do n't pay any tax , and are only required to pay a fee if they also connect an energy storage device to the power grid . 
  any homeowner who installs solar panels and energy storage devices on off-grid houses also does n't pay any tax . 
  it appears the bulk of the criticism is directed at the end of the generous subsidy program used to popularize solar power . 
  the so called tax appears to be a fee that is actually levied exclusively on energy clients who connect their own energy storage devices to the power grid . 
  the so called tax is not levied on homeowners who own solar panels , are connected to the power grid , but do n't have energy storage devices , and it is also not levied on off-grid homeowners , whether they have energy storage devices or not . 
   this land-art act was carried out as a protest against the sun tax ; an outrageous measure taken by the spanish government ( conservative pp party ) to prevent citizens from becoming independent of the big electricity companies . 
  for those who prefer unbiased reports free from populist propaganda , there 's [ the article published by el pais in 2015 over the so called `` sun tax '' ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/09/inenglish/1433860560_474648.html ) in short : * the proposal levies tax on running energy storage systems connected to the nation 's power grid * off-grid uses who generate and consume all their energy and do n't contribute energy back to the grid are exempt from paying any charge . 
  * on-grid users who generate energy but do n't have energy storage devices are also exempt from paying any charge . 
  * additionally , solar power subsidies , which were created to jump-start the trend and provided economic incentives to encourage investments in domestic solar power generation , were slashed once solar power became popular among spaniards . 
  for another unbiased report , [ here 's a somewhat outdated article published by the bbc in 2013 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-24272061 ) taken from bbc 's article :  the government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros ( # 22bn ; $ 35bn ) , which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices . 
  if on average your potential disposable income in lithuania is already around 20 % lower than in greece , that 's a hell of an advantage . 
  and i focused on income alone because let 's face it greece offers far better living conditions than any baltic state . 
   the damage done by syriza is not even remotely compared to what pasok and nd did to the country . 
  i do n't believe anyone claimed that syriza managed to pile 20 years of damage in a couple of months into their government . 
  yet , the collapse of the economy and the bank runs caused by syriza 's minister of finance , let alone the impending bankruptcy caused by a suicidal political game of chicken , did managed to considerable damage to greece and were single-handedly responsible for reverting much of the progress that greece did in the previous couple of years . 
  just because the previous guys broke an old lady 's arm it does n't mean that the followup guy has a stellar performance if the first thing he does in office is to kick the same old lady in the chins . 
  focusing on income , apparently the average income in lithuania is still way lower than greece 's ( 800 $ / month vs 1000 $ / month ) . 
  you tell me . 
  syriza , which is already a coallition of radical political parties , formed a coallition government with another radical party with far-right , fascist tendencies . 
  in a couple of months , syriza 's minister of finances managed to drive the nation into economic collapse and resigned to try to avoid putting his career ambitions in jeopardy . 
  trump is very bad , but it 's wrong to assume that syriza 's start was less of a shit show than trump 's impact on the us . 
  in fact , even syriza had russia pulling some strings . 
  political parties which succeed based on populista propaganda and all around demagoguery , such as syriza , essentially succeed by exploiting some weakness and promissing the impossible with hopes that they can fool enough voters to get them elected . 
  when the current state of affairs is really bad and this sort of tactics exceeds the demagogue 's expectations to the point that the party actually gets to form a government , they are then forced kicking and screaming back into reality and are forced to face their electorate by admitting that what all their promises are empty and impossible to put into practice . 
  dijsselbloem does n't get love because he 's awesome . 
  he happened to be president of a particular group which had to deal with a particularly irrational and self-defeating minister of finance which drove his nation into collapse in just a couple of months . 
  dijsselbloem spoke for everyone else in the group , while varoufakis went on with his particular blend of suicidal clownery . 
  just by contrast alone , whoever spoke for everyone else would naturally get all the sympathy there was to give . 
  the eu/imf/ecb troika were going out of their way to offer gigantic soft loans to greece , and the only thing that they asked in return was that they paid their soft loans back over the next 3 ou 4 decades and that greek governments actually implemented reforms that put a stop to their chronic overspending and widespread accounting fraud . 
  and let 's not forget that the eu/imf/ecb troika already pardoned around half of greece 's debt , and they did so in a way that actually led some banks to go bankrupt . 
   the financial ministers of europe are pissed with the guy that says that the program they have invested so much political capital in , has failed ? 
  iirc , the most hardline critics of varoufakis-led clownery were in fact the ministers of finance of the baltic states and the netherlands . 
  one of the criticism made by the baltic states was that syriza 's varoufakis had the gall to talk about humanitarian disasters although greece 's gdp per capita was well above estonia 's and lithuania 's , and he had the nerve to demand that states such as estonia and lithuania should simply give away massive stockpiles of money to him for greece to inflate greece 's economy back to twice their own gdp per capita , and they should give all that cash away while he refused to implement any economic and financial reform that put a stop to greece 's chronic overspending . 
  it seems that some people already forgot that other eurozone states such as germany had to actually go out of their way to convince the netherlands , finland and the baltic states to refrain from veto syriza 's bailout package in 2015 . 
  yet , somehow it 's still germany 's fault . 
   that 's what usually happens if you give a promise before you 're able to take a look in the book . 
  refusing to pay has absolutely nothing to do with accounting . 
  it 's a purely political initiative , and those who support it already admit they are aware that , in the very least , it does cause financial and economic problems in the short run . 
  yet , that 's supposed to be acceptable because supposedly in the long run it 's some sort of economic magic bullet that makes all problems go away . 
  overspending with double-digit deficits and cooking the books to hide a colossal debt caused by years of running a colossal deficit has a lot to do with it . 
  the only relation between greece 's massive accounting fraud and the euro is the fact that the euro kept interest rates low . 
  and there is the tax fraud thing . 
   yes , i hate when some people ignore the fact that conservatives ran the country into the ground , what syriza did was stabilize the ship over the last 2 years , the ship that nd nearly capsized . 
  you 've left out the fact that nowadays all syriza is doing is implementing reforms established by the eu , but when syriza took office their first minister of finance managed to run greece into the ground in record time right up to his resignation . 
  fta :  witnesses said the man , who ** shouted that she was a `` shitty bobo '' , a shortened term for a bourgeois-bohemian that is often used as an insult to the city 's wealthy middle-class professionals ** , ran off into the nearby m\u00e9tro when he saw her collapse on the ground . 
  not a hate crime , then . 
   makes you wonder , no , it does n't . 
  you 're just acting like a dick . 
  stop it . 
  you do n't need to . 
   renounce your aristocratic title , you fool . 
    then you can speak for the commoners like us . 
   vv is basically progressive conservatives with a very liberal platform . 
  wikipedia 's article refers that vetevendosje identifies itself as center-left . 
  the party also appears to have a long history of opposing any form of privatization , which does n't seem to be compatible with any concept of liberalism . 
  furthermore , apparently vetevendosje merged with quite a few marxist and socialist parties throughout the years . 
  i really doubt that those militants changed their mind regarding fundamental political principles once they 've switched the official party logo . 
   so why exactly would vetevendosje be an `` eu-critical radical '' ? 
  their goal is literally to remove corruption and strengthen kosovo 's economy . 
  what is so radical there ? 
  wikipedia 's article on vetevendosjen mentions that the party organized protests that resulted in the destruction of 28 eulex vehicles , and has been involved in quite a few violent protests and attacks directed towards ambassadors and diplomats . 
  to add insult to injury , party representatives even go as far as stating that the violent nature of their protests is justified , simply because they do n't agree with some issue . 
   i got it from literal sales costs of them in other words , you 've made them up and thus ca n't provide any actual source for the bullshit you repeatedly post on reddit . 
  yet , you complain that others state facts backed up by sources . 
   which you would know , if you even tried to look them up i did looked them up , and you 're the only source on those values . 
  admit it , you 've made them up and dedicate yourself to peddle bullshit on reddit that you 've made up . 
   kuwait paid if you were n't peddling bullshit you 've made up and actually had looked into the kuwait deal , you would be aware that kuwait actually paid italy to essentially hire the italian air force to manage kuwait 's air force for a period of 20 years , including logistics , operational support , training air crew and ground personel . 
  without the intergovernmental agreement , each eurofighter was sold for about $ 140 million . 
  http://www.thenational.ae/business/aviation/kuwait-agrees-to-buy-28-eurofighter-typhoons-in-multibillion-euro-deal that 's $ 140m vs your bullshit $ 198m unit price you 've also made up for the f35 . 
   they 're actually not , and they 're especially not when you consider maintenance and spare parts . 
    foreign military sales ( fms ) i have no idea where you came up with those numbers , and i suspect that neither do you . 
  in fact , not only you were unable to provide any source on them but also googling those numbers returns only posts on reddit by / u/lordderplythethird like [ this one you 've posted months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5kghsn/china_tests_5thgeneration_stealth_fighter_cheaper/ ) on / r/worldnews , and [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/543v9q/india_signs_deal_to_buy_36_frenchmade_rafale/ ) on / r/europe . 
  it appears that you dedicate yourself to post baseless assertions on reddit regarding prices while repeatedly failing to provide and reference or source or basis for your assertion . 
  and on top of this , you actually complain that others quote facts and figures . 
   here is wib claiming that disel subs are the way forward . 
  sweden 's gotland subs sink us carriers while remaining undetected . 
  http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/swedens-super-stealth-submarines-are-so-lethal-they-sank-us-18383 those diesel subs are so lethal that the us even leased sweden 's subs and crew to train against them to try to counter the threat . 
  it 's hard to argue against wib when the us spends millions proving them right . 
   in an actual military forum . 
  dudes posting comments on the internet . 
  ok . how authoritative . 
  meanwhile : * http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22530/pentagon-tester-f-35-combat-testing-delays/ * http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/26/politics/f-35-fighter-jet-problems-gilmore-memo/index.html * http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-f-35-14-trillion-dollar-national-disaster-19985 * http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/09/politics/f-35-grounded-oxygen-problems/index.html * https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-04/is-the-f-35-a-trillion-dollar-mistake  how about an actual military exercise where the f-35 scored 20.7-1 kda . 
  you mean the red flag propaganda fiasco ? 
  http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/7488/lets-talk-about-those-f-35-kill-ratio-reports-from-red-flag here 's another example of how the us typically uses their military exercises to pull the wool over the proverbial eyes . 
   they 're a generation behind that 's meaningless as the f35 does n't work , and apparently when it manages to run it even underperforms when compared with the f16 whose price tag is about 1/5th . 
   and next year the f-35a will be five million cheaper than the typhoon . 
  that 's speculation , at best . 
  until then , the f35 remains by far the most expensive option inthe market , and one which does n't even work . 
   to be fair the unit price of the f-35 makes pretty much everything else seem like a waste already . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the f35 is far more expensive than the eurofigher and the rafale . 
     seems like a case of `` too many cooks spoil the broth '' , with the entire operation spread out over multiple countries . 
  design issues ca n't be pinned on the production process , and after a cursory glance at wikipedia 's article it sounds like all problems associated with the nh90 ( material strength , corrosion issues , space restrictions , etc ) were design problems . 
  the nh90 also appears to be a special project aimed at jump-starting europe 's capabilities in building military helicopters . 
  meanwhile , the eurofigher project does n't appear to suffer from any problems , perhaps other than its cost .
