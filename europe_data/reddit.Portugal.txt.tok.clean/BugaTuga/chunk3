  yeah , how dare they , the mutual fund setup by all nations to provide help to ailing nations , give soft loans to nations in need of economic aid in exchange of actually solving the problems they brought onto themselves ? 
  i mean , it 's not like the imf only grants these soft loans to the nations that request them . 
  they should be severely punished for their crimes . 
  but only after they give away the cash . 
     oh france , why do you let things escalate . 
  this is not needed , uphold your authority . 
  i would put my money on the odds that these so called movements are just yet another front for anti-establishment organizations to try to milk all the anti-establishment propaganda out of these cases while using these illegal immigrants as useful idiots . 
  my guess is that germany does n't hold kind memories regarding groups of foreigners raping german women in german soil . 
   i 'm surprised more europeans have n't heard of the western sydney gang rapes . 
  the parallels are quite strong . 
  as a reference : [ wikipedia article on the sydney gang rapes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sydney_gang_rapes ) . 
   technically you 're right you 're just admitted that your nato claims are bullshit . 
  just give up and stop lying . 
  in case you 're wondering , [ here 's a pic of the polish scientist responsible for surveying the site ] ( http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/zacmbc5lmtb3wmiitavd.jpg ) . 
   it would be only for political reasons if it happens . 
  political and strategic . 
  i assume the ability to transfer train loads of cargo between finland and baltic nations without being forced to go through russia has its advantages . 
   it 's funny really , even the imf came out recently and straight up admitting they were wrong . 
  the imf admitted that they underestimated the economic effect of the proposed spending cuts , and that they were also wrong in bending the rules to offer help to countries that failed to meet the most basic requirements . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece ) it 's very strange that people like you insist in picking up the imf people stating `` we were wrong in giving away money to people who did n't meet the requirements '' and insist in twisting that type of statement saying `` see ? 
  they admit they were wrong ** in doing each and everything i did n't approved and criticized ** . 
  a tad dishonest , do n't you think ? 
   he was removed from syriza i vividly recall him [ announcing his own resignation from his syriza appointment ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/greek-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-resigns-despite-referendum-no-vote ) and while arguing that the motivating factor was the referendum supported what he defended and he somehow was reluctant to stay the course he advocated . 
  that 's varoufakis in a nutshell . 
  emphasis in nut . 
   is n't he saying that it 's hard to learn the language because swedes do n't like to talk to him ? 
  what language ? 
  swedish or english ? 
   that seems like a fair criticism if true . 
  learning a language with no one to speak to is hard as fuck . 
  it 's obviously bullshit . 
  sweden offers [ free swedish courses to any immigrant . 
  ] ( http://www.stockholm.se/forskolaskola/svenskundervisning-for-invandrare-sfi/swedish-for-immigrants-/ ), 
   ive meet plenty of engineers who lack any organisation skills for anything but their field . 
  we 're not talking about a complex systems engineering project , here . 
  we 're talking about basic stuff , such as asking himself `` i 'm moving to sweden and i want to take my family with me . 
  how 's life over there , and what will it take to get my life up and running ? '', 
  you know , the most basic stuff that anyone moving into any foreign country asks himself before venturing into the unknown . 
  most people plan their week-long trips abroad on holidays with more care than this idiot did with his life-risking adventure into the unknown . 
  what does this say about this moron ? 
  sweden has an awesome higher education system , where nael hamadi could enroll to actually improve his life . 
  but somehow he simply whines . 
  this nael hamadi character does n't sound like he is the brightest bulb in the christmas tree . 
  who in their right mind would subject himself to a notoriously dangerous and life-threatening human trafficking service to actually succeed in reaching his target destination , and then proceed to go back where he first left because he failed to inform himself about what he was doing and now complains about petty bureaucracy and being in a foreign land ? 
  in fact , is n't he supposed to be escaping a civil war ? 
  additionally , the article mentions nael hamadi has a b.a. 
  in engineering , but i seriously doubt that such an idiot , who has such a profound lack of planning skills or even critical thinking , has anything to do with engineering at all . 
  in fact , perhaps that 's why he whines about the `` seven or eight years '' he estimates it would take for him to `` start his life there '' , because it takes anyone just 5 years to get through a full-blown masters degree in engineering . 
   or just something else than sentimentalism and false arguments to try to convince people ? 
  that 's a very odd statement , because the only argument that the separatists play is nothing more than emotional and sentimental bullshit . 
  talk about wanting to have their personal independent cake and eat it too . 
   this is not a schr\u00f6dingers box . 
  it 's schr\u00f6dingers black box : the data only becomes unreadable once they realize it shows the plane did entered turkish airspace . 
   so like spanish submarines ? 
  i suppose you 're referring to spain 's [ s-80 class submarine program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-80-class_submarine ) . 
  even with the design issues ( all engineering projects experience them ) , spain managed to setup a submarine industry that is self-sufficient , and enables the spanish navy to equip itself cheaper than buying germany 's export boats . 
  additionally , it appears india is also interested in the subs , which might mean the program may end up paying for itself . 
  spain did very well for themselves . 
   it costs the same or even less ( depending on variant ) as your own typhoons . 
  if by `` the same as '' you mean `` almost twice than '' , you are right . 
  nevertheless , money spent on eurofighters is money spent on eu military and high-tech industry . 
  let 's not forget the people in charge of guine-bissau , a narcostate whose government has well established business ties with colombian drug lords . 
  they are just giving the public what they want to see . 
   theoretically speaking , portugal is also a spain . 
  those are fighting words !, 
  sometimes these loons manage to be their own parodies . 
  it 's a bit hard to play the victim when the video of the candidate being punched in the face is right there for the world to see . 
   honestly , human body is a lot more durable than you would expect . 
  spend a couple of minutes watching vids on liveleak , and you 'll understand that this is n't exactly true . 
   in my opinion this wo n't have a significant impact in election results . 
  in portugal , something similar happened in the presidential elections of 1986 . 
  communist party members assaulted the candidate supported by the socialist party when he visited the town of marinha grande , a notorious communist enclave . 
  the news about the beating ultimately lead him to surge in the polls and double his voting intentions , which lead to his election as president of portugal . 
  [ this news was already posted . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3x46e5/rajoy_spanish_pm_punched_in_the_face_during_a/ ), 
  it 's that time of day where everything is pinned on the dreaded neoliberalism bogeyman . 
  now , imagine if neoliberalism actually had anything to do with this issue . 
  again , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism your argument is simply idiotic . 
   what about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism, 
   how a guy metaphorically describes an area to a newspaper is not exactly objective fact it 's your word against his . 
  he has grenade attacks a a series of shootings to back up his statement . 
  you , on the other hand , only have hand-waiving , baseless assertions and a series of strawman arguments that fail to address the problem . 
   what , i 'm not claiming anything , i 'm stating facts . 
  there 's a goddamn police station there . 
  what are you saying , it 's run by smurfs disguised as police ? 
  you 've claimed there was police there , to which i pointed out reports that the area is described as '' [ not exactly ] the wild west , but something in that direction '' . 
   yes , a guy called amir told a magazine called the local that he feels the gang environment is something in the direction of the wild west . 
  but you 're just some random anonymous guy on the internet claiming otherwise , and the only thing that you can leverage is your baseless assertion . 
  and you 're doing this while desperately trying to lead everyone to turn a blind eye to all the reports and evidences . 
   if you 're talking about roseng\u00e5rd or similar areas , they have more of a police presence than other areas . 
  here 's what [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150622/police-concerned-over-malm-wave-of-violence ) had to say about the police presence in roseng\u00e5rd after the infamous grenade attacks and series of shootings :  `` today , the gang environment is ... i do n't want to exactly call it the wild west , but something in that direction , '' amir rostami , a leading authority on sweden 's organized crime groups told the local after two people died in a shooting in the suburb of hisingen in march . 
   not reported by the media if you read what i wrote , you 'll notice i did n't referred to `` the media '' as a whole but to this newspaper in particular . 
  the central point of the ikea murders , and the motivation for the attack , was that the attacker was an illegal immigrant being deported and consequently opted to go on a murder-suicide binge . 
  being the sole motivation behind the act is precisely the definition of relevant . 
  the ikea murders was n't islamic terrorism . 
  iirc , the attacker was an illegal immigrant scheduled for deportation , and decided to go the old murder-suicide route to avoid being sent back . 
  in fact , i believe the two victims were also immigrants . 
  does anyone find it strange that the author of the article makes a point of stating the alleged political allegiance of the attacker right in the article 's leading paragraph ? 
  in the ikea murders , it was obvious right from the start that the [ same newspaper was bending over backwards to omit any reference regarding the alleged attacker ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150813/cctv-shows-ikea-suspect-tried-to-kill-himself ) , but in this news report the same paper makes a point of associating the attacker with a very specific political allegiance .
