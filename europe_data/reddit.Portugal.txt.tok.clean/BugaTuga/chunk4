  somehow , the same level of attention regarding this sort of prejudice was n't considered . 
  that 's the point . 
  when they are in the opposition austerity is bad and must be stopped at all costs , and everyone who does it is automatically the enemy of the people . 
  then , somehow , when they find themselves at the helm , any mention of the dreaded austerity bogeyman is suddenly omitted from the discourse because they do n't do that sort of thing : they only balance the books by imposing spending cuts and tax hikes . 
  i love the way the article refers to `` deep spending cuts and tax hikes '' , but the word `` austerity '' is never mentioned anywhere . 
  if the word is never used , i guess it does n't exist and syriza 's budget does n't have any . 
  hooray to newspeak . 
   said the portuguese . 
  how many racial riots has portugal dealt with in the past decade ? 
  zero ? 
  sounds like france needs to learn a thing or two from portugal . 
   calais has nothing to do with this . 
  calais is a clear example of france 's ineptitude regarding upholding the rule of law on areas deemed `` culturally sensitive '' . 
  i mean , it 's a whole village that everyone knows its there , inhabited by illegal immigrants from unknown origins who spawned a long series of criminal problems . 
  then , in spite of everyone acknowledging its existence , french authorities are still unable and unwilling to fix their problem or do anything regarding this mess . 
  and the same inept authorities now decide to lambast belgium for this mess ? 
  france should get their shit together and lead by example , not whine in retreat and cover up their ineptitude . 
   two nations like belgium and france throwing ` pot-shots ' at each other in general is extremely unseemly in my opinion . 
  it 's unseemly to be lambasted as the sole responsible for an attack when the failures of france regarding their own extremists and lawlessness are widely known and even acknowledged by french officials . 
  the calais comment is spot on , as is the comment regarding france 's notorious lawless ghetto problem . 
  i mean , how many racial riots has france dealt with during the past decade ? 
  bitching about belgium is just a thinly veiled attempt to divert attentions from the real problem , and the french regime would be better off if it actually did its job instead of wasting its time pulling fruitless propaganda stunts . 
   there are several legit articles one by new york times which breaks down the connections between the attackers and where they came from you are either playing dumb or you still did n't understood the point . 
  the attackers were european . 
  plain and simple . 
  it does n't matter if they went to syria or burkina faso , because the schengen agreement guarantees the right to free movement within european states . 
  once they entered greece , as european nationals , they are subjected to less checks than any refugee or migrant , because they would be subjected to ** zero ** checks . 
  as european citizens , they can go from one point of the eu to the other without even pulling out the id card . 
  are you capable of understanding this ? 
     he organized the attacks - including bringing in attackers from syria . 
  i suggest you inform yourself of the ordeal , because the bulk , if not all , of the attackers who have been positively identified were all french or belgian nationals . 
  in spite of the rumors that one or two bombers were syrian refugees , it appears that they used false identities with hopes of triggering an angry reaction by useful idiots . 
  if you want to discuss things , in the very least do n't be an idiot and try to learn the very basics of the issue . 
  i recommend you start by reading the [ wikipedia article on the november 2015 attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks#perpetrators ) . 
  but then again , if you were n't an idiot you would n't have started your reply with petty insults and personal attacks . 
   he found a hole and exploited it . 
  he was a belgian national . 
  any issue regarding border checks is entirely irrelevant . 
  that moment when you realize the guys from manowar are already in their 60s . 
   because it was not a genocide . 
  [ a lot of people do disagree . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor_genocide_question ), 
   where a journalist walter duranty here 's the [ wikipedia article on walter durantly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walter_duranty ) . 
  nasty character . 
   the moment you realize that the houses ( on the inside at least ) build for the refugees are way better than yours . 
  but your home has the advantage of not being located in penela . 
  we 're a he !, 
  considering how past governments kept screwing the nation , surely it is a she by now . 
  hollande only gets on a scooter when he needs to fulfill his booty call responsibilities . 
  so french . 
     that 's a great picture though , i 'm not a fan of the guy but damn , must feel lonely being there . 
  actors never feel lonely when they are on stage . 
   sounds dumb , but in all honesty they probably did n't know . 
  perhaps it 's just a way to de-escalate the crisis . 
  russia got bit in a humiliating way ( a f16 easily wipes out a russian plane , and on top of that the rescue mission got their ass handed to them as well ) and may believe it needs to retaliate for propaganda and posturing purposes to try to save face . 
  by claiming that they did n't knew they were shooting at a russian plane , and suggesting that if they did they would n't have done it , they open a door for that de-escalation . 
   you can perfectly use tactical nuclear bombs in a regular conflict except you ca n't , as that legitimizes the use of nuclear weapons by the other side , which is nato , and the mutual assured destruction thing rears its head in an ugly way . 
  that 's a weapon that 's only used when they realize they 've lost the war . 
   4 km inside of syria ? 
  it takes between 15 and 30 seconds for the su-24 to cover that distance . 
  the duration of the crash video alone is longer than that . 
   and then we wont see turkey ever again turkey is listed in the top 10 in the world military rating , and has nearly as much active military personnel as russia . 
  then there 's the nato thing . 
   15 km for the speed of a fighter jet is very little so little that you are unable to turn and avoid going somewhere you already knew you could n't be ? 
  turkey is playing the same game , but it calls russia 's bluffs in a whole different level . 
   when france can expect more support from putin then other eu members . 
  let 's not pretend that putin is n't trying to milk every ounce of political and diplomatic goodwill out of this mess . 
  particularly involving france , a nation that was forced to backtrack on the mistral deal due to political pressure . 
  this is exactly the same card that putin played on syriza 's leadership in their anti-eu phase . 
   why did you vote be then ? 
  the `` useful vote '' concept applies to people other than mainstream moderate parties . 
  in fact , voting for small parties that are believed to have no chance in influencing the way the nation is governed is a well established and popular form of protest vote . 
   psd did the exact same thing in the last elections . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the former prime-minister , jos\u00e9 socrates , resigned right after he negotiated his bailout deal , and barely participated in the election campaign . 
  he wanted from the very start to be far far away from portugal once the bailout program started . 
  portugal clearly did n't wanted none of that . 
  the coalition representing the previous government won the elections , and the runner-up party is supposed to be everything syriza is n't . 
  both parties control over 80 % of parliament . 
  but then the leader of the runner-up party decided to force his way into forming a government , against bitter criticism from within his own party , and instead opted to get support from radical far-left parties . 
  so , i hope the imf/eu/bce troika representatievs enjoy having holidays in the sun because in 2 or 3 years from now they will have to come back to portugal . 
  i remember how syriza inherited an economy free from bank runs and whose economy was n't tanking . 
  i also remember syriza saying stuff about the virtues of democracy , and then called for a referendum where greeks stated one thing and syriza proceeded to do the exact opposite . 
   eh , he 's not as crazy as people make him out to be . 
  he 's just very left you 're talking about the `` i 'll just energize the system with my magic laptop '' guy , are n't you ? 
  the same one who 's charging 20k for each public appearance ? 
   correct , the police did not turn up for the deadline which was roughly one hour ago . 
  sadly , sweden is becoming a sad parody of itself . 
  truth be told , it appears the property owner also fucked up immensely . 
  from the article :  the case of the camp in malm\u00f6 is unique because ** the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants ( ... ) for six months ** before launching a trespassing case with police . 
  the only thing that yanis varoufakis sets up is his place in front of the nearest spotlight . 
   exactly , he 's taking advantage of others good will . 
  [ not exactly good will ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot ), 
   which is exactly what you have been campaigning for , maybe a dictatorship is n't what you were after ? 
  you see , he only campaigns for a dictatorship where he gets to be the one calling the shots and bossing everyone around . 
  if he is n't the dictator , everything is unfair . 
  this belief , somehow , is shared by all proponents of their own blend of totalitarian regime : if they do n't get to play the role of the dictator , somehow everything is suddenly highly unacceptable . 
  from the blog :  during these past days , portugal has been the victim of a silent coup organized by the country 's pro-european leaders [ 1 ] . 
  ffs ... who let these cooks out of their mental institution ? 
  that 's precisely the case portugal is right now .
