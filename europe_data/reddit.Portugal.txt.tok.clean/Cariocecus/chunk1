it was mainly a protest/troll vote . 
  tv votes do n't count for shit , if the portuguese still loved the old regime so much , [ these guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_renovator_party ) would be in the parliament a long time ago . 
  not many european countries have a support for far-right parties as low as 0.31 %, 
  portuguese do n't view the dictatorship in a positive light ( we had a revolution to get rid of it ) . 
  also , gay marriage is legal in portugal , so that map might be a bit out of date . 
  not saying that legal gay marriage = no homophobia , but it 's a good indicator that the data used might be old . 
   are some of who eat the most meat , very salted overall food , and drink the most out of the coutries west of poland . 
  we grill a lot of meat . 
  also , we tend to have a higher percentage of people who drink wine during a meal ( as compared to binge drinking vodka during the weekend ) . 
  not saying that some people do n't drink a lot when they go out , but on average the quantity is much lower than in northern and eastern european countries . 
  because it has never happened on a right leaning one , ever . 
  both the constitution and a lot of laws were remade after 1974 . 
  so in a way , portugal was pretty modern laws . 
  the blasphemy laws in a lot of european countries are probably just hanging around for centuries without anyone bothering to take them out . 
  just googled the [ guy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/dieudo.jpg/449px-dieudo.jpg ) :  initially an anti-racist activist , he later became close to the far-right front national [ 1 ] and fringe organisations . 
  ironically , it used to be the other way around before it was legalized : portuguese going to spain for abortions . 
  since the kingdoms that existed were not unified , was it still considered spain ? 
  interesting . 
  thanks . 
  source ? 
  maybe because it 's easier to find results from studies funded by the european union ? 
   the bars are as full of smoke as they have been before the first time they banned it . 
  i do n't know where are you from , but if you 're from lisbon , that 's an outright lie . 
  too hot in the centre . 
  we probably had , in the years immediately after 1974 . 
  you 're funny . 
  a lot of those countries have mandatory highschool . 
  also , a great percentage of the portuguese population lived before 1974 , most young people finish highschool these days . 
  however , i 'd rather have those statistics and actually teach kids something , than have it made easier just to boost the statistics . 
  i think that depends on the university from which you came , and the polish university to where you 'll go . 
  your area of studies is also important . 
  it is considered easy among the portuguese students i 've talked to . 
  but like i said , that depends on the attitude of the professors . 
  some do n't care and make it easier on the erasmus students . 
  so the ones that i 've talked to might have been lucky . 
  maybe you should ask the students from your university who have been there . 
  ask them how it compares with your university . 
  good luck . 
  actually , the people i know that choose poland as an erasmus destination , did so because it 's considered easy . 
  it 's not always the brightest who go on erasmus , some are there just for partying . 
  some professors do n't care and pass them anyway , because they are erasmus students . 
  and the cycle continues . 
  portugal has a huge amount of unemployed college graduates . 
  and before you start , it 's not just history graduates , engineers and business school graduates too . 
  i have friends with these types of degrees from good universities who were offered jobs bellow minimum wage ( in their areas ) . 
  also , without an international standard test , you can not say how educated people are . 
  some countries might have a more strict education system than others . 
  according to the internet , it 's [ straya ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/straya ) . 
  [ however , some are stopped to save fuel . 
  sure . 
  rephrasing : `` if you have n't got a grandparent ( dead or alive ) whose meals used to be 1/3 or 1/4 of a sardine with a bit of bread , you 're not portuguese . '', 
  true . 
  if you have n't got a grandparent that tells you that a meal was 1/3 or 1/4 of a sardine with a bit of bread , you 're not portuguese . 
  to make spain cry ? 
  the bbq ... that 's really dark . 
  interesting . 
  the lady in the video is the same that just got her barn burned down . 
  if you do n't believe that there is racism from europeans towards other europeans ( especially eastern europeans ) , then you live on fantasy land . 
  according to this link ( in portuguese ) , it was reduced to half . 
  you mean the right wing millionaire that wants to censor the press and makes racist/sexist comments all the time ? 
  i wonder why ... 
  they tried multiple times . 
  probably learned the lesson by now . 
   found no evidence of `` brigading '' or `` raiding '' really ? 
  how about this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/ if they are trying to convert people onto their side , they do n't go into a rant full of racist slurs ( like they do in stormfrom or / pol / ) . 
  they just appeal to the fear that people have for their `` security '' . 
  the leader of the most racist party in portugal ( pnr ) never starts talking like the people in / pol / . 
  he states very calmly that they are `` concerned for the security of the portuguese people '' , while some of their members have been suspects in murder cases and arrested for possession of illegal firearms . 
  i am not saying that everyone that disagrees with me is a racist ( i have n't even have a strong opinion on this matter ) . 
  but disregarding the possibility that extreme right-wing members are using this crisis as a propaganda stunt is plain naive . 
  edit : for example , as soon as i stop writing this comment , i get a lovely ( and totally not racist ) reply from a user of / r/european / r/whiterights / r/darkenlightenment etc. 
  : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qxu3h/swedes_are_so_obsessed_with_appearing_decent_and/cwjcu4o, 
  there were always a few racists here and there , but that 's normal on the internet , just ignore and move on . 
  however , lately the ratio has become far too high to be normal . 
  there was definitely some influx from r/european or stormfront . 
  / r/europe became very racist when the refugee crisis began . 
  was there a stromfront raid ? 
  they could make esperanto the standard , just to spite both english and french . 
  win win . 
  [ there is some unexplained pain and sadness on this face . 
  who hurt you misha ? 
  never seen a girl wearing a burqa . 
  is n't it only married women ? 
  the countries on the top of the list are nordic . 
  so , no . 
  everywhere . 
  putas e vinho verde is a way of life . 
  when compared with american news , yes they 're fairer . 
  but they 're not completely unbiased . 
  all the monarchies still in power around the world would beg to differ . 
  italy then ? 
  it was one of the best . 
  i 'm just saying that they are not that good looking . 
  siesta is a spanish thing , not portuguese . 
  you could at least get the stereotypes right . 
  is n't it supposed to suck ? 
  [ two years ago . 
  i 've never tried with that , so i 'll take your word for it . 
  read my post . 
  i find the combination of ** fried ** fish with ** fried ** potatoes to be stange .
