  portugal colonized inland brazil during the union with spain from 1580 to 1650 . 
  after the separation , spain agreed to let portugal keep it . 
  there were some other exchanges of territory like ceuta which wanted to remain as part of spain . 
  i imagine it 's not about trust , rather it 's about the fact that they control the bosphorus . 
  we had a lot more wars than just those two . 
  my country has communists in its ruling coalition and no party that is more right than center right . 
  we and spain are the only european nations without right wing populist growth . 
  just please try and explain to me why we should n't improve our own situation before helping people from the third world . 
  see , in my mind family comes first , local community second , countrymen third and i 've yet to be persuaded on why this is such an awful mentality . 
  by all means just accuse me of thought crimes some more , it 's a very good avenue to try and get me to change my mind . 
  i 'll worry about taking in immigrants from the third world once my countrymen are enjoying a similar lifestyle to the germans . 
  until then , i 'd rather my government spends its money on its own people . 
  you 're our biggest trade partner and we share a lot of traits as far as countries go . 
  we 're doomed to have the same history . 
  weirdly most middle eastern countries call oranges as ` portukali ' or some variation of such . 
  maybe they 're protesting us as well ? 
   what about ceuta and melilla ? 
  they 're also both colonial spoils and should be handed over to the moroccans who also dispute that it 's their territory . 
  morocco as a state did n't exist when those were conquered . 
  ceuta was n't even conquered by the spanish . 
  why ? 
  eu law states that any eu state must treat an eu citizen from another nation as if they were a citizen of that state . 
  as far as i 'm aware anyway . 
  this is solely presumption on my part . 
  anything east of maybe the czech republic is nebulous at best for portuguese people . 
  ukraine stands out a little because of immigrants . 
  realistically we recognize the ukrainian part because we have a lot of immigrants from there . 
  our military is a mess that 's paying for too many generals that do n't do anything . 
  the same money spent on a eu level might actually do something . 
   from my experience with you guys , if i am ever lost or something , some portuguese will help me and probably try to get me to come for supper as well . 
  i mean . 
  what are we supposed to do ? 
  let you starve or something ? 
  ... why ? 
  you guys do n't have feijoada ? 
  but will there be shadow play ? 
   perejil issue for instance , with member states such as portugal ( ... ) openly supporting morocco on the issue . 
  it 's almost like spain has a habit of wanting to claim portuguese islands . 
  reap what you sow in this case . 
  we just want some friends man . 
  after england we 're the most isolated country in europe . 
  spain also has exceptions for the philippines and portugal . 
   out of curiosity , is there any group in portugal that still defend the dictatorship period ? 
  inland farmers tend to say that life was better under salazar but overall it 's not defended much at all . 
  he died before the revolution actually . 
   i do n't think it 's anything to do with feeling ` too important ' , but we 've had a very different history from the rest of continental europe . 
  no you have n't . 
  portuguese history is very similar to yours . 
  the big difference is we ended up in a fascist dictatorship . 
  your media makes this ` hate ' out to be a lot bigger than it actually is . 
  ultimately , we do n't care . 
  never . 
  we 're making new ones in switzerland and luxembourg . 
  a country after my own heart . 
  look up [ costa nova ] ( https://www.visitportugal.com/sites/www.visitportugal.com/files/styles/destinos_galeria/public/mediateca/cto_ilhavo_costanova_660x371_2.jpg?itok=zmr-1p2g ) in aveiro . 
  you wo n't feel that lonely , i see dutch tourists all the time . 
   i 'll have to start an alentejano independence movement that would require you to stop lying in the shade though . 
  praia da barra and gafanha da nazar\u00e9 get flooded every year . 
  usually not seriously flooded but they still do . 
  portuguese venice might as well be called the portuguese netherlands as well . 
  it 's downhill from everywhere else , it 's flat , windy as fuck , the rain runs perpendicular to the ground and it floods easily . 
  your most ( in ) famous politician has quite the haircut himself . 
   their home country can fuck us up . 
  i 'm not at all sure that we can fuck up france at all . 
  if anything , we have a reputation for building things in france . 
   living in one of the least populated countries of europe surely you mean ` least densely populated ' . 
  spain is still the 5th or so most populous country in the eu . 
  yeah . 
  they discovered the river on the 1st of january . 
  ours lasted around 500 years though . 
  do thermometers go that low ? 
  wait what , there 's a new season of inspector max ? 
  they 're pretty good pineapples too . 
   the ban of pork meat would cause real mayhem it 'd last all of 2 hours and we 'd both need reelections to replace all the politicians that decided they could fly out of windows . 
  ceuta has been spanish for 370 years now and was portuguese for another 300 before that . 
  i did n't know you could get stockholm syndrome from food . 
  he 's saying that if you smell smoke , you should think fire and not smoke machine . 
  ca n't say i 've seen this in portugal to be honest with you . 
  wait , are we southern now ? 
  i 'm never sure about these things . 
  from the linked article :  `` perpetual mistakes by extremists , either by cold-blooded killers or uncivilised expressionists , can not be the way forward for a civilised society . 
  the peace-loving majority of people must become vociferous in promoting global civility and responsible debate . 
  at this time of heightened tension and emotion , it is crucial that both sides show restraint to prevent further incidents of this nature occurring . '' perhaps i should trim the fat and highlight things properly . 
   `` perpetual *** mistakes *** by extremists ( ... ) can not be the way forward for a civilised society . 
  ( ... ) at this time of heightened tension and emotion , it is crucial that *** both sides *** show restraint *** to prevent *** ( ... ) *** incidents *** of this nature occurring . '' slaughtering cartoonists and publishers is a `` mistake '' by extremists ? 
  no , it 's not a fucking mistake . 
  it 's murder and butchery , they 're butchers and killers . 
  both sides should show restraint ? 
  so one side should not publish cartoons of the holy , child-rapist , warlord , slaver cow of the other side and in turn that other side will not slaughter the first . 
  what an equivalence uh ? 
  publishing cartoons and slaughtering people is just about the same . 
  the article goes on :  `` the actions of the uk media in not publishing the cartoons is highly appreciated by british muslims and we hope that this kind of self-restraint and mutual respect will ultimately lead to a harmonious society . '' or if you prefer : `` do n't mock our sacred , child-raping , warlord , slaver cow and we wo n't slaughter your cartoonists . '', 
   that they are free to protest on the basis they disagree with what charlie hebdo has published . 
  they are but the point that was brought up by previous posters was defending / justifying slaughter . 
  i wonder if portuguese immigrants live in ghettos in switzerland , luxembourg and france . 
  something tells me some cultures are more compatible and more willing to coexist than others . 
  the portuguese one will undoubtedly be positive towards the english . 
   they must be floating with their towels on the ocean i still do n't understand this towel thing . 
  everyone knew the rules going in . 
  you ca n't really complain that you lost a football game because you shot 14 more times if you still scored less .
