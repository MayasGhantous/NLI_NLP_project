  just because you do n't like eating apples does not mean you think apples should all be purged , just means you do n't like eating apples . 
  scottish interests and english interests just are n't aligned much anymore is all . 
  castille / spain ? 
  they 're alright now i guess . 
  we could have easily been the same nation if their kings were n't asshats . 
  knowledge economies kind of rely on already established institutions . 
  the uk has a lot of labs , prestigious universities and so on , even more so on the financial sector whereas portugal does not and is undergoing massive brain drain to boot . 
  i think the one thing where we excel over most of the world is tropical disease medical research and that 'll help a lot when africa catches up but overall we 're not in a great spot . 
  at least in my country , it 's nice that the quality of life is this good while we 're losing our best and brightest to the bigger european nations and the us . 
  heck , most of my graduated friends have moved to the uk and germany already and i 'll most likely follow at some point . 
  it would be great if everyone in the world could be on the same footing and with a good quality of life . 
  it really would . 
  most european countries probably wo n't have the capability or natural resources to compete with newly developed countries and will likely suffer a loss in quality of life . 
  this might not apply to the bigger european countries like the uk or germany but for us living in the poorer european ones it would very likely become a concern . 
   the world needs every country to have strong economies . 
  sadly this would probably be catastrophic for the west . 
  slave labour and/or sweatshop workers benefit the western world massively ( surprisingly and sadly , they 're often a better bet for the workers compared to other jobs ) . 
   or our non-complex down to earth culture but that 's exactly why i want to move there . 
  dutch people are so much less of a headache . 
   italy or greece is an accident . 
  more like a reality of geography . 
  are you implying armenia is n't a country ? 
  we 'd call in the [ treaty of windsor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_windsor_\\ ( 1386 \\ ) ) . 
  no way we 're fighting without the uk . 
  this is weird ? 
  we do it too . 
  hey hey hey , all the portuguese immigrants over there are helping you catch up . 
  i totally get what you mean . 
  i also really want to partner up with someone without self-control or respect for me . 
  that sounds grand . 
  honestly , we still get dutch and czech tourists up in here aveiro . 
  likely because of it . 
  just have the galicians do the translating , we 'll be fine . 
  if we 're counting solely among europeans then the two languages are probably really close . 
   when more people speaks it than portuguese you what ? 
  i 'm all for catalan being an official language in both the eu and spain but let 's not get ahead of ourselves here . 
  there are by far more portuguese speakers . 
  same here . 
   i would have mentioned croatia , uruguay , egypt , japan and morocco before portugal , as they have a better rate . 
  japan and morocco have 1 entry each . 
  uruguay has 6 and croatia has 9 to portugal 's 33 entries . 
  it 's disingenuous to ignore the amount of entries when factoring in which countries to include . 
  why are you excluding portugal at 67 % rate of success though ? 
  as far as i 'm aware it 's because there 's is n't a mechanism ( in the eu agreements ) set in place for a country to leave the euro . 
  i dunno man , we portuguese love to play up our differences from the spanish but we end up being pretty similar . 
  hmm , have n't visited many but from the ones i have i 'll have to go with bordeaux . 
  from my experience , the silly dutch tourists go to the south . 
  the other ones come up north to porto / aveiro and they 're just more lax germans . 
  that said , i do like you lot . 
  they 're more portuguese than castillian , it fits . 
  you forgot to dislike the black sea !, 
  wait ... why do you dislike catalonia and why do you only think galicia is ok whilst you like portugal ? 
  that 's very odd . 
  [ not sure if it 's the typical portuguese spread . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwjronq.png ) still , that 's my split really . 
  russia would be a like if it were n't for recent activities round crimea and rebel-supporting . 
  i wish i could give galicia bit more than the rest of spain but that 's about it . 
  seems like the traditional english one . 
  if it helps , i 'm not against foreigners dictating economic policy for my country . 
  they ca n't possibly be worse than the portuguese politicians tending it to it now . 
  portugal here , we had it first . 
  i resent that . 
  i 've been to greece and italy and they 're insane compared to portugal and spain . 
  no portugal either . 
  let 's just agree we 're bros. 
  much like how finland is an autonomous part of sweden or russia depending on who you ask . 
  definitely . 
  portugal , the westernmost european country , is almost never included in ` western europe ' groupings . 
  it 's rather odd really . 
  most of my colleagues have gone to germany to work . 
  ( portuguese physicists ), 
  traffic overload from reddit probably . 
  you 'd still lose to portugal , spain or italy . 
  [ france beats you by 2 points . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal_in_the_eurovision_song_contest#voting_history ), 
   the free movement of people is by far the greatest problem and must be abolished hmm , why ? 
  let 's see . 
  i speak : - english - portuguese am learning : - spanish - dutch would like to learn : - norwegian ( or another scandinavian language , i 'm not picky ) - french - german - italian, 
  someone wants to learn portuguese ? 
  that 's a first . 
  to be fair , and i do n't oppose gay marriage at all , even if your parents divorce you still have a father and a mother . 
  how much they factor in your life is completely up to them both pre and post-divorce . 
  portugal can arguably be called an island , for most of our history with did n't want to deal with castille and were turned towards the atlantic . 
  we 're also the first colonial power . 
  we did dabble in the fascism though , ca n't argue that . 
  so , if you partition italy , france and germany wo n't poland and spain become too big then ? 
  do you partition those too ? 
  sounds fine to me . 
  see [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31wbop/sex_education_in_europe_turns_to_urging_more/cq5yxkk ) i made . 
  posted a bit below but you are correct , ireland and germany are outliers to this rule ( so are switzerland and austria ) but it does seem to apply . 
  cool , now let 's look at just european countries shall we ? 
  * france ( 112th , 2.08 ) * ireland ( 125th , 2.00 ) < - outlier , maybe * united kingdom ( 140th , 1.90 ) * iceland ( 142th , 1.88 ) * sweden ( 143rd , 1.88 ) * norway ( 145th , 1.86 ) * netherlands ( 156th , 1.78 ) * luxembourg ( 157th , 1.77 ) * finland ( 167th , 1.73 ) * denmark ( 168th , 1.73 ) * belgium ( 176th , 1.65 ) * switzerland ( 187th , 1.54 ) < - outlier * portugal ( 189th , 1.52 ) * spain ( 194th , 1.48 ) * estonia ( 197th , 1.46 ) * croatia ( 199th , 1.45 ) * bulgaria ( 200th , 1.44 ) * austria ( 201st , 1.43 ) < - outlier * germany ( 202nd , 1.43 ) < - outlier , granted * czech republic ( 203rd , 1.43 ) * greece ( 204th , 1.42 ) * italy ( 205th , 1.42 ) * hungary ( 206th , 1.42 ) * serbia ( 207th , 1.42 ) * slovakia ( 209th , 1.39 ) * latvia ( 211th , 1.35 ) * slovenia ( 212th , 1.33 ) * poland ( 213th , 1.33 ) * romania ( 214th , 1.32 ) * lithuania ( 216th , 1.29 ) it 's not like the article is talking about europe or anything . 
  it 's not a hard and fast rule especially for the germanics but it 's a trend . 
  people are n't having kids because they ca n't afford kids . 
  you fix the economy to fix the birthrate , not the other way around . 
  where 's the coat of arms on that spanish flag ? 
  northern portugal you mean ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ jk , galicians ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ you, 
  depends on how they ask the question . 
  i doubt many portuguese people will say they can speak spanish but all of them can understand it and can converse with someone who is speaking spanish .
