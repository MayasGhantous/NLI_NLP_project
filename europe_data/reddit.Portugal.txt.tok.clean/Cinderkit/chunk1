i guess it would be a similar situation if the exiled government in taiwan hypothetically got control of mainland china . 
  would they take responsibility for the tiananmen square massacre or claim that the `` real china '' was in taiwan at the time . 
  i thought i saw polls that showed that fillon voters would actually split pretty evenly between macron and le pen . 
  your point about it being better for fillon to stay still stands though if you 're a supporter of m\u00e9lenchon . 
  every . 
  time . 
  the main things that i know is that he appoints the prime minister , he can dissolve parliament and has a veto power on laws and stuff . 
  it was actually florida . 
  i looked it up . 
  guess what state this happened in . 
  there 's one in torres vedras . 
  i 've never been inside though . 
  now it just look 's like an anorexic 's penis . 
  yep , i got [ an email about the change ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ysellmq.png ) quickly followed by an [ email from lr complaining about it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tezwgpa.png ) . 
  [ about that ... ] ( https://www.google.com/amp/amp.dw.com/en/un-removes-four-peacekeepers-from-colombia-for-dancing-with-rebels/a-37032122 ), 
   mango mussolini i prefer cheeto benito . 
  kind of like the not-actually-a-jellyfish `` portuguese man o ' war '' . 
  eh , just give it to the canadians or something . 
   europe bears the responsability and the torch for social responsability , for a sustainable future on all fronts . 
  we are the light of the world whether we like it or not . 
  that sounds way too similar to the ` white man 's burden ' for my liking . 
  i believe the posted picture is of garrett mcnamara surfing the record breaking wave . 
  what ? 
  why would you be surprised that regions that have less people have less money to spend ? 
  you should n't deport le pen supporters no matter how much you disagree with them . 
  yeah , i used to live in trinidad and tobago and their biggest denomination is 100 ttd which converts to less than 14 euros . 
  an earthquake , tsunami and a fire on the same day . 
   in fact , portuguese cuisine , still heavily overshadowed by the cuisines of italy , spain and france , may be the most influential cuisine on the planet . 
  `` a commonly made post '', 
  only nuclear fallout does . 
  it 's not like [ some spanish guy ] ( http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/pais/2010-07-14-o-espanhol-que-tera-tentado-mudar-a-linha-de-fronteira-entre-portugal-e-espanha ) did n't already try that . 
  he 's listening to strawberry fields forever . 
  france is wrong . 
  as the prime minister , \u00c9douard philippe is the head of government of france . 
  macron is the head of state . 
  iceland is marked as 1.50-2 .09, 
  oh yeah , a while back i asked to add a\u00e7ores and madeira but there was n't enough space for both so only a\u00e7ores was added . 
  if there is space now , can you add madeira too ? 
  it was n't a wrong decision . 
  solar thermal is much more efficient in large scale electricity production . 
  for me , i can never stop associating that name with the cartoon troll . 
  eternity was believed to be much shorter back then . 
  that 's asturias . 
  that 's why the berbers avoided it . 
  [ g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies !,

  suck it spain !, 
  i do n't think * it 's the symbolism on there that is the problem . 
  it 's more that it looks like it was done on ms paint . 
  i believe all the land gets flooded during [ high tide so it ends up being an island ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/01/7b/21/017b21d155cfbbec912e114195c8692e.jpg ) . 
  i wrote it using cyrillic : ' \u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d ' . 
  that 's why it 's in quotes, 
  [ here 's an album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ci1fv ) of the different heraldic banners/flags of portugal i made a while back . 
  out of the things that marcelo vetoed , have any of them gone through despite that ? 
  just wondering , for portugal , did you use marcelo rebelo de sousa or ant\u00f3nio costa as the leader ? 
  i know it does n't alter your point but i just want to say that vengaboys are dutch and not german . 
  and then there was a contest for who was the worst and he won that too . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   diesel puts out particulates which results in smog/lung cancer/asthma/etc that 's why adblue exists . 
  in the 80s , some armenians blew up the turkish embassy in lisbon . 
  7 people died . 
  5 of those 7 were the terrorists . 
  1 was the wife of a turkish diplomat and the last one was a portuguese policeman trying to save her . 
  why is a bigger majority needed ? 
  is n't a simple majority enough to pass everything you want ? 
  i like this map . 
  you do know that , in the us , there 's a specific law that the secretary of defense can not be in the military and needs to be retired form it for at least 7 years if they were in it ? 
  they had to go through hoops to bypass the law for the current guy . 
  no it does n't sound weird . 
  it 's supposed to be a civilian in that position . 
  not picking someone with military experience was probably done on purpose . 
  what 's weird is that this made up problem of no military experience is only brought up when it 's a woman in that position despite the fact that the previous ministers were n't in the military either . 
  saying that is just asking for benfica to win again next year . 
   benfica won the league for the 4th time in a row it only 63 years after sporting first did the tetra . 
  / s anyway , congratulations to benfica and salvador sobral !, 
  no , they did n't `` miss badly '' . 
  stuff happened after the media blackout started that pushed would be abstentions towards macron . 
  i do n't really know about the candidates and i assume it 's the same for you . 
  the candidate pool was pretty big , as long as the ones chosen are all competent , it should n't be a problem . 
  you misspelt `` portugu\u00eas '' ... 
  they sell the best pasteis de nata around . 
  at least the closest lidl to me does . 
  * dis-moi gros gras grand grain d'orge , quand te d\u00e9gros-gras-grand-grain-d'orgeras-tu ? 
  currency per area, 
  you mean m\u00e9lenchon . 
  no way would macron suggest frexit . 
  wine is extremely cheap in portugal . 
  on thr other hand , gasoline is much more expensive . 
  there are so many towns in the us named after some other town . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/img/lisbons.jpg ) a map of all the lisbons in the us . 
  and in china they say `` france-france '' right ? 
  i 've heard him speak portuguese , german and english . 
  not sure what else he speaks . 
  the earthquake of 1755 maybe ? 
  so that my shitposts could reach a wider audience, 
  i went to saint-lary in the pyrenees for 2 weeks when i was in 4th grade . 
  we took the train from lisbon and then a bus . 
  we did lots of hiking in the mountains and some other stuff . 
  i do n't actually remember the reason for the field trip but it was really fun .
