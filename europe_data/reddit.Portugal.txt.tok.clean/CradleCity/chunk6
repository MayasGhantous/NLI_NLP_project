  does google still extract data from me ( online or offline ) ? 
  well , it tends to be mostly mainstream electronic music , at least according to the one and only time i was there ( one of the last good years , imo ) and the usual regulars across the years ( i suppose david guetta and the others are still there ) . 
  i also think they lost some of the prestige they had ( especially after that unfortunate incident ) . 
  oh , right i forgot that it was in lisbon this year . 
  as for rock in rio , i dislike it - too family-friendly , and too much emphasis in non-music entertainment . 
  the best ones in portugal are ( imo ) : ** [ nos alive ( formerly optimus alive ) ] ( http://nosalive.com/en/ ) ** ( the one with the most consistent quality of names in the line-up ) - it 's also in the outskirts of lisbon , so you can get to enjoy the city as well ** [ super bock super rock ] ( http://arena.meo.pt/en/agenda/super-bock-super-rock-2015_en/2188/ ) ** ( good names , and a nice beach nearby - meco beach - that you can reach by catching a festival bus - also great if you 're a fan of alternative/indie music ) ** [ paredes de coura ] ( http://www.paredesdecoura.com/ ) ** ( great for camping - i suggest getting there a couple of days before the festival begins , so that you can enjoy swimming in the river ), 
   two of them emerged from the crowd when marine le pen was laying a wreath in honour of joan of arc ( joa is frequently used as a nationalist symbol by the party ) . 
  i hate when they ( the fn ) do that . 
  they should not use her for political purposes ( then again , i quite like saint joan , so , they tend to piss me off a lot ) . 
  i think they are fairly aware of the fucked up history across most of europe . 
  i also suspect some people have a fear that the eu will one day collapse like the ussr or yugoslavia , and shit will hit the numerous fans . 
  you can send them to me / becauseausterityeffectsandeverycentisworthit, 
  i use the 5c coins ( and the others above that value ) . 
  1c and 2c coins are usually put in a box at the end of the month or week . 
  ah , ok . my apologies . 
  your identity started to form at nearly the same time as ours ( only a couple of decades separate us ) . 
  we may not be all pious , but most of us were at least [ raised catholic ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/raisedcatholic ) at some point . 
  some cultural/educational baggage derived from it prevails in our society . 
  stronger family ties also help a lot , as shamrockathens said . 
  thank you . 
  question to the fellow irish folks : one of her songs is called aililiu na gamnha . 
  what does it mean and what is it about ( if someone has ever listened to it ) ? 
  and considering that we beat them in the 14th century ( when the catalonian identity was n't yet consolidated ) - with a bit of help from the english - i 'd say that it 's not just down to luck . 
  edit : someone explain me why i 'm being downvoted for stating a historical fact , please . 
  morocco only became independent in 1956 ( from france ) . 
  before that , it had been ( in order , from the most recent to the most ancient ) a french protectorate , a spanish protectorate ( with a few cities belonging to portugal , e.g. 
  ceuta ) . 
  the ruling house of morocco , the alaouite dynasty , reunited morocco in 1666 , when portugal had already lost ceuta to the spanish . 
  i 've also noticed that the moroccan government does n't have a diplomatic rivalry with the portuguese government , since , in the words of the current leader , `` the portuguese did not have colonizing pretensions against morocco '' . 
  our song is just bland shit , imo . 
  drunk, 
  because regional producers do n't have the means of mass production that the us has . 
  not to mention the price competition . 
  you 've just read * that * polandball comic , admit it . 
   depends upon the group . 
  if it is a class , `` a turma '' , etc. . . 
  it can be hard . 
  a turma is a turma . 
  just because it has a gender-inclined linguistics attached to it for the sake of linguistic formality and tradition ( and no , you can not claim that i use an appeal to tradition here ) , does n't mean it is misgendering people . 
  and what about a mixed group of people in an informal setting ? 
  what would be a term ( think a mixed group of friends ) ? 
   i am bothered when i am misgendered . 
  i would assume that i am not alone in this and i have heard from people that the notion that a certain gender can be used as the default gender bothers them as well . 
  can you please explain why the effort not to misgender anyone bothers you so much ? 
  see , here 's the thing . 
  if you 're bothered , you can just tell me what pronoun or name you want me to use when addressing you . 
  that 's fine . 
  what is not fine is that you presume that people who do not necessarily share atributes/genders with you want to be called by a certain way , perhaps without consulting them . 
  when in a mixed group of men , women , third sex people , genderfluid people , cyborgs and so forth , what term would you use ( i 'm actually curious to know , you know ) ? 
  and what if the term you use would not be considered to be ok with someone in that group ? 
  and what if the term just does n't hold water , linguistically speaking ? 
   so i simply describe the group in another appropriate term and what is the term ? 
   i currently do n't know of any portuguese pronoun that can be used to talk about a mixed group without misgendering a portion of said group . 
  does said group actively complained to you about misgendering , or are you presuming that they 're bothered ? 
   in portuguese even the plural is gendered ( so you 'd say something like `` shes '' or `` hes '' ) and when talking about a mixed group of people everybody says `` hes '' . 
  and , pray tell us , what ... change would you want portuguese people to make ? 
  or , alternatively , what word would you suggest to be the equivalent of ` they ' ? 
   will hollande be the triple h of this problem ? 
  my mind does not compute such an analogy/image/whatever . 
  yeah , salazar was quite the stubborn guy . 
  also , we were the last europeans to have some territory/special province in east asia ( namely , macau ) . 
  where is rivendell located , then ? 
  same here . 
  the balkans , man ... 
  sebastianists might not like this , but [ king sebastian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sebastian_of_portugal ) was an idiot . 
  what kind of guy goes to fight in north africa , with an army of 10,000 against an army fo 60,000 / 70,000 , without leaving an heir behind or even marrying ? 
  it 's no wonder that a couple of years later , we were defeated and forced to join the iberian union , which would become very harmful to us after filipe ii ( i of portugal ) kicked the bucket . 
  we probably fled to a place closer to brazil and took our land with us . 
  portugal - [ madredeus - haja o que houver ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhxti4nftdc ), 
   france , portugal-italy-spain and eastern europe because it 's all the same stuff . 
  you sound like a ` murican . 
  by banana , you mean cocaine , right ? 
  great , another stupid person giving a bad name to a faith i happen to share with said person . 
  ( sigh ) idiot nun . 
  i hope the police takes care of the matter . 
  happy easter , fellow europeans !, 
  enjoy your lamb ( or any other special food ) . 
  [ the air crash that killed francisco s\u00e1 carneiro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_camarate_air_crash ), 
  for those who read/watch hetalia , this is doubly hilarious . 
  do n't feel bad about it . 
  you had good intentions , anyway , and i 've seen countryballs getting way more `` bashed '' than our ` worthless shit rectangle ' . 
  at least , we do n't have significant independence movements . 
  do you even have to remind me of that depressive comic ? 
  my bigger problem is not even people using it or not . 
  it 's younger students being punished in terms of grades in exams for daring to write in pre-reform portuguese . 
  edit : i 'm 23 . 
  am i too old ? 
  glad i 'm not the only one . 
  it depends . 
  there are people who actually pronounce the word ` egipto ' with the p in a non-mute manner . 
  besides , the textual impact is far more important than the verbal impact , since , in this case , ` facto/fato ' , or ` pacto/pato ' are prone to confusion ( sometimes even with context ) . 
  so true . 
  not to mention the ` facto/fato ' issue . 
   made a concerted effort to try and make portuguese a more unified language , making it more relevant wordwide . 
  an example of these amendments would be getting rid of the umlaut in brazil , which is n't used in portugal . 
  and getting rid of the ` p ' in ` egypt ( ` egipto ' , now ` egito ' ) , the capital letter in the months ' names and other incoherent stuff ? 
  ( i 'm against the orthographic agreement , you see :p ), 
  ah , so that was the name ( oddly enough , it 's that name in the portuguese wikipedia , but it 's muscle dysmorphia in the english wikipedia ) . 
  white ? 
  ` thinspiration ' ?
