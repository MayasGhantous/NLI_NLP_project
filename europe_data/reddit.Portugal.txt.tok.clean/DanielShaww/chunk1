automation is going to get rid of the unskilled lower level jobs usually consisting of mundane tasks . 
  sure , you may not be able to become a cashier in 50 years , but are people complaining about not being able to become log drivers , lamplighters , chimney sweepers or coal hurriers today ? 
  history tells us that when jobs disappear there will be other jobs to replace those . 
  these tend to be more advanced and less mundane than the previous ones . 
  so in reality society tends to change for the better . 
  you need to watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-s557xqu, 
  first comet to have free healthcare . 
  take that , moon !, 
  windows 7 , thinking of using linux but muh games . 
  language . 
  i 'll repeat what i said last time : `` why should they ? 
  they 've got the best of both worlds : schengen for their citizens , free trade for their industry and the council of europe to have a voice in european matters . 
  all of this without any of the disadvantages and obligations . 
  they 're essentially norway 2.0 '', 
  it 'd be interesting to see old man cavaco using strong language ... or saying anything for that matter . 
  our president is a spectator mostly so there 'd be some cheering . 
  can we start linking articles in its translated form ? ... 
  or at least include a hint about its language in the title . 
  anyway , i 'm pleasantly surprised so many romanians are still concerned about their country 's future to take their time to vote while away from it . 
  good on them and hopefully these serve as an example for people in their ** own countries ** who could n't give an arse about elections and their right to vote . 
  it also does n't factor in the # 2 billion wales just received . 
  funny how the guardian did not report that . 
  i know cape verde wants to join the eu, 
   the reason for this is the position of the major player in the war in ukraine . 
  this player is not russia -- the country that unleashed the war in ukraine . 
  this player is the west or , to be more precise , europe . 
  obviously , when russia invades another country its the eu 's fault . 
  ukraine is not in the eu and is not a nato member , which means the west has zero obligations to do jack about the situation . 
  we are n't the world 's police and are as liable about this as china is , which means nothing . 
  portuguese talk shit about spain all the time because they know its the only country that would do anything to help us out . 
  it 's like a bigger brother who we can rely on . 
  edit : i 'd also like to add sweden to the list . 
  i 'm kinda obsessed with it , it 's weird . 
  must be the culture , the weather . 
  maybe the women . 
  there 's actually a time where i googled about sweden but unfortunately found a site dedicated to trash talking them because they are cold and distant , so that 's a bit sad . 
  still , i 'll visit whenever i can . 
  oh , and croatia . 
  i have a friend from there and he 's just great . 
  taught me how to pronounce the `` r '' like a russian . 
  portugal : portuguese emigrant detained in us for money-laundering ** $ 400 million ** for the mafia ; http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/portuguese-emigrant-detained-in-us-money-laundering-for-the-mafia/33035 a portuguese gambler won ** 190 million euros ** ( 150 millions after taxes ) in the euromillions .

  the results are n't weird at all . 
  heck , with 1800 users you can extrapolate to about 100 000 people and have the conclusions be within an acceptable error margin . 
  next survey 's results will probably have 5x more people participating but i bet the % results will be the same . 
  of course they are , but it 's not getting any media attention , which is why they made this film . 
   a big improvement on space exploration public outreach it 's funny that you mentioned this , because esa just released the making of , and one person involved in the film 's creation said [ this , which makes me very sad . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srdho1dctc&amp;t=8m18s ) . 
  it 's a bit clich\u00e9 , but i can almost feel the engineers and scientists ' despair that rosetta is getting so little attention . 
  esa is our nasa equivelent . 
  they are mindblowingly close to a heck of an achievement : sending a small probe made of metal to space , making it travel for 10 long , calculated and sometimes blind years before orbiting next to a comet traveling at 50 000 km/h with an error margin of less than 1 km/h . 
  and then land on it !!, 
  and did that by using other planets ' gravity like its their personal bitch . 
  and yet , few know , or seem to care . 
  even after making a sci fi short movie with some hipster looking dude and plot development out of a porno but some serious looking special effects , and even on / r/europe it does n't get much attention . 
  at least curiosity was talked about :(, 
  then it shall fade into oblivion , forever forgotten ... shame on you !, 
  how can be people outside the uk and ireland that speak only one language ( i assume their native one ) and yet browse / r/europe and take surveys ? 
  something is fishy, 
  sticky this . 
   `` what we need in britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the european union '' yes , renegotiate schengen , renegotiate the euro , renegotiate the charter of fundamental rights of the european union . 
  what you 're not renegotiating is your exit that should have been yesterday , not next year 's referendum . 
  god speed cameron !, 
  you think that 's cool ? 
  wait until you know what his party 's name is . 
  `` swedish people 's party of finland '', 
  meh since it turns out it will be a reboot i 'll suggest that you keep all the questions except the ones about drugs and piracy ( maybe just keep the ones about steam and whatnot , but keep it relevant ) . 
  also , remove questions like `` which european country is your least favourite '' , adds little to the discussion and becomes a circlejerk both ways . 
  then , add questions like : 1 . 
  what do you think should be the military budget ( % of gdp ) of the european countries ( individually speaking ) 2 . 
  do you think the european union should have its own military ? 
  if so , what would its budget be ? 
  what european countries have you lived in ? 
  what european countries have you visited ? 
  how do you view the separatist movements ? 
  ( e.g catalonia , basque country ) 5 . 
  how do you view immigration ( e.g north africans and syrians to europe ) ? 
  speaking of immigration , if you 're not from europe , why visit / r/europe ?!?!, 
  if norway and switzerland keep refusing to join the union , should the eu annex them ? 
  but why iceland volcanos ? 
  i actually think those were the most interesting . 
  especially the prejudice ones . 
  would be a circlejerk of australia , canada and united states . 
  considering the sub has grown 50k subscribers since the last survey , i believe you 'd get a fresh perspective even if it was exactly the same . 
  what i mean is , i hope the questions are still relevant and on point , instead of new ones just for the sake of variety . 
  any reason for it to be a reboot ? 
  i think last years ' surveys were really well rounded and even somewhat extensive in regards to the questions they asked . 
  thus , if this one follows the same pattern then i do n't think there 's anything else i 'd like to be asked . 
  i 've just returned from the states that are united ( i saw soybean fields that were bigger than portugal and had their own weather forecast ) so i 'm gon na need some context here edit : alright had to do my homework i guess , so here 's the rundown : - new president of the european comission means 27 new commissioners-designate ( one from each country ) selected by juncker and assigned specific portfolios ; - * `` commissioners-designate will face a thorough scrutiny by meps before the new european commission can start its five-year term on 1 november . 
  the idea behind the hearings is to assess each candidate 's competence on the portfolio they have been assigned . 
  '' * - all 27 commissioners nominated by eu states must get the approval of the european parliament before they can join commission president jean-claude juncker 's top team . 
  - [ some comissioners have some explaining to do ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/five-commission-nominees-who-look-vulnerable-ahead-of-hearings/ ) , particularly alenka bratu\u0161ek who is considered to be from * `` wrong country , wrong political group , sensitive portfolio ( energy union ) , wrong profile . 
  '' * - european voice reports : `` slovenian nominee alenka bratu\u0161ek has been identified by many as a weak link in jean-claude juncker 's line-up . 
  it is bratu\u0161ek 's misfortune that she comes from a small country and does not have the support of even that country 's current government . 
  she is vulnerable because of the way she was nominated . '', 
  - you can recap her hearing [ here ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/alenka-bratuseks-confirmation-hearing-live-blog/ ) , video will be uploaded later . 
  spoiler : she dun goofed - slovenians are not amused with their eu representative 's crucial performance and consider she made a mockery of her country - we 'll have to wait to know the parlament 's decission , but commissioners-designate have been deemed unfit for less, 
  stop downvoting him because you disagree . 
  here , take an upvote . 
  2nd place usa wtf, 
  hk belongs to china , not any eu state .
