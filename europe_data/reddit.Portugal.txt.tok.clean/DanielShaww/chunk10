  grumble grumble, 
  2 years ago portugal was in a much worse position . 
  i do n't think we 'd leave now . 
   there are protests scheduled for tomorrow outside the parliament . 
  really ? 
  i think it is a case of `` means to an end '' . 
  if this is what the icelandic people wishes then be done with it . 
  do you wor for euractiv ? 
   the icelandic currency is rubbish and the country has operated under foreign exchange controls since the crisis . 
  peg your currency to the euro . 
  if anything goes horribly wrong , cut the tie . 
  the entire southern coast of the iberian peninsula is pretty much an english colony . 
  that 's exactly his point , someone from alaska has to travel 3 times the distance to reach florida than someone from germany does to get to spain , but one is considered international travel and enters the charts and the other is not . 
  usa is so vast that many americans travel domestically , if europe was considered a single country we 'd find similar results , maybe even less so . 
  not just americans , turism to is growing worldwide . 
  i think the average is 6 % a year . 
  my country registered 14 % growth iirc . 
  or even japan and korea ... they 're racist as fuck . 
  soon will be able to buy an hotel with $ 1 in all of europe , not just the eastern countries . 
  exactly , whatever the currency of the world 's largest economy does , it will influence everything around it , making it so that it is the world that adapts to the circumstances , not the opposite . 
  here we go ... 
  thought you were talking about ice cream for a minute . 
  and people wonder why they get ticketed playing euro truck simulator . 
  because that 63 % figure is for electricity , not energy . 
  electrical consumption only accounts for ~ 30 % of ** energy ** consumption , which includes transportation ( fossil fuels go here ) and heating ( natural gas goes here ) . 
   i 'll never understand what 's the status of gibraltar . 
  it 's a tax heaven . 
  * poland, 
  they should have a thumbnail that highlighted them . 
  what a nonsense ... the american guy is fit . 
  knew it , no sources to back up this `` imperial threat that the eu posses to switzerland '' . 
   schengen , common market , please , as if the swiss did n't benefit from these . 
  i 'm sure you feel oppressed when no one asks for your passport when you cross the italian border for vacations or the french border to buy groceries . 
  and you know why you need to adopt a lot of eu regulations ? 
  because 99 % of your trade is with the eu , and the eu is n't the wild west where everything goes and there 's no standards for the imported products . 
  the eu did n't force switzerland to adopt those regulations , the swiss adopted them anyway because it 'd hurt their economy not to do so , just like norway does . 
  and what 's that about the eu threatning switzerland ? 
  can you link any independent source on it , or is it just fairy tales like much of what has been written so far ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  how do you integrate into something you 're not part of ? 
  when an immigrant goes from one country to another , he * integrates * into his new society , because now he 's a part of it . 
  he does n't integrate into that society when he 's at his home country , does he ? 
  eu integration sounds like meaningless buzzwords . 
   as there is no ` european news.google.com ' equivalent http://www.europeanvoice.com/ http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 https://euobserver.com/ http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe/roundup http://www.cnn.com/europe http://news.yahoo.com/europe/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ http://www.bbc.com/news/world/europe/ http://www.euronews.com/ hope these help !, 
  that 's a dank meme , i wonder what the mods think about that !, 
   vote 2016 for whoever will get us out of nato . 
  who are those ? 
  the republicans or the democrats ? 
  greece needs to follow romania 's path . 
  there were talks about switzerland joining the eu but then some asshole opened / r/europe and reminded everyone why they 're out . 
  seems like a possible scenario . 
   swiss ` neutrality ' basically translates to `` all money is equal '' fantastic quote , i 'm taking it !, 
  euro has got greece by the balls ... 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  in this case hundreds of wrongs . 
   the one constant in swiss politics for the last two decades is the forces for more eu integration vs. the isolationists . 
  this is so false ... like wtf , are you sure you 're a swiss ? 
  the only constant for the last two decades has been to maintain the status quo as much as possible , and the politicians do n't give two craps about eu membership because they know a referendum would never pass . 
  bloody warzone this thread . 
  +1 for lars mikkelsen, 
  that 'd be asking too much . 
  dude , chill out , it 's just a joke . 
  there 's hope in this world . 
  top banter . 
  why ... why would anyone want to buy a railway ? 
  the typhoon can win a race against a veyron though . 
  that 's because south florida is filled with cubans and northern us retirees . 
  what are those dank memes style called ? 
  there are obvious reasons not to the that , the most important one being money . 
  not in my back yard, 
  eurovision is one of the most watched television events in the entire world . 
  if i recall correctly last year it was just behind the world cup final . 
  same comment i wrote on / r/european :  `` when it has been the history of unity , as we 've seen under napoleon and hitler or under the soviets in eastern europe , it has gone disastrously wrong . 
  it is a papering over the discordant elements in european history to create this idealised event . '' i wonder how an academic like herself can make so na\u00efve statements . 
  during napoleon and hitler 's rule , europe was everything but united . 
  still , i agree that there 's clearly an agenda trying to be pushed , not that i believe it is a wrong one : that europe can only succeed together . 
  finabel , european corps , european gendarmerie force , european air transport command , european air group , european maritime force , movement coordination centre europe , organisation for joint armament cooperation . 
  what a bloody mess , all organizations trying to achieve cooperation between europe 's armed forces , one way or the other . 
  there 's no need for any of this , it 's eu army , eu navy , eu air force, 
  for those who missed it , full debate here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u4iecc3xr0, 
   but since we are in the euro zone and germany benefits from a strong euro and here i thought export heavy germany benefited from a * weak * euro !, 
  finns and portuguese are much more alike than i thought , in times of incompetence we both blame the germans . 
  and by the way , the fastest growing economy in europe happens to be a country in the eurozone . 
  i do n't think that 's how geography works . 
  europol sounds badass, 
  \\  from uk \\  speaks 2 languages something does n't add up . 
  any idea why they 're replacing them ? 
  i feel ... [ filthy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cs1cuixbvg&amp;t=6m21s ), 
   `` eu 's soft power must be matched by collective hard power and a more efficient use of our $ 210 billion yearly defence spending . '' dito, 
  the whole thing is ridiculous . 
  that 's really unusual . 
  are you in one of those old villages ? 
   i am visiting portugal right now ... 
  this is the worst fucking place i have ever been , and i 'm portuguese !, 
  one is not like the other !, 
  did n't conquer the world for this shit . 
   the portuguese drivers are very careful and are seen braking downhill to not surpass the 120 km/h limit :o, 
  similar argument to why should i wash my dishes if they 'll get dirty again . 
  [ moi je joue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js3t51n3eqc ) oh brigitte , i 'd dissapoint you so hard . 
  like in programming , you solve big problems by slicing them into tiny bits that you can solve .
