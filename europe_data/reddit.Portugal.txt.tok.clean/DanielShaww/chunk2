  thus , whatever happens in hk , as long as it involves chinese citizens , its china problem to deal with , not eu . 
  stop strying to make something an eu problem when it is n't .

   `` oh salted sea , how much of your salt are portuguese tears ? '', 
  god damn it pessoa , what have you done . 
  lol, 
  you would n't know until you read the article . 
  170k a day if i recall correctly, 
  `` an eu commission '' just like `` a us supreme court '' or a `` us congress '', 
  thanks , i needed some updates on my sources . 
  however , that 's still a sizeable amount of people willing to leave , not to mention the sample size is n't that great ( considering britain 's population ) and that a majority of this year 's polls where the stay won did n't include northern ireland . 
  also , the poll where the base were people who would definitely vote in referendum the leave won with 8 percentage points over the stay . 
  finally , these polls must be taken with a grain of salt , considering similar polls gave the scotland yes much more influence than they really had , so much so that they actually voted no . 
  what we can definitely conclude for this , however , is that the uk 's population is divided on this issue and thus deserves a referendum to , definitely , make their voices heard in this eu matter . 
  gon na need some sources on that . 
  you have n't voted , officially . 
  but there are polls that give a fairly comfortable win to people who 'd vote yes in `` i want the uk to leave the eu '' - if you wish i will source this statement . 
  i mean , if the fact that your ** prime minister ** is talking about a referendum to leave the eu or that the fastest growing party was the ukip , or that that party 's lider , nigel farage , has an ever stronger ( and thank goodness for that ) following , shared by brits who share his views . 
  tell me again , how is that just `` speaking the loudest '' ? 
  i have no strong feelings one way or the other , the uk people do . 
  they 've made it pretty clear they want out , and we should respect their will . 
  in that case , the faster they leave the better . 
  already said this : the uk should leave the eu , it 's too much hypocrisy what they 're doing . 
  your source cites a 84 % ** global historical maximum ** . 
  [ wikipedia cites 90.3 % for us reactors , but then goes on saying 70 % in the 1971-2009 period and 88.7 % in 2006-2012 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capacity_factor ) also from wikipedia , uk and france hover between 50 % and 70 % , [ and the largest nuclear plant in the world has a capacity factor of 48 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashiwazaki-kariwa_nuclear_power_plant ), 
  i googled `` largest nuclear power plant '' . 
  that was my sole criteria to chose it . 
  by the way , could you link me the source of the 5000 mw ? 
  part of the solution is to : - not relly on just one form of renewable . 
  wind and hydro are the main ones , but there 's also solar , biomass and others ; - connect even more the european grid . 
  there are situations in which one country produces more from wind than it needs , so it might export it . 
  on the opposite , there might be other countries who are over supplied with energy from hydro due to heavy rains ( portugal 's case this month ) , so they can export it . 
  wind is not the solution , but a solution . 
  the solution , however , is an [ intelligent grid ] ( http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/how-an-algorithm-is-uniting-europes-electrical-fiefdoms ) and a sufficient installed capacity of renewables . 
  wind capacity in the eu alone accounts for 1/3 of all nuclear power plants combined . 
  it 's not a nonsense by any means . 
  you 'd need 6 if those were the largest npp in the world and were at ~ ~ full throttle ~ ~ 75 % the whole time . 
  if you use that specific plant 's capacity factor then : 0.49 * 7 gw * amount = 117 gw * 0.3 amount = ( 117 gw * 0.3 ) / ( 0.49 * 7 gw ) amount ~ 10 plants, 
  actually , the 8 % came from the 2013 production , not net capacity . 
  thus , that value is actually correct . 
  check their values for yourself . 
  edit : nvm i understood `` what are netherlands values '' and meant that they were there like other countries . 
  correct , wind turbine 's capacity factor oscilates between 20-40 % . 
  however , i think you are somewhat overestimating nuclear power plants ' value . 
  wikipedia cites 70-80 % , with some exceptions 90 % . 
  the nuclear plant i referenced in this graph actually has a capacity factor of 48 % , and that 's the largest in the world . 
  but i have their data , i just chose not to include them ... 
  if the country has its name over it , then it was included . 
  what 's hard to understand about that ? 
  what do you mean by `` no data '' ? 
  i have the data from every single eu country , and they 're all labeled . 
  this is the source : http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/reports/ewea_annual_report_2013.pdf, 
  maybe because it 's not an infograph ... 
  dang it , here 's the correct version : http://i.imgur.com/9gtydis.png, 
  borders were already changed in 21st century europe . 
  in fact , you are older than a few european countries . 
  in 10 years you 'll be thankful , consider it a future investment . 
  i posted this 6 days ago ... 
  whether you like it or not , ukip is on the right track to become an influencial party . 
  they started from scratch and look where they are now , even if they 're not the strongest out there . 
  hopefully , british people wake up and vote for them , farage gets a lot of hate but he 's right , uk is better off without the eu . 
  government shuts everything off because portugal has an excess of installed power . 
  last year , 58 % of the electric consumption came from renewables . 
  this year is expected to reach 65 % , january alone was 90 % from renewables . 
  everyone wants to connect their solar panels to the grid , but no one wants to pay the associated costs with doing it . 
  just a joke guys , no need to downvote jeez, 
  what 's that ? 
  why does that have to be discussed in / r/energypolitics ? 
  it 's not as if this subreddit was massive , we can perfectly have discussions around that same subject here . 
  not bashing , just found it odd . 
  the euro is a moral imperative to the european union . 
  countries who join the eu are obliged , by law , to adopt it , but because some are n't pleased with that idea they either lobby their way out ( so that they have no legal obligations , like you eloquently put it ) - or delay it indefinitely . 
  there is a set form of voluntary requirements that are expected to be met once a country is part of the eu , and being out of the euro is ** not ** the norm , and never was . 
  i do n't understand why you think it is perfectly reasonable for the u.k or denmark to be both in the eu and out of the eurozone . 
  and i never said some countries are better than the others . 
  norway is n't even in the eu and they are a role model to all of europe , not only because of their values and ethics , but because their transparecy and morals are shown even in this simplest form : they do n't try to small talk the eu into bending its rules to benefit norway and diminish its financial exposure . 
  no , they stay the heck out of it and that 's it . 
  a solid and clearly defined position . 
  as i said , countries who do not see themselves using the euro as their currency , for whatever reason it might be , and no one has the right to judge them for it , should hold a referendum to leave the union and continue their separate ways . 
  it would be best for both . 
  this is the jerkiest of circles . 
  on a serious note , glad you enjoy the sense of community . 
  you can have a lot of things without having many other things . 
  `` you can have * a * without * b * '' . 
  replace a and b with whatever you want and it will probably still hold true , but that does n't make it appropriate to the european union . 
  can you have a single market without a common currency ? 
  absolutely , should that be the case of the eu ? 
  can you have free movement without being in schengen ? 
  most possibly . 
  should that be the case with the eu ? 
  the eu has a unique set of values and beliefs that should be held together , not as boxes to tick , but as requirements to fill . 
  also , nato predates the european union and being in one does not mean being in the other . 
  what i meant by `` common security and defence policies '' was [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#defence_.e2.80.93_denmark ) , just one of many examples , unfortunately . 
  you can buy super bock in the states , even sumol last time i was there presunto not so much, 
  i know exactly the meaning of what i said , and i hold by my words . 
  for what it 's worth , we 're a union of opt-outs : 1 . we want free access to 450 million consumers , but not the same currency ; 2 . we want free movement of labour , goods , services and capital but opt out of schengen ; 3 . 
  we want membership in a stable , secure , democratic community but do n't want to deal with its common security and defence policies . 
  we want , but do n't want to give . 
  we take part of , but we do n't commit .
