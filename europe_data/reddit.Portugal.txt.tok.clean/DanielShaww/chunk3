  it 's kinda of weird , countries in the eu but not in the eurozone basically want what the eu as a single market and free movement of goods and all that has to offer , but none of the risks associated with having a shared currency accross all europe . 
  in my opinion , after the free movement of people , the greatest thing to come out of the eu is a shared currency . 
  you are free to disagree , but you must at least admit that this is hypocrisy . 
  either we 're a union and we 're all in for good or we 're all out , like norway , not this european union of asterisks we live in . 
  finally , i believe eu countries whose citizens and politicians do not wish to use the euro as their national currency in the foreseeable future should hold a referendum to leave the union . 
  damn i forgot europe had a police too . 
  we 're a freaking country and we do n't know it yet . 
  he 's right tho :(, 
  am i allowed to bring it tho ? 
  if it 's illegal and all . 
  dark knight edit : it was a joke guys - . -, 
  should i delete this one ? 
  want to share your storie ? 
  just because it does n't mention victor hugo does n't mean his federation ideas were n't present , 2 of the interviewed people believe the future of europe is a federation . 
  as i said , use the english closed captions .

  that 'd make him a native norwegian .

  supposedly there was a full survey comming but it 's taking so long i might aswell creat it myself . 
  i believe it had 50 people and 2 policemen . 
  it does n't . 
  you tell the meeting commences at 7:45 hoping it starts at 8:00 so that at least you are sure by 8:15 it will be going , only to find that at 8:30 is when most people start arriving . 
  gib germoney, 
  thanks , will do edit : nvm . 
  yes , soviet . 
  my mistake . 
  in the bottom it says : `` the european community - smiling at each other , then a knife behind the back '' is it accurate ? 
  fuck no , it 's a propaganda poster , from the ~ ~ russians ~ ~ soviets , no less !, 
  why are you so up and arms trying to disprove it ? 
  we all know it 's innacurate , but it has an historical value that makes it worth sharing . 
  european community is translated from the poster . 
  how is that misleading ? 
  aw cmon, 
  do tell !, 
  do n't worry spain , if cata leaves , portugal will join . 
  oh look , it 's federal europe friday .

  be proud of your history . 
  fine , we 'll create our own europe , with iceland and finland !, 
  stop nitpicking things . 
  i explained that sentence in the comment you replied , but you seem to ignore that . 
  since you insist , i 'll address your reply . 
   amalia has a very important place in the history of fado , and she projected it and brought a lot into it ( the poets , the historical poems ) . 
  but she did not create it , and fado is larger than just what she sung about . 
  fado was , before amalia , very much a neighbourhood thing of lisbon and of a different kind , a student thing of coimbra and it still is . 
  completly true , which is why i said , in the very comment you replied to : `` i did n't say she literally created it , she made it popular . 
  she 's the face of fado . 
  am\u00e1lia owes to fado as much as fado owes am\u00e1lia , and that 's a fact . '', 
  when i say the beatles made rock , do i mean that they literally , single handedly created the genre ? 
  no , i mean their work was so substantial to it that they might aswell have . 
  it 's a matter of context and not semantics , as you 're forcing it to be . 
   and your selection sucks . 
  that 's just , like , your opinion man . 
  are you a fado authority to enlighten us plebs on what are proper examples of the genre and which are n't ? 
  because , if so , let me know . 
  besides , in the very freaking thread i created i said her work was vast and could n't post all of it , why do you take it so personally that the two songs i chose were so off your standards that you felt the need to start a reply with that typical portuguese condescending tone `` vai aprender um pouco ... '' excuse me ? 
  i wo n't allow a `` tiny lecture '' by someone who says gaivota is not an essential work of am\u00e1lia . 
  now , for my part , this discussion is over . 
  oh boy i 'm being lectured about fado . 
  i 'm out . 
  i did n't say she literally created it , she made it popular . 
  she 's the face of fado . 
  am\u00e1lia owes to fado as much as fado owes am\u00e1lia , and that 's a fact . 
  it means there 's something they have more in common with arab than europeans . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  germany has 1.36 , spain 1.47 , just to name a few . 
  surely , not 1.15 but it was not meant to be super accurate , just to give a general idea . 
  that 's 80 % more than major european countries, 
  people who put their money where their mouth is collectively believe there 's an 83 % chance of a no vote . 
  personally , i 'd trust them . 
  yes , and promptly kicked out by the crusaders . 
  which then went to the middle east and governed things there for a few centuries too , does that count too ? 
  surprised at the lack of portuguese , last time it was asked was / r/europe 's favourite . 
  no one is bragging . 
  colonization was a real aspect of most european countries ' history , and such countries have strong ties between them . 
  there 's no shame in being an ex-colony whatsoever .

  i 'd put in there angola . 
  yes , in the same way once you 're bigger than your father he becomes your son . 
  i said ex-colony not oversea territories . 
  / s or ? 
  `` eurovision song contest headquarters . '', 
  cringe as heck but super cute straya, 
  6:48 i understand now, 
  the uk ... a shade of what it once us . 
  man , we used to be huge . 
  add up britain , spain , france and portugal 's territories and you cover , what , 90 % of the world 's land surface ? 
  remember to view the entire album , more at the end !, 
  huh yes ? 
  will there be nba players playing ? 
  half of your video is in the airport/plane . 
   so basically wind power is less safe than nuclear power , thats pretty much a fact if any . 
  if your understanding of `` safe '' is solely based on human lives lost , and , even worse , based on wind power ( which is just one of many renewables ) alone , then yes , i guess nuclear is indeed safer . 
  however , to tackle your point since you are a rare breed of people who provide sources around here : people die somewhere in the process of making or installing the turbine and , because that number turns out to be higher than the ** direct ** nuclear related deaths , you , and the article 's author , assume that wind is indeed more dangerous than nuclear . 
  for several reasons , that 's decieving . 
  in that same article you linked , the author realizes that and even goes on saying :  harness and personal protective gear for maintenance workers is also an easy fix and one that many other industries adopted to reduce worker death and harm . 
  and finishes it :  these are reasonable actions to take to make wind energy safer , especially since we anticipate wind farms to grow dramatically in the next 30 years . 
  reasonable , do n't you think ? 
  it 's the way people are dying that makes the difference here , not necessarily the amount . 
  they are dying in ways ** parallel ** to wind , not ways that are caused by it .
