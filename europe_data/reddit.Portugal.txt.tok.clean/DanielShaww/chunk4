  they die in the same way [ vending machines kill 13 people per year ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/07/things-likely-kill-than-shark ) . 
  when someone dies in a nuclear power event , that 's secondary and part of something way bigger . 
  if you do n't mind , i 'll quote myself in an answer i gave to someone before and forgive the rather agressive tone :  when an accident with a renewable happens , a couple of people die because a turbine was caught on fire while they were doing maintenance , or a roofer falls 10 meters while installing a solar panel . 
   when a nuclear accident happens , cities become inhabitable waste lands out of a zombie apocalypse , food markets are shut or incapacitated for weeks until the threat has been dealt with and billions are spent on decommissioning the plant . 
  decades later you are taught about those disasters in school and the people who died trying to contain the problem are called heroes . 
  all around the world you remember the victims and morn their deaths . 
   things like chernobyl and fukushima happened and you have the nerve to say that renewables are `` prone '' to causing accidental deaths ? 
   without searching , tell me one accident involving a renewable source that was half as bad as either chernobyl , three miles island , or fukushima that caused comparable lost of human lives , comparable waste of land , comparable world disturbance ( economy , markets , etc ) , comparable monetary costs and most importantly , comparable social impact . 
  the fact that you ca n't should prove my point , but go on and search ; you wo n't find anything anywhere near the same magnitude , let alone half . 
  onto the another point  i cba to find a source but my windpower engineer buddy mentioned a nuclear power plant pay itself off in 2-3 years yeah ... when people start bringing anecdotes to an argument then the discussion starts going downhill ( and you even started so well with a source try and prove your point ) . 
  `` well , uh , i also happen to have an engineer buddy and he mentioned nuclear plants kill kittens and their staff are literally hitler . '', 
  point is , and while i do n't accuse you of lying , this wo n't lead anywhere . 
  not only that , it 's completly bullshit . 
  not that you have an buddy engineer , but that it pays itself off in 2-3 years . 
  why ? 
  because a ** typical ** power plants [ costs short of $ 10 billion , e.g in link ] ( http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionc.htm#darlington ) , ** not to mention operation costs ** . 
  to pay itself in that time span means a revenue of $ 5 billion plus , so unless you can link me a source here , i 'm calling bullshit . 
  the windmill one tho seems right . 
   has a lifespan of 12-14 years depending on model ( or something like that ) nope , it 's around 20 years , with modern ones expected to work for 30 + . 
  [ article 1 ] ( http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2329938/study-wind-turbines-remain-efficient-for-at-least-25-years ) [ article 2 ] ( http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/25/3325551/wind-turbines-durable/ ) [ article 3 confirming 1 ] ( http://orendaenergy.com/wind-turbine-life-span-new-study-confirms-25-years/ )  where you can easily upgrade it plenty of times . 
  no you ca n't . 
  in fact , upgrading a nuclear plant is something you entirely wo n't do because of the core 's radiation . 
  once its lifespan is over , it 's decomissioned ( and you pay top dollar for it ) and that 's it . 
  if you disagree , link sources to it . 
   sure a dam could be better/cheaper but still dams are poop : o dams are cooooooooooooooool !, 
  [ dams gone wild ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=dams&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=942&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bwmtvo7li-wq7aanpyhqba&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq )  a gen4 nuclear power plant would only have to store the waste matter for 900 ~ years , thats pretty clean considering it gets done deep in a mountain shaft where nobody visits anyway . 
  a generation 5-6 might take that waste and reduce it completely . 
  neither of those exist at the moment , and gen iv is expected ** not to exist ** for at least 30 more years . 
  who knows how muchrenewables will advance until then ? 
  i wonder why people assume inovation is only , or at least , mainly possible with nuclear power alone . 
   but it is bloody brilliant agreed  for the buck in most if not all categories . 
  disagreed . 
  and if you do n't mind , i 'll quote myself again :  quite funny coming from someone advocating nuclear power , where a single nuclear plant costs more than any conventional solar or wind plant . 
  initial construction of the nuclear facilities ** alone ** [ start at tenths of billions of dollars . 
  ] ( http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionc.htm#darlington ) do you have any idea how many wind turbines can you construct with 10 freaking billion dollars ? 
  so many that the peak power output is actually ** higher ** than a power plant . 
   not to mention the second part , which is decomissioning the plant once it 's life span is over . 
  [ that will only cost more $ 500 million dollars ] ( http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/decommissioning.html ) , and this is the ** typical cost ** , the median value . 
  i 'm excluding things like [ fukushima costs ' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety ) which are so high i wo n't even try to start an argument around this . 
   but , perhaps , you were referring to cost per kwh as the true assessment of nuclear 's cost . 
  fair enough . 
  in that case , [ here 's a graph citing 6 out of 7 studies which concluded that nuclear 's cost per kwh is actually more expensive than even traditional coal and gas ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/nuke%2c_coal%2c_gas_generating_costs.png ), 
   no pollution , waste is burned in newest reactors . 
  no it 's not . 
  citation here . 
   amount of fuel needed is extremely small and nuclear reactors produce less radiation than conventional coal power plants . 
  it 's still more radiation than renewables . 
  you say :  it 's the safest - the only accidents outside of russia took natural disasters combined with human mistakes but then :  renewables are great in principle , but they are [ ... ] and prone to causing accidental deaths . 
  when an accident with a renewable happens , a couple of people die because a turbine was caught on fire while they were doing maintenance , or a roofer falls 10 meters while installing a solar panel . 
  when a nuclear accident happens , cities become inhabitable waste lands out of a zombie apocalypse , food markets are shut or incapacitated for weeks until the threat has been dealt with and billions are spent on decommissioning the plant .

  things like chernobyl and fukushima happened and you have the nerve to say that renewables are `` prone '' to causing accidental deaths ? 
  without searching , tell me ** one ** accident involving a renewable source that was half as bad as either chernobyl , three miles island , or fukushima that caused comparable lost of human lives , comparable waste of land , comparable world disturbance ( economy , markets , etc ) , comparable monetary costs and most importantly , comparable social impact . 
  the fact that you ca n't should prove my point , but go on and search ; you wo n't find anything anywhere near the same magnitude , let alone half . 
   it 's the cheapest i 'll be damned if i get a source on this today !, 
  let me show good faith , here are two articles showing how one renewable source ( wind power ) drives energy prices down : [ article 1 ] ( http://aweablog.org/blog/post/wind-energy-blows-away-records-across-europe-driving-emissions-and-electricity-prices-down ) [ article 2 ] ( http://tcktcktck.org/2014/07/wind-declared-cheapest-energy-source-denmark/63626 ) now do the same for nuclear . 
   they are expensive quite funny coming from someone advocating nuclear power , where a single nuclear plant costs more than any conventional solar or wind plant . 
  initial construction of the nuclear facilities ** alone ** [ start at tenths of billions of dollars .

  their fuel is free !, 
  it 's focking free !, 
  the only resources you need is the metal necessary to build the turbine , or the solar plant 's mirrors , or the concrete 's dam , which you 'd need with any other power source . 
  you ca n't expect to have a working plant without that minimum `` resource '' investment , but after that you 're set !, 
  the sun shines for free , the wind blows for free , water goes downstream for free , gravity works for free . 
  remember how i cited you the costs of a nuclear power plant ? 
  [ here 's an article ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/19/markets/uranium/index.htm ) that shows that almost 30 % of a nuclear plant 's operating expenses come from it 's fuel , uranium . 
  and remember , uranium needs to be mined and refined much like traditional metal mining , or rare earth metal mining for photovoltaic panels . 
  then , it 's waste needs to be continuously dealt with , needs to be stored and cooled in a safe placed until we finally figure out what to do with it , something we 've been trying to do for the past 50 years , and do n't start throwing `` gen iv '' power plants for which not a single one exists yet . 
  now how is that for resource intensive ? 
   top of being surprisingly damaging to environment well colour me surprised ( pun intended ) and show me how and why is that . 
  until then , 8/8 bullshit . 
   do some research yourself and refrain from trying to silent others based on your ignorance . 
  i 've done my research , that 's the point . 
  i 've debated these issues before , that 's why i have to call people out when they spew bs . 
  yes , unfortunately society needs change before technology allows change to be made . 
  but hey , we can speculate !, 
  and we are the anti nuclear nutjobs . 
  sigh ...  renewables are n't environmentally friendly either is that an absolute statement ? 
  as if , renewables as a whole are n't environmentally friendly , or a specific aspect of a renewable energy source is n't environmentally friendly ? 
  it seemed the later to me . 
  you started well with `` intermittency is still a problem '' and screwed it with `` which often means that you need to fire up fossil generators '' . 
  who said itermittency has to be accomodated by fossil generators ? 
  why ca n't it be dealt with with other renewables like hydro ? 
  a modern renewable grid takes into account those factors ; when there 's little wind to power wind turbines there 's still the solar plants and the dams to fill in that energy gap , and vice-versa . 
  portugal , and other european countries like norway and denmark , are especially a good example of how renewable 's unpredictability can be dealt with . 
   renewables even today have n't reached the point where they can carry the kind of burden they do in france . 
  they sure are working towards it tho !, 
   they also have their own issues in regards to the mining of rare earth metals . 
  photovolteic panels do , not renewables as a whole . 
  then again , uranium needs to be mined aswell . 
   nuclear is the cleanest nope  safest nope  cheapest nope  and generally best form of generation of electricity . 
  aaaaand nope !,
