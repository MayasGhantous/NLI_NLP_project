  got attached to the bridge old chap ? 
  good point . 
  not even half , a fifth would amount significantly . 
  if a country with russia 's industry powered 50 % + of their energy with renewables it would be massive . 
  i did n't say there were relevant , they exist and that 's enough to put them in the map . 
   i bet germany ~ ~ and norway ~ ~ edit : for those who do n't understand , norway has great per capita renewable energy , but compared to germany they account a very small amount of the absolute total . 
  same goes for portugal and denmark . 
  reduced from 1800 energies to 1600 energies !, 
  if you go to lisbon make sure to pay a quick visit to coimbra ( roughly midway between porto and the capital ) and just before lisbon there 's [ sintra ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/sintra ) , which is just as amazing . 
  any other advice there 's plenty of travel guides online which could help you out more than i do . 
  enjoy the trip !, 
  re-read the title , i never said that they were actually going to be successful . 
  they exist , and that 's enough to put them on the map . 
  we are too shite to divide :(, 
  what 's bullshit about it ? 
  disclaimer : this map is 2 years old , and it 's all separatist movements , even the smallest , lesser known ones . 
  take it as you will also : portugal just chillin ' , and spain shatters into more pieces than prof x when jena kills him . 
  portugal does n't really have tourist traps , i can honestly say most places tourists go are worth visiting ( except perhaps the british colonies known as portim\u00e3o and vilamoura ) . 
  however , if you ever so slightly give a tourist vibe you will get scammed . 
  that coffee you ordered ? 
  that will be 2 euros . 
  ice cream ? 
  no change for your 5 euro note . 
  need a taxi ? 
  you 'll be paying a wheel 's price for that 5 kilometer ride . 
  pay attention to how much you spend and how much you 're being ordered to spend : call them out on it !, 
  other than that , have fun . 
  welp ... 
  try / r/portugal or / r/porto , they 're more specific and will probably yeld better results . 
  i 'll upload a map about this . 
   here are my 30 impressions of europe and europeans from my one year stay in belgium . 
   spain , belgium , italy and france all face secessionist movements which will damage their national interests and territorial integrity . 
  national interest trumps `` common interests '' . 
  they all have enormous reasons to prevent scotland re-entering the eu . 
   you do understand legal reality when you state : `` a new member state joining the eu requires treaty change . 
   the spanish who are blocking secession in the balkans ( kosovo ) , they have told you that they will do nothing to encourage the break up of spain . 
  the belgians feel the same way about the flemish . 
  so the arguments you have heard do bear analysis and are in no way sophistry . 
   you ask : `` how or why would scotland be cast out of the eu '' . 
  you will not be cast out you are leaving voluntarily : romano prodi , 10th president of the commission : `` a newly independent region would , by the fact of its independence , become a third country with respect to the union and the treaties would , from the day of its independence , not apply anymore on its territory . '', 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:c:2004:084e:0422:0423:en:pdf jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , 11th president of the commission says the same : http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/files/2014/02/scotland_and_the_eu_barrosos_reply_to_lord_tugendhat_101212-1.pdf jean-claude juncker , 12th president of the commission : `` mr van rompuy and mr barroso have already answered the questions about eu membership . 
  i have nothing to add . '', 
  http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28231347 that is how . 
   you claim : `` ensuring scotland 's continued membership of the eu is in the common interest ... the rest of the european union . '', 
  it might be in the snp 's best interest but it is certainly not in the interest of any state that wants to prevent itself being broken up by session . 
   the consequences of scotland not being an eu member : ( 1 ) 24 % import duty on manufactured goods to the eu ( including the uk for as long as it remains an eu member ) ( 2 ) obligatory international boarders , passport control , security control , anti-smuggling policing , money laundering controls under eu law ( at the northern border of the uk ) ( 3 ) loss of residency and working rights for scottish nationals in the eu ( and uk ) . 
   scotland is not only leaving nato but intentionally jeopardising one of its three independent nuclear deterrents while doing so ; you will be fighting nato if you attempt to prevent the very hungry spanish fishing your waters ( another reason spain will veto scotland re-entering the eu ) . 
   i think it is lost on the scottish ` yes ' voters quite how much trouble they are causing the rest of europe . 
  you are deluded if you think this will be a cost free exercise for scotland . 
  even if you vote ` no ' you have done irreparable generational damage to your international relationships . 
   your article is bereft of joined-up-thinking , it is self-contradictory and in places is just plain wrong . 
  it is evidence of quite how ill-informed the ` yes ' campaign has kept the scottish population . 
  i state it after all expenses , in which case is often a negative amount . 
  i wonder why they 're so eager to incorporate german 's previous fascist symbols and idiology instead of creating their own . 
  last surveys were really good and the data was presented in a very scientific way . 
  i do n't know if it was actually a mod who wrote the questions , anyway . 
  shhhhh just fill in the `` survey '' , completly usual , normal questions, 
  you do not know of our ways . 
  c2 portuguese and english b2 spanish, 
  i thought you could get it in the same way as the other flairs ... 
  anyway , ask the mods . 
   / r/europe only has flair for europeans countries i chose spain . 
  no way , seen dozens of canadians , us and australian flairs . 
  flair up, 
  o-okay ... things did change in the week i 'm gone ... 
  what the heck ? 
  did anyone listen to the entire thing ? 
  there are authentic gems coming from the audience . 
  been there , done that !, 
  more like they had a private conversation and barroso said something himself that will backfire if the call is released . 
  [ source 1 ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3202958,00.html ) [ source 2 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4627862.stm ) [ source 3 ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/chirac-shifts-french-doctrine-for-use-of-nuclear-weapons/1956 ) [ source 4 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/ar2006011903311.html ) france does n't fuck around , neither does europe . 
   they could just do terrorist attacks , i mean , it 's not like they lack for european passports terrorist attacks = nukes from france . 
  $ 35000/year is roughly 2000 euros / month , that 's 4x the minimum wage in portugal . 
  if you do n't live in any major city ( porto , lisbon ) you can live like a king . 
  dafuq is ameriatralia ? 
  damn norwegians stealing our spotlight !, 
  anywho , judging by the current rate of things in portugal id predict close to 100 percent of 2014s energy production will come from renewables . 
  coast cities and south poland are stocked . 
  tell me about it ... 
  exactly , recording and seeding , whatever ... 
  selling it and profiting from it yourself ? 
  good riddance . 
  dafuq is this content ? 
  downvoted . 
  just in the same way france borders brazil . 
  problem is another continent does n't start when those countries ' borders end . 
  european by definition means being in europe ** geographically ** . 
  literally , it 's the only requirement . 
  now one might argue if they share european values , or better said , values that countries that are in europe often have and , because of that , are said to be european . 
  european union european europe, 
  no friend , this is iceland you speak of . 
   actually , the problem there is that the poorer countries were affected by communism for a long time . 
  not true . 
  source : portugal . 
  i want to live in the yacht off the coast ... 
  the prince/king/whoever owns the place personally forgave her `` sins '' ( he has the authority to do that ) and she was free to go or stay if she so desired . 
  she left the country . 
  my serious answer is that this has not been asked yesterday . 
   if we use 0.3 usd for the price of a kwh dafuq ?
