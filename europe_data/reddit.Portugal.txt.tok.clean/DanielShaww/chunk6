  `` everytime somebody tell me joke about latvia i say ` no friend this is iceland you speak of '' !, 
  p o r t u g a l, 
  i laughed so much when i read cars and car parts . 
  it 's like we 're hank hill or something . 
  / r/europe, 
  the only thing to rethink is how big the wall surrounding that country needs to be .

   what advice do you have for a foreigner coming to your continent ? 
  here 's the issue , we are in the same continent but are different in many aspects . 
  x-post this to / r/italy and they 'll help you a ton . 
  `` i 'm so buff swedish cops arrested me on sight , ama '', 
  itt : redditors nulify russia 's sanctions on lithuania by buying its products . 
  we did it reddit !, 
  you underestimate europe 's military power . 
  yes . 
  same as dialing 112, 
  this is like a thief calling 911 . 
  more * wealthy * old people . 
  there 's the difference . 
  that was because of napoleon . 
  not before we kicked the shit out of the spanish first . 
  but after that yeah , downhill . 
  do they ? 
  what for ? 
  can you prove it ? 
  uhhg not good at explaining jokes . 
  basically the work `` fiat '' is what our current money system ( euro , dollar , etc ) is . 
  fiat is leaving italy , so it can accept cryptocurrency ( e.g bitcoin ) , which is an internet created currency . 
  italy may finally accept bitcoin . 
  i 'm not . 
  our taxi drivers already had the `` fame '' of doing this , but i had to actually see it to believe it . 
  last year in porto i met a chinese tourist who was looking to go to the pal\u00e1cio da bolsa . 
  it was pretty late that night and i was in a hurry to get home from college , so i told her to just pick a quick cab ( it was a 2 minute drive at most ) , and she said they 'd make her pay far more than she could afford . 
  i ended up just walking her there with a friend . 
  but my 450 euros example actually comes from this year 's mundialito in espinho where the us team were . 
  i know a driver who said he charged that much to take one us player from the airport to espinho then back after they got eliminated . 
  that 's a 40 kilometer journey , 450 . 
  almost 10 euros per kilometer . 
  if you are a tourist then portuguese cab drivers will snif you from a mile away and enter `` super charge '' mode.taxi drivers know tourists usually have the money , are out of their confort zone ( more likely to pay just to avoid making a scene or changing plans ) and are na\u00efve to `` normal '' portuguese prices . 
  result is paying 450 euros to do 2 trips of 20 km each ( 40 total ) . 
  portugal ( what the fuck are you doing here anyway ? 
  srsly , spain is just next door ) ** do n't ** say gracias ** do n't ** take a cab ** do ** have fun, 
  the albania one was awesome . 
  ladies and gentlemen , from not-biased-city , i present you the greatest anthem in the world : [ portuguese anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqjdtkwnf60 ), 
  that bird and the flag ^ ^, 
   no other european country possess a network of former colonies of comparable size and power to the uk hue, 
  hey , you 've got an awesome parlament !, 
  damn right . 
  getting hungry just by looking at that . 
  also , if you ever visit portugal only ask for a francesinha if you 're in the north ( porto , aveiro , to some extent coimbra ) . 
  best francesinhas come from there . 
  i have a massive hard on for anything swedish , so there 's that . 
  there 's an option to set your flair, 
  `` right through berlin '', 
  the flags are chosen by the users silly :p, 
  fox news target audience is the one who believes we need a `` save the homeland '' day . 
  why do catalonians want independence so badly ? 
  what will they gain by being a country ? 
  they hit an airplane randomly . 
  i 'm not saying it 's an odds game , but the reasoning behind `` they already brought down a plane , they would n't do it again '' unsettles me . 
  a large majority of people still side with putin . 
  your opinion alone is not representative of all of ukraine . 
  it was unheard of that rebels would have buk missiles until they , in their terminal stupidity , actually hit a freaking 777 out of the sky and bragged about it on twitter thinking they 'd hit a military jet . 
  this will sound exagerated , but for all i care they could have nukes . 
  there 's a reason every major airline just does n't go into ukraine , and perhaps turkey should think the same . 
  they will be safer anywhere where there is n't military conflict , period . 
  it 's reckless to do what they are doing . 
   local media said that the dj kicked off his set with dire straits ' `` sultans of swing '' i thought they were trying to drive them out . 
  remember remember the 5th of november ... 
  violence goes both ways . 
  dafuq did i just read ? 
  if you are visiting europe for a period as long as 6 months then staying in a single country seems a waste . 
  use !, 
  use !, 
  can you link the video ? 
  i do n't know , that 's one good looking flag . 
  they were n't nearly the most voted party . 
  what 's your point ? 
  doing good . 
  funny , the country that benefits the less from an european union , given it 's size and power , is the proudest of showing it . 
  france , you rock . 
   for the time being , our only real options for power generation are fossil fuels and nuclear .

  what `` change '' are you expecting to find in europe ? 
  it 's not my call to decide what to do !, 
  i 'm not a politician , i agree with you . 
  something should be done and other central european countries should be more active . 
   why would n't other countries help , if asked ? 
  i do n't know , perhaps they do n't think it 's necessary for them to do anything . 
  immigration is not the biggest issue * per se * , it 's just a debatable one . 
  spain , italy and greece have been doing a fine job of stopping north african emmigrants from getting in , plus they are way more experienced in that regard than , say , germany or france , who never had to deal with the issue . 
  we do , just different priorities . 
  not really , italy threatened to let all the immigrants in if they do n't get help from the rest of eu . 
  i 'm sorry , what do you mean with `` biology '' ? 
  wtf sweden ? 
  you were the chosen country !!!, 
  europe 's pride and beautiful women ...
