  here in portugal those are illegal next to major cities . 
  `` stockholm is no longer composed of the inner city and the suburb , but the inner city , suburbs , and slums . '', 
  can any fellow swedish confirm this ? 
  definitely different issues . 
  glad we had that sorted out , though . 
  have a nice day . 
  rather late reply of mine but it was supposed to answer your question as to why you get downvoted when saying turkey is n't a part of europe . 
  my response was meant to highlight that perhaps it 's not your opinion but rather the undelicate you way you talk about an entire country that brings them downvotes . 
  because of  corrupt shitholes to the eu, 
  russians , lots of russians !, 
  at least you 're human ... 
  hey !,

  congratulations on the baby . 
  i 'm surprised by ireland : formerly part of the uk , left , joined the eu , joined the euro , was hit by a big crisis , and still no major exit movements like those from britain , not even exit from the euro . 
  rather surprising , really . 
  yes , the uk would be more powerful than japan outside the eu . 
  that passive income better last for at least the next decade , should you really decide to move . 
  i 'm curious , of all portugal , what made you choose aveiro ? 
  they found out this was where the cool kids hanged out . 
  schuman did n't die for this . 
  some are more diverse than others .

  hopefully does n't take as long as the survey we were meant to have 300k subscribers ago . 
  `` comes out '', 
  i think fullfilling the collective wish of their people is something worth hoping for . 
   those are all retired brits to be fair , who have inflated property prices and are draining a free healthcare service that they 've never contributed for . 
  i want farage . 
  is there a way for stocks to rise consistently and not be a bubble ? 
  welp , portuguese 's out aswell, 
  they 're europe 's finnest , would be a huge blow to the eu if they left .

  sweet damn what a beautiful comment . 
  i 'd just like to add that i only know the pnr and i recall having seen a banner of theirs that pictured an airplane taking off with the writing `` send them [ foreigners ] back home '' in it . 
  needless to say , portugal is n't very attractive to foreigners who 'd need to be forcily sent home . 
   have to split up the oceans at least . 
  been there , done that . 
  nice, 
  you have 2.93 gun related death / 100k people , that 's higher than all european countries except finland , croatia , france and austria . 
   we have one of the lowest gun homicide actually , your gun homicide rate is 3x times higher than other european countries . 
  been surrounded by europeans all day at work . 
  truly a good day !, 
  next time a brit rants about the unelected bureaucrats of the eu i 'll show him this . 
  i know that the eu parliament has an ** official ** subreddit / r/europeanparliament probably managed by interns , though . 
   frequently asked questions in a major diplomatic victory for the uae , emiratis will need only a valid passport to enter any of the schengen countries . 
  the uae is the first arab country , second in the middle east , and third among islamic countries whose citizens receive this visa waiver . 
  here are some of faqs on visa-free travel for emiratis to schengen countries . 
  ** q : when does visa-free travel for emiratis start ? 
  ** from may 7 , uae nationals can visit 34 european countries without obtaining a visa prior to the travel date . 
  ** q : what does the visa-free travel to europe mean for emiratis ? 
  ** it means an emirati traveller needs only to produce a valild passport at the host country 's airport . 
  he will then be allowed to stay for 90 uninterrupted days , or 6 months with interruption . 
  ** q : when was the visa-free travel for emiratis granted by the eu ? 
  ** the proposal to grant the uae schengen visa-free status was passed by the european parliament in june 2014 , with 523 out of 577 votes . 
  ** q : how many flight are there between the uae and europe ? 
  ** there are 500 airline trips a week between the uae and eu and these figures will most likely increase as travel restrictions are lifted . 
  several thousand emiratis visit europe throughout the year . 
  last year , italy alone granted about 10,000 visas for emiratis at both their abu dhabi and dubai diplomatic mission out of the 35,000 visas approved in the uae . 
  with the visa-waiver , the number of emirati tourists to europe is expected to increase dramatically . 
  ** q : which european countries will uae citizens be allowed visa-free travel ? 
  ** uae citizens will be allowed access to 34 european countries ( including 28 schengen states ) . 
  the schengen area member states are : austria , belgium , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland ( not an eu state ) , italy , latvia , liechtenstein ( not a european union member state ) , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , netherlands , norway ( not an eu member state ) , poland , portugal , slovakia , slovenia , spain , sweden and switzerland ( not a eu state ) . 
  ** q : what happens in emergencies ? 
  ** citizens need to coordinate with the uae missions in these countries to negotiate longer stays . 
  ** q : what if an emirati citizen is accompanied by non-emiratis ? 
  ** if you are accompanied by non-emirati citizens , make sure to obtain a schengen visa for them before travelling . 
  ** q : how big is the trade been the uae and eu states ? 
  ** based on eu data , trade between the 28 members of the eu states and the uae rose in 2012 by 9.7 per cent year-on-year and hit $ 45.4 billion . 
  trade connections with european countries today is tipping the $ 50 billion ( dh205 billion ) point .

  damn, 
  it just so happens that that tiny minority owns 99.9 % of all the country 's wealth . 
  africa 's richest woman amongst them . 
  you 've made europe a great honour . 
  they might not know who the first was , but that `` dumb '' girl named 3 american presidents ( granted , arguably the most iconic ) , when most americans would find difficult to name even a single one of our european equivelent . 
   something tells me the eu number would be significantly lower if we did n't count the brits .
