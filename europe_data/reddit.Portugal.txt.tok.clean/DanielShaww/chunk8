  that 's like removing mississipi from us statistics , not really fair . 
  good one with farage . 
  3 holy weeks a year keep the atheist away . 
  there 's programming languages everyone loves , and there 's languages that are actually useful . 
  yes , like cyprus . 
  norway , switzerland and iceland, 
  [ hand it over ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_ceuta ), 
  yes i 'd mind , apart from the stuborn 3 i think eu expansion should be put on hold for the next 25 years .

  you just gave / r/european an aneurism . 
  because it is a tireless argument . 
  germany is a very experienced country in this regard : at one point they had the most amount of nuclear , then of coal and now of both solar ( impressive ) and wind . 
  they 've tried their hand at pretty much anything , and they 've made their choice for the present and the future of the country 's electricity generation . 
  there are several reasons for a country not to nuclear , especially one like germany - safety : nuclear is ** generally ** safe , but it has a lot of variance . 
  what that means is that when things go wrong , things can go veeeeeery wrong , and we 've seem this happen already twice in the last 30 years . 
  just because technology advances , does n't mean that we should n't consider the worst case scenario , and the worst case scenario for a nuclear plant is extremely bad . 
  now contextualize it in a densely populated country like germany , then put in the middle of western/central europe and now connect it to the biggest synchronous grid in the world and you can see the disaster potential increase ten fold . 
  and [ do n't fool yourself if you think critical mistakes are a thing of the past ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-nuclear-strategy-faces-meltdown-as-faults-are-found-in-identical-french-project-10186163.html ) - ** price ** : nuclear technology is now +60 years old and still is expensive as f * uck . 
  even worse , not only is nuclear expensive before the construction even begins ( the budget ) , in practice they 're even more expensive because if you look at the most recent nuclear plants built in europe ( one in france and one in finland ) not only are they delayed , they 're 3x times above their predicted budget !, 
  these are plants that are being built right now in opposite ends of europe by countries who know nuclear and it has gone bad for the taxpayer , and they have n't produced a single kwh of electricity yet . 
  and it gets even worse : nuclear is so expensive that no project can be privately funded , all nuclear plants need a majority of their funding from the state they are built in and more often than not it also needs the investment of foreign companies for the project to even be considered . 
  but wait , we are n't finished yet !, 
  because a nuclear disaster can be so devastating , especially in the financial sense of the word , they are uninsurable . 
  that means that no private entity agrees to take financial responsability in case things go south . 
  who takes financial responsability then ? 
  ask japan and their $ 500 billion fukushima decomission price tag . 
  is the government that is paying that , and each of the 120 million people living there . 
  now ask yourself a question : if nuclear is indeed so safe , why is it uninsurable ? 
  - ** energy independence ** : germany ( eastern germany ) used to be a uranium power house . 
  now it is n't , the uranium is gone . 
  that means germany will have to import their fuel to run the plants . 
  that means an exposure to market fluctuations , embargos and other factors . 
  there 's a very strong argument for having a built-in energy system , from the mine all the way to the household . 
  in germany , that does n't exist . 
  - ** time ** : i wrote how nuclear is expensive , but the time it takes to get a nuclear plant going is ludicrous . 
  hinkley point c is a npp that was started being built last year in the uk . 
  it is expected to be finished by 2023 ( based on other npp deadlines , i give it a 5 % chance of actually being finished by then ) . 
  that is , at the very least , an entire decade of development and construction before a single kwh comes out . 
  and what 's funny is that by then , solar is expected to have dropped by another 50 % , and wind by 30 % . 
  by the time the plant is finished , solar and wind will make it financially obsolete !, 
  - ** eu targets ** : quite simply , 20 % of germany 's energy must be from renewable sources by 2020 . 
  nuclear is n't renewable , thus any investment there is money that could have gone to meet these targets and is n't . 
  - ** among other factors ** that only research and study can clarify . 
  depending on the steroids , it is not a rumour . 
  3 horse power . 
   / r/dateisbeautiful [ indeed ] ( https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/mktg/assets/image/calendar.jpg ), 
  quite funny , the best plan the eu could have to prevent a brexit would be to have france threatening to kick the uk out . 
  are we really going to have this argument ?

  `` damn it feels good to be a gangster . '', 
   six months after stepping down as european commission president , jose manuel barroso claims he no longer has to be careful about what he says . 
  o-okay ? 
  so do australians , have you considered them ? 
  remember to sort by `` controversial '' guys !, 
  that 's really interesting , you should create a thread with that . 
  i want to be * you * . 
  please find enclosed my uk membership bid . 
  holy moly the baltics have gotten us beat !, 
  really ? 
  not only that , but most companies that gibraltar has rely on its eu membership . 
  needless to say , if gibraltar leaves the eu , so will said companies . 
  to their credit ... 
  i do n't think i 've ever personally witnessed racism . 
  however , i 've heard some xenophobic comments . 
  `` lol this week '' - certain french guy, 
  we did it europe !, 
  to which speed ? 
  that of the light ? 
  if we could , it would have infinite energy , because no material with mass can go at the speed of light . 
  i have no strong feelings one way or the other . 
  6.5 tev is approximately ~ 7x the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito . 
  it is not much energy per say , but when applied to single atomic or subatomic particles it is enough to accelerate them to a speed very close of that of light ( 300 000 km/s ), 
  guys , you probably should n't have sent so many ... 
  i do n't know , i do n't work for the eu . 
  originally i read it as new york and thought `` jeez , this group must have a field day there ... '' . 
  my bad , it was just the uk !, 
  the eu has a lot to say when both independent countries wish to be part of it . 
  propaganda is not logical . 
  my friend , greece 's very own finance minister , yanis varoufakis , answers your question : [ what if greece left the euro ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3unigdmqwi&amp;t=1h08m15s ), 
  god damn , this is such a good comment . 
  talk to admins if you can do it yourself . 
  that is , if you 're so inclined to do so . 
  we were supposed to have one 8 months ago when the sub reached 100k . 
  now we 're over 300k and still going fast , the mod responsible for it abandoned the project and now we 're left with nothing . 
  it is quite a shame because being a bit of a stats nerd i love the information that could be collected from a / r/europe survey . 
  this comment section will be interesting . 
  funny that you said that , because depending on how old you are some capitals might not have existed when you learnt them . 
  funny that you of all people would be interviewed for a eu entity . 
  one size does not fit all of the uk in regards to the eu either , you can expect a withdrawl to desintegrate the union . 
  stealing our healthcare , gentrifying our neighbourhoods , creating their own communities . 
  definitely . 
  or that he was a double `` agent '' for portugal . 
  sure , i 'll discover india under a super duper secret mission which is worth hundreds of tons of gold , spicies and influence for whichever nation funds such trip ( spain ) , but of course i must immediately see the portuguese king upon arrival , and only then speak with the spanish monarchs about my findings . 
  not * de jure * , but certainly * de facto * . 
  and switzerland , san marino , andorra and vatican city . 
  which is ironic , since most people would n't be able to afford a roof in norway to start with . 
  unite greece and turkey and this is perfect . 
  the mere thought of this map is enough to start a third war .
