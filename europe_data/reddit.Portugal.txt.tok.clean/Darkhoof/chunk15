  why are you acting like spoiled children all of a sudden ? 
  not really ... before we had respect for most of the british . 
  now we have respect for a minority of them . 
  this guy would be a comedy if he was n't in the most powerful position in the world . 
  but hey , there 's a bunch of american retards that think this guy is a good representative of their country . 
  whatever . 
  and ignoring that untill recently opel was from gm . 
  and that ford sells a lot in europe . 
  salt ? 
  because the americans elected a fat orange clown to represent them ? 
  no , no . 
  you misunderstand . 
  we laugh at the americans . 
  french never left the world . 
  you guys are the beacon of hope , liberty and enlightnment in europe . 
  pity that so many fn supporters do n't have the perception of how big and important france is right now . 
  germany called me a cool kid ?? 
  oh , how times have changed . 
  and that 's bad because ... france has nukes . 
  make an european nuclear defense stockpile from those to guarantee european defense without depending on the us . 
  nope . 
  eventually oliven\u00e7a will be ours again . 
  maybe in 200 years when spain splinters again in multiple nations and we recover it when no one notices it . 
  as this map shows we can wait a long time . 
  but we need to contain our euphoria . 
  we already have plenty of experience of things turning to shit after seemingly going great . 
  yeah , i 'm skeptical about that ... 
  the eu knows plenty of countries do n't want to be in the euro . 
  deeper eurozone means tighter integration between eurozone members . 
  not expand to different ones . 
  no one can force sweden to be in the eurozone if you do n't apply to it . 
  so you guys are also getting hit by fake news uh ? 
  from the latest polls they 're still far away from an absolute majority . 
  i can see them just needing be or pcp in the next elections , but it 's still so far away that there 's plenty of time for things to go wrong . 
  lets just be patient . 
  we need to be frugal with our money , he can catch the subway from santa apol\u00f3nia !, 
  you guys are doing pretty well for yourselves already . 
  haha , you 're fat . 
  are you sure ? 
  there 's a few hollywood movies showing otherwise . 
  it 's not a stated goal , but with this move he wants to steal votes from them . 
  ( edit . 
  well , apparently he spoke about it on french tv ? 
  lol ), 
  your optimism is contagious !, 
  go to galicia , they 're portuguese in disguise . 
  ahead of norway and other nordic countries in an actually meaningful indicator . 
  what the fuck is going on ?? 
  spain did too . 
  as did portugal and greece and cyprus . 
  yeah , they try to portray themselves as british because being portuguese gives a negative perception . 
  i need to read up a bit more where they actually started because i think it was in my home town . 
  do n't ask him questions . 
  he does n't answer those , and he 's afraid we want to steal his monies . 
  nooo , they love us so much they always want us to join them . 
  if you equate social spending with spending stupidly i wo n't even argue with you because you 're an extremist . 
  have a nice day . 
  those are full year proejctions . 
  as i mentioned the first semester will see much stronger growth than the second one because the first half of 2016 was weak . 
  it will probably average out at the end of the year to 1.8 % . 
  quality of life is the endgame bro . 
  good public health systems for everyone ( without exclusion for monetary reasons ) , solid education systems for your kids , fair labour laws , etc. 
  & nbsp ; therefore , you need to have a ** balance ** between social spending and economic policies to boost growth . 
  if you do n't agree go live in countries like china because there you have plenty of economic growth yet most of the population lives like crap . 
  or you should 've lived in portugal in the 60 's and 70 's . 
  i bet you would 've loved to live in a fiscally responsible country where the vast majority of the population only had 4 years of education , no national health system and rampant child mortality rates . 
  but hey , we had no deficits , barely any public debt and strong industry ( with barely any social and environmental regulation ) . 
  those were the days ... / s & nbsp ; infrastructure spending is only efficient up to a point when you already have enough infrastructure built . 
  then infrastructure spending just becomes a venue for corruption ( which was what happened in portugal after a point when the eu just keep shoving money into infrastructure money when portugal already had good infrastructure ) . 
  therefore you need ** balance ** . 
  which is something that you are not understanding about my position . 
  i ** never ** said that europe should be fiscally irresponsible . 
  there is space to accomodate a lot fo demands and make things work better for everyone . 
  you are the one that fails to understand that and wants to disregard the majority of the eurozone population because of your ideological beliefs . 
  so be it . 
  the best deal is the deal where neither side leaves entirely happy with the outcome . 
  netherlands also loves to use fiscal subterfuges to receive tax money from other eu countries so i wo n't even talk about those weasels . 
  portugal lost a lot of companies taxable income who moved their fiscal headquarters to netherlands . 
  and you did n't answer my question . 
  why are n't you worried about the interests of the other net contributors ? 
  if they eurozone is n't benefitial for most net contributor countries they 'll contributions will decrease . 
  everyone will get less money when that happens . 
  spending on pensions and social security increases the quality of life of the general population . 
  it also increases private consumption which is a tool for economic growth ( which should n't be abused , agreed ) . 
  because if people have more disposable income they 'll spend more in goods . 
  and you may not be aware but there was a time when the eu paid incentives to portugal to dismantle a bunch of our industries and to increase our private consumption . 
  & nbsp ; maybe france and italy should stop contributing to the eu budget then to control their public spending . 
  i would love to see how that would affect estonia and if your dear germany would pick up the tab . 
  & nbsp ; i wo n't even argue about keynesianism with you . 
  i mostly agree with that . 
  spending must be done responsibly and not in stupid amounts . 
  but you are completely blind if you do n't see there 's a difference between responsible spending ( spend within your means ) and irresponsible spending ( out of your means ) . 
  when they have the budgetary leeway to do it responsibly and are getting eu funds , they can do it . 
  if france , italy and spain want to have their voice heard germany will have to make concessions . 
  as for germany making other countries have their voices heard , the same can be said of france , italy and spain . 
  ** but i wonder , why are n't you concerned about the interests of the net contributors that also give money to estonia , france and italy ? 
  why are you just so worried with germany ? 
  ** & nbsp ; france and italy will make portugal , greece , cyprus , malta , ireland and even belgium voices heard . 
  and what 's that ? 
  there are another 35 million people in those other countries that also do not benefit with the current eurozone rules versus the 14 million of eastern countries ?
