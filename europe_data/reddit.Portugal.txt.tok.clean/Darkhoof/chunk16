  & nbsp ; hmmmm , i wonder who has more weight in these negotiations ? 
  because trust me , there will be negotiations . 
  but hey !, 
  they now have a surplus right ?? 
  that 's what we were talking about . 
  if they ca n't spend money and their private sector is destroyed this is exactly what happens . 
  & nbsp ; their budget is now controlled . 
  i do agree with you they did some massively stupid shit in the previous years , including forging numbers to get into the eurozone . 
  something that no other country did . 
  but does the population deserve the suffering inflicted on them because they could only choose between corrupt politicians ? 
  & nbsp ; anyway , this isnt about greece . 
  it 's about spain , who was n't rescued by the eu nor the imf . 
  and they deserve to have their voice heard and have the clout to demand changes . 
  just as italy and france have . 
  public debt emission is a tool that almost every nation state in the world uses . 
  and you can have public deficits every year as long as your economy gdp grows more than what you spend . 
  that way your debt goes down and the deficit wo n't matter if it 's lower than gdp growth ( in estonia 's case ) . 
  & nbsp ; considering that you are well below what is required you could increase spending for decades before having to implement cuts if you did it responsibly and you would probably trigger further growth that way that could compensate for that spending . 
   also we can clearly see that european union is going to move into direction where bigger countries get more power and smaller countries get less say than they have now . 
  as you said `` tough luck because you are small '' indeed . 
  i can say tough luck as well - ca n't compete with germany ? 
  tough luck . 
  & nbsp ; you have n't been in the eu for long so i 'll just tell that it 's always been that way . 
  small countries interests have much less weight and always had . 
  and competing with germany ? 
  if the rules of the eurozone benefit more germany while italy and france are having problems ( when they 're also net contributors with a bigger population ) they can and deserve to have the rules adjusted to be more fair to them . 
  because in case you do n't know , the rules of the eu and eurozone have changed and evolved along the decades to have into consideration the interests of its member states . 
  & nbsp ;  per capita estonia recieves more than spain but by total amount not . 
  also estonia is expected to become net contributor some time in 2020s so do n't worry . 
  yeah , you are a country of 1.3 million that received 500 million euros from 2007-2013 while spain , which is a country of 46 million received 3,000 million euros in the same period . 
  interesting differences per capita no ? 
  & nbsp ;  i 'd like to improve eurozone and i would not be against closer fiscal union but this would mean that we would have to implement very strict rules when it comes to budget deficits , public spending and everything fiscally related because countries would be a lot more dependent on others than they are now . 
  this would also mean there there have to be punishments so if a country breaks even one rule then they should be thrown out immediately . 
  & nbsp ; and i want strict rules that have flexibility in moments of extraordinary crisis to allow for flexibility instead of punishing populations when they most need help . 
  and from what i 've read that 's the direction that these talks seem to be directed at . 
  with alqueva there 's been a small agricultural and touristic boom in alentejo . 
  they also opened up more areas of the alentejo coast to construction ( which is not a good thing imo ) . 
  & nbsp ; we also have a big vw factory south of lisbon . 
  i am personally hoping that tesla will pick portugal for their gigafactory ( but it will most likely be in spain ) . 
  textiles and shoemaking actually became competitive because they stopped competing in price and moved on to compete in high-end fashion . 
  also farfetch is an e-commerce bliion dollar unicorn company that started in guimar\u00e3es and they are growing exponentially . 
  shhhh , do n't mention that or you 'll jinx it . 
  go check again the budget numbers of greece . 
  you will be surprised . 
  they have a budget surplus and heavily slashed their social benefits . 
  & nbsp ; but your countryman seems to be especially resentful with the social model followed by greece and other southern european countries . 
  a social model that was promoted by the eu prior to the baltic states entrance and prior to these hard rules on public debt and deficits . 
   germany has the biggest population and biggest economy in the european union but their economy is not big enough to carry everyone . 
  germany is already one of the biggest contributors to the european union when talking about money so they are doing their part . 
  we also have to take into consideration that united kingdom is leaving and that creates a hole that needs to be filled in the eu budget . 
  it is expected that germany pays the missing part . 
  there is only so much you can ask from germany before their population turns against european union because there is a breaking point somewhere . 
  germany wo n't pay the missing part . 
  everyone will pay the missing part , but also eu funds to the uk will be spread out among other countries . 
  & nbsp ; also i do n't understand why do you want to imply that i 'm saying that germany has to carry everyone . 
  i ** never ** said that germany has to carry everyone . 
  each country contributes as they can . 
  even portugal contributes with funds . 
  we may be net recipients but we also give our portion to the eu budget . 
  & nbsp ; spain may be a net beneficiary now ( there was a short period of time when it became a contributor instead but then the crisis came ) but there are certain spanish regions that are actually contributors or are not beneficiaries . 
  & nbsp ; and if you check the net contributions per capita , estonia receives infinitely more than spain . 
  and since you seem to be completely fixated on germany 's contributions lets also make it clear that ** the southern countries that you so clearly loathe are also net contributors . 
  italy is a net contributor . 
  france is a net contributor . 
  ** in fact , france contributes more than the uk and italy will become the 3rd biggest contributor after the uk leaves . 
  since you are so worried about it , maybe they should stop contributing to estonia . 
  after all , you are fiscally responsible . 
  why do you need eu money again ? 
  & nbsp ; since you are seemingly so worried about the contributors rights there you have two contributors who are southern european , with a combined population of 130 million people and that want to change the way the eurozone works . 
  so think about that and instead of being such a german fanboy consider the rights of those contributing nations and the fact that the eu institutions exist to serve their populations as well and not just germany and 14 million people spread out between minor countries . 
  & nbsp ; and while you show `` solidarity '' to southern european countries ( even though you keep rubbing that in our faces ) you ignore that france and italy are the biggest eurozone economies after germany , net contributors and they want to change the eurozone rules . 
  so yeah , estonia does n't like some things ? 
  tough luck . 
  your weight is minuscule compared with france , italy or spain . 
  & nbsp ; and please elaborate on how improving the way the eurozone works is `` bad '' for estonia . 
  because i still do n't understand why you think so . 
  increase your public spending in social benefits then . 
  it 's not the fault of the southern european countries that your governments do n't provide decent social benefits to the population nor try to create a decent social state like what you have in scandinavian countries . 
  & nbsp ; since you are so fiscally responsible and have next to no public debt , while you can go a limit of 60 % , i do n't see why you do n't improve your social safety net because you clearly can . 
  you like to think yourselves nordic ? 
  look at the scandinavian social safety nets and emulate that . 
  & nbsp ; also those differences between greece and estonia are easily explainable historically . 
  greece has been in the eu for a really long time and yu have n't , hence they have better benefits because there was a time ( of which apparently estonians are n't aware ) when the eu * did n't give a flying fuck about public spending and public debt * . 
   why i have a feeling that germany is expected to pay for most of the euro-bonds , anti-crisis budgets and unemployment insurances . 
  & nbsp ; because germany is the biggest economy and has the biggest population of the eurozone . 
  eurozone rules dictate that contributions are proportional to the population and economy of each country . 
  this is not new , as opposed to estonia belonging in this club . 
  historically , contributions from rich countries to poor countries have been the norm - it 's called ** european solidarity ** for something - and i think it was the reason you joined the eu and you joined the eurozone . 
  not because it imposed draconian fiscal rules . 
   also i have a feeling that when spain talks about rich northern europe and poor southern europe that they only talk about western european countries because it completely ignores what is going on in eastern europe . 
  & nbsp ; ** spain did n't talk about rich northern european and poor southern europe anywhere in that article . 
  that 's you putting words in their mouth because of your own bias . 
  ** and they are talking about ** eurozone ** reforms , not eu reforms , so it wo n't affect most eastern countries . 
  the eastern countries in the eurozone are the baltic countries , slovenia and slovakia . 
  all together they have a population of 14 million people . 
  ** spain has a population of 46 million , is one of the biggest economies in europe and also one of the fastest growing economies so they deserve to have a bigger voice than all eastern countries put together . 
  just as italy who has an even bigger population and is a net contributor while their economy is going down the drain . 
  ** & nbsp ; i 'll turn this question back around : why do n't the eastern countries of the eurozone show solidarity to the southern countries since you also have small economies and are therefore more vulnerable to external shocks ? 
  & nbsp ; http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2013/04/on-japans-widowmaker-trade-and-reinhart-and-rogoff/ also spain public debt ( as well as as ireland 's ) pre-crisis were around the 60 % rule ( i did n't read the text just wanted to show you the graphs with public debt of spain pre-crisis ) . 
  something that you have constantly ignored in the past .
