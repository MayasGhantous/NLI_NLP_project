  is it that hard to understand that the eurozone needs rules and mechanisms that ** have ** to be flexible enough to take into account extraordinary economic crisis ? 
  & nbsp ; also , since you seem to have a prejudice against southern europe i would advise you to wash your mouth when you talk about spain . 
  they ** were not ** rescued by the imf or the european institutions . 
  they had the fastest growth of the big economies of the eurozone and a controlled deficit and public debt . 
  even then , they suffered hard with the crisis . 
  the portuguese economy grew 2.8 % in the first trimester of 2017 compared with the first trimester of 2016 . 
  the growth compared with the last trimester of 2016 was 1 % . 
  & nbsp ; this was the best growth in a trimester since 2007 and was obtained through growth in investment and increases in exports with compensated a decrease of the importance of private consumption to the growth figures . 
  & nbsp ; all in all , good news . 
  however , these high numbers are also a consequence of the stagnation of the portuguese economy in the first trimester of 2016 , so the numbers look better than what they probably are . 
  most likely , the same effect will be seen in the second trimester . 
  however , in the second half of the year economic growth compared with the previous year will be slower because the economy picked up in the second semester of 2016 . 
  just start saying/writing caralho , foda-se at the end of each sentence and consider yourself annexed . 
  and we gave 12 points to azerbeijan after armenia gave us their 12 points . 
  my armenian friend was not happy about that at all . 
   part 4/4 portugal already won and the video starts with a really funny and slightly creepy glitch damn , that beginning was like a bad acid trip . 
  or is zeman , trump on steroids ? 
  ( i do n't know anything about what 's going with my czechbros just trying to keep a chain going ), 
  13th of may , the day of our lady of f\u00e1tima . 
  guess she wanted to have fun in a day off . 
  you 're joking but they want to invite portugal and spain ... 
  hahahaha, 
  yes , but we did it after . 
  they provoked us into doing this ( not really ) . 
  i also never thought i would see portugal loose to the us at football yet we last the two times we faced them in the world cup . 
  i think italy will say yes , since this would be mostly benefitial to them . 
  spain as well . 
  the netherlands though ... 
  considering they talk about fiscal harmonization i think netherlands will say `` hell no '' . 
  they got to keep their nar fiscal haven status somehow to continue ripping other eurozone members . 
  yeah , when i went to sweden i was surprised by how much you guys loved the eurovision contest ... 
  i could see them losing constantly to the us and mexico . 
  it 's funny how the friendzone speech transcends all nationality barriers . 
  no it 's not . 
  it is to reduce imbalances and to provide enough tools to the eurozone to prevent such imbalances between countries to occur and to have better mechanisms to respond to financial shocks that threaten to unravel the eurozone . 
  so a conservative german prognoses that eurobonds would cost that . 
  i can probably find other thinkers who will give you different numbers . 
  and if the vast majority of the population and countries of the eurozone are not in a good situation then maybe the rules should be changed to better help the vast majority of those countries/populations . 
  germany is 80 million people ? 
  ok , france is 65 , italy is 65 and spain is 45 . 
  they all want changes to the rules and mechanisms of the eurozone . 
  lets go to a vote then and see where that leaves germany . 
  you 'll have the netherlands with you , congrats . 
  no , he is not . 
  and france is a liquid contributor to the eu budget as much as germany is . 
  i do n't understand where do you guys found this misconception that only germany is giving money to eu and everyone else is trying to steal money from you . 
  stop reading the fucking bild . 
  yes , we are a small economy so we are very dependent on how our economic partners do . 
  with spain and the rest of the euro area growing we will also do well . 
  i hope your growth does n't stall too much when you control your public deficit . 
  i think one of the main factors for you guys having so much growth is that you did n't control your budget deficit in the past years ( not saying that it is bad though since you are in better shape to handle those big deficits than we are ) . 
  sorry , i respect you very much and we do have a lot of common interests , you make me smile a lot but i just do n't see you that way . 
  and i do n't want to risk loosing my best friend by trying something that may not work out . 
  then you know wrong because we exceeded our deficit obligations in 2017 . 
  even without extraordinary measures we fullfilled the deficit obligations . 
  so go educate yourself . 
  yeah `` buddy '' , we already did that and our deficit went well below what was demanded by the eurozone so shove that down your throat `` buddy '' . 
  just how germany did when it constantly broke the deficit rules in the beginning of the 00 's and no one told you guys anything ? 
  this is the most accurate . 
  dr. strangelove does n't mind wrecking the eu in the long-term as long as his excel spreadsheets look nice in the short-term . 
  well , he did put those contracts guaranteeing that energy companies would get subsidies for building wind power . 
  right now they 're giving contracts to build solar power without those subsidies . 
  we invested a lot in wind power a few years ago . 
  there are a few plans for solar power in the next few years though . 
  i agree with you to a point . 
  i think that referendums should happen simultaneously with important elections . 
  but even then i can see problems with that . 
  i do n't think referendums are an essential tool for democracies to make decisions though . 
  yes . 
  we elect our leaders for something . 
  we do n't need referendums for everything , especially when people seem to be incapable of voting without truly thinking of the consequences of the thing they 're voting in but using referendum votes as protest votes . 
  you do n't need a majority e styrene . 
  you need comprehension and willingness to negotiate of who is benefiting more of the ones currently benefiting more of an unbalanced system . 
  and why are you making an assumption that such an eurozone would n't allow you to vote on its leader who would control the eurozone finance and economy minister ? 
  because right now , the situation is exactly as you say . 
  you have a bunch of unelected finance ministers dictating to democratically elected governments how to run their countries or they will wreck their economies . 
  hey , portugal too !, 
  we 're spain 's sibling that did n't get marketing right ( since many of the products they sell as spanish actually come from portugal ... ) . 
  what shcaeuble is saying is that him and the dominant faction of the cdu/csu are against this . 
  you have a majority in france and italy wanting changes in the way the eu works . 
  well , i have to hope things will change for the better but your scenario is extremely likely then . 
  could you tell me why you believe this ? 
  dude , i already apologized and gave a more well measured response to heinsz7 . 
  we 're actually having a very nice exchange of ideas . 
  are you something to him to come to his rescue ? 
  because i do n't recall calling you to the conversation . 
  we could have national debts as we have now but the interest rate between all the countries should be the same . 
  much like we have a common coin for example . 
  that 's the main problem . 
  & nbsp ; i hope we can find some common solution because otherwise i 'm really afraid things will break down . 
  and the countries that will suffer the most will be the small countries in the periphery like estonia or portugal . 
  however , i think it depends more on the big countries to reach an agreement between themselves . 
  yes i listen to myself . 
  you antagonize me , you get a stupid retort back . 
  you try to speak calmly you may get something different in return . 
  ofcourse . 
  those differences originate from different historical backgrounds . 
  did you ever bother to ask what about before those 40 years ? 
  in portugal , for a long time we did n't have so much care about the budget deficit and public spending because portugal was massively underdeveloped compared to other european countries because we lived under a fascist dictatorship . 
  & nbsp ; a dictatorship that was very fiscally responsible but that let the vast majority of the portuguese population without access to education beyond the elementary level ( 4 years of education ) , without a national health service to even speak of , without any proper infrastructure such as highways , proper roads and railways .
