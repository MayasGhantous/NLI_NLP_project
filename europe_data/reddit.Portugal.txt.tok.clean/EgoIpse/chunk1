i 've written about this before in this sub , so i 'll just paste it here , because retyping is not fun . 
  & nbsp ; it 's complicated . 
  the regime that came before , the 1st republic ( 1910-1926 ) was a complete mess , with governments that 'd last less than a week , presidents constantly trying to become dictators or getting shot , an unpopular war ( wwi ) , anti-clericalism and wasteful spending that led us nearly bankrupt . 
  salazar started as finance minister and managed to right the budget and fix the economy for the first time in decades . 
  furthermore his work in the first years had some good things , granting some stability to the country , shrewdly keeping us out of wwii and making some infrastructure and economic growth . 
  also , compared to the other fascist regimes , his was rather a light one , with a very softened personality cult ( he was notoriously reserved ) and political repression ( people 'd be jailed , often sent to the colonies or even tortured , but killings were very rare ) . 
  the colonial war is widely considered a mistake , and it 's the reason the revolution happened in 74 and not in the 90 's , but even then we had the economy growing very fast . 
  were it not for it , i 'd say we 'd have gone the south korean way . 
  so yeah some people think he was satan incarnate , and some he was the greatest statesman we ever had , but overall we have mixed feelings about it . 
  40 + years have passed since he died , we can look at it more objectively now . 
  he was voted the greatest portuguese [ ever ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/os_grandes_portugueses ) in 2007 though , beating people like [ d. afonso henriques ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/afonso_i_of_portugal ) , [ vasco da gama ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/vasco_da_gama ) , [ fernando pessoa ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/fernando_pessoa ) and [ aristides de sousa mendes ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/aristides_de_sousa_mendes ),

  the best part is the government of guinea-bissau 's response after tap ( portuguese public airline ) suspended the route after the massive safety breach : `` of the portuguese government we 're already expecting everything . 
  the council of ministers of guinea will meet again tomorrow to take a stand . 
  it 's regrettable that tap mixes commercial with political decisions '' as if they were blameless by the mess they made,

  fair enough , i did n't even think about how the term maps across languages . 
  fixed, 
  yes , but that visit is only mandatory if you are a minor ( and in some cases of heavy re incidence / violence , methinks ) . 
  if you are caught and the police decide to pursue , it 'd lead to a panel offering you that possibility , so they do n't do it at all unless there 's a need ( like a minor ) if you are caught with large amounts ( 25g for weed , do n't know the others ) then it 's considered traffic though , and your ass gets hauled to jail, 
  maybe it 's both . 
  maybe because we were isolated from the rest of the world until 74 , the whole war on drugs debacle sounds foreign . 
  hell , most european problems sound really distant over here ( the syrians might as well be going to china ) from what i can tell you , people do n't give two fucks . 
  i 've seen people smoking joints in the most lively streets in town , and i 've had friends stopped by police have their weed returned . 
  this . 
  i seriously do n't understand why other countries do n't do what we did . 
  it works wonders, 
  our [ culture ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/jo%c3%a3o_soares_ ( politician \\ ) ) minister , and [ son ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/m%c3%a1rio_soares ) of a former president , prime minister and founding member of the socialist party ( clearly not nepotism / s ) [ resigned ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/09/portuguese-minister-resigns-after-threat-to-give-journalists-a-good-slap ) after promising to slap two columnists who wrote very critical pieces of him in a left-leaning newspaper , [ denouncing ( pt ) ] ( https://www.publico.pt/culturaipsilon/noticia/tempo-velho-na-cultura-1728263 ) ( ca n't find the other ) his incompetence , corruption and cronyism ( he was firing people and replacing them with friends , party members and fellow free masons ) . 
  good riddance . 
  it 's sad really . 
  he was rushed in after the person [ expected ] ( https://imagens0.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/1036640?tp=uh&amp;db=imagens&amp;w=749 ) to fill the role , suddenly died . 
  it 's a shame , cause he was a [ really ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zhieisy.png ) competent and enthusiastic guy ...

  and the bs that people swing at christians for comparatively microscopic things is ridiculous compared to people that believe it to be righteous to execute either me or decent but ` heretical ' fellows like asad shah in a public square , and have the legal and institutional power to do so in their home countries . 
  i believe that every person ought to have similar liberties and possibilities . 
  and if it 's your culture to oppress others , then fuck you and your culture . 
  every person is equal . 
  not every culture . 
  in portuguese it 's the opposite actually . 
  dark ) is the more polite way to say it , whilst `` preto '' ( \u02c8p\u027eetu , lit . 
  black ) is the offensive word . 
  and it 's not like we never had colonies either ... 
  the mishmash of populism , cult personality and realpolitik creates these situations where you ca n't ever be sure in what way to interpret things . 
  it 's like the generalized poe 's law of politics, 
  considering that it 's 2/3 of our minimum income , and that hundreds of thousands earn less than that at the end of the month , i would n't be surprised if you got more portuguese refugees , because you know , the civil war here is bloody af / s,

  alas , i am drunk and there 's nothing better to drink, 
  i translated the titles , the collection of the images and the original naming is not mine , as you can read right at start . 
  furthermore the pictures where i kept the portuguese name were the ones that had the name quoted , implying they had been given a title by someone before . 
  great eye to detail though . 
  nice one , but [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ka7jshh.jpg ) my personal favorite, 
  also this . 
  saying that ocalan stands for the same things than barzani is disingenuously wrong, 
  the whole thing between the turks and the kurds is a sad , massive and prolongued shitfest and wo n't really end until the kurds get a nation for themselves . 
  nation-states and self-determination are a thing for a [ reason ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ajkdwic.jpg ) . 
  regardless , all violence is to be repudiated and pointed as despicable . 
  there is no excuse for the killing of innocents . 
  well , the akp will say they were kurds regardless , unless the evidence is too strong . 
  i 'd bet my money on isis , since it would be a very dumb move on the kurdish side , but regardless of who did it , they are fucking idiots . 
  my thoughts are to the victims of this stupid crap . 
  i am aware of it , and we have the word `` antiguidade '' meaning antiquity just like in english . 
  thing is , `` antigo '' can be used for both ancient rome , `` roma antiga '' , or just something with some years . 
  in the end , i decided to lose on the accuracy of the translation so as to preserve the positivity of the wording , since old , or `` velho '' in portuguese , have more of a negative feel to it . 
  i 'm not sure if i did the best compromise , but it 's a bit too late to change it now : /, 
  it 's complicated . 
  the regime that came before , the 1st republic ( 1910-1926 ) was a complete mess , with governments that 'd last less than a week , presidents constantly trying to become dictators or getting shot , an unpopular war ( wwi ) , anti-clericalism and wasteful spending that led us nearly bankrupt .

  this is a fair point . 
  it was a bit late and i was thinking about how to translate it . 
  the word employed in portuguese is `` antigo '' which maps to english as both old and ancient , but like ancient and unlike old it does n't carry as much of a negative connotation with it ( it can even be a positive thing ) . 
  for that reason primarily , i opted for the word ancient in the title , even though they are n't really `` ancient '' . 
  looking back , maybe i ought to have translated it as `` portraits of portugal past '' or something along those lines ... 
  there are actually some germanic marks in the country , in the names of places and things .
