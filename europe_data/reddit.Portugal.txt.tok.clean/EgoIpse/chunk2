  a meeting of the parliamentary democratic group . 
  it is said that mr. affonso ? 
  costa shall expose to the majority the political outlook of the situation , so that the attitude regarding the national [ unity ] government be well defined ***** ## ** what the political chiefs think ** ***** mr. antonio jos\u00e9 de almeida , to whom the lack of health shall not impede of attending today in the chamber , met today in his home his political friends with whom he traded impressions on the situation . 
  what thinks mr. antonio jos\u00e9 de almeida ? 
  we can conclude from the following words inserted ?? 
  today in the `` republica '' [ republic ] , his press organ : `` this fact ( the declaration of war ) is nothing but the logical result of the attitude that portugal assumed since the first hour of the european conflict , by putting itself side by side with england , its old ally . 
  and it is also not doubtful for our spirit of patriots and republicans that the nation shall run with energy , valor and abnegation all the risks that might accrue from the loyal and herculean fulfillment that has been performing of the duties as ally of great britain . 
  -- [ text breaks off here ] ***** ## ** afterword ** for those that do n't know , the lack of preparedness and the deaths `` approximately 12,000 portuguese troops died during the course of world war i , including africans serving in its armed forces . 
  civilian deaths exceeded the prewar level by 220,000 : 82,000 caused by food shortages and 138,000 by the spanish flu '' were an important reason for the [ collapse ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/28_may_1926_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) of the first republic in 1926 and the rising of the fascist dictatorship that lasted until [ 1974 ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/carnation_revolution ), 
  yup . 
  just added another column , will keep updating it . 
  takes a bit though . 
   the text is written in old orthography . 
  i 've let the old names be as they are , but notice many of the words are written differently today ( eg . 
  affonso -  afonso , phase -  fase , hontem -  ontem )  some words are a bit hard to understand . 
  they are followed by a ?

  & nbsp ; # ** glory to portugal ** ***** ##### * column 1 * if germany thought , in its arrogance , colossus that begins to crumble already by the impetus of the free races , that it would frighten a small people , that it 'd break his moral [ the people , treated as a he ] by terror , based ? 
  in its dignity , in its [ exalted , see etymology ] haughtiness , in its honor by brutally declaring war -- germany is completely wrong . 
  portugal is a small country , but portugal is a dignified nation , to whom treaties , in which the oathed faith of people are expressed do not make shreds of paper . 
  to fulfill the duties that they decree , portugal , like belgium , would let itself be devastated , but it would not consent any indignity . 
  germany ought to know it . 
  germany ought to know the history of our country . 
  she [ germany ] must not ignore that portugal has faced death before without trembling ; that against him [ portugal ] gigantic forces have been unleashed before , but it would be said that fate does n't allow to die those nations that do n't shimmer before death to honor the name of the fatherland . 
  today was not the day of terror . 
  today was the day of national strength . 
  whomever assisted to the first session [ of parliament ] that was -- [ the text breaks off here ] ##### * column 2 * -- all those that , forcefully want to take place there . 
  the war , in this time of recess between the moment that the first onlookers gather and that in which action must begin is the natural and forced subject of all commentaries . 
  in what terms is redacted the german declaration ? 
  what consequences may it bring to our country ? 
  there are mps that are almost carried in triumph . 
  the confusion is huge . 
  there is no door that resists the impetus of the crowd . 
  the sentinels are dislodged violently and the corridors soon overflow . 
  in the [ passos perdidos ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c0omtxk.jpg ) [ part of the parliament ] there is also a immense amount of people . 
  riffle butt hits boil , not escaping them the mps themselves , complaining of aggressions . 
  the mr. minister of france , when arriving receives a great ovation . 
  there are hails to the allied nations and the enthusiasm is enormous . 
  by 16 o\u2019clock , there are in the respective tribune , besides that [ the french ] diplomat , the misters ministers of england and wife , russia , belgium , italy and the representatives of uruguay , nicaragua , etc. 
  from the ministry , come firstly the misters . 
  ministers of [ no clue ] ?? 
  and navy . 
  the mr. minister of the foreigner [ affairs , lit foreigners ] comes by 16:10 . 
  in the tribune of the diplomatic corps , there are also almost all legation secretaries . 
  mr. brito camacho with mr. jos\u00e9 barbosa [ do n't even meme ] -- [ text breaks off here ] ##### * column 3 * -- [ ?? 
  ] ing against the sequester of the vessels . 
  the portuguese government replied , granting as good its action and keeping it , seeing it as determined by the necessity of keeping international trade and in virtue of legal dispositions . 
  the italian government , says the report made as much . 
  the portuguese government , apart from that obliged itself to paying all indemnities that be deemed fair . 
  to that communication , germany responded with a note delivered yesterday in the ministry of foreigners . 
  the whisper and the loose speeches increased in the galleries . 
  the president , by that reason , threatened to evacuate them . 
  and the minister ends up apologizing to the congress for not omitting certain ` unusual ' [ the word here , ins\u00f3lito , is more of a * pardon my french * way of saying it ] terms from note he has just read . 
  the mr. president of the ministry , taking the word again , says that the government has safeguarded the honor of the country and insured the exercise of all the rights that are appanage of free countries . 
  by taking care of power , in has employed all efforts so that the government to form be [ of ] national [ unity ] . 
  it has not achieved it , but affirmed that he would remain attached to that compromised , to be realized whenever needed . 
  the government has always been making politics for the nation , most of all when it comes to our external relations . 
  by the mediation of the chief of state , the parties were always informed of what was going on . 
  portugal is honorably attached to england 's luck , to its pains and its -- [ text breaks off here ] ##### * column 4 * -- meeting that is happening , wants to declare that he was never had , in his soul , political hate to no one . 
  he did n't ever have it for the monarchics [ kingdom had been overthrown 6 years prior ] , like he could n't ever have it for the republicans . 
  his words mean , mostly , the desire to [ no clue ] ??? 
  until the end , for the good of the fatherland , in whose destiny he has the utmost faith . 
  [ he ] also trusts in the energy of his race and believes that from this crisis , it shall come purified , redeemed and strengthened mr. brito camacho says that , if heard correctly the reading of the report of the mr. minister of foreigners , england has asked us the german vessels . 
  it 's a possible thing to do . 
  and he always defended the need to concede to england all that she asked of us . 
  and defends still today the same doctrine . 
  to england we must not refuse anything that is asked of us in the name of our alliance . 
  he , at least , shall not refuse it . 
  the government entered with juridical formulae . 
  it is not known until what point was respected the commerce treaty with germany . 
  but of its disrespect , the berlin government shall not be able to complain , for it was the first one to forget it . 
  after the reading of the german note , no other thing could have been done but to present the bill in an initiative of the mr. president of the ministry . 
  it 'd be a subservience and a useless indignity . 
  we are , after all , at war with germany . 
  the moment this is a serious one , due to the disturbances that the state of war shall bring us .

  -- [ text breaks off here ] ##### * column 5 * -- portuguese must forget in this historic moment the european war blew of in the 2nd of august of 1914 , entering in it england in the 4th of the same month . 
  in the 5th , it was given to us the guarantee by the british government that the integrity of the portuguese colonies and continent would be protected , being then asked by the english government that we would not declare our neutrality . 
  in august 7th , the session of the congress of the republic was realized in which through the `` leaders '' [ written in english ] of all parties the assertion was made that portugal would remain faithful to the centuries-old alliance treaties with great britain . 
  in august 24th , we suffered the first german quarrel . 
  it was in the small outpost of mazi ?? 
  [ maybe mazina , not sure ] , in the north of the province of mozambique and in the banks of the rovuma . 
  a treacherous assault by the germans made mourn the death of a navy sergeant that commanded that outpost in october 17th , arises the naulila ? 
  incident with ensign sereno . 
  disrespected and threatened the portuguese authority by german graduates that had invaded our territory , ensign sereno saw himself to order a discharge against the invaders , which resulted in the death of some germans [ ironic , since sereno means serene in portuguese ] meanwhile , in october 10th , england delivered us the well-known `` memorandum '' [ written in english ] in which it was asked to us -- [ text breaks off here ],

  well , we have a saying that goes like this : `` god created the black and the white , but the portuguese made the mulatto '' `` deus criou o preto e o branco mas o portugu\u00eas fez o mulato '',
