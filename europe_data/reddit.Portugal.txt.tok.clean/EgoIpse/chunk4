  you taught them well in your ways i see, 
  there 're plenty of people drinking their meia de leite in the afternoon ... 
  [ aljubarrota ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/battle_of_aljubarrota ) & nbsp ; seriously though : & nbsp ; -- what is the ego ? 
  it 's the small spaniard inside each of us & nbsp ; -- what 's the world 's most profitable business ? 
  to buy a spaniard for what he 's worth and sell him for what he thinks he is . 
  & nbsp ; the spanish pm , in an official visit to portugal , was visiting a primary school . 
  before he arrived , the director prepared the students to properly recieve him . 
  -- now , you must be polite to mr. rajoy . 
  jo\u00e3ozinho , i 'll be asking what spain is to us , and you say that spain is our friend . 
  -- no , mr. director , spain is our brother . 
  but you need n't say so much . 
  just say that they are our friends . 
  -- no , and no , spain 's our brother country . 
  -- ok jo\u00e3ozinho ... but why do you think that they 're our brothers and not our friends ? 
  -- because friends , we can pick our own !, 
  & nbsp ; [ note , portuguese kids in jokes are always called jo\u00e3ozinho , lit . 
  little john ], 
  yeah ... the dinner time news starts at 20:00 and that 's a fairly common dinnertime , albeit on the early side of things but it 's not that odd for people to start eating at 21:00 , or even later if with friends, 
  it happens a bit across the whole south of europe , so i 'd say it 's probably either because it 's warmer at night , or because days are longer in the winter . 
  nevertheless , other night related things , like dinner also tend to happen later on the more south you go . 
  nope , just look at the country flag . 
  looks nothing like italy 's, 
  why would i be from italy !, 
   first place goes to your own people , second place goes to your closes alies ( ... ) third place goes to your `` normal `` allies for political reasons . 
  i used to think this goes without saying . 
  it 's just basic human nature to care more for those closer to you . 
  your family member dying is a tragedy , a family member of a friend is sad and someone you do n't know , well is life . 
  we just ca n't possibly care for everyone everywhere the same . 
  i wish we could , but it 's hypocritical to say so . 
   not only do they do nothing for their own people , there are millions of starving children all over europe that are ignored for the sake of the refugees . 
  thing is , they are not ignored for the sake of refugees . 
  when greece 's and our own economy tanked , german efforts went not to directly help us , or our poor , but to ensure we would n't drag them down with them . 
  and in our case , part of the problem was their fault , because by refusing steps for a financial union and equity of tax payment inside the eurozone , they greatly lowered borrowing costs while at the same time crippling our exportation capacity ( because 200x stronger currency ) and blocking our efforts to control capital escape and tax readjustments . 
  part of the reason they threw money at us in the previous decades without having any control was for stopgap purposes . 
  they payed people to close their farms and fishing activities with simple injections of cash ( i wish i was joking , but this is literally what they did . 
  oh the protectionism ) so that they 'd invest that money in buying finished goods from them , giving a boost to themselves and artificial liquidity to us . 
  when that ended , we had to turn to those even more artificially low interest rates to keep financing ourselves . 
  so even if there were no refugees , they would n't help our poor that much , because they 're not interested in that , nor will that grant them votes, 
  hey , just because orban is pushing for non democratic reforms , which appall me , it does not mean that he does n't have a point in here . 
  i really , really like schengen . 
  and i would like for the union to continue . 
  but if we ditch our internal borders , we need to get our shit together and have a external border . 
  it just wo n't work otherwise . 
  & nbsp ;  `` solidarity means helping people who are in danger where they live , and helping them to return home once the conflict is finished , '' this is so bloody true i do n't know where to start . 
  it 's [ way ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/diminishing_returns ) more effective to create infrastructure in the first place , than to expand it ad hoc . 
  also , without improving the situation in poor countries , birth rates [ will ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) negate any amount we can ever take in . 
  it 's just how geometric growth works , nothing surprising . 
  also , it 's much easier to integrate people in countries with similar cultures and economic levels . 
  employing [ unskilled ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3wzxat/report_reveals_most_syrian_refugees_are/ ) manpower in post industrial societies , where even factory workers need the 12th year and extra formation is nigh impossible . 
  in a similarly devolved country to their own , not so much . 
  & nbsp ;  `` stupidity is letting hundreds of thousands of people -- millions -- into europe with no controls , while everyone , europeans and migrants alike , can see they 'll never get what they hoped for here , '' once again , true . 
  this clusterfrack is a like a postmodern trail of tears , with people dying in troves on the way to the promised land of milk and honey . 
  it 's disgusting to let it happen in the first place . 
  i 'd be all for a screening in camps outside the eu , under an well established protocol and distribution system , to have quotas of people from these places come . 
  that way we could still ease some of the burden , while filtering violent , extremist , or too [ dissonant ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/valuesdissonance ) individuals and prioritizing endangered minorities like the [ yazidi ] ( http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/24/women-escaped-slavery-isis-sinjar/ ) on a more pragmatic note , and quoting from a [ previous ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vwt04/ammunition_is_propaganda_found_after_france/cxrejsa ) post of mine , [ this ] ( http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/journal/jel2015.pdf ) is a great eye opener . 
  it explains how income is bound to fall for the lower and middle class only to hugely increase for the upper class with massive influx of migrants ( tl ; dr think of it as the reverse of what happened in the black plague , too much manpower to employ ) . 
  and being for policy that screws the poor in favour of the rich is a very right wing thing to do actually . 
  so it surprises me that only strongly right wing people like orban stand against these policies . 
  & nbsp ; also , there are many stupid things we do , we could be doing in a much better way , like creating fledgling economies in refugee camps by employing that unskilled manpower in added value jobs . 
  we could do that by also sending them raw goods ( grain instead of bread , cloth instead of clothes ) , which are way cheaper , easier to storage and take longer to spoil and employ them in processing that , which would not only help take away their minds from the awful situation they 're in , but help give them a sense of meaning . 
  in the end , yes . 
  we are being very stupid in handling this crisis , and we could be doing way better . 
  for both their and our own sake, 
  true , but only if they were catholics . 
  if they were not converted it was fair game . 
  it is also a reason why the portuguese and the spaniards had some grievances with some religious orders in the new world , because they tried to convert slaves and thus remove manpower from indenture . 
   and pronounce `` sh '' instead of `` s '' . 
  instead of saying `` spain is a nation '' he says `` spain ish a nation '' . 
  maybe [ portuguese ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ) influences ? 
  and it 's not like museums have a duty to record history as it was , instead of as we wish it had been . 
  remember when the catholic church cut off or added fig leaves to the penises on the artworks in the vatican ? 
  right this must be the horseshoe theory of prudish idiocy ... 
  and also ourselves ... 
  but doing so , the pipe also serves more people , earning more revenue . 
  combined with the costs i said above , it more than offsets that, 
  every part , including germany . 
  the costs for building and maintaining underwater pipes is much higher than that of those that go above ground, 
  you understand you can do that way more cheaply with a pipe that does not go by sea or skirt poland and the baltic states right ? 
  the fact it does proves it 's only a way to let them be cut without affecting germany, 
  everyone must share the burden of the waves of migrants coming to us , because europe means solidarity , so -- what 's that , russia 's acting all jingoistic again ? 
  do n't worry about it my eastern bros , we got your backs and -- so you know about the stream ? 
  awkward ... nevermind that . 
  it 's just some silly big boys business . 
  and besides , [ when ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/first_partition_of_poland ) did [ we ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/second_partition_of_poland ) ever [ plot ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/third_partition_of_poland ) with [ the ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/congress_of_vienna ) russians [ to ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/krak%c3%b3w_uprising ) screw [ you ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/november_uprising ) over , [ huh ? 
  ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ), 
   simply noting that portugal , at least thus far , did n't complain we simply wo n't . 
  we 're a country of soft habits , and it takes a whole lot to make us complain, 
  initially the quota was to be of 1k . 
  it was depressingly entertaining to see how the number slightly increased each evening at the news . 
  looked like the guy asking 100 , i mean 50 $ to his father but on reverse . 
  also , despite accepting the quota , only about 50 accepted coming so far . 
  people want to be in dc countries and that 's them apples ... 
  but all in all , the smoke still looks fairly distant as of now for us . 
  it 's not a issue for us right now , and in the elections earlier this autumn it was barely mentioned apart from standard answer 3-b : * we must help the people in need *, 
  can that lovely solidarity also apply to our sovereign debt , or does it only work to protect some when it 's hitting the fan ? 
  [ i 'm not saying soldiers ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/vx51b.jpg ), 
  it 'd be too close to braga on the map . 
  not a prudent decision, 
  it sounds like simlish, 
  the sh sounds came from a fairly more recent sound change which made most s sounds in the coda of the syllable to become sh .
