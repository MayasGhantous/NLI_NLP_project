  that was happening by the time brazil became independent ( 1820 ) and it is why most accents in br-pt have nowhere near as many sh sounds while the african accents do since they only became independent later on ( 1974 ) those silent ms and ns are not exactly silent . 
  portuguese has 14 vowels , and it distinguishes between nasalized and non nasalized vowels . 
  those letters are markers that the vowel before is nasalized, 
  i know it 's kind of insane to ask these things , but why are we doing this ? 
  is this really the best way to help hundreds of thousands , or millions of displaced people ? 
  and if it is , is it something feasible to repeat on future crises ? 
  and if it is , are we doing ourselves and them any good , by creating these huge centers where they can segregate themselves and where old ethno-religious tensions can be further strained ( is it a good idea to lump sunnis and yazidis , or persians and iraqis for instance ) ? 
  i think the answer to these is no . 
  we are creating a goddamned trail of tears , and it 's depressing and just fucking unacceptable . 
  further more , we are not solving the causes of the influx nor even considering how high birthrates will ensure that the number of people we take in is never enough , how we will integrate unskilled manpower on a post-industrial society or even how we could employ people in refugee camps , by sending them unprocessed goods ( grain instead of bread , cloth instead of clothes ) and both address the unemployment as create a fledgling economy and sense of normality in the camps ) i seriously do n't know why germany , the netherlands and most western european countries do this , but i 'll say what we 're doing to the people you send us . 
  we try and distribute them on the family unit level throughout the country , to both cities and villages , ensuring that that nowhere they hit these critical masses where integration into society just becomes impossible . 
  ( and yes , we have had experience with migrants of a much larger scale , albeit of the same culture and relgion . 
  after the revolution in '74 over 500k , and later a few hundred thousand more returned to this 10m country , most with nothing but the clothes they wore ) edit : typo,

  if you disregard all the cultural tensions , violence , inequality and localized collapse of infrastructure , then yes , it 's working like a charm, 
  why so ? 
  the leader of the portuguese muslim community [ and only imam ] has admitted on national television that multiculturalism is a failed policy . 
  & nbsp ; that is not to say that we should send them back with a kick on their rears , but the idea that we can just go to other countries and impose our ways at will can only go to a certain point . 
  there are things so fundamentally irreconcilable ( like wahhabism and women 's rights ) that something has got to give , or else you 're just going to end with ghettos inside your cities . 
  and no one likes ghettos . 
  & nbsp ; there 's something to be said to the fact that the same people that fought so hard to give every group of people the right to self determination in the nation they belong to , now wish to turn every country into an amorphous blend devoid of identity ... 
  great book that one is .

  you know , like in the good old fifties, 
   stagnant wages in america hurt a cohort of older working-class white men so should we welcome stagnant wages ? 
  because a petrified middle class seems to me like a serious problem also , what 's the point of going on this tirade of pointing the finger to white man ? 
  if there is a problem in society we should look into it , regardless of who says it . 
  or should we only listen to the complaints of the other demographics and send white man off into that good night or something ?

  not at all . 
  we 're venture capitalists, 
  i see what you are saying . 
  it 's the white man 's fault for being so racist to them . 
  moot point . 
  the fact that several groups that come to western [ ized ] countries consistently integrate in different ways across several countries implies that there is some difference in the outgroups willingness to assimilate , or at least be a part of the society they are in . 
  and taking a line from thomas sowell , difference of outcome does not imply a difference of opportunity . 
  were that so , all people could become michael jordan , which is clearly not true .

  you 'd pay reparation to the people affected . 
  you do n't pay reparation to people whose grandfather 's grandfathers were the ones affected . 
  there has been enough time for any inequality to be ironed out with personal effort . 
  most asians came to america later and they 're the best payed demographic as of today, 
  it 's the yo-yo diet of nationalism,

  seems like it, 
  small correction though . 
  [ it 's 4754 offered , 50 accepted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ugmyy/portugal_offered_to_receive_4754_refugees_only_50/ ), 
  thing is , i am very concerned . 
  i think that we should up our support to these refugees . 
  just not in this manner , because it 's terribly inefficient , it does n't solve the background problem and we 're actively causing thousands of deaths by promising a land of milk and honey at the end of the trail of tears . 
  let 's not be hypocritical , i value more highly the well-being of the people of my own country . 
  most of us do . 
  it 's how the human brain works and it 's what distance does to us . 
  a family member dying is a tragedy , one from a friend 's family is sad and a stranger dying is life . 
  if we want to solve and prevent this issues , we need to install a system to create infrastructure , industrial potential and modern education and healthcare in these countries , while controlling birthrates , otherwise , people will just pile up in poverty . 
  sending food and clothes does n't solve the problem either , and money itself will be pocketed by the middlemans . 
  when we have crisis we must create ways to accommodate them in the immediate neighborhood of countries , wherever they are . 
  also when giving immediate help we must also provide them not with finished products , but instead raw goods that they can process for employment and a sense of meaning i ca n't stress this enough . 
  for example , instead of sending bread , pasta and clothes , send unprocessed grain and fabric ( which also stores better ) and employ the refugees in the making of the finished produce we should also bypass corrupt governments as much as we can and try and act directly alongside ngos ... 
  i could go on this tangent for days , but alas , dinner calls, 
  i 'm fairly left wing myself , but i do n't see how being against a insane policy is racist . 
  also [ this ] ( http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/journal/jel2015.pdf ) is a great eye opener . 
  it explains how income is bound to fall for the lower and middle class only to hugely increase for the upper class with massive influx of migrants ( tl ; dr think of it as the reverse of what happened in the black plague , too much manpower to employ ) . 
  and being for policy that screws the poor in favour of the rich is a very right wing thing to do actually, 
  you can ban certain aspects of it , when the problems raised outweight the benefits . 
  you cant simply build a breeder reactor in your backyard or start a cloning/eugenics facility , even though the technology is out there . 
  the question is on wether this will be effective or benefitial to the efforts , and the answer seems to be a solid no, 
  they send messages openly through sms , so the solution is to block tor . 
  seems reasonable . 
  also , what 's preventing people from sending messages through redstone circuits in minecraft private servers ?
