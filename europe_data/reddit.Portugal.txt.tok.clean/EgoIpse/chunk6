  open society and it 's enemies ( 1945 ) , karl popper when the same quote can describe both jihadi , nazi and feminist reaction to the other you know you have gone off the deep end, 
  no , but acting above the law because of religion is a bad idea . 
  and assuming that it 's ok for some laws is even worse , because the corollary is that those are just silly laws that we do n't even have to follow . 
   that bolt does n't kill the animal . 
  a blade is used to kill the animal in both cases . 
  even if it were n't , the carcass is still going to be cut up afterwards good point . 
  the animal should be allowed to die in the less painful way then . 
  it 's already dying , and religion should n't be a source of pain . 
  since slicing your neck in cold blood is painful it should not be allowed unless the animal is stunned first and unable to feel it . 
   no one is breaking the law here . 
  the question of what the law should be is what i 'm referring to as a trade off between animal welfare and freedom of religion . 
  yes , but if you are in the clear because you crafted the law to create an exception just for you , then that is not a real solution and not really in line with what we want in society . 
  [ case in point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese-style_bullfighting ) portugal outlawed bullfighting where the bull is killed on stage in 2002 , but after protests , they created an exception for places where there is a tradition for it , [ keeping the custom alive ] ( http://theportugalnews.com/news/barrancos-bullfights-to-the-death-unshaken-by-controversy-elsewhere/26687 ) in the border town of barrancos , about the only place where that really still happened . 
  the unsanitary part would come from the blade coming into contact with every animal being butchered , unlike the bolt to the brain / u/sukrim mentioned . 
  in an ideal world the blade would be cleaned and disinfected after every kill , but this is bound to not happen , especially in smaller establishments , leaving more leeway for infections to spread animal welfare is a big issue here though , but i think that the dichotomy there is a false one . 
  it 's not animal welfare or freedom of religion , it 's freedom of religion or the rule of law . 
  i do n't know if considering it 's alright to break the law if in the name of ( a ) god is a road we want to go down into, 
  so ... it 's like spain then where everyone must show their hair in id photos unless you 're muslim . 
  my problem with this approach to law is just that it breaks the equality we strove for . 
  we 've agreed we should uphold the rule of law equally regardless of sex , gender orientation , race , whatever , but suddenly religion is ok ? 
  it 's this sort of backtracking and doublethink that allows for disingenuous attempts at segregation by people that call themselves open minded and progressive . 
  it 's sad really . 
  honest question , how does this procedure of killing the animal by severing the neck with a blade fit in with modern western health regulation standards ? 
  is it viable , are there legal exceptions or do sanitation authorities in europe just look to the side and whistle ? 
  i think in portugal you can slaughter your farm animals yourself , but if you need a vet nearby and if you do it out of a proper slaughterhouse you ca n't sell the meat, 
  crimea river, 
  -- what kind of roof do you want fam ? 
  -- just, 
   against al qaeda nope . 
  with isis yes . 
  they want their state , they have a currency pegged on the value of gold , they raise taxes , they have exports and trades . 
  they 're a state and like every state they can be destroyed . 
  my point exactly . 
  you can beat the organization , but you are not destroying the ideology . 
  isis is way more tangible , so it seems more so , but the causes remain and wherever the conditions are right it can resurface . 
  likewise if you do n't remove the underlying issues , regardless of how many mexican drug cartels you bust , another will pop  the war has to happen . 
  isis is killing people in syria . 
  so is assad . 
  the syria issue must be solved . 
  they are both terrible in their own ways , albeit i 'd say assad is marginally better . 
  needless to say i agree that the issue must be solved . 
  i think everyone agrees so . 
  this whole shitfest is just a disagreement on the terms of the solution ...  and how is it relevant to the issue ? 
  does france have the same constitution as the roman empire ? 
  mkay . 
  they were both republics . 
  it was still a republic when cesar got there . 
  there are differences ofc , from technology , to electoral representation to systems of legislation and structure . 
  nevertheless , elations can be taken about the end of republican societies ( not that i 'm a tinfoil thinking this is their endgoal . 
  it 's more on the ballpark of the restriction of some rights )  yeah algeria was going through a civil war that spilled over . 
  it lasted 11 years and between 50k - 150k people died . 
  in a country of 40 million , that 's a friggin lot . 
  was not fully aware of the death toll . 
  good point there actually . 
  still does not factor in egypt though afaik  they are not false , nor are they relevant . 
  i beg to differ  this convo is going all over the place . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  oh well , have a nice day then,

  how so ? 
  & nbsp ; do you deny that declaring war on terrorism is like declaring war on drugs , something that is pleasing to the ear , but ultimately unwinnable in the sense of a classical war ? 
  it 's an eternal struggle if you go at it that way , especially when you try to fight an ideology . 
  you can beat the nazis ( not france , but that 's not the point ) but you ca n't win a war on ideology itself . 
  & nbsp ; do you disagree that a major reason for declaring such wars is so that you can maintain for longer or indeterminately a state of emergency while seeming legitimate ? 
  & nbsp ; do you deny the existence of the position of the roman dictator and the emergency powers granted to it during times of need ? 
  & nbsp ; or are you suggesting julius cesar did n't make use of that mechanism and that the following rulers only slowly styled themselves as the classical emperor , changing legislation bit by bit ? 
  & nbsp ; or maybe you are the denying the usage of the state of emergency for years on end as justification for the restriction of democracy , the arab world being a great example , as before the arab spring there was for example one for 19 years in algeria , and 31 in egypt ? 
  the processes i have pointed to are present in society . 
  none of this is false, 
  but france [ is ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/16/president-hollande-says-france-is-at-war-paris-attacks-video ) at war . 
  and warring terrorism is like warring the [ sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caligula#britannia )  state of emergency is very similar in france to a state of war . 
  that 's why and how it was created . 
   to make a new thing , you 'd need to change the constitution . 
  [ things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_dictator ) [ change ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julius_caesar ), 
  `` first they came for the terrorists , but i did not speak out '', 
  yeah , this one is probably too big to be kept , still when that right returns , there 'll be some caveats to it that were not there before , and those will not go away so soon . 
  still , prolonged states of emergency becoming the norm are not a new thing by any means . 
  i 'm kind of divided here to be quite honest , but i can see the reason . 
  popper said it better than i ever could though '' ( ... ) i do not imply , for instance , that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies ; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion , suppression would certainly be unwise . 
  but we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force ; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument , but begin by denouncing all argument ; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument , because it is deceptive , and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols .
