  and even then it depends on the demographic . 
  not being racist here , just going by statistics really , asians for example are extremely profitable in the long turn , because they tend to get children extremely qualified , so their income skyrockets . 
  if you are of the same religion ( group , ck2 ftw ) or come speaking the same language you also are in a good position . 
  if neither of these is true , it depends on the initial conditions of the migrant . 
  tl ; dr you do n't import workers , you import people , and people are conditioned by the society they come from . 
  if you import people from broken or dissonant societies you 'll get broken or dissonant workers down the line . 
  tl ; dr tl ; dr. fucked up people do fucked up decisions, 
  this is not bonding . 
  this is [ desenrascan\u00e7o ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/desenrascan%c3%a7o ) the ancestral [ portuguese ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zutmfmy.jpg ) art of macgyvering it in a half-assed way . 
  and it is . 
  at first i was going to say something like * in portugal * they help . 
  their logic is that the influx can be used to offset the projected collapse of the social security system due to low birthrates, 
  and her solution is to keep them coming by the hundred thousand , give them massive welfare and allow for ghettos to be formed so they can radicalize all the better in their peer pressured unemployment ? 
  explain to me how anyone thought this was a good move ? 
  there 's an extreme victimization complex and an ideological denial in the left that worries me , because i 'm in the left . 
  and digging our heads in the sand does nothing , this idea of refusing to consider the effects that migration policies have , not only in a demographic and cultural level , but also in things that the left has the historical duty of caring about like the fall of lower and middle class paychecks is outraging . 
  while we have these blinkers on , idiots like le pen and wilders only win points . 
  i do n't think that would fly here . 
  this week in a big debate , the chief ( and only ) imam of lisbon admitted on national tv that multiculturalism is a failure . 
  ** portugal offered to receive 4754 refugees . 
  only 50 accepted , full translation below : ** & nbsp ; image caption : since last week , the 12 syrian and sudanese children already go to school in penela & nbsp ; ** country might receive 4754 people , but until christmas only 50 are set to come . 
  in europe , 700 were relocated , out of a total of 160 thousand ** & nbsp ; until october , over 700 refugees were already relocated in european countries , and there 's a plan for another 160k to be distributed by the european countries . 
  but truth is , they are long due to arrive at the nations that showed themselves available to welcome them . 
  bureaucratic difficulties and the refuse to travel are the pointed justifications . 
  portugal provided to receive 4754 , but only 50 should arrive by christmas : 30 from italy and 20 from greece . 
  * which would already be quite good * said to dn [ the newspaper ] a director of the * servi\u00e7o de estrangeiros e fronteiras ( sef ) * [ portuguese border and migration police ] . 
  and the number of relocated people wo n't reach two hundred in this timeframe & nbsp ; to try and change this situation , the portuguese ambassador in greece , rui alberto tereno , was this week in a sort of charm operation in the kos island camp . 
  the trip had the objective of explaining the refugees there -- in august the number reached 7k -- how is the country that they can find here . 
  & nbsp ; * the relocation process is having troubles . 
  the responsibilities are attributed to the italian and greek authorities , which is in part true , but one of the main reasons has to do with the fact that the asylum applicants do n't wish to be relocated * explained to dn lu\u00eds gouveia , national assistant director of sef . 
  the representative associations of civil society say that that is an hardship , but not the main reason . 
  they accuse the european model of being too static and slow for a very dynamic process & nbsp ; big blue text : ** one of the main reasons has to do with the fact that asylum seekers do n't wish to be relocated ** [ t.n. 
  : ffs ] & nbsp ; two months after 14 member states [ of the eu ] agreed upon resettling 160k refugees , most is still in welcoming are registration centers in italy and greece . 
  the governments are doing the maths and realizing that the system is not working as expediently as intended . 
  so it is in portugal . 
  the work group created by the government shall present this week a balance and the plataforma de apoio aos refugiados ( par ) [ refugees support platform ] shall emit a statement about the issue . 
  the overwhelming majority [ t.l , lit . 
  crushing majority -_- ] of asylum seekers that transit through europe want to leave for germany or sweden , where many have a family and/or received the information that there 's work there and they can get a good standard of living . 
  the preference always goes to the countries of the north -- the iberian peninsula is unknown [ t.n. 
  since 1493 ] . more recently it was attempted to send 40 asylum seekers to spain by plane , but only 12 accepted . 
  & nbsp ; ** contacting local centers ** & nbsp ; andr\u00e9 costa jorge , director of the servi\u00e7o jesu\u00edta aos refugiados [ jesuit refugee service ] believes that there is some difficulty in convincing refugees to head to certain countries , namely portugal . 
  but the biggest responsibility is the bureaucratization of the system , that passes every immigrant through several hoops before they 're resettled in each country [ t.n. 
  some messed up sentence formation here ] . 
  he defends , that like england did , portuguese authorities should directly contact the centers where the triage of the asylum seekers situation is being done through bilateral deals with greece and italy . 
  the result , he criticizes , is that less than 200 refugees were resettled . 
  & nbsp ; portugal has two liasion officers working this matter -- [ in ] athens and rome -- , besides an inspector in the european asylum bureau and 12 others in the european borders agency ( frontex ) . 
  the main conclusion is that the relocation process * will take a long time * the european comission emited a statement of the current state of affairs , considering the proposed measures * will reduce in a significant , although partial , the pressure under the most affected member states * , stressing : * it 's fundamental for the eu to demonstrate that it can reestablish the good workings of the migrant system * & nbsp ; ** article by c\u00e9u neves in diario de noticias ** & nbsp ; - egoipse, 
  oh ... you have n't seen [ nothing ] ( http://rudhar.com/foneport/en/noteport/notep016.htm ) yet `` que t\u00eam ou h\u00e1 um ano tiveram '' is pronouced as an octophthong, 
  two words : bebe \u00e1gua, 
  do n't forget boris johnson . 
  they already chat at the salon, 
  western spain . 
  triggered, 
  not only the ukrainian . 
  their coverage of the syrian civil war is phenomenal , regardless of whom you 're comparing them to . 
  they are on the ground and covering all factions in the conflict, 
  sad when `` no known motive '' has become an euphemism . 
  that makes sense . 
  thanks for pointing that out !, 
  :d fixed still , that was really badly thought out writing, 
  here goes a quick translation . 
  please point out any errors you may find . 
  & nbsp ; ** two seventeen year old twin iraqi brothers were released today after being detained by the pj ( pol\u00edcia judici\u00e1ria -- t.n.

  thanks u/escaimbra, 
  first of all , my thoughts are to the victims of this violence secondly , why are we hypocrites really ? 
  for not toeing erdogan 's line ? 
  if so , then yes . 
  huge hypocrites . 
  but , for my part , i condemn any terrorist act , regardless of who 's doing it . 
  but saying that you despise terrorism does not mean i do n't think that the kurdish people deserve a country of their own . 
  they do . 
  or at least , a lot more autonomy and a lot less oppression . 
  and it 's not only the kurds , mind you . 
  i 'm consistent on my opinion for the basque and others . 
  if there 's a ethnic group with an historic claim on the land they live in , and it is their wish to be independent , then they should . 
  they should not however , ever do this sort of thing . 
  oh , and btw , there 's a critical difference between groups like pkk , eta or ira and daesh or al-qaeda . 
  the first have a limited , finite goal , whilst the second have an unlimited , unbounded goal . 
  and that makes them unable to seat at a table and talk peace . 
  is this r/subredditsimulator ? 
  i can not say that at all , but given that any diaspora will try to keep in contact with the homeland , probably not completely unreliable . 
  syria/iraq , where the woman quite likely came from . 
  iirc they 're kurdish / pro-kurdish and pop up a lot at r/syriancivilwar . 
  i ca n't seem to remember how accurate they are , but they do report a lot from the region , so they 're probably not the worst source, 
  and [ this one ] ( http://www.creativeboom.com/uploads/articles/47/47326c51db32868e9d49ad03b5bf69ff735b19a8_860.jpg ) is most likely somewhere on the spanish side of the border, 
  bellum ( war , accusative ) did n't change to modern words in latin languages for war . 
  although it subsists in more formal or erudit terms like ( b\u00e9lico ( portuguese and spanish adjective for pertaining to war ) or belicoso ( bellicose ) , the modern words ( guerra , guerre , etc. ), 
  come from the late latin * werra , adopted from germanic ( possibly frankish ) from the proto-germanic * werro ( confusion ) . 
  it is a root in pie ( * wers - `` to mix up , confuse , beat , thresh '' ), 
  that sounds almost like puta . 
  which is portuguese for whore . 
  lovely, 
  we do [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_people_in_france ) all the time,
