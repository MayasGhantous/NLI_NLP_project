they show the rainbow . 
  why stop there , lets blame god for all the rain mixing with them sun lights and ban rainbows altogether, 
  i had a nokia 1100 for ages , and would still have one if work/uni didnt require me to upgrade . 
  that battery lasted 2 weeks , and it had a flashlight , its tiny , barely feel it in my pocked . 
  our goverment is giving them a run for their money , now wanting to fire 3 % of all goverment staff in every region of the country . 
  together we can do it !, 
  public uni are the good ones , except maybe catholic university for business/economy, 
  no , it really inst , its roughly 80 euros a month , and the student is paying something like 5-10 % of the actual cost to keep a student enrolled, 
  it is , really affordable , and thats not counting the incentives to study . 
  i worked summers to pay for my university and a new laptop/tablet every year while i was studying and lived with my parents otherwise . 
  lunch and dinner at uni is 2.40 $ a meal . 
  the students that had homes further away can get housing as cheap as 70 $ month with assistance from university programs . 
  really , superior education is not an issue in portugal . 
  and i just finished my masters degree in july from instituto superior t\u00e9cnico, 
  sry , but tuition is cheap as hell , and u can always apply for student/worked perms and get loads of discounts . 
  my university is just starting a program that drop out students get 1200 $ / year to return to their studies . 
  university education in portugal is not a problem, 
  yeah , buts its probably a very common surname , it is in portuguese ( matos , mata ) , and its understood that is in relation to trees, 
  mato probably means more woods or small forest, 
  i laughed , but then i was sad , because there are ppl that actually think this . 
  it 's a beautiful city tho, 
  some sentences they change it from us , but not that particular one , sounds to bad in my mouth without something else following it . 
  ftfy, 
  shit loads of this tombs around , i got one just 200m from my door , no contactor dares build anything there afraid of finding more shit, 
  its perfect , why mess with it, 
  i dont know how many times i 've said this but , secrecy is only good if lobbyist are out of the negotiations aswell , as long as they are n't then secrecy means 0 for everyone but corporations, 
  i overheard a conversation between 2 brazilians in the us planning to steal my phone and run for it , i just said hi brother with a brazilian accent and they fucked off, 
  ah , the brits and fat birds , figures, 
  depends , a full cozido yes , i only make mine with some core ingredients , cabbage , potato , blood sausage , chourizo , farinheira , and meat . 
  some other vegetables in there like carrots and the like, 
  dont they have the leave no man behind moto too ? 
  well , i can give u a simple one from portugal , a coffee used to cost 50 escudos ( 25 cents ) , the day we changed to the euro it started costing 50 cents , effectively doubling in price over night, 
  portugal , ireland , italy , spain ... ... ... ... 
  ofc , i meant the countries already in the euro ,  fiscal union to ** accompany ** the monetary union sorry for the confusion, 
  i agree that would be hard , but with baby steps we might get there . 
  i 'm all for losing sovereignty in some matters , as long as it can prevent shit shows such as the last 5 years, 
   i 'm not sure i understand - what else would be in the ez ? 
  i think we are in agreement , i was just answering this comment from you, 
  might not be now , or not even in the next 50 years , but if eu as a whole reaches a point of of federation with basically the rest of the continent with a monetary , fiscal , and parliamentary union the uk will be hard pressed not to join . 
  it would be a massive bear hug by the rest of europe . 
  having said that some countries should n't have joined the euro so soon without these unions , namely mine and greece, 
  because if you keep fucking up the ez countries , maybe the rest wont be so inclined to join ? 
  which does n't let the euro grow, 
  the rest of eu that is n't in there yet ? 
  poland etc. ... 
  these 2 ones in particular , edp and ren always made a profit , the late tap ( air travel ) has n't , some ppl speculate that it has n't made profit ( only lately ) because they wanted to sell it ( and tastes better to the public selling an inefficient company ), 
  you do understand that this companies were generating profit , how can that not be maintained ? 
  a branch of the government that deals with accounting said recently that 2 of the companies sold could generate the money of the sale in 12 years, 
  probably basic needs such as water , electricity , sewer system . 
  its so that the foreign billionaires can come in and swoop everything on a fire sale , much like portugal . 
  keeping public companies aparently is being too `` leftist '', 
  i was referencing the ultimatum england did to portugal about splitting africa ... ... . 
  it worked for us , bastard, 
  they ca n't implement them during talks , one the stipulations or whatever . 
  they have n't implemented loads of shit they need to do for the past 5 months, 
  the lack of transparency would n't bother me one bit if lobbyists were n't in the negotiations, 
  at this point , being different and unwilling to change . 
  there is a reason no scientist uses imperial system , unless they need to explain something to the yanks, 
  ah , the double dip , when add revenue from ppl clicking the links is n't enought, 
  with petrol included , 70 $ tank x2 , rest is in tolls, 
  its not that i like ps , because i dont , but we really do n't have a long term positive economic or financial improvement . 
  those roads piss me off so much , roundback trip to my grandparents costs me 400 $ , they were meant to divert traffic from populated zones , because ppl complained about the noise from trucks , they were suposed to be free as they were made with eu money by a stupid amount ( like 2million/km ) . 
  i think even eu said it wasnt constitutional to put tolls on those roads , but there is nothing they can do, 
  its the romanian that i found baffling , its hate from pretty much every post i see, 
  but does he shine like a diamond when hit with the sun ? 
  everything that eu can do besides threats to no more bailouts they have done , which is money loans with conditions , for anything more ( that is meaningful ) we need to create an european agency that can override sovereignty in certain aspects . 
  like a european fiscal policy , and means to police the eu funds , because unfortunately i do n't trust my government with eu money . 
  the problem is that we are not the same nation , nor a centralized government , europe ca n't force anything on any country , that is perhaps part of the problem, 
  privatization of water and electricity worked like shit in portugal , its estimated that in 12 years we could have made that money and more profit out of it , then they went and privatized more shit , its unreal . 
  well the euro is an experiment , and now after some 15 years we can see that it is failing because you ca n't share a monetary policy without a fiscal one . 
  either steps are taken for the next 10years to create a european fiscal policy or greece will only be the first casualty, 
  the thing is polls are incredibly accurate if done right and honestly , to less than 1 % margin of error, 
  the amount of hate from romanian is staggering , and i only really started tunning in this morning . 
  i 'm agaisnt any deal that politicians make in secret ** with ** lobyists, 
  i 'll ship it to you if u pay for the delivery costs , i 'll even make you a video of my grandparents working on the olive trees, 
  olive oil is healthier tho , i grill all mine anyway, 
  so much self-righteousness i gagged, 
  obviously not seeing as greece is filled with corruption, 
  now you are just being retarded . 
  did you miss the part it said `` based of the irs . 
  i 'm not saying write blanks checks , simply demand supervision and reforms needed to ensure the money is not misspent , something my country could have used when we were building ridiculous highways and other european funded projects, 
  ofc it makes a difference , as for the first part  pay taxes , reject corruption , stop oligarchy this should be done regardless of situation , but  diversify your economy , invest in industry and increase the age of retirement to 67 other than age of retirement its not feasible with austerity, 
  this post should be on the top, 
  japan doesnt share a currency with the rest of asia, 
  2 submarines were bought from the germain submarine consortium . 
  everyone knows its a corrupt deal but you cant really touch them while they are in government . 
  fun fact : greece bought 2 submarines too, 
  i enjoyed myself in milan for some reason , but have to mention gotenburg ( dont know how to make that double dot thing ), 
  i have a problem pronouncing lincoln or world , comes off alright if i say world of warcraft , but standalone and sounds like gibberish, 
  these are n't wandering gypsies , these are the kind that stroll thro a supermarket eating everything they want inside and leaving the wrappers and the security guard does n't do anything about it because he is afraid of retaliation, 
  relatively frequently between the 2 same schmucks, 
  rtp tried not to , they got basically censured , guess its what happens when u are owned by the state, 
  ods were n't the main reason this went forward , check out the aids transmission rates prior to 2001 and after and you should be more lucky with results , also with decriminalization came funds for syringes , any addict can go to a pharmacy and ask for free syringes . 
  went down by a lot , also we were leading aids infected charts at the end of the century for europe , and we might have the lowest now, 
  how did you conclude that quality is better ? 
  drugs are still illegal, 
  just across the border in portugal kids ca n't go to daycare/schools if their vaccines are n't up to date . 
  at least i remember having to present my vaccines booklet in every new school , and in some cases for sports too , like swimming and judo when i was young . 
  do n't kid yourself mate , england is non-factor, 
  not entirely sure , i think the teams can ask to spare a player , but its on the player not to play for a nation , or the manager not to call him to the nation .
