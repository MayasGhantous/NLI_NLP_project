thanks for the advice , i have been interested in a career change lately . 
  a coup is orchestrated by agents within the existing power structure , a revolution is a mass uprising of agents outside the power structure , ukraine has elements of both but seeing as the government is largely the same people , calling it a coup is more appropriate . 
  great show of strength in ukraine then . 
  look at the bright side mate , in the new europe we get to have slaves woohooo . 
  yes , it 's not like the russians have been quiet about not liking the eu expansion towards them , ukraine was just a step to far . 
  this is one of those times that sarcasm is n't easily conveyed . 
  they did n't sack him they engaged in a coup d'etat . 
   we already did that by accepting baltic states into eu and nato . 
  seems hypocritical to stop now . 
  the provocation led to the war but let 's keep going , what more can the russians do ? 
  the dancing my sides . 
  this guy looks to friendly to be singing the shit he is singing . 
  the only irish guy i know is called patrick . 
   sorry but after a few years in the nordics i 've been reformed sounds like you have stockholm syndrome mate . 
  i think this is a scandinavian in joke . 
  way to shatter my [ vision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muumxb0qnyo ) of you guys . 
   dispationate . 
  why would the trains not have passion ? 
  virtue signalling , they will say anything to appear more virtuous than others but then move as far away as possible from the migrants . 
   anyways , usa seems to be awfully silent about all this ? 
  they have spent a year `` fighting '' isis , i do n't think that they are in a position to complain . 
  ahh sweden , keep on being the example for all of europe . 
  thanks . 
   land of hope and glory not a fan of what i have seen , chorus is to short intro to long , but jerusalem is magic . 
  behind paywall . 
  `` rule uganda , uganda rules the waves !, 
  uagandan 's never , ever , ever , ever shall be slaves . '', 
  maybe dress assad in baby clothes ? 
  that 's not exactly blaming all immigrants though is it ? 
   and its definitely not like the gullible would lap up something that fits their notion of refugees all being maniacs . 
  that 's a strawman though , i have never encountered anyone who says that . 
   what is the problem with multiculturalism ? 
  * it can only exist in a wealthy nation . 
  * it creates an inherently unstable nation . 
  * the culture of the host nation must needs be suppressed in-order for the other cultures to be represented . 
  from what i have observed multiculturalism just balkanizes a country , there is self segregation taking place , white flight is the term used for this and it is occurring in prosperous countries with the media constantly trumpeting the virtues of a more diverse society . 
  what is the story behind this ? 
  why do n't you go find out for us . 
  mexican clay . 
  texas . 
   cricket used to be fairly popular , but it was obliterated by the gaa rule prohibiting people from playing `` garrison games '' . 
  this is something to be proud of ? 
  that flair , such hypocrisy . 
  google is `` working on this '' too . 
  what exactly is the point ? 
  fair enough . 
  what the largest group immigrating to europe thinks is not connected to europe ? 
  a goldplated turd is still a turd . 
  you agree with me , good . 
   tomorrow it will decide if it ** wants to be a state ** or not . 
   but we are now members of the eu . 
  spain is in the eu , leaving spain means leaving all the things spain is part of , this is basic common sense man . 
   catalonia is inside the eu . 
  spain is in the eu , at this point in time there is no country called catalonia . 
  once again there is no `` asking '' being done . 
   eu is ** asking ** from eastern member states bare minimum . 
  it 's not asking anything and it is in no way clear that this is the minimum . 
   this does not mean we should just shut up and be grateful that `` ze evil berlin '' does n't push more refugees onto us . 
  the point of this comparison is to illustrate how germany , france and other western countries are leading by example . 
  you do n't seem to understand what most people have a problem with . 
  ** no country has the right to force such a permanent change onto another . 
   eighty went to university, 
  if only he had a darker skin tone then he too might qualify for some of that european compassion . 
  pallywood comes to europe . 
   many were remarkably well-educated . 
  going by the perpetrators of terror attacks this is pretty standard . 
   of the 670 cases scrutinized , 234 jihadists returned to germany , and 23 are currently in jail . 
  why are they allowed to return ? 
  not drinking the koolade with you bud . 
   not an anti-migration wall  it 's a wall to keep demographics separate huh ? 
  you do n't just build cities you need jobs for these people and considering the fact that abut 20 to 30 % of jobs will be automated in the next few decades good luck with that . 
   surely europe can do something better than placing the world 's poor there is a never ending supply of the worlds poor , would you have europe let them in until europeans are just as poor ? 
  [ what does christopher hitchens the prophet have to say on this ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yj0xfpu6hgw?t=5m36s ), 
  yes dancing . 
   germans only want to be able to identify with an `` identity that wants them '' . 
  they do n't want want them . 
  just in theory , theoretically . 
  theoretically they have no upper limit and welcome the whole world . 
  you know , practicality can not be a consideration when talking about morals ... 
  i think that this is pretty much covers the entire `` western '' world . 
   racist . 
  why beat around the bush for so long , now you finally get to what you wanted to say all along . 
  middle east and north africa yes , the rest of africa no . 
  [ kokia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0jm5izhauq ) gives me goosebumps . 
  not in a cemetery , it 's sort of a social norm throughout the world not to treat the graves of others with disrespect . 
  really ? 
  if the goal is to stop deaths at sea then this is the logical conclusion we come to . 
  what does far right entail , nazis ? 
   you you actually believe your own bullshit ? 
  yup it 's called my opinion , and insulting me is n't going to make me change my mind any time soon . 
  the migrants in question would be the ones on the boats , if you are qualified you have no need to take a boat to europe . 
  france and comedy , nope i do n't see it . 
  if you had told me ten years ago that something like five eyes was around , i would have labeled you as a conspiracy nut . 
  remember during the financial crisis how the `` market '' wo n't like this or that . 
  it is a dream of mine , but i think that my hairy backside would get in the way of the message . 
  so low skilled illigal economic migrant 's offer the same benefits to germany that highly trained legal migrant 's do ? 
  i too have an idea for some top quality art , first clean out your guts and then drink a shit load of edible paint , then you ejaculate this under high pressure from the anus onto a suitable canvas . 
  this would be a commentary on the modern capitalist society . 
  what do you think guys ?
