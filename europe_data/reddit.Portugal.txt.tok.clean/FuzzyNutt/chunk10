  obviously they are going to where the money is . 
   are you claiming that all refugees are stealing , throwing away food , etc. ? 
  straight to the straw-man tactics , not once did i say that ** all ** the migrants are doing this but judging from the video evidence in multiple countries at multiple times , it is not an isolated thing . 
   it 's that most people who have these radical and ignorant opinion on reddit are american . 
  yes , i know it 's a pretty biased and small sample , but it fits to reddit . 
  on an american website , the majority of the people are americans , next you will be telling me that in austria there are lots of austrians , unbelievable . 
  like i said , you are an ideologue , there is nothing short of experience that can change your mind , and even then you would find a way to justify whatever [ conflicts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/haj0gct.gifv ) with your world-view . 
   this refugee crisis might fail so hard that the political backlash will be a very strict and possibly xenophobic immigration policy for europe in the coming decades . 
  i fear that the nice prosperous and tolerant europe that we know and love is gone forever , either those in favour of mass immigration get their way and blend europe into some islamic concoction or europeans become closed and hostile . 
   safety is n't everything . 
  you still need to eat , drink and sleep somewhere . 
  so very true , it is a shame that hungary , austria , germany and denmark are unable to look after these people . 
  someone should do titeuf holding his nose up at the hungarians , austrians , germans and dutch saying `` pas assez bon '' ( google translate , do n't hurt me ) . 
  if video evidence of these people stealing , throwing away food and demanding to pass through to places were they can get the best welfare is n't enough then nothing but time will teach you the error of your ways . 
  cnn does n't do propaganda subtle i see . 
   entitlement from what i 've seen this is in no short supply . 
   it seems safe to assume that the 200 million scenario simply wo n't happen ; the width of the mediterranean alone makes that hard to imagine , to say nothing of what 's likely to happen in european domestic politics . 
  ** but then if you had predicted a few years ago that germany would be accepting hundreds of thousands , and possibly millions , of mostly-muslim refugees during a single period of crisis , that would have seemed fairly implausible as well ** . 
  and ** this crisis does n't have to repeat itself exactly to set a precedent that attracts the young , the adventurous , the ambitious , and the wired-in and social-media-savvy ** from countries ** where they might do well enough if they stayed , but where no matter how they worked and saved they could never hope to have it as good as the average european . 
   during a period in which the mexican population doubled , growing by about 60 million people , an additional 10 million ( on a net basis ) migrated to the united states . 
  applying comparable ratios to africa and europe , between now and 2050 nearly 200 million africans would be expected to migrate to europe . 
  between one in four and one in five europeans would be african immigrants . 
  nice . 
  a year before 9/11 . 
  do n't know but to put it in perspective , when i left the highest bill was a $ 100 note and before they changed to foreign currency they had a trillion dollar note . 
  does a bear shit in the woods if no one is there to see it ? 
  it doesnt matter how scary headlines you have about murder or rape , crime is decreasing . 
  so its not true that people throw grenades at each other in certain swedish cities ? 
  i see your american talking about sweden and i 'll raise you a muslim/exmuslim ? 
  in sweden talking about [ sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xg30xdmz8q ) . 
  must be american humour . 
  its a german flag . 
   zimbabwe can confirm , former resident of said country . 
  it 's hard to imagine that once it was 8 to 1 with the australian dollar and this was about 15 years ago . 
   and we are talking about 20,000 over 5 years . 
  how do you know this ? 
  nobody said last year that 800,000 would come this year , numbers could be more or less ( heh ) so countries could very well take in much more than the 160,000 that was first bandied about . 
  what 's to say that 2 years from now the big economies say they have too much and opt out of the quota for a few years ? 
   ` germanistan ' i prefer germoney my self . 
  that 's what she said . 
   pc - anti-racist muslim fundementalists ? 
  d = did n't some woman and her son get such treatment recently , the guy in question is supposed to have done it because he was due to be deported to italy . 
   i 've read so many just blatant lies in the last few days about germany on here its sickening ... 
  it could be that what the german politicians are saying is targeted at the domestic audience , but there is a much much wider group paying attention and western media like to spin the stories to their own narratives . 
  as they say ' a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes . ', 
  looks like the eussr has decided to [ tame ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbw3b9tiuri ) the wild swiss . 
  i thought you guys wanted the diversity , why the scramble to spread it around ? 
  and frances plan to get rid of ~ ~ gaddafi ~ ~ assad will fix everything right ? 
  the guy is a racist with an agenda . 
  i was just commenting on the hypocrisy of it . 
   germany can deal with several million syrian refugees demographically , but ** it ca n't necessarily deal with the long-term outcomes . 
  ** so ** it is precisely because of this risk that the change is so impressive . 
  **  in the name of justice and morality , in the name of the desire to give humans freedom , ** germany is taking a huge gamble . 
  it may be committing suicide . 
  ** the far ** right will gain power ** , the immigrants will have an influence , ** the country will change . 
  ** so he recognozes that this will make germany/europe move more to the right and yet he still sees it as a good thing , why ? 
   in the past few years i have met german politicians and cooperated with german academics - and yet something has gone wrong in my system . 
  ** when i meet a german person i ca n't help but think about the origin of his family , and there is not a single time i hear german without thinking about the murderous voices my family members heard seven decades ago . 
  ** this is why , it might also be why [ this woman does it aswell ] ( https://youtu.be/mfe0qaiofmq?t=39s ), 
   if the israeli government would have been able to think first , netanyahu - like begin at the time - would have offered to take in several hundred druze or christians are temporary residents , not more , ** for the photo opportunity and the image . 
  ** some callous shit right there . 
   israel ca n't take in refugees now - and could n't take in refugees in the past either . 
  ** the demographic threat is real ** , and the need to preserve the jewish nation state 's character as a democracy does n't allow for large minorities . 
  and yet it is perfectly fine to offload african refugees onto sweden . 
  eu : `` borders , what are those ? '', 
   integrate and interbreed white women are only good as girlfriends , the wives must be good muslim girls from back home . 
   the fine line distinguishing `` military experts '' from trainers or troops capable of taking direct part in combat has added to western worries . 
  was n't the `` west '' sending trainers to ukraine ? 
   in before countless comments raging about how we give refugees actually decent places to live . 
  and those `` refugees '' will turn their noses up at this and go to where they get more benefits . 
   they 're coming because they want germoney . 
   think of your children and culcha !, 
  somebody has to . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w2guacjc3e hue hue hue . 
   you think insulting people in an institution devoted to civil discourse is a good thing ? 
  most parliamentarians behave like spoilt brats . 
   serious question ( even if not very seriously worded ) , which country can we flee to before western europe is turned to shit by the oncoming onslaught of ( the following statement is relative ) uncultured , uneducated , very religious , barbaric people about to set back the development of our economy and culture by 300 years ? 
  israel , strict immigration policy even going so far as to send african migrants to europe . 
  we will probably have to rename the place , kingdom of jerusalem sounds nice . 
  september has been a good month for drama . 
  that young man , reality did n't live up to the hype . 
   but i forgot that european architecture now means soulless concrete blocks and big glass windows . 
  i despise what passes for `` culture '' these days , basically if its ugly or inscrutable but preferably both then it 's `` art '' . 
   the eritrean who confessed to the ikea murders in vasteras , sweeden recently where he knifed a mother and her son to death using ikea knives has said that he only committed the murders because the migration board decided that he would be deported to italy . 
  probably get a slap on the wrist . 
   curiosity , is there a dialogue to absorb cultural developments from brazil ? 
  or is brazil looked down upon with nothing to learn from in portugal ( or is my terminology so off ? 
  i do n't hear about the luthosphere here in aus ? 
  i grew up in africa watching skippy and listening to fado , and then emigrated to australia . 
  :p probably have to ask a real portuguese about that one . 
   i still feel like we 're culturally poor and need to absorb as much as we can from other countries . 
  in regards to this i feel that australians have their own uniqueness , time will take care of the rest . 
  what do the dutch call a pole in the water , a swimming pool . 
  not a very informative source then . 
  hue hue hue . 
  fort hood , the government call 's it workplace violence . 
  where is the source for the graph and is there one for the preceding years ? 
   the us was pretty successful with the integration of people from muslim countries , which shows that it is possible if done right . 
  the us gets to choose which muslims go there and even then there are still ~ ~ terrorist attacks ~ ~ workplace violence . 
  mr. k. should focus on the root cause of this nationalism , the only way to cure it is to of course remove humanity .
