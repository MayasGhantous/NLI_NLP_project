  fortunately for mr. k. i have a tall building on which he can begin this task . 
  western europe has failed to integrate the muslims amongst them , what sane person would engage in an endeavour that has been proven not to work ? 
  british universities have a tendency to have some very radical people come and speak in front of the various muslim societies . 
  on the flip side any views opposed to the leftist orthodoxy is liable to be no platformed . 
  sweden has to fight to keep `` humanitarian superpower '' status , france probably ate one of those hallucinogenic frogs . 
   there will come a time when germany will decrease the number of refugees we take . 
  this here is part of the problem i see with the quota 's , when you are topped up on your labour force you will then put pressure on the rest of the eu to take `` their share of the burden . '', 
  especially the kinky sex . 
   yes , it sucks that balanced voices get buried in the choir of redneck voices . 
  must be nice to just dismiss those who have a differing opinion as racists/rednecks , unfortunately for me i try to understand the other side as well . 
  and mass immigration is not a long term solution either . 
  the long and short term social problems are not worth the band aid that is mass immigration . 
   ` for life ' we do not intend to host them for life something something , guest workers . 
  at the moment there is one of developed nation which is not going the population replacement route and that is japan , i have noticed on and off quite a lot of propaganda and pressure put on the japanese government to open the borders as it were . 
  i 'll probably have to partition the place again . 
  if my intended goal is to increase refugees out of syria i would remove assad , just like if i wanted to increase migrants in the mediterranean i would have taken out gaddafi . 
  it is disingenuous to just portray europe 's migrant problem as only a syrian refugee problem . 
  if you want people to harden themselves against any and all migrants then continue with such propaganda . 
  those young guys in the class talking about how women must obey them , the future looks bright for deutschland . 
  degenerate . 
  so by saying asian you lump the entirety of asia in with these scum , next time a sikh is a victim of a racist attack because he was `` asian '' will you respond in the same cavalier manner ? 
   you need n't be in the edl to point this out . 
  in fact , the edl is probably going to go with `` those filthy pakis are inherently evil '' , rather than any rational explanation . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayd9qbrz2fc this is why the edl started in the first place , the response to this guy was to make fun of how uneducated he was . 
   no , we are all affected by immigration . 
  business thrives because they get skilled workers and people who are working get exposed to a wider base of opinions . 
  ** what i 'm saying is people who live in shitty bedsits surrounded by asylum seekers and other unemployed people who have no skills at all are a group of people i 'm not concerned about and would n't want to associate with . 
  ** this is what one of the starbucks crowd thinks about his poor countrymen . 
  when i pointed out that many of the migrants that he is championing are also `` unemployed people who have no skills '' i got no reply . 
  will do it now . 
   does anyone seriously think that the core point of my post -- that a society should be welcoming to newcomers so as to aid their integration -- is fundamentally wrong ? 
  no , the problems begin when you are unable to integrate or properly house the ones already in the country and yet still have the one of the highest intakes per capita in europe . 
  read up on sweden , search for malmo and the grenade attacks that happen in that city , yes you read that right ** grenade attacks ** . 
  not even america has those . 
  wrong name same flag . 
  i 'd wager mine is the more realistic expectation , you on the other hand are being disingenuous when you just say 5000 . 
  it 's true they are not real numbers , but it serves to illustrate that no one knows how many people will come and how many people countries will be forced to take once they are under obligation to take them . 
  3 times is spamming ? 
  is n't isis wahabis and the muslim brotherhood salafists ? 
   his clothes do n't look very jihadist though . 
  do they have a uniform ? 
  5000 this year , 20000 the next , the year after that its 80000 , etcetera etcetera . 
   same numbers as japan 6 . 
  what the hell , you can make anything into television . 
  how popular is this , and is it only in norway ? 
  guy with a gun in syria , totally innocent , he probably went hunting deer or something . 
  is it true that they have shows on wood chopping ? 
   ( eire is irish for burden while \u00c9ire is irish for ireland ) . 
  although the bbc still does this . 
  i did n't know the pom 's were such trolls . 
  ok , but at the very least it is an insult akin to saying that they are amoral . 
  `` no no my good sir , svalbard is where all the most beautiful swedish live , their hair is so pale it looks white . '', 
  i will graciously concede the third guy , but civilian clothing means nothing . 
  i 'm going to run out of popcorn if this shit goes on for much longer . 
  what do you call something without values ? 
  the bbc says he was a member of the fsa , but the fsa lost a lot of support to the islamist fighters namely al quaida and al nusra , al nusra joined up with what is now isis . 
  so no we have no idea . 
  https://youtu.be/rgimjy8v0ja?t=32s look at this guy , he 's begging the leaders in europe to do something before he has to . 
  what did he have to go through that he is considering what he is ? 
  the point being that we do n't know what these guys got up to in syria , the third guy is former fsa but is he part of the guys that went to al nusra or what ? 
  show the proper context then . 
  the video bellow was taken on the island in which the first 2 photos are from . 
  not every immigrant is from syria or iraq , compassion is a finite resource if you keep spending it on economic migrants then the real refugees will loose out as well . 
  i too was trying for the subtle sarcasm . 
   this whole ` lazy greedy immigrant ' vision posting in a thread about said greedy immigrants busy shopping for benefits . 
   protested that is the problem , not how peaceful they are ,, 
  bongistan is the next destination . 
  where , in australia ? 
  lot 's of canadians have been boasting to me today about how excellent they are at integration . 
  i 'd pay to see this . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiwvwamhzfw&amp;list=plh0nzxcxkux6t1vlzejzplsnakugrcc6i&amp;index=29 black dick is expensive i hear . 
   except freedom of movement that is a pretty big ask . 
  what war is there in west africa at the moment ? 
  how would this be any different than people coming over on a work visa ? 
  as a canadian ** you ** get to ** choose ** who comes . 
   , he wants to allow asylum seekers to work and earn money while they are being processed this right here is what you do if you want to encourage even more coming, 
  it always pisses me off when people use the crusade 's as an example of ebil christians . 
   violent periods with the crusades it should be noted that these were a response to islams expansion , the middle east and north africa were at one point largely christian . 
  the guy likes tolkien , he ca n't be all bad . 
  i am not defending her , merely pointing out an alternative viewpoint . 
  it has been going on for at least a decade and the number 's are increasing . 
  when i get home i 'll give it a watch . 
  why do you assume three years ? 
  and who said that it would stay at such low numbers ? 
  she probably does n't get much practice kicking people and so delivered a disproportionate amount of force in the kick . 
  why so upset , do n't you want the refugees ? 
  then the year after that and so on and so forth , there is no end in sight . 
   if you watch the video it seems that the migrants where breaking through police lines and running away . 
  do n't most country 's have citizens arrest rights ? 
  i mean the police ultimately derive their power 's from the consent of the people to be governed ,, 
  they are on some powerful drug 's methinks . 
  i am an agnostic but i also recognise that my world view is shaped by the christian culture that surrounds me . 
  i thought i was having a conversation about one thing and you changed we we were talking about mid way , i 'm sorry i 'm not as quick thinking as you u/afirejar senpai . 
  every time i notice the benis i picture some tall blonde 's pissing on little engerland . 
  well going by the track record on `` nation building '' , we do n't seem to have a clue how exactly to go about this . 
  i do n't know you have confused me . 
  why the straw man ? 
  i am merely pointing out the fact that people can get a certain idea based on the words and actions of the german government and people , they are absolutely one hundred percent free to do what they want , just do n't try to parcel out the people who are coming because of the impression that has been given to them . 
  get a permanent tan , get to germany and say that you are syrian , profit . 
  let 's not forget the coming robot revolution , lot 's of jobs have already been replaced by machines .
