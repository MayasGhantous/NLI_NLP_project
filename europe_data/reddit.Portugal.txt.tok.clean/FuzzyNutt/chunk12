  what did he say ? 
  the media and the way they present what german politicians say is part of it , then you have quite a few football ultras holding massive banners welcoming refugees . 
  i ca n't blame people who get the idea that germany wants them to come . 
  i have a cunning plan , since every tom dick and harry wants to come to europe , let 's take europe to them . 
  it would be the reconqista on steroids , portuguese empire mk2 . 
  they have given the migrants that impression and that is all that matters . 
  good for what ? 
  as in we have enough or we want more ? 
   dehuminzation is the furthest step hate can take . 
  sort of like how certain people like to dismiss those who are worried about mass immigration as nazis ? 
  they are perfectly welcome to seek a better life , just not at the expense of the european people . 
  god this guy again , / pol / seems to like him for some reason . 
  refugees running from the cop 's , camera woman help 's slow the down . 
  i 'd rather that than a real honest to goodness give until i have nothing left fanatic . 
  do n't forget headlines like `` refugees forced onto train 's '' .

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wt8zvuwhwa like this ? 
   you seem to completely lack self-awareness and if you have no desire to explore other viewpoints or consider that your own may be flawed then we have nothing more to talk about . 
  i am curious as to why you people always like to resort to personal insults as a first response when encountering dissenting opinions ? 
   salafism in germany tends to attract complete losers who dream of being important . 
  they are just embracing the `` change '' that germany must undergo . 
  they should just shut up and accept the enrichment yes ? 
  thanks mama merkel . 
   ever consider that maybe you 're in the wrong ? 
  nope . 
   so in what way are you more of an expert than the german vice chancellor ? 
  what credentials do you have ? 
  judging by the stupidity the vice chancellor is saying i 'd rather have a chimpanzee in charge . 
   `` nearly a century '' , because assad is certainly not been that long in power . 
  so his dad was n't a dictator ? 
   syria has been a ** secular coutnry ** for nearly a century , they have nightclubs , bars , ** hijabs and niqabs are banned at universities ** , plenty of women wear short clothing . 
  all done under your friendly neighbourhood dictator . 
   it 's also a bit dumb how people are prematurely assuming new arrivals wo n't integrate . 
  gypsies man , how long have they been in europe , still not integrated . 
  what do you people have against violins ? 
  it really is . 
   over 90 % of the population it does n't seem to matter what the population thinks these days . 
  at least it 's not sweden where a brutal rapist gets community service . 
  at least i 'm not taking pictures of their corpses . 
  actually the yank 's have the largest oil reserves , they are just using other people 's oil first . 
  i think he means that people will turn to the one 's offering a solution , if the mainstream of politics is unable or unwilling to lead , then expect the fringe to become more popular . 
  or they can see how much it has changed europe for the worst and want no part in it . 
   while the normal refugees are `` busy raping those young girls in england can provide you with first hand accounts if you doubt this , as can a few swedish women . 
  looks like they tried it with the riot van , but that shit is weak sauce when compared to the tractor . 
   you are entitled to a free house if your country has a war !, 
  do n't give people ideas . 
   empty accusations and vague appeals to emotions . 
  pretty typical of leftwing political dialogue . 
  is it a happening place ? 
  as propaganda i would give it a 4/10 . 
  what is / pol / ? 
  they sure do look like some underfed terrified refugees to me , what third world country was this video filmed in ? 
  it stand 's to reason that the more refugees that come the greater the costs will be . 
  i am not the one doing the proclamations , senior government figures are . 
   those 200k will bring another 200k of their family members still not a realistic number , an extra 400 or maybe even 600 thousand people would be more realistic . 
   re used to spending a lot more on crises than a couple billion a year . 
  except that this is the new normal . 
  so they are estimating 600 thousand actual refugees and for these people to only bring in 200 thousand more , seems like an extremely conservative number.if you assume that each will person only has two family members , that is still 1.2 million people , if you use a more realistic number of 4 family members that number is 2.4 million people . 
   `` if we forget this , we forget who we are , and we leave europe to the xenophobes , the extremists , who will destroy it , '' unfortunately it appears that pathological altruist 's will beat them to it . 
  why are the police involved in evictions ? 
  bbc : `` those vikings such great guys , they really brought some excitement to britain '' . 
   and he is using facts to back that up . 
  what facts ? 
   `` the erroneous part is that of the people on earth who are able to fly on holiday -- who live at this economic level -- about ** half live outside the western world ** . 
  ** the difference is not that big . 
  ** so half of the tourists come from a population of just under a billion , the other half comes from six billion , i would say that is quite a big difference actually . 
   europe does n't have citizenship by birth . 
  technically the kids get the citizenship of the parents , and not the host nation . 
  do you see your friendly leftwing party letting this intolerable situation stand for very long ? 
  i wonder if there has been pressure to change this ? 
  in any case we have a real world example of the turkish guest workers who are still in germany and do n't look to be returning any time soon . 
  left handers are the next step in the evolution of man fyi . 
   the premise that they are n't going back is flawed and not necessarily true . 
  people suspected for warcrimes are not being sent back , and lets not forget the children they have whilst in europe , are they not now citizens of the country they are born in ? 
  i think you are being overly optimistic in you assumptions that there is a united will to send these people back when whatever conflict is over , and as for bare minimums to survive , i can hear the lawyers cackling in the wings just waiting for the opportunity to pounce . 
   why go to the trouble of integrating them if the whole point is simply for them to have somewhere safe to be until the conflict is over ? 
  because they are never ever ever going back . 
  sweden : `` fuck germoney is out to take our title of humanitarian superpower '', 
  they have a severe case of nazi guilt and white guilt , a fatal combination in my opinion . 
  shifting gears , how barbaric . 
  left . 
  i thought it was funny that the original terminus for the tunnel was waterloo . 
  since coming to australia 15 years ago the government of western australia has tried 2 or 3 times to have a referendum on daylight savings , which is annoying as fuck because voting is compulsory here . 
   i do n't think it will last for 10 years . 
  africa is set to triple it 's population to about 4 billion in 2050 , factor this in and the coming problems from climate change and you will see that there will never be and end to this in your and possibly your children 's lifetimes . 
   either way , you should stop commenting . 
  the news outlets of europe are not much better , what with them fabricating stories of hungarian police beating migrants . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecc2_gz_moq ca n't beat this one tho . 
  free speech , some of us still have it . 
  well if you do n't want to be swamped by refugees you probably should n't encourage them , it was quite irresponsible of her to say what she said and now turn around and demand to spread them around europe . 
  in what way is there a difference between criminal activity and murder ? 
  : ddddd, 
   we also wo n't send back syrians to the first dublin-iii country , that they arrived in . 
  not because we want more syrians . 
  you should probably tell frau merkel to consider her words more carefully next time . 
   there 's a difference between ** criminal activity ** and ** murder ** til murder is not a crime , you should probably get someone to proofread what you type before clicking that save button . 
  it still had sharia which is an integral part of the religion . 
  and the secular identity is remarkably similar to christianity just without the god part 's . 
   making a concentrated effort to provide suitable accommodation and treat them like human beings , did n't you see the video of the `` refugees '' complaining about having to sleep in tent 's , i believe one of them used the words `` do you think we are animals ? 
  american billions : how the usa fund 's ngo 's in eastern europe .
