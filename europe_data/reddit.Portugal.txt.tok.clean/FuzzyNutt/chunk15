   relatively small problems ( compared to war ) like the refugee it remains to be seen whether europe will survive the consequences of the current demographics shift 's . 
  this is sort of like how russia views nato/eu expansion eastwards as a threat , and the nato/eu views their expansion as containing russian aggression . 
   the bad thing is mixing foreign languages into your own mother tongue , sodomizing it in the process . 
  that 's how we got english in the first place . 
  some leprechaun blood in that one . 
  all part of the whyatt mann 's plan to keep the black man down . 
  it 's like the afrocentrist 's who claim that [ black people where rulers in historical europe ] ( http://www.realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/misc/crests/crests_3.htm ) . 
  we must inhabit different universes if you think that the `` west '' has been in love with russia . 
  the only reason that they are in greece is the certainty that they will be able to move on into europe and get asylum in other european countries , remove this certainty and you will go a long way to stopping the flow . 
  `` assad tortured me and burned my fingerprints off . '', 
   i call bs on that . 
  ** our morals are based on our morals ** and ** innate empathy . 
  ** your morals are shaped by your culture and culture is shaped by religion and vice versa . 
  the less said about humanities innate empathy the better . 
  `` they have given us a problem with no solution . '', 
  sums up where we are at perfectly . 
  here in australia there was just a hundred word snippet in the one paper i looked at . 
  i nominate malmo syndrome as the name for this disorder . 
  i know , i was just being funny . 
  why does your pet own a cat ? 
  nope , their gardens used to be in what is called the `` brown lands '' , they got wasted by morgoth . 
  dead . 
   but unlike the usa , ** there are n't enough minorities and middle-class urban liberals for this to be a realistic electoral strategy . 
  ** yet . 
  whales has a dragon , have you ever seen a real dragon ? 
  probably by talking to the police ? 
  he is employed in security so he must regularly come into contact with the police who operate in his area . 
   sigh ... it 's gon na take a few more rapes before public opinion changes . 
  you think so ? 
  the brits have thousands of confirmed rapes and they have n't changed their minds . 
   its that the hate groups ( which didnt give a shit about such stuff before ) now make a mess of this and spout their usual crap i seem to remember these `` hate groups '' saying that stuff like this would happen and them being called racist fearmongers because of this . 
   not even bough in for questioning ( 120 complains , 3 suspects , no arrests at one week after the events , i find it strange that there were no arrests because there is a video by a bouncer and in it he claims that all the nearby jails were full and that the police released people who then came back and started harassing the police . 
   it seems like a large sector of german generations have been unable to conceive of german culture , language , history , and customs to be something worth protecting and promoting through policy . 
  that is by [ design ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rg1lwg4dxs ) . 
  yup it is amazing how quickly the much vaunted `` european values '' are tossed away . 
  it is actually very common . 
   the uk gives more in international aid than any other developed country ** apart from the united states ** , according to figures from the organisation for economic co-operation and development . 
  you were saying ? 
   the question is , how do we tackle this issue of cultural/social integration ? 
  i do n't think it is possible . 
  is n't a loophole an unintended use of the law ? 
   sure , but you became part of a liberal democracy , and were expected to remain one . 
  do n't like that ? 
  go through the secession process . 
  is this the same eu that wants ukraine and turkey to join ? 
  would n't it be slave coming from slav ? 
   why , is somebody forcing you to have interracial sex ? 
  sarkozy seems to have an [ interracial fetish ] ( https://twitter.com/nicolassarkozy/status/517743553515360256 ) . 
  it 's like a competition between you two to see who can get the most negative articles on the front page . 
   unlike some cranky subs ... take away their potatoes . 
  he also walked away from a plane crash . 
   the unconstitutionality of the previous parliament 's actions do not excuse the actions of the current government . 
  he is asking you where all the protests where when the pro eu government was doing it , why is the eu protesting this government over their silence when it was done by their allies ? 
   good thing i 've never heard the `` without eu , there 's no peace '' anywhere but from anti eu . 
  you are in a comment chain in which the op said exactly this . 
  ahh the beautiful english rose , how did it come to this britishers ? 
  it 's in the name '' ** mutually ** assured destruction '' , once one side feels that the destruction will be in their favour or not then we will see another arms race . 
   russia 's invasions of its neighbour . 
  happened because the unofficial agreements where nullified . 
  nato expands because it wants to . 
   its assured mutual destruction . 
  americas moves towards missile defences is a move that will destabilise the balance of power in this regard . 
   yes , but honestly , russian government actions makes it so easy target for such jokes . 
  its no wonder that you would come to such a conclusion  everything `` angers '' moscow ** as long as authors of such articles are willing to interpret every action of russia as a result of anger . 
   first of all poland , unlike countries like hungary or slovenia , is not a transit country for the refugees there is the germans redistribution plan . 
   the most popular petition has 400 votes of 25000 required . 
  not so much it seems . 
   it 's still ( for now ) thoroughly corrupt and has very little to offer . 
  except for some of the best farmland in the world , a highly educated populace , another nato satellite near russia and denying russia a key naval base . 
   during the lowest demand period ( 2:15 am ) and during a storm . 
  figures that they would have to make this up . 
   ** nothing unusual except for armed forces at busy streets , government and public buildings . 
  ** it is amazing how quickly these things became the norm . 
  there are plans to redistribute refugees across the eu , maybe that has something to do with the concern . 
  it 's not only them , and the number the op is quoting ( 79 % ) is the number who think immigration is the ** eu 's ** biggest problem , the second graph shows that in estonia it 's self 45 % are concerned about immigration . 
  would you rather that they have the problems that france is having before they can express concern ? 
  probably people who have at least ten generations descended from european ancestors , i think that would be a minimum for someone to be culturally european . 
  only potato . 
  gooby pls , [ dolan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvaqsnnp64 ) is the best . 
  i think that ian smith is still alive or at the very least recently deceased . 
  unfortunately the very act of defining the `` us '' is forbidden to us unless it cast 's such a wide net so as to be meaningless in the end . 
  the current reality is the attempt to accommodate non-europeans and as the video states the only way to do this is to reduce your already established identity into one of just being nice to people ( who does n't think they are nice ? 
  the finn 's did it , why ca n't you . 
  if russian nuclear weapons was enough to have america almost start a world war then it would be even more of a threat today . 
  christianity without god basically . 
  i recently watched [ this ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehghwfd4sm ) video , i think that it has a good explanation for your questions . 
  tldr : europe in its desire to be accommodating too non european 's has had to water down what a european is , the same process is going on in the individual states to varying degrees . 
  the us has actually invaded cuba . 
  finna fail . 
  hue hue hue . 
  even better after reading your post . 
  they did almost start world war three over cuba . 
  dixie chick 's . 
  obama 's views change based on what 's popular with the electorate . 
  when common sense is hate speech what does that say about the level of discourse in your country ? 
   according to the united nations , nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and has one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world . 
  by their projections , nigeria is one of eight countries expected to account collectively for half of the world 's total population increase from 2005 -- 2050 . 
  [ 140 ] by 2100 the un estimates that the nigerian population will be between 505 million and 1.03 billion people ( middle estimate : 730 million ) . 
  [ 141 ] ** in 1950 , nigeria had only 33 million people ** . 
  where are you going in such a hurry traveler ?
