  stop ... do not proceed ; you have no greater concern , than this one : that on which you focus your sight . 
  recall how many have passed from this world , reflect on your similar end , there is good reason to reflect if only all did the same . 
  ponder , you so influenced by fate , among the many concerns of the world , so little do you reflect on death ; if by chance you glance at this place , stop ... for the sake of your journey , the more you pause , the further on your journey you will be . 
   not denying that russia is surrounded . 
   the notion that any entity would be able to surround russia is ludicrous . 
  really . 
  you will need a lot then . 
  they may live in multicultural countries but they do n't practice state level [ multiculturalism the way we do ] ( https://youtu.be/qxet7jk-hhg?t=8m23s ) . 
   is france a barbaric country where vigilante justice is the way to go ? 
  what makes you think that france or any european country is incapable of descending into this letter kind of violence ? 
  this event and the one in australia is just an inevitable occurrence when you live in a multicultural society , on the one hand it 's the good food on the other it 's the occasional terrorist attack or riots . 
  it seems that the frequency increases when a certain type of migrant is involved . 
   anyway , how does this article pertain to europe ? 
  if australia can get into eurovision then israel can get into r/europe .

  get the others to vote next time . 
   no , i have no stake in this discussion and care little about the parties . 
  for someone with no stake you seem pretty involved in this thread .

  anyone interested in gang lore should google the number 's gang from south africa . 
  segregation was n't that long ago . 
  the american democrats where the party of slavery and segregation , would you say that they have n't changed ? 
  i was responding to someone mentioning the uk . 
  and all those mulahs who want gays to be killed are let in to talk in the universities , it 's not a matter of extremist opinions but a matter of silencing the ones that `` we '' do n't like . 
  i live in australia so i would n't know about that , but i was just referring to the atheist crowd on reddit who always make the claim of there being no war on christmas whilst themselves engaging in it . 
   bacalhau , a portuguese dish using norwegian dried fish . 
  good stuff sven . 
  pierogi is good i hear . 
  there is no war against christmas ( even though we go out of our way to rename or de-christianise the holiday ) . 
   people who hold extremist opinions or are otherwise deemed undesirable get denied entry to western european countries all the time . 
  haha really ?

  gibe back constantinople !!, 
  not really , that is the passenger who goes through the window , the driver lives . 
   the mortar statement is ridiculous ok , but did n't they find an rpg in the recent raids after paris , or was that in belgium ? 
  is it lies or was trump right ? 
  lot 's of butthurt by that innocent little comment , maybe i should google the guy . 
  i think it is all the freedom that does it . 
  maybe for you , but i have never heard of him before . 
   and have you seen what happened on the right when obama was elected ? 
  well america as always is a special place full of special people . 
  first time i hear of him , i was just making a general comment on the reactions i have noticed when a conservative/right wing government wins . 
  first the french guy warning about a possible civil war if fn wins , then the big march in polan and then this guy also warning of a civil war . 
  the article just mentions that he is against the new conservative government , forgive me for not knowing what side of the political spectrum some random pole is on . 
  need 's more onions tbh . 
  what is it with the left acting like the world has ended when they lose power to the right ? 
  http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sweden-yes something along those lines , usually found in alt right/nrx board 's / forums . 
  [ lol , here is what peutin thinks of that statement ] ( https://youtu.be/8ux3oiweliq ), 
  meme magic is real , next you will find that trump is the next president of murica . 
  a nation is not a set of laws or lines on a map . 
  do n't know why you are being downvoted for stating the truth . 
  not what you say but how and to whom . 
   there are much better ways to effectively change behavior than corporal punishment . 
  name a few . 
  that 's what the police in zimbabwe do when they are torturing people , they also like to use a telephone book and hit the body through that as it 's less likely to leave bruises that way . 
  hand 's up guys , how many of you walk around with globs of semen on your hands after sex ? 
   pity it took me so long to realize . 
  tell us your story . 
   by doing this eu is basically forcing border countries to deal with immigrants on their own . 
  yep they are turning both greece and italy into giant camps for migrants . 
  i think he also does not mean it in a legal sense . 
   arabs and probably armenian . 
  does not compute . 
  depends what they feed the pigs , a truck used to pick up ice cream for the pigs at this place i used to work at . 
  their own country wo n't take them back as a majority of the gdp is due to expats sending money home . 
  the government owned some flats/houses and told the current tenants that they need them so please move out . 
  polan can not into whiteness it seems , also polish men in their 40 's are just as violent as those in their 20 `` s it seems, 
  guy on the front left is using mobile phone . 
   and making super-original and funny nazi jokes ... 
  someone make nigel stop . 
  it is done so on purpose because the vast majority of people never read an entire article , at most they will read the first paragraph . 
   peace is so horrible right , and it has been 70 years already since the last proper war . 
  i think the people in charge are thinking this . 
  nyet , you would hurt someone trying to steal or rape you , we cant allow this type of behaviour . 
  1400 is just in rotherham , there are more cases in other cities in the uk . 
   he is right . 
  also the cost should be carried by all of the eu and not just greece . 
   we have an interest in secure borders especially towards the middle east and north africa . 
  if they are not going to turn anyone back they should just give up the pretence of being a ** border ** protection force and just start a ferry service into europe . 
  you could have been relevant by staying in the russian federation too . 
  joining the eu means giving up on some independence , and since the eu is all about `` ever closer union '' it means that you will eventually lose all aspects of independence . 
  and yet here we are and the same peoples who regained their independence ca n't wait to give it up again . 
   ** anglo ** phile trying to blame everything on non-anglo countries . 
  huh ? 
  do you know history by any chance ? 
   so that the rest of the eu member states do n't feel left out , european commission president jean-claude juncker will also take a seat at the negotiating table . 
  rest of eu how reassured are you with this man representing you ? 
   i 'll leave the `` bears no relation to the teaching of the prophet mohammed '' portion to others ... but red ken is dead on about the rest of it . 
  just wait until labor gets back in m8 . 
  so you mean that this concerted russia bashing has nothing to do with politics ?
