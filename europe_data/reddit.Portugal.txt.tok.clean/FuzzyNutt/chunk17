  the `` progressive '' side of the party is so far left that it 's hard to differentiate between them and the far right . 
   a survey carried out by the european union last year estimated that 13 million woman in europe experienced physical violence in 2013 . 
   ** but statistics and surveys suggest the problem is less prevalent in spain than other european countries , our correspondent says . 
  ** but still you have to pander to the largest voter base .

  it could be that for the more educated person he gets to eat at all these diverse restaurants and hire cheap labour whereas the less educated person is directly competing with the immigrant . 
  the one in the middle is really shocked by what they are doing . 
  i did n't say it was a good idea , i just pointed out what the mindset of those advocating it is .
