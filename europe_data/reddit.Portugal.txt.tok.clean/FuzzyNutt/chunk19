  [ enjoy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkne__timzo ) . 
  at this point all we can do is sit back and enjoy the ride . 
  like what ? 
  hue hue hue . 
  judging by the moralising mutti is doing at the moment i 'm sure she expects a christmas miracle . 
   [ mutti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muti ) :d, 
   britain is already estranged from the eu core by its currency . 
   then we dodged the single currency . 
  i get the impression that this guy wants britain to join the euro . 
  not enough diversity in the picture , i see too many german 's thanking germany . 
  in practice it amounts to the same thing , in order for the cultures of the minority to be acknowledged , the culture of the majority needs to be pushed back , for diversity of course . 
  they are doing just this , they just are n't as blunt about it as the swede 's . 
  usually what they say are things like '' multiculturalism is inevitable '' . 
  black flag and bearded men , i can understand how you can get the idea that they are isis . 
  post some positive news then . 
  hey i never claimed to be an expert at grammar . 
  i think that for a few country 's ( sweden , france ) it has gone to the point where irregardless of any further migration there is enough foreigners to eventually replace the natives albeit at a slower pace . 
  i 'm pretty sure that we are at `` you ca n't stop it '' levels of happening . 
  interesting that the total of those fleeing for reasons other than assad is larger than those fleeing assad . 
   we 've got to stay in the eu !, 
  we must continue to make france suffer this would convince many to stay . 
  judging by the news not much is happening in yemen . 
   like you say everything they 've done recently has been neatly countered by the us / eu . 
  i think it 's because people have this conception that eu / us governance is incompetent . 
   firstly russia is the one reacting to eu/us moves , and judging by the body count and wrecked countries that are left in the wake of western governments foreign policy , calling them incompetent is being very kind . 
  the people in charge seem to think they can sell us that fantasy . 
  please tell me that euroenglish is n't an actual thing , please !, 
   british and american english one of these came before the other , just because the americans were to lazy to teach kids how to spell correctly does not mean that the rest of the world has to follow their bad example . 
  when you are on the side of justice why let a little thing like state sovereignty get in the way . 
   color is perfectly rite as wel , but then again you probably have been taut by british only tunel visionary school , so i will just hate you slightly . 
  :p fixed for you :p, 
   im british , i have a u in ` colour ' even though it is n't pronounced ''  :( door pronounced as dor lets just get rid of the extra o , i mean it wuld look like a 3 year old was riting it but who cares rite ? 
  a truly pitiful country , you have my condolences m8 . 
  colour , remember the u please , not everyone is illiterate amerikanski . 
  because they were the ones who approached , this indicates that they are the ones who went seeking a confrontation . 
   despite the effort that the municipality has done to keep the demonstrations apart is a large procession pegida opponents approached the closed meeting . 
  people carrying banners with slogans saying `` pegida cowards '' and `` pegida fascists '' . 
  does n't seem like a peaceful counter demonstration . 
   unfortunately , some anti-pegida groups disagreed with that notion and went to the pegida demonstration , resulting in clashes , and the police needing to disperse both groups . 
  just from what i could understand of the translation it gives the impression that the pegida were the ones doing the violence . 
  i know that this is a fairly typical thing to do in anglo news when ever there is a `` far-right '' demonstration that gets attacked , the victims are always painted as the aggressors . 
   it is a really disappointing thing , and shameful for anyone daing to call themselves a magic practitioner . 
  ** if you cared , you would 've said something . 
  ** that 's what i was focused on , not the magic practitioner bit . 
  because just like merkel said `` who are we to judge , we who have enslaved people '' . 
  that 's the logic at play , i do n't agree with it but it is what it is . 
   it is a really disappointing thing , and shameful for anyone daing to call themselves a magic practitioner . 
  if you cared , you would 've said something . 
  what , and risk being called racist !, 
  god but hollande has a punchable face . 
  no idea , but they are selective in which religions they criticize . 
  i 'd say that there are quite a few who are atheists just because they dislike christianity . 
  european 's are doomed going by the amount of apologia contaminated in this thread . 
  destruction of the nation state and the creation of a federal europe . 
  those little engerlanders , they seem to be regressing lately . 
  well spotted . 
  the nation state is not a concept but a reality . 
   right wing extremist , uses the american flag after committing a crime , does it make the american flag a criminal symbol ? 
  this literally happened not to long ago it even went so far as people wanting to dig up graves of people hundreds of years dead . 
  he should have added for the most part at the end there . 
  if anyone had told you 10 or 20 years ago that a man is a woman so long as he feels he is one you would probably have been doubtful as well . 
  which is ironic considering one of the people denying the romanians in is also welcoming masses of migrants at the same time . 
  it 's not like they were going to get in anyway . 
   ** maintain ** influence in the middle east . 
  somehow leverage it into ** keeping ** ukraine under his fold . 
  would n't be surprised if his longterm goals included the baltics as well . 
  limit the us ' influence and establish a competing block . 
  all this ukraine , middle east etc stuff is a geopolitical game from both sides . 
  [ probably this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-khcnk9byy4 ) , he 's not exactly shy about telling people why he is doing what he is doing . 
  imagine when they expand child abuse to include being in a home whose parents are against mass immigration/refugees , fun times ahead . 
   do n't you think they 've earned a right to citizenship ? 
  citizenship should be viewed as a privilege not a right , and besides that it is up to the people in any given country to decide who they want to allow to become a citizen . 
  i saw that , but do femen get much support from mainstream media and feminist circles ? 
   syria is and has been a russian satellite for almost half a decade . 
   russia just lost most of ukraine for , well , ever . 
  it never fails to amaze me how such acts of aggression towards russia are widely viewed as being reactions to russian aggression , i mean i can understand the central/eastern europeans wanting into the eu/nato but surely someone in charge in western europe should have at least anticipated the response they go in regards to ukraine . 
   how are we all going to make sure we find a way to not have them languishing in refugee camps for years upon years ? 
  seeing as how the vast majority of them will remain in camps the most optimal use of resources is to try and make the camps as bearable as possible . 
  the only real beneficiary 's of the current policy are the certain groups of the western public and the political class who get to show the world how tolerant and magnanimous they are , in the fore front of their minds is `` what will people think of us '' and not `` what is the best way to help '' . 
   germany desperately needs migrants to fill a growing skills shortage in the workplace there are a few eu members with no schengen access that could probably fix that . 
   islamic conference on when it is acceptable to beat your wife . 
  wonder where all the brave fighters against the [ patriarchy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1v5pi0e954 ) were at ? 
  also gays and jews . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/farnese_hercules ) he just put a blue ball on the solder and called it done . 
  its just a blue ball , nothing to get excited about . 
   the statue features a naked man in greco-roman style balancing a blue mirrored sphere on his shoulder . 
  is n't that the statue of hercules ? 
  looks like shit , no harmony whatsoever . 
   actual evidence to back up the claim that things were `` made worse '' after the statement ? 
  video of thousands of people marching towards germany maybe ? 
  he will probably still be saying that when his face is melting off . 
  probably means sharia courts which are present in most european countries . 
   for years we 've been blocked from accessing the labour market in half of the western countries even though we were a eu member which i find quite odd seeing as how the pro immigration side always talks about these people filling up the job vacancy 's . 
   we simply ca n't stop the influx of refugees , since there is no effective way to control the borders anymore . 
  i have n't heard a single valueable argument by the ` concerned citizens ' about this fact . 
   saying `` we need to stop the influx !!,
