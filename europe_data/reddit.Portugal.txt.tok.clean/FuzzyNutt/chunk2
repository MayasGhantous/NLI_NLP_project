   it is not the case that foreigners sponge off the state , since statistics show that , overall , non-germans are net contributors through the taxes they pay . 
  it is not the case that foreigners take the jobs of native germans , as evidence shows they fill significant gaps at both ends of the labor market . 
  why conflate migrants with skilled workers from europe ? 
   tanzania 61.4 percent of respondents to be christian , 35.2 percent to be muslim  liberia 85.5 % of liberia 's population practices christianity . 
  [ 2 ] muslims comprise 12.2 % of the population , islam has had a much longer presence in central africa than christianity . 
   very strict regulations in place when it comes to migration into europe . 
  that is for legal migration , the current crisis has shown that the measures for illegal immigration get thrown out the window when the system is stressed . 
  well you do have a tendency to invade more countries than the russians . 
   that is until they kill a few europeans . 
  that would be the response of rational human beings , quite a few europeans seem to be anything but rational . 
  if the people and the government both want to see themselves replaced who can object , however once these people started to decide that the rest of europe must follow them to the dustbin of history then there is a problem . 
  people on your side of the argument generally tend to use thinly veil 'd accusations of racism , and they also do n't seem to think that there is any argument that can be made ( in good faith ) against the current system . 
   not everyone has good taste . 
  not everyone has good taste . 
   and you know what processed meat is . 
  does anyone ? 
  no portus cale . 
  you forgot the french in the the thread title . 
   musicians are n't likely to get rich from selling records today , unlike their 20th century predecessors this can only be a good thing considering the massive amounts of shit being churned out by the music industry . 
  queueing and shit all over the place , such heavy drinkers too . 
  that opinion is the view that the mainstream of the media , politics and academia is pushing . 
  `` this is going to happen . '', 
  `` diversity is inevitable and desirable . '', 
   - meet their obligations of international responsibility-sharing , to ** resettle significant numbers of refugees ** and provide aid to countries hosting large numbers of refugee if upholding these laws and rights will result in damage to the ethnic people of europe then just like we created these laws and concepts we can undo them as well . 
  the elites of europe seem hell bent on betraying the people through this population replacement scheme . 
  in australia myself , but if you did happen to have some lying around i totally would n't mind escaping the oven . 
  what are the shoulder pads for ? 
   i guess a little black dress that is 3 sizes to small being worn by an overweight woman , in the height of winter ... that 'd be our traditional dress nowadays . 
  how the mighty have fallen . 
  [ perfect camp ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/magazine/how-to-build-a-perfect-refugee-camp.html ) [ portuguese accomodation ] ( http://www.jn.pt/multimedia/galeria.aspx?content_id=4770882 ), 
  really you consider that inhumane ? 
  give me some brunettes and ill be right over . 
   why would you think that diversity necessarily leads to violence ? 
  probably because there are lots of historical and present day examples of violence being used against minority 's in places with economic and political instability . 
   no i disagree with you that diversity will only increase with ** abundant wealth ** and ** world peace . 
  ** two things that are not going to last forever , diversity will just make the situation more violent when it does arise . 
   homogeneity is not a requirement for a stable country . 
  diversity is not a requirement for a stable country . 
   so are we still waiting for the french to have a war to kick the spanish out after the spanish civil war ? 
  or the irish out of australia , argentina , usa ? 
  or the vietnamese in france , germany , australia ? 
  or how about the swiss ? 
  how long has that country been stable and inhomogeneous ? 
  or the germans in poland ... oh wait . 
  so you agree with me that homogenisation is the norm . 
   wars in general always cause displacement of people that will result in diversification somewhere else . 
  until that somewhere else has a war and they inturn use it to homogenise themselves . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/why-the-survey-of-british-muslim-attitudes-is-so-profoundly-disconcerting-10070358.html http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-19/tighter-australian-immigration-policies-needed-islamic-council/6479942 http://www.thelocal.de/20120301/41079 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm, 
  the economy just needs to tank that 's all . 
   it 's eugenics , a relic of history . 
  with the advances being made in biology designer babies will be a thing very soon , so you might not have a breeding program per se but you will have eugenics going on . 
   homogenous and segregated societies are a thing of the past and will continue to decline . 
  the very recent past also disproves this , many countries used the chaos in the aftermath of ww2 to remove unwanted groups from amongst them . 
  the only way you can have an ever increasing diversification is if there is no war , no economic catastrophe or political upheavals , basically you would need a constant over abundance of resources which is not in any way shape or form a realistic view of the future . 
  god damn !, 
  so the `` western '' propaganda machine is attempting to pro-actively discredit people who do n't follow the established narrative vis a vis russia . 
  if you have access to dynamite and are tying to enter a county illegally i think we can safely call that an invading army about then . 
   wikipedia calls it a `` philosophy '' , which is about as polite a dismissal as i can imagine . 
  wikipedia is not exactly a site without bias , you might as-well call darwin 's theory on evolution a `` philosophy '' because eugenics is using that and applying it to humans . 
   ** `` any society , anywhere in the world , will be diverse in the future -- that 's the future of the world , '' ** timmermans said . 
  `` so [ central european countries ] will have to get used to that . 
  they need political leaders who have the courage to explain that to their population instead of playing into the fears as i 've seen mr orb\u00e1n doing in the last couple of months . '' so the trend to homogeneity for the entirety of human history is going to just stop and we are all going to hold hands and get all warm and fuzzy together . 
  someone save us from those with utopian visions . 
   we certainly have more experience with diversity than western europe , which had almost no culturally diverse minorities mere few decades ago , before the mass immigration influx began . 
  the pace of the change has been quite alarming . 
   central european countries have `` no experience with diversity , '' this statement would be factual if your idea of `` diverse '' is anyone not white . 
  to me europe seems pretty diverse with multiple languages and cultures , but i suppose that for your diversity to count you cant be white . 
   pseudo-science . 
  europe has hate speech laws that are generally not enforced in regards to islamic preachers whereas in america if the public is made aware of this they would object to it , so they are not as tolerant of this type of behaviour . 
   this seems to be a european issue - as an immigrant to the us people from every corner are all-american burger loving football watching patriots by generation 2 . 
  america still has issues with terrorists but i 'd say the major difference is that america gets to choose who comes and they are also not as tolerant of hate preachers . 
  better the snake you know than the cockroach you do n't know . 
   yeltsin he vowed to transform russia 's socialist economy into a capitalist market economy and implemented economic shock therapy , price liberalization and nationwide privatization . 
  due to the sudden total economic shift , a majority of the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs . 
  [ 3 ] the well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons . 
  rather than creating new enterprises , yeltsin 's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former soviet markets , arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market . 
  [ 4 ] much of the yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption , and as a result of persistent low oil and commodity prices during the 1990s , russia suffered inflation , economic collapse and enormous political and social problems that affected russia and the other former states of the ussr . 
  within a few years of his presidency , many of yeltsin 's initial supporters had started to criticize his leadership , and vice president alexander rutskoy even denounced the reforms as `` economic genocide '' . 
  so just disregard the [ bbc ] ( https://youtu.be/lero9lp201q?t=3m44s ) , the most influential broadcaster in britain . 
  so a university setup with a far left agenda is pushing a right wing agenda ? 
   many will become less religous when actually given a choice the actual observable facts say that this is not the case , the second and third generations have taken to identifying with islam instead of adopting the country that they are in . 
  wishful thinking on your part . 
   `` the united states , or australia and new zealand , are migrant societies and therefore they accommodate more readily those from other backgrounds than we do ourselves , ** who still nurse a sense of our homogeneity and difference from others ** . 
  and that 's precisely what ** the european union , in my view , should be doing its best to undermine . 
  i think he should get a ban for such a low effort shitpost . 
   there are clear economic and social benefits to those countries receiving migrants . 
  lies  in the absence of such a body , we need to give sir peter sutherland , the un secretary-general 's special representative for migration and development , the mandate and wherewithal to catalyse action . 
  yes yes lets give peter [ ` undermine national homogeneity ' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 ) sutherland the means to put his ideas into action . 
  trying to appeal to authority really ? 
  the fact that this idiot is a person with influence is quite worrying . 
  well a british poster said exactly the same thing in this thread . 
  sounds rough . 
  but how can we achieve moral super power status without them . 
  so 21 country 's decided to impose their will on 4 country 's . 
  hitler = negative , negative of a negative = positive . 
  september has been a good month , one week left what more can go wrong . 
   i can not imagine how this crisis could 've been more badly managed . 
  ask greece to relinquish control of its borders ... oh they did that . 
   i think we should concentrate on fighting against a permanent quota system that would ** take the sovereignity from us . 
  ** it has already been taken .
