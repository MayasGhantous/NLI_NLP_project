   these refugees will come if people like it or not .

   europe consists of sovereign states . 
  something something you sighned treaty takes the euromoneys ... timne to bay debnts now !,

  in the 94 it was 74 % in favour of greater autonomy , in 91 they voted 94 % in favour of becoming an autonomous state as a subject of the then ussr . 
  how can you say that when a foreign power already has numerous military bases in europe ? 
  face it , europe is a vassal of the american empire . 
  what about all the other referendum before the current one ? 
  did you or did you not have mccain on the ground glad handing with the maidan crew ? 
  why was victoria nuland mingling with the crowd during maidan ? 
  it 's a fact that america was heavily involved in the removal of a democratically elected president and that they spent billions inthe years preceding this in trying to underminethe the pro russian politicians . 
   by whom ? 
  anyone with a brain . 
  did someone say [ quasi religion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkk7xsj-xm ) ? 
   i could n't quickly find statistics for other african nationalities , so if anyone finds them i would appreciate it . 
  so far , this just sounds like someone not understanding basic statistics . 
  or deliberately misconstruing them . 
   the deal will result in the government providing up to # 8bn of financing to ge 's supply chain , potentially creating up to 1,000 jobs . 
  i 'm beginning to think that the people in charge of socket standards are major trolls . 
  by accident . 
   one german state is now trying to seperate refugees by home country but do n't want to seperate them by religion as refugees have to understand that germany has freedom of religion . 
  i 'm sure that the christians appreciate being used to teach tolerance to the muslims .

  ** i have no idea what he posted . 
   the image of the rare historic warplane is not `` nazi imagery '' . 
  i know that i was just referring to the clubs reason for firing him . 
  if the club is so worried about welcoming the newcomers then nazi imagery is the right way to go about this , outside of europe most people are ambivalent to hitler if not outright fans of his . 
  has n't it just come out that america has spent five hundred million training people who end up defecting to america 's supposed enemy ? 
  that 's not really a very good analogy . 
  they are under the assumption that these migrant 's will join the workforce fairly soon , as for the divisions in society , that is something that they see a benefit . 
  there is hope for the rest of us \\ o / . 
  the problem is that the current system rewards immoral behaviour . 
  let them in until we are replaced . 
   spanish callos i think it 's the smell when its being cooked , but after that it 's quite nice . 
  omg at 8:40 , `` i have to say what the fuck is wrong with those swedes '' . 
  i was referring to the guy who attacked the senior minister . 
  first time i hear of this and i read a lot of news . 
   is it also a euphemism for `` multiracial '' ? 
  because the former sense seems pretty inapplicable to his argument . 
  same thing with `` diversity '' . 
  for what ? 
   i am not sure why some people keep on pretending that there is no issue . 
  so they do n't have to confront the reality of what their ideology has allowed to happen . 
   [ dont trust r/europe on sweden .

   where should i migrate to ? 
  nope , probably antarctica is the best option . 
   a minority like `` women '' women actually make up more than half the population of any given country that is n't selectively aborting females in favour of males . 
  women are also more likely in favour of immigration . 
   we are still not out of the cold war . 
  that 's fairly obvious today .

   russia is not ussr stop quibbling , when people want to bash russia they are quick to point out that putin was a kgb agent . 
  i have shown that the west did in fact give russia reassurances that there would be no nato expansion eastwards , that is all that matters . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html this one, 
   russian president dmitry medvedev has accused the west of breaking promises made after the fall of the iron curtain , saying that nato 's expansion into eastern europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over german reunification . 
  newly discovered documents from western archives support the russian position .

   seems to work with a google search of the url but not 8chan as a term . 
  although afaik google has always blocked child abuse content . 
  except a 4chan search gets the page as a result and 4chan also has randoms who post cp occasionally . 
  just typed in 8chan in google search . 
  if you keep saying that it might even become true . 
   that was very temporary it 's still in effect , any search just brings up a host of articles about the removal and a reddit sub for it . 
   they have been very against censoring search results in the past . 
  in this thing called western democracy people can hold views that are contrary to the mainstream , to single out one group as dangerous would be wrong .

  [ everything wrong with modern architecture . 
  ] ( http://www.equilibrium-economicum.net/urbanism.htm )  refusal to design new buildings compatible with their surroundings  this refusal is clearly liked with the rejection of tradition . 
  ** it also reflects the lack of a sense of community . 
  ** the architect says , in effect : ** i do n't care about the 18th or 19th century character of this district , i have to put up a new building here and i am going to express my modernist ideas ** , whether or not they sit well with their surroundings . 
  ** i am not here for the good of the local community ** , to contribute to the harmony of the city ; ** i am here to demonstrate my own originality ** . 
  new architecture has no merit unless it reflects innovation and change . 
  like frank sinatra , i 'm doing it my way . 
  face it the only people that really love the modern arts are the money launderers . 
  yuo must be of genius architect . 
  it 's shit . 
   turks in germany voted 53 percent in favor of the akp , while , mirroring the trend worldwide , second place went to the hdp with 17 percent . 
  the akp was especially strong in western european countries where there is a large turkish diaspora , coming first in germany , france , the netherlands , belgium , austria and norway . 
  at the same time , voters in most arab countries , particularly in north africa , also opted for the ruling party .
