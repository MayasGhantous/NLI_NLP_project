   oh man , the gloating from the eu apologists/authoritarians in this thread is incredibly telling . 
  it is a bit off-putting . 
  the law has shown it 's teeth , do n't be surprised if more eurosceptic parties arise . 
  some crazy people in this world . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55tm6vag2sa ) i think . 
   what an efficient nation japanese are . 
  i 'd like to see a competition between the japanese and the germans . 
  are these guys serious ? 
  had a hard time trying to read the middle english . 
   you 're the enemy , i. e. a bad person , ergo you ca n't have the same opinion as them , because that would make you a good person . 
  much easier to demonize others than having to understand their viewpoints . 
  how can you have a rational discussion on the migrant situation in europe when the mass media goes out of it 's way to outright lie about the situation , and it is largely the english speaking press that i have seen doing this . 
  i was going to go through this article and show all the outright lies but it is a recurring theme to all these propaganda pieces . 
  the tldr is : much lies and distortions abound . 
  why ? 
  i ca n't imagine the amount of dedication and passion it took to learn the language and then perform this . 
   troll * in internet slang , a troll ( / \u02c8tro\u028al / , / \u02c8tr\u0252l / ) is a person who sows discord on the internet by starting arguments or upsetting people , by posting inflammatory , [ 1 ] extraneous , or off-topic messages in an online community ( such as a newsgroup , forum , chat room , or blog ) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response [ 2 ] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion , [ 3 ] often for their own amusement . 
   angela merkel is one of the few remaining big political leaders thinking about the future , not about knee-jerk reactions of / r/europe 's unemployed patriots . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/refugee-policy-of-chancellor-merkel-divides-europe-a-1053603.html ) article suggests that merkel 's policies are knee-jerk emotional ones rather than forward thinking pragmatism . 
   1 ) bigger naval mission in the mediterranean but this naval mission will bring any smugglers and their cargo to europe so it 's not exactly a deterrent . 
   this leads to two highly entrenched camps of howler monkey flinging shit over the moderate 's heads and incites people to make comepletely nonsense posts like yours . 
  i am getting close to no longer giving a fuck , because being a moderate just means you get to fight two groups of extremists and want to calm down both the camps that should `` racists ! '', 
  and those that shout `` hippies ! '', 
  in vaguely accusatory tones . 
  i sympathise with your situation . 
   nobody is perfect , but being english is close enough . 
   god save our queen . 
  lel , it 's a good thing i 'm part english . 
  you are making the assumption that this number will spread out within the european union . 
   and yet the numbers tell a dramatically different story . 
  with turkey hosting close to 3 million refugees , jordan close to 1 million , and lebanon well over 1 million , and with the resilience of states such as lebanon and jordan being openly questioned , to doubt that europe can integrate hundreds of thousands -- or , indeed , millions -- of refugees is ludicrous . 
  the amount of resources spent to house refugees in europe is vastly different from that spent outside of europe you might as well compare apples to oranges . 
  i do n't know the exact numbers but turkey spent five to six billion on almost two million refugees , and germany is set to spend six billion on the estimated eight hundred thousand refugees this year . 
  * 1 the economist and all those other 's listed have consistently been pumping out propaganda , heck the comment section 's of those sites have been very critical of the articles in question . 
  * 2 drowned baby , need i say more ? 
  * 3 i 'll concede number three . 
  * 4 the video that they cite as an example was used in an article by german media , i have not seen any evidence that it is fake . 
  * 5 drowned baby . 
  * 6 this is common on both sides of the political decide as is the rest of the points brought up . 
  please let this happen , i would pay good money to see this . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkaj4b0xymi ), 
  i must be in the small but elite minority that does not find monty python funny , at all . 
  do n't forget the squat man . 
  they supported the people who went on to become isis , heck there is even a picture with mccain with some of them . 
  the spy rocks were actually true . 
  except we know that members of the fsa left to join al nusra and isis . 
  it starts small then end 's up where [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckeej9n8xw ) is acceptable behaviour . 
   in 2017 , after the whole refugee-crisis , a new age nostradamus are we . 
  you mean aid like the one that was recently found by the greeks to contain weapons and ammo ? 
  do n't know what it is about that song but i could feel my eardrums moving even though my speaker volume is pretty low . 
  i mean the first time it happened , i do n't even know when it started happening . 
  the first time i hear about this i was astonished at how i had never seen this on the television , surely a grenade attack in a city is worthy of some international news time especially if that is a european city . 
  no , just that he is using their [ ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_hegemony ) to achieve his own goals . 
  ask yourself who benefits the most from mass immigration and multiculturalism , and then ask yourself why it is so widely accepted that to question it brings about accusations of racism . 
   do you want that ? 
  if it was n't done in a forced manner then i do n't see how i could object , the current situation on the other hand goes directly against the will of the people . 
   people in europe after generations of fighting each other learned to live together peacefully . 
  discovered that being together gives stronger economical benefits than fighting . 
  european countries have more or less same values and principals . 
  the prevailing orthodoxy is that all cultures are equal , if this is your world-view then you would obviously see no difference between the nigerian and the swede , they are interchangeable parts of the machine . 
   kravtsov -- ** who had worked for russia 's gru military intelligence agency ** as an engineer specializing in satellites between 1990 and 2005 -- was arrested on a moscow street by security service officers and charged with treason . 
   after leaving the gru in 2005 , according to his wife , ** kravtsov worked at a series of state defense companies -- quitting each time ** after becoming disillusioned with the level of corruption and incompetence . 
  probably was under surveillance because of that . 
   in the twisted mind of masochistic leftist insanity , valuing your countries ' citizens well being above others is racist nowadays . 
  for me , and for most sane people , dare i say the majority of the world , citizenship is much more important than race ( something that does n't really exist , scientifically speaking ) , religion , political allignment , etc. 
  if this is about immigration , i 'm not even against it for actual asylum seekers , no matter their numbers , but i will always put romanians , europeans and western people first , in that order ( no matter their race , ancestry , religion ) simply because they probably share my values and my collective ( factually superior ) civilization . 
  believe it or not but i actually agree with you , however for the majority of people on this site and in western society in general if you publicly said such a thing you would be treated exactly the same as the person who wants to `` save the white race '' . 
  a place that celebrates freedom of expression ? 
  maybe if you are interested in politics , but the general populace are ignorant of such things . 
  i always found it funny how populism is used as a slur , i mean if you are in a democracy the most democratic thing would be to follow the will of the people . 
  another word i have noticed lately is nativism , usually it is used instead of just outright calling people racist . 
  a few people i read have mentioned how much of what the soviets did is being put into practice in our society 's . 
  do n't know much about the wider situation , my dad was n't to keen on talking about that stuff . 
  his family was to poor there was n't enough food to go around . 
   why though ? 
  i 'd like to quote my colleague jiri weigl , who believes that it is in fact ** the purpose of the `` welcome politics '' towards migrants is to permanently destroy the cohesion of the current societies in europe ** . 
  only on the ruins of the `` old societies '' can the politicians erect their `` new europe '' - obviously without those of us who are content with our current europe . 
  the migrants should become the `` first members of the desired european nation '' , according to weigl . 
  there have been a few who have spoken openly about their desire to do just this . 
  since this was an initiation rite how many of britain 's `` elite '' have gone through the same thing ? 
  what is n't a social construct . 
  for the entirety of europe i doubt it , but for countries like sweden it is a very real possibility . 
  * give up on regime change . 
  * establish enclaves in syria , libya and wherever else there is a refugee crisis . 
  * instead of granting asylum to a handful of people ensure that the maximum amount of aid is given to people in the enclaves , for the same amount of money it takes to house a few thousand in europe you could help even more people in these enclaves . 
  i recall something about a teacher in sudan maybe who named a teddy bear mohammed in-front of her class , i have n idea if she was sentenced to death though . 
  what gave me away ? 
  nothing to be ashamed of , it is scientifically proven that women find hairy men more manly . 
  i suppose you also judge [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vrcab8zyga ) man as an asshole too ? 
  i know , i have the proof right in-front of me . 
  people have been murdered over drawings , to call the people who are putting there lives at risk `` assholes '' makes you the asshole . 
  let me say it one more time . 
  ** people have been murdered over drawings ** . 
  in europe , not in pakistan or saudi arabia but in europe , you should maybe reflect on your cowardice to confront such an ideology that can produce people who do this . 
  you are quite the sick individual . 
   the sole purpose of this is to piss off people explicitly because he is painting caricatures of the prophet muhammad . 
  is there anything wrong with that ? 
  you can draw a stick figure and that will still piss of the muslims , so long as you call it mohammed . 
  why are you so offended on behalf of a foreign religion that any harm he may receive you seem to imply would be deserved , maybe even a just response ? 
  take good care of them man .
