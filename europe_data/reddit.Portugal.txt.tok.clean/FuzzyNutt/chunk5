  are you saying that there are no poor people in europe ? 
   i do n't think there 's a single competent politician in the entire european union . 
  is nationalism necessarily conservative ? 
  what goes into the white sausages ? 
  maybe historically it was bad and the reputation just stuck around , like the french and surrender . ^ sorry :p, 
   a politician who proclaimed that mohammed would be considered a pedophile according to today 's laws was not sentenced for blasphemy but for `` hate speech '' . 
  what was the result ? 
  re re conquista when bro ? 
  all the complainers about british food are just jealous of the english breakfast . 
   nus looks like terrible stuff , all you snuss takers need to find jesus . 
  did you say [ black ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc1zgrupztc ) ? , that 's waycist . 
   i guarantee not 1 % of all the fuckers , who support this kind of oppression of those who are n't eager to share their livelihood , would go for it . 
  and of that 1 % a good 2/3 of them would back out before even meeting a single refugee . 
  so long as someone else pays for it its free right ? 
  compassion without the effort of having to do anything . 
   the wealthy understand the demographic problems and how it 's connected to the country 's wellbeing much better than your average joe . 
  ( controlled ) migration is a must-have if the goal is to maintain the living standards . 
  you do n't have to be an evil capitalist to understand this . 
  there is obviously something fundamentally wrong with the economics in developed countries that acts as a disincentive to people having children , mass immigration is a short term economic fix with long term social problems entailed . 
  `` if you 're white , science says you 're probably a racist . 
  now what ? '', 
  one of the articles available on that site . 
  very tragic i 'm sure . 
  i never looked at it that way before , thanks for broadening my perspective . 
  what is this , stop giving us facts ivan , russia bad everyone else good . 
  conservative now a days seems to be someone who is in favour of big business , privatisation and globalisation , the only time they seem to act `` conservative '' is to oppose meaningless issues such as gay marriage . 
  maybe he is thinking of mashed potatoes ? 
   arabic numerals someone should educate him on their [ origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hindu%e2%80%93arabic_numeral_system ) . 
   it does and i totally agree with you and so i have to say i fall on the side of the wealthy in terms of not wanting to deal with it as well . 
  i am not rich by any means but i have never been at the bottom either . 
  the problem is that it is these very same middle to upper class people who are most in favour of multiculturalism and mass immigration . 
  lady 's and gentlemen , i present you you the [ e-team ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvonyvsqom ) . 
   6 hours long god . 
   immigrants less likely to commit crimes than local population . 
  that is still not factual . 
  and the guy who raped a twelve year old in sweden . 
   could the downvoters please explain what 's so great about `` you 're entitled to rule a nation and a better human being because of which family you 're born in '' ? 
  the reason that they were `` entitled '' to rule a nation is because they managed to coerce or convince enough people to support them . 
  thanks to you i found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblqzytf_ly ) little gem . 
  at least it 's not community service . 
  i think it was 15 % illiterate . 
  they are explaining the european refugee crisis , whilst attempting to conflate the entirety of the masses of people as being syrian , which by the numbers germany is finding does not match that perception . 
  some of them [ do n't ] ( https://youtu.be/hzmgyfqnvvu?t=2m27s ) like us very much . 
  english is the only language i speak . 
  the ** european refugee crisis ** , the one that 's in the news right this very moment , that 's where the 20 % figure comes from . 
  * the ** european refugee crisis ** and syria explained thats the title of this thread and the video title , your claim would make more sense if the title was . 
  * the syria refugee crisis explained, 
   seems a lot of people here wish they lived in japan though . 
  please no , leave my waifus alone !, 
  * hugs *, 
  it 's not exactly an easy question to answer , for me broadly speaking i 'd say culturally and ethnically is what i consider a european . 
  as an example i consider americans ( north and south ) to be variants of european . 
   i do n't understand how that means we should n't be helping syrian refugees ? 
  i have n't seen anyone make this argument . 
  its funny in a way though.in a few threads i have seen people complaining about being called nazis , these people have in turn been told that they are just making it up or maybe they are trying to head of criticism , and then here in this thread two posts already claiming `` racists '' , `` nazis '' . 
   apparently being not unconditionaly pro immigration gives you several phobias . 
  also dead babies man , you would n't want to be responsible for that again right ? 
   only 20 % he is talking about the current crisis . 
   people will assimilate quickly ... so long as we are accepting , and welcoming . 
  the ** reality ** is quite different from your assertion . 
   do say ? 
  why would they do that ? 
  if they could just go back home . 
  or back to those great turkish and lebanese camps . 
  that would be great , would n't it ? 
  what they could try doing is respecting the laws of the countries to which they are asking help from , is this to much to ask ? 
   how is that in any way indicative for the notion that the would would n't agree to a process were they were distrubuted throughout the eu as long as they got asylum ?!, 
  its like your just throwing stuff at the wall , assuming it will stick . 
  when people criticize these people for wanting to go to specific countries a whole host of excuses are given , they want the best start in life , or , they want to be reunited with family . 
  what will change between what is happening now and the future that will alter this behaviour ? 
  it is a perfectly reasonable assumption that certain countries will be favourite destinations for migrants . 
   you know , if some of them are demanding something , it means that every last one of them are the same . 
  carry on . 
  there was an awful lot of them trying to break into hungary . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34270077 ) is some info from a source used in the video . 
   ** syrians are a small minority of those seeking refuge in germany **  while the tragedy of those fleeing syria 's terrible civil war has caught the popular imagination , such people formed just 20.1 % of those seeking asylum in germany from january to august 2015 . 
  if the makers of this video were such a reputable group they obviously know this information , why are they misrepresenting what is going on ? 
   comeon now you 're not even trying !, 
  it 's not like poland is getting its doors bashed down by people clamouring to get in , shit even austria got bypassed in favour of germany . 
  based on the choices in which this current and the previous waves of migrants decided to settle , it is reasonable to make the prediction that they will continue to do so in the future . 
   `` news '' do you mean actual video footage of refugees demanding to be let into hungary , cause `` we want germany '' . 
  we are not only dealing with syrian refugees but migrants from all over the world and he kept on conflating syrian refugees with migrants in general , it 's almost like he was trying impress on the viewer that a migrant is the same as a refugee , also the dead baby thing at the end was just really classy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:academic_use http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page346376 just like reddit has brigades so does wikipedia . 
  they say that immigrants are less likely to cause crime than locals when they are employed . 
  tell me mr swede , is this the case in your lovely country ? , or are migrants over represented in the statistics ? 
   where is this ` collective sharing of refugees initative ' that you say the syrians have outright rejected ? 
   have you been watching any news within the last few weeks ? 
  captain ausfalia to the rescue , let me guess you are from melbourne right ? 
  the gaurdian , vox , the economist , the wall street journal , wikifuckingpedia , much credible sources they are . 
  as the recent crisis has shown this 1 % increase will not consent to be spread out around europe . 
  they make an assumption that the majority of these migrants will get work , and they are also leading people to the conclusion that the current refugee influx is only a temporary thing . 
  and the sources , wikipedia , a bunch of news outlets , the majority of those sources are heavily biased towards mass immigration , you might as well use russia today as a source when talking about ukraine . 
   before that there was a lot of pro-federalism threads here . 
  the mild taste of what federalism would entail vis-a-vis quotas , has probably soured many people against ever closer union . 
  `` immigrants less likely to commit crimes than local population , ** when allowed to work ** . '', 
  this person also assumes that there is a set number of refugees and that will be the end of it , the truth is that for the foreseeable future there is no end in sight .
