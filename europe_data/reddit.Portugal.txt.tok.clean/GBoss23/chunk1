yes you 're right . 
  but a new cold war is higly improbable . 
  there would need to happen a lot of bad events in sucession for it to start, 
  if this was n't in reddit , i would believe it . 
  russia does n't have the money for a new cold war unless they ally with china , for example . 
   apart from the united kingdom i 'm not really aware of any significant eurosceptics around , are there ? 
  eurosceptics are rising in almost all eu contries , but yeah , they are n't very big at the moment . 
   we do need more integrated eu military with an agressive great power ( russia ) in our vicinity though . 
  unfortunately , with the recent eurozone crisis ( which also affected non-euro contries ) , i do n't think eu countries will invest that much in military . 
  #portuguese master race, 
  sadly our leaders do n't think this way ... 
  if they were a player the size of italy , their conflict with ukraine would be long over . 
  yes . 
  it 's more of a cultural thing . 
  for example , most of the portuguese people will call themselves catholic , but few of them actually attend religious services , etc. 
  of course, 
  psychiatry is a field of medicine, 
  so psychology , for example , is n't a science ? 
  they are too hated to be here . 
  because it 's their language . 
  by that logic there would be only 5 or 6 languages spoken in the world . 
  being a fan of enoch powell certainly is racist . 
  but the nazi gold !, 
   where the far left just won the local elections , `` far left '' . 
  damn , the political spectrum really went to the right these recent decades . 
  indoeuropean is a very , very large group . 
  that nazi user, 
   they can all burn in hell , and they will . 
  soon . 
  do n't worry . 
  only 144.000 will not go to hell . 
  so you better watch out as well !, 
  that was in 2004 i think, 
  that ended 120 years ago, 
  yeah . 
  it 's just the russians / ukranians who will suffer , just like the koreans the other time . 
  fuck them . 
  things are getting better ... until the next crash, 
  they are/were radical as much as obama was before being elected . 
  that does n't make jean marie le pen any less reactionary . 
  there are a lot of types of reactionaries, 
  \\ #votepp 2015, 
  scottish english, 
  or immigration ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   or people value immaterial things , like free time , more than consumption . 
  a capitalist economy does n't run on immaterial things . 
  that 's why scotland should 've had become independent . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yeah ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ would n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ change ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ flag, 
  caralho = cock is mostly a brazilian thing , not portuguese . 
  so ... the social darwinists are coming back ? 
  relevant username, 
  flair checks out, 
  why do you people always have to draw comparisons with the greeks ? 
  even if there is growth . 
  it 's impossible for everyone to have surpluses, 
  that means some other countries are having bigger and bigger deficits . 
  do n't worry because you wo n't be fighting reds any time soon . 
  franco would be proud . 
  do what that chinese guy did n't , open your eyes !, 
  estonia does n't matter, 
  iraq was n't involved with 911 . 
  at most we would have invaded saudi arabia which will never happen . 
  we are so pussies and politically correct that we always follow the lead of our big brother usa to far away wars, 
   most right wing views tend to be downvoted though , you 're right about that . 
  it 's a shame , but that 's reddit for you . 
  this subreddit is no different . 
  the immigration / economic views of most of / r/europe users say otherwise . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  your country is n't as big russia . 
  renaults are in general very confortable cars . 
   many will return with foreign inspiration and expertise and make greece a better place . 
  no they wo n't ( return ), 
  his ass ? 
  why do you say russia ? 
  you do n't need to leave the eu to see those opinions . 
  based iceland, 
  at that time it was a pretty good poland considering most of today 's northern poland was majority german, 
  privacy is dead . 
  it 's a thing of the past now . 
  that was the greek votes :d, 
  this is the proof of women previlege !!, 
  the ( liberal democratic ) ^ 2 party, 
  good bye lenin ( german ), 
  holy shit bosnia, 
  it 's not the chechens as a people that are putin 's allies , it 's kadyrov who is ( and most of chechnya 's elite i guess ) . 
  in porto i do n't think so , but where i live ( vila real ) there definitely are more benfica fans, 
  life is n't a superhero movie, 
  we do n't like spain, 
  the true [ god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g-qhowqvfm ), 
  heheh ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   because he really cared about the countrly , unlike others that are corrupt and only want to make money by doing favours to companies . 
  salazar was the epitome of corporatism . 
   nevertheless he was a dictator , and some policies may 've hurt portugal 's development . 
  that 's a drastic understatement . 
  i 've never seen much love for the monarchy 's flag outside of reddit, 
   porto is the team of the whole north ;-) no it 's not . 
  it certainly is n't pro-greek, 
  says the irish . 
  the emperor had little authority outside of his realm during that time ( 18th century ),
