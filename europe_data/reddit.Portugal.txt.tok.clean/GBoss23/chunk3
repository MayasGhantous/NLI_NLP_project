  that was the habsburgs, 
  it was about / u/liam __ g not about you, 
  just to follow that guy 's argument . 
  if i said religious extremists he 'd probably call me an useful idiot or something . 
  i just said that is was a classic fascist tactic . 
  the charlie hebdo massacre was a show of a typical attack of muslim extremists . 
  i did n't even talk about muslims . 
  i thought my sarcasm was evident : <, 
  the two words are so contraditory to each other that it 's funny . 
  germans treated the old prussians so well that they all became germans . 
  i am kidding with you  . 
  i saw what you meant . 
  do n't get offended . 
  perhaps sultan erdogan should invade you and take back what should have never stopped to be ottoman . 
  eastern prussia is german clay not lithuanian clay . 
  same here in portugal . 
  that 's not the only option, 
  same here in portugal . 
  we do n't like them because they are rightful rep. of ireland clay . 
  the french muslims would become more radical . 
  germoney is n't enough for you . 
  you need chinamoney . 
  tell that to south america . 
  we may have ... uuhh ... received ... uuhh ... a few bribes . 
  one of the reasons might be that they assimilated quicklier than the other groups , due to a relatively similar culture to the anglo-saxon one . 
  yes because big business / big industries will be weakened if ttip passes . 
  flawless logic . 
  putting anti-vaxx and anti-ttip in the same box is like saying fascism is just like socialism . 
  more power to the president ( erdogan ) . 
  the real question here is : can erdogan ride a bear ? 
  he 's a muslim aswell . 
  i was kidding  . 
  a lot of people in / r/europe simply dismiss a comment from russian users , simply because of the flair , regardless of what he says . 
  we need more people like alex jones ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  right sector is one of the most anti-russia groups in ukraine lol . 
  you really like memes do n't you ? 
  no we do n't, 
  why take alsace when you can take all of france ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ eu ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ literally ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 4th ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ reich, 
   btw , they do still have problems integrating their black population that 's an euphemism, 
  how is what he says marxist in any way ? 
  propably an ancap , which is as anarchist as fascism . 
  the good old `` rich create the jobs '' myth . 
  russia is behind him . 
  well , porto ( and portugal north of river douro ) is part of the historical region of galicia . 
  [ spain in this case . 
  the estonian complaining about bias . 
  `` i 'm a commie '' - fdr, 
  i was n't being serious yo, 
  do you live in russia ? 
  itt : kill those goddamn brown people . 
  someone is butthurt, 
  but ... brown people man !, 
  not corfu !, 
  it 's the uk way : get the good parts of the eu , do n't get the bad parts of the eu . 
  i do n't know how the falklands issue is a social issue, 
  he 's russian . 
  he 's always drunk . 
  we love the children !, 
  * literally * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yes i know ( did n't see the show though ) . 
  it was a rethorical question . 
  how many of those sang in english ? 
  we found the muslim extremist . 
  inb4 reddit banned in turkey, 
  so ... of all these nations , how much of them sang in their native languages ? 
  you probably would n't like lynching of blacks , would you ? 
  [ hello jucker ] ( http://www.konsolifin.net/ylli/upload/jutut/filmi/1348147923_aladeen2.jpg ), 
  last election was very close percentage wise . 
  the problem is the retarded uk fptp system . 
  they would probably have a dark blue all over them, 
  yeah . 
  a little knowledge on psychology debunks those arguments . 
  even if they are well informed , the decisions are n't always rational . 
  our decision making is way more emotional than rational . 
  there are some who also do n't want us in the eu, 
  you merely adopted the corruption ... we were born in it , molded by it . 
  a little bit more and you invite all the eu . 
  well , i would say that in your country politicians are more open about it than here . 
  in pratice it basically is the same / is becoming the same . 
  longest ( i think ) : otorrinolaringologista shortest : o , a , e, 
  so ... just like obama ? 
  that 's not that simple . 
  because freedom ^ ^ ^ tm still has n't penetrated this type of oil ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   private universities are looked down upon especially - it means that you were not good enough to get to one of the public ones and are essentially paying for degree paper noone even takes seriously . 
  pretty much like here in portugal , except for some which are good . 
  they are being defunded more and more every year, 
  i hope you 're kidding, 
  til portugal is a desert, 
  that poland is so ugly, 
  crimea and novorossiya to russia ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  and whataboutism is very good except when the russian shills use it right ? 
  everyone said it would be a easy semi-final for real madrid , and look how that turned out . 
  expect everything . 
  are we becoming a military cult ? 
  ethiopia is coptic, 
  `` american left '', 
  i think you should go to liberland, 
  edgy much ? 
  prepare yourself for another dose of reforms ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ),
