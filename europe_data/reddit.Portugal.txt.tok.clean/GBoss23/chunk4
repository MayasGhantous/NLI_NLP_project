  yay let 's all drop our languages and speak english everywhere !, 
  one of us ( northern portugal here ) ... one of us ... 
  yes , because serbia is clearly the bad guy in this situation . 
  most people when they see a spaniard will try to speak spanish for him , instead of him trying to speak portuguese . 
  the same occurs with every other nationality . 
  it seems like english-speaking expats are always like that . 
  here in portugal there are a lot of british old people living in algarve , that do n't say a thing in portuguese . 
  yes , everyone bows down to a foreigner , because we are the worst . 
  ca n't you recognise sarcasm ?

  two words : red scare, 
  you 're not even trying, 
  and leftists in general, 
  you should thank all your social rights to the typical leftists, 
  well reddit is n't really composed of working class people . 
  that is n't really true . 
  the us had a very big labor movement during the late 19th century until the 50s when the red scare happened . 
  so what about before the war ? 
  they were strong countries and there were no marshall plan . 
  not to mention other countries also had the marshall plan and they are n't nearly as in a good `` shape '' as germany . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  except 70 years ago they actually destroyed the country you 're speaking of, 
  germany and japan did n't become what they are because of the us, 
  kazakhstan greatest country in the world, 
  nice try, 
  well we are so poor not even refugees want to come over here . 
  you forced the libertarian part a little bit , no ? 
  well that 's like that over here . 
  my grandma who is 73 years old and has some leg problems had until very recently some cows and a donkey . 
  she did n't want to sell the animals because she fears now she wo n't do nothing . 
  putin, 
  fair enough, 
  seems like you got lost plenty more times since you got there relatively recently, 
  i 've never seen spanish people blame their situation on foreigners . 
  no they would n't, 
  shameful ? 
  then volunteer yourself and join the ukranians at the front of the war . 
  india is accelerating now just like china was 30 years ago . 
  india is years behind china . 
  would a swedish worker want to gain as much as a chinese worker ? 
  finland ( and europe ) will never be able to compete with the likes of bangladesh , india or vietnam , for example , despite the eforts made by some people, 
  he 's talking about turkey and considered their birth rate which is very high compared to ours for example . 
  muslims most likely, 
  i 'm laughing so much with this !, 
  where did you get those images ? 
  the bordergore man ... 
  so according to you the us biggest allies in the middle east are more hostile to it than iran .

  `` people feel safe '', 
  when famine strikes , latvia will be the only one surviving . 
  ^ ^ ^ unless ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ irish ^ ^ ^ famine ^ ^ ^ type, 
  i did n't blame the us alone there , i blamed the western powers in general . 
  the thing that was common in all of them was the [ shield ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/list_of_portuguese_flags#/historical_flags ) in the middle . 
  lybia only became a fuck-up recently when freedom ^ ^ tm was brought to them . 
  we only had that flag from 1830 to 1910 lol, 
  i know . 
  i was just pointing out that in portugal , at least from my perception , the bad economic situation is key . 
  europe in general seems to be child unfriendly today , but in our country the economic situation probably plays the most important role, 
  i think they use `` our '' calendar now . 
  if only moldova could become something like switzerland . 
  if the nazi plans were true , then the genocide that would happen would be far worse . 
  i 'm not a fan of stalin either .

  everyone know he 's an african muslim and a secret lover of isis . 
  because william wallace and freeeedoooom, 
  of course you are . 
  you 've been friends with them since the cold war , because their greatest enemy , india , has `` socialist '' on its name . 
  we agree there . 
  must have been the ottomans who brought them from asia . 
  but everyone knows that this is the forth reich !, 
  merkel germany this time !, 
  there are a lot of types of socialism . 
  his type of socialism does n't seem to be the marxist type . 
  why ? 
  do n't you like croissants and omelete du fromage ? 
  we will probably destroy the planet first with nukes . 
  talk about hamburgers and you 're fine . 
  so your behaviour is based on pissing russians ?
