that means nothing if they do n't have the capabilities and money to launch them . 
  do they ? 
  do you even read my comments ? 
  i have other books to read . 
  i wo n't just read a book because an internet stranger told me so . 
  although i do find the premise of the book interesting , i currently have other priorities . 
  oh , i 'm sorry i do n't have the time to read a goodamn book just to understand your argument . 
  that 's something completely different . 
  these law changes affected directly the world cup . 
  if crimea is part of russia there is no effect on the world cup . 
  like i said , fifa cares only about football . 
  i 'll just repeat what i have said :  fifa is a non-political organization . 
  if the russian federation of football gives them a video showing crimea as a part of russia they can not complain about it . 
   uhmm ... 
  i have n't heard of any sanctions or condemnations by fifa . 
  and why should they be making them ? 
  fifa is a non-political organization . 
  if the russian federation of football gives them a video showing crimea as a part of russia they can not complain about it . 
  huh , what ? 
  just because fifa shows crimea as part of russia it does n't mean russia has gone unpunished . 
  what about the sanctions ? 
  the un condemnation ? 
  obviously they are nothing compared to fifa showing a map with crimea identified as part of russia . 
  unfortunately , i have other books to read and would rather if you explained me right now why he is wrong . 
  crimea appearing as part of russia in fifa video = you can do whatever you want to weaker neighbours , as long as you have oil money and enough power that 's some interesting logic . 
  instead of linking a book expecting us to buy and read it just because you asked can you make an actual coherent argument ? 
   his comment confirms how much sweden loves tourists , especially russian tourists . 
  this after another incursion by sea after an incursion into swedish airspace earlier . 
  ( incursions into airspace are very serious , usually , the threat remains limited to adiz . 
  no , he just said that they loved tourists in general . 
   seriously , people on reddit who use the `` term '' edgy to gain the upper hand without making an effort are making me cringe . 
  seriously , people who use ad hominem in arguments annoy me . 
  yes , and how does that relate to his comment ? 
  seriously , your edgy `` ebil russianz '' comment was uncalled for . 
  your point being ? 
  i 'm really tired of this `` no one expected ww1 '' bs . 
  everyone wanted war , germanophobia was on the rise , the french wanted alsace-lorraine back , the german naval buildup was scaring the british , tensions in the balkans were pretty high , the german high command thought a war with russia was necessary and lots of other things made ww1 inevitable and predictable . 
   for compesation finland would have gotten a small piece of their east-karelia . 
  that small piece is double the size of the territory the soviet union asked for . 
   finland did n't like the idea of the soviet millitary base so close to the capital . 
  and the soviet union did n't like the idea of axis armies a few miles from their second city . 
   then the soviets attacked . 
  they installed a communist puppet government in a captured village , and declared that finland will be the finnish democratic republic and it will be united with the soviet karelia , like finland has always wanted . 
  they signed a mutual assistance agreement with the puppet goverment that was supposed to be confirmed in helsinki `` as soon as possible '' . 
   they used the same excuse with the baltic states and were at the moment in agreement with the nazi germany . 
  they wanted protect the border from the british and french , not from germany , according to them . 
  in november 1940 molotov visited germany and asked them a permission to solve `` the finnish question '' . 
  now germany said no ( well , they said maybe later ) . 
  by the time peace was signed , the finnish frontlines had been broken . 
  if the soviet union had wanted all of finland , they would have simply continued the war for a few more weeks . 
   soviets aimed to quickly conquer the whole finland in winter war . 
  wrong . 
  the soviets wanted to push the border away from leningrad because they were afraid finland might align with germany . 
  the soviets even offered part of karelia in exchange for it , but the finns refused . 
  you can read all about that [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/background_of_the_winter_war#soviet_demands_in_late_1939 ) . 
   alsace-lorraine speaking german in your dreams . 
   [ although german dialects were spoken in alsace for most of its history , the dominant official language in alsace today is french . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alsace#language ) there are more errors in this map , but i 'm not bothered to point them all out . 
  mapping languages is not easy . 
  i never said you were . 
  and now you resort to insulting me . 
  you 're not very good at this , are you ? 
  freedom includes privacy . 
  yes ? 
  the war on terror ? 
  giving away your privacy in order to lower the risk of a terrorist attack ? 
  except nato , you mean ? 
   they have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom on the alter of promised higher standards of living . 
   no western country would ever do that . 
  [ ahem ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_on_terror ), 
  we do n't exist ? 
   he is delusional . 
  baltics have to lose the most in case of war . 
  no one wants that here . 
  the reason we are so vocal is precisely because we are in the biggest danger , not because we want war . 
  if you actually thought a bit , you 'd realize that russia would never attack a nato member . 
  so quit fearmongering . 
  yes , where is your argument ? 
  oh , wait , there is none , just a baseless insult . 
  lol , people are already chanting war on streets and russia did n't even attack a nato member . 
  come back to reality , mate . 
   it 's the exact same quote , only differently worded . 
  do i need to point out that those are mutually exclusive or did you already figure that out by yourself ? 
  no , by khruschev .

  i think he meant efta countries . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  zhirinovsky is not supposed to be taken seriously . 
  he has , among other things , threatened to change the gravitional field of earth so the us is sunk and called the us a nation of faggots , cocksuckers and handjobbers . 
  not only that , but he 's been pretty frank about his hatred for turks and people from the caucasus mountains , as well as his desire for the chinese and japanese to be deported from russia . 
  he 's warned america several times to be careful about turning the country over to the blacks . 
  he wants to forcibly take back alaska because it 'll be `` a great place to keep the ukranians . '' in zhirinovsky 's dream world , all of the former soviet countries will get back together , the ethnic minorities will murder each other , russians will rule , georgians will serve as slaves , and the baltic countries will be used for the dumping of nuclear waste . 
  oh , and they need to seize afghanistan and the middle east so that russians have somewhere warm to go on vacation . 
  when the bird flu was spreading around the world in 2006 , world leaders everywhere were scrambling and trying to figure out what to do . 
  but zhirinovsky , who is a man of action , came up with a simple solution : just shoot all the birds . 
  he argues that if women were self-sufficient , they would n't need the endless supply of furs and shoes that apparently drives men to their graves .
