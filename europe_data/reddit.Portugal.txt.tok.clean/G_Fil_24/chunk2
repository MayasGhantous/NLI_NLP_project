  and in 2006 , zhirinovsky proposed that polygamy be legalized in russia . 
  seriously , ignore him . 
  please do . 
  not only that , but the influx of tourists would generate a lot of money . 
  where are ours anyway ? 
  we had one in colombo , but i 'm not sure if it 's even there anymore . 
  oops . 
  i completely forgot . 
  that was dumb in my part . 
  well , sorry if i somehow hurt your feelings . 
  it was never my intention . 
  except lithuania does n't border russia . 
  i 'm not sure what the relevancy of that is . 
  but whatever . 
  1 - well , he may have not directly insulted me , but he was just disrespectful . 
  he indirectly compared me to a conspiracy nut , who ignores facts , even though another redditor showed how i was wrong and i respectfully acknowledged that . 
  2 - why am i in the wrong place ? 
  3 - i 'm just gon na ignore this comment since it 's ridiculous and immature . 
  because i do not take insults lightly . 
  i did not jump to conclusions . 
  let me repeat what i have said before :  i never said this was some kind of conspiracy perpetrated by the jews or whatever , the tinfoil hat title was just because i could not think about another title . 
  i simply noticed a discrepancy and posted about it on reddit to see what you guys thought about it . 
  a redditor cleared that up and i acknowledged the fact . 
  i 'm not sure what 's the problem ? 
  i did . 
  so it was a coincidence you posted the general remark in my thread ? 
  i never said this was some kind of conspiracy perpetrated by the jews or whatever , the tinfoil hat title was just because i could not think about another title . 
  i simply noticed a discrepancy and posted about it on reddit to see what you guys thought about it .

  i 'm not sure what 's the problem ? 
  makes sense . 
  well , i just noticed this and thought it meant something . 
  but whatever . 
  have a rest of a good day . 
  [ i do n't see any storm over the sea of azov . 
  ] ( http://www.accuweather.com/en/ua/ukraine-weather ), 
  it 's called the art of politics . 
  1 - so stalin genocided the baltic peoples and now they hate russians ? 
  seems a bit weird since after all stalin was georgian . 
  2 - estonians and russians were in the exact same soviet union , how were the estonians not affected and the russians were ? 
  are the estonians somehow superior ? 
  3 - so since russians were brainwashed , they should all die ? 
  seems a bit immoral to me . 
  i 'm not talking about russians , i 'm talking about estonians , ukrainians , etc. 
  they were also in the soviet union . 
  does that include the baltics and the ukraine ? 
  i assume so , since they were also in the soviet union . 
   he is having a really hard time being a dictator and one of the richest man on earth he might be an asshole , but he is n't the asshole he is made out to be . 
  believe it or not , he has done various good things for russia : [ * during putin 's eight years in office , industry grew substantially , as did production , construction , real incomes , credit , and the middle class . 
  putin has also been praised for eliminating widespread barter and thus boosting the economy . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_putin#domestic_policies ) i can get more examples if you want . 
   like wtf is going on with this pro-russian victimhood lately . 
  what ? 
  no , just what ? 
  every single pro-russian post in this subreddit has been downvoted to hell , no matter how considerate it is . 
  i challenge you to find a post who has a positive outlook on russia that is not downvoted to hell . 
   a guy who turns his whole country against gay people . 
  completely straight-up wrong . 
  putin simply used his legislative power to fall in the graces of both the church and the homophobe russians . 
  putin did n't make them hate gays , they already hated them . 
  whatever . 
  mind explaining me the relevancy of your comment to the discussion ? 
   because a quarter of a billion people speak it ? 
  why not learn mandarim ? 
  french ? 
  spanish ? 
  but whatever dude . 
  i 'm portuguese , think otherwise if you want . 
   you said that in a direct response to me . 
  do n't act coy . 
  you convenientely ignored the rest of my argument regarding this point . 
  please adress it before i adress yours . 
   no , it 's not , because i 'm not defending a position . 
  i literally did n't address any point or argument you made , only that you 're `` cute '' for waltzing in and insulting me . 
  let me cite wikipedia first : * tu quoque [ ... ] is an argument that intends to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position . 
  * now let me apply it to this situation : * / u/jebusgobson is discrediting / u/g _ fil_24 's position ( that / u/jebusgobson commited an ad hominem fallacy ) by asserting that / u/g _ fil_24 failed to act in consistency to this position . 
  ( / u/g _ fil_24 commited the fallacy previously ) * now explain to me how this is not an ad hominem ? 
   secondly , a `` tu quoque '' fallacy would n't be a `` whole new fallacy '' , because a `` tu quoque '' fallacy is an `` ad hominem '' . 
  whatever . 
  in my sources they are listed as different fallaccies , if your information differs , do n't blame me for it . 
   yeah , i speak more than one language too . 
  does n't prove anything . 
  but it does n't matter , i guess . 
  keep doubting , whatever . 
  it does n't affect me in the least . 
  besides , why the hell would a russian learn portuguese ? 
   you 're the one that strode in and called me a `` putinophobe '' . 
  you do realize that , do n't you ? 
  i can link you back to the post you made 36 minutes ago , if you want . 
  saying the putinphobia is high in this subreddit does not equal calling you a putinphobe . 
  besides , that was an offhand comment and my reply would work perfectly without it . 
  the same could not be said about your comment . 
  even better than that , this is a whole new fallacy : ** tu quoque ** !, 
  amazing , right ? 
  i wonder what fallacy you will commit next ? 
   you 're posting about russia all over the place . 
  it 's almost the only fucking thing you post about . 
  is there any problem with liking playing the devil 's advocate ? 
  but since you took an affection for checking my post history , [ here 's me talking to my * compatriotas * ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/22mx8w/portuguese_galleon_flor_de_la_mar_which_is/cgohy7i ) . 
   i do n't want to argue with you .
