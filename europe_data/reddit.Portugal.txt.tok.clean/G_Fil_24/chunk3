  then do n't bother replying , retard . 
   anyone who writes something like  topkek  is n't worthy of my time . 
  so because i wrote something like that i must be inferior to you and not worthy of your attention ? 
  ah , reddit 's good ol' superiority complex . 
  got ta love your lack of an argument . 
  topkek the putinphobia in this subreddit is getting to unsupportable levels . 
  putin was just asked if the name of the city could be changed if the residents wanted and he said something along the lines of whatever , do whatever you want . 
  what ? 
  which behaviour ? 
  it is equally ridiculous and untrue . 
  the one who spews propaganda appears to be you , insulting the russian people . 
  can you read ? 
   ** not much changed really . 
  ** * russians * ** still ** have very little regard for human life . 
  he was ** not ** refering to the 1944 * soviet * ( not russian ) army generals , in fact he was saying the opposite . 
  / u/donvito did say a phrase with the same meaning , and i have linked to it in my above comment , although he may have not used the exact same words . 
   [ russians still have very little regard for human life . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28b6jv/lithuania_vs_ussr_a_secret_hot_fight_in_the_cold/ci9nnm6 ), 
  that is still a long way from proving that every russian despises human life . 
  yes , of course all 150 million russians are responsible for what a few members of the government did . 
  you are disgusting . 
  show me someone who was put on jail for writing a book with a different point of view in russia . 
  this was probably incorrectly translated . 
  `` medium tension '' would be more fitting . 
  and we would get the mapa cor-de-rosa . 
  even if it was ( it is n't , there guys there from both the russian federation and the russian empire ) , russia is the sucessor state of the soviet union and there are only one or two things who were made by guys outside the rsfsr .

  yes , because all of belarus and all of ukraine were part of poland . 
  the point was that it was not fair to call the russians nazis , not that crimea ca n't be compared to sudetenland . 
  i ca n't see how i can put it any simpler than this . 
  yes , but that 's not the point . 
  whoever manages . org would probably shut it down . 
  and you think calling the russians nazis , which slayed russians by the millions , is fair ? 
   . su is administered by russia , how did they avoid `` being accused of working with russians '' when they chose top level domain of a bygone era that is typical of extreme russian imperialism ( soviet times ) ? 
  it 's easier to be accused of working with the russians when you have russian tld than when you have a soviet tld . 
  also , the soviet times were totally not an example of extreme russian imperialism . 
  remember , stalin was georgian . 
   you think a soviet tld is neutral ? 
  lol it 's better than a russian one . 
  that 's because it 's the only one they can use . 
  it 's not symbolic or anything . 
  if they use . ua the ukrainian government will shut it down , if they use . ru they 'll be accused of working with the russians . 
  i * totally * did not . 
  they are going to sens some intellegence satellites . 
  that 's a measly fraction of the new russian space program budget boost . 
  like it is said in the article ( it seems to me you ignore the parts that do n't back your claims ) most of the , oney will go to infrastructure and the construction of the new vostochny cosmodrome . 
  yes , i did read the article . 
  1 - wow . 
  intelligence satellites . 
  every country has one . 
  please . 
  2 - russia 's alternative to the gps . 
  what 's the problem if they do n't want to use an american sytem ? 
  we are also making galileo . 
  3 - what 's the problem with this ? 
  once more , you 're making shit up . 
  where did you pull that from ? 
  yes , he might the deputy for the space and defense industries , but budget boost is only directed only at the space program . 
  i 'm not sure where are you pulling this `` the russian space program is evil '' shit . 
  i asked for a source . 
  i ca n't find that in the article . 
  source ? 
  that 's my point . 
  russia ca n't threaten the baltic states because everyone knows they wo n't attack them ( except probably nutjobs on / r/europe ) . 
  it might be bullshit and outdated , but the world today follows this mentality . 
  nato , cis , the eu , and more are all tools to expand a sphere of influence , wether american , russian or someone else 's . 
  because they do n't need them right now . 
  if russia attacks , nato will immediatly come to the rescue . 
  putin is not stupid , so he wo n't attack them . 
  that 's refering to sochi . 
  notice the small dot next to the name . 
   it 's entirely true that native brits are now a minority in london . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_london you are apparently completely retarded . 
  those guys know shit . 
  if nato does not help any memberstate , no matter how small it is , nato would lose credibility . 
  it could mean the end of the alliance . 
  so no , nato , will help latvia/estonia . 
  which comments ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  lviv is also way too far from the border for russia to try anything . 
  we like france more than uk , our longest ally . 
  i 'm not sure what this is supposed to mean . 
  and ? 
  what about adquiring a visa ? 
  how expensive and time-consuming it was ? 
  is it as bad as people say ? 
  i was just kinda curious how infrastructure in siberia was . 
  i 've been meaning to drive across russia for a while . 
  exemplify please . 
  let them protest . 
  it 's not like russia will attack estonia . ^ something ^ something ^ nato, 
   comment exclusively on articles concerning the actions of russia some people might prefer to do that so that they do not receive downvotes in their main account . 
  ( as an ocasional supporter of russia i can assure you that most pro-russian comments are downvoted to hell )  have russian names i do n't remember most pro-russians having russian names . 
  and if they have , what is the problem ? 
  people with french or german names could n't be theoretically paid shills too ? 
   have broken english oh , so because my first language is n't english i must be a paid shill from the russian governmment ? 
  some flawless logic right here . 
  you assume correctly . 
  what ? 
  paradox games , i presume ?
