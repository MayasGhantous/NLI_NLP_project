  having talked with this guy on r/de , he 's clearly on the right of the political spectrum ( though not far-right ) . 
  so he 's not regressive left , he 's just a regressive . 
   ** 90 % of instances ** of that accusation would be resolved if people just got some fucking reading comprehension . 
  it 's just bullshit . 
  how would you explain the topic of this very reddit thread , where the victim was accused of being a racist simply for speaking out against the perpetrators ? 
  what `` reading comprehention '' would have kept her from being called a racist ? 
  similar to how `` regressives '' blame everything that does n't fit their narrative on racism/nazis/misogyny ( their own pc version of it anyway ) . 
  edit : you even have an example of it in this thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40wy40/nach_silvester%c3%bcbergriffen_in_k%c3%b6ln_onlinehetze/cyxtd0x the guy essentially victim-blames a sexual assult victim and minimizes the actions of the people threatening her . 
  ca n't get much more `` regressive '' than that . 
   it was islamists , not people on the left . 
  but sure , carry on making up your own narrative . 
  i think the point he 's making is that the `` regressive left '' is enabling the islamists ' bahaviour . 
   sorry girl , what you went through was awful , but , as far as i am concerned , the moment you do to others what people did to you , you lose all sympathy and the right to call yourself a victim . 
  christ ... i have no words . 
   currently belongs to spain  currently     no surprise anschluss , portugal , please \u0ca0_\u0ca0 oops ... freudian slip ... 
   what 's your views of the statues of augustus & julius caesar in rome ? 
  hey , at least she remembered us !, 
   can be portugalija too . 
  huh , interesting !, 
  reading it sounds similar to `` portugaliza '' , a theoretical portugal + galiza region which currently belongs to spain : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal wonder if that 's where the word may come from ? 
  this sounds like a very unlikely explanation , especially considering that the `` jungle '' camp has existed for far longer than the recent terrorist attacks . 
  yes my liege , right away !, 
   it 's just that , i also think we need to fulfil our human obligations to those who are fleeing war and persecution , where as a lot of others i argue with just want to put up some sort of giant wall and throw out all of the migrants . 
  there has to be some sort of balance . 
  we should help , but only so far as to not cause our own countries to become destabilized as well . 
  one point i take particular exception to is the fact that so many of these refugees are n't behaving like refugees , as was quite obvious when my country tried to fulfil its quota : http://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/embaixador-de-portugal-fez-operacao-de-charme-junto-de-refugiados-na-grecia-4904545.html can you understand how only 50 people accepting to be relocated here when 5000 places were made available will raise suspicion as to the motives of the remaining ~ 4950 ? 
  i ca n't imagine escaping a war-torn country and then slapping away the helping hand of a stable a safe european democracy such as portugal . 
   there 's no need for false gratitude . 
  again , afaik none of the scholarship recipients are forced to show any gratitude whatsoever , `` false '' or not . 
  you 're arguing a point that does n't exist . 
   it 's perfectly legitimate to take the scholarship , as well as attack cecil rhodes for being a monstrous imperialist and racist , ** even moreso than the standard of his time ** . 
  which is perfectly true . 
  was he worse than the standard of his time ? 
  ( serious ) please provide more sources , i 'd be interested in reading more about this . 
   i do n't think they 're so much trying to get to the uk as they are trying to get away from where they come from . 
  but ... they 're in france , they 're already away from where they came from . 
   because it 's less scary than anywhere else . 
  i do n't think they had an awful lot of options open to them . 
  any reason they are n't applying for asylum in france ( seeing that they 've already made the trip there ) , and are insistent on making their way to the uk ? 
   western media must help organise and enlighten poland , because clearly poles once again just do n't comply with the standards did you forget the '' / s '' ? 
   i think we 're far enough removed by now to stop thinking we need to fling ourselves before the rhodes statue in gratitude . 
  are any of the scholarship recipients forced to do this to receive the money ? 
  does the ritual worship of the statue you described even exist ? 
   where did i write that ? 
  this was obviously implied in your [ previous comment . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40rqsx/oxford_university_students_who_dont_like_cecil/cywk5ps )  6 million is a large number . 
  6000 is a large number too . 
  it is a large number , and is this how many people rhodes killed , is it ? 
  or are you just bolstering your strawman ? 
   did rhodes kill as many people as hitler ? 
  did he kill large numbers of people ? 
  yes . 
  ** should people who kill large numbers of other people for vile reasons be honored ? 
  ** i agree with you there . 
  and leaving a historical statue is n't honoring him . 
  yours is pretty good too , setting up rhodes as being bad on the same scale as hitler , makes him a much nicer target . 
  til cecil rhodes gassed 6 million africans . 
   i mean , i 'm sorry for reaching the godwin point so quick but would you say the lack of `` adolf-hitler-platz '' and `` hitler scholarship funds '' amount to erasing hitler from history ? 
  which is why invoking hitler like this contributes nothing to the discussion . 
  how can you compare the two men on equal footing ? 
   frankly , it will likely be the latter . 
  well at least until civil unrest ca n't be ignored any longer . 
  at least from the outside it looks like the attitude of germans has shifted quite a lot since nye , whereas one year ago it would be impossible to raise the same type of conversation without being frowned upon . 
  give it another year of this madness and i very much doubt that criminal asylum seekers will be able to commit these crimes with such impunity . 
   no it is not but changing the geneva convention is not easy     what about women being sexually abused ? 
  they count less than people who have asylum sexually abusing them ? 
      uhm no , but that doesnt void that you can not dpeport people to territory where they are in danger of being killed or tortured you 've made a great case for tightening the asylum process as much as possible and making it much harder to qualify for asylum . 
  while you have a point , you ca n't deny that women and children are the most at-risk groups amongst refugees . 
  imho these should get priority . 
  i heard of no migrant women sexually assaulting and robbing people during nye , which means that the men from these social backgrounds are clearly a greater security risk . 
  there is no perfect solution , and we must help those we can help , but without setting ourselves on fire in the process . 
  i agree with you there , however a policy such as the canadian one would have a big impact in the short term and would address the dire situation that has to be solved right now . 
   meanwhile a couple of steps east you have war raging in ukraine leaving people just as miserable , and nobody seems to give a shit anymore , the 15 minutes of fame are gone . 
  this really gets to me , its not like there is n't also a war going on in europe . 
   generally , the opinions that i hear largely from the older generation here , is that they feel it is unfair not to prioritize helping other europeans with which we share a lot more both culturally and historically . 
  and i never understand why this is that war refugees from further away are given priority . 
  almost like the ukranians are less human because they 're more similar to us . 
  and for all the talk about how the me migrants are engineers and high-educated people , often being false , this is often actually true with eastern-europeans . 
  the communist bloc , for all its flaws , did n't skimp on education and there are tons of qualified people in eastern-europe that my country has benefited from . 
  seeing that the `` war refugees '' from the middle east [ feel above coming to my country ] ( http://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/embaixador-de-portugal-fez-operacao-de-charme-junto-de-refugiados-na-grecia-4904545.html ) , i 'm fine with giving their places to ukranians escaping the strife in their country . 
  i wish we adopted one more like yours : only take women , children and family units , no lone males , and only from countries actually at war . 
  alas , it does n't seem like this will happen in the near future :(, 
  well the paper slip you get from the atm is the document you present when asked for your license so , yeah . 
  maybe it 's not the correct word , but it 's what we call it here . 
  the problems you are posing i think are also largely derived from how far the host country is willing to bend over for the migrants . 
  in my country we have a very take-it-or-leave-it approach to immigration , so if you do n't like it here you 're free to go elsewhere to make your way in life , bitching and moaning wo n't get you far . 
  there 's little pandering to sensitivities or enabling of anti-social behaviour . 
  edit : reading your post in a certain light , it 's almost a good proposition for denying muslim migrants . 
  their `` cost-benefit '' ratio regarding integration/assimilation is far too high when compared to immigrants from other backgrounds . 
  why should we have to deal with muslim-specific grievances when we can take eastern-europeans that actually appreciate us ? 
   the isis narrative has been planted on fertile soil : it is allowed to flourish because of islamophobia , socio-economic deprivation , intrusive british foreign policy and , of course , the politicisation of islam by a power-hungry terrorist organisation . 
  he fails to explain why so many other people who live in poverty do n't turn to radical ideology nearly as much as muslims . 
  hell , my country took in tens of thousands of dirt-poor eastern-european migrants over the last 20 years and we 've barely noticed any problems , they 've assimilated well into the country despite all the hardships . 
  what is the proposed solution here ? 
  shower all muslims with money so that they do n't turn into terrorists ? 
   wait you need a license to fish ? 
  yes . 
  in my country you can very conveniently buy your hunting or fishing licence at an atm , any day of the week . 
  yay !, 
   however - and this is perhaps more important - i do n't think this is simply a policing issue .
