  ultimately , this has to be addressed by policy . 
  i think it 's more than fair to argue that european countries ca n't sustain this sort of asymmetrical immigration ad infinitum . 
  exactly , it 's a large enough problem as it is without another year of the same or larger influx of migrants . 
  the problems will only grow if nothing is done to change policy . 
   that was until we saw the temperatures there during summertime , oof . 
  haha !, 
  yeah , our summers are hot , but we always have cold beer on hand to help cool off  as long as you stay away from amareleja ( has the country record of [ 50c during the summer ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/amareleja/vila-alentejana-bate-recorde-e-chega-aos-50-graus ) ) , you wo n't encounter life-threatening temperatures !, 
  the sintra trails you 'll probably enjoy more than the rota vicentina if the heat is not for you , since it has a sort of microclimate separate from the rest of the country ( near the ocean , with a forest ) . 
  i 've done the small trail to the [ palacio da pena ] ( http://www.parquesdesintra.pt/parques-jardins-e-monumentos/parque-e-palacio-nacional-da-pena/ ) by going part-way with the car and cheating ... :p, 
  in my country you might have luck at the estrela mountain range for harder hiking : http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/portugal/beira-alta-beira-baixa/serra-da-estrela/hiking-parque-natural/ also , google for hiking in the minho and tras-os-montes regions where we also have natural reservations and hiking trails there that are popular amongst nationals . 
   edit : just remembered about sintra , it also has hiking trails and a gorgeous natural reservation and historical monuments to boot : http://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/recreation-and-leisure/hiking-trails/ if you take the castelo dos mouros route , you 'll see one of our oldest fortresses at the peak , the mouros castle which stands since the time of the reconquista, 
   the issue is also that thousands of people gathering on the streets of a major city like cologne would be a big anomaly most times but on nye it is basically expected this is a good point , i agree . 
   trying to compared these two events is irrational beyond belief . 
  i agree with you in part , they are n't entirely comparable , i should have stated it differently : the police have shown they are capable of cracking down on this type of crowd , so i hope they do the same thing if that same type of rapist crowd tries to gather in future . 
  with regard to prior warning , i do n't know how riot police works in germany ; however in my country , if a large unruly crowd is reported our riot police ( corpo de interven\u00e7\u00e3o ) show up really quickly and start cracking skulls . 
  regardless of prior warning i doubt the same crowd of attackers from cologne would have gotten away with such impunity had they tried the same thing in [ terreiro do pa\u00e7o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pra%c3%a7a_do_com%c3%a9rcio ) . 
   portugal improved a lot on women 's rights and treatment since 1974 definitely . 
  many in the older generations still felt it was okay to hit their wife ; on a job i had previously i saw an old man ask to speak to a guy because he was sure a woman would n't know how to help him . 
  the difference is that our society does n't reinforce this behaviour , and even those people slowly change and soften with time ; maybe they do n't become as `` progressive '' as the younger generations , but our society is n't stuck and fighting for the `` old ways '' . 
  hell we even have gay marriage and adoption by gay couples before germany !, 
  the difference is that this time the police were prepared . 
  other posters here have pointed out that the city 's police had rejected reinforcements for nye . 
   or undercover police acting as agent provocateurs . 
  this i very much doubt . 
  it 's as ridiculous as those claiming that the nye harassers were actually right-wingers trying to stir up hatred against the migrants . 
  since they turned violent , they got the treatment they deserved from the police . 
  that said , i hope the german police take a similar hard stance the next time a crowd of rapists gathers ; the way they responded on nye was disgraceful . 
   the common point is very lowly educated people . 
  a large part of our population is completely uneducated and not is properly used to living in urban areas . 
  no i ca n't agree entirely with this . 
  the common point is the culture ( very backward regarding women ) and religion which reinforces these attitudes and impedes change . 
  my country also had very lowly educated populace until the revolution in '74 ( where people signed documents with their thumbprint since they had no schooling at all ) yet these type of mass sexual assaults were unheard of . 
  i agree on one hand that education does play a role , but its far from being the sole reason . 
   then you 'll have five years to enjoy yourself before your nervous system is harvested for use in the robotics industry . 
  eh ... if i 'm dead i wo n't care either way . 
  my liver wo n't be of much use to them though :(, 
  thanks for that info !, 
  interesting point . 
  the age of death may rise but what about the difference in quality of life in those later years , are they comparable ? 
  i 'm not even counting on ever receiving mine . 
  wonder how many turns it will take to build with their current resources . 
   i say , just let them go , really . 
  if the brits want to leave , let them . 
  if they eventually learn that it was n't such a great idea they can hold the politicians responsible who played with that contant threat of leaving . 
  you seem to be forgetting that the uk is a net contributor to the eu . 
  greater will be the union 's loss , not the other way around . 
   barbara steffens , ** equality minister ** in north rhine-westphalia til that such a thing exists in germany . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
   so they 're going to make smoking cigarettes illegal ? 
  which means that the tobacco market will become an underground one , and with that all the unpleasantness that crime brings with it . 
  why do people keep repeating the mistake of prohibition over and over again ? 
   but to me it seems a long way still until refugees actually make up a majority of the population . 
  in london ethnic brits are already a minority since at least 2012 ( date on the article ) : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4bd95562-4379-11e2-a48c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3wem2dblh i do n't imagine this will happen * everywhere * , but it 's not valid to claim that it wo n't happen at all , or that it 's far away in the distant future , since it has already happened . 
  edit : the automoderator sent me a message saying that ft articles are paywalled , however the one i posted above is n't . 
  in any case , the relevant snippet from the article :  the surge of immigration has been especially striking in london , where more than one in three people -- 37 per cent -- were born outside the uk . 
   only 45 per cent of london 's population were white people of english , scottish or welsh heritage , according to the latest data , down from almost 60 per cent in 2001 . 
   this makes london the first uk region where white ethnic britons have become a minority . 
   snitches get stitches . 
  perhaps if you live in cova da moura or other similar neighbourhoods , otherwise not really . 
  jonas salk is spinning in his grave right now :(, 
  a very large portion of those are yet to be determined as refugees , and those that are n't will be doing what until then ? 
  and will they go peacefully back to their countries if asylum is rejected ? 
  the cost is n't paid only in money . 
  you ca n't buy guaranteed successful integration , and the larger the number of migrants the less likely they will assimilate . 
  they 're pretty popular here . 
   our representatives say we should use jesus to prevent teen pregnancies . 
  i thought conservative christians were against homosexuality . 
  you seem to think that the shit-hole that syria has turned into is completely divorced from the invasion of iraq ? 
  ignorant . 
  and if you 're still claiming `` vague bullshit '' you did n't even watch the video where cheney himself accurately describes what would happen to the region if sadam were deposed , almost 10 years before the invasion . 
  anyway , i 've had a look at the subreddits you moderate and your comments its obvious you 're either a troll or a pitty-seeker who thinks america is the poor blameless victim in this whole mess . 
  the war you started has larger ramifications than only iraq . 
  again , the bush administration knew this well before the invasion . 
  i assume he was asking the question since they 're being called refugees after they passed through multiple safe countries before reaching sweden . 
   starman is pole who went to space . 
  everyone knows polan ca n't into space, 
  thanks !, 
  obviously you 're exagerating , but the bush administration knew they 'd turn the region into a fire-pit and what the consequences would be . 
  before you start with the claims that you had no idea this would happen , your country * did know * exactly what would happen as you can see in this 1994 interview with cheney : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9yud9kyk9i pretty much describes what the region has devolved into . 
  your country is n't directly responsible for all the death and destruction in iraq and syria , but you are n't blameless either . 
  now that i come to think about this , we do n't have all that many jokes about spain ... at least not that i can remember . 
  though i do relish teasing folk from border cities like elvas by calling them spaniards  the joke i do know is : ------- a spanish guy , a portuguese guy , an old lady and a hot blonde are traveling in the same train car and they 're seated next to each other . 
  the train enters a tunnel and suddenly a * slap * rings out , and when the train exits the tunnel the spaniard has a red palm mark on his cheek . 
  - the blonde girl thinks : `` hah , the spanish guy probably tried to grope me but grabbed the old lady in the dark instead , and got slapped . '', 
  - the old lady thinks : `` the spanish guy probably tried to grope the blonde and got slapped . '', 
  - the spaniard thinks : `` that damn portuguese guy groped the blonde and she thought it was me ! '', 
  - the portuguse thinks : `` ca n't wait for the next tunnel so i can slap the spaniard again ! '', 
   spain is there , thus portugal is there . 
  ** eye twitches ... starts foaming at the mouth **, 
  dunno about you guys , but since we 've only had freedom of expression since '74 these topics are a non-issue in my country , at least from what i can tell . 
  perhaps its because we 've had this freedom for less time than lots of other countries , who knows ? 
  lots of people who lived under the old regime are still alive now and remind us how much worse it was . 
   we do have some cash but how would you think of being paid directly in pork and beer ? 
  might save us both some taxes , eh  excellent !, 
  this sounds like the kind of thing to discuss over a long meal of pork and beer !, 
  if you want a mountain so bad we can sell you one . 
  how about the peak of the [ ossa mountain range ] ( http://www.visitalentejo.pt/pt/o-alentejo/viva/serra-d-ossa/ ) in our flattest province ? 
  wow , 650 meters !, 
  such height !, 
  very mountain !,
