  other countries can be gendered , like france ( a fran\u00e7a ) or mexico ( o m\u00e9xico ) , or even plural like the united states ( os estados unidos ) . 
  they also make great drinking buddies !, 
  we cater to everyone 's tastes , they 're welcome to eat alheira or farinheira !,

   i 'm just kidding !, 
  besides , as far as troubling legacies go the reconquista is n't nearly as bad as the colonisation of america ( including the uk in this , too ) well i would n't exactly call it troubling at all . 
  it 's called a `` re-conquest '' for a reason : most of our major cities were originally founded by the roman empire and conquered by the umayyad caliphate . 
  we were under the boot of an islamic caliphate and fought to liberate ourselves from it . 
  throw in a dash of holy war as well unfortunately ... everything was done in the name of god at the time :( edit : sorry if this came off as aggressive or `` preachy '' , i was having a mild bout of `` portugal stronk !, 
   haha , wow evora should really let it go already why ? 
  that has been the city 's coat of arms since it was taken during the reconquista . 
  why should we abandon a piece of our history ? 
  edit : in case you 're curious as to why that is the city 's coat of arms , read up on [ giraldo sem pavor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_the_fearless ) , one of our folk heros . 
  you make a very valid observation . 
  overall we are also a very welcoming and hospitable people . 
  as long as they make an effort to learn the language and obey our laws , we 'll get along just fine . 
   in my country there 's a saying : `` you do n't look to the teeth of a horse that was given to you '' [ rough translation ] . 
  this just shows that if they ca n't get in into the richer european countries , they would rather return to turkey or other middle eastern countries than to come to poorer eu countries . 
  exactly . 
  the 50 that accepted i 'd see as really being refugees , and imho they are welcome to stay until the war is over . 
  as for the rest , well at this point they 're welfare shopping . 
  wo n't this actually help the uk regarding exports ? 
  if you 're talking about expresso 's magazine called `` revista e '' , there is no 12th of dec. 2015 publication . 
  there is an 11th of dec. publication : http://expresso.sapo.pt/capas/2015-12-11-para-la-do-bem-e-do-mal-na-revista-e it is though very convenient that this source of yours is n't readily available for consultation online , but no worries , i 'll try to get my hands on a hard-copy . 
  lastly even if what you say has any truth to it , you 're very disingenuous to suggest that europeans would rather starve than do manual labour , and in the alentejo of all places !, 
  if you really are portuguese you know perfectly well how hard life has been for alentejanos in the past , and the backbreaking work people had ( and still have ) to do just to scrape by . 
  have a great day , mr. english-german-portuguese redditor . 
   in my village in the south of portugal , one of the poorest regions of the eurozone , we have thousands of pakistanis , thais , indians , etc. 
  for doing the farm work . 
  europeans do n't want to do physical labor . 
  they would rather starve to death . 
  loool . 
  what a blatant lie . 
  i 'd love to know which village this is , because a very large percentage of villages in the alentejo are losing their young population entirely to the bigger cities , leaving only the old there . 
  if what this troll said was actually true , then his `` village '' would probably be populated mostly by the foreigners he mentioned , which is something entirely unheard of . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  ps : oh and by the way / u/new-atlantis , indian and pakistani immigrants in portugal always prefer the large metropolitan areas , which is where they tend to set up convenience stores and eateries . 
  i lived in rural alentejo for almost 20 years and never saw an indian or pakistani toiling in the fields or working construction . 
  plenty of ukrainians , romanians and other ee migrants doing hard physical labour though , but i guess this does n't fit in with your narrative that europeans wo n't do hard labour !, 
  we 'd be unstoppable . 
  the empire of portugal & oliven\u00e7a ... 
  i think you meant to reply to the parent comment , 
  thanks for the info !, 
  you really have no sense of humor ... he was joking and so was i. 
  ca n't let the anti-brexit circlejerk die !, 
  jeez take it easy man , the guy was obviously joking . 
  either way , our plan to annex galiza is far more subtle , and nobody will ever see it coming , 
  erm what ? 
   i have vodka * ( vodka causes my body to regenerate , begin breathing ) * ... open my mouth to speak but a strange language comes out : ** cyka blyat !,

  nooooooooooooo !, 
   i 'll call to 112 :d too late , on my way to the morgue . 
   spaniards ( * blood boils , head explodes * ), 
  heresy !, 
  you must be fun at parties ... 
  but why the fuck would you post that here ? 
  it looked like someone 's skin had been peeled from their face from the neck up ... and it did n't look staged ... 
  jesus h christ what the fuck, 
  and this changes the situation how ? 
  if second and third generation immigrants are still having a problem integrating into society , you 're not exactly doing them a favour by pointing out that they were born here . 
  if anything it 's even worse , they have no excuse for their behaviour . 
  well done romania-bros , keep up the good work , 
  here in portugal we eagerly await the disintegration of spain . 
  do n't worry , we 'll take good care of galiza , 
  well at least [ king 's landing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dubrovnik ) is still yours . 
  better get your money 's worth while the series is still running :p, 
  what begins ? 
  still salty about your defeat at the hands of lord darth v'eder , i see ... 
  maybe they 'll be lucky to experience the [ ver\u00e3o de s. martinho ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ver%c3%a3o_de_s%c3%a3o_martinho ) , 
   it means that those cases where they overlap in a contradictory way they side with islam . 
  which is very concerning , considering that europe in general has been trending toward a more progressive society which is ever more incompatible with islam . 
   ~ ~ headscarves ~ ~ balaclavas a barrier to german job market . 
   ehh , dunno what percentage of christians do . 
  christians in the west complain and whine about certain things , but outright rejection of secular laws is n't something * 30 % * of them do . 
  if this were the case , then my country that still is majority catholic would never have been able to pass into law the right to abortion , gay marriage , adoption by gay couples and the decriminalization of drugs . 
  islamic conservatives are far more rigid than christian conservatives . 
  christianity has been gutted of much of its political power in europe , islam has n't . 
   just 30 % reject a core foundation of their host country  just yeah , and people wonder why there 's opposition to allowing the islamic demographic to increase . 
   ps.according to the new oecd ranking poland is currently the safest country in europe and 2nd safest country in the world after japan but according to this sub , immigrants in poland are being beaten to death on a regular basis and treated like the spawn of the devil . 
  does n't matter what official sources say ( ocde ? 
  pff , probably some alt-right shill organization ) , if the guardian or ft or other left-leaning media say poland is the 4th reich then everyone believes and loses their minds . 
  you keep harping on that polish society is `` weak '' , but weakness appears to be a characteristic of many western european nations that have been too spineless over the last few decades to make sure that immigrants from these incompatible cultures properly assimilate into our societies . 
  meanwhile france is too * weak * to deal with a camp of illegal immigrants in calais , and has festering pockets of hardliner muslims in many of its major cities thanks to a laissez-faire attitude towards immigration . 
  seems to me poland does n't want to follow in making the same mistakes other countries made . 
  well [ according to / u/ronblue23 's logic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52aer1/hundreds_of_thousands_rally_in_catalan_in_order/d7ionkn ) , assad 's government should have just bent over and handed the country to the salafists without incident . 
  what a retarded comparison . 
  everyone seems to be focusing on the negative aspects of this . 
  but now criminals can play irl pacman !, 
  i guess we will resume our ancient role as [ kebap removers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_the_fearless ) once again * sigh *, 
  these are tactical burkas . 
  nothing to do with islam of course . 
  yes . 
  in this case i do n't think that averages do much justice . 
  perhaps median temperatures would be better . 
  rome 's plans for carthage were a little more hitlary than that !, 
  this is my country 's communist party in a nutshell . 
  edit : for the downvoters , in my country in the last election the center-left ps made a coalition with the pcp ( communists ) and the be ( new left / alt-left ) . 
  one of the usual populist lines they ( pcp/be ) used to tout when they were only opposition parties was the increase of the retirement payouts . 
  but when they came to government , reality hit them in the face and they only managed to increase it by a handful of euros ( when then promised large increses ) . 
  they scream from the rooftops how this was some sort of victory but it was a slap in the face for their voters , who can now see that their promises were just hot air .
