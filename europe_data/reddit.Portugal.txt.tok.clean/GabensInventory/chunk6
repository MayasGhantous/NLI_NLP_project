  you can claim utopia and equality for all but if the resources do n't exist to implement this then you 're going to have a bad time . 
  populism is n't just a right-wing thing , it exist very much on the left as well . 
  which makes perfect sense , considering we even have the popular saying `` pontualidade britanica '' to describe unusually punctual individuals . 
  outside of professional settings punctuality does n't really exist here , 
   did you hear the story about how the eu had to force the uk government to give wales the money the eu allocated to wales in development funds ? 
  for several years the uk government was not giving that money to the welsh government and it was just going straight into the treasury . 
  i did n't know this , which is why i was asking . 
  thanks for the info . 
  considering that the uk is a net contributor to the eu 's coffers , is this headline really as bad as it seems ? 
  would n't the uk on it 's own be able to fill in the gaps that the eu covered before ? 
  have a pint and a side of crispy bacon . 
   where are all the right wingers telling us about freeze peach now ? 
  recruiting people to fight for isil does n't fall under `` freeze peach '' ( wtf childish term is that anyway ? ) . 
  it 's treason . 
  perhaps you 'd like to enlighten us why this islamofascist should get a pass ? 
  while our word for knife is `` faca '' , `` cultelo '' is the word we use for a butcher 's cleaver ... so it 's not very far off from the rest of southern europe . 
  finally this islamofascist gets a small taste of justice . 
   how can people be extreme anarchist and go around with the latest iphone daddy bought them ? 
  armchair revolutionaries . 
   what do you mean ` actually do ' ? 
  what is the plan of action if you do break off from the uk ? 
  do you create your own currency or do you adopt the euro ? 
  and if you do choose the euro , what currency do you use during the time you 're negotiating your eu membership ? 
  how do you address the budget deficit as a country on your own ? 
  stuff like this . 
  or are your post-uk-exit plans as vacuous as the brexit ones ? 
  o7 o7 o7, 
  honest question here : i 've seen the mockery on this sub of the pro-brexit users , but the arguments put forward by those who want scottish independence seems quite similar to the pro-brexit rhetoric . 
  what will scotland actually do if it does leave the uk ? 
  it seems from the outside that you stand to lose far more than you gain .

   wow , did nobody actually brief him on who he was dealing with ? 
  probably forgot he was n't in the us . 
  despite our own problems with corporations , the eu commission does have a good track-record for not letting megacorps trample them . 
   all face coverings should be banned in public , not just those associated with muslims . 
  this is already the case in many eu countries , mine included . 
  march into a bank or supermarket with a motorcycle helmet still on your head and you 're in for a bad time ... do n't know why these islamic ninja-suits should be given an exception though , perhaps you can explain ? 
  i do n't have to come up with anything , just have to wait for you to open your mouth and see the shit pouring out , as usual . 
   i would prefer not to see assault weapons in the hands of people who tend to go on diatribes about `` heritage '' , `` national identity '' and `` sovereignty '' . 
  bad experience with that , you know . 
  yet i bet you 're perfectly fine with mena folks going on diatribes that defend their cultural identity , given past posts of yours . 
  i 'm beginning to think you 're either a troll or just an extremely naive leftist basement-dweller . 
  seems we have reached the point that smiley shitposts are in order . 
  either way , i 'm willing to talk more with you via pm if you want . 
  on reddit or other forums its easy to enter the us-vs-them mentality , so if you want to discuss topics more personally and away from the public feel free to message me . 
  cheers , ` murican , 
   `` it was just a joke brah '', 
  and here you lost the plot completely . 
  your american democracy is anything but . 
  continue pretending you 're a democracy with a two-party system , meanwhile in my countries previously small parties like the bloco de esquerda ( that i voted for ) can rise from nothing to be political force . 
  you are n't in a real democracy any more , american . 
  you currently have the option to vote on a fascist blowhard that wants to build a wall on the mexican border , or to vote on a corrupt-to-the bones corporate puppet that pretends to be a liberal . 
  good luck , 
   btw i hate anyone not following american culture . 
  america rules the world in terms of culture and progressiveness . 
  do n't anyone dare progress more than us, 
   have i mentioned how i love pretending my american culture is superior to that of foreign countries ? 
  btw i 'm uber regressive, 
   something something ` murica something something imperialism something something islam is the future, 
  you have nothing to say but tired retarded memes ? 
  not surprising . 
  edit : oops , should i have said `` differently abled '' memes ? 
  i hope i did n't wound your fragile american ego . 
  yes american , my country is more progressive than yours . 
  deal with it . 
  we have in law the right to abortion , gay marriage and adoption by gay couples , and decriminalization of drugs . 
  let me know when your country comes anywhere close . 
  lol , typical from an impotent american fringe-left to claim that . 
  the fact is that european countries have far surpassed yours when it comes to progressiveness , yet we have n't fallen into the political correctness shithole that you have . 
  they will shut down all their mcdonald 's and kfc 's in europe !, 
  what ever will we do ?!, 
  i 'm sure local eateries will be devastated if the us does that !, 
   srs poster perpetually enraged legbeard . 
  if you 're wondering about downvotes , it seems you 've triggered the perpetually-outraged shit-for-brains basement dwellers over at / r/shitredditsays, 
  lol , i like that fact you 're still getting downvoted after showing how wrong that claim is . 
  that 's reddit for you . 
  i agree with you in principle , but what the current laws allow is politicians that do favours to corporations/banks that will them give them high-paying jobs later on when they leave public service . 
  it 's not a problem with an easy and straightforward solution . 
  ps : have an upvote , as usual the downvote button is being used as a disagree button ... 
  as others have already mentioned , it means that we legally acquired the necessary information and tech to produce an identical version of the rifle that h&k themselves would produce . 
  this is not uncommon when governments want to ensure that they can guarantee that weapon production remains under their control , but without pissing off their allies . 
  edit : a counter-point to this would be for example the unlicensed versions of the ak47 produced by china ( type 56 ) several decades ago . 
  to be fair , afaik his time there was not too long , then he flipped to the center-right psd . 
  after getting elected prime minister ( as the psd leader ) , he left us hanging for the eu post in the middle of his term . 
  this guy 's career has been purely focused on climbing the ladder as fast as possible . 
  if anyone wonders why you call him a maoist , he used to be in the mrpp , a hard-liner communist party in my country . 
  edit : this was at the start of his political career , before flipping to the center-right psd . 
   nothing wrong with that , g3 is an excellent weapon system . 
  agreed , it was n't meant as a negative comment . 
  by all accounts it 's an extremely reliable weapon , and served our troops well during the colonial wars . 
  given that we have more pressing financial issues , replacing it seems to me to be an unnecessary luxury . 
  we 're still using the trusty old g3 ( under license ) , and probably will be until the heat-death of the universe . 
  edit : not sure why you 're being downvoted , your comment was obviously made as a jest . 
  found the salafist !, 
   what about \u021aigani or cig\u00e1ny ? 
  huh , quite similar to the portuguese : ciganos ( m , plural ), 
  hmm , the whales look like a dr. who reference . 
  the antifa folks will probably be fine .
