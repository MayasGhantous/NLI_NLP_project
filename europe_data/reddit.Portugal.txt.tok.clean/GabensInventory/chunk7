   that type of history tends to create an atmosphere that makes proper integration near impossible . 
  not impossible , they just do n't want to integrate . 
  even in my country that does n't have the same welfare capabilities that northern europe has , we give them plenty of benefits , more than ethnic portuguese get . 
  yet they still shit on all this help , keep their kids out of school , wreck the homes we give them , marry their daughters off under age and generally do nothing to be a productive part of society . 
  these prejudices are n't born in a vacuum , it 's not only us that has to make an effort to help them , ** they ** have to do their part . 
   so i give them casual levels of respect . 
  yes , silly you . 
  take a stroll through one of our gypsy ( `` cigano '' ) neighbourhoods at 1 am , then come back and let me know how you feel . 
  these types of stereotypes do n't appear out of thin air . 
  same here . 
  they get plenty of benefits for being an ethnic minority yet still manage to bite the hand that feeds them , and turn the neighbourhoods that they live in into shit . 
  the nomadic ones cause even more problems in other ways , squatting , destroying property , trying to live by their own barbaric `` laws '' , etc. 
  in the border regions with spain it 's also not uncommon to see them hopping back and forth between our two countries to collect welfare from both . 
  this is nowhere near a solved problem ; they simply do not want to integrate . 
   it 's typical for leftists to claim `` higher education '' in order to dismiss other stances as uninformed ignorant plebs who we should n't listen to . 
  without mentioning what this `` higher education '' is , curiously . 
  liberal arts majors thinking their opinions are above everyone else 's is n't anything new . 
  have your parents pay for a 3-year course with dead-end job market prospects , attend your local communist/green party 's youth rallies . 
  you 're now a member of society with `` higher '' education and you 're all set to dismissing the concerns of the unwashed working class plebeians !, 
  yeah , we saw this happen in my country last year already : http://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/embaixador-de-portugal-fez-operacao-de-charme-junto-de-refugiados-na-grecia-4904545.html at the hight of the crisis we volunteered to take in 5000 refugees from greece and only ** 50 ** accepted . 
  those 50 i see as real refugees . 
  the remainder who slapped away a helping hand are welfare-seekers and economic migrants . 
  seeing this happen again now is not surprising at all . 
  you can often find pretty bizarre stuff if you open the opinion section . 
  but i guess that would be true for almost any outlet . 
  pretty much . 
  we do n't have the same welfare/social capabilities that countries in northern europe have , but we 're a stable democracy and have universal healthcare and decent education , especially compared to where these refugees are coming from it 's a big increase in quality of life and safety . 
  i guess it 's actually a good thing that we 're not so well-sought as germany or sweden , it helps separate the real asylum seekers from the pretenders . 
   you know that hungary was also the first country to say `` fuck the dublin treaty '' and let them all go to germany ? 
  that would be greece . 
  hungary is actually making an effort to enforce the dublin treaty . 
  so half sweedish green then . 
  he wants unlimited immigrants ? 
   ** they are rejected on the basis of them arriving from serbia , a country that is considered safe ** and they send them back there . 
  this is why decisions can be made in hours instead of months . 
  so ... they 're following eu regulations then ? 
  is there any indication of why they were rejected ? 
  lack of resources to properly validate the claims ? 
  perhaps the claimants ca n't actually have their stories properly validated ? 
  either way this seems more a result of there not being a coordinated effort from the eu to do this rather than a failure of your country alone . 
   what statistics ? 
  the fence went up in late september . 
  it seems you 're in the top 5 of asylum seeker registrations , if that source is to be believed ( being an official eu source , not sure why you would n't ) . 
  still , perhaps seeing the statistics for 2016 would be more accurate as you say . 
  i ca n't find any data more current than this at the moment . 
   when it was set up , a daily cap for applications was set at 100 and it went progressively lower , now it 's at 20 . 
  it 's quite clear that this administrative bottleneck is entirely artificial and has little to do with the migration agency being stretched to its conceivable limits . 
  interesting , though this does n't seem to fit the reported statistics of the number of asylum seekers registered by your country last year , here : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics, 
   bitch please we outright ignored that there were any until they literally showed up on our doorstep . 
  really ? 
  perhaps you 'd like to explain this then ? 
  last year my country offered to take in 5000 refugees during the peak of the crisis and only ** 50 ** accepted : http://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/embaixador-de-portugal-fez-operacao-de-charme-junto-de-refugiados-na-grecia-4904545.html the 50 that accepted are welcome to stay until the war is over imho ; the remainder are welfare seekers and economic migrants , not refugees . 
  if they were refugees then they 'd register for asylum in an orderly manner , which is what hungary is trying to do . 
  those who do n't comply are n't allowed entrance , obviously . 
  forcing the migrants / `` refugees '' to register per eu regulations is fascism now , is it ? 
  they do n't turn people away , they merely require them to register their asylum process at designated checkpoints . 
  it 's not their fault that a large portion of these people do n't even want to be identified it seems . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but your country does n't have this fence to keep them * out * , but too force them to register as per eu regulations . 
  this is much better than simply letting them steamroll over you and into germany/austria . 
  still remember one of your mps ( greens ? ), 
  crying on camera after this . 
  thankfully this person is n't in charge of larger policy or you 'd be more fucked . 
  not to mention the massive increase in the yields since the first nukes were dropped on japan . 
  i doubt hiroshima and nagasaki would have recovered as fast if they were hit with warheads in the tens-of-megatons range . 
  i agree with you , to a certain point . 
  or course not all peace movements were soviet puppets , but it appears to be quite plausible that their efforts at influencing people and organizations that could spread their ideology did have quite some effect . 
  i take what the man says with a table-spoon of salt , though it is n't honest either to ignore the correlation of current social movements with the subversive plans he describes . 
  i especially find it no coincidence that there 's a large overlap between current `` social justice '' movements and marxism/anti-capitalism . 
  the people in these movements have abundant access to information that shows what life was like in communist countries , yet still seem to defend it tooth and nail ( which he describes quite accurately too , here : https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4?t=4116 ) . 
   you would think we have learned by now the soviet union fell but the shit they did is probably still having repercussions . 
  [ see for example yuri bezmenov ] ( https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4?t=3432 ) ( a kgb defector ) : the stuff he described regarding the long-term effects of slowly brainwashing a population by infiltrating academia , the press , and influencing celebrities , is uncanny given what we see unfolding nowadays . 
  even if this were true , what on earth has this got to do with being `` brown '' ? 
   but you do n't seem to understand ... turks are brown , so none of what you said matters . 
  already playing the race card , how surprising . 
  no i did n't live through it , though there are still plenty alive that did . 
  proudly one of the most bloodless coups in history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution * you * were the one that suggested that a coup would inevitably end in a military junta ruling the country , and i gave you a counter example . 
  but i can understand why you think this , you assume the rest of european countries are as savage and barbaric as yours . 
  you mean like my country 's military coup in ' 74 ? 
  oh wait , the military deposed the fascist regime and then handed power back to the people , and we now live in a democracy . 
  sure , sex-ed is important , even before 12 . 
  thinking that 12-year-olds can make good decisions regarding sexual partners is naive . 
  they 're basically kids . 
  14 year-olds ? 
  year , maybe ( big maybe ) , 2 years of puberty make lots of changes , but i see no logic in removing child abuse protections for 12 year olds . 
  edit : and the concern here is n't only for other teenagers as in your example , but for adults who prey on children . 
  it appears this will make the penalties lesser for these types of criminals . 
   however , cases where the person is older than 12 will no longer be considered child abuse , which carries very stiff penalty . 
  i know that , and again this is n't a good thing . 
  fucking 12 , really ? 
  does n't matter if it 's male or female . 
  the fact that this allows a fucking child to `` consent '' is n't acceptable . 
  go on though . 
  keep pretending this is n't the case . 
  you can also keep pretending you 're living in a democracy . 
   the age of consent remains at 18 in turkey which means absolutely nothing if a judge can decide that a 12 year old `` consented '' to sex . 
  seriously , how is it even in despute that a fucking 12 year old child can consent ? 
  so it 's now a he-said she-said game ? 
  how wonderful !, 
  i 'm sure some 12 year old girl who got raped will totally get appropriate justice ( for child abuse ) once her accuser pulls out the excuse `` yeah , she said she was 20 !, 
  i mean look at her , she totally looked 20 to me '' .
