  fuck off , another rape apologist found . 
  not that unexpected , considering you 're a muslim . 
  edit : also not surprising that the evil western countries you named do n't seem to allow raping 12-year olds and calling it consent . 
  `` they '' ? 
  which western country allows 12 years old girls to `` consent '' to sex ? 
  even if there is one , this is n't a good thing , nor is it something to emulate . 
  but carry on , turk stronk !, 
  afaik rapes usually leave distinctive lesions that doctors can identify , not to mention being raped by 9 fucking guys ... 
  but perhaps you 're like the top-level comment , she totally fucked 9 guys consensually then forgot about it . 
   after reading the article : how do we even know it was rape ? 
  she does n't remember anything and the men deny any wrongdoing . 
  at least from the information in the article we ca n't draw any conclusion . 
  yeah , she totally invited 9 guys to run a train through her and then forgot about it . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  how many of these `` trashy '' girls were 12 when they started having these relationships ? 
  edit : ok , just downvote instead of giving an actual answer . 
  the fact that you do n't answer is enough already , thanks . 
  probably a country that would provide better fiscal benefits and assure better profits than if they remained in scotland . 
  eg : one of the largest portuguese multinationals ( grupo jeronimo martins ) moved its fiscal headquarters to the netherlands for precisely this reason ( and it 's something that caused quite some controversy here at the time ) . 
  these entities have one main objective : make more money . 
  whatever helps them optimize this goal is what will happen . 
  perhaps as a bank , the rbs ' reasons will be slightly different from the example i gave , but not very far off . 
   so you ca n't give consent if you are younger than 18 but you are still expected to make a decision ? 
  what ? 
  and that 's the crux , is n't it ? 
  officially the age of consent remains at 18 but now girls 12 years old and up can `` consent '' . 
  yet the majority here thinks this is n't child abuse ... 
  i guess the independent-scotland and anti-brexit crowd ca n't circlejerk over this article . 
  if you actually wanted to be honest in this conversatiuon you 'd have made the comparison between your 17 year old german and a 12 year old turkish girl , since this is what the ruling would allow . 
  in what world is a lying ** 12-year-old ** mistaken for an adult or a young adult ? 
  what ** 12-year-old ** can consent to sex ? 
  please enlighten me as to how this is n't child abuse . 
  it seems to me that i 've found one of the infamous rape apologists one hears about . 
  fta :  children aged 12 , 13 and 14 will no longer receive automatic protection as a minor , according to the ruling , but will be expected to offer or decline consent in sexual activity . 
   ** experts say this is a green light for sex with `` consenting '' minors as young as 12 . 
  ** facilitating sex with children is just sensationalist headlines , it seems . 
  fta :  children aged 12 , 13 and 14 will no longer receive automatic protection as a minor , according to the ruling , but will be expected to offer or decline consent in sexual activity . 
   ** experts say this is a green light for sex with `` consenting '' minors as young as 12 . 
  ** so minors under duress would no longer receive the same protection they received before . 
  and you think this is an improvement , how ? 
  yeah ... please tell me you 're not defending turkey 's lowering of the age of consent to [ * 12 years old * ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/700267/outrage-turkish-court-ruling-age-of-consent ) . 
  edit : regardless of the official age of consent remaining at 18 , it is effectively lowered to as low as 12 if these kids are expected to accept or decline sex . 
  from the link in this post :  ** children aged 12 , 13 and 14 will no longer receive automatic protection as a minor ** , according to the ruling , but will be expected to ** offer or decline consent ** in sexual activity . 
  argue semantics and be as pedantic as you want , but if you think this is n't a lowering of the age of consent then i do n't know what reality you 're living in . 
   well you seem to enjoy generalizing . 
  you think all muslims are animals who only like to smash their wooden clubs on poor defenseless women . 
  i said nothing of the sort . 
  that women in strongly islamic countries are treated beneath men is a * fact * , and the only reason they are even given liberties in our countries is that we 've divorced our state from religious institutions , and everyone is equal in the eyes of the law . 
  if the catholic church still wielded the power it had several centuries ago , as a political force , i doubt our societies would very different from those in today 's muslim world . 
  these same countries , especially saudi arabia , are funding the construction of mosques in europe that they then use as a foothold for * their * backward interpretation of islam , preached by imams that they train , and try to pass it off as being `` mainstream '' or moderate islam . 
  this is extremely dangerous and we 're not doing enough to contain it . 
  the man in the article is a salafist , and although he has to choose his words carefully , the intent of his message is very clear . 
   what do you expect me to take from that ? 
  take whatever you like from your strawmen . 
   that you 're an open minded person who educates himself on a subject before commenting on it on reddit ? 
  i know enough about islam to know that the religious side must be divorced from it 's political ideology if there is to be any progress in making it `` softer '' , the same way christianity 's influence has been eroded over time in the west . 
   i know many , many muslims personally . 
  i speak to them on a daily basis . 
  they are loving and caring people i 'm glad you do , and i 'm sure they are lovely people . 
  yet here you 're generalizing the few you know to represent all of them . 
  also polls have shown time and again that even `` moderate '' muslims still hold very backward beliefs compared to those commonly held values in western countries . 
  please tell me how many of your muslim friends are ok with abortion , gay marriage and adoption by gay couples , which are all things currently legal in my country ( which still mostly identifies as christian , by the way ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if the answer is `` none '' . 
   and they would be disgusted to hear about slavery let alone rape . 
  i do n't doubt that , but you ca n't ignore that rape of women with no consequence for the rapists goes unpunished far too often in the muslim world , sometimes so twisted that the rape victims are `` honour killed '' . 
  please do n't try to pretend that captives are any way safe from rape when ordinary muslim women can get raped and then they are killed for it . 
  edit : i still find it amusing that your go-to retort was `` racist ! '' . 
  in any case , it looks like we 'll have to agree to disagree ; we both have strong opinions on the matter and we 're not going to change each others ' minds . 
  til islam is a race . 
  when all else fails just shove your fingers in your ears and yell `` racist * racist !!! * '' . 
  i lol 'd . 
  well i guess that 's the end of your ridiculous apologetics . 
  have a good day . 
   also you are terribly na\u00efve if you think that does n't happen in western prisons ... 
  i know it does , and when it 's discovered it is punished . 
  you 're extremely naive if you think islamists will punish their brethren for raping slaves or captives . 
  it was an extremely shitty comparison to make in the first place . 
  you know perfectly well that islam 's idea of captives - as in spoils of war - is nothing like a prisoner in a jail in the west . 
  prison guards who engage in relationships with inmates are punished and can face jail time themselves , depending on the country . 
  perhaps you could try to find an even more contrived example for me to laugh at . 
  of course it 's not `` as easy as that '' . 
  i 'm not claiming it 's a solution , but it would help mitigate the problem somewhat . 
  same goes for the prison sentences for serial arsonists . 
  imho they should get the maximum penalty ( 25 years ) for destroying so many people 's lives ( and causing deaths ) , instead they get short sentences and are out in no time to start new fires again . 
   this was a discussion on a historical event . 
  you think western civilizations never had captives ? 
  of course they had , and we 're still self-flagellating ourselves over it today . 
  bible passages that promote slavery are old testament and seen as barbaric and are ignored . 
  yet this imam sees fit to show how a man who owns a slave is n't `` blameworthy '' if there 's [ no coercion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_syndrome ) . 
  or are you trying to tell me the imam firmly reminded his followers that this behaviour is `` haram '' in today 's world ? 
   in principle , should consummation take place after mutual consent and absence of coercion with a female captive oh well then , i guess if a female * captive * does n't object then it 's all fine ... oh but ... why is she even allowed to be captive in the first place ? 
  this is disgusting . 
  we have some `` firebugs '' and unfortunately a very flammable countryside . 
  unfortunately our laws are too lenient on the motherfuckers who start fires . 
  there 's also not enough legislation to enforce pre-summer cleanup of dead/dry brush by property owners ... so fires spread * extremely * quickly after they 've started , beyond the control of our firefighter who 're paid a pittance and are badly equipped . 
  it 's a clusterfuck all round . 
  we also need legislation that would force landowners to clear dead/dry brush from their land before summer . 
  lots of these fires could have been prevented or more easily contained if they just did n't spread so fast . 
  and during winter we 'll have avoidable floods because the cities did n't clear their stormdrains during the summer ... such is life here -_-, 
   i am perfectly capable of seing that isis might actually lie for propaganda reasons and that our intelligence agency has a lot of bad reasons to overstate the threat from terrorist attacks .
