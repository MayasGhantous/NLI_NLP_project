it was delisted already ... 
  `` low quality '' yeah ... that 's why, 
  thank you !, 
  i was starting to wonder if anyone shared my opinion ... 
  the irony about the greek elections still baffles me . 
  they voted ( almost by majority ) for an extreme left party , but now , a few moths later they are having pro-eu protests in athens ... 
  they want to stay in the union but they do n't want to pay like we ( or spain , or ireland ) had to ... we all have to follow the same rules . 
  people will blame the interest rates and always try to make the other person/party seem guilty ( in this case the imf ) , the truth is that somehow they got themselves into this situation ( like we did ) but they do n't seem to be able to even ponder that it 's their own fault . 
  after years of hardship we are finally being able to turn this around !, 
  just because the greeks do n't want to go through the same ( who would really . . ) does n't mean they do n't have to ( if they want to stay in the eu of course ) . 
  shared this with [ r/portugal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/ ) we need to be reminded of the good things we do sometimes . 
  thank you for the post , great work, 
  it 's true you know , and i like to think we 're slowly working towards it, 
  that primal rivalry ... 
  i though about making that joke , i 'm glad someone did it for me, 
  shhhhh we do n't talk about pepe ... 
  we are so old that we actually forget these kinda things, 
  fucking finally took you 200 years to give that back ( remind me never to lend you guys any books ) . 
  now we can at last fight side by side !, 
   turnip farmers and iron miners no wonder there is such a huge portuguese community there , we feel right at home, 
  you have a bigger problem than just 4chan ... 
  asking the important questions, 
  one could speak all of the worlds languages and still be at a loss for words ... 
  i think that 's one of those lessons you really have to be pounded with ( like not going for the penalties ), 
  [ this is the only russian thing i know so ... ] ( https://youtu.be/rcmjetv6p9m ), 
  do n't push the shoe button with deimos, 
  if i could downvote you more deimos , i would [ - . - ] ( http://www.infoescola.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lusiadas.jpg ), 
  send screenshots !, 
  ouch man ... ca n't we just have one day ? 
  today is a day of celebration !, 
  we export alot of shoes, 
  we had a post in r/europe a few moths ago that even exemplified this . 
  it was a comparison between eu parliamentary seats and subscribers of each national subreddit , portugal had a huge gap even with our small population size edit : [ found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5t6v18/european_parliament_of_reddit_distribution_of/ ), 
  pasting what i wrote previously . 
  i 'm really proud of portugal . 
  for such an under represented country on reddit we really pulled through and managed to be one of the most long standing flags on r/place . 
  it was n't the biggest but it was [ unique ] ( https://i.redd.it/mqtj1d8uddpy.jpg ) and we made the most of it and now have a new [ hero/subreddit mascot ] ( https://i.redd.it/4rtajolbx7py.jpg ) edit because i almost forgot ^ ^ ( madatory ) portugal caralho, 
  you guys were bros < 3,

  if you 're nice you might as well stay forever, 
  yes you do, 
  i meant in portugal, 
  that 's huehuehue not hahaha, 
  interesting . 
  in those terms i think most people just think the region they were born in / live in is the `` most classical '' . 
  oddly enough , i come the most `` most classical '' and overall best wine ( and everything else ) region , porto !, 
  no , i 'm sorry . 
  i edited my reply , 
  hahahahahahahahahahahaahaahhahaha edit : sorry , i had too . 
  i do n't know how it works in other countries but here wines have no concept of `` best '' . 
  we have a few hundred critics that publish books with ratings based on their own tastes but have never reached a consensus . 
  i laughed because i do n't think i had ever heard that question before because no one can even agree on regions and regional rankings, 
  damn i completely missed a\u00e7ores ... 
  i only know about the cellar there ... '' adega coperativa da lourinh\u00e3 '' ( i believe ) do n't really know what wines they make, 
  shhhh ... let them have this, 
  consensus building is probably the first that jumps into mind . 
  the thing that actually allowed us to stop the infighting and start building up the eu, 
  yeah ... what would be so bad in destroying the mentality that allowed us to come this far ? 
   i figure you feel the remark where i tell i am the bigger person feels belittling to you you could be a case study on self refection bye, 
  i do n't ironically say it , i actually mean it . 
  go figure people are actually more complex than a few replies on a reddit thread where both parties are being dicks but one actually thinks he is being the `` bigger person '' . 
  please walk away, 
   you got to have the last word right ? 
  actually no i 'm quite well mannered most of the time and like to listen to other people 's opinions but i enjoy messing with people who feel they are entitled to it even more . 
   you kind of remind me of myself when i was 15 . at this point you are actually trying , right ? 
  see , that 's ok because i know you are being sarcastic . 
  thank you for the entertainment, 
  you 're the one who replied . 
   it seems that you allow yourself to heavily unnecessarily criticise other people and show childish behaviour , but when people rightfully want to be the bigger you do n't allow them to ? 
   because i 'm being the bigger person something a not so big person says . 
  i really got nothing against you man ... 
  but , like i said earlier , you 're giving me something to point out in every-single-reply you make !, 
  edit :  that 's it . 
  i 've seen everything ... yup , bigger person, 
  i 'd say it 's more about what can be convened through that `` thick and crude '' style than the style itself, 
  this stopped being about my comment i 'd say , a reply or two ago ... 
  i 'm just replying in hopes you can see how much of an asshole you sound like in every reply you 're giving me ... 
   i think that 's the original reason for you to delete your comment . 
   i again just suggest you to read yourself dude ... 
  i 'm deleting it because it was not measured and somewhat unrelated . 
  i do n't like seeing pretentious comments like yours but my reaction was definitely not constructive . 
  also , educated ? 
  your reply ( before that edit ) can be boiled down to `` you 're wrong , educate yourself '', 
  nothing to do with what i said , i 'm deleting my comment not because i agree with you but because much like your reply it contributes nothing to the conversation, 
  this might be the best political cartoon i 've seen in a while, 
  we killed so many people that when we were done killing our own king we instituted a dictatorship so that the government could kill us !, 
  i do n't man ... 
  it 's our culture ... 
  sometimes we just got ta kill , you know ? 
  fucking * lisboa * porto best ** continent ** porto        lisboa invicta always !!, 
  1828 best year of my life !, 
  referendum now, 
  143 years before we existed and 297 years before we drew our ( mostly current ) borders, 
  oh ... ohh fuck you let 's go iberians , where my boys at ? 
  you ca n't piss off an entire country if the country is n't real, 
  put / u/tugasnake there for shits and giggles, 
  i think it 's not a thing here . 
  we stopped having that contest for a few years and no one noticed , it came back recently and no one noticed .
