i know i was just joking . 
  i imagine that was n't either for andorrans or gibraltarians xd, 
  am i also uncivilized ? 
   the uk and bad/bland food  nandos ( a huge success story in the uk right now ) for piri-piri chicken based off of portugese recipes . 
  ... well , you know the alliance , i bet the document says : `` england should defend portugal against spain , always , and in return portugual should give to england is best piri-piri chicken based recipes '', 
  well ... now we ca n't make a revolution against spain , but maybe we can ask our [ galician ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/setembro2006_021.jpg ) brothers [ to do it ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/34171/20050727pt_paradamonte.jpg ) , 
  we got 3 felipes . 
  first one was ok , second one was `` meh ... '' , third one was sh ** . 
  but you sir , you are in the fifth . 
  btw , [ thanks . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ), 
  i meant iberian peninsula , nowadays spain and portugal ... and andorra ... and gibraltar . 
  i was talking about iberian peninsula . 
  actually romans usually called it hispania . 
  pax julia -  paxa -  beja ebora -  evora tagus -  tejo durius -  douro minius -  minho people from scallabis ( nowadays santar\u00e9m ) are known as `` escalabitanos '' ( scallabitans ) fun fact , the river `` anas '' is nowadays called guadiana . 
  `` anas '' meant `` of the ducks '' , later the moors added the prefix `` u\u00e1di '' which meant `` river '' , and we get u\u00e1diana which evolved into guadiana . 
  so saying `` river guadiana '' we we 're saying `` river river of the ducks '' , just like when we say east timor we 're actually saying `` east east '', 
  from what i heard iberia was pretty much what is today , poor local people and rich retired people from other parts of europe . 
  [ fran\u00e7oise hardy - le temps de l'amour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityvxuvmthi ), 
  are n't we from africa ? 
  is n't part of georgia ( or most of it ) in iberia ? 
  i mean ... the iberian caucasus or something like that . 
  if they 're iberians then they 're obviously nice people . 
  iberians rule !!, 
  - battle of alc\u00e1cer quibir - `` estado novo '' dictatorship , including portuguese colonial wars, 
  yes , they supported different parties , it was good for the people at the time because they had a common enemy , in this case portugal . 
  but after independence the increased number of armed vehicles and weaponry meant that the civil war was going to be more bloody than they ever expected . 
  and i 'm sure both governments of usa , ussr and china this was going to happen , so in a manner the portuguese colonial war did in fact raise to an even major conflict due to the cold war, 
  right , i never said they supported us , but they supported different `` pro-independence '' political parties with weapons , logistic and even soldiers ( like the cubans ) which was a great help for their fight against the portuguese army . 
  later those political parties would end up fighting in a civil war . 
  i 'm sure they had popular support , unfortunately for most of the time people are too calm , too passive . 
  a lot of catalans also want independence , same goes for basques and many other regions around the world but they 've little or none military support , in other hand angola , mozambique , ... had the support not only of usa but also ussr and china . 
  the portuguese colonial war was in fact another ramification of the cold war , just like vietnam or korean war . 
  off course , and let 's make this clear the people wanted the independence but it was the cold war that gave them the boost to declare war against portugal . 
  i wo n't say all of them , but some of those places are even inhabited , like cape verde , so why give independence to a territory that was discovered by portuguese people ? 
  and do n't say the typical `` but the people that lived there are n't portuguese '' , since when ? 
  nationality as nothing to do with race or religion , you can be a black muslim but still be proud of portugal . 
  most of the population that came to cape verde during the colonization are slaves , so they 're from the `` working class '' , imagine that toyota opens a big factory in germany , toyota being a japanese automotive manufacturer decides to hire 1000 japanese workers , and they all live around the area , then they 've children and grandchildren and so on , always around the area ( kind of in a island ) , do those `` japanese '' ( born already in german ) fell like they are germans ? 
  probably not . 
  should they ask for independence ? 
  well ... probably not . 
  it 's science fiction , everything is possible . 
  do n't remember us that !, 
  they beat us on everything , even at being the worst economically country in eu !, 
  - galiza ( after independence and before joining eu ) but for real , if i had to choose a country , it would be quite difficult ... brazil ? 
  cape verde ? 
  angola or mozambique ? 
  etc. . 
  i have to say that i usually do n't go to church , so i really did n't know he was the `` main-priest '' from my `` freguesia '' ( parish ? 
  ) , i knew the guy from seeing him a few times in a bar on a near village . 
  during the game he was probably the guy that said more `` bad words '' . 
  but despite the `` bad words '' and the wine , and despite myself not being an `` active '' catholic , i think it 's rather preferable to have a priest like this , that interacts with the population than a priest that does n't speaks anything bad , does n't drinks wine , does n't plays football , but in the end he simply does n't do anything , there is no interaction with the locals, 
  i 'm recovering from the 3 days of popular party at my village . 
  lots of beer , wine , sangria and caipirinha and more . 
  i helped in the festivities , meet some girls , paid some drinks , called up again for work , drink some more , party all night and all day long . 
  played football against the priest in the game of `` marrieds vs singles '' , later at night we meet him in the party drinking wine . 
  it was some good days . 
  it 's not just spain . 
  well , this time is spain , next week will be a different country . 
  the mods and me agreed that would be nice to have a weekly thread to discuss about a european country , in order to better know each others cultures , history , etc. . . 
  1 ) english 2 ) spanish 3 ) portuguese 4 ) french 5 ) german but it really depends on your life and what you want to do in the future . 
  english is an universal language , taught almost every where , so i would say it 's extremely useful , but off course since you 're already a native english speaker that does n't matter now . 
  south america is developing quite fast , if you 're an engineer , architect , related with technologies and many other services and careers it may be a good place to live and work . 
  so ... spanish , specially , but also portuguese are the main ones to learn there . 
  portuguese former-african colonies , specially mozambique and angola are also developing . 
  french just like english is taught in many schools , so it 's always important . 
  if you want to stay in europe , german is a good choice . 
  germany is the main economy of europe nowadays , and it 's also spoken in some countries around germany . 
  galician and romanian , off course , 
  if i 'm not mistaken they almost did it . 
  they had a daughter that married king manuel of portugal , and they had a son , miguel , but he died at a young age . 
  almost . 
  the world would be ( probably ) quite than it is nowadays, 
  i do n't see people doing it often here in portugal , but i think that people make the tutting when they 're disappointed with something that happened . 
  \u00d3 amigo , i said `` spain '' , not iberia or hispania . 
  ] ( http://c2.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/o5e0783ea/9744246_k8lan.jpeg ) btw , i 've seen people from galicia writting both `` galicia '' and `` galiza '' , so ... what 's the `` more '' correct one ? 
  yes , that 's why they united the `` catholic '' spain , grenada was land of `` infidels '' , ferdinand ii and isabella are called `` the catholic monarchs '' ( reyes cat\u00f3licos ), 
  in 1469 , king ferdinand ii of aragon married with queen isabella of castille , uniting both kingdoms and uniting all of the catholic spain . 
  in 1516 , charles i of spain ( grandson of ferdinand ii and isabella ) became king of spain . 
  and finally in 1715 , philip v made the `` decretos de nueva planta '' ( the nueva planta decrees ) in where he officially stated that all kingdoms are united , that all them are spain and the official language was the castillian . 
  do you have a dead-wish for flames ? 
  i 'm warming up the wood for the inquisition fire !, 
  megathreads rule !, 
  long life to the megathread !, 
  burn the infidel !, 
  / s on a side note , i 've been doing this for a while , it 's not the first of this kind , i 've no fault that people decided to make like 2 dozens of posts about the greek crisis . 
  sorry anyway . 
  it 's fun to see 3 spanish , all with a different flair/flag , spain really is a kingdom of kingdoms . 
  yesterday . 
  in portugal ( and also in spain , at least in galicia ) there 's a old folklore story about a `` kind of '' boogeyman called `` coca '' ( female ) or `` coco '' ( the male version ) the `` coca '' was a ghost/mythical figure with a pumpkin head , ( s ) he 's a child eater and kidnapper , devours the children without leaving any trace , but only if the child is disobedient . 
  in portugal there 's a lullaby that says : `` leave coca . 
  leave coca ( vai-te coca . 
  vai-te coca ) go to the top of the roof ( para cima do telhado ) let the child have ( deixa o menino ) a quiet sleep '' ( dormir um sono descansado ) in 1498 , when vasco da gama ( portuguese navigator ) stopped in the malabar region ( india ) the portuguese sailors found some trees that gave a fruit that resembled the head of the scary-figure `` coca '' or `` coco '' and so they give the name `` coco '' to that fruit . 
  which was then adapted to other languages , such as english . 
  ___________________________________________ but probably the well-known myth is about our deceased king sebastian i ( d.sebasti\u00e3o ) he died in 1578 , in alcacer-quibir ( el-ksar el kebir ) in morocco while fighting against the sultunate of morocco and the ottoman empire . 
  without descendants , 2 years later , philip ii of spain became also king of portugal . 
  because of the lost of independence , since the beginning that people appeared saying that king sebastian was still alive , some people even said to be the king themselves . 
  that originated a legend , that one day king sebastian would appear in a fog day , to save us all ( portuguese people ) and he 'll put us once again at the top , again as mighty and powerful empire that we once have been . 
  ( on a side note , we 're still waiting for that . 
  unfortunately , we 're not england , so ... fog is n't that common in here ),
