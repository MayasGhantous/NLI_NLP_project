  you 're cool too , 
  but ... but one of them is portuguese :(, 
  i understand that and i have no problems with that , but then the title is misleading since some `` western european '' countries are missing . 
  of course people can argue that portugal and italy are `` south '' european countries , but then should n't spain be also in that group ? 
  and like you have pointed if france and germany are western countries should n't luxembourg , netherlands , belgium , ... also be in that category ? 
  and seems like that western europe ... does n't includes portugal the most western country of ( continental ) europe, 
  in fact , only brazilians try to make us look inferior , n\u00e3o \u00e9 verdade ? 
  where do you get those statistics ? 
  yup, 
  long live to our karalius !, 
  it depends . 
  imagine that country x is having elections , and somebody from that country ( a `` xsian '' ) is living in country y , if that person sends money to help a party i would n't have problems at all . 
  what ?!, 
  are you dumb or something ? 
  you should read some history books !!!, 
  it was from angola !, 
  i live in a student residence , lots of foreign students , i feel like sometimes it 's easier to connect with a galician than with a brazilian , the way of talk , some of the customs , etc. . . 
  i live in a village with around 300 people . 
  there are a few young people , and we do a lot of stuff ; in other hand there are some people living `` lonely '' in big cities . 
  goa ? 
  that was in 1961 and well it was annexed by india , they won , fair enough , sometimes you win and others you lose . 
  ( btw , also daman and diu ( 1961 ) , and dadra and nagar haveli ( in 1954 ) ) in other hand you 've also macau ( 1999 ) , but again we 're not butthurt because of that , since it was an agreement made several years before , and we 've to respect that . 
  as for the african colonies ( st tom\u00e9 and principe , angola , mozambique , cape verde and guinea bissau ) , many people think that they indeed deserved their independence however it should n't have been done like it was done , basically from the night to the day hundreds and hundreds of portuguese `` run away '' from africa to portugal , and the new `` african '' governments how had no idea how to run a country starts doing it , which gave origin to civil wars . 
  so , no people are n't butthurt because of that , most people do n't even care about them , in fact we like them kind of as our brothers , our prime-minister is descendant from goans ; i have family in mozambique , angola and brazil ; one of the best friends of my deceased grandfather was from timor-leste ( and of course he 's also a family friend ) i remember being child when in 1999 people made an huge `` manifestation '' supporting the liberation of timor-leste from indonesia , with the protests ending in madrid in front of the indonesian embassy ( since there was none at the time in portugal ) , you see ... portuguese people `` going '' into madrid to protest not for them but for some people hundreds and hundreds of miles away , if that 's being butthurt , than i 'm happy with that , 
  so you 're trying to say that humanity should 've lived isolated forever ? 
  most of the american natives died due to diseases , but what fault had the troops and all the europeans on that ? 
  they did n't knew that would happen , those `` diseases '' did n't affected the european population , why would they excect them to affect the americans ? 
  the age of discovery is the first step of the globalization that we see nowadays , but just like in internet you can see videos of cats , and share videos supporting people with disabilities or raise funds to help someone you can also see horrendous videos in the deep weeb . 
  slavery already existed , science already existed , the portuguese and all the other empires only `` enlarged '' those thing for a world scale , but good and bad have always been here on earth . 
  yes , definitely, 
  we can make an union ... but only if france tries to invade us again . 
  this is great ; we 're next to our british friends ; we 've norway to sell us cod fish ; and everybody knows that in portugal we speak a russian dialect so it 's fine , we can exchange port wine for vodka with them . 
  and we do n't have spain next to us . 
  spanja bob almost squarepants ` cuz they do n't have portugal spanja bob !, 
  ^ ^ almost squarepants !, 
  `` each european city '' ? 
  where 's spain , portugal , greece , ... ? 
  back in 868 the county of portugal was created as vassal of the kingdom of asturias , being v\u00edmara peres the first count ( v\u00edmara is origin name for guimar\u00e3es ) , later on in 1071 the count nuno mendes wanter more authonomy for his county but was defeated against the king of galicia ( garcia ii ) and the county of portugal was annexed by the kingdom of l\u00e9on . 
  but then , a french guy named henry of burgundy appeared and helped alfonso vi of l\u00e9on ( and castille ) in his fights against the moors , in exchange for his help , alfonso married him with one of his daughters ( theresa ) and gave him the county of portugal ( 1096 ) henry and theresa had then a son , in 1109 , which they named afonso ( in honour of his grandfather ) . 
  but in 1112 henry dies , since his son was to young ( 3yo ) theresa began rulling in the county ; theresa then starting `` flirting '' with a galician guy named fernando p\u00e9rez , the people from the portuguese did n't quite liked it , since fernando p\u00e9rez had great power the region and they feared to lose their authonomy , but fortunately for them they are n't alone . 
  in 1128 both armies fought against each other , in a battle between mother and son ; the son won and so afonso became count of portugal , but then they thought something like `` why stop now ? '', 
  he knew that he could n't fight against alfonso ii of le\u00f3n and castile but he could do it against some armies of moors , in 1139 he won the battle of ourique ( which no one nowadays is quite sure about it ) and his proclaimed as king by is own people . 
  some years before , in 1135 , alfonso vii proclaims himself as emperor of spain with all the christian kings and noblemans `` paying '' homage to him , but not afonso of portugal ; and in 1140/41 afonso i defeats the army of alfonso vii in the battle of valdevez , which would later lead to the treaty of zamora , where alfonso vii recognized portugal as a kingdom , in 1143 . 
  so where did portugal started ? 
  maybe in guimar\u00e3es with v\u00edmara peres , or with the battle of ourique where afonso i was proclaimed king by his own people , or in 1140/41 in arcos de valdevez with the victory in the battle of valdevez or maybe in 1143 in zamora with the recognized independence by alfonso vii . 
  but if we have to choose a portuguese city/place then ... guimar\u00e3es is probably the origin , but the whole `` north '' was there at the beginning . 
  spain and portugal was mainly due to their dictatorships , so old people barely know anything of english . 
  for example coca cola only entered on the portuguese market in 1977 , just like many other foreign products it was forbidden by the `` estado novo '' ( dictatorship ) regime . 
  portuguese immigration was ( and still is ) mainly to france and so it was mostly french music that `` crossed borders '' into portugal and not english . 
  portugal only joined eec ( eu ) in 1986 ( same time of spain ) , before that ( and more specifically until 1974 ) portugal was mainly faced into their colonies ( which also spoke portuguese ) nowadays , kids/teens have at least 8 years of english in school ( or around that ) and of course are `` under '' an huge influence of anglosphere media/products . 
  let me guess : portugal ? 
  agree , snowboarding was kind of a douche guy ... 
  i was just kidding of course :p, 
  portugal is n't a powerfull country but it 's a country with some good relations worldwide , it would open angola ( and all the former african colonies of portugal ) to spanish investors , and also brazil and china ( through macau , but also due to recent parternships between portugal and chinese enterprises ) . 
  so despite portugal being a country without good reasons to invest it 's kind of a bridge to better places . 
  same in portugal , and i believe also spain and france so it must be a `` latin '' kind of stuff to do ... 
  yes , it 's mandated . 
  the number of castles at the top varies depending if it 's the capital ( lisbon ) with 5 golden castles ; other cities have 5 silver castles ; towns have 4 silver castles ; villages and urban parishes have 3 silver castles . 
  they may also use a `` necklace '' like \u00c9vora which symbolize that they have received some kind of `` high-reward '' ( order of `` something '' ) . 
  seems like [ saint martin of tours ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_of_tours ), 
  [ some portuguese coat of arms ... ] ( https://imgur.com/a/wpxfs ),

  you 're speaking of russia land area ... that 's where the `` 17\u00a0100\u00a0000 '' came from . 
  but those 7,566,673 are only from russian eez area . 
  merry christmas to our long lost brothers !, 
  17\u00a0100\u00a0000 ... maybe that 's counting with some disputed areas ? 
  i 'm just guessing . 
  for portugal the `` national tree '' is the cork oak ( sobreiro ) , sure it 's still a kind of oak but it 's a specific type of oak tree not all of them . 
   miguel , if i believed in fate , i would n't be playing with loaded dice, 
  i have two ... [ linhas de wellington ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1928329/ ) ( lines of wellington ) and [ capit\u00e3es de abril ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120626/ ) ( captains of april ), 
  probably it 's `` j\u00e1 vai ! '', 
  which means something like `` i ( will ) go right away !, 
  '' , that 's what you usually say when somenody calls you while you 're doing something, 
  back in the 12th century , the first king of portugal [ afonso i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) conquered most of what 's nowadays portugal from the moors ( north african muslims ) however the portuguese population was extremely low , and while he conquered a city another one was again lost to the moors . 
  so is son , [ sancho i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sancho_i_of_portugal ) while not a great fighter like is father understand however that what the kingdom needed was more people and so `` he '' asked people from far away lands to go inhabit those newly conquered lands from the moors . 
  the main `` tribes '' that arrived in portugal were the flemish , the franks and burgundians , all of them germanics tribes ; others came even from further away lands . 
  so in the very beggining of the creation of the portuguese kingdom , the `` natives '' mixed up with germanics , which probably helped to create the portuguese language that we nowadays know . 
  yes , it 's . 
  but some people think that we speak a mix of spanish with russian , kind of like if a russian decided to go living in spain and tried to speak spanish he would ended up speaking ... portuguese . 
  russian-latin speaker here . 
  i have a friend named vasco , and he 's kind of our obama , because whenever something bad happens we say `` obrigadinho \u00f2 vasco '' ( thanks , vasco ! ), 
  or whenever it is to put the guilty in someone we reply `` foi o vasco ! '', 
  ( it was vasco ) . 
  of course you being a basque/vasco i had to accuse you . 
  thanks , vasco !, 
  when did said that basques are neo-nazis ? 
  do n't turn yourself into a victim . 
  i was just giving an example , and you surely understand it . 
  it 's youth . 
   and does n't want people correcting him . 
  when did i said so ? 
  i would be glad and thankful to you if you corrected me and helped me improve my portuglish to a decent english, 
  probably better than you vasco , 
  i know that the basque country is within spain probably the region with best rate in employment but still ... the problem was n't the joke the problem is `` who '' says the joke , a joke about jews and gas said by a canadian , yeah , that 's fine , the same joke told by neo-nazi , well probably not that funny ... and seems that even your comrades agree with me , at least / u/iagovar, 
  `` look a greek guy , that in is native language do n't even use the latin alphabet , made an error , let me , a dutch speaker ( a close related language with english ) mock him because of that , despite the fact that what he says is right ... ahahahah '' . 
  says the ~ ~ basque ~ ~ spaniard living in a country with huge unemployment specially among young people . 
  do n't throw rocks in the air if your house is made of glass, 
  anyone knows what countries are the other top 10 destinations in europe ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken coimbra , in portugal , have 100 % led streetlights . 
  note : the citiy have around 35000 streetlights .
