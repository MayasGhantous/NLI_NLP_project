   sounds like russia the language , the life style ... we 're probably some kind of distant cousins from russians . 
  same here , hermano , 
  th 5th november in * portuguese * history : - in 1538 the first [ siege of diu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_diu ) finally ends , with the victory of the portuguese empire over the gujarat sultunate and the ottoman empire ( with the largest ottoman fleet ever sent into the indian ocean ) , the portuguese would only lose diu 423 years later , in december of 1961 . 
  let 's join forces between the [ commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) and the [ cplp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_community_of_portuguese_language_countries ), 
  british empire , spanish empire , french empire , portuguese empire , dutch empire .

   an unnamed man it 's actually / u/ashihna, 
  who 's the sultan ? 
  you may be a eurospectic or in other hand a pro-european , but the so-called `` portuguese political crisis '' as nothing to do with europe ; most of the deputies on the portuguese parlment are in favor of `` keeping '' portugal in eu ; this is more a `` internal '' issue , most people wants to be in eu , the thing is if we should reach the goals going right or left .

  [ this one was suspected of killing more than 70 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diogo_alves ) and died with `` just '' 31 years old . 
  well , being portuguese , i do like it very much  i was simply surprised , i did n't even put spain and france and italy are 5 and 6 beyond germany , uk and finland , 3 countries that in terms of weather and way of living are slightly different from portugal . 
  portugal ? 
  from what part of usa are you ? 
  ( if we may know ) ps : besides gotham . 
  galiza is nice , but from all the regions of spain extremadura is the closer one from me . 
  if portugal did n't exist , of course i would n't mind living in spain , they 're probably the closer to us that we can get . 
  so be it , spain . 
  edit : in my case i would specifically choose the extremadura region, 
  did n't exist as like `` magically '' the land where it 's located disappeared from earth , or simply did n't exist as an independent country ? 
   no , it starts in the pyrenees . 
  almost the same thing , i was n't including people from andorra ... but yes . 
  but spain is already in africa , i do n't get it : / everybody knows that africa starts in the iberian peninsula ... 
  everytime i read something starte with `` french '' `` france '' `` franc ... '' i immediately think that dclauzel is behind the post x ), 
  the one about the new elections , usually there 's always about a megathread when there 's elections in a european country . 
  yes , another megathread about portugal in / r/europe !, 
  we did it guys , we did it !, 
  - 1383 : dies [ ferdinand i of portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_portugal ) , without heirs to the thrown , his dead leads to a [ succession crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_portugal ) , after 2 years of battles against castile , john i of portugal was crowned king , starting the 2nd dinasty in portugal , but also the alliance with england and the portuguese discoveries . 
  - 1636 , the [ portuguese inquisition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_inquisition ) was established in 23/05/1636 , being the bula `` cum ad nihil magis '' published in the city of \u00c9vora , on this day ( 22 october ) . 
  the portuguese inquisition would be abolished in the year of 1821 . 
  - 1689 , borns [ john v of portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_v_of_portugal ) , the portuguese sun-king or the magnificient . 
  he was a very religious man , granting several donatives to the church and special to the vatican , pope benedict xiv granted him the title of [ `` most faithful majesty '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most_faithful_majesty ) , churchs , monsteries , embassies to france , rome , china , etc. . . john v did n't spare any costs in order to proclaim the name of portugal outside of its empire . 
  - 1807 , a secret treaty was made between the kingdom of portugal and britain , signed in london , named [ `` secret convention on the transfer of portuguese monarchy to brazil '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_convention_on_the_transfer_of_the_portuguese_monarchy_to_brazil ) , which would actually happen a month later . 
  this act together with napoleon invasions would lead to the portuguese civil war and to the independence of brazil . 
  - 1945 , was formed the [ pide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pide ) ( international police and state defence ) , a portuguese security service agency during the estado novo ( `` portuguese dictatorship '' ) , following the model of the scotland yard with full powers to investigate , detain and arrest anyone who was thought to be plotting against the state . 
  pide used a system of encouraging citizens to denounce suspicious activities ( somehow similar with the method during the inquisition ) , this system was extremely effective , since through benefits ( monetaries or not ) the state controled almost every of aspect of the `` common '' portuguese during is daily life . 
  let me go get the port wine !, 
  indeed , you 're absolutely correct and it kind reminds me of another city , what 's the name of it ? 
  o. . . oli ? ... oh right , oliven\u00e7a , 
  poland ? 
  ... oh wait , is that a mosque in the background ? 
  [ kingdom of portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_portuguese_flags#/media/file:portugueseflag1095.svg ) ? 
  [ nocal is best cal !, 
  ] ( http://i.colnect.net/images/f/261/826/nocal.jpg ), 
  california is the iberian peninsula of usa , 
  * figo ( like the fruit fig ) and not fuego which is spanish for fire , 
   portugal who is luis silva ? 
  those people that you mentioned usually talk in a more `` educated '' way ( at least while talking to the costumer ) does n't the same happen in brazil ? 
  and i usually do n't go to lisbon , maybe they use it more often there , and maybe is like you said we usually memorize what 's is strange to us , if we see a gray cat then is just one more cat , but if you see let 's imagine a pink cat you probably will remember it , you probably heard people sayign `` voc\u00ea '' but your memory simply ignore it since it 's just another common word . 
  while speaking we also use `` voc\u00ea '' on a regular basis , sure older people usually say `` tu '' or `` v\u00f3s '' but it 's not a general thing , i believe it 's more of a stereotype in brazil , most of portuguese imigrants in brazil have arrived in the 50s and 60s and probably still use a lot of `` v\u00f3s '' and even some expressions already `` forgotten '' here in portugal . 
  just to put a non-nordic flag in this chain . 
  i have already been in spain , italy and france , but in that case i was specifically speaking about estonia and eastern countries , how many times you see estonia in the portuguese news ? 
  and angola or east timor ? 
  that 's the point , we get more information about those countries , we share the same language and some common traditions , but in other hand in physical terms we probably have more in common with eastern europeans and i even ended my text saying `` but then , they ( goans , macanese , ... ) do look diferent '' mas sim , ok . 
  it 's not about the size , east timor is also small but we ( portuguese ) have news from them once in all . 
  anyway ... a shake of hands to you fellow european . 
  on this day ( on the portuguese history ) ... - in 1527 , [ maria manuela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_manuela,_princess_of_portugal ) daughter of jo\u00e3o iii of portugal was born , she would later marry philip ii of spain , and they had a son called carlos , prince of asturias , due to the consaguinity he had only 4 great-granparents instead of 8 , and only six great-great-grandparents instead of 16 !, 
  - fernando pessoa was a famous portuguese poet , and one of his well-know heteronyms was [ \u00c1lvaro de campos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_de_campos ) , which was born today in the year of 1890 ( fernando pessoa was born in 13/06/1888 ) - also in this day , was born [ v\u00edtor ba\u00eda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%adtor_ba%c3%ada ) , former-goalkepper of the portuguese national team , fc porto and fc barcelona . 
  - in previous day portugal defeated the castilian troops in the [ battle of valverde in 1385 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_valverde_%281385%29 ), 
  i do n't know , it really depends , me being a portuguese , i have probably heard more times about china or india than estonia , and it 's always fascinating when we 're watching the news or something like that in a far away country like china and when we see that guy hundreds and hundreds of kilometers away from you shares the same surname as you or someone you know . 
  like when we see a documentary about macau , with the [ streets with all those cantonese characters but then here it 's the translation to portuguese ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n7jo3_zlmpi/tso9fvadeui/aaaaaaaabsg/lscjvux6gke/s1600/china+1123.jpg ) . 
  but then , they do look diferent , they are far way , so i really do n't know . 
  portugal is in the tip of europe , we do n't communicate much with anyone , so we live kind of isolated , probably we have some traces in common with all europe but we simply do n't look at them, 
  a ) iberian union - because of that we start being attacked by the dutch empire and unlike other times we did n't get the help from england ( actually we 've been attacked by them ) b ) low population - we had n't enough population to make a huge army and neither to populate such a vast territory , that 's why the marriage between portuguese people and natives from the `` discovered '' areas was well-received . 
  c ) methuen treaty - in economic terms it ended up being a disasster for the economy of portugal . 
  d ) lisbon earthquake - which was then half a century later followed by the french invasions and then the portuguese civil war e ) religion - the majority of the gold ( income ) was used in things related to the church instead of investments to the future . 
  etc. . . 
  `` do so badly '' at what point ? 
  being honest about this , for me , an `` average joe '' , it really does n't matter who is going to be the government . 
  let 's face it , we have debts to pay and we have `` rules '' to follow , those rules are made by the european union , specifically the ecb , so either it 's a left , right or center government in the end of the day is the whole europe that `` dictates '' ( kind of strong word here ... ) what portugal should do . 
  still , i think that it would be more fair if we had a `` 2nd round '' with the leftist parties already joined together ( if they 're actually thinking in doing so ), 
  portugal , where people speak a latin language with a slavic accent . 
  still , we did n't split from spain but from the house of habsburg , technically portugal remained as an independent country governed by a foreign king . 
  take the example of australia , an independent country but the queen is still elizabeth ii of uk . 
  what made the political union end was exactly that , the fact that philip iv ( iii in portugal ) thought that portugal was just another province of spain . 
  windshield . 
  what do you mean by cod and chips ? 
  we have a lot of diferent recipes with cod fish ... 
  we ca n't be your ally if that 's the case ... : / next you 're telling me that you do n't drink port wine ? 
  portuguese wine  galician wine  extremaduran wine  rest of spanish wine :p, 
  it 's kind hard to find a second europe 's sport , for example in portugal it 's probably roller hockey but then if you look at nordic countries they probably prefer ice hockey instead ...
