  the flag of azores represents a goshwak , a\u00e7or in portuguese being the plural a\u00e7ores which gave origin to the name of the archipelago ( azores ) . 
  the archipelago as 9 islands ( that 's why the 9 stars ) , commonly divided in 3 groups : eastern group , central group and western group with the goshawk spawning is wings in all islands and looking to the right ( since it 's there where is located portugal ),

  - the coat in the center , are the `` quinas '' ( also in the portuguese flag ) , representing the 5 moorish kings that afonso i of portugal defeated in the battle of ourique . 
  - in the bottom it says `` cidade de our\u00e9m '' which meeans `` city of our\u00e9m '', 
  this day ( 8th october ) , in portugal : - this day does n't technically exist in the spanish , portuguese and italian calendar - in 1582 , philip ii of spain decreed the change between the julian to gregorian calendar , it affected not only spain but also portugal and some parts of italy ( under rule of philip ) , due to this change they had to `` erase '' the day 8th of 1582 . 
  - in 1945 the movement of democratic unity ( movimento de unidade democr\u00e1tica in portuguese ) a political organization was founded in order to oppose against the `` estado novo '' of salazar . 
  the party would be banned in 1948 . 
  - jos\u00e9 saramago was notified on this day about is nobel prize of literature . 
  if we would go for history then every country would need to increase is army due to the fact that almost everyone had been attacked several times by a more powerful `` neighboor '' . 
  the reason in this case is n't history , unfortanetely , but rather the present , looking at ukraine is easy to see why poland needs to bet on the military . 
  we 're ruled by philip ii/iii/iv of spain but not by spain itself . 
  for example australia is an independent country , right ? 
  however queen elizabeth is still the queen of australia . 
  what happen was that we had 2 different countries ruled by the same man , but we never had a flag of the iberian union , the ships , castles and everything in portugal still carried on the portuguese flag , the counts and dukes of portugal keep their status , etc. . . what happen was that when philip iv of spain ( iii in portugal ) started his reign he tried to abolish all that and turn portugal another `` spanish '' region ( like nowadays galiza or catalonia ) and `` pow !, 
  portuguese revolution ! '', 
  france never ruled the country , they only invaded it , the government ( court ) was relocated ( to rio , brazil ) and keep doing all the business and political affairs .

  but i kind guy it , we 're the ones that got away from the spanish dominion , we 're kind of an example for the basque country and catalonia ( and damn it , also to galiza ! ), 
  of course land does n't have political views , land does n't have feelings too and neither discussions . 
  but we as humans can always discuss , in a good way , in order to show our point of view and to see the point of view of other people . 
  this is just a map nothing more . 
  and we 're a people nothing more . 
  there are probably people living in those mountains and working on those farms , obviously there are more people living in the litoral rather the in the inside but they 're still people with the right to vote and this is just a map showing percentages not total votes . 
  but the map is probably good to make some few interpretations ... for example , i think that being the litoral more populated with the bigger cities of catalonia , those areas have also higher immigration , are more cosmopolitan and have a greater interaction with the rest of spain . 
  in other hand the inland , populated like you say by farmers , probably also older people and with less resources , with fewer contact with the rest of spain may have `` resisted '' more time with their catalan culture once why they voted for the jxs\u00ed + cup,

  it is n't much as they `` do n't recognize '' it 's more like a `` meh ... whatever , but oliven\u00e7a is ours '' , however in reality everything is ok , and the status quo remains . 
  we 're a * stretched * square ... also known as rectangle, 
  i do n't remember the event that well , but i 'm quite sure portugal did n't sided with morocco ( and neither with spain ) . 
  but portugal not helping spain in that case was more of a political move , if portugal helped them that would mean they recognized the spanish sovereignty over ceuta and melilla , and portugal could n't be like two face saying `` hey it 's totally ok for spain to have them ... but now , give back oliven\u00e7a !

  here is usually turkey , chicken and catfish . 
  but might be something more regional , for instance in alentejo probably they eat it with pork , but i 'm not sure , so i guess in spain this gastronomical division is even bigger . 
  and what fish/meat do you ( spanish people ) usually put in it ? 
  every dish have a different flavour , cod fish is like oxygen for us , then we add another atoms to make different molecules and organisms . 
  panado . 
  wiki :  in portugal , schnitzel is called bife panado or just panado ( `` breaded '' ) . 
  different varieties of panado can be made with chicken ( panado de frango ) , turkey ( panado de peru ) , pork ( costeleta panada for pork chop , febra panada for pork without bone ) , or veal ( escalope de vitela panado ) . 
  the meat is usually seasoned with black pepper , garlic , and lemon juice . 
  it is commonly served with spaghetti , fried potatoes , or rice ( plain or with beans ) . 
  it is also popular as a sandwich , served in a bun with lettuce ( sandes de panado ) . 
  ** bacalhau ** changed world history ... back in medieval times portugal was known for is salt production and so many naval nations would go into portugal , including greeks , phoenicians and [ norsemen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siglas_poveiras ) . 
  norse people would bring cod fish ( bacalhau ) with them and consume of this fish by portuguese people kind of started there . 
  in 1214 the daughter of sancho i of portugal marries valdemar ii of denmark , and , few years later , in 1229 the daughter of afonso ii of portugal marries valdemar iii the connection between portugal and the northern kingdom was quite strong at the time . 
  a century later , in 1353 , peter i of portugal and edward ii of england stablish a fishing agreement where it was stipulated that portuguese sailors could fish `` bacalhau '' within english * seas * for a period of 50 years . 
  later this relation between portugal and england made another step , with the anglo-portuguese alliance in 1373 and later the treaty of windsor in 1386 . 
  with the help of england against castile ( spain ) and the nautical knowledge learnt from greeks , moors and danes , portugal would venture into their seafarer adventures in 1415 . 
  in 1494 the tordesillas treaty between castile and portugal was signed , but before the portuguese king asked for the line to be `` a bit more to the left '' and with that portugal gained the rights of possession of brazil ... and the coast of canada . 
  with that around 1500 portuguese explorers would reach the `` terra nova do bacalhau '' short after called only as `` terra nova '' or `` new land '' nowadays `` newfoundland '' portugal sailors keep going into newfoundland until 1974 to * catch * bacalhau . 
  either on the sea going into oriental lands like india and japan for the spices , or into brazil for the gold , with the family during christmas or as a snack in a pastry shop , the cod fish was there together with the portuguese , and for that reason * bacalhau * is known here as `` o fiel amigo '' ( the faithful friend ), 
  it really depends , i do n't made mine ( i buy it from an old man of my village ) but usually it 's stronger ( more alcohol ) and a bit more gruff ( ? ), 
  than the ones we buy in the market , as for the quality in general it kind varies from year to year , either the weather was good or not . 
  can confirm all the liters of wine i drink weekly are not counted in this statistic since it 's home made wine and not bought in the market,

  according to pantheon ? 
  what pantheon ? 
   islamic  ...  spain are you talking about heart attacks ? 
   growing up in a popular tourist destination was a lot of fun . 
  i live near f\u00e1tima ( portugal ) a popular tourist destination ... unfortunately is mostly old ladies from ireland , italy and spain and nuns . 
  for us , the locals , basically nothing , we always appreciated our food very much , while some people go to chinese/japanese/indian / brazilian / ... restaurants most people still prefer to eat the traditional portuguese food , the one that resembles our `` grandmas food '' that seems more genuine . 
  but for foreigners , there 's been most of all an increase of marketing , not only of the food but country in general and so more and more people are starting to know about it , 10 years ago people heard about portugal and thought `` why go to portugal when i can go to spain ? 
  it 's bigger and after all ... it 's all the same '' but either because of football , the south-european economical crisis , political names such as dur\u00e3o barroso or guterres , have placed portugal 's name under the radar of many news articles around the world . 
  i did n't said that someone `` said that '' . 
  what i wrote was : `` let 's not all jump into pre-made conclusions '' , notice the * let 's not * meaning that i was trying to * prevent * people into doing so , sorry if i gave the wrong impression , as you can say by my flair english ai n't my native language . 
  is this an wealthy related issue ? 
  you can be an woman working in a farm earning 1 $ a day but still have better treatment in terms of equality ( compared with men ) than a woman in a fancy suit working in a big corporate . 
  but i do get your point . 
  just because algeria is in north africa and have muslim majority let 's not all jump into pre-made conclusions and think right away that they 're all `` islamic radicals '' . 
  eheheh, 
  here in portugal , more usually in the rural areas , people mix coffee with [ baga\u00e7o ] ( http://catavino.net/aguardente-bagaceira-portugals-seriously-strong-wine-spirit/ ), 
  wrong , you do n't act like one , you only try . 
  do n't fly , do n't lay eggs , etc. . . 
  i wo n't say that * currently * they 're all europeans , but some of them are indeed already european both geographically and in their way of thinking and probably the number will keep rising . 
  so what i 'm trying to say is that we do n't need to put turkey in eu and neither to include turkey in the european side of our school maps , but if there are a faction of turks that think like us europeans then all we have to do is at least be `` nice '' to them and be happy that * our * european principles ( including compassion , union , ... ) are being spread in places that some years ago we would probably think was impossible to happen . 
  not a long tradition ? 
  compared with who ? 
  what if he lives in east thrace and his part of the christian minority ?
