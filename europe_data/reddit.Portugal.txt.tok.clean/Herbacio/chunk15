  portuguese references : - map - portugal was the * final refuge * for neanderthal man ( and now not even the syrians want to live here ... ) - reference of portugal and spain was being 2 of the greatest naval powers of the 15th century - portugal established colonies in america , asia ( and also africa ) - ww1 , portugal was part of the entente powers - table ( x2 ) - pigs crisis - portuguese * emigration * in the 16th century - notes ( x3 ), 
   and some islands in india the seven islands of bombay ... which * evolved * to mumbai, 
  portugal was in world war 1 , both in europe and africa . 
  in world war 2 they did n't participate specially because the british feared that would mean spain joining the axis , which would end up with france surrounded from east ( germany ) , south ( italy ) and west ( spain ) however portugal ceased the [ lajes air base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) in azores to the americans helping in the transatlantic flights , and this one of the main reasons why despite not directly in the conflict portugal ended up being one of the founding members of nato, 
  are you in reddit ? 
  but the truth is the `` downward '' really started after king sebastian , specially economically , spain was in war with `` half '' of europe and ended up in that war too , because of that portugal lost most of its influence in indian ocean and `` all '' the money was to fund spanish wars against the british ( our longest allies ) and against the dutch ( which because of the iberian union ended up attacking brazil , angola and portuguese colonies in the indian ocean ) if it was n't for the iberian union , the british technically could n't have attacked portugal in their east india colonies , the dutch probably would n't attack portugal since they had a common enemy ( spain ) in other hand , brazil would be a smaller country than it is today , or maybe even bigger , it really depends on how would spain survive fighting against the dutch , british and portuguese empire . 
  maybe we would have ended up with an kind-of world war with the french empire also intervening . 
  but do n't worry , it was founded by a portuguese guy named fernando ( once why `` nando 's '' ) , and the symbol of nando 's is a famous symbol of portugal , the '' [ barcelos rooster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rooster_of_barcelos ) '', 
  ottomans ? 
  9 may , it was signed in windsor the alliance between portugal and england , the [ treaty of windsor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_windsor_%281386%29 ), 
  - you have 2 sharp teeth ? 
  go to romania . 
  - you have a mustache ? 
  go to portugal . 
  i 've `` always '' heard about galicians being also small , but i 'm not sure, 
  global warming was n't a thing at the time ... 
  the colors made me feel like it 's an african country , but like * they * said `` beyond the pyrenees begins africa * but what i really like the most about the flag is the armillary sphere , that golden globe . 
  not because `` d'oh ma empire !, 
  portugal stronk ! '', 
  but rather due to the fact that it symbolizes globalization , you may have dragons , lions , castles and even the sun and the moon , but we 've all nations , the all world inside or * african * flag , so take that england !, 
  and like catherine of braganza said `` take the tea too , my good old friend ! '', 
  is due to the type of game , smaller players are better for their system of playing, 
  yes , true , i 'm 1,82 m and all my friends have all around that height , in other hand my father is probably almost 10cm shorter than me, 
  1.72 is true latin !, 
  ^ ^ right ^ ^ ? 
  right romania ? 
  macau :') he 's probably huehuehueing about this right now, 
  probably a bit more than galician but still less than spanish . 
  i think in part is due to history , most of the superheroes emerged during the world wars . 
  the european countries could go back in `` their '' history and giving their troops and civilians some boost by saying `` let 's all be like charlemagne ! '', 
  or `` let 's beat them like wellesley did with napoleon ! '', 
  while in other hand usa major battles at the time had been the civil war ( and so choosing someone from that time could be somehow dividing for the nation ) and the independence war ( where sure they could `` praise '' about , e.g. , george washington , but for instance many of them are british-born citizens and others are better remember for their political roles rather than their military actions ) , and so the `` propaganda '' had the urge , the need to support the comic artists . 
  wish i was drunk now . . but i run out of wine, 
  speaking of liberia ... that area ( gold coast , guinea ) was influenced by several european countries , from the portuguese , dutch , british , french and if i 'm not mistaken even the swedes , and while most people living in nowadays liberia were descendants of free slave from usa , they 're sent to america much probably from that same area ... the gold coast . 
  probably it 's from spanish `` na ** ranja ** '' , but either way it 's quite sure it 's from the iberian peninsula , either due to the `` spanish netherlands '' or due to the commerce between portugal and netherlands or even a bit of both with the sephardite jews that emigrated from iberia to netherlands . 
   is turkey mad at spain or something ? 
  maybe they 're mad with us , [ portugal ] ( http://p2.sfora.pl/e0468d2b0c56934b1ee263b1305f8609.jpg ), 
  i had to do it while they 're on their siestas ... 
  sure , but * oliven\u00e7a is ours . 
  there 's probably someone from asterix village 's that has some lusitanian relative ... but the rest of the family is probably working either in helvetia or in luxemburgum, 
   portugal : 94  luxembourg : 95 those numbers are indeed close ... 
  that 's surely a great psychology teacher ...  hey you there !, 
  are you askezan\u00ed ? 
  meh ... sucks to be you then, 
  desdita means `` unlucky '' - des + dita = des ( the inverse ) + dita ( luck ) - dita + osa = dita ( lucky ) + oso/a ( used to form adjectives ) so * dita * is both a form of the verb * dizer * ( say ) but also a synonim for the word sorte ( luck ) if i 'm not mistaken it derived from * bendita * ( blessed ) ( from the latin benedictus ) and since most people associated that word with being `` well fortunate '' then ... for sure , since `` ben '' ( read as bem meant well ) then dita was fortunate . 
  the current usage of the word dita to mean luck drop off with time , however some variants of the word like `` desdita '' and even `` ditosa '' are still used nowadays . 
  we think outside the box . 
  was n't the sign referring to the portuguese coat of arms ? 
  ( which includes a `` cross '' ), 
  the one from portugal is really better in portuguese , the translation does n't quite give the same impact ... 
  the `` family network '' is a common thing in portugal too , but it happens that while you may have strong connections with your parents and live in their home till 30 , there will be a time you will leave ... and for sure there 's some uncle , older brother or cousin working in france , luxembourg or whatever and you can bet that either you working your ass-off or you will be a dissapointment for your family ( like , `` he does n't have any studies , does n't find a job here and does n't even tries * outside * ... '' ), 
  that 's not funny : / the language is n't brazilian , that does n't even exists !, 
  it 's mozambican !, 
  it 's a country in eastern europe , with around 42m people and 603,628 km ^ ^ 2 ... or 576,628 km ^ 2 if you 're russian . 
  plus there a lot of ukrainians here in portugal , good workers and nice people . 
  the best mechanic in my area of residence is ukrainian . 
  i think in those 1.2 million they 're counting people born already in france from portuguese parents . 
  speaking of portuguese communities living abroad , it was amazing to see people from canada to east timor partying , screaming and cheering up after portugal won the euro 2016 . 
   the portuguese are explorers . 
  it 's genetic . 
  even if things are not too bad they have to go and see the world . 
  [ `` para nascer , portugal : para morrer , o mundo '' ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnxox8f1kne/tbwqhb3azci/aaaaaaaaapk/k7mm257a0eu/s1600/dsc_0158.jpg ) ( to be born portugal ; to die , the world ) - [ ant\u00f3nio vieira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_vieira ), 
  we * kickstarted * the age of discoveries , it 's already on our mindset that going abroad is `` natural '', 
  i have family in france , mozambique , brazil and canada , also friends in switzerland , uk and belgium . 
  officially recognized yes . 
  then there were also some minority languages like [ barranquenho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barranquenho ) ( ~ 1500 speakers ) and [ minderico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minderico_language ) ( ~ 500 speakers ), 
  ceuta was portuguese between 1415 and 1668 . 
  one thing is the people moving outside of portugal , another is the companies moving . 
  for instance , a portuguese could gain the double in luxembourg , but in other hand a enterprise from france could benefit from low-paid employers , a new market ( and their connections ) , etc. . . 
  that remembered me that probably many people think the sculpture is in lisbon or somewhere in mainland portugal when in fact its in madeira , an island south of ^ ^ mainland portugal, 
  red , orange , green and grey !, 
  yes , i know , just remembered that because of the gibraltar talk, 
  ah yes , true , there 's no much to argue from spain , neither the treaty or the people from gibraltar are on their side . 
  but indeed in a * outside * view , the smuggling and tax haven are n't exactly points in favour of uk specially now with the brexit . 
  that 's why i gave the example of the `` factory '' , what if they voted that they wanted to be from spain ? 
  that thing is , if we open that precedent soon every china town , little italy , etc. . . would want to do the same . 
  of course we can argue that 's different , but the reason those cases are so complicated it 's simply because they 're indeed complicated so the best option is maintain the status-quo, 
   so the azores are a colony as well ? 
  well , the azores had nobody living there ...  what else do you need ? 
  nothing , that 's my point . 
  we can brag about the population wanting or not to be british , but in the end that 's all that matters, 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ trying ^ ^ to ^ ^ start ^ ^ a ^ ^ `` political '' ^ ^ war , but i heard that back in ~ 1930 before franco got into power , there were still people in olivenza who would speak portuguese but due to the `` castilinization '' of spain they 're killed or forced to leave , probably similar to what happen with galicians , catalans , etc. . . who are forced to speak castilian . 
  i mean it 's still a * colony * ... simply the natives have been ride out from gibraltar . 
  imagine that a factory from china opens in barcelona , the employers , all from china , go live in a neighbourhood , within a few generations a village of around 1000 chinese says that it 's `` china territory '' , but of course things do n't work that way . 
  gibraltar is uk territory because a treaty said so , nothing more . 
  'cause bombing spain with a nuclear bomb means that not only spain would be affected by it but also british allies like france and portugal , the north africa rich in resources like gas and let 's not forget that the radioactive dust could easily go north into the uk itself , unless of course uk is excepting the strong winds to help them like in 1588 . 
  and once again portugal is the eastern european of western europe, 
  no problem luxembourg . 
  i mean ... it 's an ass , of course it 's warm and windy . 
  they do that mostly to foreigners . 
  i 'm not from lisbon but from all the times i have been there they have never offered me anything . 
  that 's why i say , even if you want some hash or any kind of drug do n't ever accept it from those guys wandering around the street , it 's much probably some fake thing imitating drug , you wo n't enjoy it , they gain money with it and in the next second they 're selling some more to another tourist . 
  in other hand , if tourists stop buying from them , like any business without selling will eventually disappear . 
  plus while consuming is decriminalized , selling is still a crime so of course people would n't be doing it in the middle of street screaming `` hashish ? 
  hashish ?!, 
  you want some hashish ?! '' . 
  if you want real drugs and a not be bothered by those fake sellers , just go talk to some * native * smoking near a bar , probably he will know where to buy drugs ( or someone who knows ), 
  for a very short period in 1826 , peter i of brazil became also peter iv of portugal ( due to his father death ) his title during that time was : his most faithful majesty ... by the grace of god and unanimous acclamation of the people , constitutional emperor and perpetual defender of brazil , king of portugal and the algarves , of either side of the sea in africa , lord of guinea and of conquest , navigation , and commerce of ethiopia , arabia , persia , and india , etc. 
  indeed , if any tourist wants to smoke some joint or whatever the best thing is to ask a * local * first instead of buying directly from a random vendor ( which quite probably is selling some fake s *** ) . 
  it 's a win-win situation , you enjoy the right thing and the locals slowly get ride of those fake vendors that appeared in lisbon like a plague in egypt .
