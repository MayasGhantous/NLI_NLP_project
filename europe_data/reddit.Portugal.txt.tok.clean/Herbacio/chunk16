  , was born in 1714 and was king of portugal between 1750 and 1777 . 
  he married [ mariana victoria of spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mariana_victoria_of_spain ) ( daughter of philip v of spain ) in 1729 . 
  in 1755 the [ lisbon earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_lisbon_earthquake ) brought down the capital of the portuguese empire . 
  joseph i developed a severe case of claustrophia due to that a moved all the court to * tents * where he lived the rest of his life . 
  in 1759 he [ expelled the jesuits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suppression_of_the_society_of_jesus#portugal_and_its_empire_1759 ) ( society of jesus ) in [ 1762 a franco-spanish army invaded portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_invasion_of_portugal_%281762%29 ) , it ws the biggest mobilisation of spanish troops in all the xviii century . 
  the portuguese troops are commanded by schaumburg-lippe and he wrote that * in a night * before a battle , he found portuguese men with old rifles and worst of all ... some were even unarmed , when he asked them `` how are you going to fight ? '', 
  they showed him bags full with rocks they had picked up through the way . 
  in the end , with some british help , the invaders were defeated . 
  massive coin ? 
  we better check on a american guy called bruce wayne . 
  are you sure you bought hash and not some pressed laurel or baby powder ? 
  i bet uk trusted us more ... king charles ii trusted in our princess . 
  the wealthy brits on our pink map . 
  the drunk brits on our wine . 
  and maddie on our subsoil . 
  long live the alliance !, 
  yes . 
  comment sections usually end up with a brazilian saying `` our version is better and portuguese people are poor !, 
  '' , a portuguese saying : `` shut up !, 
  you probably live in a * favela * '' , and a angolan saying : `` it 's all your fault !, 
  racist '' , and a random foreigner saying `` huehuehue '' ( despite being a video in european portuguese ), 
  portuguese soldier : sit down , with a smile in his face while eating/drinking . 
  in reality , the country was going through a political crisis ( republic was only 4 years old ) , they had huge debts to england ( one of the reasons they had to step aside in the `` pink map '' some decades before ) , and by 1914 the world war had already started , and while portugal only official entered on war in 1917 ... they 're neighboring germany in africa , both in angola and mozambique , so the mobilization of troops started right from the beggining with some skirmishes between troops in the borders . 
  so not so happy as is it may seem at first . 
  as a portuguese i have to put it on that list too , most foreigners only know about port wine , when most of us here in general drink wines from other regions . 
  new ? 
  yup , but we hide it on the mountains away from the tourists . 
  it 's kind of strange that more galician attacks did n't happen during the 70s and 80s , during that time there was also terrorist organizations in portugal ( pro-communist and pro-fascist ) they could probably have allied and give * cover * to each other . 
  but luckily for * us * that did n't happen . 
  wait ... so what happen ? 
  a catalan and a galician planted a bomb together or ? 
  whenever i see * british empire * , * india * , * colonial legacy * and things like that , the first thought is : `` i hope everything is fine with goa ... '', 
  yes , indeed , i have read it ( some years ago ... ) about being made by monks/priests too . 
  well technically it 's a portuguese word , forms of the verb `` sangrar '' , but of course not in this case . 
  ** `` beati hispani quibus vivere est bibere '' ** ( happy are the iberians for whom living is drinking ) ... in some regions of the iberian peninsula there 's ( even nowadays ) a linguistic phenomenon called [ betacism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betacism ) where people read `` v '' instead of `` b '' , so `` bibere '' ( drinking in latin ) becomes `` vivere '' ( living in latin ), 
  you proved no claim at all , you said that the debt was 129 and climbing however it has already declined between 2014 and 2015 and the forecast points that 's going to decline in the next years too . 
  then you said portuguese pm should learn with dijsselbloem since he reduced the debt from 66,4 to 65,1 , you only forgot to mention that between those numbers the debt also reached 68,2 , while the pm that `` should be learning '' from him is reducing the portuguese debt since the beginning ( 2015 ) plus , the ignorant talk , at first i thought `` he misspelled * sangria * it 's more associated with spain , but ok ... '' but no !, 
  `` sangre de toro '' , a spanish wine . 
   preferably short . 
  but only because he was measured with something different than * meter * and 200 years late people would say : `` til newpoleon bonaporte actually was n't short but normal size for his time '', 
  but ... he is from franco 's land , the germans were friend with franco, 
  stop !, 
  we 're poor , we need that money !, 
  both ? 
  ... polish is a slavic language , and portuguese while a romance language is often said to sound like `` russian '' . 
  i read every table from bottom to top , that way we always perform good , 
  and there 's no european union without eu e tu , 
  they 're outperforming in terms of value , but probably not in terms of clients . 
  the `` 1 % '' is getting richer so they can afford more high-brand products , but for the public in general the reality is a bit different, 
  i was giving 2 completely different words ( without really looking at prices ) to pinpoint exactly why zara is growing during crisis , while gucci is focused in a * saudi oil sheik * , zara have stuff for the `` regular '' citizen , and while in other times some middle class people would ask for loans and buy a gucci product once in a while ( or at least for their marriage and important days ) nowadays they do n't do that . 
  it was just that i was trying to say ... 
  i was just saying random prices . 
  but take notice that you can easily afford shirts in common mall stores for around 10 $ in portugal and even cheaper ones . 
  for instance , nike/adidas shoes are around 60 $ . 
  however like you said gucci is more like ~ 500 $ , but i think here you can find some stuff at `` lower '' prices ( in comparison with us ), 
   poland  portugal both have high emigration rates , * poor * economies when compared to `` central '' europe and speak slavic . 
  they bought brands all around the world and , plus , they 're sponsors of champions league , libertadores and several other stuff, 
  * barroso, 
  you mean the store in itself our the clothes that they sell ? 
  at least in portugal they have clothes from around ~ 10 $ while in a gucci and other * high brands * it 's ~ 20 $ and up . 
  but in the end of the day they would have sold 10 shirts and got 100 $ while gucci sold 4 and made 80 $ . 
  germany will found an upgrade version of eu with france and uk . 
  which of course uk will later rebrexit . 
  basque * country * will forever be the almost-a-country-but-not-yet, 
  gibraltar will get independence and then join the eu . 
  of course . 
  and a few years later ... [ eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5q2zqxk.png ), 
  at least here it 's seems like they grow specially during the crisis , i think it 's due to their type of selling , they have `` low '' prices and sell their products kind like it 's a street fair and so the common people feel that they 're more * friendly * / approachable and this means that it 's also easier for them to get inside a zara store than say a gucci or dior where it feels you need to be a high class noble to walk around their stores . 
  we passed that syndrome to the french :p, 
   greece ( ... ) and it introduced the euro in 2002 * phew ... * for a moment there i almost had an heart attack ~ ~ euro 2004 did n't happen ~ ~, 
  - red - * actual * possessions - pink - claims of sovereignty - orange - areas of influence and trade - green - trading posts - olive - areas of exploration - blue - main sea explorations , routes and areas of influence, 
  in 1448 , maciot de b\u00e9thencourt , who was the landlord of lanzarote and by extension of all the canary islands sold those territories to prince henry ( the navigator ) and while neither the natives nor the castilians accepted that action it was recognized by the pope nicholas v. soon a revolt began and in 1459 the portuguese had been ride out of archipelago ; finally in 1479 the [ treaty of alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_alc%c3%a1%c3%a7ovas ) was signed which granted those islands definitively for the castilian crown . 
  as for the key : - red - * actual * possessions - pink - claims of sovereignty - orange - areas of influence and trade - green - trading posts - olive - areas of exploration - blue - main sea explorations , routes and areas of influence, 
  the roman invasion of hispania ( iberia ) was done during a time where that territory was * just * a bunch of different tribes ( and many would even prefer to fight against each other than against the romans ) , bigger ones like the lusitani gave quite a fight to the roman troops . 
  later the vandals , suebis and visigoths invaded hispania when the roman empire was collapsing and this specific part of the empire was just farmers and a bunch of retired old war veterans . 
  and in fact , at least in a first moment the arabs arrived in the iberian peninsula not as invaders but as allies . 
  with the death of wittiza , a civil war began between roderic and achila ii . 
  achila requested the help of the muslim caliph al-walid i , roderic was defeated , but soon the remaining visigoths ended up seeing themselves side by side with a completely different civilization quite developed ( for their times ) , and while the barbarians have a reputation of being blood cruel warriors at this point in iberia the visigoths are mostly concerned with legislation ( in fact many laws and principles from nowadays portugal and i think spain too are from the visigoth times and not the romans ) but in 16th century , this was a completely different story . 
  while the ottoman empire was indeed as super power conquering the iberian peninsula would mean defeat also 2 great powers of that time , two empires that stretched all around the world , plus with the help of england and i 'm quite sure that france would n't be happy to have the ottomans at their doors neither . 
  napoleon biggest error was invading iberia . 
  it was mainly to get his ego up ( since portugal refused is continental blockade against the british ) , he ended up defeated in iberia and worst of all the british came to the rescue of portugal , and ironically , wellesley ( duke of wellington ) who was sailing to south america to help the venezuelan francisco de miranda fight the spaniards he ended up in iberia fighting alongside them and 7 years later there he was defeating napoleon in the battle of waterloo , and in all that time portugal was never under direct rule of the french and even managed to conquer french guyana ( which was returned to them later after the war ended ), 
  * olive * are areas of exploration . 
  in those places there was n't any real portuguese settlement however they would trade , gather food or resources in those places . 
  in this particular case of greenland it was mostly for fishery ( same for newfoundland and labrador ), 
  gibraltar is `` in '' uk . 
  but yeah , it 's kind of a big stretch since the population of gibraltar is mainly descendant from british people and not iberian natives . 
   we gave to the world the god looking brazilians , so ... we 're free of accusations , right ? 
  many years being the windshield of spain .

  i think it was fine, 
  i doubt it . 
  not even spaniards are spread out spain , let alone any group of foreigners ...

  indeed , but there are * many * americans so if they all use fossil fuels then what is excepted to happen is more climate change , either usa as a whole is a world power or not . 
  look , i could go take a piss on the beach now and * maybe * it could reach america and i 'm just a tiny little speck in a big universe , now imagine all the chinese people doing it . 
  but the important question to ask is `` who is batman ? '',
