  but in the end what does it matter for the common people ? 
   the general sucked in his breath and smiled . 
  `` i congratulate you , '' he said . 
  `` you have won the game . '', 
   rainsford did not smile . 
  `` i am still a beast at bay , '' he said , in a low , hoarse voice . 
  `` get ready , general zaroff . '', 
  [ the most dangerous game - richard connell ] ( http://fiction.eserver.org/short/the_most_dangerous_game.html/document_view ), 
  they 're descendants from the [ padeira de aljubarrota ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota#aftermath ) and [ duarte pacheco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cochin_%281504%29#rewards_of_duarte_pacheco ) . 
  so 4 men x 7 x 19000 = 53200 spanish moors . 
  not tremendous . 
  huge !, 
  so 2 non-countries ( * official * ) : iraqi kurdistan and palestine . 
  1 usa * ally * : saudi arabia . 
  2 * small * countries : qatar and kuwait . 
  1 country that is probably the most christian from all middle-east : lebanon - indeed a good choice of allies . 
  where is erdogan going to signed the surrender treaty ? 
  fortunately it 's just gibberish talk but i still feel sorry for all the turks that got to see this happening , a country with such a rich culture and history , the door between two worlds being governed by this kind of ~ ~ democracy ~ ~ idiocracy is n't what the turks ( or anyone ) deserve . 
  they call it oporto like we say londres instead of london . 
  and while it may have began with an * error * the same could be said for example for river guadiana , the roman name was flumen anas ( flumen means river ) later the arabs called it u\u00e1di ana ( u\u00e1di means river ) from that evolved into ouadiana and then guadiana , but ... like you can see the guadi part basically meant river , so it 's like saying `` river river of ducks '', 
  ... and that comment was downvoted just as i excepted, 
   ( i knew the existence of olivenza through this forum ) . 
  that 's because it 's kind of a running gag for us here , rest assure that 97 % of the portuguese probably also do n't know about ~ ~ olivenza ~ ~ ~ oliven\u00e7a :d, 
  also cape verde , guinea bissau and s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and principe . 
  lagos , the most populated city in nigeria means `` lakes '' in portuguese and there 's also a city with that same name in portugal , and there are some words used in native nigerian languages that are derived from portuguese too , 
  no problem we 're always happy to receive you in our country  you fuckin ' shithead !!, 
  we hate you , my lovely friend , 
  yeah , i understood what you said just saying that perhaps some people got mislead by that ... 
  a\u1e45grez\u012b ( english ) , an\u0101n\u0101s ( pineapple ) , aspat\u0101l ( hospital ) , isp\u0101t ( steel - from espada ( sword ) ) , kamr\u0101 ( room/chamber ) , k\u0101j\u016b ( cashew ) , kr\u016bs ( crucifix/cross ) , girj\u0101 ( church ) , m\u0101rtol ( hammer ) , tamb\u0101ku ( tobacco ) , ... 
  maybe it 's because he said `` african slave trade '' instead of `` atlantic slave trade '' , i mean , the slavery in africa did n't began with the portuguese , in fact during the reconquista , iberians would be sold as slaves in africa by their muslims * lords * , and after the * portuguese * reconquista slavery keep on going in africa for centuries without any portuguese ( or european intervention ) . 
   ter\u00e7os do you mean that religious thing ? 
  1 - we just do n't care . 
  it 's that laziness thing of ours . 
  and of course we 're better than the british , the french and most of all the spanish !, 
  2 - we do n't think that , actually we got admired that so many people think our country is * good * when we 're the first ones to point out errors in it . 
  we like brazilians and i 'm quite sure they like us ( even if that does n't seem in youtube comments ... ) and we also have a fairly good relation with people from our african former colonies and i 'm quite sure portuguese would give hands and sing again for the liberation of timor leste if that was needed . 
   portuguese food is bland that 's why we got into india , to get the spices :d, 
  oh ok , i thought the main ingredient was always plum, 
  it 's actually moloto * f * . 
  the origin of the name came from the battle of malakoff , during the crimean war , and so the dessert was called pudim malakof ( f ) ( malakof pudding ) in the beginning , however this recipe became more popular in the 50s ( 1950 ) when another eastern name came into the portuguese hears , molotov , so the names kind of merged and now is pudim `` molotof '' ( molotof pudding ), 
  so any of them knows how to do a `` punheta de bacalhau '' ? 
   also the explorer 's name was fern\u00c3o de magalh\u00c3es , not fucking `` ferdinand magellan '' . 
  trist * an * makes it look like it was a spaniard that discovered the island . 
  well , we once had a fascist government . 
  we expelled and burned jews `` like the nazis '' at some point . 
  and we also killed many muslims . 
  so palinka is mainly made with plum , while ginjinha is made with sour cherry , both fruits from the genus * prunus * , so they 're like `` cousin '' drinks , 
  ah yeah , i get it , yup , it may get you a little of nausea since is made of `` cherry '' . 
  there are various types of aguardente , the most common one in portugal is called [ `` baga\u00e7o '' ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/01/fd/dc/01fddc68f5c76d4a9d1ab4f93a1f2594.jpg ) ( it 's that `` water '' thing at the side of the cup of coffee ) people usually drink it after the coffee and some even mix it with coffee ( `` caf\u00e9 com cheirinho '' aka `` coffee with a little smell '' ) . 
  the abv ( alcohol by volume ) of this drink is usually between 35\u00ba and 54\u00ba , while for comparison the one that you had ( ginjinha ) is around 20\u00ba ( in a cup of the same size , and sometimes even smaller ), 
  lu\u00eds figo , and yes , he 's highly regard . 
  after him it 's probably rui costa and deco , paulo futre too . 
  but those are just opinions and there is n't 100 % agreement , probably not even 10 % , ahahah, 
  you should try aguardente . 
  2nd is ronaldo and 3rd eus\u00e9bio . 
  so top 3 portuguese are all from africa :d, 
  we sent the tea from east asia to portugal , then from portugal to england and you sent it from england to north america . 
  but americans did n't liked it and spilled out the cargo . 
  later those same americans sent an atomic bomb into nagasaki ( a former portuguese trade port ) probably like saying `` this is because of pearl harbor ... and the fuckin ' tea ! '', 
  we 're the berlusconis of food , we love to eat some `` little french girls '', 
  unfortunately there are `` graves '' in every religion and sect , just because we do n't see the virus with our eyes does n't mean it is n't real , and sadly as the time passes by we find more horrors each day in everyplace from everyone, 
  yes , indeed , 10-20 years ago , quite a few teenagers would try and even smoke weed sometimes because it was `` cool '' , they 're being rebel , nowadays they 're like `` weed ? 
  yeah , i know , the official languages in galicia/galiza are spanish ( castilian ) and galician , however like i said apparently for the european parliament they kind of consider the galician to be a portuguese dialect , i was just giving that bit of `` trivia '' , 
  at least in the `` european union '' context portuguese should be also `` partially spain '' the galicians deputies in the european parliament wanted to speak in galician , whoever spain did n't approved that and neither the european union recognized it . 
  so they simply said that they 're actually speaking a portuguese `` dialect '' and portugal was like `` hum ... ok , bro '', 
   france -  italy -  balkans -  asia minor -  middle east -  ... ? 
  -  india in the middle east and many parts of africa , europeans are called franks ~ since the roman times . 
  so in the case of india it was `` probably '' introduced by the portuguese ( just like in japan ) and since they 're europeans they called it `` frankish disease '' ( european disease ), 
  at the time it was probably more associated with macau than hong kong, 
  yes , the `` sh '' sound . 
  i think it 's mainly from viseu , but probably you can hear it all around northeast portugal, 
  in some areas of portugal people say the `` j '' ( and so also the `` g '' in `` ge '' and `` gi '' ) as a `` x '' , so instead of reading `` girafa '' they read it as `` xirafa '', 
  jewish people from the 15th/16th either converted into christianity or leaaved into netherlands , turkey or even the new world . 
  during the 2nd world war portugal received quite a few jews but it was mainly used as a bridge into usa ( specially because portugal was under a dictatorship at the time ), 
  the northern spanish colony ? 
  yeah ... but * they * 're chinese . 
  correct , just pointing out that * nowadays * we write `` ingl\u00eas '', 
  putaoya is n't a different pronunciation of portugal but rather a different word/etymology which means something like `` grape teeth '' . 
  portuguese arrived in china as explorers and merchants and the most common beverage at board of the ships was wine ( port , madeira , ... ) which probably caused their teeth to be grape coloured ( specially compared with all the civilizations that china had seen till then ), 
  yeah , i know , ahahah , i was saying the meaning of the words in chinese, 
  if i 'm not mistaken it means something like `` grape teeth '' , the japanese and korean are obviously just different ways of pronouncing portugal, 
  i would love to see you say that as a kosovar , as a east timorese before 2002 , as a former soviet union citizen or any other . 
  indeed the world should leave in peace , and there should be no walls between us , but it 's also a right to fight for our nation , to fight for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedom !, 
  oh ok , close enough xd, 
  i 'm still waiting for portugalicia, 
  portuguese descendant ? 
  indeed . 
  ** fdp ** is * filho da puta * ( son of a whore - used to insult someone ) and ** pqp ** is * puta que pariu * ( something like `` whore that gave birth '' - used as kind of a interjection , to show despise through something , that you are n't happy with something ), 
  or pqp !, 
  how do you say caralho in luxembourgish ? 
  start in eastern germany then go east into poland , then to russia , all the way into the strait of bering , then ignore that continental mass called usa ( they 're west !, 
  ) , travel east across the atlantic ocean , and finally you have reached the most eastern nation of europe , portugal . 
  purple is n't more of a thing associated with roman emperors ? 
  i thought `` blue blood '' was kind of * global * term of nobility , but perhaps it 's more associated/used with/in iberia ( sangre/sangue azul ), 
  the '' \u00fc '' was used in words like * ling\u00fci\u00e7a * , right ? 
  since when ? 
  in most places left is associated with communism ( red ) and right is associated with royalty ( blue ), 
  specially during summertimes in algarve  , 
  i mean if you 're close to the ocean and go 500km west you surely wo n't find any civilization ... and well neither if you go 500km east near the border with spain ( if you go north you will find some mystical portuguese elfs called galicians ), 
  i 'm no musician ... it 's a guitar and it 's in a street of portugal , so ... a portuguese guitar !,
