  / s but really ... what 's that called ? 
  yes . 
  paving ( pedestrian areas ) in portugal began in the beggining of the 16th century ... due to a white rhinoceros ( his huge * paws * would stomp on the terrain and get dirty everyone around during the procession/courtship in honour of king manuel i so they paved all that road to avoid that ) , at the time they used granite . 
  2 centuries later , the 1755 earthquake destroyed great part of lisbon including that old paved street , however the reconstruction of lisbon was made in a rational way , and so money was n't applied in such thing as streets with `` portuguese pavement '' in the middle of the 19th century the `` portuguese pavement '' would appear as we know it nowadays , with limestone , where later basalt was also added in order to create patterns and figures , mainly related to portuguese discoveries . 
  from portugal it spread into his colonies and more recently even to some others countries . 
  are n't we all ? 
  of course not !, 
  they 're ...  ... all * holanda * on this blessed day, 
  cape verde one are n't exactly waves but that was the best i could find . 
  portuguese pavement , * cal\u00e7ada portuguesa * , is a type of pavement used for many pedestrian areas mainly in portugal ( where it originated ) . 
  the patterns are usually waves , with some symbols also related to the sea , such as [ octopi ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_t4utzqzideg/s6cfwb6hu3i/aaaaaaaabgg/pl7jwlajil8/s400/lagos+art+history+artistic+guide+portuguese+pavement+lisbon+tour+portugal+city+roc2c+restaurant+hotel+limestone+pattern+curve+resort+famous+pavement+aquarium+octopus.jpg ) , [ sea horses ] ( http://www.adventureflair.com/advent/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jzwbaaxxfvfh3.jpg ) or [ boats ] ( https://cdn.travel2next.com/wp-content/uploads/macau-112.jpg ) and also many other things , like a [ fado singer ( am\u00e1lia ) ] ( http://www.lisbonlux.com/images/magazine/calcada-amalia-rodrigues.jpg ) and [ portuguese guitar ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b1/0f/98/b10f981fad6489cbaf71d77b4005a3d9.jpg ) , a [ queen/saint ] ( http://zinatours.com/imagens/photosgallery/gallery37/hr/coimbra-7.jpg ) , and again the [ waves ... around a big world map ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ntohih0zhe/tb7ct25g8mi/aaaaaaaadfo/yvonwvniqgw/s1600/lagos%2bart%2bhistory%2bartistic%2bportuguese%2bpavement%2blisbon%2bcity%2broc2c%2bpeople%2blimestone%2bcal%25c3%25a7ada%2bportuguesa%2bportugal%2b%25e8%2591%25a1%25e8%2590%2584%25e7%2589%2599%2b%25e8%2591%25a1%25e8%2590%2584%25e7%2589%2599%25e8%25b7%25af%25e9%259d%25a2%2b%25e9%2587%258c%25e6%2596%25af%25e6%259c%25ac%2bcompass%2bcard%2bmonument%2bto%2bthe%2bdiscoveries%2bbelem%2bdetails%2bmap.jpg ), 
  not all of them , some are canarians, 
  just wait till brasil is ours once again !, 
   ceuta * back to portugal , 
  why do you need vodka when you 've wine ? 
  again ... knife ? 
  pfff , we use our hands to kill , cut and even to fuc * ing put the butter on the bread !, 
  3 . who needs a sauna when we 've sun all around the year ? 
  i will speak for the case of portugal . 
  since 1974 the government have been alternating between psd ( center right ) and ps ( center left ) , and sometimes they have also made colligations with parties slightly to the `` right '' or to the `` left '' but in none of the cases they have made a partnership with a * far * - left/right , but i guess * far * kind of depends from each others perspective, 
  maybe on paper , but i mean portugal has a socialist party in charge and it 's not like children are getting taught the soviet anthem in schools ... 
  it 's not like people in portugal or spain are voting that `` fervently '' in communist parties ... sure the left parties have grown in iberia but it 's mostly the `` new wave '' of left wing parties , whose i would n't call `` communist '' per se, 
   constantly it was one time and 2 ^ ^ nd place in that poll was a historical portuguese communist leader , beside that it was n't a census or something like that but people calling into the tv show , basically it was `` derby '' between far-right people and far-left , the ones that usually make quiet the noise in facebook but in the end represent ~ 1 % during * real * elections, 
  show some respect , you 're talking with ronaldo `` o fen\u00f3meno '' !, 
  usa and soviet union supported different factions , which would later lead to a civil war between them after portugal gave angola independence, 
  in africa since 1914 in the border between angola/namibia and mozambique/tanzania , and later , in 1917 , helping also in france, 
  roman empire was cleaner at its boarders ( portugal -- romania ), 
  it 's the eurovision of fashion . 
  why is n't portugal in this miss europe map ? 
  never realized that so many eu countries got their gas from russia , here in the iberian corner the gas comes from algeria , and if i 'm not mistaken i think italy also gets some of their gas from algeria edit : and at least for portugal , in terms of oil , the top 3 countries that we import from are angola , saudi arabia and algeria ( data from 2014 ) , followed by azerbaijan , kazakhstan , nigeria , congo and uk . 
  i saw the picture 1 and was like `` oh ... ok , we 're 2 ^ ^ nd and greece is first '' , then i moved on to pic 2 , `` ah , right ... 2 ^ ^ nd place again and greece is fir ... wait , where is greece ? 
  last ? 
  what the hell ?! '', 
  the growth in andaluc\u00eda is n't due to the fact that they 've a * small * population however they 're `` receiving '' every year several expats from britain ? 
  so what 's the difference ... beside the temporal one ? 
  ( no sarcasm , it 's a true question ), 
  indeed it may be `` fishy '' and * we * know that , but it 's always fun to see that the ones pointing `` right away '' the errors are usually people * not * from the countries in question . 
  a bit like when we see an `` education '' statistic and many eastern european countries do better than us and * some * of us are like `` who is that possible ? 
  they 're poorer than us ... bla bla bla '', 
   my opinion is , like yours , that greece and turkey have nothing to do in cyprus , but it 's a very complicated situation . 
   cypriots were hellenized centuries ago and that led to them calling themselves `` greeks '' . 
  they were also part of the byzantine empire so yeah , they have common history with greece too . 
  i understand that , but it 's seems a bit like portugal and spain suddenly arguing about uruguay just because 2 centuries ago they 're also disputing the territory and so there maybe some descendants there nowadays too ...  it 's always nationalists , they are the ones who must read this indeed , unfortunately must of the times they 're completely * blind *  i did n't jump into extremism and i completely agree with what you said yeah , i know and like i said somewhere in text `` i 'm not saying it 's your case '' . 
  it 's always funny to see statistics in / r/europe when poor countries do * better * than the usual richer ones . 
  there are less suicides in southern europe ? 
  `` it 's the sun !, 
  our healthcare is better !, 
  lucky bastards and their sun ! '', 
  some statistics says that people from southern europe are friendlier ... `` i 'm freezing up here , it 's not my fault ! '', 
  but suddenly appears a statistic saying that dutch and germans travel more with bicycle than spaniards , portuguese , italians and greeks : `` ahahah those lazy * pigs * they ca n't even take a walk on their bikes , ahahah '' without even realizing that those f ** ckin ' countries are mostly made of hills , while netherlands is a flat country like maria leal . 
   what they did in cyprus is of course unacceptable i will never understand what the f * ck does greece and turkey have to do with cyprus , i 'm far away and i no nothing about their politics , but is n't cyprus a sovereign country ? 
  yeah , your grand-grand-grand-father may have descendants in cyprus , some people their speak greek , others turkish , and so does a brazilian speaks portuguese . 
  for god sake , i 'm not saying it 's your case , but people from the balkans and eastern mediterranean need to chill out a bit , enjoy the sun and the beaches , live your live and let live , is that important a piece of land ? 
  yes , we should all love our countries but lets not jump into extremisms , your house and our world is a better place without them . 
  ( ... )  para nascer , portugal , para morrer , o mundo '' - ant\u00f3nio vieira ( `` born small and die great , is to become a man . 
  ( ... ) to be born , portugal ; to die , the world . '' ), 
  the main difference between the holocaust and other genocides is the public awareness of it . 
  it had a huge number of deaths , perhaps one of the deadliest genocides ever , but still , knowing it wo n't dry the tears from the face of sudanese widow or make the parents of an orphan child from nigeria reappear . 
  statistics are nice to see and compare , but in an human level we tend to suffer and relate easier to things closer to us . 
  plus , in many caf\u00e9s at least in villages if you ask for it they give you a free cup of * aguardente * , and of course in several cases there 's a little candy at the side of the coffee cup, 
  in your case you do n't need to break it , just speak spanish with your russian accent and it will seem like portuguese , 
  i thought we 're friends :'(, 
  and a tomato shaped like ... 1/6 tomato, 
  careful fat friend , do n't spill your diet coke into the keyboard and watch out for the burger , that ketchup may stain your `` american flag '' shirt , 
  besides , the eu was created mainly to avoid wars between the european countries . 
  plus , i 'm portuguese , and one thing is for sure , no empire or global power lasts forever , your so beloved country used spanish coins at the beginning , the founding fathers of usa toasted several times with portuguese wine and fought a war against the british with the help of the french . 
  200 years ago portugal was an global power from south america to east asia . 
  rome was once an empire but now is only a city and carthage is no more . 
  at least europe is developing in human rights , taking steps through green energy , etc. . . in the future when people stop using oil what 's more going to be of united states than the simple ashes of a bright past ? 
  i used quotes because i was ... you know ... 
  quoting a word that you used . 
  in europe when we say `` heritage '' we are n't talking about 1700 's migrants from ireland and neither 1/32 cherokee ancestry . 
  his * grandfather * was an indian from goa ( at the time portuguese territory ) , plus he did n't simply showed up in india wearing that outfit it was given to him by the indian people in signal of respect and good relation , which also symbolizes our relation as state with india and with most nations in general , this is , of co-operation and good terms . 
  what happened between 2014 and 2015 ? 
  when they say 14 vowels it 's actually related to the phonology and the number of ways you can say all the vowels , for instance while there 's `` a '' , you can use it as `` a '' , '' \u00c0 '' , '' \u00c3 '' , etc. . . and every different `` sound '' is regard as being a different vowel, 
  portugal was occupied by france but not ruled by them . 
  portugal was ruled by `` spain '' but not occupied by them . 
  you 're probably talking about hispania the latin name for iberia . 
  a common mistake . 
  i 'm not . 
  thank you . 
  just to prevent some german to say that we 're lazy , we work 10 hours , sleep 10 and party at least 8 . 
  oh ok , good guy putin then . 
  yup , it was very popular . 
  in portugal we made our own version called `` inspector max '' , between 2004-05 with reruns basically every year , and now suddenly , 11 years later , they announced a 3 ^ ^ rd season . 
  all of iberia is painted . 
  the pineapples are from azores , portugal , 
  if spaniards are like the portuguese in terms of being late then juan carlos probably thought `` 20min late ?!, 
  dammit , i said 14pm but was only excepting for everybody to arrive at 15pm ... where am i going to find some good paella now ? '', 
  should n't there be a bit of `` portugal '' in there too ? 
  * destroyer of malacca *, 
  it 's a , it 's a , it 's a , it 's a sin !, 
  fado ,, 
   monaco vatican is like 200 % right ? 
  do you really think our galician bros are going to meme against us ? 
  `` the spice must flow '', 
  the main reason we do n't conquer castile is because worse than have them as neighbors is to have the french, 
   dragon technically that 's not a * dragon * but rather a `` serpe '' or in english a * wyvern '' . 
  a dragon as 4 members , while a wyvern as only 2 . 
  they 're all over portuguese history , from coats of arms to the sceptre of the brazilian emperor , from portuguese card decks to the coat of arms of english queen consort catherine of braganza .
