  '' * dog 's area * '' does n't count , you basically live in africa . 
  have you ever left your country ? 
  just take the train to cyprus and you 'll be surprised . 
  `` choose your language ... '' * portuguese *, 
  richtugal, 
  you can say bacalhau , bacalhao , bacalhav , 84c4lh4u , whatever , but you need to put `` caralho '' in the end so we know that you 're speaking of a portuguese dish, 
  his second voyage was much more * fun *  during his second voyage to calicut , da gama intercepted a ship of muslim pilgrims , travelling from calicut to mecca . 
  described in detail by a eyewitness and a chronicler g , da gama looted the ship with over 400 pilgrims on board including 50 women , locked in the passengers , the owner and an ambassador from egypt and burned them to death . 
  they offered their wealth , which `` could ransom all the christian slaves in the kingdom of fez and much more '' but were not spared . 
  da gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy . 
   after demanding the expulsion of muslims from calicut to the hindu zamorin , the latter sent the high priest for talks . 
  da gama called him a spy , ordered the priests ' lips and ears to be cut off and after sewing a pair of dog 's ears to his head , sent him away . 
  hugo is such a troll, 
  i have a maria and a hugo in my family . 
  i feel ashamed . 
  i would say that i have an average of at least a glass of wine per day . 
  then of course the usual beer , some aguardente , some liqueurs , stuff like that . 
  wait , there 's a albania bordering iberia , and neither one is `` albania '' or the iberian peninsula ... amazing !, 
   \u0130 you made me scratch my computer screen ... 
  im\u0101rah qur\u1e6duba , qa\u1e0d\u012bb !, 
   blow up the eifel tower pheeew ... for a moment i thought it could blow up the eiffel tower . 
  the flag of lisbon is related with saint vicente of saragossa , the saint died in 4th century in valencia after being severely tortured and his body was thrown in the coast of portugal on what is now the cape of saint vicente , and according to the legend his body was protected by ravens who prevented other wild animals of eating him . 
  later in the 12th century , afonso i of portugal exhumed the saint to lisbon , and while on the voyage , made by boat , some ravens were accompanying it . 
  that became a symbol to the newly formed christian kingdom and so adopted by its capital . 
  plus , the black and white background is the same used in the spanish city of ceuta . 
  `` reinos cristianos '' . 
  cristiano ronaldo rightful ruler of iberia !, 
  r/trains ? 
  r/locomotives ? 
  worst position of all `` industrialized countries '' . 
  but then again , if you go to rural areas many older people know french since they worked/lived there when they 're young . 
  i wo n't doubt our number however , i 'm just a bit sceptic about france being ahead of us , their english is probably equal to ours , some of them may learn german , just like some of us may learn spanish , but then we have the french , while they learn/speak what ? 
  are they considering corsican or something like that ? 
  did i said that ? 
  i wad just saying that the media attention is n't related to that . 
  30 ( +28 ) dead in the grenfell tower , while this one is on a death count of 60, 
  reddit is a `` american '' oriented site , and the main concern for the american average people/news were terrorism related issues . 
  so natural disasters end up * undercover * , if it was a forest fire in london it probably would 've happen something similar ( of course it more awareness because it 's london ... ) , but since it was a building in london perhaps many of them thought `` was that a terrorist attack ? '', 
  beira interior, 
  you should be forbidden of eating cod fish , caralho !, 
  it 's raining right now here where i am . 
  as for leaving the country , i 'm portuguese , here people do n't mind leaving , it 's something normal to happen since ever at least in the `` interior '' , for most parts portugal is a desert of human life and within a few more decades all that his going to left were some cities ij the coast populated by a spectrum of multicultural people , nothing wrong about that bit , but sometimes it saddens me to think that people would rather live in like a fish in an aquarium just because they have someone giving them food than be free to swim in the ocean despite all the dangers . 
  there once was guy that lived in a small house , nearby there was a huge palace where they would eat good shrimp , caviar , etc. . . and the man though `` my life is miserable , i ca n't live no more '' and so he decided to suicide and jump of a bridge , but as he walked into the bridge he so a homeless man , shirtless sleeping on a bench , and right next to him a whole family in similar conditions and so he looked back and smiled at his `` palace '' . 
  if there are 200 countries in the world , then italy is for sure in the top 20 , of course we should always look for improvement but so do germany , uk and france . 
  you know that movie with danny devito and arnold schwarzenegger ? 
  we 're devito , the older but smaller brother, 
  and so did french when usa was fighting for independence , and so did many european countries that helped and still help usa in missions and wars overboard . 
  should we europeans forever be thankful for their help in ww ii ... well , maybe , but that does n't mean we should adopt all their ideas and neither follow them everywhere . 
  sometimes we 're more similar with americans , others with the chinese or even the russians , we are europeans , but also a bunch of different countries , each with it 's own different traits . 
  galicia is already semi-portuguese , extremadura is celebrating the 10 ^ ^ th of june ( portugal 's day ) since 2013 . 
  we 're slowly conquering spain . 
  next step is unite algarve and andalusia , both sides have beaches packed with brits and germans . 
  `` concordata '' , we signed it here too . 
  almost  it 's sailing this month to santos ( in state of s\u00e3o paulo ), 
  correction : the ship * is * going to santos ** this month ** , between 15/06 ( around 9am , local hours ) and will stay until 18/06 ( 10am ) , visits aboard are free between 10am and 12am of 16/06 and 10am and 2pm of 17/06 . 
  yes , according to the source it was sailing to santos ( s\u00e3o paulo ), 
  not even salazar, 
  and if the timeline kept going ... salazar would still be the prime minister till 1968 when due to health problems he was changed for marcello caetano, 
  f u t e b o l , c a r a l h o !, 
  where is the little bit of red , white and blue in the corner ? 
  abacaxi and anan\u00e1s are for all that matters the same fruit , usually they ( the supermarkets ) label as `` abacaxi '' the ones coming from brazil ( and probably other places of south america ) , while `` anan\u00e1s '' os the one coming from azores ( and probably other places ) , and indeed the first one is sweeter than the other , but despite that i would say that the majority of the people still calls it anan\u00e1s but it may change between regions, 
  ... are n't you thinking of brazil ? 
  ah so that 's where my missing [ cards ] ( http://cdn-3.unorules.com/http:/unorules.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/uno-cards.jpg ) went . 
  we 're connected by carracks with the world !, 
  beat that laudrup !, 
  in mirandese ( the green area in northeast portugal ) they say ma\u00e7ana , not pom . 
  plus , a group of apple trees in portuguese is called `` pomar '', 
  named after the roman * dictator * j caesar, 
  followed by ju, 
  elohim , god on high , can you hear your people cry ? 
  help us now !, 
  just wait till they have to face ra , mut , nut , khnum , ptah , nephthys , nekhbet , sobek , sekhment , sokar , selket , reshpu , wadjet , anubis , anukis , seshmu , meshkent , hemsut , tefnut , heket and mafdet , and play with the big boys, 
  this picture is called `` chafariz d'el rey '' ( king 's fountain ) , in the back you can see some animal stone heads * spitting * water , where people would go get it ( the water ) with their clay pots . 
  so must probably that person dropped the pot on its own head and it broke ( those are n't tomatoes but rather broken pieces of the clay pot ), 
  santiago order was pretty popular in portugal too , and since spain had n't sub-saharan colonies at this time ( guinea equatorial is from xviii century ) i would say that the knight is probably portuguese . 
  but , well , one thing is for sure he is an african-iberian * order of santiago, 
  caralho is n't racist , it cames in every colors and shapes, 
  if you read with more attention you would see i was joking too ... i would guess that by the time i mentioned `` fuckin ' '' and `` berlusconi '' people would get that , i was just randomly ranting in order to then give more impact to the * stereotypical * joke that british food is indeed bad, 
  this is / r/europe ... in european terms uk has a lots of immigrants , do n't you agree ? 
  we ca n't really compare with any american country ... 
  and neither is the us for that matter ... but when we think of the usa we think of new york , los angeles and cities like that , if we go to utah or south dakota while many people can have some * distant * relative from germany they 're not immigrants . 
  same happens in uk , of course rural areas were n't made of immigrants , but what about london and other cities ? 
  and london surely is influential in the panorama of uk . 
  but you 're saying that like it 's a bad ... maybe i 'm just interpreting your comment the wrong way , but the british empire ... the roman empire , if there was a thing that made them the * greatest * of their times was their way of interacting with foreigners , with the peoples they had conquest , they way the knew how to adapt ... 
   fish , chips fish and chips was introduced by jews  cup o ' tea the habit of drinking tea was introduced by a portuguese queen  worse weather obviously influenced by northern france  mary fuckin ' poppins fuckin ' ? 
  that surely has something to do with berlusconi , former italian president  bad food okay , that 's purely british . 
  the portuguese royalty minority that introduced the tea drinking habit ? 
  the jews minority that introduced the fish n ' chips or the indians with tikka masala . 
  uk is made of immigrants , a world within a country of countries . 
  with the participation of portugal , italy , spain , yugoslavia and also san marino and macau .

  [ intro video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ddhaxqlgc ), 
  the big difference are the main expertizes of which country and that influences the productivity and what they produce the much , so while germans work less hours they 're working with metallurgy making cars , pieces for tanks , aeroplanes and computers , etc. . . while the portuguese and greece are working in factories producing textiles and making olive oil , in the end the wealth of a country ends being up fairly superior to the other . 
  and that 's why it 's important to have the european union , portugal and greece will never achieve the same wealth as germany simply because which country as its focus and in an union it 's better to have which one doing it 's expertise , just like in a football team , german is the goalkeeper saving eu from losing , portugal is the one making the outfits for the players and greece is the chef doing the meals for them , but in the end all the players , all the staff and all the people around were important to a well functioned eu, 
  a movie about a young man named alex that always arrives late to his meetings . 
  i 'm here just to say this :  hmm yeah , either kicked ass or then our poor infertile land with a few piss poor hunters just was n't worth visiting . 
  iceland , south korea , malawi , portugal and japan , here is a group of countries we do n't usually see put together, 
   portugal portugal is a founding member of nato , basically because while they 're neutral during ww2 they ceded an airbase in azores to the allies ( which is still today an [ american airbase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) ) spain only joined in 1982 when they 're already a democracy . 
  the 4 +1 * bestest * countries !,
