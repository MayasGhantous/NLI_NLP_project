  * high-five * , hermano !, 
  that and world wars . 
  we started in the morning drink wine during the mass with the pope , till afternoon , then we stopped to watch the game and after it we drank lots a lots of beer , either because we 're happy or sad . 
  i 'm sure [ nuno alvites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuno_alvites ) will choose a great squad for that world cup, 
   is there anything they ca n't do ? 
  painting it pink on a map ? 
  i think it means that if they need help they can always count with us, 
  the floor is laaavaaaaa !, 
  spain usually is really nice to us in eurovision ... 
  not at all !, 
  ... i mean , we 're presidents of europe . 
  monarchy was abolished in 1910 . 
  half of catalonia ... like the * spanish * half ? 
  but in that case they used their own version just like in portuguese we say `` s\u00e3o jorge '' ( saint george ) . 
  ^ ^ magalh\u00e3es ^ ^ in ^ ^ spanish ^ ^ is ^ ^ magallanes . 
  damn english people , we 're friends !, 
  but they always use the spanish version of names ... like * tristan * da cunha, 
  ceuta is probably too small to appear on the map ... 
  the thing is george washington is mostly talked for being the 1 ^ ^ st us president , while many of nowadays kids have heard of hitler as an internet meme . 
  neither is portugal or spain of course ... i was just making fun of a famous quote : `` africa begins beyond the pyrenees '' wrote by [ william ripley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_z._ripley ), 
  palau can finally * into relevance *, 
  and this is why iberia is in africa . 
   it 's too cold to fuck in fields here a lot of the year , though there are always cars i suppose the answer is you fuck in the fields , either inside the car or at least on top of the front of the car ( where the motor is , since it 's the warmer part of the car ... or in the rear , if the motor is there ) , plus always bring blankets in the car so you can have a softer floor, 
  i mean , the biggest difference is cultural , i live in a village of portugal , like 200 people , i 'm not yet 30 ( some more years till i reach that ... ) but certainly it is n't something that uncommon , specially because in this case there is no such a thing as `` renting a apartment '' unless you want to leave the place you have born ( which happens , people go to nearby cities , to the capital ( lisbon ) , etc. . . ) . 
  for drugs and sex , i mean , it 's a village , there are huge empty fields where you could all those things . 
  there are some 30s people living with their parents , and in the end , it kind is better for both sides , the `` 30s people '' were almost independent , they 've their works and contribute with money for the house , plus it 's always good to have someone younger in the house , while there are n't much case of robs or any similar things police ( security ) were also very rarely seen around , and the parents all they do is some meals , maybe clean some cloths and that 's it . 
  why ? 
  you still have no privacy at all , actually it 's even worst , yeah it 's cool because those were your friends , one week in vacation is good , two maybe , but months , years ... pubic hairs on the sink , loud sexy nights , unless you get really well with each other it 's most of the times a recipe to disaster, 
  they had to beat us on something ... ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ french ^ ^ people, 
  unfortunately lisbon is still in portugal ... ^ ^ / s, 
  what 's a portugese ? 
  that would be `` vai-te foder '' but yes , it can also be interpreted that way . 
  the right way would be `` adoro isto , caralho ! '', 
  not to be confused with `` adoro * este * caralho '', 
  yeah , sometimes it 's hard as * caralho * to get the right translation, 
  in the end of the semester they all offer a bottle of wine to the teacher, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ie7hr8fhhi&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m21s ), 
  ah ok , i thought you could n't see it even with the `` zoom in '' , but i get your point, 
  seriously speaking ... you ca n't read the words ? 
  they are readable to me and honestly i do n't see that well ... 
  it was * chant * popularised after portugal won the euro 2016 the translation is :  and it was \u00c9der that fucked them !, 
  ( \u00c9der scored the winning goal against france in the euro 2016 final ), 
  yup , basically that . 
  `` caralho '' can mean different things ...  o meu caralho \u00e9 maior que o teu !, 
  my * dick * is bigger than yours !, 
  what * the hell * are you doing ?!, 
  etc. . 
  dracula is latin . 
  in this case `` beers '' since it 's in the plural, 
  saying `` tremosos '' while not a legal thing to say is also decriminalized , you may have read about it on reddit some few times, 
  are n't there any catalan speakers remaining in pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-orientales ? 
  no , but you have to admit , it 's kind of funny . 
  what 's the situation of catalunya in the french side ? 
  so ... canada and australia are actually part of uk ? 
  or even better , canada , australia , northern ireland , scotland and wales are all england , since their ruler is queen elizabeth ii . 
  portugal and castille had different governments , their ships carried up different flags , and a more bunch of things , the only thing they shared was the monarch . 
  geographical speaking . 
  in terms of culture , its history and people it 's indeed european . 
  well ... cyprus . 
  in this last days we had been talking about liberty , free speech and things like that ; we live in europe , we should be free , but does it really happen ? 
  and i mean ... to everybody . 
  if you have any examples where your country ( govern , specially ) had disrespected the freedom of speech ( or anything related ) put it in the thread . 
  ps : sorry for the `` bed engrish '', 
  most of europe is already part of the european union and so the connection between all of us is increasing , he know more about the cultural of each other than ever before . 
  but , like the navigators discovered some centuries ago , there is a whole world outside of there . 
  however , there are many ties already made with countries outside of e.u. , for example united kingdom is part of the [ commonwealth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) and portugal is part of the [ cplp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_of_portuguese_language_countries ) , commonwealth itself as more than 50 countries/members , in which only 3 are part of eu ( uk , cyprus and malta ) and in cplp only one ( portugal ) , those cultural organizations are a good why to connect those countries with europe and the eu . 
  countries with former colonies like uk , portugal , spain , netherlands , ... can be , like before , the bridges between `` our '' world and the rest of the world . 
  do you think europe should promote those relationships in order to create `` bridges '' with the rest of the world or should they avoid those `` outside '' connections , specially in countries like uk where the euroscepticism is increasing ? 
  does your country have similar organizations ? 
  for example the ex-soviet countries with former soviet countries from asia . 
  tomorrow is the portuguese national day and it 's holiday to honor portugal , the portuguese community ( either in portugal or living aboard ) and to some extent in honor of all the portuguese speakers around the world . 
  the date also commemorates the death of the portuguese poet [ lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu%c3%ads_de_cam%c3%b5es ) who died in 10 june of 1580 . 
  so regarding all that , i decided to make a post about the portuguese culture . 
  - dance ... 
  despite being a small country portugal as some folk dances like : [ `` pauliteiros '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doquyephf0c ) ( another video : [ here without `` sticks '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkmwr18jvq0 ) ) , [ `` corridinho '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akb6pdnbtf4 ) , [ `` bailinho da madeira '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcffvnptw5i ) , [ `` verde gaio '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7csrznxqs ) , [ `` fandango '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn1mi30tobk ) and [ `` vira '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwgj08nsxii ) - music ... 
  the most well know portuguese type of music is [ `` fado '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jbzihiwle ) ( another video of [ fado ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxv9s3ptizy ) , another type of folk music is the `` desgarrada '' where two singers face each other and start singing against each other usually in form of poem while accompanied by an accordion and/or a harmonica . 
  nowadays the presence of brazilian and angolan music is great in portugal and so it 's common to ear it on the radios and discos/bares typical portuguese instruments are : the [ `` adufe '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgsjt4i_xws ) , [ `` sarronca '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfkca1kyh3s ) , [ `` guitarra portugesa '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkqhaxi0acw ) ( image [ here ] ( http://portoguitarra.com/content/uploads/2014/05/guitarraportuguesa-lisboa.jpg ) ) and the [ `` cavaquinho '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ksccvyveiy ) ( an instrument that would influence the creation of the famous ukulele in hawaii or the kroncong in indonesia ) - architecture ... 
  the art in portugal was influenced by many different and distinct civilizations : the roman empire , germanic tribes ( like the visigoths ) , the muslims from north africa and later also influenced by other european countries like france or england as well as other civilizations around the world during the `` discoveries '' . 
  influenced by the gothic art of the 12-14 century , portugal would create their own style , the [ `` manueline '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manueline ) in the 16th century , here 's an example the [ monastery of jer\u00f3nimos in lisbon ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/jer%c3%b3nimos_april_2009-4.jpg ) , the typical manueline architecture would include elements that resemble the navy and the sea , like the armillary sphere ( also in the portuguese flag ) , ropes , anchors , shells or strings of seaweeds ; symbols of christianity such as the cross of the order of christ ( nowadays used for example as the military aircraft insignia of the portuguese air force ) and also some influence from the architecture of distant places like specially india . 
  this art style was of very short duration , less than 50 years , but made a great impact since it was the style used by the portuguese during the time of the `` discovery '' of brazil , the sea route to india and the colonization of coastal areas around africa and asia . 
  this style would later have a slightly revival as neo-manueline , during the 19th and even 20th century , including in ex-colonies of portugal like brazil . 
  - paint since ancient times that painting was made in portugal , such as the rock-art of [ foz coa ] ( https://arteemtodaaparte.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/foz-coa-parque.jpg ) , probably the most well known portuguese painting are the [ saint vincent panels ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/lagos40_kopie.jpg ) not precisely because of its quality but rather because of the legends and curiosities despite/around that painting , however the most typical painting in a portuguese house is either the `` last supper '' ( a `` copy '' or an adaption ) or a painting of `` the crying boy '' . 
  - literature ... prose , poetry and the dramatic genre are the well-know types of literature used in portugal . 
  with names such as [ e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_maria_de_e%c3%a7a_de_queir%c3%b3s ) that said :  we 're in a state comparable with greece : the same level of poverty , the same political indignity/corruption , the same lowering of ethic , the same public robbery ^ ^ in ^ ^ this ^ ^ case ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ referring ^ ^ the ^ ^ state , the same agiotage , the same decadence of spirit , the same horrendous administration and confusion . 
  in the foreign books , in the magazines , when someone wants to talk about a christian country and that because of its progressive decadence could be someday `` erased '' from the map they mention both portugal and greece ( ... ) ( written by e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3s in 1872 ) and also [ lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu%c3%ads_de_cam%c3%b5es ) , [ fernando pessoa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_pessoa ) , [ almeida garret ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almeida_garrett ) , [ florbela espanca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florbela_espanca ) , [ jos\u00e9 saramago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_saramago ) or [ gil vicente ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gil_vicente ) besides many others . 
  edit : check [ part ii ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/396lyy/portugal_part_ii_cuisine/ ) for the food . 
  [ part i - art ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3955ne/portugal_part_i_art/ ) the portuguese cuisine as multiple influences : mediterranean , atlantic , arabian and even jewish , but also from the former colonies .
