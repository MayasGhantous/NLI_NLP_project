  portuguese is also still known ( at least by older generations ) in `` goa '' and `` daman and diu '' both in india . 
  creoles based on the portuguese language are still known/spoken by some small communities around asia , like : - [ sri lankan portuguese creole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9ouqfksfwa ) , the number of speakers is extremely reduced and this creole is almost extinct . 
  - [ papia kristang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ypkbgjywc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m34s ) spoken in malacca , malaysia . 
  the portuguese is also related with the saramaccan language spoken suriname and french guyana and with papiamento spoken in cura\u00e7ao , aruba and bonaire . 
  and it 's used in ( some ) religious festivities in the island of [ flores ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwe9rjx1fey&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m47s ) , indonesia . 
  and here 's a list of some words from around the world with portuguese origin : - japanese  b\u014dro - bolo  kappa - capa  koppu - copo  manto - manto  marumero - marmelo  oranda - holanda  pan - p\u00e3o - english  banana - banana  breeze - brisa  cachalot - cachalote  caravel - caravela  embarass - embara\u00e7ar  mosquito - mosquito  piranha - piranha  zebra - zebra - afrikaans  kraal - curral  peri-peri - piri-piri  pikinin - pequenino  mielie - milho  `` eh p\u00e1 ! '', 
  [ translation ] ( http://literaryjoint.blogspot.pt/2012/03/fernando-pessoa-mar-portugues.html ) ( remember that this is a poem so it probably does n't make much sense in any other language ), 
  we all know the famous brazilian laugh the `` huehuehue '' , the question is , what 's the main/usual laugh used by you and the fellow citizens of your country in the internet ?

  after reading the [ `` croatian stereotypes about european tourists '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3amdy3/croatian_stereotypes_about_european_tourists/ ) i thought `` well , what are the portuguese ones ? '', 
  and decided to write them down in this post . 
  - english people , they usually arrive in groups , husband , wife , some children and another family , they only speak english even if it 's the 33th time they visit portugal , however sometimes they do try speak the locals language saying things like : `` hola '' , `` gracias '' or `` buenos dias '' . 
  one of the first things they ask is `` is this neighbor safe for my children ? '', 
  which is always a good question , it shows that you 're a good parent , worried about the safety of your child . 
  the next day they 're probably getting a booze , while their children are being taken care by the friendly couple , then in the other day they switch roles . 
  they arrive as white people , they left as `` red '' people and with the feeling that the portuguese favorite dish is beef , 'cause they hear people saying `` bifa '' ( ~ beef ) everytime . 
  but in the end , even if we have some arguing issues , we like them and they like us , and they 'll probably comeback , actually some of them never leave but with this sun and beautiful beaches , who can complain with maddie ... - french people , everybody knows that they only speak french , not even english , luckily the portuguese emigration into france improved the number of portuguese people capable of having at least a basic conversation in french , their conversation usually starts with : `` my portuguese maid ... '' , they usually like the portuguese cuisine , architecture , life-style , etc. . . however in french everything is still better . 
  - french people that are actually not french people , during the summer many portuguese emigrants in france come back , some of them either because they lived some many years aboard or simply because of a inferiority complex almost not speak in portuguese and use only french , is not unusual to hears things like : `` michel tu vas tomber '' or `` jean-pierre viens ici '' , we only know they 're actually portuguese when they get irritated and start swearing : `` jean-pierre viens ici !, 
  - spanish people . 
  basic rule , if a spaniard is in portugal he speaks spanish and you speak portunhol ( spanish + portuguese , something like galician ) , if you 're in spain , they speak portug ... just kidding they speak spanish and you speak `` galician '' . 
  despite the little language argument , they 're actually nice people , we do try to `` educate '' them in order to speak at least a dozen of words in portuguese or at least in `` portunhol '' but they do love their language , we 've to give the merit to french and spanish people in regard of that . 
  contrary to the majority of other tourists they usually came during easter . 
  if they live near the board with portugal the conversation will start with : `` one day i bought a portuguese towel ... '' , in other hand if they live in the other side of spain , like catalunya they will whisper : `` fuck this shit !, 
  why ca n't catalunya be independent too ? 
  we 're better than this ! '', 
  - german people , they made the reservation for the hotel at least a month before . 
  they arrive in the hotel at 8.50 am ( the hotel only opens at 9am ) . 
  at 9.15 am someone opens the gate of the hotel but says : `` i do n't have access to the rooms ... you have to wait for the owner , i 'm sorry '' . 
  finally at 11.30 am the owner arrives just to say : `` sorry , i forgot the key for your room ... 5 minutes and i 'm back , really sorry '' . 
  he 's back at 2pm and says : `` sorry , my wife had the lunch already made ... '' and gives a box to the german tourists at the same time he says : `` take this , my wife made some cod fish pastries ( pasteis de bacalhau ) ... and here 's a good wine '' . 
  in the end , the wine and the food compensate all the time they had to wait . 
  the weather is also quiet good , the architecture is amazing too , the people are very nice . 
  they leave portugal with the feeling that in terms of human relations and weather there 's no better country in ~ ~ africa ~ ~ europe than portugal . 
  - dutch people , they 're somehow similar to german people , however the first thing they will ask is : `` where is the nearest smart shop ? '', 
  for which usually old people answer things like : `` smart ?
