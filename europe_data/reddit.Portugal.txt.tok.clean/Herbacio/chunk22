  man , there 's one of renault in the end of the street ) . 
  during meals they ask things like : `` is this tomato a biological product ? 
  and this potatoes have they got some pesticide ? '', 
  or even `` do you have any veggie dish ? '', 
  ( despite the fact they 're inside a restaurant called `` churrascaria do z\u00e9 '' ( ~ joe 's steak house ) ) - usa people , they 're almost like british people , the better way of distinguish them is looking at their clothes , instead of wearing the `` british flag '' , americans will wear the `` american flag '' . 
  however it 's easier to hear an american try to speak portuguese , like : `` where can i catch the `` onibus '' / `` trem '' ? 
  '' , `` oi , cara '' , etc. . . feel free to add more and to rectify some of those . 
  remember this is n't made with the intention of criticize other cultures , every culture as their personal traces and those are the traces that made those cultures unique . 
  and remember we 're all individuals , even if the majority of your country is rude or dumb it does n't mean you 're too , and the contrary also applies , even if your country has the stereotype of being very smart if you do n't act like a smart people then the stereotype wo n't save you . 
  i do believe that in a overall view the eu is a good thing for all its members and even partners , but unfortunately it was n't always done in the more rightfully way , not all the measures are the better ones , and worst of all there is still no real union between its members ( in other hand we have this sub to help us approach each others ) . 
  being portuguese it 's easier for me to talk about the portuguese case , since 1415 that portugal started its age of discoveries , in 1961 portugal had territories in africa ( angola , mozambique , ... ) , india , east timor and macau . 
  till 1974 we lived in a dictatorship , our relation with europe was 0 , we never turned our heads to europe , we had almost no relations at all with europe ( except england ) , the trade was made between portugal and its colonies . 
  yes , it 's true that we turned ourselves into europe sometimes through the ages , like to fight the spaniards , the french or the germans . 
  then in 1974 the dictatorship ended , we `` lose '' the colonies , and 12 years later we 're in european union . 
  1415 ... 1974 , more than 500 years . 
  1974 ... 1986 , 12 years . 
  you see , we had our back turned into europe for a very long time , we ca n't make a 180o turn in a decade . 
  many people lived from the fishing , agriculture , textiles and things like that , we entered in eu and all of that as reduced to instead improve the services , the infrastructures , roads , etc. . . the problem is that you ca n't build a house starting with the roof . 
  now we have roads that lead to nowhere , closed medical centers and schools , etc. . . and `` desert '' land that could be used for agricultural purposes but that ca n't be used because it would overpass the `` limits '' made by eu . 
  i 'm sure similar things happened all over europe , but like i said the overall idea of the european union is great , however besides all the things that unite us , we have to remember that portugal is not greece but also not france , germany or latvia , lithuania is n't spain or malta , etc. . . for the good or for the bad we have to analyze each country first as an individual and only then in the group ( eu ) otherwise we may be doing good for the union but hurting the country which in a long term may end up also hurting the whole union . 
  that 's just my opinion . 
  and to finalize , i would n't say that i hate but it kinda hurts hearings things about greece , spain and of course us ( portugal ) saying that we 're lazy and things like that , i work during vacations not only to make money to go a week ( or even less ) to a cheap hotel near the beach but also to help pay my university dispenses . 
  we may look lazy , and many times we act like as absolutely lazy people but we 've a saying here `` trabalho \u00e9 trabalho , conhaque \u00e9 conhaque '' ( trans : `` work is work , cognac is cognac ) which means that if you 're working then you give all your best to it , you work hard , for real , but when the work ends then you can also party hard . 
  remember that when you 're in vacations in a portuguese or spanish beach , probably there are a lot of people from those countries that are also in vacation , it 's not like we go out all days . 
  greetings to everybody . 
  my suggestion would be to create week threads where we would discuss about an european country . 
  a mix of an ama , travel advice , political discussion , etc. . . 
  the `` natives '' of that country would answer questions , give informations , as well as foreigners who have visited or lived in the country . 
  this would be a way to promote all the european countries and their cultures but also to approach us all . 
  what do you think ?

  imagine that most foreigners say that fish in your country is really good , but in other hand you and the must the people from your country think that the fish is not that great . 
  or the other way around foreigners may think that the fish in your country is horrible but despite that the local people praise the fish like is some kind of divine dish . 
  who is that guy or woman , that is/was a completely badass , that one that alone defeated an `` army '' , that woman that lead to something great for your country , etc. . . [ example for portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fern%c3%a3o_lopes_%28soldier%29 ) . 
  now that we all have point fingers to isis , to usa , to french government , etc. . . let 's all take a look at ourselves . 
  it may have been a long long long time ago or maybe it was just `` yesterday '' but what `` bad thing '' did your country ?

  now that czech republic as decided to change his name , if you had to make the same with your country what name would you choose and why ? 
  [ removed ], 
  in your opinion who are the greatest people , dead or alive , of your country ? 
  here is my top 10 for portugal : - ** d.afonso henriques ** ( afonso i ) , founder of portugal , known as `` the conqueror '' for his fights during reconquista . 
  - ** saint anthony of lisbon ** aka st.anthony of padua , is the saint patron of portugal , brazil , american indians , fishermen , poor people , oppressed people , pregnant women , etc. . . more than a saint he 's also a doctor of the church - ** henry , the navigator ** , son of john i , he was the main initiator of the portuguese discoveries , financing explorers , merchants and naval engineers . 
  - ** vasco da gama ** , explorer that discovered the sea route to india , which would lead to the golden age of portugal , with the flow of spices giving an huge boost to the portuguese economy ; from a port city in goa , to a football club in brazil and many streets in portugal , and even a moon crater , da gama is one the widely known portuguese . 
  - ** afonso de albuquerque ** , explorer and portuguese general , he became known as `` the lion of the seas '' , `` the caesar of the east '' , etc. . . he was the first european to reach the maluku islands ( spice islands ) and was the commander of several battles in the beginning of the 16th century , including ormuz ( 1507 ) , goa ( 1510 ) and malacca ( 1511 ) - ** lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es ** , portuguese poet , his most well known works is the epic `` os lus\u00edadas '' ( the lusiads ) . 
  portuguese language is often called as `` language of cam\u00f5es '' . 
  - ** pedro iv ** , known in brazil as pedro i. 
  despite is liberation of brazil , pedro is still regarded as a great portuguese due to his great assistance during the portuguese civil war . 
  - ** gago coutinho and sacadura cabral ** ( 2 different people ) , those 2 men ca n't be disassociated , modern age explorers , together they made the first aerial crossing of the south atlantic in 1922 , which was also the first aerial crossing of the atlantic without naval assistance , connecting lisbon ( portugal ) with rio de janeiro ( brazil ) during the celebration of 100th anniversary of the brazilian independence . 
  - ** fernando pessoa ** , portuguese poet of the 20th century , his well known works are `` message '' and `` the book of disquiet '' - ** am\u00e1lia rodrigues ** , portuguese singer known as `` the queen of fado , she is regarded as the main figure of fado , the most prominently type of portuguese music ; during the mid 20th century she was alongside the footballer eus\u00e9bio one of the most well known figures of portugal,

  in luxembourg too , right ? 
  i heard that back in the 70s roller hockey was really popular here in portugal , the national team was winning all the major trophies , as also did clubs like porto , sporting and benfica , while on the opposite side the portuguese football team went through all the 70s without even participating in any major tournament ( euro or world cup ), 
  and if you live in a village is also common to hear people asking for a `` caf\u00e9 com cheirinho '' ( a coffee with a little smell ) , which is a espresso with a bit of [ aguardente ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aguardiente#portugal ), 
   and almost all french on my father 's one , with some italian ancestors . 
  hello monsieur napoleon !, 
  i do n't live in lisbon , but the few times i have been there ( like 3 days per year ) , i think i have seen maximum a dozen of people with hijab, 
  old people sometimes put * vegetables * in bootles of vinegar to conserve them ( the pickles i mean ) , which end up being kind like pickles ... but maybe it 's more usual in rural areas . 
  now imagine being in a island like us . 
  my grandfather already surpassed the 90s and for most of his life he drank at least one [ aguardente ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aguardiente#portugal ) every day . 
  plus , lots and lots of wine . 
  so i guess for some people it does n't affect as much as others ... 
  [ boa sorte / good luck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4k6jgc7uva ), 
  faster thant the spaniards ? 
  brazilians and spaniards often say we speak with an `` hot potato in our mouths '' , we do n't speak fast we just `` eat '' some letters , which is way we sound slavic while speaking .

  but is n't `` montenegro '' in reference to a `` black mountain '' instead of the country itself ? 
  that 's it . 
  for americans , whenever they 're about the brits it 's either politics or something related with royalty , while us european have direct/close contact with hooligans and others alike that came from uk, 
  that from spain neither good marriages nor good winds , or at least that 's how the saying goes, 
  and in tier 2 : futre , deco and rui costa, 
  the antipode of taiwan is the region of formosa in argentina . 
  indeed , it 's a nickname given to various cities . 
  - lisbon - city of the seven hills - porto - unbeaten city - aveiro - portuguese venice - \u00c1gueda - hardware land - braga - youth 's city | capital of minho ( portuguese region ) - guimar\u00e3es - crib city - covilh\u00e3 - portuguese manchester - coimbra - students city - \u00c9vora - capital of alentejo ( portuguese region ) - guarda - city of the 5 f 's - \u00d3bidos - christmas village ( mainly during the holiday ) - oeiras - europe 's silicon valley - cascais - portuguese riviera - elvas - queen of the border - pa\u00e7os de ferreira - capital of furniture - entroncamento - land of phenomena - goleg\u00e3 - horse 's land - tomar - templars city - chaves - city of the thermal baths - vila real - court of tr\u00e1s-os-montes ( portuguese region ) ... 
  yes , we 're already doing it . 
  we have the ocean to explore , and you have the money to finance such journeys, 
   pretogues think i never heard it , but i giggled . 
  in the 50s brazil was one of the main destinations of portuguese migrants , mainly from madeira and north portugal , most of them were poor people looking for the ^ ^ south american dream . 
  nowadays there is also a good amount of people going to brazil but they 're in general engineers and things like that , people with university degrees . 
  in portugal is both economical and ... just a way of doing things . 
  you hit the majority age and you either go to university or start working ... you ca n't find work in portugal ? 
  ok , there 's already a brother , a uncle , a neighbour working somewhere , you 'll go there and try your luck too . 
  0.4 % of americans are portuguese or have portuguese ancestry , 1.3 % of canadians in the same situation , around 1 % of argentinians and angolans , 1.5 % in france , 3 % in swiss , 5 % in venezuela and of course around 16 % of luxembourgers .
