  well fifa as 209 national associations , but does it really mean that we all support and help each others ? 
  like i said , of course we could make some agreements , like trade agreements just like we already do in european union , but in many things we 're going to be still different , like in politics , culture , language , etc. . . 
  so yes , i agree that we can make `` unions '' but not an union , unless is something like usa where each state as is own laws , etc. . . but that 's basically what we have already now . 
  i do n't get why people downvoted you ... trying to unite such diversity of countries would cause more damage than good . 
  the way of thinking and act from someone in portugal or spain is different from someone in norway or sweden , neither is wrong or right , they 're just different . 
  of course we can all still have agreement in specific points/affairs , but not a unity as whole in all the matters . 
  yeah , sure know i 'm a rightwinger because i ( jokingly ) demonstrate how dumb was your argument . 
  you bring the past to justify the present , but then it 's me `` that want to perpetuate the vices of the past '' , logic over 9000 !, 
  populating australia !, 
  the world evolves , you know that right ? 
  why is there always someone bringing up the past to justify the present ? 
  you obviously know that those were bad things , so they should n't be copied . 
  instead of saying : `` but he did it too ! '', 
  you should be thinking : `` he did this , it was wrong , so they should n't be doing it again '' but , yeah , vengeance !, 
  dead to king edward i !, 
  fredoooooooooooooom !, 
  but , yeah ... you kind understand that people look at you like a `` big andorra '' but instead of being spain and france it 's france and netherlands . 
  i imagine your way of speaking in a quiet funny way , half latin , half germanic . 
  fancy things you say in latin , common/elementary things in germanic, 
  problems in metro or airport ? 
  but i kind understand why you think it 's chaotic , you just stayed 1 day , in countries like portugal , spain or italy you need to know how to relax and with just one day it 's hard to do it , so you end up to being at a much higher rhythm than the portuguese people around you . 
  and my small village of around 250 people is even better . 
  we made a fest where more than 2000 people appeared . 
  it 's like 10 times more than our total population . 
  do you see 5m people in rock in rio lisboa or some other festival ? 
  i do n't think so ... we 're clearly better . 
  we either thimk you 're french or dutch, 
  no , it means that you do n't visit my lovely country !, 
  i only knew about 2 belgians in portugal . 
  witsel and defour . 
  true , which is kinda dumb , but you know ... i had to make the joke . 
  well if it 's 5 hours , then it 's 5 days of pastries and wine or some portuguese product xd it 's like going to a bar , the portuguese guy is going to arrive 1 hour later , but it 's almost guaranteed that he 's going to buy drinks to everyone , despite the fact that he 's the poorer one and that while he buys one drink you could buy 5 in portugal with your average salary , that 's why in the end people `` forget '' the delay , we really try to compensate them , even if it 's of a sacrifice to us . 
  but ... but ... our wine and codfish pastries are really really good :'(, 
  btw , [ thanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) , you 're actually [ helpful to us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_restoration_war ),

  dammit , i knew i had made a mistake ... 
  maybe all the dutch tourists in portugal are from amsterdam xd, 
  well , more than 99 % of russia is geographically nordic when compared with spain xd, 
  it really depends on the way of the speak/say it . 
  if i know you 're an english speaker , i would probably answer to you in english as well , even if you spoke to me in portuguese , and why ? 
  simple , because you made the effort of speaking `` my '' language , so i should also made the effort to speak `` your '' language , it 's actually polite to do so , it shows both people are trying to speak the others language , it shows that both learnt each others language and are using it . 
  however like i said in the start , it really depends on the way the people said it to you , if they say it in a rude away , then of course they 're simply rude people but they would be rude anyway either if they speak english , portuguese or even klingon . 
  is quite rude . 
  i do n't get this part ... why is it rude ? 
  portuguese tiles are part of the portuguese culture and architecture , so they end up being a good souvenir for tourists . 
  many private houses and also monuments have `` portuguese tiles '' , either as a pattern for example like [ this ] ( http://www.aleluia.pt/arq/img/v-lamego-ap-122-comp-4.jpg ) ( usually is only a part of the house , but there also cases like this [ one ] ( http://www.algarve-vacation.com/assets/images/casaazulejos00.jpg ) or in some cases the tiles form images ( usually religious , naval and historical images ) like [ this , about the battle of aljubarrota ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/azulejos_parque_eduardo_vii-2.jpg ) , and also [ this one in tomar , portugal ] ( http://city-of-tomar.com/tomar-artistic-tiles/tile-mural-rua-cascalheira-tomar-portugal.jpg ) or [ this about the conquest of ceuta ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n1yz5st.jpg ) or even this one [ with boats in tagus river ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2ipaea8.jpg ) what happens is that some people take some of the tiles ( the squares ) and go sell them in `` street fairs '' and we end up with things like [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bckng_zce_k/sxegvuunfii/aaaaaaaaxuq/a3qbryqaxbu/s400/017.jpg ) . 
  there 's no problem in buying portuguese tiles , but first try to know if the seller is vending is own tiles or at least previous bought ones and not some tiles stolen from someone else or even worst from a monument . 
  yes , i 've nice logical fallacies , but at least is not my country how is being attacked , right ? 
  and that 's maybe because we and luckly also our neighbor follow those fallacies . 
  but yeah keep up the guns , war is gon na be the salvation . 
  damn , should n't have open , i had hopes that would be a sub about the `` corpse bride '' of tim burton . 
  in fact everybody is a bot , except me , of course . 
  and you think what they 've done was right ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  for example , there are people in ukraine that have been affected by the war , and i 'm sure that plenty of people helped them , so why not showing images of people helping each other ? 
  images of ukrainians helping each other , i believe that would help raise the awaraness through ukraine a bit higher than showing bombs . 
  is just that , nothing more . 
  you probably know much about war , do n't you ? 
  i do n't give a crap about russian army , ukrainian army or the ministers from both countries . 
  but as an human being i do care about the people , about the civilians , if you think bombing ( from both sides ! ), 
  is the right thing to do , then sure ... maybe you should offer yourself either as human-shield to protect some di * khead from the govern ( you can choose the side ) or as `` meat for the cannon '' . 
  let 's bomb everything for world peace !, 
  stop being an ignorant . 
  i know that cities have been attacked , but at some point someone have to stop , and start thinking with the brain instead of keeping measuring dic * s do you really think the solution for the conflict is war ? 
  one day russia attacks , in the other ukraine attacks , and he will keep with that forever until it 's to late for everybody . 
  but , know for real , is there any wall in the border between russia and ukraine ? 
  and i mean a real wall ( solid one ) , if not they should probably do it . 
  i know it 's a pretty big border , but at least they would prevent land invasions from russia and also guerrilla/militia incursions . 
  a wall is never a good thing , but if your neighbor does n't know how to behave maybe it 's the better solution , at least in the beginning . 
  eu and nato wo n't help ukraine , at least not now , and have in account that russia is ... well , a very big country ( and with a great army ) ukraine should organize their defenses as well , i mean , ukraine may bombard russia but they will still have a great army ( at least in number ) and they will probably retaliate . 
  yes , i know , just kind of simplifying it . 
  but thanks to put the post in here , 
  kim kardashian is also famous , it does n't make her a good role model . 
  just because fucked up pro-russians post videos abusing and torturing ukrainians you do n't have to do the same thing . 
  post videos of ukrainians helping each other , post videos of ukrainians civilians helping russian civilians and vice-versa . 
   what rule are they actually breaking by posting this ? 
  like i said , it 's not the rules of reddit , but of life . 
   who do you see here that is `` praying for the war '' ? 
  are you serious ? 
  i guess when someone comes in your own home and hits you and throws bombs at you , you just say : `` neah dude , i 'm against war , i wo n't fight back ! '' . 
  you know that you ca n't fight back without using fuckin ' bombs , right ? 
  someone is invading my house ... what should i do ? 
  a ) try to catch the guy and arrest him ( if possible accuse him of war crimes in haia ) b ) if `` a '' is not possible , then you shot him . 
  c ) let 's sent fuckin ' bombs into this motherf * ck3r country !, 
  ( it does n't matter if some civilian dies , the important thing is that the di * khead got blow up too ) i would n't even mind if ukraine attacked russian with soldiers , but using bombs , rockets and things like that , ... everybody knows that many armies use civilians as human shields , so everytime they sent a rocket or something similar to kill a general , a sargent , etc. . . remember that maybe some innocent people are dying . 
  and tell me , after they sent the bombs , would it solve anything ? 
  the must logical thing to happen is a retaliation from russia . 
  but hey , good luck for ukrainians and good luck for russians . 
  yes , good luck for both , good luck for the people , for the civilians . 
  the rest are just acting under interests , must do n't care about the `` regular joe '' either if is ukrainian , russian or whatever . 
  the death of franz ferdinand was pretty much just an excuse , the war would probably happen anyway , they just need a motive it ended up being that , but could be anything . 
  and we can never be sure about what the change of a `` factor '' ( in this case putin ) could influence the course of history or at least of this conflict . 
  but one thing is sure with our without putin and with or without many world leaders we 're already at war . 
  if the problem is putin , i 'm sure there are plenty of snipers capable of shooting him . 
  is that really necessary to send bombs that can possible kill inocent people ? 
  i never understood why we 've to sent bombs and armies , when clearly must of the wars are `` fabricated '' by a small bunch of people . 
  i know the war already happened , but we 're still praying for it instead of trying to solve it . 
  and do n't even give a damn about who is right or wrong . 
  say a war that had been good for the people in general and all i start rooting right away for this war .
