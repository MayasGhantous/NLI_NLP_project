  this is fucked up . 
  reddit banned the `` fat people hate '' because it was an incentive to joke around fat people . 
  but this ... this breaks all the rules . 
  the rules of humanity , not reddit . 
  we 're people not animals . 
  praying for the war wo n't solve anything . 
  i know that there are wars , the real world sometimes is a bad place , but we should be working for it to be a better place , not rooting for wars to happen . 
  / u/dkrandu said :  what you 'll probably not find in greece is people with monthly pensions lower than 1-2 euro , which you can find plenty of in romania . 
  yes , 1-2 euro , not a typo . 
  and i said it 's crazy how people can survive in europe with that money, 
  so that people with 1 $ month can buy 2kg of potatoes per month ? 
  it 's crazy how that people can survive ... even if you live from agriculture and you plant your vegetables and fruits there are always bad years ( i mean , years or months , when massive dry or constant rain simply destroy your plantations ) either the weather in romania is always perfect and you can plant without worries , or that people is obligated to steal in order to survive . 
  it 's crazy . 
  vietnamese employees are like : `` 100 $ ? 
  why do you need so much money ? 
  a bowl of rice is enough , be competitive ! '', 
  how much does it cost a potato-seed in romania or a bag/sack of them ? 
  of course , india will be the next participant of eurovision !, 
  the first invasion of the iberian peninsula was lead by [ tariq ibn ziyad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tariq_ibn_ziyad ) and he was berber , born somewhere in maghreb . 
  and in fact it was the iberians themselves who called the moors . 
  must of iberia was rulled by the visigoth king wittiza , but after is died 2 people reclaimed the throne roderic and achila ii . 
  so then a civil war started in the peninsula and the supporters of achila ii called for help in north africa , more specifically with the governor of ifriqiya ( a territory in parts of what 's today algeria , tunisia and libya ) , musa bin nusayr however it 's true that all that territory in north africa was part of umayyad caliphate ( however the capital of this territory was damascus , in syria . 
  later it changed to harran in turkey and finally in c\u00f3rdoba , spain . 
  but it never was in the arabian peninsula ) in fact the invasion was purely made by the berbers at least in the beginning , the invasion was made in 711 without the consent of the caliph al-walid i and so musa bin nusayr was called in order to justify is actions , i would then by made prisoner and finally executed in 716 . 
  after that the invasion keep being made mostly by berbers with some sporadic help from other `` tribes '' of the caliphate . 
  so despite the moors being part of the umayyad caliphate , they 're mainly berbers and it was that influence that they introduced in iberian peninsula . 
  clima ? 
  thanks for warning me . 
  i will correct it . 
  `` szeto '' really looks like an italian word :d, 
  i think so , it 's problem an invented language like `` pig latin '' , `` jeringonza '' , `` spielsprache '' or `` l\u00edngua dos p\u00eas '' opo meupeu papa\u00edspi \u00e9pe porpotupugalpa ( or something like this ... ), 
  it was just a coincidence , some of those most voted posts have been made by foreigners ( for example a canadian in latvia or an australian in spain ) and others are english simply because the sub is more a `` travel/helping foreigners '' thing rather than the `` native language '' sub . 
  for example in my case , / r/portugal top 10 posts are : 1 ) `` the feels '' it 's an internet ( english ) expression so it does n't have a clearly translation . 
  os meus parab\u00e9ns '' ... translation : `` the cover of i ( newspaper ) from today . 
  my congratulations '' 3 ) `` pedido urgente de ajuda : lisboa '' ... translation : `` urgent request for help : lisbon '' 4 ) `` the most accurate map of portugal ever made '' 5 ) `` bom trabalho r/portugal ! '', 
  ... translation : `` good work r/portugal ! '', 
  6 ) `` a vipur , empresa que vende filtros de \u00e1gua para uso dom\u00e9stico , \u00e9 uma fraude '' ... translation : `` the vipur , company that sells water filters for home use , is a fraud '' 7 ) `` evidente que essa \u00e9 a verdadeira bandeira ( sobevotos para eles ficaram com isso no topo ) '' ... translation : `` clearly this is the true flag ( upvotes so they got it on top ) 8 ) `` friendly reminder to our kind visitors '' ( like it says it 's a reminder for the visitors , so it was posted in english ) 9 ) `` vou \u00e0s putas e depois coloco relatos em f\u00f3runs , amaa '' ... translation : `` i go to the bit *** / wh ** es and then i put ( my ) reports/stories in forums '' 10 ) `` o bill murray e o jerry seinfeld viciaram-me no reddit . '', 
  ... translation : `` bill murray and jerry seinfeld addicted me on reddit '' so you have 3 in english and 7 in portuguese . 
  well , / r/germany as 24556 readers , in other hand / r/de 19944 readers . 
  are there any other `` german speaking sub '' with more readers than / r/de ? 
  i used the subreddits linked/provided by / r/europe some countries have an `` official language '' version and an english version , others have a mix of the two , so i decided to simply use the ones provided by / r/europe in order to keep some order and patern . 
  edit : but thanks for the / r/norge post , 
  you should be asking about australia . 
  argentina is white , not european . 
  neither is the one from bosnia and herzegovina , serbia , moldova and romania . 
  the sub is ruled by monkeys . 
  he 's just a `` pirate '' trying to take the control of the sub . 
  yes , but not a bunch . 
  we only had 6 naturalized players in our team . 
  l\u00facio soares , brazilian-born ( defender ) made 5 games for portugal in 60s . 
  david j\u00falio , from south-africa ( midfielder ) made 4 games for portugal also in the 60s . 
  celso matos , from brazil ( midfielder ) made 3 games for portugal in the 70s deco , from brazil ( midfielder ) made 75 games for portugal between 2003 and 2010 . 
  pepe , from brazil ( defender ) made 65 games since 2007 liedson , from brazil ( cf ) made 15 games for portugal between 2009 and 2010 . 
  is not that much ... i 'm not even sure if there any game where deco , pepe and liedson played together , but that would be the maximum 3 `` brazilian-born '' players . 
  portugal 1 - 0 it\u00c1lia !, 
  viva o viriato !, 
  ^ ^ sorry ... ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ guess, 
  in many cases the `` circlejerk '' subreddits have more connection than the country subreddit . 
  for example / r/spain as no connections with any european country . 
  whoever / r/epana as connections with / r/inglin , / r/itaglia , / r/rance , / r/schland and / r/portugalcaralho / r/rance is connected with / r/buenzli ( switzerland ) , epana , schland , itaglia , / r/danmag ( denmark ) etc. . . most of those circlejerk subreddits are connected with each other . 
  we really love to hate each other , that 's pretty much the link between all of us . 
  singing in eurovision should n't be about popularity , but representing you country . 
  next time for the euro 2016 we could naturalize a bunch of brazilians and play with them , since the objective is winning and we may have a better chance than say ... playing with eliseu . 
  `` we '' sent a portuguese song in all the eurovision editions we participated ( 48 times ) . 
  portugal ends always in `` bad '' positions , but i would rather know that they keep singing in portuguese and finish last than singing in english just to try for the first place . 
  i think you should have a second look on the [ 2010 world cup music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prpeedmmmq0 ) . 
  what 's the pronunciation ? 
  ( how do you read an `` w '' in japanese ? ), 
  i guess that '' \u043b\u043e\u043b '' is `` lol '' , right ? 
  but why the brackets ? 
  this time for africa !, 
  ^ ^ agora ^ ^ com ^ ^ essa ^ ^ do ^ ^ `` hahaha '' ^ ^ \u00e9 ^ ^ que ^ ^ me ^ ^ lixaste , ^ ^ pensei ^ ^ que ^ ^ era ^ ^ `` ahahah '' ^ ^ ... now with the `` hahaha '' you screwed me , i thought it was `` ahahah '' ... 
   and believe me i have never in my life heard any sentiment or stereotype against portuguese people you probably never heard anything about portuguese people :p but yes , but i understand , i was n't trying to say that this something germans say , it 's just a generalized stereotype . 
   they have every right to elect what they want , but i do n't have to agree with it , sry . 
  and yes , i absolutely agree with this . 
  i hope that my country does n't `` go '' to an extreme ( i mean , elect an far-right or far-left party ) and if we do so , then i do n't want to see my country doing `` mind games '' like greece is doing right now , it does n't help neither them or the european union they 're just delaying the inevitable . 
  portugal is in crisis and we had to send money too ( of course a smaller amount , but we did it ) , is it our fault the situation in greece ? 
  of course not . 
  but we 're in the european union ... union . 
  if you 're not willing to help one member then how can we call this a union ? 
  and trust me , the german govern is a smart one ( and i 'm saying this in a good way ) , countries like portugal and greece are in crisis however in many areas the importation of german products to those countries have increased since the beginning of all those process of `` solving '' their crisis , it 's not simple coincidence , nobody would be giving money to greece or portugal without having a minimum of guarantees . 
  of course it 's always a risk to german ( and in a smaller percentage to all the other countries of eu ) and we 've to thank that there 's at least a country in `` good shape '' capable of helping us . 
  about being called nazis , well , you 've been called that even before this crisis started , of course the number of times you hear it increased but carry on , do n't listen to that people . 
  the fun thing is that most of the times the ones saying that germans are nazis , are people from far right-wing parties ( fascists ) ... 
  it 's kind like when people say portuguese people are lazy ( of course there is no comparison between lazy and nazi !, 
  ) , we 're one the countries with more work hours , with less vacation days , etc. . . but then `` they '' ( other europeans ) see us party , they see us on the beach ( during the summer ) and they think that 's our life , that we 're always partying and always on the beach , but they forget that 1 ) nobody works 24 hours , you can still have a little time to party at night or during the weekends 2 ) when they 're on the beach they 're in summer vacation , just like we 're . 
  there 's a saying there : `` trabalho \u00e9 trabalho , conhaque \u00e9 conhaque '' ( which is `` work is work , cognac is cognac '' that can be interpreted as `` work is one thing , parties are another , we 've time to both '' ), 
  [ catalunya vs castilla ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/580/477/a53.gif ) [ galicia reaction ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/ftxvssyrzkxxg/giphy.gif ) [ portugal reaction ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6pp1f6mvwuu/tthqx2pccoi/aaaaaaaagts/kj7i9xrd4vo/s1600/porrada%2bfrente.jpg ), 
  1 ) why would a greek care about the opinion of the german people ? 
  one thing would be a survey with all the eu countries , other is survey only germany . 
  of course you may have your opinion , but the opinion of the german people wo n't change the opinion of the majority of the eu , right ? 
  2 ) i 'm not sure about how many information does the german public knows about the greek situation , but i 'm willing to say that they do n't know the whole story , just like i do n't know and neither ( almost ) anybody . 
  but they also choose the side that won . 
  you ca n't win but either ca n't lose . 
  true , but when you 're a jew in a middle of a war between christians and muslims in order to survive you either run away or try to keep the balance neutral helping both sides , i really ca n't condemn them for that ... 
  people need to understand the difference between what happen with the sephardic jews and muslims . 
  the jews are people that freely came to iberia , they helped developing both kingdoms of portugal and castile , they helped with finance , they helped through the beginning of the age of the discoveries . 
  in other hand , the northern african muslims came as conquerors , as invaders . 
  both kingdoms fight against them all the time . 
  of course some christians converted to islamic , and some made the opposite ( islamic to christianity ) but we ca n't really count them , must converted simply because they 're pressure to do so .
