  but who do you do know if someone is a forced `` converso '' or simply descendant of muslims ? 
  is it because it had an christian iberian ancestor ? 
  well , ok , that would be a good option , but what if both `` gran-gran-gran-gran - ... - parents '' are christians ? 
  yes , that would be great to prove that someone was converted to muslim ... but does it prove that he was forced to do so ? 
  people need to understand that this has nothing to do with being muslims , jews or buddhists or whatever , are just historical facts . 
  hey , let 's call some germans i heard some germanic tribes got expelled from the iberia too , and the romans !, 
  why not the carthaginese from libya , malta , algeria , ... ? 
  or even the french ... poor french that got expelled from iberia . 
  see that 's ridiculous . 
  besides , nowadays everybody is talking about their borders , about mediterranean refugees and illegal immigrants and every that passes is harder to `` enter '' in europe even as a legal immigrant , so portugal and spain made a little step and let `` some '' jews enter in their territory ( which let 's be frank , it 's good to everybody ) but in other hand at this time , if they started passing citizenship to north africans muslims what could happen ? 
  first of all , we would be the open door to europe , well , no problem with that , the problem is that we live in highly bureaucratic countries , and having all them trying to apply to the portuguese and spanish nationality i think that he could cause a collapse ( and i really meant that ) , at least in portugal if you want some paper from the state you have to wait hours , days , months !, 
  do you imagine what could happen ? 
  both portugal and spain are going through a crisis , the people are already irritate with their governs , then they go to pay for example the water account and instead of waiting 1h , they have to wait 10h because there 's a queue of more than 100 muslims trying to apply for the nationality . 
  it would probably be no problem if everybody was living happy , but they are n't . 
  i wo n't say that people would start bonfires again to burn muslims but of course they would be kind of irritate with all the situation and of course mostly with their governs . 
  seems that someone smoked expired date pot, 
  yes , i know they 're all royal seals , i just said that i do n't know what exactly did they represent besides being the royal seal of d.afonso henriques . 
  and yes we still have plenty of `` commemorative coins '' the thing is that you have , for example , 1 of those coins for each 1000 `` regular coins '' that you have in circulation . 
  in other hand with the escudo things are like this : a : `` oh look we 're in 2015 , let 's make a coin celebrating the 600th anniversary of the conquest of ceuta ! '', 
  b : `` and in 1515 we arrived in timor , let 's make a coin about that too ! '', 
  a : `` yes , indeed . 
  but how many of those coins should we make ? '', 
  maybe more ... '' a : `` screw that ... we make them all ! '', 
  b : `` so ... 100esc celebrating the conquest of ceuta and 200esc celebrating the arriving in timor , is that fine ? '', 
  `` colonial style '' , `` glorious days '' , `` conquest and purity '' . 
  either portuguese or spanish . 
  i do n't really miss the old currency of my country ( escudo ) but i miss the figures they put on them . 
  nowadays the portuguese version of euro coins are [ plain simple ] ( http://taco.thoma.be/euro/portugal.jpg ) , 1 , 2 and 5 cents display a cross ; and the others ... well i do n't even know what they really represent , i do know however that they 're the royal stamp used by our first king d.afonso henriques . 
  but with escudo we had a whole role of different images , like [ boats ] ( http://www.moedantiga.com/prodimages/601_big.jpg ) and [ more boats ] ( http://www.coinfactswiki.com/w/images/thumb/4/47/portugal_1932_5_escudos_ubs_84-1390q00.jpg/500px-portugal_1932_5_escudos_ubs_84-1390q00.jpg ) , of course we also had coins with the figure of [ henry , the navigator ] ( http://i.ucoin.net/coin/2523/25232/2523215_2/portugal-5-escudos-1960.jpg ) ( here is [ another ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/437f_km670_portugal_-_200_escudos_1994_henrique_navegador__cupro-niquel_.jpg ) one ) , or celebrating battles , like the [ battle of ourique ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/309h_km579_portugal_-_10_escudos_1928_batalha_ourique__prata_.jpg ) , or even celebrating constructions like the 25th april bridge known at the time as [ `` salazar bridge '' ] ( http://static-numista.com/catalogue/photos/portugal/g1277.jpg ) , even a coin celebrating the 9 years that [ columbus ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/427o_km658_portugal_-_200_escudos_1991_colombo_e_portugal__cupro_niquel_.jpg ) lived in portugal . 
  the arriving of the portuguese traders in [ china ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/446h_km690_portugal_-_200_escudos_1996_china__cupro-niquel_.jpg ) , the introduction of [ fire guns in japan ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/434f_km666_portugal_-_200_escudos_1993_espingarda__cupro-niquel_.jpg ) , the [ `` discovery '' of australia in 1522 ] ( http://www.numisgaia.com/cubecart/images/source/444c_km684_portugal_-_200_escudos_1995_australia__cupro-niquel_.jpg ) , the [ treaty of tordesillas ] ( http://www.leilaojusto.com/media/lots/774/img_0419.jpg ) with spain ( castille ) , we even had commemorative coins of animals like the [ lusitano horse ] ( http://mlb-s1-p.mlstatic.com/958-1000-escudos-moeda-de-prata-portugal-estojo-r-15000-20453-mlb20191439877_112014-o.jpg ) or the [ iberian wolf ] ( http://l.rapimg.com/upload_tmp/0/img_220433275_1294608338_abig.jpg ) , or traditional [ folk dance ] ( http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/5233/gg2q.jpg ) , etc. . . of course most of those coins are commemorative coins , but the thing was ... we had something to commemorate every year , every month , nowadays we 've like a celebratory coin in like 3 in 3 years and they are n't even about `` our '' country , either it 's celebrating the 200 years of the death of a french scientist , the born of a german mathematician or even some battle between hungry and poland ( of course those are just examples ) and this had nothing to do with the `` fascist '' ( right-wing ) regime of portugal , because it ended in 1974 and we still had those commemorative coins till the end of escudo . 
  then we entered on euro , and it seems like we simply forgot all those things that we once celebrated , i do know that we ca n't live in the past , what matters is the present , but the truth is , if we want a better future we ca n't erase the past , sometimes we have to look back and see what we 've done good to try it again and what we 've done wrong in order to not repeat again . 
  right ? 
  oil is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ very ^ ^ slowly losing economical `` power '' in other hand codfish is eternal and we ( portuguese ) are gon na eat it probably forever, 
  you can walk , you can drive a bicycle or even use an electric car but you ca n't eat oil with potatoes . 
  so yes , codfish it is . 
  the portuguese flag :') [ portuguese vandalism ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qccncdato5q/s3ngqt34tzi/aaaaaaaabew/0tpio87_l8g/s1600/p8281333.jpg ) is the best [ vandalism ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/34171/20050727pt_paradamonte.jpg ) , do n't you [ think ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/setembro2006_021.jpg ) :d, 
  codfish from norway ? 
  you do n't have to say sorry for saying that `` brazilian portuguese is spoken by 20 times more people than european portuguese '' , ... that 's just a fact . 
  thanks and have a nice day , 
  you probably have to wait till 12 october , that 's the day of spanish national day because that 's the spanish dish . 
  but yes , we eat it too , but we call it `` arroz \u00e0 valenciana '' ( valencian rice ) instead of paella . 
  the fridge is a `` recent '' thing , so people to conserve their food used salt . 
  portugal was ( and still is ) a great producer of salt and there are sources from at least since the 10th century talking about fishermen and merchants trading for salt in portugal and greatest importers of salt ( at least at the time ) are the scandinavians . 
  those scandinavians boats would carry cod fish ( and other stuff , of course ) which would be traded for the salt . 
  this was pretty much the beginning of the `` passion '' , later in the 13th century two portuguese princesses would marry two danish kings , berengaria of portugal with valdemar ii of denmark and eleanor of portugal with valdemar the young the relations between portugal and denmark like you can see are pretty close at the time , which would help to develop the nautical knowledge of the portuguese navigators . 
  in 1353 an agreement was made between pedro i of portugal and edward ii of england , in this agreement was given a permit for portuguese fishermen to fish codfish in the english coast at least until 1403 . 
  then in 1373 the portuguese-english treaty was made . 
  later between the final of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th , portuguese navigators would reach newfoundland ( in canada ) the codfish was so abundant in the area that they gave the name of `` terra nova do bacalhau '' ( newfoundland of codfish ) it was `` new '' because there was already a `` codfish land '' ... scandinavia . 
  the portuguese fishermen `` caught '' codfish in there ( newfoundland ) until 1974 . 
  so whenever you think something is hard to accomplish remember that the world would be a very different place if the portuguese did n't like codfish . 
  they crossed an ocean ( atlantic ) for more than 400 years just to catch codfish , it was one of the basis for the portuguese-english alliance still up nowadays and it was a source of nautical information trade between the portuguese navigators and the scandinavian navigators . 
  it 's probably a variation of `` codfish * \u00e0 br\u00e1s * '' ( bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s ) , tuna is a kind of fish that pretty much everybody likes , including children , so probably some people may change the codfish and put tuna instead . 
  yes , some of the dishes ( or at least similar ones ) can be eaten in both portugal and spain and in some extent all around the mediterranean . 
  [ check it yourself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/396lyy/portugal_part_ii_cuisine/ ) but yes , bacalhau is still our `` faithful friend '' . 
  [ part ii - cuisine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/396lyy/portugal_part_ii_cuisine/ ), 
   who is the guy on the horse ? 
  the guy on the horse is the king jos\u00e9 i ( joseph i of portugal ) , in 1755 an earthquake destroyed a great part of lisbon ( and some other parts of the country ) , ... so during the reconstruction of the city they placed that statue of the king on that `` square '' ( pra\u00e7a ) . 
   also why is the finnish cross randomly hanging from your castles ? 
  that 's not the finnish flag , but rather the [ first portuguese flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_portuguese_flags#historical_flags ) , and it 's hanging in that castle because it 's believed it was in that castle that our first king ( afonso henriques or afonso i of portugal ) was born .

  since we have such a diversity of dishes i decided to make a part ii only about the food ( that i will post later today ) but thanks for those 2 suggestions . 
  the more impressive thing is ... since when does germans know what is a joke ? 
  i thought they did n't know how to laugh . 
   let me just clarify that i was n't making an anti-semitic comment * no problemo * , i understood that , just clarifying that they 're indeed portuguese and not like refugees or immigrants . 
  and because they 're jews they are not portuguese ? 
  alheira was created by portuguese jews . 
  your religion does n't affect your nationality , you could be a catholic portuguese or a portuguese islamic but you could also be a catholic spaniard . 
  codfish is n't original from portugal but neither is tea originally from england but they still are one of the top consumers of it . 
  we eat codfish pretty much since the beginning of our independence and i 'm willing to say that we probably have far more codfish dishes than any scandinavian country . 
  pork is n't exclusive from portugal but for example we have the '' * alentejano * 's black pig '' which is very appreciated in portugal but also in spain . 
  sempre . 
   * flesh *  speed europe i hope they do a grood job . 
  * trianon digivolve !, 
  * * trianon is digivolving ... * * trianon digivolved to ... tetranon !, 
  [ it 's time for animaniacs and we 're zany to the max . 
  so just sit back and relax . 
  you 'll laugh 'til you collapse , we 're animaniacs !,

  but he spook english , did n't he ? 
  no , now you 're just playing stupid . 
  what he did ( and i ) was n't the same you did now . 
  one thing is write in your language ( in your case turkish ) and then with the english translation below , other is mixing both languages and expect people to understand it . 
  wrong , this is an european subreddit !, 
  the first dictator to use himself as the target ( of hate ) in order to get a group of people together . 
  multiculturalism does n't work in any country , in any place , of course it 's always better when we 're surrounded by people `` similar '' to us , it 's easy to make the first approach , to take the first step , to speak and to listen . 
  but in the real world we have to deal with different people , that 's how it rules . 
  for the rest you can always join a club , like a math club , europe club or in this case he can always join a hungary club where he and his hungarian friends could hang out without having the problem of dealing with people from other cultures . 
  buy a portuguese flag , it has a f * ckin ' golden globe ( armillary sphere ) like saying `` we rule this sh * t and we have gold enough to cover all this sh * t , caralho ! '', 
  ... well , of course in reality is quiet the opposite but a man can dream . 
   the official unemployment rate is around 45 % , but it 's actually much closer to 25 % since many people who are considered unemployed work `` illegally '' . 
  but then you would have to count those people in the other countries too , i think every country as that people , specially because they still get the unemployment allowance/benefit and plus some money for their odd jobs ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ know ^ ^ if ^ ^ that ^ ^ is ^ ^ the ^ ^ correct ^ ^ english ^ ^ term ... 
  people say that we speak kind of slavic they just wan na to confirm it personal .
