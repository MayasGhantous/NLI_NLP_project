  * who is gon na be the world champion , the master of them all , the supreme global ruler of football ? 
  stay tune at bbc-dot-com and find out which european country is going to win *, 
  and technically even the other half ( the bishop ) is chosen by another country , vatican . 
  so they have 2 leaders and non of them are elected by the people of andorra , but well ... it 's kinda working , right ? 
  yes , but those are outside so they probably avoid to use wood , right ? 
  and i should specified that when i said it i was referring to portugal only and do n't know if the techniques are equal everywhere , but thanks for the info . 
  edit : the portuguese gilded woodcarving might be somehow a specific case of gilded woodcarving since it has their own [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilded_woodcarving_in_portugal ), 
  you could join portugal , at least for one day , then during that day we could all joke with spain and you ( galicians ) could also piss off with catalans and basques for them still being part of spain . 
  we would all send letters to felipe saying simple things like `` lol '' and stuff like that . 
  it 's a technique called gilded woodcarving . 
  in fact many times those `` golden churches '' are in fact less expensive to build than others ( with the interior made of marble for example ) , since the gold you see is n't pure gold but rather `` leaves '' of gold placed over wood ( i 'm not sure if it 's always over wood , but general it was ) . 
   portugal gained independence as duchy of oporto from galicia , not castilla . 
  i do n't quiet understand this quote , care to explain ? 
   not trying to say portugal is spain but we have our common history and roots , too . 
  spain is the the result of the union of different iberian peoples anyway . 
  only portugal is left and it still was a `` branch '' from galicia . 
  yes , i understand what you said , it 's a bit strange that they called it espa\u00f1a even despite the fact that portugal was n't part of it . 
  ... unless they 're prophets waiting for the birth of their grandson , [ miguel da paz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_da_paz,_prince_of_portugal ) :p anyway , it kinda makes sense , it was still the majority of the peninsula . 
  but if we ever unite we need to change the name to iberia , 
  well goa and macau are outside of europe so they do n't really count for the `` at least in europe ( ... ) unchanged borders '' but yes you 're right about san marino , andorra i 'm not quiet sure . 
  about olivenza i think when someone says `` border changes '' it 's probably something bigger than a city between the border of 2 countries , otherwise almost all europe would have had similar cases for example during the french invasions or during wwi and wwii where cities passed from side to side . 
  and besides that the portuguese states does n't recognize the sovereignty of spain over olivenza , so technically it 's still considered part of portugal ( even despite the fact that nobody cares about it ) even the maps in portuguese schools place olivenza in spain , but for example in the `` border '' between portugal and olivenza there are no border landmarks in the portuguese side , the border landmarks are used as indication for where is the border of a country . 
  but i think that portugal is like the 3rd or something like that with the oldest unchanged borders ... 
  spain ? 
  - we do n't have * siestas * . 
  - we also drink sangria , in fact it can only be sold with that name ( `` sangria '' ) if it 's made in spain or made in portugal . 
  - portugal gained is independence from the kingdom of `` le\u00f3n and castilla '' not from spain . 
  portugal = 1143 , spain = 1479 - the royal family run away to brazil during the french invasions ( of napoleon ) but the country was n't ever conquered by the french troops , even despite the fact that they tried for 3 times , of course we had the help of the english soldiers too . 
  - spain had their inquisition , and we also had ours . 
  - francisco de almeida , a portuguese nobleman , soldier and explorer once in 1509 after winning the [ battle of diu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_diu_ ( 1509 \\ ) ) against the mamluk sultunate ( and others ) , the egyptian captives are burned alive , hanged and even tied up to mouths of the cannons and then bombarded against the city , this was mainly in revenge of his son died 2 years before in a battle against the mamluks . 
  - an worst case happen , when the portuguese navigator vasco da gama , one day in his second voyage to india captured a ship and ordered it to be burn , happens that the ship was a merchant ship , with 400 passengers , including 200 pilgrims from mecca , including women and children and to make it worst the boat did n't burn immediately , they ( the muslims ) tried to extinguish the fire and so all that burning scenario lasted for a couple of days . 
  yeah , they 're crazy like that at the time . 
  after that he captured 30 fishermen , dismembered them and placed their bodies part in the river tide so that their families could found them . 
  - portugal did n't intervened directly in the ww ii but [ they did help a bit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_air_ferry_route_in_world_war_ii ) and this was one of the main reason why portugal is one of the original members of nato . 
  - in 1514 a portuguese embassy was sent to the pope with several offerings , including : 300 draft horses covered with silk blankets ; 300 draft horses covered with a superb fine wool padding ; bowmen riding horses ; a persian horse ridden by a hormuz ( persia ) hunter , with a tamed panther lying in the rump of the horse ; macaws and monkeys from brazil ; silk tissues from persia ; a white elephant called hanno covered up with solid gold trims , obeying his trainer to do some tricks ; and several chests with gold and diamonds . 
  the embassador/leader of this embassy was the portuguese explorer trist\u00e3o da cunha ( the island is named after him ) - in 1511 a portuguese ship called `` flor de la mar '' sunk , the main reason was all the cargo aboard . 
  the estimated value of the cargo ( according with today prices ) ? 
  2600000000 $ or c. 2400000000 $ . 
  - [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/igreja_de_s%c3%a3o_francisco_01.jpg ) for example is a church in portugal ( of course not all of them are like that ), 
  they used to fish mostly on newfoundland , but then around 1950 the number of cod in those waters started to get lower and lower and so they got a cut in the quota of fish they could catch , this affected the portuguese fishermen but also the spaniards and french because the cod that they could fish sometimes was n't even enough to pay for all the fishermen , voyage and boat reparations . 
  i would gess thats mainly because of the different prices between uk and italy , the same amount of people , buying the same amount of things probably spend more money in uk than in italy ... i do n't know ... 
  portuguese fishermen used to go fish for cod in canada ( newfoundland ) like since the year ~ 1500 they even called it `` terra do bacalhau '' ( cod fish land ) , so yes , our relation with cod fish is like the british people with tea . 
  with the taxes and corruption , we should do a high-ten instead . 
  you put both hands on the hair , you go on for the impact against my hands , right on the beggining the governement says `` wait ... you must pay finger tax ! '', 
  and you give them 3 fingers , now we 're going to a `` high-seven '' , but when our hands are almost crashing against each other a corrupt politician takes 2 fingers away , now we do a `` high-five '' . 
  sometimes i feel that portugal and spain are simply a mirror of each other . 
  not a perfect mirror of course . 
  - cavaco silva , presidente de portugal `` what needs to be done so that more children are born in portugal ? '', 
  - cavaco silva , president of portugal, 
  me neither . 
  one day i shower , another take a bath . 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  unless you 're from southern europe , we do n't turn into lobsters xd, 
  i like most of the work from mozart , even the * crazy * ones like [ difficile lectu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=strlabub64s ) and also the nutcracker from tchaikovsky . 
  but since i 'm portuguese , let me show you a portuguese composer from the beginning of the xviii century , carlos seixas . 
  - [ harpsichord concerto in a major ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoocxj4beo4 ) - [ harpsichord sonata no . 
  24 in d minor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iek5ozlqklu ), 
  portugal is number one !, 
  ... number one of the last ones , again , probably . 
  would n't it be better if it was the opposite ? 
  ukraine sending solar panels to western europe . 
  i mean solar time is higher in italy , spain , portugal , ... than in ukraine . 
  of course the energy produced in those western europe countries would then be shared with ukraine . 
  we 're already used to it in portugal , so ... go on mate , let 's do it !, 
  is n't the `` mente '' in the word a suffix or it 's just coincidence ? 
  i 'm saying this because in portuguese most of the times when the word ends with `` mente '' that 's a suffix , not sure if the same happens in italian . 
  emel and antral in portugal ^ ^ jk , ^ ^ or ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ not ... 
  because it 's always a happy europe day in europe . 
  portuguese movies : - [ capit\u00e3o falc\u00e3o ( captain falcon ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfbedw-wwmg ) ( you can activate the subtitles if they are n't already ) - [ capit\u00e3es de abril ( april captains ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2mjxj06kho ) ( i will try to find a trailer with english subtitles ) - [ linhas de wellington ( lines of wellington ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cix-104pyyg ) - [ filme da treta ( ~ bullshit movie ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnl-nj3mvk ) ( once again without subtitles ) - [ gaiola dourada ( gilded cage ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkhw9psacei ), 
  well , not even the portuguese people would trust portugal , but they sure do n't hate us and i hope that they do n't think we 're all lazy people that only want to party , but rather that we had some bad governments and politics that ruined the economy . 
  remember when finland did n't want to help portugal getting out of crisis ? 
  it 's kind of ironic to see that their gdp is decreasing when in other hand the portuguese is increasing . 
  but anyway , the fault was n't of the finnish people , but rather from the finnish government and the portuguese one ( since nobody would trust them at least at the time ) . 
  / r/portugalcaralho [ spanish-portuguese wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish%e2%80%93portuguese_war ), 
  - thank you spain for not trying to invade us again . 
  - thank you france , switzerland and germany for giving jobs to the portuguese emigrants . 
  - thank you norway for the delicious cod fish . 
  - thank you greece for not letting us be the worst economy of europe . 
  - thank you italy for the pizza , lasagna , etc. . . that i eat while in university . 
  - thank you vatican for supporting us since 1179 - thank you australia ... oh wait , you are n't european , almost forgot it . 
  for a moment i thought i was reading a text about portuguese agriculture , well ... close enough , good luck neighbor . 
   and , honestly , not all people work in an office with air conditioning . 
  some offices do n't have air conditioning , and some people still have to work in the fields . 
  yes , of course  i just wanted to point that now is more a matter of `` cultural ties '' rather than the actual weather . 
  but yes , there are still plenty of people working in rural areas , in the fields . 
  [ do n't leave uk !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfphzonkcw8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m37s ) for the good old times !, 
  the perfect eu would be the anyone that truly understands the saying : `` all different , all equal '' . 
  sure the spaniards like to sleep the `` siesta '' , but for pete 's sake , it 's probably 40\u00bac in some places there today ( well at least is close to that in the portuguese border ) sure nowadays everybody works in a office with air conditioning but you ca n't except them to `` forget '' a tradition from the night to the day . 
  the people from south europe spend a lot of time in the bathroom while on work and in the lunch break , but if you earned 500 $ ( or maybe even lesser than that if you worked as `` green receipts '' ) and had no productivity bonus whatsoever , you probably would n't be that motivated to work in a factory that makes tuna cans . 
  sure we like to party , who does n't like to have some bunga-bunga parties ? 
  but here in portugal we 've a saying : `` trabalho \u00e9 trabalho , conhaque \u00e9 conhaque '' ( work is work , brandy is brandy ) which means that one thing is work and another are the parties , you 've time to both . 
  what i mean is south europe is n't equal to north europe , neither is eastern equal to western ; portuguese people ca n't act like swedish and neither finnish can act like italians , but one thing is for sure , each one on is own way wants the best for europe and for the union , some people are good as architects , others at civil engineers and some as builders , electricians , etc. . . but every single one of those is needed to build a house , an house called `` european ^ ^ fuckin ' union '', 
  but ... but we did it first :( we want to be a nordic country too , we want to be rich and most of all to have lots of cod fish on our coast . 
  portugal could disguise himself as a nordic country if we used our [ original flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/portugueseflag1095.png ), 
  portugal is tiny , right ? 
  i do n't want to be an hypocrital bullshiter ... 
  neither in portugal , i was joking . 
  but we do like our galician friends , 
  `` portuguese were galicians with an army . '',
