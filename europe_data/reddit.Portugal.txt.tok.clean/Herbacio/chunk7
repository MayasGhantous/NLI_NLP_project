  many people from portugal still do n't `` really '' like spain ( they do n't hate them ... but do n't like them either ) but with galicia is completely different , we like them . 
  [ portuguese-spanish border ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qccncdato5q/s3ngqt34tzi/aaaaaaaabew/0tpio87_l8g/s1600/p8281333.jpg ) [ another one ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/34171/20050727pt_paradamonte.jpg ) [ and another ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/setembro2006_021.jpg ) portuguese vandalism = helping galicia to free themselves from spain xd, 
  are you afraid of [ greater portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal ) ?!, 
  the mighty empire that would spread from galicia ( northwest of spain ) into algarve ( south of portugal ) , in madeira and azores , and in cape verde and s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and pr\u00edncipe . 
  fear us !, 
  fear portugaliza !, 
  are you not afraid yet ?!, 
  ... well , do n't be . 
  nobody cares about greater portugal . 
  taking in account that the portuguese cuisine is n't that widespread and must of the times is mixed with the spanish cuisine , i would say that they did a good job , but off course there is always space to progress ( for example the menu had some orthographic mistakes ), 
  i 've seen know the facebook page of the [ `` cimarella '' ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/cimarella/261050003495?sk=timeline ) where they had the `` portuguese '' cuisine . 
  in one video that they put in their page , you can even hear a portuguese music , in that case is [ `` um lugar ao sol from delfins '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvpb3-r0jgo ), 
  i do n't know if there are more examples like these : [ jos\u00e9 posada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_posada ) [ camilo nogueira rom\u00e1n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camilo_nogueira_rom%c3%a1n ) basically they spoke `` galician '' in the european parliament . 
  this is * my representation * of what happen :  european union : `` are you speaking galician ? 
  you know that is n't an official language ''  galician politic : `` yeah , i know , i 'm speaking portuguese ''  european union : `` portuguese ? 
  it does n't seems so ... ''  galician politic : `` well , it 's ... it 's a portuguese dialect ''  european union : `` oh ... ok , carry on '', 
  i had this book in my school library , it was quiet nice . 
  or for a more portuguese emphasis : `` feliz dia da europa a todos , * caralho * ! '', 
   i agree but i do n't think there are a lot of people that believe portugal is a province of spain yes , i was just emphasizing that i was n't making the joke `` portugal is part of spain '' but rather speaking that people think spain culture is more or less equal to portuguese culture , and like i said in the end even the beaches are different despite being all in the south of the peninsula . 
  well , of course there are some similarities between both countries , they have been influenced by romans and moors , but there are also many differences and that 's why it 's always worth to see both countries . 
  i upvoted this , and i 'm glad that spain is at the top , well ... it would be better if it was portugal since i 'm portuguese , but being our neighbor is also good . 
  many people think that portugal and spain are the same thing , not the portugal is a province of spain , but that they have equal cultures , same dishes , same people , etc. . . and so , when they visit one of those countries most of the times they end up only in that country despite the fact that they have plenty of time to visit the other . 
  in 2 weeks , more or less , you can visit all the `` top '' places in iberia/hispania , and the marvelous thing is that in such a short time you can go to the beaches in algarve and andaluzia , the mountains of serra da estrela and sierra nevada , go to lisbon and madrid , porto and barcelona , etc. . . you may say `` ah but , the beaches are all the same '' , nothing more wrong , algarve 's waters are from atlantic ocean , andaluzia 's waters are from the mediterranean sea , even the sand is different . 
  promoting spanish tourism is also helping to promote portuguese tourism and vice versa . 
  both countries ( and let 's not forget andorra ) should work together in order to `` attract '' more tourists to these european peninsula . 
  yes , that 's the one . 
  i live in a small village of portugal near the municipality of [ our\u00e9m ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/our%c3%a9m ) and also close to [ f\u00e1tima ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a1tima,_portugal ) there is n't that much of historical information about any village around our\u00e9m , mainly because of the french invasion , many documents are burn and robbed at the time , but we do know that around 1750 we ( my village ) already had a church with a brotherhood ( group of people in charge of take care of the church and things related with christianity in the village ) . 
  the village was probably formed with farmers and shepherds that worked around the castle of our\u00e9m in order to provide them food . 
  according with documents the population received during historical times a considerable amount of austrian immigrants . 
  probably he meant christian ... 
  `` we are in a comparable state , correlative with greece : same poverty , the same political indignity , even lowering of characters , same public thievery , same usury , same decadence of mind , the same grotesque administration of sloppiness and confusion . 
  in foreign books , magazines , when you want to talk about a catholic country and for its progressive decay is likely to be wiped off the map - cite to the couple greece and portugal ( ... ) '' - e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3s , 1872 . 
  - friendship , mutual help and peace ; - equality in rights and duties ; - ... 
  since when did he said that he was speaking in name of the `` portuguese '' ? 
  stop with that bullshit racism through the western europeans . 
  it 's funny to see that we 're a `` 3rd world country '' like you say , but many british , dutch and germans still choose portugal to spend their reform , if scandinavia is so great why do n't they choose it either ? 
  oh , of course , we 're a third world country so the prices are much lower here . 
  but wait , if life is so much better in any scandinavian country , i 'm really surprised by the fact that in general the suicide rate is higher there than in portugal . 
  i do n't even know from what country you 're , but one thing is for sure , at least one person from there is a pathetic human being who judges a whole country based on a comment from another person . 
  yes . 
  - spanish-venezuela ( amazonas & bolivar ) ; - english-guyana ; - dutch-suriname ; - french-french guyana ; - portuguese-brazil ( amap\u00e1 ), 
  [ yeah , you got it right  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ) it was a revolution made entirely made in portugal with no support of any other country ( which is comprehensible since outside of portugal the world really did n't knew about our situation , we lived `` orgulhosamente s\u00f3s '' ( proudly alone ) like salazar ( the portuguese dictator said ) ) the dictatorship lasted for more than 40 years ; with censorship , torture , exile , colonial wars and starvation . 
  but then the `` estado novo '' ends , portugal leaves all the colonies ( besides macau , which lasted until 1999 and some may say also east timor until 2002 ) then years later enters on the european union , a country that lived 40 years closed to themselves and 500 years `` facing '' his colonies is know looking to europe , people are n't used to that , we 're never `` europeans '' , we 're citizens of the world , like a [ portuguese priest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_vieira ) said in the xvii century : `` god gave the portuguese a small country as a cradle but all the world as their grave '', 
  i thought he was referring to uk , that 's why i made the question , 
  do you know what is celebrated today in portugal ? 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ easy ... 
  when was that ? 
  all nations in the world have suffered at some point of history with mass murder , instead of making `` honor days '' just because it 's the political correct in this moment we should be working to prevent those events to happen again . 
  enough with the pseudo - `` je suis charlie '' that brag about equality and liberty but then do nothing in reality . 
  never let s\u00e1tur shoot the crossbow , it 's the basic rule of \u00c1guila roja .

  1 ) can you get me some norwegian cod fish ( daily ) ? 
  2 ) do i have discounts in ikea ? 
  since i 'm portuguese i would say no , but it really depends on what languages do you know already . 
  for example , if you know spanish than it will be a little easier to learn portuguese . 
  but in terms of speaking they 're very different ( well , at least more than you would except ) , like people usually see a portuguese sounds like a `` drunk russian trying to speak spanish '' , we write like latins but speak like slavs , in other hand romanians write like slavs but speak like latins . 
  btw , if you need some help look into the `` portuguese language '' subreddit : / r/portuguese or if you need some help about portugal ( maybe about your holidays ) you 've / r/portugal ,

  yeah cool city , with nice beaches and good weather overall , i used to go there in the summer with my parents , but not anymore , i really do n't like beach that much ... ^ ^ i ^ ^ swear ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ vampire !, 
  nice  so ... is it lisbon or algarve ?

  `` everybody else '' includes portuguese people ? 
  is that `` tail '' on south of portugal the town of olivenza ? 
  gibraltar national football team have been playing their `` home '' games in [ portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/est%c3%a1dio_algarve ) due to their stadium being too small ( to receive the uefa 2016 qualifications games ), 
  if they 're pushed out by the spaniards then they must have drown in the mediterranean sea :p, 
  you 're [ madness ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=iranzd9a6l4 ) !, 
  i do n't think that they 're the predecessors of morocco , but anyway i said `` out of here '' not `` out of the world '' , 
  what 's that ? 
  ca n't find it on the map ... i remember something like that but we get them out of here like 8 centuries ago ... 
  i live in `` people with manners '' , * caralho * que orgulho !, 
   out of interest , how does this impact uk , argentina and falklands ? 
  well , according with the treaty the west part of the world would be part of spain , and so argentina claims that since they 're successors of the spanish empire they 're the rightful owners of the falklands , or something like that . 
  [ link ] ( http://thefalklandsproject.com/#treaty-of-tordesillas ) even chile used it as a justification for their claims in the antarctica . 
   in the twentieth century , the treaty has been dredged up by chile as justification for sovereignty over antarctica , with lines being drawn directly south from the eastern and western boundaries of the nation in a triangular claim over those distant and uninhabitable lands . 
  argentina has also listed the treaty of tordesillas as the foundation for its claim that the falkland islands form part of its sovereign territory because they fall in the spanish half of the world . 
  both nations made the unprecedented assertion that they had inherited from spain the benefits and rights of the treaty after their wars of independence . 
  ^ [ link here ] ( http://www.thehistoryreader.com/medieval-history/treaty-tordesillas-1494-decision-still-influencing-todays-world/ ), 
  in one hand i can see why portugal would support argentina .
