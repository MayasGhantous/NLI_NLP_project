  one of the arguments used by argentinians is the treaty of tordesillas ( and their successors ) which are made by portugal and spain , and in fact they never ceased , which means that if tomorrow spain tried to colonize a country that could n't be , for example , brazil unless they want to break the treaty with portugal . 
  but in other hand portugal is a very long ally with the brits and it 's hard to believe that portugal would be against uk in any matter/thing in discussion . 
  meh ... i 've seen a lot of signals like these with misprinted names ... but yes , i can totally see what you mean . 
  it appears that the link is n't working now . 
  so [ there 's a new ( working ) one ] ( https://fronterasblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/olivenza1.jpg?w=450 ), 
  [ see if it 's ok now ] ( https://fronterasblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/olivenza1.jpg?w=450 ) , sorry for the inconvenience . 
  strange , i was watching it on the mobile maybe it 's because of that . 
  just wait a moment i 'll give you a `` working '' link right away . 
  oh sorry , look up [ there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza#claims_of_sovereignty ) . 
  you 're confusing portuguese empire with the sahara desert that belonged to the french empire :p, 
   portugal : they are poor ; they eat cod at every meal . 
  well ... that 's kind true . 
  probably it was the dead of [ miguel da paz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_da_paz,_prince_of_portugal ) , he was the heir to the throne of portugal , castille and aragon ( which was basically all the iberian peninsula and of course plus their colonies ) , however the kid died with only 2 years , and later , lesser then 100 years after that , philip ii of spain took control over portugal and so forming an iberian union . 
   portugal -- part of puerto rico, 
  but ... but ... you said it to now :( [ desculpa ] ( http://www.petiscos.com/lista_receitas.php?catid=10&amp;lang=0&amp;ordena=1 ), 
  \u00e0 grande e \u00e0 ~ ~ francesa ~ ~ portuguesa, 
  bro , we 're gon na control the oceans once again , 
  it 's the same thing , but less hairy . 
  well in portugal they 're not pro-german but neither are anti-german . 
  omelette du fromage could be translated as `` cheese omelette '' so we could say it 's a dish . 
  punheta de bacalhau is also a dish , a portuguese dish . 
  in which the name translated to english is `` cod 's wank '' ( cod fish ), 
  only for left-parties ... 
  more like `` punheta de bacalhau '',

  the [ irish anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrzatp157ki ) of course ... 
  i 'm from portugal the western country in continental europe and ... nope we do n't hate east europeans . 
  no , we do n't hate germans , what we do n't like is that our government tries to make things like they do in german or french when we 're not the same . 
  i mean , i would n't have a problem with paying more taxes if the money was to improve education , health , ... but nope , corruption all over it . 
  we do n't even hate our neighbors ( spain ) , of course we make some jokes but nothing more than that . 
  as other eastern europe people , like ukrainians , romanians , etc. . . we 've nothing against them either . 
  but , perhaps there are some west europeans that hate east europeans , as well as the inverse but not the majority and not even anything close to it . 
  and what special freedom is that ? 
  being the wealthiest does n't means being the most powerful and neither being the one with greater army makes a country powerful but rather the combination of both factors ( and others such as human rights ), 
  the catalans and the brits got downvoted ... in a post about spain ... ... that 's strange , very strange ... oh wait , no it is n't . 
  we are n't . 
  it 's just a * joke * ... 
  it 's an `` exclave peninsula '' xd, 
  but ... but , it is portuguese ... 
  almost like the * portuguese * exclaves of oliven\u00e7a ^ ^ olivenza and talega ^ ^ tal\u00edga in spain . 
  :p ps : and thanks , til too . 
  a greek , a portuguese and a german walked into a reddit post ... `` portugal will blame albania about some sh ** !, 
  lol '' , says the greek . 
  '' , says the portuguese . 
  `` lol '' , replies the german , and proceeds saying : '' ... and now give me my money back you scumbags ! '', 
  easy there jo\u00e3o connery !, 
  oh sorry forgot to put the / s , i was making a `` dictators '' joke . 
  [ franco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisco_franco ) and of course [ mussolini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benito_mussolini ), 
   although 5 of eu countries do n't recognize kosovo republic , four of them ( excluding spain ) recognize kosovo passports . 
  and in this matter spain `` really '' does n't counts since they probably know that recognizing kosovo would be a boost for the independence movements in catalunya and basque country, 
  but what about mussolini-german relationship ? 
   why portugal has one less hour than spain this really seems like a question our galician brothers would made . 
  back in 1383 portugal had a succession crisis , and of course spain invaded the territory , in 1385 the battle of aljubarrota happens ... 
  the portuguese army was composed by ~ 6500 men , including 100 english longbowmen ( but no knights ) while castile had 31000 ( almost 5x more than portugal ) including more than 2000 french heavy knights and 15 mortars ( something never used before against portuguese troops at the time ) but castile would end up losing the battle with between 4000 and 5000 soldiers killed . 
  the rest of the castilian soldiers ran away , however , in the aftermath of the battle , during the night and the next day , around 5000 of them were killed by the neighbouring inhabitants , including 7 by a single woman ... a baker from aljubarrota . 
  portuguese food  oliven ** \u00e7 ** a food  ceuta food  galician food  all other food . 
  we 're the fastest hedgehog in europe !, 
  i simply ca n't make a `` portuguese version '' of a map like this because either the results are from questions made by brazilians or in some cases google even completes the sentence with spanish words ( probably due to the fact that i 'm * close * to the border ), 
  unless ~ ~ napoleon ~ ~ hollande tries to invade our peninsula, 
  good one turkey , perhaps you could join eu, 
  by this time we had 2 ( 3 ) christian kingdoms in iberian peninsula : asturias ( with galicia being a vassal kingdom ) and navarre . 
  the county of portugal already existed at the time , so technically people from that area could identify themselves as `` portuguese '' however when speaking about their `` country '' they would probably say galicia ( or even asturias ) but since this about the general population in iberian peninsula we had the moors and the hispanics . 
   how do you know this for sure ? 
  it seems like a dismissive explanation . 
  nobody can know for sure , but the thing is the right-wing extremists parties are n't exactly raising in portugal ( and much less at the time of the voting ) , no one really argues that salazar was a great economist and some other things and of course many people voted on him for `` real '' but this was kind of debated at the time , and jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates at the time was being `` investigated '' due to irregularities in his degree in civil enginery , 2 years before the freeport scandal raised into the news , and also for pressuring journalists and ( trying to ) censorship some them . 
   so the country is very divided . 
  well , we can argue that country is divided between right and left , but it 's more between center-right ( psd ) and center-left ( ps ) most of the communists voted for cunhal , while let say someone from psd may have voted for afonso henriques , another one for vasco da gama and other in jo\u00e3o ii etc. . . 
  the voting for the `` greatest portuguese '' was made by the public television ( rtp 1 ) while s\u00f3crates was the prime-minister and during a time where the crisis was rising in portugal , so most of the votes are `` protesting '' votes , like saying `` we would prefer to be in a dictatorship than under this `` banana republic '' '' , it 's also important to notice that the 2nd most voted was \u00c1lvaro cunhal historical leader of the portuguese communist party . 
  t. alberto barbosa, 
   but i 'm poor . 
  i thought poor germans are like an unicorn , a myth , something that we can only witness in scotland after some whiskeys ... 
  you 're called iberia . 
  hispania -  spain . 
  one is greek another in latin but the same thing , you should change the name to reino de castilla y le\u00f3n , arag\u00f3n , galicia , etc. . . 
  best thing about spain is that they have quite nice neighbors like : portugal , uk ( gibraltar ) , andorra and even morocco . 
  i could bet that at least a few of those children either like to eat cod fish or paella, 
  but why would they do that ? 
  `` nobody '' cries when a politician dies , however if `` you '' kill a dozen of civilian , of poor innocent and random civilians then everybody is going to at least change their facebook profile photo and talk about it for a week or two . 
  sometimes even * irm\u00e1ns * have little discussions , it 's normal . 
  [ biedronka ] ( http://www.jeronimomartins.pt/media/330299/biedronka_store.jpg ) is owned by a portuguese corporate group called [ jer\u00f3nimo martins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jer%c3%b3nimo_martins ) .

  [ ramirez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservas_ramirez ) their benelux brand is called [ cocagne ] ( http://alpha.beta.pnh.pt/userfiles/images/tonijn_in_olijfolie-1359568224-1604194352.png ) in usa , canada and philipines it 's [ tom\u00e9 ] ( http://alpha.beta.pnh.pt/userfiles/images/sardines_in_vegetable_oil-1360520070-500554103.png ) [ al fares ] ( http://alpha.beta.pnh.pt/userfiles/images/al-fares_portuguese_spiced_sardines_in_vegetable_oil-1372776772-156865679.png ) in the arab world for south africa is [ gabriel ] ( http://alpha.beta.pnh.pt/userfiles/images/portuguese_sardine_fillets_in_olive_oil-1359047958-605623291.png ) and many others . 
  they sell around 25 millions cans around the world each year ( excluding portugal ), 
  let 's all be friends !, 
  finally the russians !, 
  at least they can understand portuguese , right ? 
  right ? 
  they really do n't like pigs ... 
  * unida en la diversidad ... well , not us . 
  but is it the same in switzerland ? 
  yes , both are based in the name of pax julia, 
  it 's all true what you say , but you know that sadly still many people do it, 
  but one thing is the law and another is what you do . 
  even if the bus driver checked all the students at the beginning of the ride , they could simply take them off while he was already driving , and plus in this case those are erasmus students therefore also adults . 
  i really thought you had already surpassed us . 
  portugal is basically a geographical mistake , we 're eastern europeans : the country is poor , we sound like russians , the government is supported by the communist party , we 're sad people , ... 
   so , mostly western countries they all seem eastern to me ,
