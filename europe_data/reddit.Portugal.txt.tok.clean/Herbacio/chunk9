  but , according to `` wikipedia '' :  it ( * that poem * ) is widely regarded as an introduction to voltaire 's later acclaimed work candide, 
  as the dying voices call out , will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with , `` this is the necessary effect of the eternal laws freely chosen by god '' ? 
  seeing this mass of victims , will you say , `` god is avenged . 
  their death is the price of their crimes '' ? 
  what crime , what fault had the young commited , who lie bleeding at their mother 's breast ? 
  did fallen lisbon indulge in more vices than london or paris , which live in pleasure ? 
  lisbon is no more , but they dance in paris . 
  this report makes me unhappy :(, 
  i think psv fans are also quite uncommon in madrid , but you do n't see spaniards disrespecting them , that is simply bad behaviour , which unfortunately exists a bit ( from ) every . 
  [ alves dos reis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alves_dos_reis ) in 1924 , he falsified 500 `` escudos '' banknotes , in a total value of 100 million escudos ( equivalent to 0.88 % of portugal 's nominal gdp at the time ) he `` simply '' falsified documents and with the help of some more people they made `` waterlow and sons limited '' at the time a worlwide engraver of banknotes , etc. . . to print portuguese banknotes . 
  this lead to a financial crisis , with all the 500esc banknotes getting out of circulation in portugal ( either they 're falsified or note ) . 
  that crisis would aggravate the economical situation of portugal even more , and so in 1926 a coup d'\u00c9tat which would eventually start the portuguese dictatorship ( estado novo ) edit : yeah , it 's not a `` ponzi scheme '' , but still , an interesting case . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  we 're poor like eastern-europe and we speak `` slavic '' like eastern-eruope . 
   portugese is like a pistol language shotgun . 
  could you explain that ? 
  we do it before it , he drinks during the sacrament , and then joins us after the sacrament . 
  [ this ] ( http://imagens.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/497455?tp=km&amp;db=imagens&amp;w=1160 ) was the life for most women at the time in portugal . 
  agriculture . 
  some other would help the husband with the fishery , etc. . . [ and this ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7449/1901/1600/neg%208.0.jpg ) was the `` car '' for most people and even for some people in lisbon . 
  speaking of [ lisbon ] ( http://www.musee-aquitaine-bordeaux.fr/sites/musee-aquitaine.fr/files/images/event/3409-20a-_portugal_1966_-__0.jpg ) the point is , yes british have n't been always `` quite well off '' but still when you compare them with the rest of the world do you really think they lived that bad ? 
  i mean your 5th photo with the houses , at that time many people of portugal lived in houses made of rock , some still live , they freeze during the winter . 
  the photo with kids playing football , only rich people would have such a `` nice '' ball like that in portugal . 
  they 're poor compared with nowadays , but if you compare the brits with the rest of europe and the world at the time , well ... they probably are n't that poor . 
  and in this case pretty much all of it is a real story . 
  it 's not . 
  stop saying such things about catholicism . 
  ... here we drink * wine * with the local priest . 
  it 's a city . 
  but yes , i do agree with , i live nearby and unless you go in 13th may , 13th august or 13th october nothing really happens . 
  i 'm not religious , but the 13th of october is kind nice , with all the people at night with the candles ( same in may , but it has too many people ), 
  if we 're talking about the world , jokes aside , i would say galician , yes that language spoke by some people in northwest spain . 
  spanish people can understand them fairly well , same goes for the portuguese one . 
  this means you can speak with people from brazil , venezuela or angola all countries with oil industry . 
  mozambique , cape verde or equatorial guinea countries in need of engineers , architects , etc. 
  and many more places : argentina , east timor , macau , mexico , ... most of south america is developing and the same goes for some african countries and they all need specialized people to do certain high skill jobs, 
  is not surprising , that 's why i pointed out wwii , like you said central-eastern europe have been the center of the `` geo-political '' europe during the last centuries and seems like it 's going to be that way for some more time . 
  forecast for ** europe ** : number of times countries have been mentioned : - germany : 11 - poland : 6 - russia : 3 ( +1 moscow ) - usa : 2 ( +1 washington ) - ukraine : 2 - uk : 1 - belarus : 1 - romania : 1 with so many germany , poland , russia and usa , i had to recheck the title to see if was n't in / r/history reading some article about wwii, 
  i think the main reason it 's the possibility of uk leaving the eu . 
  without the uk the european union is going to be `` too much into the east '' . 
  it would n't be a surprise if more members leaved the eu if the british did so . 
  you 're from romania ? 
  yes , true . 
   they 've been spanish for 600-700 years they 've been spanish since 1580/1640 so ... at maximum for 480 years . 
  however i do agree with you . 
  we have to go back before 1415 to find `` north-african '' rulers in there , and even before that visigoths ( who also ruled in iberia ) and vandals ruled that area . 
  in portugal we call it monte branco , so ... can we dispute that too ? 
  portugal was kind of ruined by stupidity and things like that pretty much for 873 years ( and still counting ) . 
  still a long way to go though . 
  typical portuguese attitude : - `` portuguese people are dumb . 
  except me '', 
  do you really prefer to have the british as an enemy rather than the french or germans ? 
  in portugal one of the things we learn in history classes is that while the british did helped us `` many '' times , what happen was that while one hand was beating the spaniards or the frenchs the other hand was making pillages around portugal . 
  there 's an expression in portugal to designate a `` false friend '' ( someone that is n't a true/loyal friend ) : - `` amigos de peniche '' ( friends from peniche ( a city in portugal ) ) and the origin is from the time portugal was under spanish rule , in 1589 an army commanded by robert devereux arrived in peniche in order to march over lisbon and take down the spanish govern of portugal , the news spread into lisbon where the portuguese people waited for their english friends coming from peniche , but in their run into lisbon the british soldiers pillaged a few villages/cities and for an even bigger disgrace they could n't defeat the spaniards and help portugal . 
  yes , there 's some kind of `` pan-nationalism '' because we share similar roots and our `` language '' is similar , specially between people in northern portugal and galicia . 
  there 's not many population in the border between portugal and spain , so obviously there is n't much contact between portuguese and spanish , with the exception of northern portugal with northwest spain ( galicia ) . 
  we 're not the illuminatis or the british empire trying to break down spain , we like them , it 's just that . 
  what ? 
  we ( portuguese ) say galiza because while it is indeed part of spain we do n't feel a close connection through all spain but only to that specific region . 
  everybody knows that galiza is n't a country . 
  ** ^ ^ ^ ^ lol, 
  breakfast : it really depends on what hours i have classes . 
  so ... between 8am and 12pm . 
  lunch : 12pm-14pm dinner : 19pm-21pm, 
  but everybody `` promises '' things , there 's a difference between `` promising '' and doing the stuff for real . 
  but ... what about the dogs ? 
  this one is the [ 25th of april bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_de_abril_bridge ) ( ponte 25 de abril ) and was made by the american bridge company the same ones that made the [ san francisco -- oakland bay bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_francisco%e2%80%93oakland_bay_bridge ) , since this bridge is similar to the famous golden gate bridge the fact that `` 25th april '' was painted red gives it an even more similar look to the golden bridge . 
  some people would disagree about the `` national identity '' even nowadays , but i get what you say , 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_aneggmvy8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=35s ), 
  only 3rd hand ? 
  usually they 're already 3rd ... 4th or 5th hand when we buy them . 
  you got lucky latin bro ' !, 
  similar story happen in portugal . 
  i was just giving a `` fictional example '', 
  in percentage it 's probably higher than anywhere else . 
  but like it was said there are as much `` places '' in galiza alone than in the rest of spain ; the spanish population is highly concentrated , while in france you may have 10 villages around a radius of 50km , in spain you have only 1 . 
  so even if in france only 2 out of those 10 villages have `` saint '' it 's still a bigger number than that 1 village in spain with `` saint '' in it 's name . 
  why not ? 
  - [ olx ] ( https://olx.pt/ ) - [ custojusto ] ( http://www.custojusto.pt/ ) - [ standvirtual ] ( http://www.standvirtual.com/ ) ( cars ) - [ imovirtual ] ( http://www.imovirtual.com/ ) ( real estate ), 
  not any fish . 
  a cod fish !, 
  or like we say in portugal : `` um bacalhau , caralho ! '', 
   what is a t1 ? 
  ah right ... it 's an apartment with 1 bedroom . 
  - t0 = apartment with living room , bathroom , kitchen . 
  - t1 = t0 + 1 bedroom - tx = t0 + x bedrooms . 
  yes , it will probably be a shorter time than 52 years . 
  but then again , this is for lisbon , there are quite good cities in portugal where you could rent for half the price . 
  [ gold for you ] ( http://www.bensstudio.ca/images/tn_golden_cod03.jpg ), 
  - 400 $ per month for a t1 in lisbon . 
  - 200 $ for food - 100 $ for gasoline - 100 $ for extras - 800 $ / month = 9600 $ per year . 
  500000 / 9600 = 52 ( years ) and that 's for lisbon , there are cheaper places . 
  but of course you wo n't be living like a king , but still the sun is the same for everyone , 
  my mistake , it was n't a burka since it was n't covering the full body . 
  if i 'm not mistaken it 's called `` abaya '' ( i do n't even know about western fashion xd ), 
  i 'm in a `` students residence '' from my university with lots of erasmus students , and if it was n't the `` abaya '' most of the times i would n't distinguish between a middle east girl and a portuguese girl with tan . 
  besides we see spanish/latin american players in the portuguese league ( football ) that spent many years in portugal and yet they ca n't say a `` portuguese '' word , while some days ago i heard one of this girl speaking portuguese ( of course it was kind of rough but still ) edit : not `` burka '' but `` abaya '' . 
  ( i know nothing about `` fashion '' ... ), 
  i understood him . 
  but spain is like our argentina , we need to say bad things behind their backs ...
