original : http://www.movehub.com/blog/global-second-languages portuguese is also colored as austronesian in timor , and `` portunol '' in uruguai is simply epic . 
  around here that 's called coffee flavored tea . 
  also nothing beats a 10 bar machine when the matter is to extract caffeine from coffee beans . 
  interesting ... * apanhar um pivo * ( getting a pivo ) is a somewhat but not that much common slang for getting wasted/drunk in portuguese . 
  brasilians have dedicated webpages , and even [ books ] ( http://mlb-s2-p.mlstatic.com/livro-as-melhores-piadas-do-portugus-roberto-goldkorn-13936-mlb214248809_5848-f.jpg ) to make jokes about portugal / portuguese people , from [ text ] ( http://www.piadasnet.com/piadas-de-portugues.htm ) to [ comics ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=piadas+de+portugues+tiras&amp;es_sm=93&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aczbu-_okke47aadhygyba&amp;ved=0cb0qsaq&amp;biw=1007&amp;bih=931 ) to [ videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cigt4zhtacy ) . 
  they are known as `` piadas de portugues '' so imagine the circlejerk when portugal lost 4-0 to germany , yet karma is a bitch . 
   a quick one : - why do portuguese have moustaches ? 
  - to look like their mothers . 
  ----- - how many portuguese jokes do exist ? 
  - two , all the others are facts . 
  where ? 
  that 's cheaper than `` no brand '', 
  i know that feeling . . 
  i often use a app on my phone called `` color grab '' , to check those `` beautiful color pallet maps '' , although it 's a pain to check each country individually . 
  olive oil , sunflower oil , whale oil . . 
  that 's really interesting , because i 've never saw lidl selling frozen snails around here , although the closest lidl to me is fairly small and the frozen area is mostly ice cream , potatoes , fish fingers and some croquettes/rissole around new years eve . 
  can be [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__lyfrja0ke ) away , please note that here they 're cooked :p when they 're hard to get out of the shell ( or because you 're in a place where you need to look a little more civilized ) , may be used a fancy french [ * escargot fork * ] ( http://www.hospitalitywholesale.com.au/products/gable-snail-fork.jpg ) , or simply and more commonly a [ toothpick ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kcwz7hpmazk/tdwgfova3li/aaaaaaaakq8/ka9-qo9f190/s1600/dsc05163.jpg ) . 
  on general nevel , blood sausage/pudding should be considered * the european dish * , every country/region has is own version , and they 're almost every time delicious . 
  now [ arroz de serrabulho ] ( http://www.cm-pontedelima.pt/imagens/noticias/janeiro2010/sarrabulho_amandio.jpg ) is the one that puts me off , it 's mostly bloody rice . 
  not classy as the french version : bigger version are called : [ `` caracoletas '' ] ( http://c3.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b340431a6/13565121_zfd48.jpeg ) smaller version are called : [ `` caracois '' ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ous_g_1ub8/t6q6t7524ni/aaaaaaaad_q/p0rukqoufk0/s1600/caracois%2bportuguesa.jpg ) they 're the perfect company for a cold beer in a hot summer day . 
  also , there are dozens of other foods made of entrails or less appealing parts , but that is somewhat common all across europe . . 
  i think that only applies for people that never had worked , payed taxes in portugal . 
  i 'm not sure about that , there must be some more recent changes . 
  you should change the description of your flair to : * portugal special administrative region of the people 's republic of china *, 
  get the shitiest reality shows from uk , us , france , make them even worse , add south american style soap operas , basically you get portuguese tv . 
  thank you internet/cable tv , so i can watch some uk , us shows . 
  note : if you have/had a house , or work/worked in portugal . 
  you can not drive a car with a non-portuguese number plate . 
  the car will get apprehended . 
  yes ... , you saw all this emigrants driving back to portugal in the summer ... 
  but take note if they are caught by picky police , they 're in trouble . 
  especially if they get the fiscal police . 
  and , yes !, 
  this is just part of the law . . and yes !, 
  the law is very stupid and picky . 
  also , a legalized mk4 supra in portugal is more like 30k ~ 40k . 
  the taxes on a car like that , are huge too . 
  i always knew there is something much more french in [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/estremoz13.jpg ) . 
  ** [ artsy boobs copy alert ] **, 
   less than minimum wage sometimes they 're even held like slaves , but the eastern mafias smuggling people are a subject for an entire topic ... 
  so , he blames the environmental agency for following eu directives . 
  i 'm not saying that 's not true but saying that 's the cause of floods may be a bit overstretch . 
  and yes , the title is the classical tabloid media of today . 
  also , at least here since `` we '' started getting data and working with spain ( eu directives ) , the floods became less serious , especially because they stopped sending us surprises . 
  . . the history book on the shelf . . 
  . . it 's always repeating [ itselffff ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj_9cinkkn4 ), 
  alternative plan : # 1 make a foreigner country hijack a eu airplane for you ; [ part ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/15/guinea-bissau-minister-resigns-over-human-trafficking/ ) # 2 on arrival immediately ask for asylum , during the process receive a welfare house because you ca n't be imprisoned ( or simply pay for a hotel if you are rich ) ; # 3 even before receiving asylum , run away . 
  you are not allowed to leave the country , but the worst thing that may happen is being deported back to the country where you have a asylum process going on . 
  [ translated ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsol.sapo.pt%2finicio%2fsociedade%2finterior.aspx%3fcontent_id%3d97994&amp;act=url ) edit : there was a lot of political propaganda about refugees choosing our country , then they run away within 2 weeks . 
  a funny huge slap on political propaganda . 
  more like : [ 13 provinces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_portugal#new_provinces ) + their 18 [ districts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/districts_of_portugal ) + [ municipalities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/municipalities_of_portugal ) within your district + [ freguesias ( parish ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freguesia ) within your municipally . 
  that was what i had to learn , giving me 67 names . 
  although at least my teacher did n't enforced much the municipalities , giving on a total of around 50 names . 
  note : it can escalate quick if you consider that alone the municipally in portugal with more parishes has 89 of them . 
  but i do n't think that they have to know all 89 of them , probably just the closest ones . 
  so , we have the same font and also the same color scheme . 
  italian [ calcio storico ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yzijskqs_8#t=272 ) ( aka historic football ) , is a sport of popes take that . 
  now you have made a good point , sometimes is good to be in the corner way from the `` party '' . 
  the last revision on the continental borders was in 1926 , we still have some disputes ( a village here , two meters there ) . 
  but yes , they are pretty much the same since 1300 . 
   most countries see themselves as `` in the center '' of europe some in corners , with only one neighbor . 
  :'( edit : it 's like being in a island , by car you must cross the sea of spain then the sea of france . 
   a close friend of mine who was pretty much white-haired in his early life has very dark hair now i know someone exactly like this , and also the eyebrows . 
  every single time someone see a picture of me as a kid : `` is that really you ? 
  ca n't be !, 
  c'mon you do n't have pictures as a kid ? '', 
  [ menina est\u00e1s \u00e0 janela ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nif0oox-dpm ) it 's a very traditional song , originally from alentejo but everyone from north to south and isles , will know the lyrics . 
  it has hundreds of adaptations from just vocals to [ rock ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr7medegp_o ) . 
  bonus : [ weeding proposal with serenade ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knqboq-bbwm ), 
  c'mon galicia you are our left sock !, 
  or we are yours ? 
  :p [ portuguese sailor song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ku8nhg7aoy ) [ pauliteiros miranda ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=varmqnamyly ) * miranda 's stick dancers *, 
  exactly this . 
  on the tv shows about them getting jailed abroad , they are often portrayed as victims/heroes by crimes that in some cases would get them close to death penalty in america . 
  is n't this standard procedure , everywhere ? 
  that 's what i love about the place , and the [ pena palace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pena_national_palace ) on top of the hill surrounded by a garden with plants from every continent , shows it pretty well , 
  spain has no real eu sceptic party , but the people are more eusceptic then uk . 
  all left wing , and the far-right in portugal are anti-eu , but i do n't see them having a majority . 
  ( btw at the moment they have 10 % of the portuguese parliament ), 
  at a 15 minute drive from where i live , ** sintra ** . 
  full of palaces/castles in dense wooded hills , dozens of parks with `` exotic plants '' from `` other worlds '' , misty half of the year , there will be witches , near the sea , unesco world heritage by it 's landscape .

  with 3 oscars [ la vita \u00e8 bella ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/ ) definitely deserves a rewatch . 
  thank you , for coming up with the topic , since i do n't know many european films , especially after 2000 . 
  the list is starting to look great . 
  same here . 
  ... and portugal , spain , germany , macedonia , sweden , italy , denmark , finland and the uk and the list goes on ... 
  still have alleged secret cia prisons with little investigation . 
  i need more details , but let me warn you that it is usually illegal to camp outside specific areas , * specially * near lakes and beaches , but there are a lot of campsites near beaches and lakes all over europe , where you could book for one night or two easily . 
   our supermarkets have actually become quite cheap ( ofc . 
  compared with average wage ) your supermarkets * are * quite cheap , you do n't even need to compare it with the average wage . 
  the last time i was there , the only thing that i found to be more or less expensive in the supermarkets was fresh fruit . 
  same for finns, 
  i was trying to say that 's nothing new and is `` somewhat normal '' , it can happen . 
  some recorded dates for snow ( in lisbon ) : 1806 ; 1811 ; 1814 ; 1815 ; 1837 ; 1933 ; 1945 ; 1954 ; 1956 ; 1971 ; 2007 . 
  in some of this dates it lasted for days , but the usual is just some traces , melting in a couple of hours . 
  there are some reports in other dates like 1993 , but it instantly melted reaching the ground . 
  i would compare it with tornadoes in europe , they exist , usually weak , every now and then one stronger , people act surprised like is something new , then they forget about them again . 
  ice pellets . 
  not actually hail .
