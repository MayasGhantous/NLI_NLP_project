  not a feasible proposition . 
  you will always need water for the whole system to operate . 
  a nuclear plant schematic is n't much different from a coal or gas plant , the only thing that differs is the power source . 
   serious question , do people mistake portugal with spain that often ? 
  ` muricans, 
  money is/was always the issue . 
  god knows how many things i 've kept on hold and the ones i 've forgotten in the meantime because of money . 
  living in the poorest country in western europe does n't allow to make such plans as well . 
  i guess i 'll just wait a little bit more . 
  this comment is written with pure envy , because i 'm also 27 and never left my native country . 
  because estonia can not into nordic and finland does n't let them . 
  eu comes and makes things right . 
  for the sake of latin love i hope you 've made one for wine consumption . 
   it 's just that `` belgium '' does n't work , has n't worked in ages , and is absolutely certainly never going to get better . 
  looking from the outside i would have to disagree . 
  i remember a time , not so long ago , when we ( portugal ) were discussing the bailout , imf , austerity measures and whatnot and you ( belgium ) did not have a government , and did not have for at least a year , and still had economic growth . 
  economic growth is n't by any means the sole measure from which to know if a country works or not , but it does says something about the country as whole . 
   its just corruption in action aka `` the wedge '', 
  how 's the weather ?

  that might all be true and all ... but he has a mustache .

  i would say it already is !, 
  for several years i 've witness several tourist related events , like golf course construction and awards in the algarve , mass housing construction along the southwest and southern coast , the infamous allgarve branding , and the list goes on . 
  and i think this also happened in spain and greece . 
  the idea is simple , the northern europeans earn their hard earned money in their native countries , and when they retire , they migrate south , with much more cash than they need . 
  meanwhile , the southern europeans develop services and tourism programs and work in said jobs , and get paid far less than their northern european counterparts . 
  those who ca n't find jobs in those areas have to emigrate ( if they can money wise ) or get stuck in unemployment . 
  in the end northern european mobility is far greater than those of southern or eastern europe , in any stage of their life . 
  i just wish i had the same mobility and that it were easier to find a job anywhere within the eu ... ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ rant-ish ^ ^ ^ tone ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ post , ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ something ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ irritates ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ profoundly .

  that would mean that robots had slipped into our society undetected . 
  you have to wait for the 25th of april , and the 1st of may to end , to glimpse something related with the european elections , and even then ( !, 
  ) , the `` political debate '' will be around party 's strife and bickering and not at all on europe . 
  just another day in portugal , i guess . 
  i do n't like the `` one-per-day '' schedule , it 's going to clutter the subreddit too fast , and some users wo n't have the time to reply and read .

  ** [ for those unfamiliar with portuguese history , the 25th of april of 1974 was the date when a military coup overthrew the dictatorial regime of the estado novo . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ) it 's probably the most important date in portuguese calendar , and as such several ceremonies are held throughout the country to mark the 40th year since the revolution . 
  the following is a short account of the ceremonies .

  according to eye-witnesses , the students would be singing and then some have climbed the structure that would later collapse .

   spanish parliament rejects referendum request with 86 % of the votes . 
   catalonia vows to continue independence fight after referendum snub anyway . 
  the independence is n't going to happend legally , they need to assume that they need to act illegally or this will start to seem a farce , they already tried all the legal channels and are starting to repeat themselves . 
  telegraph [ 12 ] let me see if i understand the whole situation : * spanish parliament rejects the referendum , basically because the central government are a bunch of cunts . 
  * referendums are illegal under the spanish constitution . 
  * catalonia is legally stuck , within spain . 
  * meanwhile scotland get 's a proper referendum on becoming an independent country . 
  * if the yes in scotland wins , i believe that the eu will trigger the proper mechanisms for accession . 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong on this one ) why not have representatives at the eu level , and maybe that way have the means to hold a fully legal referendum ? 
  or is this scenario just not possible ?
