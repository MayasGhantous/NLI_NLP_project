   is n't there a danger that you 're applying your own norms to other countries/cultures ? 
  i 'm sure you realize that your own standards are not the ultimate/superior just because they 're what you 're used to . 
  it probably is , however in this situation i think you would agree with me , not leaving your 3-year-old kid , alone , at night , in a foreign country , where both parents do n't speak the language and neither do the kids , and where you and your spouse have no ties to the local population , and adding to injury you go out to party !, 
  it 's just too many dont 's , regardless of your culture . 
  i would n't imagine doing any of this if i went to norway , no matter how beautiful or safe your country may be . 
  several reasons * there is a report of blood/fluids in the house and in a car used by the mccanns . 
  * the incredible media frenzy , that does n't allow for any other version but their own . 
  * the fact that they went to a dinner party , left their three children alone , and then ** only one ** is kidnapped ? 
  i do n't know how is it in other countries , but we do n't leave our children unattended . 
  i know this is n't an awful lot , but i did n't pay much attention at the time , and only started suspecting them 2-3 days after the event . 
  this is just a personal opinion , clearly lacking a lot of the evidences and a timeline of the events that happened afterwards . 
  * ** the national guard finally started to [ receive new uniforms ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bw74xvw.jpg ) ** .

   true , thanks for the correction !, 
  it was due to linguistics , in hungarian the country 's name 's order is bissau-guinea and i thought it 's the same in english . 
  right now , i 'm not sure if i 'm correct , as / u/meidei pointed out in his [ reply . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2152vu/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_23032014/cg9prdt ) i only `` corrected '' you because of the historical ties portugal has with guinea-bissau and as such we might have some saying in how it 's written , and it 's variants . 
   i 'm already nitpicking all the news , if you visit politics.hu , which is where i source pretty much all my english-language news , well , look at that . 
  your media gathered up and put up a site where they post most of their local news in a foreign language . 
  here , that would be almost unthinkable , since there 's great animosity between news agencies/groups and each one usually runs their own agenda . 
  they are also very permeable to political influence and lobbies interest , imho . 
   people learned some african geography this week , as former socialist vp simon , now in the middle of a scandal about unreported funds in an austrian bank account , was found to hold a ** bissau-guinean ** passport , likely semi-illegally . 
  it was later reported that 9 different ** bissau-guinean ** passports were used to open bank accounts in a newly created bank back in november , but neither holds any funds or had any activity ever . 
  a well-known fraudster / `` entrepreneur '' / business partner was connected to the case , as he was likely the dealer of the passports to politicians and businessmen by using his government contacts from the african country . 
  when the guy was taken in for questioning after a few days of debate , he died on the way in the police car , after what was reported as a heart attack from natural causes , but obviously everyone is tinfoil-hatting the crap out of the story . 
  not sure if it 's some kind of miss translation , but it should be guinea-bissau passport , and not the other way around . 
  also , i 'm amazed by your work on these threads . 
  portugal and hungary are about the same size and have similar population , yet the amount of stuff going on in each country is vastly different . 
  does your country have this amount of events or is it just a case of over-active journalism ? 
  very slow week in portugal , more than usual .

  ultramar = colonial war , yes . 
  i should have translated that more carefully . 
   the lack of coverage probably means everything is ok . 
  i disagree . 
  it most likely means no one has had the trouble of doing the coverage . 
  i also disagree on martians being bad . 
  well , there 's a saying that goes : portugal is lisbon . 
  the rest is landscape/scenery . 
  if you look at any population density map , like [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:population_density_of_portugal.png ) you find out that most of the people live in lisbon metropolitan area . 
  in second place comes the porto metropolitan area . 
  so in the end , the news naturally follow where the people live . 
  even though i live around lisbon , i 've tried to give equal treatment to all regions with special focus on the silliness , because quite frankly , there 's not much going on in portugal , imho .

  good heavens !, 
  that is hilarious !, 
  i 've heard some shit where it concerns body modification , but this is extremely funny !, 
   if you can , you might want to link all the news to an english-language news site , so those who are interested in certain topics can read up on them . 
  best i can do is use google translate , since most of these news are very very very local , and there wo n't be any reference in international media . 
   also consider grouping the news by category , so those who do n't care for , say , cultural or sports news , and would only go for the international level politics/economics stuff can do that will do . 
  now i have to learn how to make that thin line like / u/meidei does between topics .
