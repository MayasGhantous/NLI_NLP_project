  ** note : ** this is the first time i 'm doing this because i noticed the lack of coverage for portugal . 
  while compiling the news , i 've decided to leave out everyday political bickering because it 's very sterile and does n't lead to anything really , and most of all the economic events like debt emission , interest rates because i do n't really understand the matter and have a tough time to translate the terms and i do n't want to mislead anyone with an improper translation . 
  if there 's any matter that you would like for me to cover next week , please suggest . 
  feedback on this list is appreciated . 
  i like british humor , but frankly that was fucking terrible !, 
  trailer voiced by [ jeremy irons ? 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460/?ref_=tt_cl_t1 ), 
  offtopic : what is the main goal of that page ? 
  oh boy , you must be from portugal . 
  argh !, 
  i know the joke , but i do n't remember who said it !, 
  damn u.s.a !, 
  your 13 % is larger than germany 's , poland 's and russia 's . 
  yes . 
  that was were my obsession begun . 
  never heard of it . 
  going to give it a try . 
   the intouchables is a french movie about a paralyzed rich man that hires a street hustler as his caretaker . 
  my favourite comedy . 
  highly recommend if you want to feel good from head to toe . 
  inspired by a real story . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wibmxkewu[1] that is probably one of the best films i 've ever seen . 
  i think i have to rewatch it . 
  quarterly sounds nice , but i think every 6 months would be better , because even though there 's a lot of good european movies and tv shows , they seem to come only every other 6 months . 
  also , example : la cage dore\u00e9 ( as i said in my comment ) was a big success last summer in portugal and france . 
  since then , i have not seen anything remotely as good . 
  if you try to do it quarterly , you 'll do two posts coinciding with the holidays ( summer and christmas/new year ) , and you probably wo n't have that many replies , imho . 
  [ goodbye lenin ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357 ) because recently i 've become obsessed with daniel br\u00fchl . 
  [ la cage dor\u00e9e ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261749/ ) french/portuguese comedy film which depicts the life of an emigrated portuguese couple in france . 
  and remember kids : it all started when portugal regained independence . 
  also , i 've never saw that gif . 
  loving the latter years . 
  ** portugal : ** * the mozambique born portuguese player eus\u00e9bio da silva ferreira died at age 71 , on sunday . 
  monday his funeral took place . 
  also , `` desenrascar '' which the best translation so far is `` to pull a macgyver '' . 
  not really , and i have no idea how much it costs .

  what could possibly be better ? 
  spaniards coming over to portugal in search of better conditions . 
  now there 's something you do n't hear everyday . 
  what do you mean `` about the eu '' ? 
  it 's current size , growth through member-states ? 
  living on the edge of the continent , the sheer size of what was the polish-lithuanian commonwealth never ceases to amaze me . 
  also the clusterfuck that was the holy roman empire is something that i still ca n't get my head around . 
  *  every house puts a candle in the window . 
  * my grandma puts up a candle for baby jesus ... by the window . 
  *  open presents on christmas eve * we open presents on the midnight of christmas eve . 
  so it 's fairly similar . 
  *  traditional dish is lye-treated codfish . 
  * we eat cooked salted codfish , but it 's seems to be the same when i searched the [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutefisk ) . 
  also we have so many ways to eat codfish . 
  *  goose blood soup * we have [ cabidela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabidela ) , which is chicken blood with rice . 
  i sense that sweden is some kind of long lost brother . 
  [ proxmate ] ( http://proxmate.dave.cx/ ), 
   however , speakers of both languages have a hard time understanding each other . 
  we portuguese understand spanish perfectly , the same ca n't be said for the other way around . 
  this is due to the fact that we 're exposed to spanish from early on whereas they are n't exposed to portuguese . 
  as an example : my nice loves a new spanish tv show , violetta . 
  she will grow up understanding perfect spanish . 
  ( just stealing your comment to join the facts ) apparently portuguese sounds like russian to untrained ear . 
  also it 's said that the language has so many sounds , that when a native portuguese speaker learns a new language he/she has little to no trouble in pronunciation . 
  well , when it 's written romanian i can understand some of it , but put me some french text in front of me , and i struggle a lot more . 
  really ? 
  are uk house prices rising ? 
  i really like to know cause i 'm applying for a graduate program for a uk based company , and it 's nice to know these things in advance ... but in the other hand there 's no jobs in my country so i guess it 's better than nothing . 
  i 'm ashamed to admit this but ... til how to check if spaghetti is done with honey boo boo . 
  when i heard mine , at the start he said * no ca n't portuguese * with a very common lisbon accent , but at the end when he spoke gibberish he seemed to trail off to the brazilian accent .
