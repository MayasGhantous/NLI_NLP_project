  i think there 's a lot of people caring about the story , namely parents whose children were taken from them . 
  it gives them some sort of comfort i guess . 
  at this point i do n't think plastering her face would have any effect , as well . 
  she 's probably in some dungeon like natascha kampusch , or the girls from the usa were , before they broke free , making maddies sighting a lot harder . 
  i think the all-time hide and seek champion is/was osama bin laden . 
  maddie still has a lot to go . 
   oh and more madeline mccain news if anyone still gives a damn . 
  this time , in greece . 
  article [ 5 ] i guess you 're fed up as much as we are , uh ? 
  nope , at least not for me . 
  seems more orderly and clean than lisbon though, 
  totally not intentional !, 
  having been bombarded by the german stereotype , most of my life , i find it funny that around 80 % is spot on . 
  somehow i feel i 'd fit right in , minus the language of course .

  we have a running municipal elections going on , and some folks put up a facebook page with the finest `` treasures '' found from north to south of portugal . 
  even though the page and posters are in portuguese , just click the photos section to browse on through .

  i 'm actually surprised that belgium and netherlands have such an high value . 
  is this only due to antwerp and roterdam ports , or is there other factor ? 
  and that , fellow europeans , is how a portuguese tells a spaniard to go suck a dick , while offending some unsuspecting whore and the shit around him , in one sentence . 
   there was a well documented earthquake 1500-something ( 1520s ? ), 
  and another a little after the conquest please there is evidence if older historical earthquakes . 
  source ? 
  if you can find it . 
  edit : [ history of lisbon wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_lisbon ) . 
  search for quake, 
  right now i found myself wondering the following : the lisbon earthquake was 250 years ago , and it 's common saying that a new one is certainly coming . 
  if that is true , should n't it also be true also a quake of the same magnitude before 1755 ? 
  yet , i never heard any report of such event . 
  what about blizzards ? 
  no chance of that happening ? 
  i know only three things about finland : [ korpiklaani - vodka ] ( http://youtu.be/e7kjrgpgvrq ) [ apocalyptica - hall of the mountain king ] ( http://youtu.be/zf2aivkp1oy ) [ lordi - hard rock hallelujah ] ( http://youtu.be/gah9nrgnhuu ), 
   i remember there was one set in the 1800 's with this girl who wanted to free the slaves and her father was super strict and horrible i do n't watch soap operas , but i believe that you 're talking about escrava isaura ( slave isaura ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escrava_isaura_ ( 1976_tv_series ), 
  i think the best way to know if they 're from brazil , is to check the producer . 
  * globo * is the biggest producer , as far as i know , so if [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/globo-network-logo-%282008%29.png ) symbol comes at the credits , then it 's a brazilian soap opera , most certainly . 
  wait , greece has brazilian soap operas ? 
  i thought only portuguese speaking countries had them . 
  to be fair , i heard that portuguese is a language with many sounds ( ca n't claim the veracity of this since i 'm no linguistic expert ) , so when the verbs and vocabulary are learnt the diction comes easily . 
  i think the sounds hardest to pick up are the * th * sound . 
  often i hear people not being able to pronounce words like * thick * and come out sounding like * tick * . 
  regarding spain , their pronunciation of the letter v and b are pretty much the same . 
  it 's sounds like * b * . 
  does n't help speaking english , i believe . 
  besides the mandatory english classes i had , i devoured tom & jerry , because they were mute most of the time . 
  after that i got curious about the other shows with english speech , started watching them as well , and began to pick-up the language . 
  because of this , about the age of 12 i found myself on the toilet thinking in english . 
  oh , and the fact that many of the modern english words have their roots in latin helps a lot . 
  i think / r/mapporn would love you . 
   an half-good half-rotten apple is still a rotten apple . 
  semantics aside , you can still take away the rotten bit of an apple and eat the rest and you wo n't die . 
  i know i have n't . 
  and i think the same goes for the eu , or any organization really , as a whole . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm going to need context here . 
  what exactly is a failed state ? 
  what are the metrics for this ? 
  you do n't need to be young to do an inter-rail . 
  you just need money , time and no commitments during said trip . 
  who knows how my life will be in 20 years ? 
  i read : grind the wheels out . 
  which is terribly time consuming and quite stupid frankly . 
  my mistake . 
  the chance of doing an inter-rail from lisbon to tokyo is so tempting . 
  now , if only i had a million euros to do it . 
  or have a train with a system like [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/u_lfiukcpnm?t=31s ) . 
  i think there 's a train that comutes between spain and france with the actual system working , but i ca n't find the video .

  sardines as starters in restaurants ? 
  maybe the canned ones , not really sure since it 's been years since i 've visited a restaurant . 
  the grilled sardines we eat are [ these ] ( http://medias.photodeck.com/b43e8860-cd74-11e0-a1a0-9d7028e4ebad/12258d4_xgaplus.jpg ) .

  i also learned that the us have/had a full colour-coded war plans , just in case . 
  all those plans seem borderline paranoid . 
  i wonder what kind of plans do the major powers in the world have right now . 
  i 'm sorry , but dom duarte pio de bragan\u00e7a , is * the * real king !, 
  a portuguese with a moustache as glorious as his , must be king !,

  as neutral as you can get in such times . 
  we `` lent '' the azores base to the usa to get their ships and planes across the atlantic , and sold tungsten ( know as wolfram at the time ) to germany and axis for the production of weaponry .

  edit : the 4th largest . 
   his engineering degree was fake , so after losing an election he went to the sorbonne to get a real one . 
  yeah , he went to study philosophy !, 
  as an engineer , this boggles my mind , as portuguese citizen it 's strikes me as just normal politician bullshit .

  the whole july and first 2 weeks of august are usually very hot and dry , with temperatures always around 30\u00ba-35\u00ba .
