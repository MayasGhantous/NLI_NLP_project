i think it was the only time i cried after a football match ... 
  we did n't beat them , we are * tied * ... 
  stereotypical ? 
  yes . 
  lazy , easy satire ? 
  definitely . 
  but i would n't call it racist . 
  it 's basically portraying how the republicans ( the elephant ) are against the recent iran nuclear deals , claiming obama is untrustworthy for allowing this . 
  it also tries to represent the republican side as warmongering and obama 's side as peacekeepers . 
  lots of symbolism in that cartoon . 
  do we really swear all that fuckin ' much ? 
  we might say `` foda-se '' and `` caralho '' a few more times , but that 's about it ... 
   oh , and people from the north swear a lot . 
  ah , go fuck yourself . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ kid ^ ^ ^ , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ kid, 
  he drinks that ginginha like his life depended on it . 
  well , some say our diet is one of the healthiest . 
  the problem comes in the more ... * meatier * dishes ... 
  written italian ? 
  yes . 
  spoken ? 
  fuck that !, 
  no , he mocked people who implied that that there were * only * honest people paying taxes , based on their anecdotal data . 
  `` the fact that many people do x does n't mean all of them do it . '', 
  this is always true , but it is also always useless . 
  just because not everyone evades taxes does n't mean that the amount of people that do is n't too high , especially for greece 's current situation . 
   based on income bracket that right there already allows for massive tax evasion . 
  how can you control how much do they work , how much they earn ? 
  that slight acidic taste when chew on a pineapple bit ... goddamm , i want a pizza right now . 
  the way this sub is currently , it took me till `` muh democracy '' to understand it was sarcasm ... 
  did not expect to see portugal that high up . 
  interesting , considering our `` nationalistic '' tendencies ... 
  if you take away the safety pin of a grenade , was the pin responsible for the ensuing explosion , the explosives within , or both of the above ? 
  so , portuguese and galician are considered the same dialect ? 
  they 're awfully similar , true , but the same ? 
  the whole political left in portugal could be considered ~ ~ popular ~ ~ populist !, 
  just look at the socialist party ( in a very close position to win the next elections ) promises : reduce cuts , increase pensions , more public spending . 
  they literally say they want to reverse the austerity . 
  shh , do n't upset the `` banks are the devil '' rhetoric ... 
  but ( most of ) those modern cash registers have loopholes implemented on purpose as a feature , to allow owners to prevent some of the orders to get logged . 
  usually requires the machine to enter in a sort of test mode and it has been a huge controversy here . 
  if manufacturers do n't implement these loopholes , they get royally fucked . 
  paying with credit or debit card is one way to prevent them doing this . 
  yup , and while it 's sort of a gimmick ( most of us do n't give a rats ass about the prize , and hardly ever check to see if won ) , it * has * been important to reduce fiscal evasion , especially because the prize came along with a platform that allows us not only to check every receipt issued with out fiscal number ( your lottery chances are based on the amount of money registered in the total of those receipts , up to a certain amount ) , it also allows us to * register * receipts that do n't appear in the system ( which is the major point ) . 
  in a way , it was a quick and dirty way to educate the public on the matter , and make them care , even if only little more . 
  i want them to stay in the eurozone . 
  i want them to improve , as i know a lot of greeks , especially young adults , are anticipating a situation worse currently than what me and mine will have . 
  but this whole bullcrap that rest of the european union are the bad guys and they are the victims needs to stop . 
  why the fuck should they get a free pass after categorically refusing to do any meaningful long-term reform ? 
   this is also interesting and in my mind comes from your government 's continued emphasis that portugal is totally different from ( and in a better situation than ) greece . 
  hardly . 
  it 's mostly that we tightened our belts , greeks not so much , even while getting a considerably greater amount of money . 
  yet , they keep crying foul . 
  you can push an engine way further than an `` arbitrary limit '' . 
  just do n't be surprised when the engine fails spectacularly . 
   were n't preceded by religious thought that religious thought itself came from basic empathy and a need to conserve society . 
  morals exist as a consequence of living in society , and that is * then * reflected on the morals by all religions . 
  hence why `` do n't murder those close to you '' is so high up on virtually all religious tenets . 
  so , yes , you can claim that modern western ethics ( including secular ethics ) were n't preceded by religious thought . 
  but it 's a useless claim , because you are implying causality , when they simple start from the same place . 
  hmm , that 's interesting . 
  and kind of makes another point . 
  can that really be considered `` poverty '' ? 
  one would presume then that a greek `` poor '' is way worse and a `` poor '' person in luxembourg , right ? 
  scientific ? 
  yes . 
  religious ? 
  that 's a bit iffy ... 
  portuguese would be depicted as a short , big moustache , thick eyebrow hick . 
  every nation has it 's stereotypes , deal with it . 
  wait , we beat luxembourg ? 
  we have a mass exodus to luxembourg !, 
  that ca n't be right ... 
  yup , the same reason why they are investing heavily in us . 
  german workers demand * less * ? 
  if that is even remotely true , that just means greeks are asking * way * too much . 
   a few dead people . 
  i. . . what ? 
  oh , yes , exactly . 
  time for greeks to start investing the money they * do n't * have to start making more money . 
  then the government can tax it from about less than half of the population that actually * does * pay taxes so they can give it to god knows how many people that decided they were too old to work . 
   and the civil war at this rate , you 'll probably get another . 
  stop flexing your muscles and acting tough and acknowledge that you should n't even have to go through a situation the term `` survival '' applies . 
  and probably against regulations . 
  the economy ? 
  perhaps . 
  assuming the country will survive the riots the dramatic decrease in standard of living will precipitate . 
  there was a vote to elect the people who after that put you in the eu . 
  just wait for the next legilatures ... we 'll be the next greece in no time . 
   i had zero say in any of this . 
  then you should 've voted when you had the chance . 
  stop living in lisbon , or learn not to be ripped-off . 
  yes , but in this particular case they do . 
  these uber drivers come from companies that already do transportation of people even without uber . 
  this is n't the `` everybody that has a car can be a driver '' uber . 
  that 's the thing , they can , but for some reason ( you know , things like not being an asshole , being less able to rip people off ) they just do n't do it ... 
  that 's exactly what is happening here , considering that a taxi license ( an `` alvar\u00e1 '' ) and the car it is registered to are being sold for 100.000 $ + . 
  most just do n't want to see that investment go to waste , and are essentially throwing a tantrum . 
  they are , this guy does n't know what he 's talking about . 
   a few they freaking assaulted an uber driver in the middle of their `` peaceful '' protest , plus another random person not related to any of it .
