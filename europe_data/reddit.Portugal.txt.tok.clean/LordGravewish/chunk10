  so , since when is using efsf to help eurozone states against the rules ? 
  did n't your country agree to it ? 
  --  to transfer money ? 
  or for the ecb to act upon individual countries woes ? 
  guaranteeing things for greece while forcing people who explicitly said no to the euro to pay for it is breaking the rules . 
  wait , so the ecb guaranteeing a low-term loan for greece that is the only way to ensure the solvency of its banking system and therefore protect the eurosystem ... is against the mandate of the ecb ? 
  you really know nothing of central banking . 
   how on earth can you say that a bank and institutions that do n't give a shot about democracy , rules and breaking of them are trustworthy ? 
  if they are-why are we bailing out greece who should n't be in it !, 
  is that trust to you ? 
  what sort of undemocratic person are you if you agree with that behaviour ? 
  a central bank is * not supposed to give a fuck about democracy * . 
  the directly elected government is literally supposed to have no say on the way the central bank runs things . 
  ** in any democracy ** . 
  read into central bank independence . 
  i can guarantee you that if your country is a first-world country , then it has an independent central bank . 
  because that is more trustworthy than giving the ( mostly uninformed ) people influence over central bank decisions - history has shown us that democratic central bank decisions only lead to chaos . 
  the only think a central bank has to do is follow its mandate - which in the case of the ecb it is to protect the stability of the eurosystem . 
  * guaranteeing a short-term loan to greece when it 's the only alternative to a complete greek banking collapse is the definition of protecting the stability of the eurosystem * and if the rules are very strict , so strict that the central bank fails the mandate , * that is less trustworthy than breaking any rules * ( and they 've been using loopholes in the rules , instead of breaking them outright ) , especially when no member state officially complained so far . 
  how hard is it to understand that ? 
  because what matters to a central bank is ** trust in the currency ** . 
  and if the rules are n't enough to maintain trust in the currency ( which is the case with the ecb ) , then the only alternative to a complete currency collapse is to bend the rules . 
  if the markets think the central bank is willing to do anything to protect the currency , they 'll be much more trusting in the currency than if they believe the central bank is a stickler for rules . 
  a central bank that refuses to bend the rules in the face of a crisis the rules were never built for , and therefore allows the currency to collapse , is a central bank that deserves no trust from the market . 
  note that i do not agree with breaking the rules as well , my point is that when compared to the alternative ( an eurosystem collapse ) , it 's hard to argue that the eu ( including non-ez states ) would have been better off had they strictly followed the rules . 
  what should have happened is that the ecb rules should n't be this limiting in the first place , but ( as with many other things ) the ez did n't have the foresight for that . 
   yet they steal money from the eu on behalf of greece !, 
  in order to save the eurosystem from collapse . 
  which is their mandate . 
  or do you think a banking collapse in greece would be good for the stability of the eurosystem ? 
  how in hell is avoiding a collapse of an ez member state not `` safeguarding the stability of the eurosystem '' ? 
  -- and please stop de-railing the discussion with references to `` where are the french fines ? '', 
  and `` why is italy in the ez ? '', 
  and other crap . 
  that has nothing to do with the efsf or the ecb . 
  ( even if i agree with you - though by now breaking the rules seems to be a member state past time , everyone seems to do it , do n't think your country would n't be fined as well ), 
  i 've discussed this with you before , but these loans are being ring-fenced by the ecb , so non-ez taxpayers are not at risk :  `` these have been tough talks , but the agreement announced this evening means an impregnable ringfence around british taxpayers ' money , which will not be at risk in any way in this emergency financing for greece . ''  [ ... ]  in the event of a default by greece , non-eurozone countries will not be liable for the bill because their contributions are being ringfenced . 
  if that were to happen , the cash would instead come from the profits made on holdings of greek bonds by the european central bank . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/16/george-osborne-backs-down-eu-efsm-bailout-fund-greece-crisis ) all 28 eu member states have unanimously agreed to this plan ( so that 's enough as far as `` democracy '' and `` rules '' is concerned ) , as the only way to get greece the $ 7bn it needs before the 20th * without breaking any rules * . 
  the money will be back in 3 months , and only ez countries are at risk . 
  if you think the ecb is lying and would n't pay in case of a greek default , you 're crazy . 
  otherwise , there 's no reason to complain unless you want to be obstructionist on purpose and * directly * cause a greek collapse by making it impossible to get the money to greece on time . 
  i do not see what your post has to do with my comment . 
  are you saying there 's a risk the ecb wo n't pay their guarantees in 3 months time if greece does n't pay ? 
  are you crazy ? 
  that would mean the end of the eu , it 's ridiculous to even consider that the ecb would let the eu collapse for a measly $ 25bn . 
   the ecb are not trustworthy and have shown that they think rules are not to be followed . 
  they have shown that the rules do not have to be followed , if it means avoiding a collapse of the banks . 
  as i explained in [ another post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dkemq/greece_confirms_banks_will_reopen_on_monday/ct6awtc ) , if it were n't for the ecb breaking the rules , greek banks would have collapsed almost half an year ago when greece stopped following the bail-out program and asked for renegotiation . 
   that is an enormous risk to have a central bank who think they do n't have to follow the will of the people and the democratic rules they have voted for . 
  umm , a central bank is n't supposed to be `` democratic '' . 
  if you think otherwise , then you know nothing about what you 're talking about . 
  specifically , they 're supposed to be independent from politics and from `` the will of the people '' , and do whatever it takes to protect the currency/banking system , no matter if the people are against it . 
  there is a reason why in most democratic countries you ca n't do referendums regarding fiscal matters or the central bank . 
   furthermore-how do you expect to build a democratic union if the leaders and the institutions and the countries ignore the rules and just change them at will . 
  like the `` no bailouts '' rule ? 
  or the `` no debt restructuring '' rule ? 
  i 'd also like to point out the whole reason for using the efsf is * exactly * to avoid breaking rules . 
  greece needs money fast , and there 's no mechanism to get them enough money on time inside the current eu framework without using the efsf . 
   why should anyone trust the eu and the ecb and the ez if they do n't care about rules ? 
  depends on which rules are broken . 
  the ecb has shown that it 's only broken rules so far under it 's `` all it takes to protect the euro '' mantra , even if they later got cold feet with greece regarding ela when the referendum was announced and it was obvious greece would officially end the second bail-out . 
  if investors and banks think the ecb will break rules ( and the ecb 's rules are very strict compared to most central banks like the fed ) * only * to protect the euro , then that 's not necessarily bad . 
  the problem is if such institutions show themselves to break rules for other less worthy interests . 
  okay , thanks  and yeah , i think the plan with using the efsf was never to get non-euro countries to contribute - it 's just because the efsf has enough money and can be quickly ( i.e. , before the 20th , when greece has loans due to the ecb - which must be paid or the ecb is * forced * to recall all ela loans ) enacted as the necessary bridging loans , while any other mechanism would take longer . 
  if this is the case , the ring-fencing makes complete sense , to remove the risk for non-euro countries . 
  leave it for the eurosceptic , sensationalist press ( especially the telegraph ) to spin it otherwise . 
  is the bridging loan using the efsf a done deal ? 
  last i heard , they were still discussing it . 
  to be fair , the ecb should n't even have been supplying greek banks with ela since the previous bailout program stopped being followed , if they had always been following their rules . 
  ela loans are n't simply free money , they require a solvent bank to give collateral ( and that 's what defines banks as being solvent - if they have collateral or not ) , and the ecb may not accept collateral that does n't have a high ( investment-grade , so bbb - or above ) credit rating ( unlike almost everything greek banks have ) , unless the country is undergoing a bailout program , and the institutions overseeing that program confirm it is being followed correctly . 
  that the ecb was supplying greek banks with ela loans for the last few months was always a ridiculous stretch of the rules , and the only reason why it was allowed is * because no ez state complained * ( even though everybody knew that it was against the rules ) : * they stretched the definition of `` being in a bailout program '' into `` currently negotiating an extension of the program '' , and started using the ela loans ceiling as a limiter , instead of the usual eligibility standards , as somewhat of a compromise in order to avoid complaints from other ez states ( which would certainly have happened if the ecb started giving greece * unlimited * loans against low-rating collateral ) . 
  * if they had been following the rules , greek bonds as collateral ( most of the collateral used by greek banks has supposedly been greek state bonds ) [ would be ineligible due to their low credit ranking ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/assets/standards/marketable/html/index.en.html ) , but as far as i remember reading they 're currently only applying a 60 % haircut ( for every 100 $ in collateral , you get 40 $ loaned ; you can see [ here ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2013/html/pr130718_annex.pdf?3f96783ce223aba713f129ad1d7a8367 ) the normal ratings they enforce when a government bond used as collateral - category i - has an investment-grade credit rating ) . 
  as can be seen , if they had followed the rules , the greek banking sector would already have collapsed a few months ago . 
  the fact that the ecb got cold feet regarding their stretching of the rules as soon as it became obvious that the bailout program was actually going to be terminated ( once all negotiation were delayed until after the referendum , after the bailout deadline ) , does not change the fact that they spent almost half an year bending the rules in greece 's advantage . 
  and even then , they never cancelled ela . 
  they could ( and if they were following the rules * should * ) have requested back from the banks all money that was loaned against ineligible collateral , which would have meant the banks ' immediate collapse . 
  in reality , they just stopped increasing the ceiling which was acting as a limiter on ela loans , which all things considered was still in greece 's advantage ( compared to what the rules state should be done ) . 
  so , i would n't put much hope on the ecj ruling . 
  assuming the ecj enforces the treaty rules ( and they probably will , as far as i know the ecj does not have enough powers to change the ecb rules directly , as those are detailed in the treaties ) , they 're probably going to rule against * both * the ecb and greece , and state the ecb should have let greece collapse much earlier ( hopefully greece will officially be in the third bail-out by then , so that ela loans may continue ) . 
  but who knows , maybe you 'll get lucky and they 'll use some weird loop-hole in the rules to justify a different action . 
  that 's also a possibility , sure . 
  though it might be easier to split into multiple states . 
  for example , portugal would never agree to joining spain into a single state ( iberia ) in a possible federation . 
  i can guarantee it to you , the size difference alone would make it impossible , and there 's no way the population would ever accept it . 
  unless you are suggesting a 2-level federal state ( where an `` iberian union '' federal state is a sub-level of the `` european union '' federal state ) so that for example portugal keeps a ton of sovereignty ( and therefore is n't overshadowed by spain ) , but that 's too much extra bureaucracy , and would just make the whole system more inefficient . 
  there is however the possibility of adding region-level ( iberia , etc ) and culture/language-level ( all states with a certain official language ) institutions ( some actually already exist ) where neighboring states discuss * their own affairs * ( but without direct influence on the federal state itself ) , and without all the bureaucracy of a complete state . 
  anyways , for these reasons , i think that the more feasible proposition ( and what makes more sense ) , even if still * highly * unlikely , would be a split into something similar to nuts2 , using current borders ( for example , small countries with < 10m population do n't need to be split , but larger ones - especially those with internal borders like spanish autonomous regions and german states - should be split ) . 
  the most important part of the article , in my opinion ( emphasis mine ) :  the european parliament has worked very hard to keep a text protecting rights and innovation . 
  despite its efforts , ** a number of loopholes or ambiguities remain ** :  * ** the guarantees on specialised services only appear in the recitals ** and not in the text itself . 
  * this leaves a large margin of appreciation to the regulating authorities * and thus a risk of a non-uniform implementation regarding the countries 1 . 
   * ** price discrimination and `` zero rating '' practices are not mentioned in the text ** and two interpretations are possible : either those practices are not covered by the regulation and it will be to member states and regulating authorities to legislate on this , or those practices are covered and not especially forbidden which would be an unacceptable violation to the neutrality principle . 
   moreover , a point raises major concerns : ** censorship through administrative blocking of websites ** , to which la quadrature du net is strongly opposed , ** is authorised in the text ** . 
  we call on meps to put an end to this judicial circumvention in the final text , as it potentially carries major infringements of freedom of speech . 
   but i do n't have a problem with the eu as it is now . 
  i thought you were anti-eu due to your flair stating `` fuck the eu '' . 
  if that 's not the case , could you explain why you have this flair ? 
  is it referencing some kind of joke ? 
  just curious , 
  thanks .
