  but yeah , the last year so much happened that it 's normal that the opinions changed quite a bit . 
  so , if google translate is correct , 32.4 % blame `` excessive government spending and an unwillingness to change society '' for the greek crisis ( the most-voted choice ) , and 73 % believe the eu will survive the crisis . 
  that 's not that terrible , i actually thought it would be worse . 
  but yeah , it 's normal that after what has happened the opinion is 60 % against the euro , especially for such a tiny country like croatia . 
  i also agree that joining the euro right now is probably the wrong choice , though i 'm not anti-euro per se , and with some changes could make it viable again ( for example , a correctly-built federation ) . 
  do they ever state what their number of interviews/statistical margin/confidence level is ? 
  i 'd be interested in knowing it , but it 's not stated on the page , and i ca n't understand croatian :( though , this does not completely contradict the `` in favour of an european federation '' question ( which i would love to see redone in a month or two , as it has changed for sure ) . 
  this is because an european federation does not dismiss * changing * the way the euro works , fixing most problems . 
  eemember that if you ask people about whether they want a `` european federation '' , people that are not against the idea will usually answer regarding their * idealized * federation , which might include a `` fixed euro '' currency that is not under control of a few states ( unlike the current euro ) , something closer to the usd . 
  edit : i just found the [ flash eurobarometer polls done in april 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_418_en.pdf ) . 
  these were special polls done only in countries that do not use the euro yet ( like croatia ) . 
  page 66 lists the national results over wanting to join the euro or not , and it can be seen that 54 % were for the introduction of the euro , while 43 % are against the euro . 
  ( 1002 interviews , so the same statistical margins as before ) in november 2014 , [ the poll is here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb82/eb82_first_en.pdf ) and it was 56 % vs 36 % , so it can be seen that the opposition rose considerably in just 4 months . 
  ( 1027 interviews , so a similar statistical margin ) the april 2015 poll was right before the main part of the current greek crisis , so it 's very likely that it 's now 60-40 in favour of keeping the kuna . 
  its possible , a lot happened in the last year , especially regarding greece . 
  do you have a link to the poll ? 
  that 's why i said `` federal-like '' , 
  the title comes directly from the article , so it 's the article author 's fault , not op 's . 
  depends a lot on the system . 
  i 'm not sure about greece , but for example , portugal uses multi-seat constituencies , where mps are elected through a closed party-list . 
  basically , [ each constituency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assembly_of_the_republic_ ( portugal \\ ) #distribution _ by_constituency ) has a different number of mps that they elect depending on population . 
  each party builds , for each constituency , a list of mps they want to elect , and give each mp a priority . 
  these lists are public , and known well in advance of the election . 
  the [ de hondt method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) is used to divide each constituency 's mandates among the multiple parties depending on election results for that constituency . 
  then , the party members at the top of each party list are given the mandates . 
  for example , if party a has the following list for a certain constituency :  john  bill  jane and they get 2 seats for that constituency , john and bill will get the mandate , while jane wo n't . 
  once they have the seat , they can not be removed from the seat . 
  mps are allowed to vote how they like , but parties have mechanisms that allow them to request a vote within party lines ( and tend to use it for any important votes , especially the governing parties ) . 
  a mp that disregards the party lines multiple times ( or a single time on a very important vote ) may be kicked from the party . 
  this does not mean they lose their seat , just that they will not be part of that party , and therefore wo n't be in that party 's list during the next elections . 
  if they want to run , they must run with a different party , or create their own . 
  yes , independents may not run - but creating a new party is a very easy process ( they just need to collect 7500 valid signatures from registered voters , but that 's very easy to do in a country with 9 million registered voters ) . 
  this approach has a ton of disadvantages ( it makes mps less accountable , and the party system much more important , as the order of mps in the party lists depend on how much they are liked by the party , and it 's hard to get elected if you 're not high on the list , especially in smaller parties - so mps tend to prioritize the party instead of their electorate ) . 
  i 'd be in favour of electoral reform into smaller electoral circles ( for example , circles of 5 mandates , instead of having circles as large as 47 mandates in larger cities ) that are closer to their constituency ( while still avoiding most issues with fptp ) , and away from closed party-lists ( [ open lists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_list ) , or something more extreme like [ stv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) or [ mmpr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixed-member_proportional_representation ) ) . 
  still , it allows plurality of opinions in the parliament ( multiple parties , not just 2 big parties ) and avoids most issues of unitary circles ( fptp ) , or a winner-takes-all system . 
  yeah , an exchange rate is n't everything . 
  but a decrease in exchange rate is usually correlated with a corresponding drop in purchasing power . 
  greece would n't have money to increase the salaries so that people keep their purchasing power . 
  it 'd be a 75 % drop , at least for a few years . 
  the only way would be through printing even more money , but that 'd just result in hyperinflation and make matters even worse . 
  oh , i misunderstood your first reply . 
  i guess we agree , then . 
  i knew about the multiple exchange rates ( though i did n't know exact numbers , so thanks for those ) , but i just went with the official one because it was already low enough to prove my point :d, 
  exactly , it 'd be even worse ... :(, 
  argentina had a 75 % devaluation over the first two years after they left the usd peg . 
  today , 14 years later ( they left the 1:1 peg at the start of 2002 ) , it 's worth 0.11 usd according to google ( so a 89 % devaluation over 14 years ) , with little reason to believe it wo n't devaluate even further in the next years . 
  there 's no reason to believe greece will have an easier time after leaving the euro , at least when it comes to exchange rates . 
  `` just wait until 3 decades pass '' might be closer to the truth ? 
   5 minutes later devaluation kicks in and the pensioner can buy 480 $ with his 500 drachmas . 
  you 're quite the optimist , there . 
  argentine pesos had 75 % devaluation between 2002 and 2004 , when it left the peg against the usd due to the 2001 crisis . 
  and why would n't printing drachmas end up in revolution ? 
  a 50 % + drop in purchasing power in a single day ( with an accompanying 60 % gdp drop over the first year ) , together with famine due to lack of food ( and too expensive imports ) , like in argentina in 2004 , is probably harder to swallow than a 25 % gdp drop over the next 5 years ... 
   also , does the 50 % of 1003 people represent 4 million ? 
  read into something called statistics . 
  because the answer is `` yes '' , as long as the 1003 people were chosen completely at random . 
  again , i 'll repeat myself ( and this is mathematics ) . 
  assuming those 1003 people were chosen completely at random ( and according to the eurobarometer report they were , they detail exactly how they chose the people for the interviews ) , with a 50 % observed result , they can represent * any * population with a margin of 5.19 % for 99.9 % confidence . 
  this means that those 1003 randomly chosen people , of which 50 % answered `` yes '' , represent ** any ** population , with a 1 in a 1000 chance of the real `` yes '' result being outside the range of 44.81 % and 55.19 % . 
  if you do not believe what i am saying , then you should either study mathematics , or/and prove it wrong and get a few nobel prizes to your name . 
  you 'd probably have to prove most of what we know in mathematics is wrong , though . 
  the difference for your anecdote , is that your circle of friends/acquaintances is the complete opposite of * random * sampling . 
  at best , all it could be used for would be to calculate an estimate of what people who know you think . 
  therefore , it 's useless , statistically . 
   also , that poll information is 1 year old too . 
  so it 's more recent than a 2 year old document ( that , by the way , never gave concrete numbers of how many people believed the eu was n't a good choice - even if only 10 % did , it would still have made sense to release such a document ) ... 
  so , a 1-year-old statistical poll from a competent organization that seems to have followed all requirements for a statistically representative poll , versus a document that never even ran such a poll ? 
  of course the first one is better . 
  [ in the annex of the 2014 eurobarometer study ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf ) it says that there were 1075 interviews for portugal . 
  that means that the `` 50 % '' statistic of portuguese people that agree with a federation has a statistical margin of 3.1 % at 95 % confidence . 
   i talk to people , i hear what they say . 
  i saw the burning of the eu flag in 2013 . 
  anectodal information is useless when you have polls that prove otherwise . 
  if you could prove that the poll should not be trusted , then maybe . 
  even then , i 'd still be suspicious of any kind of anecdotal information ( unless you have 3.6 million anecdotes - one per person in the country ) as its most likely simply a `` statistical bubble '' . 
  eurobarometer is a very reputable organization , too - part of the european commission . 
  i trust them more than any portuguese ( or croatian ) statistics organization . 
  also , that document you linked is more than 2 years old . 
  [ you 're free to check the details of the poll ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf ) . 
  according to the annex , the croatian interviews were made by an institution called hendal ( under supervision from eurobarometer ) , maybe you know of it ? 
  the interview process seems to follow all rules for such a process ( random selection , in-person , native language , etc ) . 
  in total , there were 1003 interviews in croatia between 31/04/2014 and 9/06/2014 . 
  according to the tables in the annex , `` 50 % for '' has a 3.1 % statistical margin , for a confidence of 95 % . 
  that means than there 5 in 100 chance that the real number of people in croatia who agree with the question is outside the range of 46.9 % and 53.1 % . 
  [ with some math ( well , in this case a javascript calculator ) ] ( https://www.mccallum-layton.co.uk/tools/statistic-calculators/confidence-interval-for-proportions-calculator/ ) , you can calculate the statistical margin for 99 % confidence , which is 4.07 % . 
  so there is 1 in 100 chance that the real percentage is outside 45.93 % and 54.07 % . 
  in the same vein , you can calculate the margin for 99.9 % confidence , which is 5.19 % . 
  so there is a 1 in 1000 chance that the real percentage is outside 44.81 % and 55.19 % . 
  so , unless you find something wrong with the actual interviewing process ( in terms of random selection and such ) , i hope you 're not going to argue that the science of mathematics/statistics is wrong , right ? 
  fes - federation of european states ? 
  ues - united european states ? 
  ef - european federation ? 
  hee - holy european empire ? 
  aes - awesome european states ? 
  4r - fourth reich ? 
  there are many options :p, 
   btw , can you brealfly explain to me what does the senate do a bicameral system is usually used in a federal government . 
  in a bicameral system , there are `` two parliaments '' . 
  the lower chamber corresponds to what in portugal is the `` assembleia da r\u00e9publica '' . 
  the lower chamber is supposed to be mostly proportional to the population , similar to `` 1 person , 1 vote '' ( although due to other issues you can never achieve 100 % proportionality , and some places will weigh slightly more than others ) .
