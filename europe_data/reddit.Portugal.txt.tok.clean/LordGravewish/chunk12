  for a normal state , this effectively means that larger population centers have more weight , as they end up electing more mps . 
  for example , even in portugal , a rural city will have less decision weight than the capital city of lisbon , just for the simple fact that there are more people living in lisbon and therefore more mps representing it . 
  now , while you might say that is fair , if taken to the extreme of a large country/federal state , you do not want a smaller state ( like portugal ) being `` ignored '' because larger states ( like germany ) have a much larger population . 
  but you also do n't want to make it so that a portuguese person 's vote is worth more ( as it 'd be unfair to the german people ) . 
  so what happens , for example in the us , is that you have a higher chamber ( usually called the senate ) . 
  this chamber consists of multiple representatives of each state/region in the country , where each state/region elects the * same * number of representatives , no matter their population . 
  for example , each us state elects ** two ** senators . 
  no matter if there are 10 times as many people living in state 1 versus state 2 . 
  this higher chamber usually has veto powers , and it 's main reason for existing is so that states are not `` ignored '' during the decision-making process . 
  an advantage from having two chambers , is that you can add checks & balances between them , where each chamber tries to make sure the other chamber is following the rules , so that there are now * two * chambers to corrupt instead of just one . 
  wikipedia says this regarding the us senate ( emphasis mine ) :  the framers of the constitution created a bicameral congress primarily as ** a compromise between those who felt that each state , since it was sovereign , should be equally represented , and those who felt the legislature must directly represent the people ** , as the house of commons did in the united kingdom . 
  this idea of having one chamber represent people equally , while the other gives equal representation to states regardless of population , was known as the connecticut compromise . 
  ** there was also a desire to have two houses that could act as an internal check on each other ** . 
  ** one was intended to be a `` people 's house '' directly elected by the people ** , and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents . 
  ** the other was intended to represent the states ** to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government . 
  the senate was thus not intended to represent the people of the united states equally . 
  ** the constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation . 
  ** in the current eu framework , the council takes up the role of the higher chamber ( representing the states ) , while the eu parliament takes the role of the lower chamber ( representing the people ) . 
  however , the construction of the council ( higher chamber ) is flawed in that there is a single representative per country ( so no plurality of opinion ) , representatives are n't elected directly for the job on european campaigns ( they 're the heads of the national government themselves ) , and most negotiations happen behind close doors so they are n't accountable , on top of being able to blame `` brussels '' and not themselves whenever the electorate does n't like one of their decisions . 
  it also requires qualified majority ( instead of just simple majority ) . 
  these are just a few issues that make the council end up being probably the worst of all the eu institutions when it comes to democratic legitimacy . 
  a real , correctly implemented federation , needs to get rid of the council and replace it by a democratically elected senate , with clear rules , procedures and transparency during negotiations , so that the representatives are directly accountable to the electorate . 
  -------------------  why is the usa electural system flawed i might be slightly wrong on the details about the us election system , so maybe a us redditor can correct me if i make any mistake . 
  so , the way the presidential elections in the us works , is that there is an electoral college where each state has a certain number of electoral votes for the president . 
  people vote on a state-level on their preferred president , and then electors are nominated by the state and are supposed to follow the popular vote , although the federal constitution does not specify exactly how that correspondence is made . 
  the problem is that most states have a winner-takes-all system . 
  for example , texas has 38 votes . 
  let 's imagine the popular election results are 51 % for john , 49 % for bill . 
  ** all ** 38 electors will vote for john during the electoral college . 
  this means that effectively , bill * did not get a single vote even though the percentages came so close * , 49 % of the state 's population was completely ignored . 
  the results of such a system over a long time is that smaller parties or independents have no way of winning , because they 'll never get a majority against a bigger party . 
  effectively , parties/independents are forced to join a larger party to get their voice heard , and any vote for a smaller party is basically a wasted vote . 
  this also makes it hard to change the rules , because the larger parties have nothing to lose , and its hard for other parties to get elected . 
  as far as i know , the reasons for such a system are mostly historical ( in an age without computers and internet and so on , it was hard to manage elections over such a large country as the us ) , so there 's no reason that when building a federal state `` from scratch '' , you 'd not choose a different election process that can be much more proportional and representative of different parties and political persuasions . 
  [ in the annex of the 2014 eurobarometer study ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf ) it says that there were 1075 interviews for portugal . 
  that means that the `` 50 % '' statistic of portuguese people that agree with a federation has a statistical margin of 3.1 % at 95 % confidence . 
   surrendering sovereignty . 
  this means that each country wo n't be able to make it 's own decisions as it did before ( this is probably the biggest con ) that 's not necessarily a con . 
  a democratic federal state would allow everyone to vote on a federal parliament and senate , on a federal government , etc. 
  this means that you 'd have direct control over federal policies . 
  of course , with more people involved , your vote means `` less '' . 
  but that 's not necessarily a bad thing , because states keep powers to elect their own government , and make their own decisions when it comes to local things . 
  you ca n't say that a state in the us is completely subservient to the federal government and is unable to make any decisions , right ? 
   it would probably help poorer ` states ' , but would n't be as good for the wealthier . 
  why ? 
  because in a federation it would be critical that all the state economies function well . 
  if one economy goes down , the federal government has to help it . 
  a federal government would have powers to control the smaller states if they start screwing up , for example a federal tax agency that could fight corruption in any state ( like the irs ) . 
  negotiations to help a failing state would n't be simply `` if you promise to do this , i 'll give you the money '' , depending completely on trust . 
  it 'd be `` we make you do this , and we give you money '' . 
  this means that it 's also good for wealthier states ( compared to the current situation ) because they 'd have instruments to use to enforce stability at federal level . 
   some say that people will be more distanced from politics . 
  let 's be honest , most people do n't really know what is happening in the european parliament . 
  but on the other hand , a federation could change this . 
  with much more powerful federal institutions , that would probably stop being the case . 
  you ca n't say that someone in the us does n't know anything about the federal government , right ? 
  if you give the institutions enough power , parties themselves will start campaigning for votes much strongly . 
  if you open up all the federal level decision making processes to a parliament/senate , instead of simply having the eurogroup decide things behind closed doors , you 'd make everything more accountable and give people more reason to follow the events . 
   if it is so hard to create a new party in your country , because you are n't satified with the current ones , imagine how harder it would be to do so in a massive federation . 
  there would n't be any reason why your state can not have non-federal parties , though , or independents . 
   possibly we would fall in a two-party system like in the usa ( this already happens in many countries ) . 
  maybe look at germany as an example of a federal system where there is a bigger plurality of opinion with many parties in the parliament . 
  usa 's two-party system is mainly due to their electoral system . 
  this all depends on implementation . 
  as with anything , most of the cons depend on exact implementation . 
  if done right , there is very little disadvantages of such a federation , mostly down to the loss of sovereignty . 
  i think most people just assume it would n't be done right , though . 
  ---------- [ you can read the european federalist party 's programme here ] ( http://federalistparty.eu/our-positions/our-political-programme/ ) , for more details on what a federal system * might * entail . 
  some choice quotes ( emphasis mine ) :  half of all european citizens do not believe that their voice has any impact in european elections . 
  we therefore propose ** the creation of a representative european government , headed by a democratically elected president and accountable to a bicameral european parliament ** . 
  one chamber shall represent european citizens ; the other shall represent member states . 
  ** the european parliament shall have the right to initiate legislation . 
  **  [ ... ]  the efp supports the federation of european countries with the objective to give more power to the european citizens ** according to the principle of subsidiarity and of better management ** whatever is their ethnic or cultural background . 
  in this view the ** efp supports that certain policies are better dealt with at the european level while other are better managed at the regional , national or local levels . 
  ** at the same time , the efp does not support claims that are made purely on the basis of nationalistic or ethnic principles . 
   [ ... ]  similarly , a social mobility fund could further motivate people to look for opportunities elsewhere in europe by reducing the costs of relocation . 
   finally , we support ** the development of a european labour agency ** able to bridge the gap between demand and supply of jobs across europe and facilitating better coordination between european social systems . 
  this is necessary to ** ensure the transferability of social and pension rights for citizens living and working across europe throughout their life . 
  **  [ ... ]  we therefore believe that one of the reforms that need to be implemented is ** the definition of minimum social standards ** such as minimum revenue indexed to the cost of living at local level and the commitment to ensure that decent working conditions are applied to each worker in europe . 
  ** these measures should be an integral part of europe 's social dimension . 
  **  [ ... ]  most currency unions have the ability -- through a strong national or federal budget -- to help particular regions of the monetary union facing asymmetric macroeconomic difficulties . 
  this is beneficial for everyone , because in interlinked and interdependent economies , a social or economic problem in one country can quickly become troublesome for others , just as progress in one country can boost economic growth in others . 
   indeed , ** since the profits of the internal market are shared throughout europe , the burden of economic hardship should also be shared ** . 
  we need to promote cross-community cohesion and solidarity in times of economic distress to ensure that an excessive gap in the living standards and opportunities of european citizens does not expand . 
  therefore , alongside an internal market that ensures efficiency through competition between european regions and businesses , ** a european complementary safety net should also be in place ** . 
   we would also like to see a renewed focus on those budget items that promote greater territorial and social cohesion , hence reducing disparity between people and regions across europe . 
  this is crucial to develop a competitive and inclusive european society . 
  we wish to promote ** a solidarity scheme at european level ** that works as an automatic stabiliser , such as a ** european-wide unemployment benefit scheme or an unconditional basic income guarantee scheme for each european citizen . 
  **  [ ... ]  to reach our common goals , ** europe should have its own resources while reducing the overall tax burden on each european citizen ** . 
  we wish to use a european budget to fund those policies that deliver value for our citizens , such as the creation of an integrated european energy market , support for local environmental policies , industrial policy and transport infrastructure . 
  a financial transaction tax approved by the european parliament as currently debated in the eu as well as environmental levies could also be considered . 
   [ ... ]  ** a democratically legitimate oversight of national budgets should also be put in place at the federal level ** in order to ensure that member states do not generate uncontrolled amounts of debt in the years ahead . 
   [ ... ]  the efp believes that ** the mandate of the european central bank should be extended beyond maintaining price stability ensuring that economic growth and employment are also taken into account ** , as happens in the united states . 
   [ ... ]  currently european citizens living in other member states can vote for local elections and european elections , but not for all national elections . 
  ** in a federal europe , every european citizen would have the right to vote and to stand in all elections that are held in the member state where he/she resides . 
  ** this would be in line with the principle of the free movement of citizens , and with the objective of fostering active citizenship . 
   [ ... ]  ** we consider that there can not be a true functioning democracy in europe if we do not have true european political parties . 
  ** currently the european federalist party is the only bottom-up and pan-european political party that is able to present candidates in several european countries who defend the same political programme . 
  in fact , the other entities that take part in european elections are often alliances of national parties . 
  it is therefore a matter of urgency to ** establish a simplified procedure to register pan-european political parties ** and to allow them to present candidates for european elections without having to follow all the different national legislations .
