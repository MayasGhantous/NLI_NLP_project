  it 's effective . 
  if you add an exception for struggling economies , it would be a useless rule - there 's no reason for a non-struggling economy to fake their numbers . 
  do n't oversimplify . 
  without commenting on the actual proposals on the table ( which i also disagree with ) , if most ez member states had a referendum on whether to give greece a third bail-out , they would vote overwhelmingly no ( no matter if they 're correct or not , i mean , tyranny of the majority * is * a thing ) . 
  do n't they also deserve to be heard ? 
  i mean , in the grand scheme of things , the greek population is very small compared to the ez total population , so the `` democratic option '' would be to cut them loose . 
   at least with ireland , they have the decency to keep asking until they get the right answer . 
  yeah , that 's not what happened . 
  i 'm tired of hearing people spout this as if it were the complete truth , so i 've started to reply with this comment anytime someone does so . 
  [ exit polls showed that the reasons they voted no were these  ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/post-vote-poll-1.1268589 ) :  do n't understand / not familiar 40 %  protect irish identity 20 %  do n't trust politicians/govt policies 17 %  protect neutrality 10 %  keep commissioner 10 %  protect tax system 8 % if you do n't trust a single poll , [ a * second * poll corroborates this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_245_en.pdf ) :  because i do not know enough about the treaty and would not want to vote for something i am not familiar with 22 %  to protect irish identity 12 %  to safeguard irish neutrality in security and defence matters 6 %  i do not trust our politicians 6 %  we will lose our right to have an irish commissioner in every commission 6 %  to protect our tax system 6 %  i am against the idea of a unified europe 5 %  to protest against the government 's policies 4 %  to avoid that the eu speaks with one voice on global issues 4 %  because large member states decide on eu matters 4 %  to protect the influence of small states 3 %  it would allow the introduction of european legislation in ireland , such as gay marriage , abortion , euthanasia 2 %  to avoid an influx of immigrants 1 %  the eu does not need any fixing , it works fine 1 %  other 14 %  do n't know/not applicable 3 % these polls show that the majority of people voted `` no '' because they were not informed or did n't understand it . 
  some raised important issues with the treaty , like regarding taxation and their traditional policy of neutrality , as well as their loss of a guaranteed commissioner . 
  with these polls , [ ireland renegotiated the lisbon treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-eighth_amendment_of_the_constitution_bill_2008_ ( ireland \\ ) #second _ referendum ) :  in the meeting of the european council ( the meeting of the heads of government of all twenty-seven european union member states ) in brussels on 11 -- 12 december 2008 , ** taoiseach brian cowen presented the concerns of the irish people relating to taxation policy , family , social and ethical issues , and ireland 's policy of neutrality ** . 
  ** effectively ireland 's position was renegotiated ** , and the revised package was approved by the electorate in 2009 . 
  because of the irish financial crisis it was also apparent that ireland would need increased financial support from the european union . 
   the european council agreed that :  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that nothing in the treaty of lisbon made any change of any kind to the union 's competences on taxation for any member state ;  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that the treaty of lisbon did not prejudice the security and defence policy of any member state , including ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality ;  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that neither the treaty of lisbon ( including the justice and home affairs provisions ) , nor the eu charter of fundamental rights , affected the provisions of the irish constitution in relation to the right to life , education and the family in any way ;  * in accordance with the necessary legal procedures , a decision would be taken to retain ireland 's commissioner , provided that the treaty of lisbon was ratified ;  * the high importance attached to issues including workers ' rights would be confirmed . 
  as you can see , most of the complaints were resolved ( ignoring the people who simply voted `` no '' because they did n't know what the treaty was about ) , and people who had previously voted `` no '' voted `` yes '' . 
  yeah , i do n't disagree with you . 
  a transfers union would never work as it is right now , we 'd need an actual fiscal union . 
  i 'm all for it , though . 
   well , the eu is not a federal union/state ... yeah , the thing is that an [ optimum currency area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) needs relatively large transfers , the eu 's are n't enough for a stable currency . 
   what is the us federal budget / us gdp ? 
  [ around 20 % , it seems . 
  ] ( http://www.supportingevidence.com/government/fed_budget_as_percent_gdp_over_time.html ), 
   p.s. 
  : we a similar mechanism to shift money around through the eu budget . 
  some countries are net-contributors , others are net-receivers . 
  yeah , but the eu budget is less than 1 % of the gdp of the eu 's economy , it 's insignificant compared to the us transfers through federal taxes . 
  i did n't say it would be used for any reason . 
  but i can see it be used if an uncooperative greece breaks treaties and refuses to let go of the membership rights without fulfilling their side . 
  possibly even using their rights to bring the eu institutions to a stand-still in order to `` get revenge '' , by vetoing everything in the council and ecb board for example . 
  my point is , if greece 's main card in the negotiations is that they ca n't be expelled and wo n't leave voluntarily , that does n't help their side much . 
  to be fair , assuming a honest and co-operative government and a decent plan ( which includes debt restructuring ) , a default could be unnecessary , since the same result can be achieved through internal devaluation ( competitivity increase due to lower salaries , taxes , and other costs of doing business ) , without the huge political and economical instability typical of a devaluating currency and hyperinflation . 
  problem is , we have neither a `` co-operative government '' , a `` decent plan '' or `` debt restructuring '' , so yes , that 's probably the only way forward for greece . 
   the greek state has been running a positive balance for years , minus the intrest payments . 
  false . 
  they had two quarters with an official primary surplus , and even then , it 's debatable , multiple publications are n't all that sure if it was n't just creative accounting . 
  yeah , but they 're currently undergoing austerity due to a high debt and deficit . 
  i 'm not really sure a grexit will aid anti-eu parties , at least not more than a non-grexit . 
  for example , if greece implements the drachma and starts devaluation , they 'll have some very bad years until the situation starts to stabilize . 
  voters in other countries that are undergoing austerity will probably notice this and vote accordingly ( for example , podemos will lose votes ) . 
  on the other hand , if the creditors give in to greece , there is the risk that the opposite happens , and portugal , spain , ireland and italy all elect syriza-like parties and request the same conditions . 
  as for richer countries like france or germany , i can see many voters voting for anti-eu parties exactly because they do n't want to give more money to greece ( as polls have shown , the popular opinion in those countries is overwhelmingly against giving more money to greece ) . 
  all in all , i really think the worst case in terms of anti-eu sentiment , at least in the short term , will probably be if the creditors give in to greece . 
  yeah , it might not be used , but i could see it being used to suspend some rights in the case of a completely uncooperative greece breaking treaties left-and-right but still wanting to maintain their powers , for example in the eurozone institutions after officially switching to drachma . 
  as for it only being a `` suspension '' , the thing is that it does n't impose time-limits , so there 's no reason why there could n't be a `` permanent suspension '' , which is * de facto * the same thing as an expulsion . 
  assuming unanimity in the council ( other than greece ) , article 7 teu allows for sanctioning a member state that is in serious breach of the treaties . 
  these sanctions can include a suspension of any and all membership rights of that country in the eu , * including voting rights * . 
  unanimity , other than the offending country , is required to declare a breach of the treaties , while qualified majority is required to decide on sanctions . 
  this means that while there is no way to expell a country from the eu , it is possible to have a * de facto * expulsion , where the country is no longer a member of the eu in all but name . 
  isolated like that , such a country would then be under a ton of pressure to `` voluntarily '' leave the eu and renegotiate its diplomatic position from the outside . 
  of course , this requires unanimous support ( including greece 's friend cyprus ) and therefore would probably require a * very very * serious breach of the treaties ( that could negatively affect the whole eu ) to be used . 
  but a defaulting greece that is no longer using the euro ( and possibly in breach of more treaties ) but wanting nevertheless to retain its ecb powers might be enough to get the remaining member states to unilaterally suspend all greece 's eurozone rights , while leaving other eu rights alone , for example . 
  thanks for the reply , it makes your position clearer . 
  it seems to me they are discussing a humanitarian package on the chance that there is no deal , and therefore there 'll be a grexit . 
  if so , it 's the first option you mentioned , which i see nothing wrong with ( except for the grexit itself , but that 's a different matter entirely ) , and it seems we agree . 
  not saying the grexit is unavoidable ( and it 's a real shame if it gets that far ) , but assuming that to be the case , would you prefer no humanitarian aid ? 
  serious question . 
  i 'm personally not against it in principle , just against the grexit itself . 
  humanitarian aid may mean injecting money into greece while bypassing the greek government . 
  so , effectively , letting the greek government ( and people ) feel the consequences of refusing the deal ( including a switch to drachma ) , while making sure there 's not mass starvation , lack of meds , etc. 
  i do n't believe for any moment `` humanitarian aid '' means a disguised bail-out . 
  it 'd be a scandal in the whole eu ( whose popular opinion is overwhelmingly against ceding to greece ) , if the institutions did something like that in order to bypass the parliaments . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trying to imply that i was playing this off as a joke ? 
  i was n't . 
  i agree , i keep hearing people say the greeks `` do n't have much left to lose '' , but i think they 're being * way * too optimistic there . 
  if a grexit really happens , we 'll have a humanitarian crisis on the ground in greece . 
  i seriously hope it does n't come to that . 
  i agree . 
  this tweet just appeared in the guardian 's live feed , and it matches my thoughts exactly :  [ juncker , tusk and the other creditors did n't get the memo about greece 's stronger negotiating position post-referendum . 
  then i 'm definitely not `` reading too much into it '' ... 
  it 's interesting that the summit on sunday will have all 28 members present , not just the eurozone . 
  it might be reading too much into it , but this may mean they 're ready to start discussing possibilities which would involve the whole eu , like what happens if there 's no agreement . 
  [ seems it will be a summit with * all * european leaders , not just the eurogroup ] ( https://twitter.com/fgoria/status/618517018669617152 ) . 
  it might be reading too much into it , but if it were just to discuss a greek bail-out , the non-eurozone leaders would n't be needed ... are they going to start discussing what 'll happen if no deal is reached in the following days , perhaps ? 
  portugal : `` greece greek want money '' ... checks out, 
  the cbg is subordinate to the ecb , and has to follow their rules , or leave the euro . 
  the ecb charter says this :  the european central bank and the national central banks together constitute the eurosystem , the central banking system of the euro area . 
  ** the main objective of the eurosystem is to maintain price stability : safeguarding the value of the euro . 
  **  the european central bank is responsible for the prudential supervision of credit institutions located in the euro area and participating non-euro area member states , within the single supervisory mechanism , which also comprises the national competent authorities . 
  ** it thereby contributes to the safety and soundness of the banking system and the stability of the financial system within the eu and each participating member state . 
  ** it could be argued that such a bail-in to protect the banks without protecting the government is exactly `` safeguarding the value of the euro '' and `` contributing to [ ... ] the stability of the financial system of [ ... ] each participating member state '' , while still being a-political . 
  a central bank that is not allowed to solve a liquidity problem is an ineffective central bank . 
  it 's a perfect solution , and would allow everyone to save face ( the creditors , because they 're not giving extra money to the greek government ; the greek government , because they 're keeping the euro and do n't have to agree to an official austerity program ) . 
  on top of that , it 's not a horrible precedent to set - i.e. , if a state over-borrows and refuses the creditor 's conditions , it may default without destabilizing the currency ( and so still pays for the consequences ) and keeping the irrevocability of the euro . 
  the `` only '' obstacle really is the greek government , but it 's not that bad for them , so who knows . 
  i could see something like this being possible : greek banks get bailed-in , a chunk of any deposits over $ 100k is used to save the banks , and they 're merged into one single `` good '' bank , plus a `` bad bank '' ( the normal bail-in procedure currently ) . 
  if the deposits above $ 100k are n't enough for the bail-in ( there 's been a huge capital flight over the last few months , so it 's not that unlikely ) , the ecb could supply the remaining amount . 
  the ecb starts officially supporting this greek bank with any liquidity assistance it might need , with the string attached that the bank must be completely independent from the greek government , and none of that money may be used by the bank to finance the greek government or any public institution . 
  then , with the bank 's stability guaranteed , the government is left to default while staying in the euro , effectively ending `` austerity by bail-out '' . 
  yes , i know that a government default would mean more `` forced '' austerity than any bail-out deal could possibly demand , but i do n't see any other alternative where greece keeps the euro without breaking treaties . 
  there 's just not enough popular support in creditor nations for anything else . 
  it requires the greek government 's support , and i 'm not sure if they 'd agree , but it 's a way for them to keep their promises of re-opening the banks and keeping the euro as sole official currency , as well as not having to agree to further bail-outs . 
  if you allow for some margin of `` breaking the treaty '' , parallel liquidity could be issued by the government on top of this ( as long as banks are prohibited from accepting the ious ) to allow for some devaluation . 
  otherwise , drastic cuts would have to be made to hit a primary surplus , but it 's more than possible ( and the greek government would be free to do it however they like ) .
