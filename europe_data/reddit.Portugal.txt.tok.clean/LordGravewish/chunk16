  i doubt you 'll find a single member state in the eu outside of portugal , spain , and ireland ( and maybe italy ? ), 
  whose popular opinion is in favour of sending greece even more money . 
  look into all the eastern european countries with a lower quality of life index than greece , for example . 
  since treaty change requires unanimous votes ( as well as referendums in some member states ) , do n't count on something like that happening . 
  the ecj part is technically possible ( though doubtful ) , but treaty changes to allow a country to stay in the eu while infringing the treaties will never happen . 
   german speaking here . 
  85 % [ 1 ] of the people are for the current stance in negotiations from our government . 
  and this is what for the greek government does n't seem to understand . 
  even if germany were the only country still refusing debt restructuring , the german government has ** absolutely no mandate ** to do so , and they 're just helping make it worse . 
  [ the last polls on the 16th of june report a slight lead of the current governing coalition over ps ] ( http://www.legislativas2015.pt/2015/06/19/sondagem-univ-catolica-junho-2015-coligacao-passa-ps/ ) . 
  ( psd/cds are the current governing coalition ) the current situation with ps reminds me of one article in the satirical portuguese newspaper `` inimigo p\u00fablico '' [ lit . 
  `` public enemy '' , a publication similar to `` the onion '' ] :  #ant\u00f3nio costa has supported syriza in the past , then was against syriza , and now is again a syriza supporter . 
   [ ant\u00f3nio costa is the current leader of the main opposition party - the socialist party ( centre-left ) , ps . 
  ps is the only opposition party that stands a chance of winning in the september/october parliamentary elections ]  every day , costa changes his opinion more times than a 14 year old girl does her clothes . 
  6 months ago , costa celebrated syriza 's victory . 
  3 months ago , costa back-tracked and stated how syriza was a dangerous extremist party , and now costa supports syriza again . 
   the problem for the ps is that the portuguese people are as volatile as costa . 
  6 months ago the country celebrated costa 's victory [ he got elected as a leader of ps at the party primaries 6 months ago ] , 3 months ago the country suspected that maybe costa was actually a * flop * , and now the country is certain that costa is a * flop * . 
  costa will keep changing his opinion of syriza , but the country will no longer change its opinion of costa . 
  ( i translated a few more articles from the latest issue of this newspaper [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c157e/cover_of_this_weeks_issue_of_inimigo_p%c3%bablico_a/ ) , if you 're interested ), 
   portugal the only opposition party with any chance to win is the socialist party . 
  they were the main culprits of the spending binge that brought us into the crisis , and their current leader has been a huge syriza supporter . 
  in the last few weeks ps ( the socialist party ) fell very behind on the polls as people realized syriza was going to fail , so if the ez does n't give in to greece , there 's no way he 's going to win . 
  also , i assume that a grexit will mean a huge drop in support for podemos in spain , since their plan is very very similar to syriza . 
  this of course assumes that the grexit does n't improve greece 's situation until the spanish elections , especially if the situation is made much worse . 
  tl ; dr : a grexit will show everyone exactly how bad ( or how good ) exiting the euro can be , and voters will take it into account . 
  withdraw more money . 
  there have been reports that greek banks wo n't survive more than a few days without help from the ecb . 
  nobody knows how true those reports are ( or if so , exactly how many days are left ) , and if such help will come , especially after a `` no '' vote . 
  if you do n't want to risk having no money and not being able to withdraw money , take it with you . 
   well the irish voted no to the lisbon treaty , not because they do n't want to be part of europe , but it was obvious it was a centrilisation of power and unelected bureaucrats trying to enforce their rules on a country or city they know or care nothing about . 
  but ireland was told `` you got the wrong answer '' . 
  try again . 
  another election later after all of europes bought off leaders chastised them , seemingly ireland changed their mind . 
  bullshit conspiracy theory , and i 'm tired of hearing people spout it as if it were the complete truth , so here goes : [ exit polls showed that the reasons they voted no were completely different than what you say ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/post-vote-poll-1.1268589 ) :  do n't understand / not familiar 40 %  protect irish identity 20 %  do n't trust politicians/govt policies 17 %  protect neutrality 10 %  keep commissioner 10 %  protect tax system 8 % if you do n't trust a single poll , [ a * second * poll corroborates this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_245_en.pdf ) :  because i do not know enough about the treaty and would not want to vote for something i am not familiar with 22 %  to protect irish identity 12 %  to safeguard irish neutrality in security and defence matters 6 %  i do not trust our politicians 6 %  we will lose our right to have an irish commissioner in every commission 6 %  to protect our tax system 6 %  i am against the idea of a unified europe 5 %  to protest against the government 's policies 4 %  to avoid that the eu speaks with one voice on global issues 4 %  because large member states decide on eu matters 4 %  to protect the influence of small states 3 %  it would allow the introduction of european legislation in ireland , such as gay marriage , abortion , euthanasia 2 %  to avoid an influx of immigrants 1 %  the eu does not need any fixing , it works fine 1 %  other 14 %  do n't know/not applicable 3 % these polls show that the majority of people voted `` no '' because they were not informed or did n't understand it . 
  some raised important issues with the treaty , like regarding taxation and their traditional policy of neutrality , as well as their loss of a guaranteed commissioner . 
  with these polls , [ ireland renegotiated the lisbon treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-eighth_amendment_of_the_constitution_bill_2008_ ( ireland \\ ) #second _ referendum ) :  in the meeting of the european council ( the meeting of the heads of government of all twenty-seven european union member states ) in brussels on 11 -- 12 december 2008 , ** taoiseach brian cowen presented the concerns of the irish people relating to taxation policy , family , social and ethical issues , and ireland 's policy of neutrality ** . 
  ** effectively ireland 's position was renegotiated ** , and the revised package was approved by the electorate in 2009 . 
  because of the irish financial crisis it was also apparent that ireland would need increased financial support from the european union . 
   the european council agreed that :  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that nothing in the treaty of lisbon made any change of any kind to the union 's competences on taxation for any member state ;  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that the treaty of lisbon did not prejudice the security and defence policy of any member state , including ireland 's traditional policy of neutrality ;  * the necessary legal guarantees would be given that neither the treaty of lisbon ( including the justice and home affairs provisions ) , nor the eu charter of fundamental rights , affected the provisions of the irish constitution in relation to the right to life , education and the family in any way ;  * in accordance with the necessary legal procedures , a decision would be taken to retain ireland 's commissioner , provided that the treaty of lisbon was ratified ;  * the high importance attached to issues including workers ' rights would be confirmed . 
  as you can see , most of the complaints were resolved ( ignoring the people who simply voted `` no '' because they did n't know what the treaty was about ) , and people who had previously voted `` no '' voted `` yes '' . 
  hmm , you 're right . 
  i had n't though of the `` tie '' possibility . 
  that makes it even more likely greece is completely screwed , because without forming a stable government , there 's no way they 'll be coming to a deal . 
   what ?!, 
  sign a document dooming his country ? 
  you said so yourself that even the last ` compromising '' document did have salvation on it . 
  did you wanted for him to sell out like his predecessors until greece has sunk completely ? 
  he is on of the few politicians that did precisely what he claimed will do so far . 
  have n't seen anyone like him for as long as i remember . 
  and i hate the guy ! . 
  i wanted him to declare a referendum on the 21st if he could n't come to a deal to his liking by then , while such a referendum would have still been on time for an extension to the bailout . 
  i wanted him to remain relatively neutral in the face of the referendum , instead of threatening to quit if the result is ` yes ' , while campaigning for the ` no ' . 
  i wanted him to have an unambiguous referendum `` this is the current deal . 
  do you want to keep the euro at all cost and accept this deal , or only if they give in to our demands ? '' . 
  not the current farce of a referendum where nobody really knows what the possible answers mean ( since it asks the electorate if they agree with a deal that no longer exists ) . 
  i wanted him to give an advance warning to the other party in the negotiations if he was going to do a referendum . 
  i wanted his parliament to avoid ratifying the report that declared the debt to be illegal and stated it should n't have been paid , because if you 're negotiating with little leverage , anything like that just makes the other side trust you even less . 
  stuff like this , just reeks of incompetence or bad faith . 
   yeah , now compare that to eu leadership demanding a different government in a sovereign country i agree that many of them would prefer if they were leading with a different government ( for multiple reasons , their electorate would probably also be more willing to commit to debt relief under another party ) . 
  but as far as i know , the elections in greece are still fair . 
   trying to imply the referendum itself is about the euro ( when it isnt ) but the problem is that they 're not lying !, 
  a `` no '' vote is banking on the creditors folding to the demands of the greek government at the last moment . 
  if they do n't ( and many signs point towards this ) , then greece will have * no choice * except to leave the ez . 
  the banks are already completely insolvent , if the ecb does n't unlock ela , greece will have to inject money into them - and since they have no euros , it 'll have to be drachma . 
   cutting the lifeline to thousands of poor people when it could easily extend it for political pressure first things first , the ecb froze that life-line 's upper limit . 
  ** it was not cut ** , just that the banks could n't request more than $ 89bn in elas , and it turns out they already have . 
  also , if the ecb had been following the rules , the ela would have been cut * months ago * . 
  they cut it once they realized the default was actually coming . 
   trying to bury the imf report i agree with this , this should n't have happened . 
   and supporting a copy-cat of the russian oligarchy for my government . 
  could you give me more information ? 
  do n't know what you 're referring to . 
   the `` pro-eu '' media are using doctored or outright fake photos with fake commentary , fake news stories , terror , suppression of the dissident ( either cutting them off or sometime even physical force in live broadcast ) . 
  i think that 's awful . 
  i hate that it has come to this . 
  if there is to be a referendum , coverage should be neutral . 
  this is completely ridiculous . 
  i also find it ridiculous how , at least in international press , many of the articles on the pro-greek side are also spun quite strongly . 
  for example , the guardian taking juncker 's speech completely out of context , making it seem like the whole speech was simply stating how the greek were bad and how he felt betrayed , when if you read the actual text of the speech 90 % of it was a non-emotional retelling of the events from his point-of-view . 
  i no longer trust press - to believe anything i need to either go to the source , or read multiple accounts to figure out the `` average '' . 
  it 's very sad , press is very important but it 's usually dominated by a few oligarchs :(  this is n't just a reddit argument , this is happening now . 
  i 'm not saying otherwise . 
  but even if you say `` people are suffering '' , that is a purely emotional argument that helps no-one . 
  i have discussed what i think will be the various possibilities after the referendum 's outcome at the start of this comment thread , and what i believe to be one of the few solutions . 
  i can understand your anger , and i 'm angry that it ever came to this , but especially as i 'm an outsider ( for now , though if greece leaves , portugal is the next probable victim , unless a fiscal union goes forward ) i 've been trying to keep a cool head , read every side , and figure out where to go from here . 
  i know what i 'd vote if the same happened in portugal , but that does n't mean i disagree with the opposite choice in principle . 
  my choice is mostly a weighed risk calculation , i think a certain vote gives a slightly larger chance for a good ending . 
  of course , if i were actually voting , it would be much harder to look at this from a purely `` probabilistic '' point of view , so i digress . 
  ----- anyways , i 'm going to go sleep for now , already too late . 
  good luck to you , no matter what happens . 
  i 'm still somewhat hopeful this whole thing works out , but i 'm becoming increasingly cynical , sadly :(, 
  i keep repeating this , but i will say it again : it does n't matter if you think politicians should be putting the fate of europe before their own party 's fate - they wo n't do it , because they like their job , and they were elected under a mandate that does not allow them to , * it would be undemocratic * . 
  that they will give more money when public opinion is against that . 
  you 're looking at the current problem as ez vs greece , where greece has problems and ez is refusing to help . 
  it does n't help anything to discuss what could have been done ( `` even though it would have been impossible '' ) . 
  what helps is to discuss the * actual alternatives * that were * politically feasible * . 
  and let me repeat : ** debt relief is not politically feasible in most of the creditor countries ** . 
  not only germany , but also for example eastern european countries with lower gdp and quality of life than * current-day * greece . 
  the public opinion in those countries is so ridiculously anti-debt-relief , if such a debt relief passed * they * would start voting for extremist anti-eu parties .
