  funnily enough , it even aired on ukraine national tv !, 
  there was a huge investment these elections by the euparl , ebu and other european news broadcasters like euronews to have multiple presidential debates ( to try and legitimize the candidates ) , but the debates were mostly ignored by many countries , like the uk . 
  most of these debates were offered to european tv channels , but other than the one on the 15th may by the ebu , many channels chose * not to air them * because `` they did n't interest their viewers '' or some crap like that . 
  they were all live-streamed online for free , though , and discussed in this sub-reddit . 
  looking at that infographic , can you guess why in germany public opinion was mostly on juncker 's ( and the spitzenkandidaten 's ) side ? 
  i 'll give you a hint - there were two german-language debates financed by and aired on german tv , on top of the rest of the debates . 
   as to the democratic deficit , it would be hypocritical if you were happy for things to stay the same , but most british people do n't want to see it stay the same , they want reform to go in the other direction . 
  thing is , that 's what most were campaigning for in the other thread - let 's let the council keep choosing unelected bureaucrats , because * democracy * . 
  also , with this new system , the ecr or/and the efdd could put forward a candidate and if he 's elected democratically by the ep ( it 's possible such a candidate could gather plenty of support eu-wide during eu elections ) , then that would be a clear democratic mandate to dismantle the current system of the eu back towards a less politically integrated system . 
  you can not say the same of the previous system , though . 
  from this you can easily conclude which is the more democratic system . 
  note that i 'm not saying the new system is perfect - far from that , actually . 
  but it 's improving !, 
  my position is not `` fuck britain '' . 
  i do n't want the uk to leave europe . 
  though , i 'm actually kind of grateful for cameron , he 's managed to solidify the ep 's support behind juncker by acting as he did . 
  i find that it 's awfully hypocritical of euroceptics ( or as i prefer to call them , eurocynics ) to denounce the eu as undemocratic with unelected bureaucrats everywhere , and then argue that everything was perfect all along , let 's have the council choose an unelected bureaucrat nobody 's heard of because it 's `` more democratic '' than having the meps that were elected in pan-european democratic elections choose the candidate with most seats supporting him out of those who ran for elections ( as happens in most parliamentary democracies in the world ) . 
  this power should belong to the parliament if we want to guarantee any sort of eu-wide democracy , that 's the reason the parliament was created in the first place !, 
  even if you say that only 8 % being able to name him is low , it 's infinitely higher than whatever unelected bureaucrat would have been named otherwise ( look at barroso . 
  how many people knew his name before elections ? 
  eurocynics are campaigning for more like him !, 
  ) , and hopefully next elections that percentage will be much higher once media all over europe actually do their job and inform the viewers , like was done in germany and few other countries . 
  hell , a 1h30-long debate between the spitzenkandidaten was aired live on prime time on rtp1 ( the state-run tv channel in portugal ) during the election campaign ( one week before the elections ) with live portuguese dubbing , as it was in many other european countries . 
  well , seeing as the ep has veto power over any treaty change , turning back the clock so that the commission gets the sole choice of candidate again may be quite difficult , unless they want to have a real power struggle with the ep ( for example next elections ) . 
  does n't germany redraw voting districts on a regular basis , to keep the population in them more or less constant ? 
  it 's the reason why a few people support dividing the eu into smaller sub-states with similar population number ( something similar to nuts2 ) , in order to achieve full proportionality for the lower house . 
  because fully proportional euparl without changing anything else would mean that germany and france would have even greater influence on the eu as a whole . 
  of course . 
  when europhiles talk about an european federation , they do n't want the status quo of backroom deals by the council/commission . 
  they 're usually thinking of a real democratically elected parliamentary system with federal government elections ( representative democracy , through meps ) to represent the european populace and some kind of senate ( similar to the council ) which would represent the states individually . 
  i 'd be 100 % against an `` unelected federal government '' . 
  the current system of undemocratic , shady council/commission deals is n't far from that , but fortunately the lisbon treaty helped quite a bit by giving a ton more powers to the euparl ( as can be seen by juncker 's election ) and we seem to be moving away from that . 
  so according to you barroso is democratically legitimate since he was chosen by elected national leaders ( mostly the uk , since they vetoed verhofstadt , the candidate every other country wanted , forcing a consensus around barroso ) , when nobody in the eu had even heard of the man 's name before he was appointed . 
  from which dictionary are you getting your definition for `` democratic legitimacy '' ? 
  infinitely more people knew about juncker running than barroso ( literal division by zero ) . 
   i said those `` far-right '' opposing federalization and more eu ; elected in a landslide did not have a voice today . 
  not that they were elected undemocratic . 
  elected in a landslide !? 
  if we count the ecr , efdd and * all * ni on the euparl ( and many ni are n't eurosceptic ) , you get about 24 % . 
  every other party has stated they are in favour of juncker . 
  76 % of seats !, 
  til that parliamentary minority parties must have veto power over the choice of prime minister in order for it to be democratic . 
  also , that `` landslide '' was only about 25 % in both the uk and france . 
  but please remember that the eu is made out of * 28 different countries * and all of them can elect meps . 
  only two countries elected this many eurosceptic meps ( about half of those 25 % are eurosceptic meps from the uk and france ) . 
  the eu elections elected pro-eu meps in a landslide almost everywhere else !, 
  even in portugal , greece and spain for gods sake - the countries who have most reason to complain about loss of sovereignty . 
  do you think juncker has more democratic legitimacy than barroso ? 
  i think that 's the point / u/ssshane was trying to get across with his second sentence . 
  even if only 8 % of voters knew who he was before the election , that is still infinitely more democratic legitimacy than the ones who knew barroso wanted the commission presidency before the election ( since literally no voters knew he was even interested in the spot ) . 
  funnily enough , verhofstadt was supposed to have been nominated , but the uk vetoed him and forced everyone else to nominate barroso instead . 
  hopefully , next elections , when politicians realize that they could actually help elect someone to the commission while campaigning for the eu parliament , we 'll increase that 8 % to a much higher value . 
   that clearly gives the choice of candidates to the council ** taking into account the elections to the european parliament ** . 
  slightly fixed that for you . 
  while i agree that the proposal of the candidate is on the side of the council , choosing a candidate supported by a grand coalition in the parliament ( juncker is supported by epp , s&d and alde who total 479 meps or 63 % . 
  the greens and the left have also said that they support juncker 's candidacy , so you have 581 meps or 76 % of the whole euparl ) is the obvious choice if you want to `` take into account the elections '' . 
  any other candidate would actually * disregard * the elections , as the parties against him are only the ecr and the efdd , who only have about 118 meps in total ( 15 % ) . 
  the remaining meps that do n't belong to any party and are probably against juncker , but together with the ecr and efdd they account for less than one quarter of the total . 
  also , the treaty gives to the parliament the power to * elect * the proposal of the council ( like most parliamentary systems ) . 
  this means that the parliament is allowed to refuse any candidate it wants to , as long as it can muster a blocking majority ( which the grand coalition is ) . 
  it also does n't state that the eu council has to go along with the parliament if it blocks a candidate , it can keep proposing different candidates . 
  but if the parliament manages to gather a blocking majority for a specific candidate , i 'd argue that the reason is that the council did n't `` take into account the elections to the european parliament '' correctly - if it had done so , a blocking majority would never have been formed . 
  also , last but not least , the parliament depends on the council 's choice either way . 
  the eu council voted ** 26 to 2 ** in favor of juncker , voluntarily . 
  nowhere in the treaty does it state the council has to do so unanimously . 
  no one is grabbing powers that are nowhere in the treaties . 
  this is just the treaties playing themselves out , with a much more democratic end-result than previously ( or do you argue that the meps we elect during the eu elections have no democratic legitimacy ? 
  they 're the ones choosing the eu commission president ) . 
   it was the very clear intention of the treaty writers that the member states remain in the driving of choosing the president . 
  source ? 
  have you personally talked with the treaty writers from each member state ? 
  did they * all * want the council to have the main role in choosing the president ? 
  ** all ** of them ? 
  this passage seems to have been left ambiguous on purpose , actually , so it 's more than likely many did n't . 
  anyways , what matters is what is in the treaty , and nowhere does it state that the council has more power over that choice . 
  it only states that the council * proposes * a candidate after weighing in the euparl elections , which they did ( juncker comes from the winner of the euparl elections , and supported by a grand coalition between the epp , s&d and alde ) . 
  the parliament then * elects * that proposal . 
   the eu treaties on the other hand , says that the european council should be the main decision making body in choosing the president of the council . 
  you meant `` the president of the commission '' , right ? 
  if so , you are wrong . 
  nowhere in the treaties does it state which is `` the main decision making body '' when it comes to the president of the commission 's election . 
  see [ article 17 of the lisbon treaty ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-3-provisions-on-the-institutions/86-article-17.html ) :  7 \\ . 
  taking into account the elections to the european parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations , the european council , acting by a qualified majority , shall ** propose ** to the european parliament a candidate for president of the commission . 
  this candidate shall be ** elected ** by the european parliament by a majority of its component members . 
  if he does not obtain the required majority , the european council , acting by a qualified majority , shall within one month propose a new candidate who shall be elected by the european parliament following the same procedure . 
  the treaties are pretty much neutral on that matter ( probably on purpose ) . 
  i 'd actually argue that `` to elect '' is a stronger verb than `` to propose '' and as such the power is mainly on the parliament 's side , but this is all semantics so i digress . 
  the eurosceptics are complaining that the council choosing the commission president is actually democratic , but i 've never ever seen them call barroso a democratically chosen commission president when he was chosen unanimously by the council without any input from the euparl . 
  actually i 've read many calling him an undemocratic bureaucrat . 
  which way is it , then ? 
   i started browsing this subreddit in the run up to those elections a couple months ago , i never heard the guy being talked about , not a word . 
  how many times did you browse this subreddit before the election exactly ? 
  i distinctly remember this subreddit being filled with posts discussing the spitzencandidaten , including discussions over the presidential debates he was a part of , all with a ton of comments . 
  hell , i participated in most of those debate discussion threads . 
  if you do n't believe me , do a search for `` juncker '' ( and `` schulz '' , `` verhofstadt '' , `` keller '' , `` tsipras '' ) , `` spitzencandidaten '' or `` debate '' and look at the hundreds of posts you find before the elections . 
  the problem was that most of the politicians , national broadcasters and media in general decided to boycott this election . 
  here in portugal , few places talked about them . 
  even then , most of my friends knew about the choice as we actually know how to read party manifestos and inform ourselves , and all main parties announced ( though quietly ) which candidate they supported . 
  hopefully , now that the precedent is set , next time politicians will actually campaign for the commission candidates with hopes of getting something out of it and we 'll get a much stronger parliamentary system as a result . 
  it 's much more democratic than backroom deals between the various member states , which has in the past many times ended up with the uk vetoing someone ( see verhofstadt , he was vetoed by the uk and barroso was nominated instead ) .
