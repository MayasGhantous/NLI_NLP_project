  `` big if '' , the ecb stopping ela ? 
  on the 20th of july greece has to pay back $ 3.5 bn of ecb loans , if they do n't then the ecb * has * to stop ela . 
  there 's no `` if '' there . 
  the rules are already stretched paper-thin , and there 's no room to stretch them further . 
  meanwhile , the ela ceiling has already been reached , and i do n't see the ecb voting to increase it further if there is n't a very credible deal on the tables , especially after a `` no '' vote . 
  but they 're not prioritized . 
  they 're fast exactly because they 're very close to the user 's network , and have dedicated peering contracts with the isps . 
  that is not prioritization . 
  prioritization means that if an important packet comes in to one of the isps routers , it gets immediately processed and relayed even though there might be a ton of packets queued . 
  it could also mean that other packets are delayed on purpose .

  [ this article ] ( https://edri.org/blurry-ambiguous-net-neutrality-deal-is-an-abdication-of-responsibility/ ) ( it was posted almost a day ago , but immediately down-voted and never reached the front page ) goes into detail of what exactly the current rules are , and why they 're flawed . 
  i thought it would be worth posting this here , since this is the `` main '' thread where the agreed-upon net neutrality rules are being discussed ( all others are being heavily down-voted , for some reason ) . 
  some people here seem to be hailing these rules as some sort of victory for network neutrality , when that 's very far from the truth . 
  let me quote the most important parts of the article :  what is the point of agreeing to adopt legislation that makes the legal situation less clear than it was before ? 
  now we have text which could mean almost anything -- we did not need more legal uncertainty . 
   [ ... ]  key points of confusion :  * ** distinction between `` specialised services '' and the public internet . 
  ** the `` fast lane '' services can only get this status if this is `` necessary '' . 
  however , the current draft explanatory recital defines `` necessary '' so broadly that anything that is not a `` general prioritisation '' of traffic could , in principle , be covered . 
  ( recital 11 , article 3.5 )  * the ** scope of the regulation ** is defined in a way that does not fully cover the key issue of `` specialised services '' . 
  ( article 1 )  * not alone does the regulation seek to define what a ** `` legal obligation '' for blocking/filtering ** might be ( does this really need to be explained ? 
  ) , the definition is so badly drafted that it could cover activities that are not legal obligations -- `` measures giving effect to such union or national legislation , in compliance with union law , including [ i.e. 
  not limited to ] with orders by courts or public authorities vested with relevant powers ; '' ( article 3.3 . a ) . 
  the current draft recital contains a 90-word sentence that has no obvious meaning . 
   * even though a draft recital explains that ** `` specialised services '' ** are only possible if they do not have a `` negative impact of the provision of such services on the availability or quality of internet access services '' , there is an obligation for internet access providers to provide details of the `` impact on the same end-user 's internet access services '' . 
  what is the agreement -- that they can have an impact or they ca n't ? 
  ( recital 11a and article 4.3 . c )  [ ... ]  the eu institutions need to decide if they are really prepared to create such legal uncertainty for european citizens and business . 
  this will become clear in the coming weeks . 
   strong net neutrality rules they should probably look at the dictionary definition of `` strong '' - it does not mean what they think it means . 
  most important part of the article :  what is the point of agreeing to adopt legislation that makes the legal situation less clear than it was before ? 
  now we have text which could mean almost anything -- we did not need more legal uncertainty eu institutions need to decide if they are really prepared to create such legal uncertainty for european citizens and businesses . 
  hopefully , the netherlands succeeds in blocking the agreement , or the euparl comes to its senses . 
  also , i wonder what is going on - all posts containing analysis of the agreed-upon net neutrality deal seem to be down-voted and never reach the front page . 
  i 've posted another article myself ( from lqdn ) analyzing this text , and the exact same thing happened . 
  the only ones that reached the front page were when we still were n't sure exactly what had been agreed ( only that the euparl had given concessions ) . 
  it 's a shame , because it would be worthwhile to discuss the flaws of these net neutrality rules with the sub at large . 
  youtube and netflix can afford to pay up . 
  it 's an unfair advantage by definition . 
  as for the no monopolies , the problem is that isps , as they get bigger and bigger ( competition disappears/merges ) have been making moves slowly towards no net neutrality , especially in the us where they have already used such tactics to extort money from netflix . 
  we are talking of an industry that requires a ton of infrastructure invesment . 
  starting a new company is n't as simple as setting up a few offices and selling your service to customers . 
  in a way , it 's similar to other infrastructure stuff like electricity , water and gas - and those are usually regulated to hell and back exactly because they 're natural monopolies . 
   startups can very well compete by buyimg the capacity they need like everyone else the capacity that they 're already paying for in their peering agreements ? 
  and you do n't see how individual isps ( i.e. , the ones the consumers use , not the ones the companies use ) demanding more than that is by definition * extortion * ? 
   this has nothing to do with monopolies it has * everything * to do with monopolies ( or cartels ) , as they 're the obvious conclusions without net neutrality in a free market . 
  the isps do not have any reason not to extort more money from both users and services , so what tends to happen is they all do it . 
  this is an industry with a huge startup cost - new isps do not show up every day , they require a huge investment ( including in infrastructure ) , so if you increase the startup investment even more by such entrenched advantages of the pre-existing companies , you 're going to get monopolies ( or competing companies doing the exact same crap ) . 
  thinking the isp market `` self-regulates '' without any net neutrality regulation is absolutely delusional . 
  it 's the exact opposite , not having net neutrality is allowing the establishment of monopolies and results in less choice and poorer service for consumers . 
  monopolies reduce necessary investment as they do not need to compete . 
  there 's no way a start-up can compete with an established company if the established company is given competitive advantages like prioritized traffic . 
  imagine a youtube that is prioritized everywhere , or does n't count towards your monthly bandwidth usage ( they have some sort of deal with the isps ) . 
  now , a competitive like dailymotion can not compete , and the user experience drops in quality considerably as their packets are not being prioritized - they 're effectively being degraded ( as prioritization of certain packets means degradation of all remaining packets ) , or/and users are being incentivized to use youtube instead so that they do n't use too much bandwidth . 
  additionally , if you allow the isp to prioritize its own iptv and voip packets , there 's no reason for it to upgrade the lines to support the remaining traffic the client is * already * paying for - since the client has no recourse , and ca n't exactly complain that `` his internet speed is much lower when the tv is turned on '' . 
  investment into network infrastructure basically stops . 
  in a completely non - `` network neutral '' world , an isp could even start double-dipping , charging for `` fast access '' ( = normal speed , if you do n't have `` fast access '' then your traffic is degraded ) to a certain set of websites twice , - once for the user ( `` buy the ` twitch ' package now !, 
  you get guaranteed access to ` high ' quality streams ! '' ), 
  and a second time for the website company ( `` if you do n't pay us , we wo n't offer a ` twitch ' package at all . 
  your competitor streaming services have already paid , though , so you better pay as well . '' ) . 
  granted , the agreed-upon net neutrality text does not allow this , but this is an example of how far the market could go without any regulation . 
  re-read the text - `` services with specific quality requirements '' are * always * allowed to be prioritized . 
  which means that if a isp decides a certain service has `` specific quality requirements '' as defined by the law ( so any iptv or voip service is included ) , it does n't need to worry about those exceptions . 
  this means that for example the isp is allowed to discard network neutrality entirely in order to cram iptv and voip over a bad connection and you as an user have no recourse , instead of being forced to actually * update * that connection to modern standards . 
  [ also , it seems the words `` network neutrality '' have completely disappeared from the text , which is even more worrying . 
  ] ( https://www.laquadrature.net/en/net-neutrality-trialogue-betrayed-european-parliaments-vote ), 
  this is the first actual analysis of the text . 
   [ ... ] the very positive text on net neutrality adopted by the european parliament in april 2014 ** has become more ambiguous and weaker ** . 
  net neutrality deserves more guarantees and la quadrature du net is regretting a third-rate agreement .
