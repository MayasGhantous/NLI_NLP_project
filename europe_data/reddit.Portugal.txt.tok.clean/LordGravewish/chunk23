   [ ... ]  indeed , ** the definition of net neutrality has disappeared ** , even though the text begins by recalling the necessity of an open and non discriminatory internet and an equal process of all internet traffic . 
  likewise , ** provisions on specialised services are very blurred and equivocal ** and may be used by operators and large online services to circumvent net neutrality and harm consumers ' freedom of choice as well as competition and innovation . 
  this is bad , very bad . 
  the council managed to lobby the euparl into capitulating to big companies on this issue . 
   therefore it is important to have future proof rules which , while fully safeguarding the open internet , allow market operators to provide services with specific quality requirements in order to provide them in safe manner . 
  it is not a question of fast lanes and slow lanes - as paid prioritisation is not allowed , but of making sure that all needs are served , that all opportunities can be seized and that no one is forced to pay for a service that is not needed . 
  they allow prioritization for `` services with specific quality requirements '' , for which iptv and voip would qualify . 
  prioritization is effectively the same as degradation of the remaining traffic . 
  my point still applies . 
  it 's still not enough . 
  the parliament 's suggestion was ideal , but the council had to water it down and screw everyone over . 
  that 's sad . 
  also , the netherlands is actually going to * lose * some of their net neutrality rights , which is also bad . 
  let 's hope they block the bill until net neutrality is fixed . 
  i doubt it - once the telecoms law passes , it wo n't be revisited for a * long long * time . 
  traffic prioritization only makes sense if you have a very bad connection to a customer , and want to make sure the user gets iptv or voip without noticing the bad connection , no matter if their internet is slow as hell . 
  well , guess what - that 's a way for your isp to screw you over , wash its hands of the problem , * when in reality it should make sure the infrastructure is up to modern standards and does n't require prioritization at all * . 
  and guess what - you now have no legal recourse if this happens . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  cdns have * nothing * to do with network neutrality . 
  cdns are `` fast '' but they are not prioritized at isp-level . 
  the reason they are fast is because you distribute your static content ( images , css , etc ) over many servers all over the world , and these servers have more outgoing bandwidth capacity ( bigger links ) , as well as are optimized to deliver static content very quickly ( lots of caching , ram , etc ) . 
  the main server might be much farther away from the client ( so inherently slower ) , and only needs to worry about dynamic content ( which is usually much smaller in size ) . 
  but once the traffic leaves the server 's or cdn 's outgoing link , ** it is always treated alike ** . 
  net neutrality means your isp can not prioritize certain traffic above others - the current rules allow it to prioritize `` important traffic '' , and that means it 's not network neutral . 
  now , maybe the definition for `` important traffic '' is n't bad , but imagine the consequences of maybe declaring `` youtube '' or `` skype '' specifically to be important traffic and for it to be faster or cheaper ( not count towards your monthly bandwidth ) . 
  now , any competitor has a huge hurdle to jump , and most likely will be unable to compete . 
  anyways , traffic prioritization only makes sense if you have a very bad connection to a customer , and want to make sure the user gets iptv or voip without noticing the bad connection no matter if their internet connection is slow as hell . 
  well , guess what - that 's a way for your isp to screw you over , wash its hands of the problem , * when in reality it should make sure the connection is up to modern standards and does n't require prioritization at all * . 
  i did n't mean to imply you had written it - i was just pointing out their wording is simply wrong . 
   why are the new net neutrality rules the strongest in the world ? 
  are n't the net neutrality rules in the us actually stronger ? 
  `` disappoint '' is the understatement of the year . 
  anything short of full-blown net neutrality is bad , very bad . 
  our tech companies will suffer for it . 
  damn the council . 
  they kept insisting and insisting , and held up roaming charges as a bargaining chip - they did n't want to pass them unless the parliament agreed to crippling net neutrality . 
  and damn the euparl for giving in . 
  in the end , they probably think that the roaming charges are worth it , because a `` normal citizen '' will notice them more than net neutrality , at least in the short term . 
  it 's very sad that the eu wo n't get full-blown guaranteed network neutrality . 
  i personally think it would have been worth it to sacrifice the roaming charges bad instead , if it meant we got full net neutrality everywhere in the eu . 
  a bad deal , in the end , net neutrality is more important than a roaming charges ban , and we get the second but not the first :  the sides decided that sequestering will be acceptable , as long as it does n't affect `` general '' quality of internet access this is so vague there basically is n't any guarantee of net neutrality in europe , and that 's very very bad . 
  i 'd be interested in reading the actual text - i 'm worried whether the council succeeded in removing all references to the term `` network neutrality '' , as was proposed before . 
  screw the council . 
  two can play at that game :  it 's like if i made a poll that says `` do you want to receive 1000 $ from steve ? '', 
  and then i go to steve and say that he has to give each and every one of the people who voted 1000 $ , or else he 's being undemocratic as a majority voted ` yes ' . 
  but lets forget these stupid comparisons as they over-simplify the problem and can be spun both ways , so they 're just a waste of time . 
  a poll where the `` no '' is being campaigned as being the choice you should pick if you want a better deal , that 's ridiculous . 
  a `` better '' deal would never pass in the creditor countries ' parliaments , especially the member states with a lower quality of life than current-day greece . 
  if you think a `` no '' will give greece a better deal , you 're delusional . 
  and many will then blame the ez and call them `` undemocratic '' and `` not accepting the will of the greek people '' if `` no '' wins and the creditors do not offer a better deal ( as they have said multiple times they wo n't ) . 
  i do n't mind the referendum itself - i think it 's a great idea ( though should probably have been scheduled a few days earlier , so that there would still be time to pay the imf ) . 
  it 's just sad to see it being spun as `` yes to current deal '' , or `` no , a better deal '' , when it 's obvious that 's not what it 's going to be ( and everyone but the greek government agree ) . 
  a fair , neutral referendum should be a `` yes to current deal ( austerity ) '' or `` no , we default ( new drachma , devaluation ) '' question , * that * would be democratic for both greece and the creditor nations , as the greek people would know exactly what they were voting for , instead of being mislead into delusions that the creditors would be bound into giving them much better conditions if `` no '' wins . 
   collaterized loan though the collateral are greek state bonds , which are worthless ( according to all rating agencies ) and all ecb rules already state those are not valid collateral outside of a bailout program . 
  the only reason they were still being accepted was because the board of governors was disobeying the rules completely under the justification that a deal was going to be reached `` soon '' , and no member state complained as everyone knew it was the only reason greek banks still had n't collapsed , and were hopeful for a deal . 
  so i can see why he considers the loans to be `` free money '' . 
  from what i know , the plan has always been to pay on time - the `` ultimatum '' was probably exactly that , if they did n't have a deal in 48h , they 'd be going into arrears . 
  from what we 've heard from both sides , that 'd make sense . 
   this for the very near future that 'd be great . 
  but it actually means a short-term * much worse * than this . 
  as in , `` no money to import food and so food prices skyrocket and * everyone * except the rich starves '' - worse . 
  i think they 've already realized that it 's impossible for greece not to go into arrears with the imf , so any new deal would consist of paying the imf after tuesday and hoping nobody cares . 
  either that , or they have found a way around the rules to get the money to greece fast , and are just waiting for an agreement . 
  if there is a deal , it would take time to be able to give the money to greece to pay the imf debt . 
  the ecb board of governors would have to vote on whether to give the central bank profits from greek debt back ( which could take a day ) , and any further payments would have to go through all ez national parliaments . 
  that 's probably the reason for the 48 ( instead of 96 ) hours - as afterwards greece would probably never get the money on time for the imf payment . 
  the problem is , the council has nothing to lose . 
  the average person knows nothing about what happens in the council , many do n't even know the council exists ( or that it is different from the commission or the parliament ) , as such the council can do whatever they want , while national governments blame `` the eu '' . 
  during the national elections nobody cares about what their government did in the council - any punishment by the electorate is given during the following euparl elections instead , even though the euparl usually stand up against such pushes by the council . 
  the `` democratic deficit '' in the eu is mostly caused by this fact , and i 've always found it funny how eu-sceptics who keep using the `` democratic deficit '' argument always want to give the council more power . 
  same , the english part of the press conference is n't at all disagreeable . 
  the english part of the conference does n't seem that disagreeable . 
  i 'd still be interested in reading the rest of the conference ( where he supposedly says that he feels `` betrayed '' and such , and i 'd like to check the context ) , sadly no translations as of yet . 
  [ the juncker press conference is actually worth reading . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_speech-15-5274_en.htm ) the guardian article makes it seem like he spent most of his time expressing how betrayed he felt . 
  most of the conference , however , was spent explaining what proposal was on the tables and all the effort/negotiation that went into it . 
  yes , it 's about setting the precedent . 
  and it turns out greece does not have the economic strength to force the precedent * they * want . 
  it is n't inherently bad , except when your purchasing power effectively drops over half in a single day , after switching currencies like that . 
  the uk is n't in the eurozone . 
  ah , okay , thanks . 
  that 's good , 
   we can not therefore conclude that the fault lies solely with greece i agree . 
  this mess does not have a single `` cause '' . 
  reality is never simple like that . 
  `` right '' ? 
  sorry , but tone is n't conveyed very well through text , so i 'm really not sure if you 're agreeing with me , or that 's supposed to be sarcasm . 
  care to explain ? 
  i 'm not saying it wo n't work , but that it will require them officially exiting the eurozone , as they are not allowed to use a second currency while inside , as far as i know . 
   25 % of gdp primary budget surplus is that a typo ? 
  because such a number is impossible . 
  a 25 % surplus is miraculous . 
  [ for example , forbes reported a primary deficit in february . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/16/greece-still-has-a-vast-problem-it-doesnt-have-a-primary-budget-surplus/ ), 
  sure , but ecb has to cut off ela access to greece once greece defaults on ecb debt , $ 3.5 bn of which is due on the 20th of july . 
  and that would * technically * be a default , as far as i know . 
  even then , the rules are already stretched so thin , that it 's very likely that even if ela is n't cut-off , they will stop increasing the limits due to the fact that greece broke the negotiations unilaterally ( all previous increases were passed on the grounds that a deal would very likely be imminent ) , which will result in the same situation . 
  anyways , my point was that if such a cut-off happens , greece is never going to be able to stay in the euro . 
  not whether such a cut-off will happen or not .
