  i mean , it would n't change anything , as you say . 
  why do you lock your doors ? 
  people will pick the lock anyways , not like it changes anything . 
  why do you use encryption ? 
  they get your metadata anyways , so not like it changes much . 
  yeah , that 's a ridiculous argument . 
  it 's better than having my servers somewhere where they are * allowed * to spy on you and your servers , where the server provider has to , by law , allow them to install a black-box inside their network . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  even if they spy on everything , let 's not make it easier for them , okay ? 
  it 's harder to spy on everyone when you have to bend the laws to do so , and less likelihood they 'll put the effort for someone unimportant like me . 
  if mass surveillance is illegal , companies have incentive * not * to allow the intelligence agencies to do whatever they want on-site , as if they 're caught they could be liable . 
  and theoretically , intelligence agencies * themselves * are liable , too , even if i doubt much would happen in the event of a scandal . 
  i 'm paying a company for service and expect not to be spied on with their knowledge . 
  if they do not guarantee that , i 'll pick a different company that does . 
  if a lot of people do the same , it might even be an interesting case study on what happens to a country 's it sector when orwellian laws are passed . 
  so while there are countries that do not allow mass surveillance , i 'd prefer to have my server located there , and pay them instead , thank you very much . 
  also , it makes me feel good that the vat on my monthly fee is n't going to a state with mass surveillance laws , but that 's just me . 
  [ a score of 51 and front page for / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34yl7b/french_national_assembly_approves_mass/ ) is not wanting to mention this ? 
  it 's got over 6 times as much score as this post ... 
  yeah , i 'm not going to switch * right now * . 
  but it 's becoming increasingly more likely i will end up switching in the future . 
  hopefully ovh goes through with their threat if the law actually passes , and moves somewhere else . 
  i 've had nothing but good service from them , so i have no reason to switch to a different provider other than this law . 
  if you are french , please consider [ contacting your representatives ] ( http://sous-surveillance.fr/ ) about this issue . 
  can anyone in france more acquainted with this issue than me tell me if it is at all likely that this law will not come into being ? 
  is there enough support for sending it to the constitutional court ( or however it 's called in france ) ? 
  it seems the time to move my ovh server from france to another eu country is coming closer and closer ... 
  i never actually expected france to be one of the first eu countries to pass actual mass surveillance laws . 
  i 'm disappointed :(, 
  i do n't really know any good summary of it . 
  my knowledge comes from reading a ton of articles on the subject . 
  it seems the final report of the parliamentary inquiry on the bes bankruptcy has been finalized . 
  you can access it [ here ] ( http://www3.parlamento.pt/sites/com/xiileg/cpibes/paginas/relatoriosactividade.aspx ) . 
  it goes through everything that happened ( specifically , the `` apuramento dos factos '' section goes through literally everything related to the bes bankruptcy ) , but i would n't consider it a summary . 
  for someone who is n't a native speaker , it might be quite a complex read . 
  i do n't know any other source that sums everything up , sorry . 
  i 'll see if i can find something . 
  i 'm busy right now , so i 'll try to answer the remaining questions tomorrow . 
   quite good people most of the angolans that invest in portugal have their hands down the regime 's pie . 
  we 're talking about a country whose average person has less than 2 $ per day , yet they have about half our gdp !, 
  angola has one of the most corrupt regimes in the world , and yet we 're all buddy-buddy with them . 
  do n't assume i think only angolan money invested here comes from suspicious sources . 
  they 're just the ones that own a ton of stuff here , and keep buying more . 
  also , our government loves bending over to their diplomatic and economic bullying ( the whole besa negotiations were ridiculous ) . 
  in a few years , it might just be that i 'll be talking about the chinese instead . 
  this is one of those topics that gets me quite angry , and the way you posted the question ( a single sentence ) seemed you were calling out something i said , so my answer was somewhat defensive . 
  it 's somewhat common to find people online calling others racist and stuff for daring to speak against the angolan government ( they assume if i 'm calling out the angolan government , i must be against the angolan people too , or something similarly ridiculous ) , so ... 
  sorry for assuming the worst . 
  anyways , i 'm not the biggest expert on the topic , but if you have more concrete questions , feel free to ask . 
  the topic makes me somewhat angry so i 've been trying to avoid it . 
  especially since every time i read more about it , it seems to be even worse than i thought before . 
  i 'm not sure what the point of that question is . 
  i 'm not blaming angola for all of our problems , nor am i blaming the angolan elite for the bes bankruptcy . 
  although , they did have a hand in that last one , through besa , and those missing 3 billion $ caused most of the 3.6 billion $ losses in the last few weeks before the bankruptcy . 
  granted , bes would have gone bankrupt either way , even without those losses , due to all the corruption they had been doing for years - rio forte being the best example . 
  it 's still money that the portuguese taxpayer will have to fork over in the future , most likely ( since novo banco will most likely not be sold for enough to cover even half of that ) . 
  3 billion $ is quite a considerable sum of money . 
  in fact , bes is one of the likely reasons in my mind why the bank of portugal lobbied so hard for the supervisory equivalence of the angolan bank supervision . 
  this way , besa profits could be counted as bes profits , and therefore could be used to cover up rio forte 's losses and delay the bankruptcy . 
  it ended up backfiring on them , though , but it worked as a delaying tactic . 
  the bop probably did n't do this to cover the bankruptcy , they probably were n't even aware , but everybody knew that the espirito santo family had quite the number of connections inside the bop , so it would be quite a coincidence if the bop lobbying for the supervisory equivalence at the same time rio forte started having problems ( though not public knowledge at the time ) had nothing to do with bes . 
  [ also , i just double-checked , and it seems to actually have been 5.7 billion $ !, 
  ] ( http://www.dn.pt/especiais/interior.aspx?content_id=3960216&amp;especial=revistas%20de%20imprensa&amp;seccao=tv%20e%20media ) not just 3 billion $ ( 5.7 bn $ is around to 5 bn $ nowadays ) . 
  controlinvest owns tons of media brands ( a full list [ here ] ( http://www.globalmediagroup.pt/marcas/media/ ) ) and is now called [ global media group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_media_group ) anyways , even the newspapers and such that are * not * owned at all by angolans would rarely think of criticising the angolan elite . 
  our `` friends '' have their fingers deep into some important people 's pockets , so anyone writing such stories would probably get fired during their next `` restructuring '' , if not sooner . 
  sorry , i meant `` some '' , and forgot ` in-part ' :d i 'm going to make sure anyways , and get back to you , i guess . 
  i was ranting and i might have gotten it wrong . 
  they partially own so much stuff in portugal and i believed at least a few newspapers were included in that . 
  meanwhile , [ bes basically lost over 5 billion $ in angola ] ( http://www.dn.pt/especiais/interior.aspx?content_id=3960216&amp;especial=revistas%20de%20imprensa&amp;seccao=tv%20e%20media ) , and nobody knows exactly where that money went as there seem to be no records of that , `` accidentally '' . 
  well , it 's not that it 's hard to guess where it went ... 
  loaned off-record to the angolan government and the angolan elite , most of it ending up being spent in portugal to buy our companies . 
  i mean , isabela dos santos ( the angolan president 's daughter ) is an amazing entrepreneur , and one of the richest people in the world . 
  i 'm sure she built it all by herself , it 's not like angolans live on average with less than 2 $ a day and she seems to be the only success story there . 
  it 's got ta be a coincidence that the single angolan success story is the president 's daughter , right !? 
  but the portuguese government are cowards , and seem to be subservient to our angolan `` friends '' . 
  anytime any of our `` friends '' seems to be a suspect of any investigation , the angolan newspapers start declaring our institutions to be racists , pro-colonialists or anti-angolan , and how this investigation is an attack on their sovereignity . 
  alternatively ( if not both at once ) , they just publicly air our government 's dirty laundry . 
  suspiciously , a few days later , charges are dropped . 
  hell , even our own government seems to undergo more judicial scrutiny than any of our `` friends '' ... and our journalists would * never * write something critical of the angolan government . 
  i mean , there 's so much dirty laundry there to air , but that 'd actually require you to do some journalism ... 
  some of the portuguese newspapers are actually owned in part by the angolan elite !, 
  it 's understandable that we as a country ca n't stand up to angola by ourselves , especially when we so desperately need the money . 
  but since when does it make sense to lobby the ecb to give european-wide supervisory equivalence to the angolan banking supervisors !? 
  the ecb did n't want to , at first , but somehow we convinced them . 
  and then we still wonder how it is possible for those 5 billion $ to have been loaned without any sorts of records of what it was used for , without anybody knowing . 
  at least when bes went bankrupt , the ecb was smart enough to take away angola 's supervisory equivalence ... and they probably wo n't be trusting the bank of portugal again in similar matters for a while . 
  i do n't know what anybody was expecting when they decided to trust the angolan supervisory system . 
  they way they seem to supervise their banks is to ask them to participate in money laundry and to give the government 's top people some money under the table ... our government should stand up to the corrupt angolan government and their cronies , and petition the eu to stand with us ( since it 'd be in their interest , too ) . 
  but that would require for them to have some balls and actually put the well-being of the country first , instead of their own pockets , and therefore not cave immediately to all the angolan economical threats and bullying that happens every other month . 
  it 's completely ridiculous . 
  the thing is that lobbying will happen even if it 's illegal . 
  money is powerful , so it 'll always try to influence politics . 
  if lobbying is illegal , it 'll be done through the back door , and no-one will know to what extent it is happening . 
  it 'll probably even make the problem worse - it 's illegal , so if you 're doing it anyway , why not go all in ? 
  the idea of lobbying being legal is that there can be very clear rules and regulations on how it can be done , donations are kept track of , maximum ceilings are applied , etc. 
  this means that it 's controlled and known by everyone , including the public . 
  not saying the current rules in the eu are good enough ( they are n't ) , but that 's the main idea , at least . 
  you can see the eu 's transparency register [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homepage.do ) . 
  it 's a complex problem , the solution is n't simply `` make it illegal '' . 
  kind of similar to drug criminalization ,
