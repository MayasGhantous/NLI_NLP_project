  they stayed at a hostel on iskra street . 
  during the first saturday , 9th of april , some students decided to go out at night . 
  during that night , a man called one of the 18 year old boys `` trash '' , and pulled on his clothes and hair . 
   the teenagers were scared . 
  the professor responsible for the exchange programme , stanislaw augustine , denounced the case to the police . 
  the suspect , identified by the authorities , is a military man , 38-years old , with 11 years of experience in the armed forces having also served in afghanistan . 
   some of the students have darker skin and were confused as being muslim migrants , confirmed the police speaker , adam szelag . 
  the public safety police collected evidence of the verbal offense and violation of the victim 's physical integrity , and submitted the case to the military police . 
   according to the rzeszow news portal , stanislaw augustine said that this was n't the only incident to involve those 15 students . 
  while some were taking a walk around town , they heard insults in english and polish . 
  there were even some people who raised their hands and showed their middle finger . 
  this also happened in buses , stores , and the town 's market plaza . 
   `` as a pole , i 'm ashamed that citizens of other countries are direct targets of racist commentary '' , commented the professor . 
  `` polish students went to portugal and were received warmly , thoughtfully , gently , not to say friendly . 
  portuguese students come here and these things happen . '', 
   the case was reported to the portuguese consulate in poland . 
  the company that organized the trip was also informed . 
  attempts were made by p\u00dablico to contact the consulate , the portuguese secretary of state of the communities jos\u00e9 lu\u00eds carneiro , and the person responsible for the company , but were unable to reach any of them . 
   the possibility was considered for the students to return immediately to portugal . 
  stanislaw augustine found an alternative : he rented a house in the outskirts of town and hired the services of a security company to protect them . 
  `` they fear for their own safety . 
  i had no other choice . 
  i had to change their location . 
  it 's sad , but true '' , he declared to the rzeszow news portal . 
  from the same wikipedia article , `` 3 '' means caged farming . 
   caged : this had a requirement of 550 cm \u00b2 minimum space per hen . 
  however the eu has banned battery cages by 2012 through an update of ec directive 1999/74/ec . 
  ** the new minimum is 750 cm \u00b2 in furnished cages . 
  ** so it 's not that you ca n't buy eggs marked with a 3 . 
  just that the `` 3 '' marking now mean 750 cm \u00b2 in furnished cages ( picture 2 , `` enriched cages '' in the pictures linked ) instead of 550 cm \u00b2 battery cages ( picture 1 ) . 
  and countries with `` bad armies '' would feel disadvantaged , and would never agree to finance such a deal .

  are you sure ? 
  i did n't read much into it , but i assumed that stuff like the `` emergency brake '' on benefits of non-uk nationals ( the treaties do specify that there can be no discrimination of eu nationals regarding work rights ) , or removing the `` ever closer union '' phrasing from the treaties would actually require a treaty change . 
  do you have any source that these do not require treaty changes ? 
  ps : just to make sure , since text usually makes it harder to discern intent - i 'm not calling you a liar . 
  it 's just that i assumed these changes required an actual treaty change ( or at least , had to undergo the typical `` eu law '' ratification process ) , so i 'd be interested in reading an explanation why that 's not the case . 
  i do n't disagree with your opinion that there should be no forced migration quotas , you do not have to try and convince me of that . 
  i am also very critical at most of the eu-level decisions regarding migration over the last few years . 
  all i 'm saying is , the lisbon treaty clearly specifies immigration , including * illegal immigration * ( tfeu art . 
  79 paragraph 2c ) as sole competencies of the eu ( because shengen is also a competency of the eu ) , and that they should be decided using qmv . 
  as much as you do not agree with the decisions taken following these treaty rules , my point is that they are not arbitrary , illegal or against the treaties . 
  they also required a qualified majority of countries in the council to be in favour of them !, 
  now , that said , you could of course campaign for a treaty change , but that 's something else entirely . 
  calling a referendum in a single country because somehow the decisions at the eu-level were undemocratic , is the wrong way forward , as for them to have passed a qualified majority must have agreed with them , and your country also signed a treaty where you agreed to follow qmv decisions on immigration ( even if your country disagreed with any of those decisions ) !, 
  i mean , if you really must call a referendum , the only logical possibility i see would be to ask whether people wish to leave the eu instead ( and as such no longer having to follow any qmv decision at eu-level ) ... 
  anything else is pure demagogy . 
  note : `` you '' here does not refer to you specifically , instead to everyone in this thread who agreed with orban 's referendum . 
  [ article 79 tfeu ] ( https://europadatenbank.iaaeu.de/user/view_legalact.php?id=72 ) ( emphasis mine )  1 . 
  the union shall develop a common immigration policy aimed at ensuring , at all stages , ** the efficient management of migration flows ** , fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in member states , and the prevention of , and enhanced measures to combat , illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings . 
  for the purposes of paragraph 1 , ** the european parliament and the council ** , acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure , shall adopt measures in the following areas :  ( a ) ** the conditions of entry and residence ** , and standards on the issue by member states of long-term visas and residence permits , including those for the purpose of family reunification ;  ( b ) the definition of the rights of third-country nationals residing legally in a member state , including the conditions governing freedom of movement and of residence in other member states ;  ( c ) ** illegal immigration and unauthorised residence ** , including removal and repatriation of persons residing without authorisation ;  ( d ) combating trafficking in persons , in particular women and children it * can * be joint with national governments or not . 
  in this case , it 's clearly not . 
  it is true that ( according to the same tfeu article 79 paragraph 5 ) member states have the right to determine volumes of admission of third-country nationals ( eu can not impose immigration quotas per se ) , but under the current `` forced '' migration quotas orban is so against , a country may decline to participate , and instead pay into the system ( `` ensuring , at all stages , the efficient management of migration flows '' , which is a competency solely of the eu ) , which means , technically , a member state can still decide not to have migration quotas `` forced '' on it . 
  but the thing is , it 's not arbitrary . 
  [ the lisbon treaty lists * all * issues that the eu has competency in , and which ones of those require unanimity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#policy_areas ) in this specific case , `` immigration '' is an issue that , as of lisbon , is voted using qmv ( article 79 tfeu ), 
   a german lapdog donald deliberatelly made it a majority based vote and stripped member states from their veto rights . 
  the lisbon treaty , which all eu countries ratified , allows certain issues ( including migration/borders ) to be voted under qmv . 
  so , on these issues , member states * do not have * individual veto rights . 
  a blocking minority is required to actually block a decision , which in the migration quota case the opposing countries did not manage to assemble . 
  you may disagree with that , and i understand your point of view regarding the `` undemocratic council '' ( although i am pro-federalization , i want the legislative power to be based around the euparl instead of the council for similar reasons ) but your parliament * did * agree to these rules when they ratified lisbon , giving up any and all veto rights on specific issues . 
  it 's ridiculous to say that qmv in the council is `` illegal '' or that someone decided to strip member states from their veto rights `` just because '' . 
  ps : i also disagree with migrant quotas . 
   btw , in the rio grande do sul brazilians also say `` tu '' , god knows why . 
  god knows why the rest of you guys say `` voc\u00ea '' instead :p but yeah , differences between european and brazillian portuguese are always interesting/funny . 
  one time , i was talking with a brazillian friend who was n't used to european portuguese , and we were talking about some girl and said she was a `` rapariga bonita '' ( `` beautiful girl '' ; `` rapariga '' meaning `` girl '' ) somewhere mid-sentence . 
  our friend is really shocked , why are we insulting that girl ? 
  turns out , `` rapariga '' has a slightly different meaning in brazillian - `` whore '' . 
  no , the `` vos '' form is so old fashioned , it 'd be like if you were speaking with the king 100 years ago or something . 
  most natives ca n't even conjugate the `` vos '' form of many verbs , because nobody uses it . 
  we actually can use `` voc\u00ea '' ( + `` ele '' form of verbs ) as a formal way of speech ( `` voc\u00ea podia fazer-me um favor ? '', 
  = formal `` could you do me a favor ? 
  '' ) , but we usually say `` o senhor '' ( `` sir '' ) instead , or ommit it entirely ( `` o senhor podia fazer-me um favor ? '', 
  as far as i know , in brazillian portuguese `` voc\u00ea '' is an informal form of speech ( equivalent to the `` tu '' form ) , so it 's very different . 
  [ there wo n't be a second round , sorry . 
  well , you might have a chance to vote soon , depending on how the current government holds up , so do n't be too sad , 
   60-days law could you explain that ? 
  i have no idea what this law is . 
  that is n't the complete picture , though ( it 's not supposed to be just `` extra taxes '' ) :  the new arrangements will enable the eurozone to create its own fiscal capacity . 
  revenue will be raised from new ` genuine ' own resources , the subject currently being explored by a high level interinstitutional group under the leadership of mario monti . 
  a eurozone budget of roughly the same size as the current eu budget ( about 1 % gdp ) would give the commission over time the capacity to intervene meaningfully to support contra-cyclical adjustments , for instance through the instrument of a common unemployment insurance scheme . 
  the budget would also be used for investment in large-scale european public goods with real european added value , for example in the field of r&d , energy infrastructure or security measures . 
  the transfer upwards of such expenditure items from national to eu budgets as well as , on the revenue side , the replacement of direct gni contributions by genuine own resources will serve to save national treasuries money . 
   as is the case with the us , the larger the federal budget at its disposal , the less intrusive would the commission need to be in the realm of domestic budgets . 
  with the extra leverage the commission would gain as a result of its new fiscal capacity , the common economic policy should focus on structural reform and the stabilisation of public finance , leaving the national authorities , coordinated in the eurogroup , room for adjustment at state and regional level . 
   the scope of article 136 has to be widened from the narrow demands of fiscal discipline to embrace the possible development of a common economic policy . 
  the introduction of a federal fiscal policy requires the eu to gain powers , at least as far as the eurozone is concerned , for the harmonisation of the structure of taxes and even for the setting of certain tax rates . 
  the prohibitions applying to the eu as a whole in taxation matters will be lifted for the eurozone . 
  as a complement to the new fiscal capacity , we also suggest that much greater salience is given in the economic policy mix at eu level to employment policy . 
  the prohibition on the harmonisation of national employment law should be disapplied for the eurozone . 
   so with an enriched policy mix and provided with meaningful fiscal policy instruments , the commission should be able to provide a clear macro-economic framework within which the policy actors can work at the national and subnational levels . 
  no doubt to the relief of the european central bank , the acquisition by the commission of powerful fiscal policy tools will reduce the political pressure on monetary policy-making , allowing mario draghi to return to more orthodox central banking . 
  the mandate of the ecb will have to be adjusted so that it is charged to support , through its monetary policy , the objectives of the common economic policy , including full employment . 
  but yes , it 's probably the `` least likely '' part of the whole proposal . 
  read the page , it contains the abstract :  at a time when the eu finds itself in a perfect storm of crises which it seems unable to overcome , a bold move is needed to reinvigorate the eu 's system of government and stave off the risk of disintegration . 
  in order to address the inherent weakness of the eu 's monetary and economic governance , this pamphlet proposes a new treaty for the eurozone : the protocol of frankfurt . 
  written by andrew duff , former member of the european parliament and visiting fellow at the epc , it is the first ever attempt to draft a treaty aimed at setting up a fiscal union . 
  `` the protocol of frankfurt provides the constitutional framework for a proper economic government and will , hopefully , also serve to accelerate the debate on the five presidents ' report '' . 
  realising that the time is not ripe for a major constitutional overhaul , the pamphlet instead puts forward a shorter treaty revision that concentrates on re-engineering the maastricht arrangements for the economic and monetary union , taking on the form of a protocol to be added on to the existing treaties . 
  article 48 ( 2 ) of the treaty on european union allows the government of any member state , the european parliament or the commission to table amendments to the treaties .
