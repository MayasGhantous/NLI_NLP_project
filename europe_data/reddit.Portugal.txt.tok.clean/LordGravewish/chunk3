  since when is democracy defined as the uk choosing a commission president through back-room deals and vetoing the one everyone else wants ( as happened multiple times in the past , see barroso ) , the one who actually ran for elections for the first time ? 
  if the commission president had been chosen by back-room deals as usual in the past , you 'd be complaining that was also undemocratic ( i 've never even once heard barroso 's presidency being called ` democratic ' by any of you , and you 're campaigning for more of that ! ) .

  a lot of small towns or villages are named `` vila nova da [ something here ] '' ( lit . 
  `` new village of [ something here ] '' ) . 
  many of them have weird-sounding names nobody 's heard of before , so to talk about backwater locations as a stereotype you just pick a random name that does n't exist ( hopefully ) . 
  i like to use `` vila nova da buganhanha '' . 
  as far as i know , cameron and the british public ca n't vote for the bundestag , right ? 
  she and her coalition care more about being re-elected in germany , their own country , than about appeasing cameron and keeping the uk in the eu at all costs ... 
  i see nothing wrong with this , though , and i 'm not even german . 
  i would hope all eu memberstates ' leaders would act as she has - she was elected to * protect * german interests , not to succumb to open * blackmail * from the uk . 
  because most countries in the eu would actually prefer the eu parliament to have more power than the council , since the euparl is a much more open institution ( though it should still be improved ) . 
  a lot of what 's wrong with the eu can be traced back to the fact that decisions are taken by few and forced on the many - germany , france and the uk have way too much power in the council . 
  on top of that , blackmailing merkel publicly ( `` if you choose juncker , we 'll leave the eu '' ) when the public opinion in germany was that juncker won the vote and thus should have been elected did n't help , it only rallied people to juncker 's cause - if she were ever not to support juncker now , she 'd look weak to her voters and most likely lose the next election ( i can imagine the opposition : `` merkel and the cdu do n't care about democracy and german people , they only care about doing what cameron tells them to ! '' ... 
  she 'd be ridiculed nationally for weeks . ), 
  the only other way out would be for juncker to give up the spot voluntarily , but he 's said multiple times he wo n't . 
  ironically , he might have actually succeeded against juncker had he not publicly blackmailed merkel . 
  that or he would have come home with many assurances and a high post in the commission ( vice-presidency ? ), 
  and saved face . 
  merkel did n't really want juncker either , actually , but her hand was forced by cameron 's ridiculous blackmailing attempt . 
  now all he 's going to get is a humiliating defeat and a commission president he does n't want who now hates his guts after witnessing the uk propaganda campaign against him and his family . 
  he 's also given even more ammo to ukip through his vilification of juncker than if he 'd stayed quiet and done nothing ( stuff like `` cameron ca n't successfully stand up against the eussr ! '', 
  and even more calls for a referendum ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** public opinion in the eu ( those that actually know about this , at least ) , including in germany , is mostly on juncker 's side . 
  cameron then screwed up hugely with his public blackmail attempt . 
  merkel now has to choose juncker if she does n't want to look really weak to the german public . 
  why does it seem he 's redefined the meaning of the word `` consensus '' as `` everyone must agree with me '' ? 
   the russian annexation of russia well , that 's the first time i 've heard of a country annexing itself , 
  i 'll be having an exam on advanced computer architectures ... 
   my propositions are strictly regarding the parliament : make it representative within measure you 're defining representative as `` every country has the same number of meps '' . 
  you 're ignoring the fact that the euparl is supposed to represent the * people * of europe , ** not ** the countries . 
  countries that have more meps like germany and france already have much fewer meps per person than other countries , and you 're making it much worse . 
  ideally the euparl should have a constant number of meps per person everywhere in europe - but that is only feasible if the eu were split up into nuts2 level or something similar , in each every member `` state '' would have a very similar population size . 
  ( similar how to the german federation works - states are redrawn every few years in order to keep the population count the same so that the parliament is linearly representative ) . 
  the council is what you want - a house in which * countries * ( ** not ** people ) are represented , since every country - no matter their size - gets the same number of votes , very similar to the us senate . 
  if you want to make something more representative , try enlarging the council so each country has more `` senators '' ( the us has 2 per state , for example ) and make them directly electable instead of the current system of back-room deals within each national government . 
   make eu poltical parties separate from national parties if you 'd read the manifesto ( and the more detailed links at the bottom of it ) , you 'd know this is exactly one thing they suggest ( pan-european lists , instead of national ones ) . 
   establish a way for people ( even within a single country ) to suspend the passing of a certain legislation and ask a eu wide referendum over it . 
  there already is that - [ european citizen 's initiative ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome ) , though it does n't go necessarily to a referendum , but forces the commission to react and draft/repeal legislation . 
  you do understand that nowhere in this manifesto does it say `` we want to keep the status quo , where germany and france lead the union '' . 
  people in favour of a federation do not want to give more power to the council/commission/euparl just like that - they want to reform the whole system from top to bottom . 
  try reading the link you posted under , it contains explanation of what they want to do . 
  [ this page ] ( http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/federal-political-union/ ) about the political system they propose is slightly more detailed . 
  this excerpt might help :  we would transfer to the european commission most of the executive powers now held by the council.the size of the commission should be reduced , with its members nominated by the president -- elect and elected by the european parliament . 
  taking decisions by qualified majority vote would become the norm . 
  the task of the european council should be to steer and manage the council of ministers . 
  this would lead to a directly elected parliament electing a parliamentary supported government , like any constitutional republic . 
  the end-result of removing most powers from the council is exactly what you want - remove power from the current national governments ( who end up following the strongest few , germany and france ) , and then split it up more equally among the union and among the populace . 
  finally , nothing is set in stone . 
  part of what they want to do is [ convene a constitutional convention and have an open eu-wide discussion on the subject ] ( http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/treaty-change-convention/ ) , and if all goes well draft a real eu constitution that 's much better than the one that was show down a few years ago . 
  which part of  were given the concessions they wanted before the second vote and  an eu leaders summit agreed to keep 1 commissioner per member state and to incorporate legally binding guarantees on abortion , taxation and military neutrality is hard for you to understand ? 
  check [ this list ] ( http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/who-to-vote-for/ ) of mep candidates who signed this manifesto ( 67 were elected ) . 
  maybe you 'll find some ( or maybe not ) . 
   which i regard as dangerous foolishness . 
  [ i regard ukip meps as dangerous fools . 
  ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2014/report_smc_final_report_june2014-9013.pdf )  re referendums being passed , notably , several of those that passed did so only after rejecting it and being told to vote until they got the answer right , and this was at the high-tide of pro-ever-closer-union sentiment . 
  [ you 're wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_establishing_a_constitution_for_europe#ratification ) , that 's common euro-cynic misinformation :  spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the constitution . 
  on 20 february 2005 , ** spanish voters backed the treaty with 76 % voting in favour to 24 % against ** , on a turnout of 43 % . 
  [ 5 ]  on 29 may 2005 the ** french public rejected the constitution by margin of 55 % to 45 % ** on a turnout of 69 % . 
  just three days later , the ** dutch rejected the constitution by a margin of 61 % to 39 % ** on a turnout of 62 % . 
   notwithstanding the rejection in france and the netherlands , ** luxembourg held a referendum on 10 july 2005 approving the constitution by 57 % to 43 % ** . 
  it was the last referendum to be held on the constitution as all of the other member states that had proposed to hold referendums cancelled them . 
  spain passed it the first time , as did luxembourg . 
  so , 2 countries passed it after referendum , and 2 rejected it . 
  it 's highly likely that enough countries would pass the referendum ( as long as it 's drafted correctly and openly ) that such a two-tiered system would work . 
  the rest could later join if they wanted , or just stay out and keep conditional access to the single market . 
  [ as for the lisbon treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratification_of_the_treaty_of_lisbon ) ( which i was n't talking about , but euro-cynics tend to get both of these confused - like you did ) :  the result of the referendum on 12 june 2008 was in opposition to the treaty , with ** 53.4 % against the treaty and 46.6 % in favour ** , in a 53.1 % turnout . 
  a week later , the results of a eurobarometer survey conducted hours after the vote were released , [ 108 ] indicating why the electorate voted as they did . 
  on 10 september , the government published the more in-depth research analysis on voters ' stated reasons for voting yes or no : ** this concluded that the primary reason for rejection was `` lack of knowledge/information / understanding '' **  [ ... ] member states would agree not to reduce the number of commissioners and ireland would hold another vote in september or october 2009 after receiving guarantees on abortion , taxation and military neutrality . 
  [ 110 ] on 12 december 2008 the taoiseach , brian cowen confirmed that * a second referendum would be held , after an eu leaders summit agreed to keep 1 commissioner per member state and to incorporate legally binding guarantees on abortion , taxation and military neutrality in the croatian accession treaty . 
  * [ 111 ]  the second referendum on the treaty took place on 2 october 2009 . 
  the final result was ** 67.1 % in favour to 32.9 % against , with a turnout of 59 % ** so the irish either did n't know enough to make a choice and were then better informed for the second vote , or they voted against for real reasons and were given the concessions they wanted before the second vote . 
  i do n't see how you can call this `` being told to vote the right way '' . 
  it 's called * listening to the electorate * , actually . 
  happy to see that about 67 elected meps for the 2014 euparl have signed this manifesto , including a portuguese mep ( ana gomes , with the socialist party ) . 
  the list includes guy verhofstadt ( leader of the alde group ) . 
  i think something like this could work , especially if the two-tiered system was developed ( for example for the uk ) . 
  the european federalists want to convene a pan-eu , open and democratic constitutional conference to change the treaties , and then put it to referendum everywhere . 
  anyone know what the process would be for convening such a conference ? 
  do they need a majority in the council or something ? 
  i wonder if it 'll be possible to do nowadays , what with all the anti-eu sentiment in a lot of countries . 
  provided a fair number of countries pass the referendum ( like last time , where a majority of those who had the referendum actually passed it ) , it should go forward and those who rejected it get put into the second tier of a two-tiered eu which would have full ( conditional ) access to the single market without the regulations/laws/loss of sovereignty that are n't connected with that aspect of the union . 
  in this way , countries who want out ( with benefits ) like the uk would be able to do so under a controlled manner ( without being able to pick-and-choose ) while those who want in a democratic eu that does n't just get dragged down by all the closed-doors shady bullshit , with a fully-working parliamentary system that elects a government ( getting rid of the commission like it is today - something like what they describe [ here ] ( http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/federal-political-union/ ) ) get their way , too . 
  we would finally have a strong , unified voice to deal with internal and international affairs . 
  everybody 's happy !, 
  well , if i 'm already suggesting stuff , why do n't we split the countries who join that federal eu into the nuts2 level or something similar , states with similar population count/gdp ( hell , give all the secessionist factions in the eu independence , under the bigger political federation - that should make them happy ) in order to get a fair , proportional allocation of meps ? 
  this distribution of `` member states '' should be redrawn every once in a while to make sure that they still have similar population/gdp levels , in order to keep the system as fair as possible . 
  we 'd finally get out of the `` nothing in the eu happens without calling berlin first , and paris second , london third and checking if they allow it '' bullshit we 've had since forever that 's screwing over everyone else ( not that everyone else needs the eu to screw themselves over - some of us * cough * seem quite talented at screwing ourselves over without much help , not that that 's a good thing ) . 
   it certainly seems to me it looks like a power grab via shady circumstances . 
  please explain how this constitutes a power grab ** via shady circumstances ** . 
  the fact that the euparl * elects * the commission president ( whereas the council * proposes * the president ) is what is written in the treaties , and look at any country ( including the uk , the council would be the queen ) to see how this is supposed to work ( tip : the one who proposes the candidate to parliament has no real choice on the matter - they 're supposed to choose the leader of the party who won the votes , and if they ca n't get majority then travel down to the rest of the party leaders . 
  only if no party can manage to build a government should compromise candidates who are n't the party leaders but can build a majority be proposed ) . 
  also , the euparl has more * eu-wide legitimacy * right now ( it was just elected through universal eu suffrage , so they currently represent the eu as a whole much better ) than the governments of the very small number of countries who want the status quo - where they 're the ones who pick the commission president through a closed-doors backroom deal * via shady circumstances * . 
  the system might not be perfect , but it 's much better than what there was before - i 'm tired of everything in the eu , including its leadership being decided behind closed doors in the council where only a few countries ( germany , france , uk mostly ) have a real say . 
  do n't confuse the `` president '' of the commission with a president of a country . 
  it 's more like a `` president of the government '' or what is usually called a `` prime minister '' , so the parliamentary election system ( indirect vote for the prime minister ) would be expected and makes sense . 
  ** tl ; dr ** from the last page ( emphasis mine ) :  the eu 's critics claim that its rules do little to enhance british trade with the continent , that they hold back britain 's economy and that they limit its trade with fast-growing economies outside europe . 
   yet this report shows that ** trade , investment and financial flows between britain and the continent are much larger than would be the case if the single market did not exist ** . 
  it finds that ** eu rules do little damage to britain 's economy ** and that they do not account for its lacklustre trade with emerging economies . 
   if britain voted to leave the eu , it would face an invidious choice in the subsequent negotiations : * full access to the european single market , with little influence on the rules that govern it * ; or * freedom from those rules , with less access to the market * .
