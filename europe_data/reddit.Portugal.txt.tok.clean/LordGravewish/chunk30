  our hope is that somebody , informed by this draft protocol , does just that . 
  it 's actually pretty well written . 
  i managed to read through the whole thing ( except for the last chapter , which is the actual proposed treaty they spent the previous chapters describing ) . 
  it goes through the political events in the eu chronologically , explaining the causes of all the problems and ( hasty ) attempts to fix them , why those fixes were chosen at the time , and why they did n't work . 
  it then describes multiple possibilities forward ( including the possibility of a `` willing '' disintegration ) and ( since it 's a pro-eu thinktank , and pro-eu writer ) concludes in a short treaty revision that would fit inside the current treaty framework ( so it 's no `` legal impossibility '' ) as well as political climate , as a first step of a way forward that ( they think ) is best and could get the eurozone out of the current crisis . 
  basically , it describes a core eurozone `` federal '' level with it 's own budget and government , the creation of a eurozone treasury , the creation of a proper parliamentary system ( consisting of eurozone meps ) to support the eurozone government . 
  it also asks for the creation of a legal procedure for leaving the euro ( zone ) voluntarily and in friendly terms ( if a state ever wants to ) . 
  it 's much better argued than any similar proposal i 've read before ( i 'm not doing it justice with the above summary ) , so if you 're interested in the subject i 'd recommend reading it - it 's only 24 pages if you do n't read the actual legalese at the end ( even then , if you want to be even quicker , read the `` democratic choices under simplified procedures '' chapter only , which describes their basic suggestions in 3 or so pages ) . 
  yeah , he 's basically saying the commission will trigger the guillotine clauses if there 's no agreement ( plan a ) , and switzerland goes through with plan b ( unilaterally changing the current agreements ) . 
  `` qual '' means `` which '' or `` what [ thing ] '' . 
  you want `` o qu\u00ea ? '', 
  i 'm really not sure , but maybe now with switzerland willing to give up banking secrecy it might be possible . 
  otherwise , the guillotine clauses attached to free movement are bad news for the swiss economy . 
  supposedly yes , but the fact that they are unelected ( or at most , elected during normal `` national government '' elections ) makes it so that voters are not able to make them responsible for their decisions . 
  i 'm of the opinion a two-chamber system needs to have direct elections for both chambers , and the council still does n't . 
  eh , i specifically chose a news piece that was as general as can be ( `` hey guys , there 's something going down in brussels ! '', 
  and not much more ) because of that ... 
  i mean the fact that * something * is going on is already out there , and ton of news sites have posted at least that much . 
  the request from the police is regarding * detailed * police location and movements , something that this article ( and articles from all other main news organizations ) does n't really go into detail . 
  but sure , i guess that 's fine . 
   even if we assume that all of the 8.2 % of respondents who knew of him voted , ( reaching your 15 % ) if we assume * all * the 8.2 % voted , then that 's about 19.2 % of the votes legitimizing the spitzenkandidaten system . 
  i did round it down to 15 % to account for people who , while informed , might not have voted or voted for parties who were against that system . 
   this is n't really my argument . 
  the question over which system is best in terms of nominations for the head of the european commission is a separate question from how british people voted . 
  then what exactly is your argument ? 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm being dumb or whatever , but i do n't seem to have understood it yet . 
  i mean , you replied to a poster who said that juncker was only there because people voted for him and he ( juncker ) should remember that when making decisions , by saying brits did n't vote for juncker , implying he should n't be there . 
  what was your point , if not that the council should have nominated someone else for that position instead , or that the uk should leave the eu in order for juncker ( or whoever else got that position ) not to have any power over you ? 
   i do think the fact that juncker has huge power over the uk and nobody in the uk really has heard of him , voted for him or understands his powers is massively worrying . 
  is that really solely the fault of the eu institutions , though ? 
  is n't the blame much more on the media and tabloids that spread misinformation about how the eu works , focus mostly on national issues ( ignoring any eu-wide campaign , for example * all * main uk broadcasters - including public ones like the bbc - refused to air the spitzenkandidaten debates live , even after being offered the rights for free as a matter of public interest ) and the fact that countries do not seem to educate people on how these institutions are supposed to work ( for example , do kids today learn about the eu institutions in civics classes ? 
  in portugal they do not ) . 
  i mean , the eu institutions are complex , but they 're not * that * difficult to at least have a basic understanding of , but most people i know could n't even tell the council and commission apart . 
   difference of ideologies is not my main argument . 
  i understand that , and i did not mean to say otherwise . 
  i was talking about that argument specifically ( that no brit voted for juncker ) , which focuses mostly on difference of ideologies ( in terms of the future of the eu ) , and does not even touch most other issues the brits ( and eu-sceptics in general ) seem to have with the eu . 
   he does n't have legitimacy not because brits did not vote for him , but because almost nobody voted for him . 
  [ only 8.2 % of respondents were able to name the epp candidate , jean-claude juncker ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/post-election-survey-shows-mixed-results-for-spitzencandidate-process/ ) . 
  assuming that people who knew of him were the most likely to vote , that would correspond to about 15 % of the total vote ( 42.54 % turnout ) . 
  compared to 1 % for barroso ( i 'm assuming about half of portugal knew about barroso before he was chosen for the eu commission , and almost nobody else ) . 
  i 'd say it 's a significant improvement , and gives him much more legitimacy than any previous commission president . 
  of course , i 'm not arguing that he has * all * the legitimacy ( or even that he was chosen by a majority of the electorate ) . 
  but you have to remember that even with the campaign this time , it was still uncertain if the spitzenkandidaten system would even work ( or if the euparl would be unable to uphold it 's interpretation of the lisbon treaties in the end , and be forced to accept a different nominee chosen by the council ) . 
  it 's very likely that the next euparl elections will see a much larger campaign budget , seeing as the spitzenkandidaten system has already been legitimized at the euparl ( especially if the proposition by the parliament of partially eu-wide lists passes in the council ) . 
  or did you expect the first ( indirectly ) elected candidate of the commission post-lisbon to be known by a majority of the eu electorate ? 
  you know fully well ( and it is a fair argument that i hear a lot from eu-sceptics ) that the `` eu demos '' , while slowly growing , still only encompasses a small amount of the population ( something similar to 8.2 % , i assume from the previous articles ? ) . 
  but we 're going off into unrelated subjects with this discussion . 
  ** my point was ** , it makes no sense to use the argument that no brit voted for juncker when arguing that juncker has no legitimacy for a eu institution , and that the better alternative is direct nomination by the council . 
  it * does * make sense to use that same argument to argue that juncker has little legitimacy over the uk , and therefore the uk should leave . 
  in context , reading the comment you originally replied to , you were arguing for the first ( juncker has no legitimacy for a eu institution ) . 
   the point that brits did not vote for junker is in my mind a good point to be made . 
  only if your single objective is to campaign for uk to leave the eu with `` difference of ideologies '' / `` they vote too differently than us '' as a main argument ( which is a valid argument , and i 'm not trying to downplay it ) if you 're trying to argue for juncker having less legitimacy just because no brit voted for him ( which is what it looks like in context ) , though , that argument makes no sense . 
  he has more eu-wide legitimacy than any nominee under the old system , seeing as this time , * there were actually 5-10 % of the eu electorate who did know of him * . 
  or do you argue that more people than that knew about barroso before he got chosen * twice * ? 
  ( `` electing juncker is undemocratic because only 5-10 % of the electorate knew he was a candidate !, 
  so let 's nominate someone even less people know about by negotiating behind closed doors - that 'll be democratic ! '' ), 
   nobody in the uk voted for him this time so , nobody voted for the labour party ( pes , 24.43 % ) ? 
  nobody voted for the greens ( egp , 6.91 % ) ? 
  nobody voted for the snp ( efa , 2.37 % ) ? 
  nobody voted for the liberals ( alde , 6.61 % ) ? 
  ** all ** these parties supported the spitzenkandidaten system ( totalling 41 % of the vote ) , and their corresponding european party fielded a candidate for the commission , an indirect election similar to the election of the head of government in a lot of eu countries . 
  after the elections , they ** all ** supported juncker for the position as the candidate of the winning epp , threatening to block the council if any other candidate was nominated . 
  or did you also not elect these 46 meps ? 
  ( out of the 73 representing the uk , more than half ! ), 
  or are you angry that a candidate won from an european party that has no representation in the uk ? 
  well , guess what , the conservatives left the epp a few years ago , and nobody in the uk has formed a party allied to the epp after that . 
  are you going to ignore everyone else in europe who * did * have parties allied to the epp , and gave * them * a majority , just because * you * do n't ? 
  since when does that make sense ? 
  sure , many people were n't informed that they were also electing the commission president indirectly this time . 
  but every attempt was made to inform people , including live debates broadcasted all over the eu ( * including * the uk ! ) . 
  there were a ton of parties who did not field candidates , but people did n't vote for them . 
  if people vote in an election without knowing who their party supports for such an important position , and then complain when the winning party 's candidate gets nominated , do you blame the party for not informing the people ? 
  if anything , this shows that the euparl * needs * european-wide lists , so that even uninformed people know that they are voting for an eu party/candidate , instead of voting only along national issues . 
  juncker has much more legitimacy in his current position ( even if a lot of the voting public was unaware of him ) than any candidate that could have been nominated in shady back-room deals in the council using the previous system , which david cameron advocated for . 
  such a candidate would actually be the one without legitimacy ! . 
  ( `` electing juncker is undemocratic because only 10 % of the electorate knew he was a candidate !, 
  so let 's nominate someone even less people know about by negotiating behind closed doors ! '' ), 
  look , i respect that you are anti-eu and i agree with you on a lot of things you say in a lot of your comments here ( even i dislike juncker ) , but i 'm getting tired of hearing you ( and other redditors ) spout such non-sense . 
  do n't ukip just vote against everything on the euparl on purpose ? 
  i thought that was the case . 
  psd and cds-pp are as pro-eu as it gets . 
  ps was the party that campaigned to bring us into the eu and the euro a couple decades ago , at a time when psd and cds-pp were still relatively euroskeptic ... 
  they 're still pro-eu . 
  those 3 parties include about 75 % of the parliament . 
  must i say more ? 
  but let 's continue . 
  be ( ~ 15 % ) is pro-eu ( different type of eu , sure , more like how syriza is pro-eu , but they still do n't advocate for leaving ) . 
  the only openly euroskeptic party ( `` we should leave '' ) are the communists , with about 10 % of the vote, 
  you have to remember that he 's at the end of his mandate . 
  in any other situation where he might have wanted to refuse a government by a specific coalition , he could just dissolve the parliament instead of setting up a caretaker government ^ ( 1 ) . 
  now , only the new president , after the elections in january , will be able to do so . 
  in addition , the president is directly elected , such that his office carries enough legitimacy for the powers granted to it . 
  thirdly , his argument is against the anti-eu/nato parties , which had about 20 % of the vote . 
  it 's hard to state that that 's a `` majority '' of the population . 
  i agree that if he actually refuses to nominate ps for government , his decision will be challenged , mainly at the constitutional court . 
  but unless ps presents an official 4-year agreement with both pcp and be ( and all signs point to that not being the case , for all we know we 're looking at two separate agreements - one with be and one with pcp - to `` not veto the government program and the budget right after the nomination '' , so 1-year , without a real coalition ) , the case will most likely just be thrown out . 
  this actually has happened before , in 1987 , when the socialist president m\u00e1rio soares refused to nominate a majority coalition between the runner-up ps and the third-largest party in the parliament prd , dissolving the parliament instead . ), 
  the telegraph is wrong , there still is n't any kind of leftist coalition . 
  it is likely there will be one , but right now , they 're still negotiating , and have refused to present any details to the public . 
  some portuguese sources ( translated by me ; try google translate if you want to check yourself ) :  ps secretary-general [ ant\u00f3nio costa ] says he 's more determined to conclude the agreement with pcp , pev and be after cavaco silva 's attacks [ source ] ( http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/ps-promete-muralha-daco-erguida-ate-segundafeira-1712181 )  pcp secretary general refuses to reveal details of the negotiations with the socialists .
