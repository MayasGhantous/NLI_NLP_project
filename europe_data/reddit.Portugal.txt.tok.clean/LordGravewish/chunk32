  on the other hand , the [ us federal budget is around 22 % of gdp ] ( https://ycharts.com/indicators/govt_spend_gdp ) . 
  the economist has [ an article ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union ) with better stats on the fiscal transfers in the us ( copied here to avoid the paywall , emphasis mine ) :  some american states receive more in federal spending than they pay in federal taxes ; others receive less . 
  over twenty years these fiscal transfers can add up to a sizeable sum . 
  ** from 1990 to 2009 , the federal government spent $ 1.44 trillion in virginia but collected less than $ 850 billion in taxes , a gap of over $ 590 billion ** . 
  but relative to the size of its economy , virginia derived a smaller benefit from america 's fiscal union than ** states like new mexico , mississippi and west virginia , where the 20-year transfer exceeded 200 % of their annual gdp . 
  ** ** transfers to puerto rico , which is a us territory not a fully incorporated state , exceeded 290 % ** . 
  where did these transfers come from ? 
  ** new york transferred over $ 950 billion to the rest of america 's fiscal union from 1990 to 2009 . 
  ** but relative to the size of its economy , ** delaware made the biggest contribution , equivalent to more than twice its 2009 gdp . 
  ** these calculations are based on tax figures provided by the internal revenue service ( which used to bracket washington , dc , with maryland ) and federal spending numbers provided by the census bureau , which ignores spending on international programmes and interest payments . 
  15 states received over 100 % of their gdp through fiscal transfers in 20 years . 
  four states received over 200 % of their whole gdp !, 
  in particular , puerto rico ( not even a full state ! ), 
  received 291 % of its gdp . 
  that would amount to greece receiving around 615bn $ of * fiscal transfers * ( i.e. , money which does n't have to be paid back , such that bail-outs do n't count ) in the same time-frame . 
  this corresponds to about ** five ** years of the current * full * eu budget or , at the current rate , eu budget spending in greece ( subtracting the greek contributions ) over a period of around ** 120 years ** !, 
  eurozone fiscal transfers are basically non-existant , at least when compared to what would be required for an [ optimum currency area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) , and that is one of its biggest flaws . 
  no idea who 's right or wrong , but that page does state quite clearly that it is a `` draft '' and `` not for implementation '' , and `` contains nonbinding recommendations '' . 
  it also states that `` this guidance is being distributed for comment purposes only . '', 
  yeah , and that 's not exclusive to france . 
  you , as an eu national , have the right to vote for municipal and european elections of any other eu country , as long as you are registered as a resident . 
  you are also allowed to stand as a candidate for european elections . 
  [ article 22 of the tfeu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012e/txt ) :  1 . 
  every citizen of the union residing in a member state of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the member state in which he resides , under the same conditions as nationals of that state . 
  without prejudice to article 223 ( 1 ) and to the provisions adopted for its implementation , every citizen of the union residing in a member state of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the european parliament in the member state in which he resides , under the same conditions as nationals of that state . 
  [ ... ] it 's one of the many reasons i am pro-eu . 
  a deal not being reached was always a threat by the greek government . 
  syriza were elected on a very anti-austerity platform , and it was obvious at the time that the eurozone would never agree to that . 
  especially as soon as the referendum was called , a `` no '' vote ( if followed through ) was known by everyone to mean a greek default , however much the `` no '' campaign tried to deny it . 
  in the end , tsipras knew the consequences of following through with the `` no '' vote and was too much of a coward to call his bluff . 
  as such , there would always be the threat of banking collapse due to greece defaulting and leaving the euro , ela or not . 
  it would just have come much sooner . 
  this is why there was a bank run in the first place - people and business were scared that their money would be forcefully converted to worthless drachma if the negotiations turned sour , not that elas would be cancelled . 
  as for the ecb increasing ela regularly , no country had ever required values as large as 89bn $ . 
  elas are supposed to be temporary and serve to absorb small shocks , however 89bn $ is way too much money for that . 
  anyways , at the start of the year they were already set at 60bn $ , and not increasing them would have meant an immediate greek collapse before the newly elected government could do anything about it . 
  would you have preferred if that had happened ? 
  because i 'm sure that it would have been considered by the public as even more political , a `` coup by the ecb against the newly democratically-elected government of greece '' . 
   the ecb could easily have determined what ` temporary ' really meant by giving a defined time-frame , and also by setting a maximum ceiling ( over which the ecb would not go ) at the beginning . 
  there would not be any uncertainty or any added worry with such an approach . 
  just fyi , ela limits were set by the ecb multiple times . 
  during the last week before the elas were stopped , the limits were [ increasing weekly ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2015/07/blogs/graphic-detail/20150711_woc874_3.png ) because greece kept going over them . 
  in fact , in case you misunderstood , elas were never `` cancelled '' per se . 
  instead , the ecb rejected any increase after 89bn $ . 
  our main point of disagreement here seems to be what the elas actually are . 
  the ecb 's ela procedures are [ here ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/201402_elaprocedures.en.pdf?10cc0e926699a1984161dc21722ca841 ) . 
  remember that these powers are codified into the treaties , and can not be used wily-nily . 
  in particular , the ecb 's board of governors has huge power in usage of these extreme measures . 
  it is also important to note that the elas are limited above 2bn $ and require the governing board to agree to anything . 
  remember that when they were cut off for the gcb , they were already up to 89bn $ , which is a huge amount of money . 
   i wish this had happened . 
  i 'm not very sure if the ecj will rule against the ecb , though . 
  again , the treaties are very strict on the ecb 's mandate , * by design * . 
  as you can see , the court case right now is not whether suspending the elas was against the treaties , and for a reason . 
  in fact , the ecb just has to show that the greek banks were not `` solvent financial institution [ s ] , or group [ s ] of solvent financial institutions , that [ were ] facing temporary liquidity problems '' , which , considering the state of banks in greece , should not be very difficult . 
  alternatively , it can argue that suspending the elas was to stop them `` interfer [ ing ] with the objectives and tasks of the eurosystem '' , per article 14.4 of the statute of the european system of central banks and of the european central bank . 
  in particular , these `` objectives and tasks of the eurosystem '' are : * defining and implementing monetary policy * conducting foreign exchange operations * holding and managing the euro area 's foreign currency reserves * promoting the smooth operation of payment systems, 
   the situation was temporary . 
  it was intermittently caused by the negotiations . 
  assuming the negotiations ended , it should also resolve . 
  a return to drachma without mutual agreement was becoming increasingly more likely , and in that case the situation would not be temporary . 
   if the ecb is not the lender of last resort , who is ? 
  this is exactly the question that we should be asking , because it is the crux of the problem !, 
  it might seem strange , but the lender of last resort for greece is the greek central bank , * not * the ecb . 
  the ecb does not and * can not by treaty * act as a lender of last resort . 
  this is in my opinion one of the worst mistakes of the euro , as the lenders of last resort do not control the currency , and thus can themselves run into huge liquidity issues which ends up making the problem worse . 
   not relevant . 
  the ecb and its governors have a mandate to uphold and their actions should be guided by it , whether it is a ` right ' or not . 
  their mandate does not include being the lender of last resort , so they were perfectly within their mandate to stop increasing the elas . 
   if it does not believe that ela should be provided ( or that the cb involved meets the criteria ) then it should not provide any ela . 
  there 's no basis for providing just a little ela , or going halfway to fixing the problem . 
  again , elas can only be provided if the liquidity problem is temporary . 
  if the ecb believes this to not be the case , it * can not by its own rules * provide more elas . 
  changing this would probably require a treaty change to give the ecb lender of last resort powers . 
   greek banks were solvent when cbg asked for help . 
  when they asked for help at first . 
  the week of the referendum , they were only solvent because of elas . 
  if elas stopped , they would go bust immediately due to a huge lack of liquidity ( there was a huge bank run on-going ) . 
  why else did the gcb have to institute capital controls ? 
   nor were they the fault of the cbg or the banks themselves . 
  sure , but the problem again is structural with the eurozone : the lender of last resort is * not * the ecb . 
  the responsibility to help insolvent banks as well as solvent banks during liquidity problems is the gcb 's alone . 
  it can do this by requesting help from the ecb , but the ecb is sadly not obliged to help by it 's mandate , if it considers doing so a bigger risk to stability of the * whole * eurozone than not doing anything . 
   ironically a fiscal union would result in the transfer of wealth to greece that greece was looking for through debt relief . 
  i know , but it would also imply a considerably bigger control of greek public finances by the non-greek electorates which will be paying the taxes that go to greece , since it implies a common budget and taxation system . 
  a fiscal union needs both . 
  ----------- do not misunderstand me , i 'm not saying that `` everything happened as it should '' , or that `` greece is to blame '' . 
  this is sadly not such a simple issue . 
  saying `` the ecb is the bad guy , and everything happened because of them '' ( i.e. 
  what varoufakis/diem25 come across as saying ) will not solve anything , just polarize the institutional dialogue even further . 
  it is not only `` greece 's fault '' , or `` ecb 's fault '' - this is *** everyone *** 's fault . 
  this whole problem lies in the institutional framework of the eurozone itself . 
  even the ecb itself has its hands tied in a lot of these decisions , as it * by design * requires the agreement of a majority of central banks to do almost anything , including elas ( the closest they have to being lenders of last resort ) . 
  the ecb was already going way above what the elas were supposed to be due in part to pressure by draghi , and there were already threats by some of the other central banks of taking the issue to the ecj , to force the ecb to stop increasing the elas `` illegally '' . 
  there had to be a point where a majority of the ecb 's council of governors would rebel and the `` ela lifeline '' would snap . 
  and a lot of it boils down to the ecb not being the lender of last resort , which is a huge issue for the stability of the eurozone . 
  however , changing this will be a huge undertaking and require deep treaty changes . 
  in particular , i very much doubt any rich country will agree to this unless they have strong assurances that countries will spend their budgets responsibly , i.e. 
  a fiscal union with ( partial ) common control of public finances . 
  i posted a comment on this when diem 's initiative for ecb transparency was first posted here on reddit , but that thread had very few upvotes so probably nobody read the comments .
