  here are the parts regarding the ecb actions :  the ecb did not force greece to close its banks . 
  the ecb has no power to force greece to close its banks , actually . 
  only the greek central bank does . 
   what happened was that after the deal collapsed , the ecb voted to stop increasing ela ( `` emergency liquidity assistance '' ) which are basically loans directly from the ecb to the greek central bank , meant to stave off ** temporary ** liquidity emergencies in the banking system . 
  `` temporary '' is the keyword here . 
  it is important to stress that the ecb is not the lender of last resort , which means that elas are ** not ** a right , and rely on a majority decision by the ecb council of governors . 
  relying on them should be a measure of last resort , since they may be cut off at any time . 
   the way the negotiations were going , it was looking increasingly likely that greece would leave the euro . 
  the ecb ( again , sadly not a lender of last resort ) is not allowed by its rules to lend infinite money to one specific central bank ( in this case , through ela ) if it does not find it credible that the liquidity problem is only ** temporary ** , with the decision up to the council of governors . 
  of course , a country leaving the euro on bad terms saddled with a ton of debt would certainly qualify as having `` permanent liquidity issues '' . 
  it could even be said ( and i distinctly remember reading expert opinions back then with similar thoughts ) that the ecb did not have a mandate to increase the ela as far as it did in the first place . 
   one could say that the ecb 's decision is what indirectly led to the greek central bank having the liquidity issue that forced them to close the banks ( and maybe even argue that they should have extended it further ) , but it 's a pure fabrication to say that the ecb forced greece to close the banks . 
   the economic conditions in greece , including bank run during the period after syriza winning the elections and especially when the negotiations stalled right before the referendum were no fault of the ecb . 
  instead , they were the combined result of political choices by greece ( both by the syriza government and over the previous decades ) , together with the conservative-majority power dynamics in the eurozone at the time ( power dynamics which still survive to this day , although weakened ) , that made it obvious to anyone who was not deluded that the only two possible ways out of the crisis would be austerity or drachma . 
  this is * not * a `` political '' conclusion , it is simply reality . 
  greek people and businesses with money in greece of course chose to withdraw their money in euros , instead of having it converted into worthless drachmas , and i do n't blame them as i would have too in the same situation . 
   [ see this article in the economist from back then ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/referendum-and-greek-banks ) i would support a campaign to change the ecb into a lender of last resort , but i am realistic and know that for there to even be a small chance of everyone agreeing and the resulting system being stable , it 'd need a fiscal union to support it . 
  enjoy !, 
  it 's a really good movie which i find myself recommending over and over . 
  super touching and depressingly bittersweet , too , so be prepared . 
  while a dramatized version , it is based on true events all along the front lines during ww1 , one of those movies where after watching i lose myself in thought for a couple of hours . 
  anyways , when someone says `` european production '' or `` movie with multiple european languages '' it 's always my first thought . 
  the ost is super good as well , i liked it so much that i ended up buying the album . 
  an under-watched gem , for sure . 
  not a huge budget ( $ 22,000,000 ) , but [ this ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424205/ ) might fit the bill . 
  it 's one of my favorite european movies , actually . 
   commitments under eu law wo n't apply after leaving the eu . 
  they have to be transcribed into international law ( which requires an agreement from both parties ) . 
  they are not commitments under eu law , that 's the thing . 
  they are things the uk signed to as a ** state ** . 
   if this were the case , it would be irrelevant as soon as the ecj loses jurisdiction over the uk . 
  the deal has to be in international law or it wo n't apply after brexit . 
  no , the deal was signed under the ecj 's jurisdiction , which by international law means that it falls under its jurisdiction as that is what the lisbon treaty falls into . 
  i 'm sure any deal will explicitly state that it falls under ecj jurisdiction anyways , to remove any legal ambiguities . 
  the alternative i can see would be the ehrc or icj , but the eu will never agree to the latter ( it might to the former ) . 
   this is n't true . 
  the uk can still unilaterally leave the eu . 
  please read my comments . 
  you can ( again you are sovereign ) , but you are breaking multiple treaties in the process . 
   this does n't really make sense . 
  if no agreement is made between the eu and the uk , the uk has `` gone back on its word '' ? 
  that 's not fair or true . 
  what stops the eu from refusing to negotiate ? 
  then the uk 's gone back on its word ? 
  the uk as a state officially says `` we will pay for these commitments '' , without conditioning it on being part of the eu . 
  it leaves the eu without any deal . 
  `` we will pay for these commitments '' is still the uk 's word , unless there is mutual agreement otherwise . 
  most of these commitments were done in a inter-governmental basis , not through eu law , which makes it even more likely to go in eu 's favor if it ever gets brought up to the icj/wto . 
   i do n't want to throw links at you because it 's patronising and terrible for debate , but there are plenty of sources stating that any eu country can unilaterally leave without using a50 . 
  that 's what makes them sovereign . 
  again , you are still breaking the treaty if you do so , and since you are party to the vienna convention on the law of treaties you might even be liable for reparation costs under international law . 
  even better , the uk has using this convention in the past against other countries who broke treaties !, 
  the wto also has clauses against breaking trade treaties , which could also apply , although that might be more of a stretch . 
   realistically in the case of the uk and eu , would it be the same hit ? 
  the eu has started claiming absurd numbers and drawing up bills to leave ( which - importantly - are n't legislated for anywhere in the treaties ) . 
  that 's not going to happen in any other trade deal and most countries would probably agree that in the uk 's position , they 'd do something similar . 
  the bills are n't in the treaties ( though a lot of them fall under `` member state obligations '' which are ) , but there is official documentation ( including passed uk budgets ) and agreements where the uk bindingly states it is committing to those things . 
  also , the bills are n't absurd , and includes liabilities for eu loans shared by the uk , eu pensions which the uk is legally required to contribute to , etc. 
  many of them are contigent and will probably not be paid ( the news are only focusing on the `` worst case '' as it makes a better headline ) . 
  if you are curious about details [ here ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/pb_barker_brexit_bill_3feb17.pdf ) is a more detailed white paper on the brexit bill done by a uk thinktank with slight pro-brexit leanings ( although they 're relatively neutral ) , and even they came up with at least 14.5 # bn as a fair bill , and that assumes a deal where the uk forsakes the rebate , while it is still a member of the eu ( and as such is paying into it ) . 
  also , it also assumes the uk will continue to contribute to the liabilities of existing loans to member states by the eu , if they are ever required ( i.e. 
  a member state defaults ) . 
  put together , this would cover over half of the `` ridiculous '' bill the eu proposes . 
  anyways , technically it does n't matter how `` unfair '' or `` ridiculous '' they are , as long as it can be proven the uk agreed to them in the past and that article 56 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties does not allow for revocation . 
   first it does n't specify whether or not `` taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union '' can happen in parallel with the `` setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal '' or if one has to happen first . 
  it 's eu members who ( allegedly ) will refuse to do the former until the latter is complete . 
  no treaties broken here . 
  not saying otherwise , but it is understandable that the eu wants the `` ugly '' things settled first , especially considering that it has the upper hand in negotiations due to the huge size of the internal market . 
   second , `` any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements '' is all that 's required to leave . 
  no agreement after two years is following the treaty ( '' ... or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 '' ) . 
  even if the uk refuses to negotiate anything for those two years , it has followed the treaty to the word.no treaties broken here . 
  anyways , my point is that if there is a deal , then that deal will fall under ecj 's jurisdiction * because * it is signed as part of the article 50 process , which by signing the lisbon treaty ( which superseded past eu treaties , so those do n't matter a single bit for this discussion ) the uk has agreed is the only way of leaving the eu . 
  however , even if there is no deal after 2 years , there are still commitments made by the uk as a state to the eu institution , which need to be dealt with as they do not depend on the uk 's continued membership . 
  in particular , the $ 60 billion covers britain 's potential obligations in three main areas : legally binding budget commitments that will be paid after britain leaves ; pension promises to eu officials ; and contingent liabilities -- such as bailout loans to ireland -- that would only require payments in certain circumstances . 
  of course the exact details will be part of the negotiations , and the 60 $ bn are just the worst case scenario ( and of course the eu will start negotiating from the top , while the uk will negotiate from the bottom - in the end they will meet in the middle ) . 
   remember that many of these are for single market membership though . 
  things like funds for ee are at least partially a payment for being in the single market ( hence norway having to pay many of them ) . 
  it will very much be a negotiating point between the two sides . 
  the uk is `` required '' to pay these funds ( legally or morally ) , but may in return for a beneficial deal . 
  requiring the uk to give things up with no guarantee is ( in my opinion ) an amazing way to achieve no agreement at all . 
  i would even support the government ( as a non-tory , remain voter ) unilaterally leaving the eu if it continues to become clear that the commission is going to refuse to negotiate without us signing up to things beforehand . 
  yes , but the commitments exist , so they need to be settled by mutual agreement . 
  not settling them is the same as going back on your word , which is not a good idea if uk 's whole strategy post-brexit relies on people wanting to sign treaties with you as fast as possible . 
   all trade deals can be unilaterally stopped . 
  trump would n't be reneging on anything if he ended nafta tomorrow . 
  it has always been possible to unilaterally leave the eu without reneging on anything . 
  article 56 of the [ vienna convention on the law of treaties ] ( https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf ) ( which the uk is party to ) :  article 56 . 
  denunciation of or withdrawal from a treaty containing no provision regarding termination , denunciation or withdrawal  * 1 . 
  a treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which does not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless :  ( a ) it is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal ; or  ( b ) a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty . 
  a party shall give not less than twelve months ' notice of its intention to denounce or withdraw from a treaty under paragraph tl ; dr : in international law you are not allowed to leave treaties willy-nilly unless the treaty explicitly allows you to ( or there is mutual agreement ) . 
  not doing so can ( and has in the past ) result in court cases in the international court of justice as well as the wto ( for trade treaties between party states ) , and lead to sanctions and/or reparations . 
  either way , it implies a huge loss of trust in the diplomatic community . 
  [ as for nafta , it does contain clauses regarding withdrawal , more specifically article 2205  ( http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/chap-22.asp )  article 2205 : withdrawal  a party may withdraw from this agreement six months after it provides written notice of withdrawal to the other parties . 
  if a party withdraws , the agreement shall remain in force for the remaining parties . 
  so yes , trump can cancel nafta with 6 months notice , without breaking the treaty . 
  otherwise , he is reneging on its terms . 
  of course , the us is sovereign and could just legislate it away , but again it would imply a huge hit on the diplomatic stage and nobody would trust the us 's word ever again . 
  but the uk has committed to leaving through the article 50 when they signed the lisbon treaty , which either means no deal ( which by lisbon treaty rules is equivalent to wto ) , or a deal where the uk commits to payments . 
  the article 50 process falls under the jurisdiction of the ecj , which means the deal will also be signed under its jurisdiction ( and i would n't doubt it will contain something saying exactly this , just to make sure ) . 
  of course , the uk is sovereign and could ( even today ) decide that it does n't care about the ecj or the article 50 procedure .
