  that would be the same as unilaterally breaking the lisbon treaty , though ( and probably many other treaties , many also include provisions which bind the uk to the ecj 's and/or the echr 's jurisdiction , i.e. 
  the good friday agreement ) . 
  if you do n't understand how unilaterally reneging a treaty you voluntarily signed is against international law and makes other countries trust you less , i 'm not sure what to say . 
  it is not only a huge diplomatic hit , but it also announces to the world that you might not keep your word with them either , increasing the risk inherent to them signing any kind of deal with you considerably . 
  i do however agree partially with the rest of your comment , if the uk made financial commitments until 2020 and is keeping them ( from your example , galileo ) , then it should get the benefits of those commitments until at least 2020 as well , and i am sure this will be part of the negotiations . 
  after 2020 , however , it depends on the rest of the deal ( and keeping access to those benefits will most likely require payments to continue ) . 
  although , not all those investments have clear benefits . 
  for example , eu financial commitments for pensions for eu workers who served during the time the uk was a member do not bring any `` benefit '' , but the uk made those commitments so they will have to come to an agreement with the eu on how to cover them . 
  but the thing is that any article 50 deal will be signed ** under the ecj 's jurisdiction ** . 
  abolishing an international treaty is not retroactive , leaving the eu does not mean that the process of leaving the eu does not have to follow eu law . 
  the uk signed the lisbon treaty and thus the article 50 procedure , agreeing to exactly that . 
  of course , the uk is sovereign ( yes , even inside the eu ) and could declare that they do not care about the ecj and/or whatever article 50 deal is negotiated ( if any ) . 
  however , if the uk unilaterally reneges on existing commitments/obligations to the eu , you will have a seriously hard time finding any trade partners in the future . 
  no country wants trade agreements with countries who have shown they do n't keep their promises , except maybe at very very beneficial ( to them , not to the uk ) conditions . 
  now , exactly how much the bill will be is up for negotiation , but you can not seriously say that the uk has no commitments that will require payment , if so you are delusional . 
   and that 's just what they did : through the ecb , they took action to force greece 's banks to close , ultimately driving the greek government -- against its democratic mandate -- to accept the country 's third ` bailout ' , together with new austerity measures and new reductions in national sovereignty . 
  as much as i support diem and this initiative ( i 'm all for more transparency in eu institutions ) , this is not what i remember happening . 
  the ecb did not force greece to close its banks . 
  the ecb has no power to force greece to close its banks , actually . 
  what happened was that after the deal collapsed , the ecb voted to stop increasing ela ( `` emergency liquidity assistance '' ) which are basically loans directly from the ecb to the greek central bank , meant to stave off temporary liquidity emergencies in the banking system . 
  these were well above what they were ever supposed to be ( 89bn $ ) and increases were passed daily , as a bank run started in greece when the negotiations seemed to be over . 
  these `` emergency '' measures were starting to look permanent , so the ecb voted to stop increasing them . 
  one could say that the ecb 's decision is what indirectly led to the greek central bank having the liquidity issue that forced them to close the banks ( and maybe even argue that they should have extended it further ) , but it 's a pure fabrication to say that the ecb forced greece to close the banks . 
  the economic conditions in greece , including bank run during the period after syriza winning the elections and especially when the negotiations stalled right before the referendum were no fault of the ecb . 
  instead , they were the combined result of political choices by greece ( both by the syriza government and over the previous decades ) , together with the conservative-majority power dynamics in the eurozone at the time ( which , although weakened , still survives to this day ) , that made it obvious to anyone who was not deluded that the only two possible ways out of the crisis would be austerity or drachma . 
  those people and businesses of course chose to withdraw their money in euros , instead of having it converted into worthless drachmas , and i do n't blame them as i would have too in the same situation . 
  the fact that this initiative 's `` background '' section so clearly manipulates the truth to make the ecb look bad makes me sad , an initiative that would otherwise have the moral high-ground . 
  [ see this article in the economist from back then ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/referendum-and-greek-banks ) edit : even their background document agrees with my position :  ** on june 28 the ecb governing council refused greece 's central bank the right to increase its ela facility ** , effectively closing greece 's banks down at enormous cost to greek business , citizens and greece 's image . 
  this states that the ecb not increasing their ela facility was the ecb forcing their banks to close , which is quite a stretch , and completely different from what they state in the campaign summary . 
  ps : `` right to increase its ela facility '' is a very propaganda-ish way of putting it . 
  sadly , the ecb is not the lender of last resort , which means that elas are ** not ** a right , and rely on a majority decision by the ecb council of governors . 
  relying on them should be a measure of last resort , and they may be cut off at any time . 
  ---------------------- note : i agree that the ecb 's decision to stop increasing ela was hasty . 
  however , the way the negotiations were going , it was looking increasingly likely that greece would leave the euro . 
  the ecb ( again , sadly not a lender of last resort ) is not allowed by its rules to lend infinite money to one specific central bank ( in this case , through ela ) if it does not find it credible that it is going to get it back , with the decision up to the council of governors . 
  of course , a country leaving the euro on bad terms saddled with a ton of debt would certainly qualify . 
  it could even be said ( and i distinctly remember reading economist opinions back then with similar thoughts ) that the ecb did not have a mandate to increase the ela as far as it did . 
  in the end , i support this initiative as i think the ecb should not be allowed to keep this legal opinion secret , but the organization 's obvious attempt at propaganda and fact manipulation leaves a very sour taste in my mouth . 
  on a related note , i would support a campaign to change the ecb into a lender of last resort , but i am realistic and know that for there to even be a small chance of everyone agreeing , it 'd need a fiscal union to support it . 
  greece 's marathon crisis is at least instructive . 
  past flare-ups have illustrated a textbook 's worth of economic principles . 
  the latest episode -- a dispute over the sustainability of greece 's mammoth debt -- provides a lesson in political economy . 
  the beleaguered economy itself is not at the centre of the disagreement ; rather it is the european commission and the imf and others that are at loggerheads , squabbling over projections of greek growth . 
  this sort of institutional wrangling is not incidental to the process of european integration ; it has historically been a crucial ingredient , helping defang the continent 's tricky interstate relations . 
  but as greece 's latest turn in the spotlight demonstrates , the role of europe 's institutions has changed during the euro-area crisis . 
  paradoxically , they themselves have become part of the existential threat facing the european project . 
  like european identity itself , the role of `` institutions '' can seem vague , amorphous and of overstated importance . 
  yet institution-building has been one of the most consequential aspects of european integration . 
  economists view institutions as the solutions to social problems beyond the scope of markets and the state . 
  europe 's supranational bodies are not simply talking-shops or bloated bureaucracies . 
  they are entities apart from the eu 's members , and come to develop their own identity and culture . 
  that the term `` brussels '' is thrown around in national capitals as a catch-all for the pesky creature that is eu authority is a design feature , not a bug . 
  old enmities between european neighbours hinder co-operation . 
  even when the topic under discussion offers mutual gain , the spectre of , say , french leaders making concessions to germans can so repel french voters as to scupper deals . 
  bowing to europe 's supranational institutions is less painful . 
  so brussels has proved useful in domestic policy battles . 
  in countries where politics long thwarted efforts to rein in inflation , put budgets on a sustainable course or liberalise the economy , eu membership altered the political dynamic : tough decisions could be blamed on the hard taskmasters in brussels . 
  and for countries looking to join the eu , the benefits of membership made unpalatable domestic reforms easier to swallow . 
  perhaps most important , the architects of european integration counted on the institutions they were creating to defuse the danger posed when vacuums of power led to crisis . 
  as jean monnet , a french official and a founding father of the european project , put it , `` europe will be forged in crises , and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises . '' in the past , states at odds with each other might use diplomatic or military pressure to settle an argument . 
  but in post-war europe self-interested eurocrats in brussels would charge into power vacuums to assert their new authority . 
  european institutions were a mechanism through which european infighting could be turned to state building . 
  these old patterns , however , have broken down during the drawn-out euro-area crisis . 
  the locus of decision-taking , argue markus brunnermeier , harold james and jean-pierre landau in `` the euro and the battle of ideas '' , a book published last year , has moved : from brussels to national capitals ; then to berlin and paris ; and finally to berlin alone . 
  when the crisis erupted in 2010 it was soon clear that meetings of heads of government or finance ministers mattered more than what the commission or parliamentarians said . 
  early on , germany and france decided to reach their own consensus before eu meetings . 
  it would prevail , focusing power in berlin and paris . 
  as german economic performance and political continuity diverged from france , the duet became a solo . 
  this dynamic brought back the sting to negotiations within europe , along with old chestnuts about northern heartlessness and southern profligacy , eroding an already thin sense of european solidarity . 
  in peripheral economies , the battle lines are clear enough ; greeks see themselves as bowing to angela merkel , germany 's chancellor , rather than to faceless eurocrats . 
  eu national governments argue , with reason , that policies imposed by europe did more harm than good : that , for instance , without an independent monetary policy or a currency to devalue , austerity is counterproductive . 
  brussels has graduated from convenient scapegoat to the imf 's bogeyman enforcer . 
  mainstream parties used to diverting blame to brussels find themselves challenged by radical parties desiring to escape it . 
  critically , instead of expanding in an attempt to limit the damage , as monnet would have hoped , the authority of brussels has been checked . 
  the crucial decision to involve the imf in euro-area programmes was partly based on a need to get around the maastricht treaty 's `` no bail-out '' strictures . 
  but it was also rooted in a mistrust of eu institutions . 
  member states , and especially germany , reckoned the imf could impose conditions on indebted countries more credibly than the european commission . 
  a proposal to create a new institution , the european monetary fund , was rejected . 
  the european central bank is the exception among eu institutions ; its power has grown massively in the course of the crisis . 
  but as the least accountable of the european institutions , its expanded authority does more to undermine the legitimacy of the european project than to reinforce it . 
  ** blue angela ** had the eu a longer history before it faced this existential crisis , enough power might have shifted to brussels to make a more centralised response inevitable . 
  but there is also an irony in the way the crisis has unfolded . 
  no leader has worked harder to hold europe together than mrs merkel . 
  and yet the forcefulness of german leadership , and its decision to trust the imf over the institutions in brussels , have shaken europe 's delicate political economy . 
  strange to relate , europe 's unhappiness with brussels may stem not from too much eurocracy , but too little . 
  i actually made a mistake as well , only resolution 1 passed with a larger majority than 3 , 
   approved by a 48 % majority , sounds like it split parliamentary opinion . 
  note that that is resolution 3 . 
  resolution 1 passed with a larger majority . 
  edit : resolution 2 actually passed with a smaller majority than 3, 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the parliament approved 3 resolutions detailing its vision for the future of the eu . 
  first resolution ( mercedes bresso ( s&d , it ) ; elmar brok ( epp , de ) ) approved by 329 votes to 223 with 83 abstentions : * the council of ministers should be turned into a genuine second legislative chamber , and its configurations into preparatory bodies similar to parliament 's committees . 
  * each member state should present at least three candidates , including both genders , for the role of `` its '' commissioner . 
  * the council should switch completely to qualified majority voting , wherever this is possible under the treaties , to avoid blocking important draft laws and speed up the legislative process . 
  * a permanent council of defence ministers should be set up to coordinate the member states ' defence policies . 
  second resolution ( guy verhofstadt ( alde , be ) ) approved by 283 votes to 269 with 83 abstentions : * suggest creating an eu finance minister and giving the eu commission the power to formulate and give effect to a common eu economic policy , backed up by a euro-area budget . 
  * reiterate that the european parliament should have a single seat . 
  * propose reducing the size of the college of eu commissioners substantially , including by cutting the number of vice-presidents to two . 
  * state their belief in allowing eu citizens in each member state to vote directly on the european political parties ' lead candidates for commission president . 
  third resolution ( reimer b\u00f6ge ( epp , de ) and pervenche ber\u00e8s ( s&d , fr ) ) approved by 304 votes to 255 with 68 abstentions : * a fiscal capacity consisting of the european stability mechanism ( esm ) and specific additional budgetary capacity for the euro area , funded by its members as a part of the eu budget .
