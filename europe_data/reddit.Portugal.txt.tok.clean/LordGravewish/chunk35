  * a european monetary fund ( which should gradually develop out of the esm ) with adequate lending and borrowing capacities and a clearly-defined mandate to absorb economic shocks . 
  * a convergence code : five years to meet convergence criteria on taxation , labour market , investment , productivity , and social cohesion . 
  * governance : a bigger role for the european parliament and national parliaments , merging the functions of eurogroup president and economic and monetary affairs commissioner , plus a finance minister and treasury within the european commission . 
  yes , that 's right . 
  now ask yourself why someone saying `` gracias '' when thanking a portuguese person could be more subtle ( and annoying ) than directly saying we are a part of spain , 
  in most semi-presidential states , the parliament has no power over the president . 
  the president can dissolve the government and/or the parliament . 
  if the parliament does n't like the president , they ca n't do shit . 
  i assume romania is like this as well ? 
  this effectively means that non-targeted data retention laws are illegal under eu law and subject to a blanket ban . 
  considering the last few months , i would never have expected such a ruling . 
  thank you for the early christmas gift !, 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2016/12/eu-supreme-court-rules-data-retention-die-die-die/ ) these laws are now effectively banned , so no longer have any legal weight . 
  sure , the parliament can not veto a country leaving through article 50 . 
  however , it does absolutely have veto power on any deal that comes out of the article 50 negotiations ( the same way it can veto any normal trade deal ) , which means it can single-handedly force a `` hard brexit '' ( i.e brexit with no deal of any kind , not even a transitional deal ) . 
  in addition , any single member state can also veto the whole deal . 
  sure , assuming that all member state governments agree with the deal ( which would already be quite the achievement ) , it is arguable if the parliament would manage to assemble a majority to veto it while being pressured not to do so . 
  nevertheless , the possibility of a veto does give the parliament some very real leverage in the negotiations . 
  for example , most if not all of their recommendations were incorporated into the eu 's official negotiation stance , including those to do with citizen 's rights . 
  there is the [ european forest fire information service ( effis ) ] ( http://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ) , part of the commission 's emergency management service , which already does a lot of those things , and coordinates the wildfire response of all eu member states ( for example , the airplanes sent by france/italy are being coordinated under the commission ) . 
  however , the eu 's civil protection service requires a request for assistance from the affected member state before anything can be done at eu level , and the portuguese government only submitted the request for assistance this morning . 
  yes , because those countries ( i assume you mean ireland and the uk ) negotiated opt-outs in the treaties themselves ( the uk is n't even part of schengen ) , which everyone else agreed to ... feel free to renegotiate the treaties to get the opt-outs granted to you as well , but remember treaty changes need unanimity . 
  otherwise , either follow the decision , find a majority to overrule it , or say `` screw this '' and activate article 50 . 
  ignoring the decisions opens you up to sanctions ( which can include the suspension of voting rights ) . 
  yes , that is in the treaties ( tfeu 7 's sanctioning mechanism , which allows the council to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the eu country in breach of them ) . 
   and without a full consensus in the eu bodies , that includes the council , there is no legally binding legislature on this . 
  oh , but there is !, 
  since lisbon , a treaty which all countries agreed to and ratified , immigration only requires qualified majority voting in the council ( 79 tfeu ) the migrant quotas [ passed in the eu council ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-proposal-for-a-council-decision-establishing-provisional-measures-in-the-area-of-international-prote.html ) and [ in the eu parliament ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-council-decision-establishing-provisional-measures-in-the-area-of-international-protection-for-the-b-9.html ) . 
  as such , there is by all definitions a consensus in the eu institutions . 
  maybe not a unanimous consensus , but a consensus nevertheless , one which the treaties give legal weight . 
  which means that * every * eu country is obligated to either follow these decisions , find a majority in the eu to overrule them , * or start the process to leave the eu * . 
  not doing either opens those countries up to sanctions , according to the treaties they agreed to . 
  does not matter if you disagree with the decisions ( i disagree as well ) , but all countries agreed to these rules , so they need to follow them . 
  cherry-picking is * not * allowed by the treaties !, 
  to be fair , if you want co2 neutral technologies , fusion is n't really necessary medium-term . 
  a mix of nuclear ( fission ) and renewables would solve most of those issues right now . 
  i 'm still dumbfounded how nuclear became so `` anti-environmentalist '' , and i think it 's one of the greatest mistakes of the `` green '' movement , something that will cost us dearly in the long run . 
  i do n't see any other way out of our current predicament ( barring any huge advances in fusion ) than replacing all fossil fuel production with any co2 neutral source we can find , including nuclear , as fast as possible . 
  as technology improves gradually replace nuclear with renewables ( and fusion , if/once it becomes available ) . 
  even in a worst case with a dozen nuclear accidents ( which newer plant designs have basically eliminated ) we would still be in a considerably better situation vs the current alternative ( even assuming every country follows their paris pledges to the letter ) . 
  afair the lisbon treaty explicitly lists taxation policies as requiring unanimity . 
  on my phone right now so ca n't confirm , but i am convinced what you 're saying is incorrect . 
  anyways , even if it did not require majority ( and i can almost guarantee it does ) , it would still need 50 % of the euparl and then qmv in the council . 
  you can find it here : https://stateoftheunion.eui.eu/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7346&amp;v=ta0n00wu-y0, 
  running a currency is a completely different beast than a running commercial bank , subject to different market pressures and regulations . 
  `` central banks '' have barely anything in common with commercial banks . 
  that you think differently shows your complete lack of understanding of what a currency actually is . 
  why would taxpayers from country a wish to shore up country b 's banks if they have no influence in that country ? 
  what would happen if country a followed economic and tax policies which were incompatible with the policies of the rest of the currency union , in detriment to the rest of the currency union ? 
  just two simple , clear examples of why at least a partial political union is necessary to create an optimum currency zone , but there are many many more . 
  these questions are already hugely debated in the current eurozone , a currency union in the eec would have quickly collapsed . 
  [ hell , you do n't even need to take my word for it , they actually tried . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday ), 
  good luck keeping a single currency without any type of political integration . 
  it 's hard enough as it is since we do n't have a lot of the requirements for an [ optimum currency area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) , let 's make it even worse !, 
  i 'm sure that 'll work perfectly . 
  those are not a projection , those are the current count results , considerably different . 
  only hamon ( at 6 % ) conceded so far , afaik . 
  which is good to hear , as those same polls give macron the 2nd round win with over 20 % advantage . 
  [ macron has a huge advantage right now ( 20 % + ) ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/04/daily-chart-5 ) hopefully it holds . 
  it 's a somewhat complex topic in my opinion ... 
  although i 've always lived in portugal i would n't say i 'm `` portuguese first '' . 
  just because someone was born on the other side of the earth is not a reason for me to consider myself somehow different from them . 
  i have plenty of experience with other european cultures . 
  other than portuguese , i can speak english , german and french . 
  i 've got real life friends from germany , england and scotland i keep in regular contact with . 
  my sister studies in italy ... culturally , given the choice between `` portugal '' and `` europe '' , i would just say i identify with `` both '' . 
  i wish i could say `` earth '' too , but i sincerely can not identify with some cultures - religious and/or tyrannical cultures common around the world . 
  i do believe tough , that they ( and us ! ), 
  could improve if given the chance . 
  this reminded me of part of john lennon 's `` imagine '' ... 
  i hope we as a species can achieve this in the future - but from what i 've seen in my time here , if we do , it 's not coming any time soon . 
   imagine there 's no countries  it is n't hard to do  nothing to kill or die for  and no religion too  imagine all the people living life in peace, 
  well , with all the legal confusion caused by the uk veto , you 'll probably find that they can not change that with only a 26-level treaty ... 
  well , you do understand i do n't live in hungary , and we have our own problems over here in portugal , so it 's kind of natural i had n't heard that it was this serious before . 
  but of course , it does happen . 
  this article kind of reminded me of the fall of the weimar republic for some reason . 
  first time i 've heard of this - and it just seems too horrendous not to be sensationalistic ... can anyone more in the know confirm that this is actually happening ? 
  if so everyone in hungary should be out on the streets protesting against this !, 
  hell , i 'd help you guys out if i could . 
  `` public enemy '' ) is a satirical portuguese publication in the veins of `` the onion '' or similar things . 
  i enjoyed this week 's cover and thought some of you guys might be interested in seeing it . 
  [ direct link to the cover ] ( http://ia.n.sl.pt/01/images/1/11/6286_11ef271b8295679726d31223e4a44c55.png ) [ link to the whole issue , if you want to read more ] ( http://jornais.sapo.pt/nacional/6286 ) obviously , it 's written in portuguese . 
  to help you guys understand it , i did a quick and dirty translation of the cover . 
  i added some extra details between ' [ ' and ' ] ' to help others understand the jokes better . 
  [ i also translated three other articles in a comment , if you 're interested . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c157e/cover_of_this_weeks_issue_of_inimigo_p%c3%bablico_a/csrcpqv )  ## plan b is a go  #portugal hires authors of 100 trillion zimbabwe dollar bills  the government already has an alternative for the euro and therefore faces with less stress the moment when jeroen dijsselbloem shows portugal the door of the eurozone . 
  the bank of portugal was ordered to hire the zimbabwean financial team who issued the 100.000.000.000.000 local zimbabwean dollars bills . 
   in portugal , the exchange rate will be one euro-cent ( 0.01 $ ) to 100.000.000.000.000 cavacos [ the name of the current portuguese president of the republic ] , the new national currency , or 500.000.000.000.000 massam\u00e1s , if passos 's village goes through with its threat of secession . 
  [ passos coelho is the current prime minister , and he lives in a village called massam\u00e1 ]  a complex study by bag\u00e3o f\u00e9lix [ finance minister between 2004 and 2005 ] , done in 20 seconds on the back of a parking meter bill , came to the conclusion that a portuguese citizen will need 100.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 cavacos to buy a single medlar fruit . 
  equally , 80 million gigabytes would be needed to convert william carvalho 's contract value into cavacos . 
  [ william carvalho is a very well-paid soccer player ]  #portugal leaves the euro , goes back to the * escudo * , and changes name to `` europe southern bay ''  this greece thing is really about to blow up on our hands , and we need to move forward without any drama . 
  after the re-branding of almada , seixal and barreiro [ cities south of lisbon , in the southern coast of the tagus river , part of the `` greater lisbon '' area ] into `` lisbon south bay '' , portugal is going to transform a whole territory with an awful reputation into a modern , refreshing and attractive name . 
   `` a country without ` portugal ' in the name is a chance to start from scratch . 
  it feels liberating . 
  maybe this way we 'll be able to make something out of it . '', 
  meanwhile , tsipras loved this idea and is planning to change greece 's name into `` europe southeast bay '' . 
   #portugal , greece and puerto rico study a common currency  with a very fragile economic situation , as well as many complex financial problems left to solve , portugal , greece and puerto rico decided to unite over these difficulties and will create a new currency . 
  the ` coiso ' [ lit . 
  ` thing ' ] will be a currency better adapted to the economic and development model of the respective countries , with fairer and more balanced fiscal rules , without all the arrogance of the great powers of the euro and the dollar .
