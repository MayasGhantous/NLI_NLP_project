  and a very important paragraph from the conclusion :  * the alternatives to eu membership are unsatisfactory * : they either give britain ** less control over regulation ** than it currently enjoys , * or * they offer ** more control but less market access ** . 
  this report was made by the center for european reform ( a british think-tank ) , under partnership with [ bt ] ( http://home.bt.com/ ) , [ thecityuk ] ( http://www.thecityuk.com/ ) , [ diageo ] ( http://www.diageo.com/ ) and [ ibm ] ( http://www.ibm.com/ ) . 
  it 's hard to say that it 's biased , as 3 out of those are british companies/bodies , and ibm is american ( the eu did n't even go so far as * touching * this report ) , but i 'd love to see you guys try . 
  i just bookmarked this to post anytime i see someone use these exact same arguments to justify wanting to leave the eu ^ ( ssr ) . 
  it depends on the number of jobs available . 
  if there is a country with need of doctors/engineers , like germany , then the price was actually `` too much '' to begin with - and that 's not healthy for anyone ( including the workers who earn `` too much '' , as their companies are n't competitive like that ) . 
  if the countries did not have an excess of jobs , then people would n't be moving there anyways . 
  also , it would n't be `` too much '' in hungary because they started out with `` too low '' , not `` normal '' . 
  there is a lack of qualified workers in countries like germany . 
  they come to my university to recruit engineers even before we finish the course , at german wage levels ( we 're not just `` cheaper labour '' ) . 
  hopefully me too , someday , as there is n't much work over here . 
  why do you think they do that ? 
  also , engineering unemployment rates in germany actually keep going down . 
  everybody 's happy - the companies ( who have access to workers they desperately need , at non-inflated prices , which is necessary in order to be competitive ) , and the workers ( who are more easily able to find jobs with reasonable wages ) !, 
  so wages equalize . 
  was n't that the goal ? 
  also , those countries need workers , so it 's not like those 150 people are only competing for 100 jobs . 
  the system that the parties agreed on is similar to many national parliamentary systems - to elect a government , you need a majority in the parliament . 
  the winning party in those systems is only the one who gets first go at an attempt to a deal , they are n't necessarily the party who is going to form and lead the government ( although it 's almost always the case ) . 
  these systems make sense , as without such a coalition/deal , the government would probably find it difficult to ever get anything done . 
  this of course does n't apply to the euparl , but they are trying to turn the euparl ( and the eu itself ) into a parliamentary democracy and this could be the first step . 
  the lisbon treaty allows this , and if it succeeds i would expect them to attempt to insert further parliamentary powers into the next treaty ( whenever that is , if ever ) . 
  so yeah , the parties need to form a majority-holding coalition/deal in order to elect a candidate as the commission president . 
  according to the latest projection : epp + alde + ecr = 323 meps s&d + greens/efa + gue/ngl = 285 meps a majority needs ceil ( 751/2 ) = 376 meps neither the left nor the right has a majority ( although the right has a lead ) - unaffiliated meps ( ni + others = 107 ) will likely be the king-makers . 
  i did n't count the efd because it 's unlikely they 'll be part of any deal . 
  [ new ( 23:39 cest ) european-wide projection is out that is based on the official results so far . 
  ] ( http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/election-results-2014.html ) one more candidate for the epp , but the s&d lost quite a few compared to the previous projection . 
  many more unknown candidates who will probably end up being the king-makers . 
  ^ ( the numbers between parenthesis are the numbers from the 1st projection an hour or so ago . ), 
  epp : 212 ( from 211 ) s&d : 185 ( from 193 ) alde : 71 ( from 74 ) greens/efa : 55 ( from 58 ) gue/ngl : 45 ( from 47 ) ni ( not attached ) : 40 ( no change ) ecr : 40 ( from 39 ) efd : 36 ( from 33 ) others ( unknown affiliation ) : 67 ( from 56 ), 
  according to guy verhofstadt , alde is in negotiation with new parties that might give them 16 more seats from the `` others '' section . 
  this could mean that alde and greens could have enough seats to give one of both main parties ( epp or s&d ) the majority . 
  [ the first european-wide projections are out . 
  ] ( http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/election-results-2014.html ) epp wins with 211 meps , versus 193 for the s&d . epp : 211 s&d : 193 alde : 74 greens/efa : 58 gue/ngl : 47 ni ( not attached ) : 40 ecr : 39 efd : 33 others ( unknown affiliation ) : 56, 
  ** portugal ** ( exit polls ) : ps ( pes ) : 30 % to 34 % - elects 7 to 9 meps ( had 7 ) alian\u00e7a portugal ( epp ) : 25 % to 29 % - elects 6 to 8 meps ( had 8 ) cdu ( gue/ngl ) : 12 % to 15 % - elects 3 to 4 meps ( had 2 ) mpt ( unknown ) : 7 % to 8 % - elects 1 to 2 meps ( no mep currently ) be ( pel ) : 5 % to 7 % - elects 1 to 2 meps ( had 3 ) cdu and be want to leave the euro to be able to devaluate the currency , but they want to stay in the eu . 
  the rest are all pro-eu . 
  mpt ( `` party of the earth '' ) has said that leaving the euro or/and the eu is something nobody in their right mind would support . 
  they 're also in favor of further integration , and campaign against corruption . 
  ^ ( ironically , their head candidate is known by many to be quite corrupt . ), 
  it 's likely ( though not certain ) , since those fringe parties usually manage to get their voters to actually vote much easier than the mainstream parties . 
  during the eu elections fringe parties are usually over-represented because of that . 
  npd is kind of worrying . 
  this is a perfect example of what happens when many people do n't vote ( 47 % turnout ) - fringe parties like the neo-nazis get seats ... 
  the official page from the euparl : http://electionsnight2014.eu/, 
   put them side by side and there 's basically no difference except a few word and sentences here and there . 
  wait , did you actually do this , or are you just reporting hear-say ? 
  seriously . 
  go do what you said . 
  even without going into the content , one of them lists * ammendments * to previous treaties , while the other one is a real constitution that completely scraps previous treaties . 
  feel free to discuss how the contents might have similarities , but what you said ( `` there 's basically no difference except a few word and sentences here and there '' ) is completely wrong . 
  also , after reading through the ammendments for the first article in the treaty of lisbon and the first article of the constitution , there are more differences than i can count . 
  and they 're not just `` a word or two '' , they 're actually huge differences - for example :  under the principle of conferral , the union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the member states in the treaties to attain the objectives set out therein . 
  competences not conferred upon the union in the treaties remain with the member states . 
  this whole part is missing from the constitution . 
  more examples abound . 
  i 'm not saying i agree ( or not ) with the lisbon treaty and how it was passed - please do n't just spout exaggerated anti-eu non-sense without grounds . 
  since when do tariffs mean that no trade occurs ? 
  how could a country outside any free trade agreement with another be allowed to trade completely tariff-free , it 's completely ridiculous !, 
  also , i say again : it would be suicide for the eu to let a country leave ( both the eu and the efta/eea ) without raising any tariffs . 
  if leaving has no downside ( leaving the common market , for one - a main reason to be in the eu * is * the common market ) then half the eu would leave . 
  the common market only works because everyone is either in the eu , or the efta/eea . 
  to leave both without leaving the common market ( tariff-free trade ) means exactly that : * having your cake and eating it , too * . 
   tariffs are not in anyone 's interests . 
  if the uk leaves the eu , they 're in the eu 's interest . 
  the uk does not export anything to the eu that is important enough ( or can not be gotten elsewhere inside the eu at competitive prices ) for the eu to ever consider not applying tariffs . 
  also , it would be political suicide for the eu as an institution to let the uk leave without a tariffs increase , or without it joining the efta/eea . 
  keep in mind that the uk joining the efta/eea , would mean that , similarly to norway , you 'd have to apply all those regulations you so despise * nationally * , without having a say in their making . 
  you ca n't have your cake ( leave the eu ) and eat it ( without tariffs ) , too . 
  because the eu parliament is an european-wide institution , so eu citizens have european-wide voting rights ... that 's like saying that scots should n't be able to vote in london , if they live there . 
  with the lisbon treaty , the euparl should ( i hope ) be the one electing the head of the commission . 
  if you do n't go and vote , you 're just telling the council ( who pick the prime minister candidates to present to the parliament for a vote , fulfilling the same role as the head of state in many other parliamentary democracies like the uk ) that you do n't want the euparl to exist and/or have that power , as you 're robbing the euparl of any democratic legitimacy it is using to slowly grab more powers . 
  since the euparl can veto * almost * anything ( except some rare special legislative procedures like a new eu treaty ) , the commission also ca n't ignore the euparl if they want . 
  [ if that were to happen  ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/ldm_bri%282013%29130619_rev2_en.pdf )  parliament could lodge an action for failure to act pursuant to article 265 tfeu with the court of justice of the eu if the commission failed to take any action upon a parliament 's request . 
  they could also threaten to veto everything the commission does until they actually took action , altough the court of justice would probably prove more effective . 
  of course . 
  the eussr is an anti-democratic bureaucratic mess , there 's no way a treaty ( and before that , the attempt at a constitution ) that tries to at least partially fix a few things could be anything good . 
  * huh , you 're asking what i specifically dislike about the treaties since it seems i know so much about them ? 
  ummm ... 
  they 're ... 
  anti-democratic . . ? . . 
  as much as i agree that the euparl should have legislative initiative , it 's not * that * big of a deal . 
  especially with the lisbon treaty , the parliament has a lot of power . 
   therefore , while parliament can amend and reject legislation , to make a proposal for legislation , it needs the commission to draft a bill before anything can become law . 
  [ 45 ] the value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85 % of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law . 
  [ 46 ] yet it has been argued by former parliament president hans-gert p\u00f6ttering that as ** the parliament does have the right to ask the commission to draft such legislation ** , and as the commission is following parliament 's proposals more and more ** parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative ** . 
  [ 9 ]  the parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence , through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings , as a `` pan-european soapbox '' with the ear of thousands of brussels-based journalists . 
  there is also an indirect effect on foreign policy ; ** the parliament must approve all development grants ** , including those overseas . 
  for example , the support for post-war iraq reconstruction , or incentives for the cessation of iranian nuclear development , must be supported by the parliament . 
  ** parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the united states ** . 
  [ 47 ] finally , ** parliament holds a non-binding vote on new eu treaties ** but can not veto it . 
  however when parliament threatened to vote down the nice treaty , the belgian and italian parliaments said they would veto the treaty on the european parliament 's behalf . 
  [ 48 ] [ from wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#powers_and_functions )  the lisbon treaty strengthened parliament 's initiative right by introducing the ** obligation for the commission to give reasons for any refusal to propose legislation following a request ** . 
   [ ... ]  many scholars argue therefore that ** parliament could lodge an action for failure to act pursuant to article 265 tfeu with the court of justice of the eu if the commission failed to take any action upon a parliament 's request ** . 
  [ this is an interesting briefing over the real legislative power of the eu parliament . 
  ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/ldm_bri%282013%29130619_rev2_en.pdf ) also , if their plan goes forward , the parliament will be the one actually choosing the commission president this election , so it 'll also pick the head of the sole institution with full legislative initiative . 
  is there anywhere where we can watch this recorded ? 
  quoting another comment in this thread :  why is this so controversial ? 
  he 's the epp candidate , he 's supposed to get the presidency if epp wins just as schulz is supposed to get it if s&d wins . 
  in other news , the sky is blue and water is wet . 
  funny , how the parties that regularly criticize the eu for the ` democratic deficit ' and many other issues are the ones who do n't actually want to support anything that actually fixes those complaints .
