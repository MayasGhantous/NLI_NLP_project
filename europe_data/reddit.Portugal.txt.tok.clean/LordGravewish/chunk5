  why ? 
  because they know they 'll lose ( they wo n't win the commission presidency ) , and not participating is good for populism : they can then throw their buzzwords at their constituency and continue criticizing the aforementioned ` democratic deficit ' . 
  if they thought they had any chance at winning , would n't the best way to oppose integration of the eu be to actually get their candidate elected to the commission so ythey would have * actual power to change the status quo * ? 
  do n't blame the eu for there not being any anti-eu candidate . 
  ** blame the anti-eu parties who refuse to put forward candidates ** . 
  if there are none in your country , then go ahead and create an anti-eu party yourself . 
  * it 's not the eu 's fault that there 's no sane anti-eu party in your country * ^ ( is there a sane , i.e. 
  not populist , anti-eu party anywhere , actually ? ), 
  i dislike many things about the eu , but it annoys me to no end when people blame the eu for everything that they do n't like in their life , even when the eu had * nothing to do with it * . 
  it 's raining and you got wet ? 
  well , the eu should have worked harder to make it sunny !, 
  had a car accident ? 
  if the eu did n't exist , i would n't have crashed !, 
  no political party in * my country * has the same opinions i do ? 
  ^ ( welcome to the club ! ), 
  well , those bureaucrats in the eu should come home and create national parties instead !, 
  see , europe is to blame for * everything * !, 
  / s * seriously . 
  while i agree completely with the `` 280 member states '' idea , and it probably is the way that would deliver the best and fairest federal state possible , dividing member states into those sub-states would be completely impossible today - nationalists would be up in arms . 
  i ca n't really see any way around this too , so it will have to remain a pipe dream :(, 
  not saying you 're wrong , but i seriously doubt that the top net contributors actually lose money with europe . 
  that money does n't simply disappear , you see - it ends up getting spent somewhere , likely in the same `` powerful economies '' that supplied the money . 
  it must surely come back several-fold into the countries due to exports to the huge eu market and ( though , not in the case of the uk ) due to the considerable low value of the euro compared to any country-specific currency that could be in place in those countries instead , which increases their competitiveness outside the eurozone . 
  germany is also very important for the eu . 
  should they get exceptions ? 
  what about france ? 
  just list any `` important country of the eu '' , why should n't they get the same exceptions ? 
  so , why does n't everybody just get that same exception and it 's no longer an exception ? 
  else , there 's no way you can call what you are suggesting fair . 
  giving a country an exception on anything because `` they 're important '' would just lead to half of europe asking for similar exception on other matters , because `` we 're important , too '' and `` they got theirs , why do n't we get ours ? '' . 
  sooner or later , there 'd be more exceptions than rules . 
  if the uk is allowed to stay within the eu with some sort of special status , the eu and what it stands for ( equality ) is basically over . 
  i personally believe that the uk should be stripped of it 's * current * special status , and a referendum should be offered to them , where they 'd decide whether they 're in or out . 
  then , if they stay in , they should play by the rules everyone else plays under . 
  if not , then decision making at the european level just became much easier . 
   i mean we are not talking about just any country . 
  we are talking about the country that won in the ww2 . 
  we are talking about the country where industrial revolution was born . 
  we are talking about the country that gave to the world countless inovations . 
   and we are talking about the country which is one of the powers of the world , that resist the nazi germany while everybody else capitulated . 
  you could play that game with almost any country and use similar `` arguments '' to justify almost anything . 
  you 're basically asking for some countries to be considered `` special '' compared to the rest , and given more privileges . 
  this is not what the european union is about - ** equality ** . 
  also , the uk is not ** the ** country that won the ww2 . 
  last time i checked , the usa and the soviet union also played a very large part , probably even larger . 
  but that is n't even my point - i could n't care less who was the biggest player in ww2 , that was almost a century ago . 
  i have no idea if you 're british or not , but that does n't matter - please , * stop advocating that a country is better than another * - there 's nothing special about a british person compared to any other human in the world . 
  nationalism is ** not ** a good thing , and it sickens me that it 's still common throughout europe , even after the lessons of that ww2 you 're so fond of . 
  the second debate on the 29th was much better in that regard , the candidates had more time . 
  i 've only watched about 20 minutes so far , but this debate is much better than the first one - there 's actually time to suggest real proposals and there 's actual debate between the candidates !, 
  i agree . 
  it 'd at least manage to make it so that eu elections are n't just people punishing the governing party , since the governing party would n't be competing - their members would run with the european party on the european party 's platform . 
  it 's a shame there 's no national party here aligned with alde , or i 'd really consider voting for them . 
  we only get pse and epp ( and a few other parties that did n't take part in the debate ) , and out of those two i thought schulz was the best ( though guy was better overall ) . 
  do you disagree that it is a monopoly ? 
  [ almost 90 % of market share ] ( http://etc-digital.org/digital-trends/consumer-behaviour/search-engines/regional-overview/europe/ ) * is * a monopoly . 
  now , as for regulation , that is another question , but i believe that privately-owned monopolies are never a good thing . 
  whether regulation is the answer , though , i do n't know . 
  `` democracy comes back after the break '' . 
  i laughed . 
  you also have the euronews youtube livestream [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhafgcpexes ) . 
  it 's a shame not many national broadcasters care about this debate - i guess the public prefers stupid reality shows and others awful programming instead of something that might actually matter ... 
  i was browsing [ the european citizen 's initiative web site ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing ) and saw that this initiative is currently open and collecting signatures . 
  i searched and could n't find it posted here before , so i thought i 'd share it . 
  it seems to be an interesting effort and i 'd like for it to succeed . 
  the website linked has more information , including a detailed version of the proposal [ here ] ( http://www.mediainitiative.eu/downloads/european_initiative_for_media_pluralism-annex_i-background%20info.pdf ) . 
  they 're currently at 25 thousand signatures ( and need a total of 1 million signatures until august ) so the sooner people vote , the better , 
  those youtube comments ... for example , there were so many allusions to germany being fascist that i simply stopped counting . 
  i hope that does n't reflect the real approval rate of the ukip , or britain is going to end up leaving the bloc for sure . 
  i always find it funny how in these maps portugal is basically chilling down in the corner , one of the ( the only one ? ), 
  few countries without a single change in borders . 
  they benefit from the single market as much as any eu member country does , thus they should be expected to contribute to the eu . 
  if they think that contributing at all is against their national interests , they 're allowed to leave ( and lose the benefits it brings , like the single market ) . 
  whether they contribute enough or too much is a different question entirely , and that 's debatable . 
  but that they contribute at all is n't . 
  the system actually works ^ ( sometimes ) !, 
  after the awful proposals pushed through the commission by germany , and them trying to block any changes , the european parliament was able to push through an actually good deal . 
  thanks to mep elisa ferreira who lead the committee for economic and monetary affairs and managed to make the initially skeptic committee ( including * all * represented european parties ) unanimously vote for and support all changes to the agreement and simply refuse to pass the original one , basically forcing the commission ( mainly germany who was basically vetoing any kind of change to the deal ) to accept all proposed changes . 
  this deal was basically written by the eu parliament instead of the commission and is actually an amazing step forward . 
  i really never expected a deal for the banking union even half as good as this . 
  it forces most of the losses when a bank goes bankrupt onto the share - and debt-holders ( ensuring that it 's actually risky for the bankers to gamble everything since they can not expect a bail-out ) , guarantees all deposits up to 100k $ ( ensuring that only huge deposit holders actually lose money ) , defines a mutual bank crisis resolution fund and ensures a single , pan-european banking oversight ( by the ecb ) to avoid future bank crises . 
  the original proposal by the commission had nothing of the sort , with for example no deposit guarantees and no actual mutual resolution fund before 2024 . 
  while that certainly is true , i 'm talking of the latest generations of reactors where fission simply stops if power is cut . 
  other than the end of the world , these reactors would never melt down . 
  also , even during the earthquake that caused fukushima 's disaster , a nearby plant , a few years younger , dai-ichi , under the exact same situation ( the biggest earthquake ever recorded in japan , and a huge tsunami ) had absolutely no problems at all , and just kept producing power throughout the whole disaster . 
  funny what difference reactor technology a few years younger makes . 
  and this is discounting the fact that common sense should tell you not to build nuclear reactors where there 's a large chance of earthquakes and tsunamis , especially not along the coast . 
  the problem is not the technology . 
  the technology has been quite safe for years ( even the biggest earthquake ever recorded in japan and the following tsunami was only able to cause fukushima which had technology from the 70s , and it does n't compare at all to the effect on the environment oil spills and fracking have ) . 
  the only problems are waste storage ( which newer reactor technologies attempt to fix ) and that people are afraid of anything with `` atom '' or `` nuclear '' in the name , no matter what it might be , and therefore basically all power plants in service today use technology from the 70s as it 's basically impossible to build a new one almost anywhere . 
   stop with random bullshit , like two eu-parlaments ; one in brussels and one in strasbourg [ the eu parliament agrees with you on that one . 
  ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/location-of-the-seats-of-the-european-union-s-institutions-motion-for-resolution-vote-resolution-as-.html ) they 've recommended to the commission to create legislation that the parliament have only one seat ( brussels ) . 
  though it does seem that france specifically does n't want anything to do with it as they like the perks of having the eu parliament sometimes meet in strasbourg . 
  while i agree with the beginning of your post , i fully disagree with the last sentence . 
   people from small countries get way too overrepresented for me to consider this democratic . 
  this is to make sure that small countries are n't simply disregarded by the larger ones , in a tyranny of the majority/largest countries . 
  otherwise , no small countries would ever join the union . 
  look at the us electoral college or the apportionment of any federal state , and you 'll find they follow the same logic . 
   distribution of seats should be `` degressively proportional '' to the population of the member states [ ( source ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament ) even in the case of the german bundestag ( which i pick as an example of a federal system that tries to force constant population/seat ratio ) , the only way to make it so that the seats are proportional to the population is by changing the size of the constituencies , redrawing their borders , if their population ever diverges too much from the average . 
  were you planning to redraw the european borders ?
