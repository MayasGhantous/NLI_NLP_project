  there 's a difference between deciding if the particular color is more greenish or more blueish and saying black is white , though . 
  let 's just do a thought experiment , then . 
  article 2 of the constitution speaks of the `` right to bear arms '' . 
  so let 's just give everyone access to rocket launchers !, 
  hell , i consider fighter jets to be `` arms '' , therefore the constitution states i have the right to keep a fighter jet in my backyard . 
  that 's my interpretation , and since judges ca n't define the correct interpretation of the constitution , nobody has the right to tell me otherwise . 
  i mean , the intention of those who wrote the constitution was clearly to keep a well regulated militia ( that 's even written in the constitution word-for-word !, 
  ) , you ca n't state that a militia without rocket launchers/fighter jets in modern time would be at all useful `` to the security of a free state '' , right ? 
  if russia ever invaded the us , there 's no way a militia without such hardware could stand up for the free state , for example . 
  * that 's * what happens when you have no judicial review - everyone interprets the law as they wish . 
  i can easily argue against the previous paragraph , but if there 's no institution to decide which interpretation is correct , my opinion does n't matter . 
  summed up , * someone * has to do judicial review . 
  de facto , it 's the judicial powers when making decisions for court cases . 
  the highest court , therefore , has last say . 
  if the legislative disagrees , they can amend the laws . 
  if the executive disagrees , they can refuse to implement them . 
  checks & balances . 
  the fact that this does not work * sometimes * , does not mean the alternatives work better . 
  and again , i agree with you in that the scotus has , multiple times , chosen very wrongly . 
  on the other hand , they sometimes have the sense to do right decisions ( for example , gay marriage ) , so it 's not * completely * broken . 
  here i am taking the time to type posts arguing for something as basic as the judicial power and judicial review , and you post a single poem that has nothing to do with the discussion , and with no explanation . 
  i mean , sure , the poem can be interpreted as being slightly relevant , but it adds literally nothing to the discussion . 
  also , speaking of the `` intent of the writers of the constitution '' , i can one-up you there :  a constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by the judges , as a fundamental law . 
  ** it therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning , as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body . 
  ** if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two , that which has the superior obligation and validity ought , of course , to be preferred ; or , in other words , the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute . 
  -- alexander hamilton ( in federalist no . 
  78 ) at least this one adds something to the discussion , and was n't just written by a `` random '' person - alexander hamilton was one of the founding fathers . 
  this quote therefore speaks more of `` the intent of the writers of the constitution '' , at least regarding this issue , than any poem you could quote ( unless a founding father was a poet ? ) . 
  anyways , there 's a ton of stuff to talk about , for example you could explain why my arguments are wrong and the supreme court does not have judicial review powers ( and who should have the power instead - because * someone must interpret law * , as far as i know we do n't write law with mathematical formulas ) . 
  if you ca n't write something more relevant to the discussion than simply quoting a poem with no further explanation , then i 'm wasting my time and this discussion is over . 
  ps : i do not disagree with you in terms of the scotus decisions being mostly wrong , at least regarding modern technologies and surveillance . 
  still , you are arguing that the scotus , the highest branch of the judicial power in the us , does not have the power of judicial review ( and therefore should not be able to interpret the constitution ) , which is a ridiculous notion . 
  you do n't even state * who * should have the power instead . 
  so , you 're a troll ( or at least discussing in bad faith ) . 
  and here i was thinking you were interested in a discussion . 
  i should n't even have bothered answering your first comment . 
  have a nice day . 
  your argument is that the judicial does not have power to interpret laws ? 
  obviously , you have n't got a single clue about law , because that 's ridiculous . 
  i mean , if someone interprets law one way and thinks they are n't breaking the law , and the police interprets it another way and thinks otherwise , arresting you , the decision over which was the correct interpretation ( if any ) * is up to the judges * , right ? 
  we 're not talking of mathematics , where there 's only one single solution/way to read a formula . 
  text ( and therefore law ) has a ton of different interpretations , by definition it 's the judicial power ( the judges ) , specifically those with jurisdiction , that define the correct interpretation , as part of the separation of powers . 
  the supreme court has jurisdiction over constitutional affairs , so clearly they 're the ones that define the `` correct interpretation '' . 
  please name a democracy ( an actual one , not a dictatorship pretending to be a democracy ) where that is n't the case . 
  if you believe '' [ the constitution ] is pretty straightforward '' , then you have no idea what you 're talking about , as most of what it says can be interpreted ( even without evil intentions ) a million different ways , just look at the thousands of supreme court cases since the constitution was created . 
  if you disagree with the judicial interpretation ( and i 'm not saying you 're wrong to ) , it 's possible to amend the law ( in this case , the constitution ) and make your interpretation more obvious . 
  it 's actually one of the checks & balances between the legislative and the judicial powers , and it has been used multiple times in the past after supreme court cases . 
  emphasis mine :  ** the judicial power of the united states , shall be vested in one supreme court ** , and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish . 
  [ ... ] ** the judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this constitution ** , the laws of the united states , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority . 
  [ ... ] in all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state shall be party , ** the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction . 
  in all the other cases before mentioned , the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction ** , both as to law and fact , with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the congress shall make . 
  -- article iii , section 2 , clause 1  ** this constitution ** , and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the united states , ** shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby ** , any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding . 
  [ ... ] [ a ] ll executive and judicial officers , both of the united states and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this constitution . 
  -- the supremacy clause of article vi -------- because i 'm not feeling like summing up the supreme court case [ marbury v. madison ] ( https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html ) ( 1803 ) , where your exact question was asked , i 'll take this explanation from wikipedia :  the supremacy clause says '' [ t ] his constitution '' is the `` supreme law of the land . '', 
  the constitution therefore is the fundamental law of the united states . 
  federal statutes are the law of the land only when they are `` made in pursuance '' of the constitution . 
  state constitutions and statutes are valid only if they are consistent with the constitution . 
  any law contrary to the constitution is void . 
  the federal judicial power extends to all cases `` arising under this constitution . '', 
   as part of their inherent duty to determine the law , the federal courts have the duty to interpret and apply the constitution and to decide whether a federal or state statute conflicts with the constitution . 
  all judges are bound to follow the constitution . 
  if there is a conflict , the federal courts have a duty to follow the constitution and to treat the conflicting statute as unenforceable . 
  the supreme court has final appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising under the constitution , so the supreme court has the ultimate authority to decide whether statutes are consistent with the constitution . 
  the special-needs doctrine comes from the 2001 ** supreme court ** case ferguson v. city of charleston , with the test i quoted above defined by the supreme court in henderson v. city of semi valley ( 2002 ) . 
  it 's as constitutional as it gets , unless you 're saying that the us constitution does not give the supreme court interpretative powers ( judicial review ) over what is constitutional and what is not . 
  right , i now understand what you meant , thanks . 
  still , even if you say that it is illegal ^ ( supreme court decision pending in the far-flung future ) , it 's still * happening * under a broad interpretation of existing laws/the special-needs doctrine . 
  it 's not a given that the supreme court would rule against it , either . 
  for all we know , they might do it the french way , and declare everything constitutional . 
  the french situation is worse - they no longer have a `` supreme court '' to take the laws to , since their constitutional court has already given it the go-ahead . 
  that might not be completely correct , though - i think they could still take it to the ecj . 
  does anyone here more familiar with the legal system in france/the eu know if the ecj has any powers in such a situation ( could they declare the surveillance to be illegal and force france to give it up ) , and if so , what would it take to bring a case to them ? 
  [ you could just as easily have googled `` special needs doctrine '' , of course it 's not written directly in the constitution itself . 
  ] ( http://www.legalupdateonline.com/4th/587 )  special needs searches : an exception to the search warrant requirement , as well as the need to even show any `` individualized suspicion , '' is when a search is found to serve `` special needs '' beyond the need for normal law enforcement . 
  back to top test  test : the legality of a warrantless search under the `` special needs '' exception is determined by balancing ( 1 ) the need to search against ( 2 ) the constitutional intrusiveness of the search . 
  ( henderson v. city of semi valley ( 9th cir . 
  2002 ) 305 f. 3rd 1052 , 1059 ; citing ferguson v. city of charleston ( 2001 ) 532 u.s. 67 , 78 [ 149 l.ed .2 nd 205 ] . ), 
  a broadened interpretation of that doctrine was used to justify the fisa warrantless surveillance , from what i know , but i do n't remember where exactly i read it . 
  a cursory glance at the wikipedia fisa courts article seems to agree ( they specifically mention the special-needs doctrine as justification for meta-data collection , among many other things ) , though as always , its wikipedia , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  i 'm not fooled . 
  the problem is , many people are :(, 
   yes , they collect what is know as `` meta data '' . 
  i 'm against meta-data collection as well , but that 's not my point - * just * collecting meta-data is not as far-reaching as the new french rules . 
  the french rules allow actual * spying * on french citizens without a warrant ( only requiring the rubber stamp of a secret court ) . 
   the stories about the nsa or secret fisa courts are examples of those entities breaking the law - it 's not supposed to be happening and there was clearly a huge backlash against those programs . 
  wait , are you saying fisa court decisions are illegal ? 
  please explain what you meant . 
  because as far as i know , fisa courts uses the `` special-needs doctrine '' of the 4th ammendment 's warrants clause to bypass the warrants limitation and for example force service providers to supply the intelligence agencies with anything they want . 
  but as i 'm not an american , my knowledge is very superficial , so i 'd be interested in being corrected . 
  `` everybody is doing it '' does n't make `` it '' right , nor does it make `` it '' any less worth fighting against . 
  also , do those countries have laws comparable to the new french ones ? 
  i know the usa does , but i do n't remember hearing about anything * as far-reaching as this * for other eu countries . 
  i may just have missed it though , but lqdn tends to report on such laws eu-wide . 
  for example , do those countries allow the intelligence agencies to spy on literally anyone , simply with the rubber stamp of a secret court nominated by the government itself ( infringing on separation of powers between executive and judicial ) ? 
  do they require isps to install black boxes on their networks ? 
  serious question . 
  this observatory gathers the cecil , creis-terminal , the human rights league , the syndicat de la magistrature , the syndicat des avocats de france and la quadrature du net . 
  the parts of the communiqu\u00e9 that seems most important to me :  [ ... ] by approving the bypassing of a judge , ** the principle of the separation of powers is gravely damaged ** , even though it is a fundamental democratic guarantee . 
  as such , a judicial judge , set to safeguard individual freedoms , is completely ignored . 
  furthermore , citizens will have the right in theory to file complaints against the french state council , in regards to unknown proceedings as they are secret by nature .
