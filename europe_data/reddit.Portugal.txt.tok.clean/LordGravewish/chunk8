  this has nothing of a real right of appeal !, 
   [ ... ]  the message is clear : ** the constitutional council is not an obstacle ** for the `` decisive progress '' ( in the words of pm manuel valls ) made by establishing a general surveillance system over the french population . 
   the observatoire des libert\u00e9s et du num\u00e9rique strongly condemns this wayward trend toward a panoptical society , where all citizens may be spied upon . 
  this path reflects the shipwreck of a government in disarray , ready to trample the fundamental ideals of the republic , and acting against the interests of our society by manipulating our fears . 
  you 're incorrect , at least regarding 1 ( do n't know about the rest ) . 
  all versions other than enterprise and education share updates with the whole world by default , [ according to microsoft themselves ] ( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/windows-update-delivery-optimization-faq# ) :  delivery optimisation is turned on by default for all editions of windows 10 , with the following differences :  * windows 10 enterprise and windows 10 education : the pcs on your local network option is turned on by default . 
   * all other editions of windows 10 : the pcs on your local network and pcs on the internet option is turned on by default . 
  `` that ** is ** weird . . '' i guess it technically is 3 words ? 
  and has all the ingredients to turn bad , fast . 
  i 'm still an optimist that this all can be worked out , but it 's not going to be easy . 
  to be fair , i just used the exact same title as the article . 
  and remember that la quadrature du net is a * french * ngo , similar to the eff , that has been fighting this crap since it was founded in 2008 . 
  them being angry after such a stupid law passes is more than acceptable . 
  basically , the service providers have to allow the security agencies to be able to place a device in the internal data-center network , without any idea of what the device does . 
  these devices must then have all traffic routed through them . 
  theoretically , such devices can then do anything they want . 
  for example , record traffic , block traffic , tamper with traffic , send a copy of the traffic to a different server , masquerade as one of the servers hosted in that data center , etc. 
  meanwhile , the isp has literally no idea what the device is doing . 
  even if we were to trust the device and knew that it 's not doing any harm , it 's still a huge security flaw for the isp 's internal network . 
  the `` algorithmic black box '' name comes from the fact that you do not know which algorithms the device is running . 
  it 's a tactic that has been used for a long time by the nsa , supposedly . 
   scope , black boxes , elimination of judicial oversight , no protection of attorney-client privilege and other protected professions , as well as the confidentiality of journalists ' sources , absence of transparency with respect to the abuses found : almost all of the provisions of the surveillance law are declared to be constitutional . 
  ** only international surveillance is censored ** , which paradoxically may strengthen the intelligence services in their practices without any legal basis . 
  that 's a weird decision . 
  i was expecting the opposite - where international surveillance would be allowed , while national surveillance not . 
   however , we will continue the fight against this wicked law and all those which will follow wherever we can , especially before the european institutions and jurisdictions . 
  let 's hope this results in something , though i seriously doubt it at this point . 
  -------- now to start planning how to move my server out of the country . 
  i 'll take my business elsewhere , and with it the tax money from my monthly payments . 
  anyone know in which eu countries it is still illegal for surveillance services to black-box service providers ? 
  i 'd prefer having my server somewhere where the law protects my privacy , instead of giving the security services a * carte blanche * to spy on me . 
  not that my traffic matters much , and i have nothing to hide , but this is a matter of principle . 
  i simply find it disgusting to know that the law allows the state to circumvent due process like this , and want no part in it . 
  this shit should be illegal everywhere , and anyone advocating for it should be tried for high treason against democracy . 
  well , now seriously , they should at least be tapped under these laws and have all their private communication periodically released to the public . 
  let 's see how they like the taste of their medicine - i mean , they have * nothing * to hide , right ? 
  some time ago the portuguese circlejerk subreddit / r/portugalcaralho organied an `` invasion '' of the spanish circlejerk subreddit r/epana what you 're looking at is the result ( the top most-voted posts there are all from that ) . 
   all right . 
  times where germany and the uk will agree to cede important executive power to brussels without a powerfull representative in it like their own head of state : never , ever . 
  i never said otherwise , though i 'm slightly more optimistic than you , assuming a correctly built system . 
  in such a correctly-built system , the bicameral representatives ( mps of the lower chamber , and state representatives on the higher chamber ) are these `` powerful representatives '' themselves , there 's no need for more of them . 
   your point on the voting system is extremely interesting however . 
  which specific point ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i made quite a few points , so i 'm not sure which you are specifically referring to :p  one of the big problems with the us senate is that on paper it 's utopia but in practice it does n't exactly run that good , as shown by the insane corruption levels and one-figure approval rate since years . 
  though those are mostly * implementation problems * , for example due to the gerrymandering and fptp system . 
  i am convinced that with a lot of thought behind it , these issues could be avoided . 
  the quote from wikipedia about the us senate is a justification for the * existence * of a senate , not necessarily for the actual implementation . 
  therefore , it 's still quite relevant ( and the points it makes are hard to argue against ) . 
   well ; on the other side it allows for faster decisions . 
  it requires qualified majority . 
  that 's not faster decisions ( though if it had simple majority , i would agree ) . 
   one of the main issues with the parliament is that it 's incredibly bloated . 
  sadly , in reality you ca n't always have a large scale vote when there a huge crisis destroying the country . 
  the point of the legislative branch is * to be slow * . 
  a higher chamber is * not * part of the executive , it 's part of the legislative , it 's not supposed to be fast - that 's why you have the government . 
  a legislative branch * needs * plurality of opinion . 
   that 's why executive-minded branchs are always centered about a few very powerfull people that call in the immediate shots . 
  and each country having at least one means they wo n't be too screwed over most of the time . 
  yup , that 's why you should have a government accountable to the legislative . 
  the government can do stuff quickly , but it 's dependent on the acceptance of the legislative . 
  in a good system , you should have a commission directly accountable to the legislative ( and therefore indirectly accountable to the electorate ) , and the legislative should be representative of * both * the people and the states - for that you need a bicameral system ( or equi-populational states , with similar economies , etc ) . 
  my point is that the council is designed as a legislative institution according to the treaties , but it * de facto * still has many legislative powers , to the point that it 's the current main legislative * and * executive institution . 
  it makes no sense to get rid of the actual executive institution , because it 's already there ( the commission ) - it makes sense to get rid of the `` executive '' part of the council , and give more powers to the executive . 
   but sometime at executive level it 's just outright classified for safety reasons as you say , it 's normal that the executive meet in secret , but the legislative * must be completely transparent * , as it 's supposed to be directly accountable to the electorate . 
  without such transparency , there 's no way for it to be controlled by the electorate . 
  the council , designed in the current treaties as a part of the legislative , has no excuse to meet in secret . 
   if that 's accountability that worries you , maybe a better solution would be a stronger audit/anti-corruption bureau that remains fully independant and can peek in all the classified stuff and stop/denounce any shady dealings ? 
  and it 's not impossible the problem is , who are those institutions accountable to ? 
  if no-one , then they end up becoming corrupt in the long-run . 
  they 're usually accountable to the legislative ( since the legislative has powers to change the laws that regulate the anti-corruption bureau ) , and the legislative is accountable to the electorate ( it would be a scandal if they disbanded the anti-corruption rules ) . 
  this means that by proxy , the anti-corruption bureau is accountable to the electorate . 
  summed up , the legislative needs to be accountable directly to the electorate - because if it is n't , then nothing is . 
  ------ i think the main problem here is that you see the council as part of the * executive * branch , when that 's not the case . 
  the current design of the eu treaties defines the council as part of the * legislative * branch , with similar powers to the euparl . 
  the problem is that the council * de facto * has executive power , because it can pool member state executive powers ( which are more powerful than the commission ) . 
  this makes it the * de facto * executive institution in europe , while at the same time having legislative powers . 
  this is why i say that the council is one of the worst parts of the eu , since it 's one of the main flaws in terms of separation of powers . 
  also , any institution with legislative powers should never meet in secret ( because otherwise , you remove the accountability of the legislative to the electorate ) , and the council breaks that `` rule '' . 
  the solution is not to remove the higher chamber completely , it 's to separate the executive power of the member states directly from the eu-wide legislative power , by making the mandates separate and adding transparency to the higher chamber . 
  then , give the commission more powers ( removing some from the member state governments ) , and make it an actual federal government . 
  if you simply remove the higher chamber , and make it completely executive , you now have lost representativity of member states on the eu legislative branch , and removed accountability of the executive power of the eu to the legislative of the eu ( the parliament ) , since you 're allowing the governments to bypass the eu entirely ( as they have the executive power at member-state level , there 's no need for a legislative power at eu level ) . 
  that 's completely broken , any way i look at it . 
  we 're discussing a federated government , it does not make sense that the eu government ( commission ) has basically less * executive * powers than the legislative branch . 
  also , it reminds me , the eu parliament does not even have legislative initiative - it can only ask the commission ( the government ) to start the procedure in its name . 
  this also makes no sense , and means that the legislative is * not * separated from the executive , even assuming everything else were to work perfectly . 
  we could , inspired by your ideas , make the heads of government part of the eu commission , such that they only have * executive * power . 
  the problem there , then , is that the heads of government are * not * accountable to the eu legislative - they 're accountable to the member states ' legislative . 
  this means that the eu legislative power has basically * no way * to control the eu executive , and therefore might as well just not exist at all . 
  the obvious conclusion is that you 'd be returning to the intra-governmental eu without direct representation where the only people who have any actual power are the heads of government . 
  it would be difficult to legitimize non-unanimous eu-wide legislation changes , so we 'd just be walking back a few decades as far as integration goes . 
   i think it 's a mistake to mix something based on the current council with a potential second chamber : the current council is made of people from the executive , with an executive background , mindset , and hat when it comes to them acting . 
  that 's my point . 
  the current council should not have legislative powers , nor a second executive power . 
  the member state governments should be * member state * governments , not eu governments or legislators . 
  however , the solution is not to remove the higher chamber entirely , it 's to separate it from the member state governments . 
   furthermore i do n't understand why you would add a second `` senate '' chamber . 
  could you explain to me what advantage that brings over having `` just '' the parliament ? 
  i 'll quote an explanation i wrote a while ago , as to why a federal system should be bicameral : a bicameral system is usually used in a federal government . 
  in a bicameral system , there are `` two parliaments '' . 
  the lower chamber corresponds to what in portugal is the `` assembleia da r\u00e9publica '' ( the `` main '' parliament ) .
