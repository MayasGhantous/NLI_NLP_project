  the lower chamber is supposed to be mostly proportional to the population , similar to `` 1 person , 1 vote '' ( although due to other issues you can never achieve 100 % proportionality , and some places will weigh slightly more than others ) . 
  for a normal state , this effectively means that larger population centers have more weight , as they end up electing more mps . 
  for example , even in portugal , a rural city will have less decision weight than the capital city of lisbon , just for the simple fact that there are more people living in lisbon and therefore more mps representing it . 
  now , while you might say that is fair , if taken to the extreme of a large country/federal state , you do not want a smaller state ( like portugal ) being `` ignored '' because larger states ( like germany ) have a much larger population . 
  but you also do n't want to make it so that a portuguese person 's vote is worth more ( as it 'd be unfair to the german people ) . 
  so what happens , for example in the us , is that you have a higher chamber ( usually called the senate ) . 
  this chamber consists of multiple representatives of each state/region in the country , where each state/region elects the * same * number of representatives , no matter their population . 
  for example , each us state elects ** two ** senators . 
  no matter if there are 10 times as many people living in state 1 versus state 2 . 
  this higher chamber usually has veto powers , and its main reason for existing is so that states are not `` ignored '' during the decision-making process . 
  an advantage from having two chambers , is that you can add checks & balances between them , where each chamber tries to make sure the other chamber is following the rules , so that there are now * two * chambers to corrupt instead of just one . 
  wikipedia says this regarding the us senate ( emphasis mine ) :  the framers of the constitution created a bicameral congress primarily as ** a compromise between those who felt that each state , since it was sovereign , should be equally represented , and those who felt the legislature must directly represent the people ** , as the house of commons did in the united kingdom . 
  this idea of having one chamber represent people equally , while the other gives equal representation to states regardless of population , was known as the connecticut compromise . 
  ** there was also a desire to have two houses that could act as an internal check on each other ** . 
  ** one was intended to be a `` people 's house '' directly elected by the people ** , and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents . 
  ** the other was intended to represent the states ** to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government . 
  the senate was thus not intended to represent the people of the united states equally . 
  ** the constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation . 
  ** in the current eu framework , the council takes up the role of the higher chamber ( representing the states ) , while the eu parliament takes the role of the lower chamber ( representing the people ) . 
  however , the construction of the council ( higher chamber ) is flawed in that there is a single representative per country ( so no plurality of opinion ) , representatives are n't elected directly for the job on european campaigns ( they 're the heads of the national government themselves ) , and most negotiations happen behind close doors so they are n't accountable , on top of being able to blame `` brussels '' and not themselves whenever the electorate does n't like one of their decisions . 
  it also requires qualified majority ( instead of just simple majority ) . 
  these are just a few issues that make the council end up being probably the worst of all the eu institutions when it comes to democratic legitimacy . 
  a real , correctly implemented federation , needs to get rid of the council and replace it by a democratically elected senate , with clear rules , procedures and transparency during negotiations , so that the representatives are directly accountable to the electorate . 
  the us senate is part of the legislative power , together with the us parliament . 
  the legislative power can veto decisions of the government , it 's one of the checks & balances in any democratic system . 
  if you can get a majority in the senate and parliament , you can literally dissolve the executive power . 
  therefore , a senate/parliament has the right to sign a document stating that if the government does something , they are willing to call a vote of no confidence . 
  if such a document is signed by less than a majority of the senate + parliament , though , it 's basically a worthless scrap of paper , so who cares about what it says . 
  also , the council + euparl are supposed to be legislative ( a bicameral system ) , while the commission is executive . 
  you want to give the council executive and legislative powers , and that makes absolutely no sense . 
   i simply think that the comission should be outright dissolved/pushed out because they are n't elected . 
  and the council should replace them as de facto executive power . 
  the legislative is the parliament ; and we already have an independant judiciary that could easily be expanded upon in a federal manner . 
  seriously ? 
  you want your head of governments to be the european government ? 
  and that 's because the commission ( who are basically the federal government chosen by the euparl ** and ** the council ) are n't elected ? 
  what the hell ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
   i do n't really care about that one either way ; they `` simply '' have to publish publickly the decided laws however . 
  okay , i 'm stopping this discussion . 
  there 's no way someone who supports a parliament always meeting behind closed doors in a democracy is not a troll , or at least an extremist who would prefer to live in a dictatorship . 
  i mean , why have a parliament anyways ? 
  we could just directly elect the ministers in the government and give them the power to do anything they want . 
  to be fair to them , it makes sense to prepare reports for all possibilities . 
  best case , it 's not used . 
  worst case , you 're prepared for the eventuality . 
  one of the biggest mistakes of the greek government - their whole strategy depended on bluffing that they might leave the euro , but when their bluff gets called they suddenly noticed that they had n't prepared for that eventuality , and had to completely give in . 
  but people who disagree with the us senate * can vote for other people * . 
  also , the senate supposedly does not have powers that would allow them to influence foreign policy like that by themselves ( it 's the * government 's * job , with agreement of * both * the us parliament and senate ) , so that letter is at best the senators stating their position if it ever comes to a vote - and a minority of senators even then ( and to be fair , if a chamber of a parliament were to overwhelmingly sign a document against a measure by the government , that 's not `` high treason '' - it 's just telling the government what to expect , similar to threatening a motion of no confidence ) . 
  you are blaming the senate , while the people * elected them as representatives * , and * keep electing them * . 
  most of the problems with the us senate can be traced to the stupid gerrymandered fptp electoral system , while the problems with the council can be traced to the fact that the heads of government are making decisions behind closed doors and are not accountable . 
  the council 's situation is much worse . 
  also , worth pointing repeating ( i edited this into my previous comment , but probably too late for you to read it ) : comparison with the ministerial palace is ridiculous . 
  the council is not supposed to be a government , because that 's the commission 's job . 
  the council is the higher chamber of a bicameral parliamentary system . 
  it 's supposed to represent the member states at a federal level , while the lower chamber ( eu parliament ) represents the people . 
  and negotiations behind closed doors are the antithesis of a parliamentary system , and very unrepresentative , otherwise why would n't you just make the euparl meet behind closed doors as well ? 
  my point is that , while a higher chamber is required , the current construction of the higher chamber is very bad . 
  it 's ridiculous to state it 's one of the few bits that are working , when it flies against the face of what is regarded as an effective and democratic higher chamber , and when most of today 's problems in the eu ( such as the effectiveness of lobbying ) can be traced back to it ( or other similar institutions , like the eurogroup ) . 
  comparison with the ministerial palace is ridiculous . 
  the council is ** not ** supposed to be a government , because that 's the commission 's job . 
  the council is the ** higher chamber of a bicameral parliamentary system ** , and there 's no justification for secrecy . 
  it 's supposed to represent the member states at a federal level , while the lower chamber ( eu parliament ) represents the people . 
  it should not be a simple meeting of heads of government behind closed door . 
  it should be a meeting of * specifically elected representatives for the job * ( in order for them to be democratically accountable ) , with multiple representatives per country to represent plurality of opinion ( at least 2 ; and each country no matter the population should have the same number ) , with well-codified parliamentary procedures including transparency . 
  something more like the [ us senate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_senate ) ( directly elected ) , with some inspiration from the [ french senate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senate_%28france%29 ) ( indirectly elected ) or the [ german senate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesrat_of_germany ) ( indirectly elected ) . 
   the eu council is still democratic because their members are the leaders of country that are all the result of democratic elections in their home countries . 
  the eu council is designed as a higher chamber of a bicameral parliament , representing the member states while the euparl ( lower chamber ) represents the people . 
  the problem is that , no matter whether every representative in the eu council was elected separately , they were elected for a separate reason ( as head of government ) . 
  it does n't help that the eu council does most of the negotiations behind closed doors , making the representatives in the council completely unaccountable . 
  if they do bad decisions on the council , very little people will hear about it , and most will simply blame `` the eu '' - the head of government will never be punished electorally for their actions in the council . 
  as i 'm sure you 're aware , that 's not exactly a good democratic system . 
  you do realize a federation would have an elected democratic bicameral parliamentary government overseeing a federal budget , and with powers to influence budgets of member states and avoid huge deficits like the greek case in the first place ? 
  it would n't be `` taxation without representation '' , which is what `` transfer union '' implies . 
  or do you consider the us a `` transfer union '' , considering their federal budget is 20 % of gdp ? 
  i 'm surprised you did n't translate the part in german as well :p, 
  i never realized how bad the seafaring industry can be , this is truly scary ... how the hell can that ship get away with so much ? 
  and more importantly , how the hell do we improve the situation ? 
  amazing report , this is what good journalism looks like . 
  ca n't wait for the second part . 
  whoa , i feel very important already !, 
  thanks :d by the way , your username i do recognize :p actually , it 's probably one of the only four usernames i recognize on r/europe . 
  the second one belongs to a certain french mod whose dual-language posts are hard to miss , and the third one to a certain british eurosceptic whose opinions i usually enjoy reading ( even though i 'm not eurosceptic myself ) . 
  the fourth and last one is a certain controversial commenter with an australian flair ( or a similar one , ca n't quite recall ) , mostly from his ( interesting , and very controversial ) comments over isds . 
  so yeah , you 're part of my `` top 4 most recognizable r/europe-eans '' . 
  you should be proud of that :d, 
  i must be one of the few people who has absolutely no patience to tag people . 
  i think i must 've tagged only two people in the years since i 've installed res ( and none of them on r/europe ) . 
  i do n't even care much if i 've seen people here before , when i comment i rarely read the username anyways ( i look at the flag , at best ) . 
  as i am writing this , i do n't even remember your username :p ^ ( ps : what about me , i 've been here for ages , though i mostly lurk so i only have about 1500 comment karma on r/europe . 
  am i tagged ? 
   it is not the non ez-countries concern if an ez - country needs money fast . 
  that is something the ez have to pay for-not the eu . 
  sure . 
  and the money will be back to non-ez countries at the latest in 3 months , even if greece completely disappeared from the maps ( what do n't you understand by `` ring-fenced by the ecb '' ? 
  it 's literally risk-free ) . 
  or do you literally not care about your fellow eu-member greece , and you 'd prefer it to have a complete collapse because you 're obstructing the usage of the efsf for no reason ? 
   as for ez and the ecb following the rules ... you do know that it is absolutely forbidden to bail out individual countries ? 
  read into the [ efsf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility ) . 
  i 'll make it easy for you :  it was agreed by the 27 member states of the european union on 9 may 2010 , with the objective of preserving financial stability in europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in economic difficulty .
