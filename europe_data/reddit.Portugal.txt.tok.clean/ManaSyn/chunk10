  why , because he soloed it ? 
  we will when time travel is invented !, 
  but it 's the same again . 
  america was virtually terra incognita , even if we had knowledge of it , australia was n't even in anyone 's dreams yet . 
  india was the huge , rich empire from whom we could benefit the most with trade at the time . 
  keeping in mind the portuguese empire was never one of conquest and domination because we simply did not have the manpower , but of trade and diplomacy ( some gunboat diplomacy , too ) . 
  it was the smart political choice to make at the time . 
  i understand that , but because all proof of it was burned down in the earthquake , it remains a theory only , sadly . 
  that we moved the treaty of tordesillas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) line to the west because we already knew about the existence of brazil long before columbus ever reached america . 
  oh , and that columbus was a portuguese spy sent to spain in a successful ^ * attempt to divert their attention and resources away from india . 
  yes , we live in the past . 
  the glorious , rich , # 1 past ... ^ * india was the shit back then , not america . 
  no it is n't . 
  just like every other foreigner , it is just lumped up with spain in the map ... 
  fair enough . 
  but i still think it is bold to compare two pairs of places without ever being there . 
   all of them have problems , i think that is the only similarity that covers all ~ ~ europeans ~ ~ people ftfy, 
   i do n't know how to prove this to you , but i can personally guarantee that nogales , arizona is as different from manhattan as spain is from estonia . 
  but i guess that 's subjective . 
  i do n't mean to either agree or disagree , i 'm just curious how you could guarantee that . 
  have you been to all four places ? 
   the definition of ` bigotry ' is a lot broader than the definition of ` crime ' not particularly true or relevant for that matter . 
   european cultures are not actually as diverse you guys like to think again , irrelevant . 
  regardless of diversity , according to you there are still millions of people with the same idea . 
  i find it particularly funny when we get slammed for judging gypsies as one by being judged as one . 
   baseless bigotry for made-up reasons is not exactly unprecedented correct . 
  but you are not one to say it is baseless because , as you said , you are an outsider . 
  you can only sit on your high horse and judge others based on what is not happening to you . 
  so what you are saying is that between existing an entire * culture * of criminals and existing several different and diverse * cultures * who are all bigots based on `` tradition '' and confirmation bias , ockham 's razor would give you the latter as the most probable ? 
  that just reads as huge contradiction , btw . 
  the lusosphere also has strong indian influence in some food . 
  sure it is n't as strong as the british cuisine , but it is there . 
  that said , there is also african influence ( and the french have it too ) . 
  there is spicy food in europe , i assure you . 
  no aversion at all , i do n't think . 
  or birmingstan . 
   * aversion to spicy food i know people have mentioned this already , but i would like to know what gives you this impression . 
  i 'm just trying to understand the etymology of chromodynamics . 
  the movement of colour ? 
  the really revolutionary thing about this is that we 're finally introducing hit points to real life armour . 
  at least that 's the impression i get from those little balls . 
  what a shitty legend . 
  that 's pretty much the entire portuguese 20 ^ th century . 
  was wondering who the other two portuguese laureates were . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nobel_laureates_by_country#portugal i do n't think the two east timorenses count as portuguese for this matter , even if they were indeed born in ( overseas ) portugal . 
  i would die by bursting into laughter if i saw a giant minion rolling around in the street before i even crashed into something . 
  oh god , shut the fuck up and calm down . 
  it 's just an internet comment , do n't read so much into it . 
  maybe i should have added quotes under `` current '' so little fairies like yourself would n't cry me a fucking river . 
  could you point me to the relevant quote ? 
  i ca n't see anywhere that says greek ego is younger than latin . 
  he 's taking a jab at current arabic hygiene . 
  an obvious and necessary measure to make sure they do some work at the [ parliament ] ( http://www.rt.com/uk/310857-parliament-porn-sites-access/ ) . 
  quite . 
  fucking hell , i do n't understand the `` glory '' in a dead animal or a rigged game ... those images make me sad . 
  . jpeg okay then . 
   you disagree with me wayyy to much . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  fun fact : this fact chain is brought to you by german humour . 
  no fun , all fact . 
  i guess this is where their confusion comes from : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scooter_ ( motorcycle ), 
  yeah i 'm guessing this is mostly a language issue . 
  in my language , there is such a thing as a good gypsy culture . 
  you know , the singing , dancing , beautiful people , etc. 
  not all use of `` cigano '' is perjorative in portuguese . 
  a simple dictionary entry : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gypsy  noun  gypsy ( plural gypsies )  1 . 
  ( sometimes offensive ) alternative form of gypsy : a member of the romani people . 
  ( offensive ) an itinerant person or any person suspected of making a living from dishonest practices or theft ; a member of a nomadic people , ** not necessarily romani ** ; a carny . 
  as i said , gypsies are those who follow that culture . 
  but there is a lot of confusion as it 's usually a synonym with the roma themselves in a lot of languages , including english as shown . 
  i think people are confused here : roma/romani is indeed the ethnicity , gypsy is the road-traveler culture . 
  the confusion stems from the fact that in many languages , they are synonyms . 
  [ socrates ] ( http://portugalresident.com/sites/default/files/styles/node-detail/public/field/image/socrates%20in%20jail.jpg?itok=ujpawn6h ) did indeed not know anything . 
  not sure why you are giving me all those indications ( i 'm portuguese !, 
  ) , but thanks anyway , that 's cool of you !, 
  not really , the models work fine up to 5 days in the mesoscale . 
  you 're talking about large scales . 
  in that regard , yes , it is easy enough to read the maps . 
  tbh , that predictions beyond 10 - 15 days are correct is more of a coincidence than anything else , since they are probalistic . 
  also , keep in mind that weather extremes have been thougher and more frequent , and thus an event like 2003 is bound to repeat and eventually be exceded . 
  or that it will be colder . 
  we ca n't say something has been worse until we go trough it ( weather predictions beyond ten days are too unreliable as is ) . 
  but yes , here 's hoping this summer wo n't turn into hell as 2003 was . 
  do n't be so hasty . 
  the record temperature in germany in 2003 was 40.4 \u00b0 c according to that link . 
  that is for the entire summer in 2003 . 
  we 're only two weeks in 2015 summer and op 's forecast image already has 40 \u00b0 c in it . 
  it is only going to get hotter as summer advances and more energy is pumped into the northern hemisphere . 
  we do n't remove generations anymore around these parts . 
  it 's crazy how you can go on about your life , enjoying a stroll , and some maniac decides running you over is fun . 
  thanks for translating , for all i knew it would be a volcano . 
  that happened here in portugal as well ... 1 $ = 200 $ , so the correct stance would have been to divide former prices by 200 , but plenty shops divided by 100 instead because prices would seem very similar ( eg , something costing 100 $ would now cost 1 $ ) , effectively doubling prices in many things . 
  because things cost 9,99 $ rather than 10 $ . 
  you should add food to this list . 
  it is our finest art . 
  our internet laughter is as much lol and haha as anyone else . 
  we do not huehuehue , rsrsrs or kkkkkk . 
  that is a brazillian thing only . 
  this is what [ double disrespect ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gr1cenc.jpg ) feels like :(, 
  well , yes .
