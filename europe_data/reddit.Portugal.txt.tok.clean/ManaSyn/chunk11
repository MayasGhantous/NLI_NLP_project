  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is also just called [ silicosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis ) . 
  i agree . 
  the same can be said for pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis , i am sure . 
  no , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfr-adaki-c ) would be the longest technical word in english . 
  went to greece two months ago , learnt that then . 
  i really thought it was rather plain , kinda like iberia . 
  no idea why ... 
  gave me a whole new view on ancient greece city-state politics . 
  probably the brazilian names . 
  i have nothing against brazilian , mind you , but some names are terrible , like edivaldos and the like . 
  the absolute worst/best has to be madeinusa ( read like ma-they-noosa ) . 
  i have several : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_united_states, 
  dunno , if my girlfriend had the body of a 21 years-old i 'd be very pleased . 
  but i much prefer her mature personality at the current age than that of a 21 years-old . 
  to be fair , publicity was supposed to be just that , publicize an information . 
  it was supposed to be about facts , just like news . 
  but that changed a long time ago when someone realized facts alone do n't sell . 
  i did n't know about # 7 to be honest . 
  do n't listen to him , he 's belgian so he looks where there are handy people , none of the rest of us would actually move to the us . 
  you misunderstand my words . 
  i never said i 'd be surprised that some christians did some evil . 
   university degrees being so long ( you get a proper education at 25/26 ) is there a reason for that or people are just lazy like here in portugal ? 
  for arguments sake , how different would your ( i do n't mean the mods ) reaction be if it were christians throwing muslims overboard ? 
  it would disgust me just as well , but i must admit i would be surprised it was n't the other way around . 
  as it is , however , does n't surprise me any bit . 
  we should blame them , not the religion . 
  ah , that makes sense , thanks !, 
  is n't the tos supposed to be informed consent ? 
  i guess that 's why they 're called `` north atlantic '' . 
  really tho , it 's the first time i 've heard of an operational range for nato as well . 
  oh , i ca n't imagine the british installing big , dirty buildings in the middle of the city , because that has never happened before . 
  oh , you know bureaucracy . 
  ftfy, 
  to be fair that was in amsterdam , she sounded like she was quite high . 
  i have one of [ these ] ( http://www.commerciol.com/webroot/storept/shops/ea1248/4aaf/ac59/f4d5/344f/ba94/52df/a378/46cf/commerciol__0020_navalha_0020_cuchila.jpg ) with me when i 'm on the countryside , i mostly use it to cut bread and chouri\u00e7o . 
  never in the city , tho , there is no need for it . 
  actually , espectar means to view . 
  espectador is a viewer . 
  like , a tv show or football game viewer . 
  and espetar means the same . 
  the finance minister of greece does not really represent the greek people , that would be the president or , in a lesser scale , the prime minister . 
  interesting i just read this , i had just been invited to watch [ black souls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_souls ) next week , it is precisely about them . 
  maybe you could also check it out and learn about them . 
  read this in an italian accent . 
  how are dinosaur eggs an icon ? 
  sweden . 
  haha , penis palace . 
  you are correct in your text , pena means penance ( can also mean shame or sorrow ) , but i never thought foreigners would hear it as penis palace ... maybe i 'm guilty of that myself . 
  that would explain some faces . 
  it is a really marvelous place , that palace . 
  a bit weird too . 
  all of sintra is beautiful , and it was very posh for the european aristocracy a few centuries ago . 
  `` except both of these '' refers to france and the netherlands , not brazil and france . 
  we live in the past . 
  cronological order : sex , anal , democracy and gyros . 
  another question : what the fuck does it say ? 
  yeah , also noticed that , ca n't tell if it 's multiple mice , a fucked up rabbit , or what ... 
  what do you mean , should they have to change their way of life completely because they 're victims ? 
  the uk has land all over the world , the sun still does not set in the empire . 
  i find it amazing how there was still an ottoman empire so little time ago . 
  not for them , but for its history , it was one of the big empires of the world . 
  kinda like there 's still sort of a british empire . 
  what memorandum did we leave exactly ? 
  spain never conquered portugal , there was a united kingdom for 60 years . 
  would hitler consider black people from a former german colony as actual germans ? 
  he would n't even consider them as such in the motherland . 
  they certainly tried . 
  probably not . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aar1xva.jpg ) is a propaganda poster from back then . 
  it was meant to assure the overseas territories ( and its indigenous people ) they were not simply colonies but a factual part of portugal as a country . 
  that probably would n't work well with hitler . 
  lisbon taxi prices are set as well . 
  that does n't stop some of them from ripping off tourists . 
  occasionally we hear in the news about an arrest as the police tends to approach tourists they saw out of a cab just then and ask what the travel was and how much they paid . 
  if it is not within the expected values , the driver has to justify himself . 
  unfortunately there 's thousands of taxis and they ca n't control them all ... 
  that 's just sort of a bigger pen\u00ednsula . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madre_de_deus the british stole this one ship , and :  the carrack whilst at dartmouth , england was subject to theft on an industrial scale ; it attracted all manner of traders , dealers , cutpurses and thieves from miles around . 
  by the time walter raleigh had restored order , a cargo estimated at half a million pounds ( ** nearly half the size of england 's treasury ** and perhaps the second-largest treasure ever after the ransom of atahualpa ) had been reduced to # 140,000 . 
  i am surprised russians do n't eat actual staples for breakfast . 
  big iron source you see ? 
  this calls for a / r/atheism post . 
   challenge excepted ca n't tell if typo or it 's just no longer a challenge at all ... 
  really ? 
  i think the us anthem is rather bland : / ( sorry americans , it 's just my musical opinion ) . 
  to be honest , it 's likely that each of those boats is an island populated by irritating and unruly irish and british tourists . 
  it 's mostly an english thing . 
  that 's foreign accented brazillian portuguese . 
  the default values for wages make me sad ... 
  that is going to change ( [ source in portuguese ] ( http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/homossexuais-vao-poder-doar-sangue-1705466 ) ) . 
  it will now be only up to sexual activity - if you change partners you wo n't be allowed to donate for six months , to prevent infected blood . 
  it 's a small country , pretty much everyone knows this map and the relative location of most places . 
  how so ? 
  the main issue is that it is global . 
  while some countries may actually mandate their people to follow proper ecolaws , there are so many others that just do n't give a damn and follow whatever money tells them to . 
  it is n't really a debate , it 's just history . 
  and the city of [ \u00c9vora ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/evr.png ) . 
  it 's even possible the country would increase due to the creation of [ portugalicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal ) . 
  long enough for imf to return . 
  there was an azorean airlines ( sata ) bomb threat past weekend too , turns out it was just a note in the bathroom ...
