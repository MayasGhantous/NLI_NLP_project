  well , i have a meeting this morning . 
  if it was n't for you , i 'd be there one hour early . 
  thank you , il marcello . 
  and a jedi . 
  you forgot the jedi . 
  oh the gypsy question is going to have interesting answers . 
  work to live , not live to work , rite ? 
  this might be one of the most american-stereotyped european things i 've seen lately . 
   there is far more scientific value in the engineering behind the balloon than the jump . 
  that goes true for any attempt at showing science to kids . 
  magic tricks based on science have a lot of hidden science into it , but all the kids care about is the magic . 
  and if they 're interested in it , who knows they wo n't follow it ? 
  i do n't get it , people who do this kind of thing should be , at most , given professional help to make sure he 's not just a normal teenager . 
  what exactly is prison going to do ? 
  bring fear to the rest of the population ? 
  i 'll be honest with you : as i lack a complete interest in economics beyond the simple tasks needed for my life , i had never heard the imf saying anything like that until i heard my country 's media say it out loud after [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/1173bo ) other set of news . 
  that being said , do forgive me for posting what you consider old news , but keep in mind that other people may be interested in hearing about it . 
   adding that he had been using the disabled parking spot for three years . 
  that makes it all the better . 
  [ this ] ( http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/documents/curriculum-vitae ) is accepted in most of the european union as far as i know . 
  goddamnit , the title scared me into thinking spain had some nasty new terrorist attacks & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  it is n't , the city is named istanbul . 
  it was constantinople before 1923 , but its official name is indeed istanbul , in turkish or otherwise . 
  even in portuguese :p http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantinople#names, 
  to be honest , we europeans also really only focus on one country . 
  i have little knowledge of the history of eastern and northern europe other than the most obvious things . 
  still , i do have much more than most of my friends , as i have a real liking to history . 
  it is as you say , european history is just overwhelming . 
  besides , each country has its own version of history . 
  american products , european products ... 
  they 're all made in china !, 
  by definition , heat waves are periods of at least 6 days where the temperature is at least 5 c higher than the mean of the last 30 years . 
  i know 5 c sounds weak , but it is n't , specially for the colder countries as the differencep between 10c and 15c is more noticeable than between 35c and 40c . 
  i am no expert in medicine , so i ca n't tell you for sure why people die , but it 's very noticeable they do . 
  while i understand your point , i am confused as to what us sports teams have to do with europe . 
  the englishmen are under that flag already & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  you 're concerned at how every tourist tries to takes pictures of themselves holding it ? 
  darwin did n't go to ` murica , einstein did . 
  i reckon that 's his point . 
   big ben was re-named elizabeth tower on the jubilee . 
  not quite correct : big ben 's the bell , so that 's just a nickname . 
  the tower 's name was renamed that from clock tower , but people will still call it the big ben , really . 
  ` murica < 3, 
  i may have not explained myself well enough : my buddy knows england is in europe , but he thought england was not part of the eu because they did n't adopt the euro . 
  `` haha , james bond in the european union flag , fail '' , he said . 
  that 's funny , because one of the things i 'm puzzled by ` murica is why people actually win cases like `` woman tries to dry baby in microwave and sues company because their instruction booklet did not say anything about the danger of drying your infant in the goddamn microwave '' . 
  no kidding , an american friend said that exact thing to me . 
  after a few seconds , he mentioned `` well , england is n't in the euro is it ? 
  well , what about [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/bruxelles_manneken_pis.jpg ) ? 
  think of the advancements on fluid dynamics !, 
  `` in science in trust '' is just the opposite of `` in god we trust '' . 
  it really is simply satirizing ` murica . 
  needs to be white !, 
  not racist , [ second line ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29 ) . 
  europe ; that 's quite allright . 
  i take it that 's the rotten fish then ? 
  [ sorry , brother ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vfry7/languages_and_dialects_of_europe_with_priotity/ ) . 
  of course it is relative . 
  america is about 3000 miles from coast to coast . 
  europe has about 3000 years of written history ( give or take , heh ) . 
  thus , 100 miles in america seems as little as 100 years in europe . 
  obviously , if you were going by absolute terms , it would n't work ; while those 3000 european years were filled with historical happenings , most of america is pretty darn empty . 
  you are most correct in saying that europe has had more historical events in the last century alone than the whole of north america . 
  that goes without saying , really . 
  keep in mind , however , i did n't say the opposite . 
  what i said is that , while europe had some history ( and i 'll get to this in a moment ) , the us have had more history happening in the last 100 years they 've had since its founding . 
  and despite the many historical events in the 20th century , europe has had at least twenty centuries all completly filled with very rich history . 
  some more , some less , sure , but it still stands . 
  that 's why we could say that 100 years in europe is as much time as 100 km in america is in space : barely anything . 
  well , other than both world wars and a bit of cold war battlefield , what actually has been going with the whole of europe in the last 100 years ? 
  individual countries aside , not much really . 
  i would say that the us have had much more history the last century than they 've had for the entire time they were even building their nation , really . 
  i would think it 's because cities can be different too . 
  american metropolii are often really large , with very big suburbs and a dense , sky-scrapped business center , while european cities are n't so big , but much denser . 
  yes !, 
  i think that 's it . 
  i love that sentence . 
  thanks for reminding me of the correct form . 
  yes , it 's quite impressive how 100km is often enough for a completly different dialect with strange words . 
  as i read once on reddit ( can not recall where ) , in america the span of time is short , but the span of distance is long , while in europe the span of time is long , but the span of distance is short . 
  rest assured , i was not being serious . 
  i guess we trust the eu institutions mostly because they really ca n't be much worse than ours . 
  of course portugal trusts eu , the gorram president is one of ours . 
  we have to cheer for our lads , right ? 
  that 's a funny fact coming from americans . 
   fact : could we invade romania ? 
  i ca n't speak for everyone here , really , but i do n't think we feel like that in portugal . 
  using the portuguese flag makes you a patriot , not a nationalist . 
  come on , denmark , let us be greater than you at something :(, 
  why not ? 
  do we need to fill in paperwork ? 
  i 'd rather think he 's using ` our ' with an indicative connotation rather than its actual possessive meaning . 
  because of no favoritism towards ` murica . 
  i , for one , welcome my scottish overlord . 
  madeira is europe and part of portugal . 
  it is shown as blue if my eyes do n't decieve me ; they could , it is quite small . 
  that is the source of my confusion . 
  so what ? 
  most of the blue lands in the map were also inhabited by people before we got there . 
  why are the azores purple and madeira ( i think ) and greenland blue ?
