  would n't do much about the navy seals though . 
  / r/ru is for the russians . 
  there are several countries with two subreddits , one in english , other in the national language . 
  british humour , how ca n't she ? 
  you forgot to mention the british humour . 
  you really have to learn how to ~ ~ tan ~ ~ sun . 
  also , i fucking love [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mzwkuoxz8 ) video . 
  old chap charles must be hinting at his mother at this very moment . 
  uhm , til that myself . 
  i have n't seen it yet . 
  money just does n't get here :(, 
  i do n't feel that at all . 
  so , now what ? 
  because of the french . 
  damn french . 
  at least here in portugal , there was barely any information regarding those elections . 
  there was some stuff on the news , a few papers here and there , but nothing to even two orders of magnitude downscale of what we have in national elections . 
  i 'd not surprised at all to hear that some people did n't even know there were european elections . 
  poorer people possibly have more time to cook healthy foods , richer people would go for fast foods . 
  heart death , not heat death :p, 
  i wonder how coffee consumption is related with health if we look at another map like [ this ] ( http://factsanddetails.com/media/2/20120527-800px-coffee_consumption_map-en.svg.png ) . 
  ie , moderation vs excess consumption . 
  as i said before , work ethic and coffee . 
  also , i love the name of this molecule , [ oleuropein ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleuropein ) . 
  yeah , lumping the whole of croatia under one colour is a bit strange . 
  would be interesting to see how sea-bordering regions would fare compared to the others . 
  i met a girl from croatia who was studying in lisbon . 
  she said pretty much everything in portugal is better , except the mountains . 
  she was from pula iirc , which is as red as dalmatia . 
  point in case : anecdotes are not evidence . 
  neither is my statement about food a fact , just a statement :p, 
  one of them , probably , but not likely the only one . 
  i 'd wager work culture is also into play , but it 's mostly about stress ( from its various sources ) , i suppose . 
  and booze . 
  it 's the food . 
  depends on the word . 
  it 's an exotic animal from the other side of the world . 
  the kind of thing documentaries are made of , which the british and americans make a lot of . 
  so knowing its name in english really is n't all that surprising . 
  ask me what a swallow , or a sparrow , or a robin , or any absolute typical european bird is , though , and i 'll have to check a dictionary just to be sure we 're talking about the same thing . 
  the thumbnail still looks like the portuguese flag . 
  that we 're lazy . 
  i 'd tell you why it bothers me but i 'm buzy right now . 
  maybe later . 
  hey , not to worry , this is a biased list , for some reason it is based in 2013 , and not in 1513 when it should be . 
  if the editors had n't picked the wrong year , both our countries would likely be in top of the list !, 
  or probably not :(, 
  not us !, 
  i live in a mediterranean country , yet i 've only seen the mare nostrum twice in my life . 
  true . 
  if it 's splattered all over the hair and it 's very noticeable you 're using it , it 's awful . 
  i do n't get the mediterranean reference . 
  edit : i meant the actual mediterranean sea , german reference . 
  i get it now , german tourists go there and piss in the water . 
  nothing wrong with hair gel . 
   okay , i used fluent incorrectly there . 
  adequate to have a proper conversation was more what i was going for . 
  is n't that fluent , precisely ? 
  people are able to speak easily . 
  it does n't mean they 're adept and use big words and expressions , but that the conversation goes smoothly . 
  we 're such lazy people , are n't we ? 
  `` it does n't matter that the vikings took all our hot women , we have sheep to shag ! '', 
  i would like to know as well . 
  mind you , i can somewhat understand it diplomatically , as russia still is a big world player ( although weak at the moment ) , portugal 's diplomacy has been one of ass kissing for the past 300 years , and we seldom had any wrongs with russia ( except siding with the uk in a war , and cutting relations when they 've gone communist and we went fascist ) , but the diplomatic penalties we may get for siding with them against everyone else in europe puzzles me . 
  economically speaking , though , we do n't give a damn . 
  russia has close to nothing in our economy ( and vice-versa of course ) . 
  to be honest i have n't been paying too much attention , but i do n't think i 've yet heard anything about it in portugal . 
   shudras i thought gypsies were untouchables , not shudras . 
  or is there a meaning to that word in romanian ? 
  as is that you have no idea what europe is like . 
  your point being ? 
  i have no idea what native americans from nowadays are like . 
  they 're probably assimilated . 
  again , you 're not providing any sources , you 're just stating your opinion . 
  your mistake was the last sentence . 
  without any sources , you 're just throwing out nonsense . 
  i get that and i think it 's amazing you did all that work , but scene 50 and 51 are the same , unless my times are different than yours . 
  i 'm confused , 50 and 51 ( the times you mentioned at least ) are all the same scene , in lisbon . 
  those are indeed some nice \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 . 
  i quite enjoyed the part where he \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 , haha !, 
  i guess that explains why all british tourists are always red as lobsters around here . 
  you really have no idea how to sun . 
  fuck man , i 've lived in lisbon since birth and for some reason i am now looking at the flag and wondering why the five towers atop the crown are so surprised ... 
  it gives a feeling of wtf is going on here everywhere you look in lisbon !, 
  edit : now i see it [ in ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/lisboa.png ) [ many ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/flag_of_lisbon.png ) [ versions ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/art/countries/portugal-lisbon.gif ) ... 
  okay , second one is just derp . 
  i edited the album with english descriptions , . 
  pictures speak a thousand words indeed , but they were all portuguese . 
  he would better look out for the dutch , then . 
  that 's actually really nice . 
  and the magic tricks too !, 
  i feel ignorant , but til about the [ ringgit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaysian_ringgit ) . 
  cool name . 
  did you not read what i said ? 
  plenty if arkansas had been on the news and on tv for a few months now . 
  you 're right that europeans probably do n't know the location of most us states and most countries in the world , even in europe , which is why saying americans are bad at geography is silly ( although not false , i guess ) . 
  but americans do sound an awful lot worse at keeping up with current world news . 
  haha , yes i did , thanks for the correction . 
  damn right , i do n't understand why he is n't called \u041f\u0443\u0301\u0442\u0438\u043d everywhere . 
  we have words for all those in portuguese .
