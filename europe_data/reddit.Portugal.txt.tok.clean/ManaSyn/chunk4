  what are you talking about ? 
  it 's also shorthand for `` arroba '' . 
  likewise for any other symbol . 
  not even the @ itself . 
  at least the judge was a cool guy . 
  yes . 
  this is even better if you consider how easy it is to control the amount of power you can drain from those dams , just by opening and closing the water valves , as opposed to what happens in coal plants ( or nuclear , which we do not have ) when they malfunction - which effect , by the way , can also be negated by having all that potential energy in the dams . 
  this means we can close gaps in supply rather easily just by opening the dams , and we can restore that energy at night when demand is lower , mostly by just letting the wind blow . 
  them lazy southern europeans ... 
  i do n't know what the fuck you people are drinking , the herald animal should be [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bgtirl2.jpg ) . 
  i dumb . 
  here you go : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21wmpt/if_were_all_eurasians_now/cgh8d7l, 
  putin . 
  he has irish origins . 
  til oil is female . 
  i thought it was a strawberry , with it being based on `` fraise '' in some languages . 
  op is , as always , a retard . 
  a true new canadian !, 
  according to your logic , pluto . 
  if you squat to pay your metro ticket , does n't that count as work instead ? 
  what , this is just about doing exercise , our food is healthy as fuck . 
  if you only learnt that today , you 're a lazy learner . 
  what would be the type of car used ? 
  i think raising our gdp to the power of 3 would help the entire world . 
  edit : although now that i look better , that 's not what you said !, 
  yes , we use it here in portugal . 
  edit : or rather , we do n't use the short one , we say a thousand million euros , for instance . 
  a long billion is something we have n't seen in a while :(, 
  the irony throne . 
  yes , but ... is it 10 ^ 9 or 10 ^ 12 $ ? 
  : / it 's either short scale for being in english , or long scale for being about europe . 
  is that russell 's fedora ? 
  so is this short billion or long billion ? 
  tried to find the eu 's budget to answer myself , but that did n't help . 
  uh , you 're the one who said there 's no risk of disappearing into the night in the us . 
  again , what does that have to do with the internet ? 
  i 'm from lisbon , but i have to show you [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_claimed_to_be_built_on_seven_hills ) . 
  er , it was terribly bad phrasing of my part ... what i tried to say is that , yes , the american and the unflaired guy are only talking about america , while the europeans do mention other countries . 
  i agree with you , this will be about america , really . 
  but so is the article . 
  let 's be fair here , the most upvoted comment is from an american saying exactly that , as the other unflaired dude . 
  the european-flaired users either mentioned both or none at all . 
  what does that have to do with the internet ? 
  which revolutions would those be ? 
   ** you ** should be able to read place names at least . 
  -------  however , cyrillic is very close to greek letters . 
  ** i ** never learned greek , but ** i ** did have to learn the letters as part of high school maths and science . 
  when ** i ** first went to russia , that is all ** i ** had to find my way around the metro . 
  -- sorry , but the only greek i learned was the one required for maths , i have little knowledge of what they actually mean . 
  so do n't go say we can read a bit of cyrillic just because you can . 
  why are you sorry , thank you for the translation !, 
  see , the most exotic place i 've been to is \u6fb3\u9580\u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 , but i would like to go to \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629 , at least once , but i am no muslim so i 'm not even sure i can go there . 
  at least not to the \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0639\u0628\u0629 . 
  because he 's spanish . 
  / r/showerthoughts / r/woahdude, 
  i wonder , are queues in traffic respected in britain ? 
  an english smile .

  if the merit is for dead policemen , why do you expect the virgin mary to be batoning people ? 
  come on , be reasonable !, 
  bouncers . 
  there 's something about that sentence that makes me read that they want excessive force to be agreed by the member states ... 
  i know i 'm wrong , of course , but still ... 
  ukraine is russia 's turf , the eu ca n't just mess with it . 
  this is the set\u00fabal peninsula only , not the district ( nuts iii regions ) . 
  i think this is correct , with the southern suburbs of lisbon and set\u00fabal 's itself . 
  nothing if one understands they are a dangerous tool that should be controlled for the sake of society . 
  that is bloody cold to me !, 
  this is beautiful . 
  we never get anything like that around here . 
  i 'm sure it 's also bloody cold . 
  this was a really stupid question , somehow i misread the title . 
  i am sorry . 
  with no desire to put it down , how do you know it is a student and why would it matter ? 
  young man would suffice , no ? 
  it 's simple , in civ v none of the female leaders is a warmonger . 
  well , maybe wu zetian . 
  why would n't i be , croatian women are gorgeous !, 
  or their girlfriends , apparently . 
  is n't reddit a play on words of ' i read it somewhere ' rather than ' i reedited it ' ? 
  still , close enough .

   golden hoard is that where they keep the dragons ? 
  african-russian ? 
  black driver ? 
  they 're programmers . 
  at first i was a bit sad that the environment worries 0 % of portuguese people . 
  but it kinda makes sense , our policies are decent and our climate is good . 
  the weather is the least of our problems . 
  i do n't think full-time refers to your dedication to it but rather to your availability to fulfill all normal schedules , both for students and employees . 
  but that is a good question , now i am not sure ... 
  what if i am full-time student with part-time employment ? 
  sure , volkswagen means the car of the people !, 
  your word for orange , portakal , is closer to the country 's name than the actual country 's name !, 
   and the name suggests construction materials , something like a mix of `` brita '' ( gravel ) or `` saibro '' ( a poor and ancient form of cement ) . 
  as a portuguese ... what ?
