  we 're not . 
  what job ? 
  heh , i actually feel sorry for the anti-americanism that goes on this thread , and i hope you do n't think ill of us all because of it . 
  but believing the us goes to war for righteous reasons is just being naive , sorry . 
  it 's not just the oil , mind you , you have to keep your entire military and construction industries active , too . 
  that 's a not a bold claim , really . 
  portugal is there , where the king is a puppet of the [ duke of saldanha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jo%c3%a3o_carlos_saldanha_de_oliveira_daun,_1st_duke_of_saldanha ) . 
  but to be honest , at first i read britannia in the man 's hat . 
  would still make sense . 
  pretty much the same in portugal too . 
  but these are just labels to help the survey , who gives a shit about it other than that ? 
   agnostic means `` do n't give a damn '' , right ? 
  not at all . 
  agnostic means that you do n't believe something can be proven to be either true or false . 
  it can be related to deities , sure , but just as much as it can be related to singularities in the universe or wether reality shows are real or fake . 
  maybe i 'm just being too picky . 
  gnosticism is n't religion , it 's about being able to prove something . 
  message still goes trough in the survey anyway . 
  i wish you did n't put agnostic as a religious belief , but i understand it 's easier to do so . 
  edit : also , the ones about the us are going to be pretty to look at . 
  so what you are saying is that the swiss can not use the alps because they have seldom been invaded ? 
   plus : so you sit in your mountain hole while the enemy loots your cities and rapes your families . 
  then he starts rebuilding the country while you still sit there , watching your supplies run low . 
  great idea . 
  for what it is worth , the moors had some troubles in handling the asturian mountain range upon their complete conquest of the iberian peninsula , and guess [ what happened then ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) . 
  but sure , medieval warfare versus modern warfare is n't really comparable . 
  i mean , there are airplanes , missiles , and whatnot . 
  it 's evident that mountains are no longer sufficient for an occupied people to do much about it , but if you look at the taliban and the afghanistan mountains , it can hurt the occupant . 
  * it is a confederation , divided into cantons . 
  * neutral in almost every european war there was ( and we 've had a lot ) , they have conscription , which means every men in the whole country would be able to fight if necessary . 
  that , and the alps , make it a goddamn fortress . 
  oh , and tanks in barns , too . 
  * the alps . 
  beautiful , beautiful , the best natural landscapes i 've seen in my travels . 
  * clockwork . 
  both the people and the actual clocks . 
  * swiss army knives , of course ( i wonder if the papal guard uses swiss army partisans ) . 
  * chocolates and cheese . 
  * cern . 
  * banks . 
  edit : pope guard uses partisans , not halberds . 
  to put it this way , it generally is n't tipping for good service that is frowned upon ; only when you try to put a price in simpathy can it be weird . 
  that said , tipping in restaurants is generally accepted , and the population is mostly divided . 
  i do n't usually tip , i know people who do . 
  so , it 's fine to tip a waiter , really . 
  so did you enjoy the francesinha ? 
  hah , rediscovering !, 
  i like you . 
  i think people often mistake it . 
  portugal is n't the oldest country , but it has the oldest ( not sure ) borders in the world . 
  continental borders have not changed since somewhere about the 14th century or so . 
   no heating in houses while true in the south , where the houses are painted white to help reflect sunlight in the summer , northern houses such as [ this ] ( http://ipt.olhares.com/data/big/130/1301742.jpg ) often had a barn on the ground level where people would place the cattle for the night which would , in turn , heat up the first floor , where people slept , from animal heat and a good fireplace . 
  how so ? 
  what does it mean in german ? 
  i was trying to point out that even if it does gets colder , the magnitude we 're talking about is one or , at most , two degree celsius . 
  that is , even if the summer is colder , it wo n't be cold . 
  so do n't worry , you 'll get 34 instead of 35 degrees !, 
  right , i missed the suspension part . 
  where did you get this list ? 
  because / u/jsn86 is correct , the big one is n't 25 de abril . 
  as far as food goes , what mostly matters is the climate , and we have [ mediterranean climate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate ) . 
  of course , however , as / u/oidaoyduh pointed out , we also have a lot of influence from our colonies . 
  most of us really do n't like getting extra money for being helpful . 
  doing something like that is already very rewarding for us . 
  for example , one night out , my sister lost her purse . 
  the following day , some girl called me ( as it had her cellphone in it ) and , after some arrangements , we met somewhere so she 'd give her the purse . 
  it had everything in it , nothing was gone , and my sister tried to give her some euros to pay for the gas she spent , but she vehemently refused it . 
  and we did n't insist , because that 's just how it works . 
  it can actually be insulting to be given money for being friendly , but we generally disregard that as just a `` he did n't know better '' thing . 
   used to be fascist , got rid of the dictator using carnation flowers haha , if you put it that way it sounds like an amazing conversation theme !, 
  `` so how did that go , he was emotionally touched by a bouquet of flowers or what ?! '', 
  i guess ` the ' is n't a good word to use there ? 
  i 'd like to point out that this is n't true . 
  there are some probabilities that the weather will be less than one degree celsius colder , but climatologic predictions can not be taken as precise . 
  we 're still in spring , and the temperatures are reaching almost 30 \u00b0 c in some places . 
  nevertheless , we are currently experiencing several semi-periodic polar fronts ( cold ) which explains why sometimes temperature goes down by almost 10 \u00b0 c. 
  we 'll be getting another one of those northern buggers next week , too . 
   the latest seasonal forecast of the portuguese institute of sea and atmosphere ( ipma ) , released on the 17th of may , speaks of values that can be between 0.2 and 0.5 degrees celsius below average across the mainland , between june and august . 
  if the accounting period is from july to september , the fall in temperature applies only to north and centre of the country . 
  in [ this article ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publico.pt%2fecosfera%2fnoticia%2fproximo-verao-podera-ser-mais-frio-em-portugal-1595762 ) . 
  estonia can into nordic ? 
  unfortunately , [ this ] ( http://franciscosoeiroblender.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/111.jpg ) is awful to walk on , specially on rainy days , because you slip all the time . 
  also , since they are all manually built , they 're not very levelled , and you get quite the bumpy ride one step to another . 
  i understand muslims were also targeted by the holocaust , but what exactly is there to offend them ? 
  yes , i was really surprised at that map that showed google maps coverage of europe , and germany was also very much uncovered . 
  it seems you germans really do not like communication technology . 
  not entirely correct , but very close . 
  the land is rising because the isostatic balance of the lithosphere has not yet been restored since the last ice age . 
  it 's not that the land is compressed like , say , a sponge , but the weight of the ice pushed the land downward and the mantle has not yet fully raised it back . 
  in other words , a wooden boat being pushed down and coming back to the surface , on a geological time scale . 
   threat customers better than us youth problems ? 
  they dine really early . 
  and like rotten fish . 
  and there 's an awful lot of them on the internet indeed . 
  i do n't really know much about its history , because it was never relevant to my own country 's history , but i know it is a most beautiful place i would very much like to visit , and that it ( or , well , scandinavia as a whole ) is one of the few places on earth the sea level is falling . 
   false friends did not know what that was called . 
  [ til ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friend ) . 
  [ on the other hand ... ] ( http://news.asiantown.net/r/29948/swedish-man-di--101-s-after-se--120--with-wasp-nest ), 
  i do n't have anything interesting to say ; the map looks like the portuguese flag . 
  what exactly is the sick man label ?
