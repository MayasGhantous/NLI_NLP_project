  no , i do n't believe being ( more ) raped in the ass will solve our crisis or help unemployment or help anyone but greedy bosses ( and you know very well that portugal is full of wise-guys that try to take advantage of the system as best as they can ) . 
  regulation is necessary in employment or the employers would take total advantage of you . 
  what would it matter if you had a job but you were only paid enough to survive ? 
  that would be degrading and would n't boost the economy at all . 
  i bet you speak with a full belly . 
  no , the circle jerk is really on the threads related to this incident where redditors are desperately trying to identify `` suspects '' . 
  mob justice is n't justice . 
  it disgusts me . 
  these people do n't know or accept the reality of our country and others like it . 
  you should also keep in mind that household income means the income from everyone in that household . 
  people in northern countries leave their parent 's house earlier ( because they have more money ) . 
  i only provide anecdotal evidence but , to be honest , judging from the people i know in my country and the german people i know , i find this hard to believe . 
   sand in your genitals sex in hard mode, 
   all this is something that is increasingly been seen here in portuga except we do n't have a thatcher here , or anyone even remotely close ... 
  so , [ us and them ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcg47cpsu6c ) . 
  all these continents are yours except europe . 
  attempt no landing there . 
  iirc bsd ( 4.2 bsd ) was supposed to be what linux is today but due to license issues , linux was the one used for all the gnu software . 
  i would n't ago as far as saying microsoft stiffled innovation , they just managed to have a monopoly on general purpose desktop oss for a few years ( other oss were used at the time for more specific tasks ) . 
  ironically , the year of the linux desktop , which was a common meme in / . , came onto realization under the form of ` the year of linux in the smartphone ' . 
   that argument makes no sense , the vast majority of the people earn higher than the minimum wage . 
  once again , you 're portuguese so you should know this : do n't trust the cooked up numbers and statistics you see the state throwing about . 
  you know very well this is n't the case - the majority probably earns little more than the minimum wage , believe me . 
   that 's silly , people are `` greedy '' everywhere , it 's human nature to try and pursue what 's best for the individual . 
  it 's not a bad thing , anyone can ( or should be able to - we have plenty of restrictive regulate ) become an employer and employers ca n't just `` take advantage '' because they 're dependent on the employees to fulfil a bilateral contract . 
  again , you 're portuguese so you probably know how this works over here : you are mostly powerless . 
  the justice system is inefficient and prone to hand greasing . 
  you 're just a little man being abused by the big corrupt man , unless you start being corrupt too , which many do . 
  do you think the people who worked in a fab which conveniently was `` burnt down '' right before the company declared bankruptcy will ever see their 3 months delay in salaries ? 
  `` oh , but they should have gone to the correct authorities to help them get their money back ! '', 
  do you really think that would work ? 
  `` oh , but they should have left their job as soon as the shit started hitting the industrial fans ! '', 
  and go where ? 
  what job ? 
  you do n't get unemployment fund if you quit yourself . 
  it all works perfectly in the correct cultures , but not in our culture . 
  knucle-headed bosses would take advantage of the absence of minimum wage ( shit , they already do with recibos verdes ) . 
  no , this would n't benefit portugal the slightest . 
  it could create more jobs but what 's the point of working if you ca n't even feed yourself ? 
  i mean , portugal 's minimum wage is already a joke because you ca n't possibly live by it if you happen to live in a biggish city . 
  sorry but no . 
  portugal 's problems are much deeper than simply having a minimum wage . 
  we should start by cleansing the political and banking filth elite and then start opening people 's minds to another type of culture . 
  that wo n't happen , sadly . 
  speaking of ancient rituals , [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0szoz8lxda ) [ spoiler alert ] from ` the wicker man ' always gets to me . 
  highly recommended thriller on that subject as well . 
  you 're portuguese so you know very well that if there was no minimum wage in portugal , bosses would just take advantage of it . 
  the absence of minimum wage makes sense but only in a responsible culture . 
  most countries in europe are n't responsible or serious/honest . 
  me too ( it 's sunny here ) . 
  off-topic : please do n't use the piigs term . 
  thank you . 
  usa exports freedom . 
  mutual assured destruction ? 
  yes , people want change but most are powerless : the whole political elite is corrupt . 
  dont talk about what you dont know . 
   how much a country makes is directly correlated with standard of living and how developed the country is . 
  what ? 
   haha you sound like my dad . 
  the us does n't have many portuguese except on the upper east coast . 
  sadly most are from the azores so they are very dumb and not adaptable ( no offense ) makes me feel embrassed to be portuguese here . 
  get lumped into dumb and ignorant people . 
  with this kind of talk you 're not doing much to improve the stereotype other countries ( you know , besides the kingdom of uncle sam ) have of you : ignorant and arrogant bastards . 
   i do agree portuguese people are hard working , seems to be part of their nature . 
  the only thing that bothers me and i am going to generalize is that many still do very simple jobs , construction , cleaning etc. 
  and that gives them a bad connotation in the us and probably europe this is something that 's inherently wrong with many societies . 
  one 's social status should not be tied to the nature of one 's job and further more , construction jobs , cleaning jobs and the like are very important jobs . 
  and the only ones that say they are `` simple jobs '' are the ones who never worked a day in their lives . 
  secondly , the current wave of immigrants are people with degrees . 
   'm sure there are plenty of super educated people now in my age group ( 20s ) but , they do n't get represented very much . 
  anytime i see any news from portugal it 's always talking about someone in a village or a small town talking about how life is hard , crops are down and otehr stuff i have no interest in . 
  easy - stop watching fox news . 
   i know portugal is the least developed of europe what ? 
  god , you 're so fucking american !, 
  are you that fucking dense ? 
  as it was explained by vayl , you are n't dumb because you have lusitanian blood in your vains , you 're dumb because you are fucking dumb . 
  there wo n't be any prejudice against you , you can have my word on that . 
  oh , and try to get a bit more educated , americano . 
  * sigh * i literally do n't know anyone who works less than 8 hours per day ( anecdotal evidence i know , but in the countries where siesta is legal [ like spain for instance ] they still work 8 hours per day ) . 
  latino culture ? 
  what are you even referring to ? 
  we 're portuguese , not `` latinos '' as you so ignorantly put it . 
  people here in / r/europe are showing how little they know their european neighbours . 
  alabama ? 
  wtf ? 
  you 're talking out of your arse , you obviously do n't know anything at all about portugal . 
  what 's wrong with being a multicultural , gay friendly place in the first place ? 
  you do realize we had many african colonies ? 
  wait , you do n't , because you 're an ignorant asshole . 
  i admit we have a lot of bureaucracy - this is tied in with the usual corruption/lobby schemes , as per the rest of southern europe . 
  sorry for breaking it for you but , most of europe was a catholic nation for many centuries . 
  seriously , inform yourself before writing embarrassing posts like that . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  the portuguese situation is much similar to other southern european countries ( spain , italy , greece , croatia , etc. . . ) . 
  portugal is very european , trust me . 
  no , portugal wo n't be the mexico of europe and yes , you are a fucking ignorant americano da merda .
