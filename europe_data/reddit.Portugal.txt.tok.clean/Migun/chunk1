thanks for sharing that , it made me smile :d !, 
  in portugal usually you round up the bill , or leave 1 euro ( more it is rare ) . 
  [ we have tolls in portugal ] ( http://pplware.sapo.pt/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/portagens_000.jpg ) that only residents pay . 
  or better , if people from other countries want to pay , first they have to rent a device that is used for electronic toll collection , and since ( almost ) no one does that , no one pays . 
  [ now they are trying to collect debts from about 300.000 people in spain .

  it 's not my favourite ( i do n't have `` one '' ) , but one of my favourites . 
  [ sarrabulho ] ( http://www.cm-pontedelima.pt/imagens/noticias/janeiro2010/sarrabulho_amandio.jpg ) it does not look good , but believe me , it is !, 
   southern people make fun of porto man , every day i listen to this kind of jokes , and i 'm not even from porto . 
  after a while its tiresome :| . 
  its the same for the razor in portugal , we say `` gilete '' .

  low income combined with high taxes ? 
  oh , thanks for the correction !, 
  it 's summer , it will be higher in portugal during autumn and winter ( but i hope i 'm wrong ) . 
  i want to believe that no one is that blind and egotistical . 
  if for portugal that includes the vacation and christmas salary ( double salary in june and november , or 14 yearly salaries ) , its even worse :| . 
  i see that the [ fiat pendolino ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pendolino ) is a popular choice in europe . 
  well , the answer in portugal is simple , we went from b-segment cars with 1.0 / 1.2 l gasoline engines , to c-segment with 1.5 / 1.6 l diesel engines . 
  the [ portuguese discoveries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_discoveries ) in the 15th and 16th centuries . 
  edit : oops , guess that someone said it before me  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2coayb/reurope_whats_generally_considred_to_have_been/cjhfumm, 
  we have [ double decker ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5053/5479964012_608421b5be_z.jpg ) buses in porto , we also had some powered by hydrogen , but i think we do n't have them anymore . 
  one is in magikland ( the old bracalandia ) . 
  in portugal , for those same 3000 euros ( the few that earn that ) , you see 1768 euros . 
  here the vat is 23 % ( next year it will be 23,25 % ), 
  what region do you live ? 
  i never saw this kind of case being used on food , only in some electronics . 
  month . 
  in portugal we have pensions that are between 200/300 $ . 
  ca n't the algerian gas pipeline be used ? 
  i know that portugal , spain and italy use it . 
   to a swiss court `` foreign pig '' is not a racist insult \u2260  a swiss court ruled , on friday , ** calling someone else `` foreign pig '' or `` dirty asylum seeker '' is an insult ** , but does not violate the anti-racism law in switzerland . 
  it is an insult , but did not violate the anti-racism law in switzerland . 
  oh , i do n't doubt you , but it is difficult to spend that little . 
  thankfully i do n't spend that much on lunch ( about 0.85 / 1.75 $ depends on what i eat , it 's this cheap because the company where i work pays for the rest ) . 
  how can you spend so little ? 
  average lunch is about 4/5 $ per day , and i spend more than 100 $ per month in groceries for me only ( and my mother gives me some vegetables ) . 
  it 's `` reino unido '' ( kingdom = reino ; united = unido ) . 
  in my circle of family , work colleagues and friends , reino unido . 
  the correct name for holland should be `` pa\u00edses baixos '' , although `` no one '' says that . 
  i have no idea , i think that is probably because blond children are minority and different from the usual brown/dark hair . 
  when i was a child , older people would tell me to be cautious when near roma people , because they would kidnap blonde children ( and blond children are not usual in portugal ) . 
  i would never believe this could be true , guess there is a little of truth in every `` myth '' . 
  he wo n't give up so easily . 
  paulo portas talked to him after the finance minister quit , he said that he did not agree with him for the new finance minister , passos ignored and did what he wanted instead of trying to reach to a compromise . 
  because of his actions yesterday , i believe he wo n't do it . 
  serebro , from russia [ serebro - angel kiss ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzozite0pc8 ) [ serebro - gun ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwkl-ng084u ) you do n't see any `` nudity '' , but in the second video you can see a nipple ( barely ) . 
  i guess if it is at a caf\u00e9 / snack bar , and you are friends to those who work there ( like in small town ) , i can imagine that . 
  never saw a person snap his fingers to call the waiter , like others said , it is a bit rude . 
  normally people just raise the arm . 
  they are every 10 years in portugal . 
  i 'm happy that you liked it  !, 
  galiza is similar to minho indeed , i would like to know if in other border regions it is + / - the same . 
  no , minho ( braga district , to be more precise ) !, 
  if that means about 25\u00bac for the summer season , i am all for it ( typical summers where i live means more than 30\u00bac , sometimes 40\u00bac ) . 
  two have a part-time job at the supermarket , me and another got a job in lisbon , so we will move to there and start working in july . 
  all 4 with degrees ( it ) . 
  in portugal it is normal to use europass , at least i was taught to use it in high school , and i have seen friends and colleagues do the same . 
  but i know this is not the norm in eu . 
  this year they are trying to tax 0.02 $ for up to 1tb , and 0.005 after 1tb . 
  they are trying to do + / - the same here in portugal , but the money is to the portuguese society of authors . 
  the portuguese society of authors are lobbying to tax every device with memory ( smartphones , tablets , computers , hard drives , memory cards , etc ) . 
  last year they wanted to tax external drives 0,025 $ por gb ( ssd or hard drives ) , and 0.5 $ per gb in smartphones and tablets . 
  yup , when listened to , it sounds like portuguese with spanish accent !, 
  nice to see they are making it in europe again ( if i am not mistaken ) , last time i bought something in springfield ( 1 or 2 years ago ) , it was made in pakistan . 
  i have seen it in some clothing . 
  edit : went to see it , all clothing with `` made in e.u '' that i have is from a portuguese brand called `` decenio '' , and it is made here in portugal . 
  in many tourist places in southern europe ( like south of spain/portugal , mallorca islands , etc ) , the majority of tourists are from the uk , so you may have some luck if you only speak english . 
   are n't you a part of spain ? 
  i want to believe that this is an urban myth , because everyone thinks that many americans think that , but i never knew one ( or someone who knew someone ) who was that ignorant . 
  the same thing can also be said about other countries ( about favouring national companies ) , ca n't talk about the superiority ( i have my own opinion about the superiority image of certain countries , but since i never visited them ( or met only one or other people from that country ) , i should not say them ) . 
  thanks for the opinion !, 
  please do n't generalize germany , that 's the same mistake `` everyone '' does about southern europe . 
  but if you do , i ask you to show me something about how corrupt they are ( because , as you know the general opinion of germany , is that they are hard workers ) . 
  mario soares , the man who asked for imf help in the past !!, 
  i would want to know his opinion if someone from his dear party was the prime minister . 
  [ and from the 26 of march , to 2 of april , almost 100 % of the energy came from renewable .

  [ here is a picture comparison ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/303326_589425104401402_155594098_n.jpg ) between the beginning of april ( 2012 and 2013 ), 
  why must `` everyone '' misspell portug ** u ** ese :| . 
  could you also explain how is federal law imposed , when the state law says otherwise ? 
  i have seen in the past , some medicinal dispensaries being raided by the dea , does that mean that federal agencies only target sellers ? 
  again , thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  you say that in most states it is probably only a fine , so in some states it is possible to stay in prison for the night ( plus the fine ) or even worse ? 
  in us , if someone is caught smoking cannabis in 3 different occasions = life in prison ? 
  i remembered vitorino de almeida later , and kawakai mentioned hugo almeida . 
  but yeah , i am not kidding . 
  yeah , i from north too ( between porto and braga ) . 
  i do n't know one person called `` almeida '' within my family/friends/colleagues . 
  can it be a regional thing ? 
  the only almeida i know , is [ this ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021835/ ) . 
  we had a settlement called cale , near the douro river and the sea .
