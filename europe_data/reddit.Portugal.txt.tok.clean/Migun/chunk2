  when the romans took the iberian peninsula , when they conquered cale , they renamed it to portus cale ( the port of cale ) . 
  the region then got known by the name of that settlement throughtout the years , and became known as portucale , that evolved to portugale . 
  portus is also the origin of the name of porto ( city ) , that gave the name to the port wine . 
  [ more info in wikipedia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_portugal#etymology ) in some languages , portugal also means `` orange '' . 
  i agree with you , [ lte is n't even 4g ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4g#3gpp_long_term_evolution_.28lte.29 ) ( but lte advanced is ) . 
  i am thankful that here in portugal we only dub movies targeted for children ( and even in this case , we have both dubbed and with subtitles ) . 
   the fourteen-year-old daughter was cuddling with and kissing the father maybe i am weird , but i do n't see nothing out of the ordinary in displaying affection . 
  i 'm 26 and i do n't feel ashamed to kiss my mother ( in the cheek ) in public , and my cousin ( 1 year younger ) is the same with his mother . 
  it seems like in spain is like here in portugal . 
  whenever a baby or child says hi or waves to me , i wave and say hi to him , and that is normal . 
  the parents normally do n't say a thing ( at least , they just smile or ignore ) . 
  it makes me sad to know that this is not the normal behaviour . 
  edit : typo fix, 
  i believe this is not 52 % saying `` i would like the uk to exit from the eu '' , but more 52 % saying '' you are always threatening to leave , so stop threatening and leave !! '', 
  it makes sense , thanks !,

  could someone please tell me why american corporations go to ireland ( honest question ) ? 
  i have heard in the past that it is about taxes , but it ca n't be only that ( can it ? ), 
  other than that , congrats ireland !, 
  yup , and with the unemployment crysis , that is happening more often ( people who left their parents home , and returned years later ) . 
  i ca n't speak for the whole country , but the cases that i speak are from the regions that i know ( porto and braga districts ) . 
  unfortunately , i know married people whose parents sometimes do their dinner ( and take it to eat in their home ) , and that also wash their clothes . 
  and they even think that is an `` obligation '' . 
  that is something i do not understand . 
  maybe they are not the same thing , sometimes its more expensive to go to a motel here , than to a 3 or 4 * hotel . 
  motels here , every room has a theme , some have a private pool , and in some motels , every room has a private garage for the car . 
  the thinking here is `` why spent money living in other place , when i have free food and clean clothes ? '', 
  ( and parents do n't incentive in leaving ) , that is why we motels when we need some `` privacy '' . 
   in the portuguese language , `` motel '' ( plural : `` mot\u00e9is '' ) commonly refers not to the original drive-up accommodation house for motorists but to an `` adult motel '' or love hotel with amenities such as jacuzzi baths , in-room pornography , candles and oversize or non-standard-shaped beds in various honeymoon-suite styles . 
  these rooms are available for as little as four hours , and minors are excluded from these establishments . 
  where i live , a son `` only '' leaves the parents house when he goes to work far from home , or when he/she founds a partner to live with ( but in my zone , it 's normally only when someone gets married ) . 
  i do n't remember anyone who is single and lives outside his parents home ( the same with my friends ) . 
  all with between 20 and 30 years old . 
  never heard about `` gente da minha terra '' ( it 's on a cable tv only ) , went to see it , and the guy tries too hard to be funny . 
  for those like me , who do n't have cable  [ gente da minha terra ] ( http://sicradical.sapo.pt/programas/gente-da-minha-terra-europa/ ) on the other hand , `` portugueses pelo mundo '' is a good show , especially to see the differences to portugal . 
  as far as i know , sugar . 
  unfortunately it is a common mistake ( even in games , like in black ops 2 they speak portuguese-brazilian in angola , and the same in the portuguese neighbourhoods of new jersey in gta iv ) , i may be wrong but i think it happens the same with spanish . 
  you should go up north next time , algarve does not have many historical things to see . 
  maybe ireland should use licence plates like in portugal , here the plates say the month and year of buying . 
  it would be a different story if madeira island was in the map ( or so they want the continentals to think that ) . 
  this should say something [ portuguese friends !, 
  why women in this country are like that ? 
  any by `` that '' i mean really hard to reach on various levels . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/147wpm/portuguese_friends_why_women_in_this_country_are/ ), 
  as far as i know , that accent is `` only '' in the s.miguel island . 
  i have the idea that `` avecs '' are portuguese emigrants who work in france , but when in portugal , they only speak in french and treat others like they were superior to everyone . 
  yes , even yesterday i saw that !, 
   why would it be such a madness ? 
  my guess would be economic reasons . 
  for me galician sounds similar to portuguese spoken with `` spanish '' accent  !, 
  portuguese are `` only '' catholic for baptism , marriage and funeral . 
  one hundred thousand escudos , but no one would say that , the majority used the `` contos '' for values bigger in the thousands , 1000 escudos was 1 conto . 
  you can see the production numbers [ here ] ( http://www.autoinforma.pt/producao-automovel-em-portugal.html?mit=1 ) . 
  the factories names are : * vw and seat factory is the `` volkswagen autoeuropa '' * citroen and peugeot is `` psa peugeot citroen mangualde '' * toyota is the `` toyota caetano portugal ovar '' , * mitsubishi is `` fuso trucks portugal '' . 
  in portugal you have the seat alhambra , vw sharan , vw sciroco , vw eos , citroen berlingo , peugeot partner , toyota dyna , toyota hiace , toyota land cruiser ( i do n't know if this one already started ) and mitsubishi canter . 
  we also build some buses . 
  here is the june ranking . 
  peugeot 1 . 
  bmw 1 . 
  mercedes-benz 1 . 
  audi 1 . 
  fiat vw is in second , but last month was in third , renault always sells more .

  where ( region ) are you living ? 
  in lisbon i 've seen some , even in porto . 
  its so nice going to galiza and talk in portuguese and they in galego , and everyone can understand eachother . 
  when my parents tried to to that in barcelona , they received an `` i do n't understand italian '' , ahaha !, 
  you 're right , the suburban trains in porto are `` new '' , but in the cascais line the trains are very very old ( i think older than the regional trains , that are also very old ) . 
  but the worst thing are all the strikes throughout the year . 
  it was n't , i still see it in the frontpage . 
  in a very simple way , its the investigation branch of the police . 
  went to the s\u00e3o miguel island last spring , i loved it so much that i ca n't wait to return and see the rest of the islands ( mainly flores ) . 
  around the new year saw on tv some reporters asking tourists why they chose portugal to spend the new years , several said it was because they felt it was a safe country to be in . 
   always complaining , are somewhat pessimistic welcome to portugal !, 
  yes it 's mandatory by law . 
  one is for the summer holidays and the other for christmas . 
  as much as i love snow , i still prefer my sunny 22\u00bac from portugal ( it should be colder , but i am not complaining !,

   what is the difference between angola and portugal ( apart from the fact one is african and the other european ) ? 
  portugal is under the dead hand of the eu and the euro . 
  well for starters , one is a third world country and the other a developed one . 
  the same in portuguese ( filhos da puta ) . 
   ** portugal cuts budget deficit to lowest level in 4 decades **  lisbon , portugal -- portugal 's government has proved its critics wrong , slashing the debt-heavy country 's budget deficit to its lowest level in more than 40 years despite warnings that its anti-austerity policies could spell financial disaster . 
   finance minister mario centeno said wednesday the deficit last year was no higher than 2.1 percent -- well within the 2.5 percent ceiling stipulated by european authorities . 
   some other eurozone countries expressed alarm when the center-left socialist government , with the support of the communist party and left bloc , took power in 2015 on an anti-austerity platform . 
   portugal needed a 78-billion euro ( $ 82 billion ) bailout in 2011 , after recording a deficit of more than 11 percent the previous year , and eurozone officials feared it could go into another debt spiral under the socialists .

  if it comes from the ctt ( the national post office ) yes , but if it comes from ups , dhl , fedex or others , it is guaranteed it will stop . 
  nowadays chinese sites send to an intermediary country for it not to stop at the customs ( for me it happened coming from the netherlands without the china address ) . 
   last week i 've received a powerbank from china worth $ 30 . 
  i did n't have to pay any extra fees because they marked it as a gift . 
  yeah , that does not work in portugal , they open the package in the customs , and if it appears to have a higher value than the one it was declared , the customs office will ask for the payment receipt to prove the price .
