yeah i got it now . 
  i learnt a lot . 
  i see , its odd why they are isolated in the middle of indo-european languages speaking countries, 
  the only word i remember while being in budapest was utca . 
  can someone explain to me why hungarian is so different from other european languages ? 
  you can also say the less known word ` oiro ' in portuguese . 
  i think so , at least the people i know do . 
  ive knew people from brazil and they used words like ` travesseiro ' instead . 
  they dont use many words starting with - al, 
  brazilians are using the word ` almofada ' , i 'm impressed . 
  for those interested in the portuguese picture . 
  you can actually hike through 30km of abandoned railway that follows the river douro [ from pocinho to barca d'alva ] and then you can do more 17km into spain in a hiking full of tunnels and bridges known as ` rota dos tuneis ' picture : http://i.imgur.com/wvnl4ym.jpg [ oc ], 
  nothing , i just wanted to emphasis the city that way !, 
  because its a fking nice city . 
  buda fking pest, 
  everybody knows people learn finish only because of metal bands, 
  put a pagan ` priest ' to bless all the food in the name of odin ... migration problem solved . 
  i did n't like visiting vienna , so boring . 
   ugly housing estates on the periphery . 
  haha , i was staying in chodov when i visited prague . 
  that 's so true . 
  yeah , i didnt understand kofola in czech republic nor almdudler in austria . 
  when i visited krakow , the city looked really dark to me . 
  i do n't know why but i felt impending doom there . 
  you germans really hate that place ( its more like a folly than a castle i agree ) , when i was in munich the people i spoke to always tried to convince me out of visiting it . 
  rota dos tuneis [ barca d'alva ( portugal ) -  la fregeneda ( spain ) ] ( 18km ) which is an abandoned rail line with lots of tunnels and bridges , if you want more length there is an extra 30km of abandoned rail that goes alongside river douro where the port wine vineyards are located [ pocinho -  barca d'alva ] . 
  when i visited krakow i felt that something was off , now i know why . 
  best : * easy public transportation . 
  the metro was n't packed like in many european cities * the food was awesome . 
  * very familiar town , i really felt at home there . 
  * you never run out of towers , just stay out from the expensive tower of st vitus . 
  worst : * very old public transportation ticket machines that only accept coins , coming from the airport with a big note was n't fun . 
  * lots of tourist traps , you pay too much for small places . 
  i visited the huge munich residenz and it was almost the same price of some small places in prague . 
  st vitus all-included was the biggest ripoff i ever seen . 
  * i was staying in chodov ... well i felt like i was in a completely different city , full of commie blocks . 
  only the center is beautiful . 
  * for a tourist city ... there are n't many english signs . 
  finally, 
  there is a doctor who episode like that, 
  its station club all over again, 
  my favorite city too . 
  i wan na come back so much . 
  is at times like this that i 'm glad that i live in portugal , they never heard that this country exists . 
  so jealous . 
  i will not die before i see the northern lights . 
  its cool if you want to do a round trip in the sintra mountain , but being stuck in traffic with lanes that ca n't handle two ways of traffic sucks and parking is paid on saturdays . 
  at least - mente is common in portuguese adverbs, 
  in portugal calouste gulbenkian is also very well known . 
  even my neighbourhoud has that name . 
  for curiosity : we say that the dogs ' barking sound is ' \u00e3o \u00e3o \u00e3o ' . 
  i used to have couchsurfers in my house , so i explained them to pronunce those sounds by saying the vowels only using the nose and to start with french nasal vowels like in ' - am ' and some of them almost got it . 
   \u00f4 portuguese \u00f4 is very easy . 
  in portugal foreign people usually have difficulty with our ` rr ' and the ' \u00e3o ' / ' \u00f5e ' / ' \u00e3e ' . 
  although if you know how to speak know french it becomes easier . 
  it also happens in portuguese . 
  if you see lots of diphthongs and even triphthongs , it might be portuguese . 
  each syllable must contain a vowel in portuguese , although some of the ` e ' are silent if you speak quickly . 
  example of words with 3 vowels together : ` averiguei ' , ` candeeiro ', 
  i think czech impossible to pronounce ' \u0159 ' is enough xd, 
  i wish english as a germanic language would sound more close to those languages so learning them would be easier . 
  but english got different roots and its very influenced by latin :(, 
  pretty sure in portugal every city has a ` rua do com\u00e9rcio ' ( trade street ) , ` rua direita ' ( right street ) , ` rua 25 de abril ' ... 
  maybe you speak brazilian portuguese ? 
  they do n't have that feature . 
  your sentence is written in bp . 
  if you speek fast you dont say the [ z ] the capital city lisboa , we say it like li [ zh ] boa . 
  the rule is : in european portuguese if the next consonant is voiced ( b , d , \u0261 , v , z ) it sounds like [ zh ] , if its voiceless ( p , t , k , f , s ) it sounds like [ sh ] . 
  the 's ' that ends syllables/words have those sounds , one or another depending if the next consonant is voiced or voiceless . 
  like ` estou ' = ` e [ sh ] tou ' this is one of the reasons people confuse portuguese with russian . 
  that consonants are also very common in portuguese unlike other latin languages , other letters that can have those sounds if i 'm not mistaken zh ( j , g , x , s , z ) and sh ( ch , x , s , z ) . 
  for example if you speak quickly ` fostes ' it becames fo [ sh ] t [ sh ], 
  i learnt that from system of a down xd, 
  in portuguese , there are a few words with those letters next to each other but they are in separate syllables like ` rijo ' , so it does n't count . 
  but j has a zh sound like the 's ' in measure . 
  very old portuguese surnames also end in - ez , but nowadays they end in - es , like marques , fernandes ... 
  in portuguese 's ' does the job just fine , it covers s , z , sh and zh sounds xd . 
  although there are more letters with those sounds . 
  wow that 's a lot of 's ' . 
  portuguese has also lots of words ending in s too that are n't plural forms . 
  but as far names are concerned , most end in - a ( feminine ) or - o ( masculine ) . 
  i think ive seen \u010d and \u017e in some eastern european countries . 
  are they for the sh , tsh , zh sounds ? 
  interesting . 
  did n't know that difference . 
  nice , in portuguese we use - inha / - inho instead . 
  nh = italian gn, 
  what i wanted is that when a text is presented , you can tell what language it is by knowing some suffix . 
  in brazilian portuguese when a word/syllabe ends with l it has also the sound of w. 
  ` ov ' - he listens to black metal . 
  portuguese one is wrong , its outono . 
  moreover , it is grammatically wrong in portuguese to end a word with a 'n' . 
  mirandese is also just spoken in a tiny area . 
  yeah . 
  ` estados unidos da am\u00e9rica ', 
  in portuguese is eua, 
  they 've been spending most their lives living in a merkel 's paradise . 
  is there any suffix that can distinguish your european language from all the other european languages ? 
  for example if you see a word ending in - \u00e7\u00e3o , its portuguese . 
  now you can distinguish it from spanish .
