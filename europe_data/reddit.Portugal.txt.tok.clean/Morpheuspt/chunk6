  its the old leftist connundrum . 
  the ( far ) left does n't care if the poor are less poor , as long as the rich are less rich . 
  [ it 's kinda cute how you seem to believe no money at all reaches athens . 
  its like the 7 fucking billion dollars that greece wants just come out of thin air .

  what ??? 
  are you saying that journalistic pieces do n't correspond to 100 % of all cases studied ? 
  shocking . 
  either way , polls show greeks would welcome more austerity , if they can stay in the euro . 
  so whichever party wins elections , they are not going against their people by accepting more austerity , if it means staying in the eurozone . 
   the idea of counter-cyclic spending itself makes sense . 
  in ideal conditions it 's a very clearly cut-out issue . 
  i agree with everything you said except for this . 
  but to back myself up , i have proof , we did just that between 2008 and 2011 , and our debt increased in the dozens , and our deficit went into 11.2 % in 2010 . 
  so , polls say that greeks overwhelmingly support staying in the euro , even if it means more austerity . 
  but they also voted in a party that promised no more austerity , and if elections happen anytime soon , they 'll get even more votes . 
  does n't this seem like a contradiction to you ? 
  i mention this , because although siryza promised no more austerity , they 'll eventually have to do it , but it wo n't be a breach of democracy , because most of the greeks support it , if it means staying in the euro . 
  that happened in portugal for decades . 
  when we were recieving funds from europe , instead of using it on things that would last us for decades , that would prepare and make us ready to face a crisis in the future , we decided to spend it on frivolous things , things we did n't need . 
  be it stadiums , the expo 1998 , ridiculous highways and bridges , etc. 
  we totally forgot ports , railways , factory production , agriculture , fishing , etc. 
  today 's portuguese economy is based on the tertiary sector , 70-80 % of it . 
  we forgot our industry and agriculture , and lost some to globalization . 
  but we basically forgot how to make things . 
   and no amount of reassurance by the ecb and europe 's leaders would suffice to bring them down from stratospheric levels they ca n't really say that the interest rates are going down only because of the ecb , and then the next day say that ecb has no control over interest rates . 
  but i 'm not surprised . 
  stiglitz is a keynesian , he needs public investment . 
  problem is , countries that are shit broke ca n't invest shit . 
  everyone loves growth and investment . 
  this is n't america , europe will always left a left-of-centre sort of ideology that will always give you a welfare state , some more than others . 
  its just a question of having the money to pay for it . 
  hey , you tell that to the germans , about bailing out southern countries , and you 'll see what `` they were n't elected on the premise of enforcing specific economic policies on countries who failed the eu . '', 
  means . 
  we 're not expanding debt , the current budget , if everything goes to plan , should reduce debt this year . 
  it might be that i 'm tired ( which i am ) , but i did n't understand your sentence . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  its weird how you 're so certain that it wo n't last , and at the same time so certain that greece will become the next european powerhouse just by leaving the euro . 
   since 2009 , portuguese government debt as a proportion of its gdp has gone from 70 % to 130 % . 
  when the eu tells you to invest in the economy , particularly infrastructure and other construction , and paying that investment with debt to fight a crisis that 's booming all over the world , and then your economy contracts , and you take on a 76mm euro loan , that tends to happen . 
  still , lower than greece , and did n't take us the biggest debt haircut in history to achieve . 
   `` what the fuck an i doing kissing german derriere ? '', 
  getting loans from the markets with negative interest . 
  something that tsipras masturbates to every night . 
  let me know when greece can afford that . 
  the things you mention , its like a venezuela without oil . 
  good luck with that , honestly . 
  i ` ld honestly want to see such an experiment . 
  if you 're going british , yes . 
  thousands of millions . 
  precisely my point . 
  i 'm not saying you are assuming more regulations mean more employement , i am however saying some people here on / r/europe think strongly that way . 
  and using your example , connecting the dots either way is a stretch . 
   drachma wouldnt work , we have a major trade deficit so it would be pointless for us . 
  well its not that black and white . 
  with a devalued drachma , imports drop to the high price , and greeks are stimulated to buy locally instead . 
  and a low drachma would also help stimulate exports amd tourism . 
  sure , inflation would be a problem in the short term , but between that situation and staying in the euro in such a weak economy , i think it 's a discussion worth having . 
  [ plus as you can see , ] ( http://www.dw.de/image/0,,18282498_401,00.png ) its pretty irrelevant if greece stays or goes for the rest of the eurozone . 
  if its best for greece , that 's another story . 
  i think they 're saying the same . 
   and that europe gave greece a `` last offer '' europe being greece 's creditors . 
  they reached a consensus amongst themselves , not with greece . 
   assume it would be reasonably easy to do so . 
  it is now . 
  unless you 're in the public sector . 
   they are not unemployed / thread . 
  portuguese newspapers are calling it `` two plans for greece in a collision course '' . 
  they 're also saying greece wo n't cave into more demands , and that europe gave greece a `` last offer '' . 
  if i i had to bet , i ` ld put my money on a default . 
  i think this whole ordeal is becoming way to exploited , like doing dozens of strikes in quick succession . 
  it just comes a time people do n't care anymore . 
  and europe 's starting to care less and less about the greek situation . 
  but they did get the biggest debt haircut in history . 
  we should n't moralize , of course . 
  but it was the greeks themselves that got into this mess , with the way they spent money over past decades . 
  portugal has the same problem , and is in the same situation , except with less debt , a growing economy , and less unemployement . 
  the thing is , i neither want greece to default , nor want to give my money to greece for free . 
  my solution is another haircut , with a controlled return to the drachma . 
  well we have been growing when the euro is high , and we 're going at it when the euro is low . 
  oil prices same deal . 
  it does affect us , namely the oil pricing , since a key factor in our exports is refined oil . 
  but then again , we do import the oil to make those refined products , so cheap sells for cheap . 
  my point is , euro and oil fluctuations have n't impacted significantly portugal 's economy . 
  i guess spain could be the same , to some extent . 
   1.4 million `` aufstocker '' are ppl who work like 4h/week are not in the statistic . 
  what ??? 
  working people are n't considered unemployed ? 
  the horror . 
  what 's next ? 
  people who have a broken nail are n't considered terminally ill ? 
  this world is really going to shit . 
   you 'd think that protected workers with protected wages would be pretty much the only ones reliably propping up internal demand ; that 's already a problem with your argument right there . 
  a corporation hires 500 workers with protected contracts to make 1000 tones of socks each month . 
  but the market they sell to , can only handle 500 socks a month . 
  the factory ca n't sell , does n't make enough money , and goes bust . 
  what would you do in this siatuation ? 
  fire half the workers and stay in production , or take all 500 and go bankrupt ? 
  you can just say `` its the corporation 's fault , because they overachieved in the number of workers they employ '' . 
  well but the harm 's done , and looking at the past wo n't solve things for this particular case .
