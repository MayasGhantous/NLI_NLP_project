  salazar may sway more to his side for his deep attachment and support of `` the old values '' , and the fact that to his credit , he was n't corrupt or evil , just a deeply misguided man who i believe genuinely worked for what he believed was our best interests . 
  but he was wrong , dead wrong , and it 's a shame sectors of our society still whitewash his crimes . 
  but his supporters are still a lot less than you claim . 
  what a shame it 's just spin . 
  as sad as it is , our world simply is n't prepared to go and remove a tyrant such as saddam without a bullshit excuse and even more bullshit * actual * reason . 
  i remember being joyful at the toppling of his statue . 
  why could n't that have been the sole purpose of it all , my young self asked ... 
  i honestly wondered if someone would ask this , with how salazar remains - god knows why - favorably seen outside . 
  a man whose ideal for the country [ was this ] ( https://noseahistoria.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/deus-pc3a1tria-famc3adlia.jpg ) and who ( regardless of the many who claim `` he was n't so bad ) used most tricks in the dictatorship bag to try to implement it could not possibly be a figure that elevated portugal in the world - and he was n't . 
  under his dominion , we became increasingly isolated ( `` proudly alone '' , as the regime proclaimed while pumping out ludicrous propaganda [ like this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7dzmprwmm6m/vno3ka_ocli/aaaaaaaau8o/zwb-uqsggy4/s1600/figura%2b1%2b-%2bportugal%2bna%cc%83o%2be%cc%81%2bum%2bpai%cc%81s%2bpequeno.jpg ) ) by his own initiative , with nato as our only link to the outside world . 
  i make no attempt to hide my bias against him , but he was very far from the greatest `` leader '' portugal ever had . 
  a small minded individual who only made our country even more irrelevant . 
  maria i is an unlikely choice at best for portugal . 
  the portuguese empire was in decline by then , and despite her accomplishments , particularly in welfare and poor relief , she simply is n't our most relevant or powerful monarch - and the cynical side of me ca n't help but wonder if she was chosen for her gender . 
  her accent is accurate , if quite unsuitable for a royal imo , and * reaaaally * pushes the * v\u00f3s * conjugation in her speech - our version of fake ye olde english . 
  edit : okay she 's actually voiced by a guy . 
  that explains a lot ... 
  i would have gone with jo\u00e3o ii or v - the leaders during the groundbreaking expansion and the pinnacle of the empire , respectively . 
  the past elections in the uk and spain have honestly come as a bit of a shock to me , as someone who 's used to very accurate polling here in portugal . 
  are we just good at it , are our voters just more honest , or is it simply a matter of population and sample sizes ? 
  good call . 
  tumbleweed is too expensive right now . 
  shower thought : when was the last time europe was held in such high regard by ... anyone , really ? 
  to the point where germany ( rightfully or not ) was literally being called paradise ( * jannah * ) by refugees ? 
  for all our problems , we 're being viewed as heaven on earth . 
  i do n't think i can possibly think of higher praise than that . 
  it would be quite nice if we could live up to that reputation . 
  a wall would be a good idea ; would be a good anchor for when we finally get tired of britain 's bullshit and decide to remove their island privileges by land-filling the channel . 
  well , the house is on fire . 
  of course it is . 
  the democratic process does n't make its conclusions infallible nor uniquestionale . 
  [ mandatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mull_of_kintyre_test ) . 
  but there is nothing they can do against an independence vote . 
  if they block eu entrance of an * already * independent scotland , they will receive nothing but scorn for treating a sovereign nation as a breakaway region throwing a tantrum . 
  my profound apologies for the necropost , but i 'm on an old thread binge and by god this is fitting right now . 
  you got ta wonder exactly * where * he gets these flags from ... 
  an explanation for unfair circumstances beyond our control . 
  not a handwave justification to legitimize any unfair circumstances that we * can * act upon . 
  which goes to show just how terrifying this situation is when * i literally can not imagine something that bad * that thatcher would be preferable . 
  you 'd go from a shit version of got to a real one , then . 
  i 'd give 4 weeks before the iron throne got moved to downing street . 
  it 's still a stretch to say the world , and european occupied countries in particular , could perceive the fall of germany right there and then . 
  it 's obvious today , but hindsight , etc. 
  the turnout was phenomenal , i do n't see any legitimacy issues arising from there . 
  the lack of a qualified majority for a decision of this magnitude , however , is quite worrying . 
  all of europe has been watching this debate and seeing itself be treated as * trash * , continental refuse . 
  even the remain camp was full of pragmatists who saw remaining in a union of inferiors as a lesser evil , or those like gordon brown , who said the uk ought to `` lead , not to leave '' the eu - none of them even remotely accepting seeing the uk as * a nation among nations as it should be * . 
  something more . 
  something higher . 
  something * above * . 
  not that this contempt to `` continentals '' is new - it goes beyond recorded history . 
  but one would imagine that in the modern day , it 'd be nothing more than a stereotype . 
  americans are fat , south europeans are lazy , germans are meticulous , and the british stand above the continent . 
  all false generalizations , all borne of culture , but all of them remain around only as a humorous poke on one another . 
  or at least , that 's what they should be . 
  the campaign and the vote have proven this not to be the case . 
  the hostility you 're seeing towards britain - or england , rather - is only appropriate considering the bullshit from you the rest of europe has had to endure throughout this debate . 
  do please judge quality rather than outright effort as well . 
  the correlation is n't that clear cut . 
  an independent roi has existed since far before our generation , who sees it as something established , rather than a historical achievement - even if they 're aware its history . 
  the prospect of a united ireland has simply been so far for most alive that i simply ca n't imagine those polls being accurate representations of a scenario where it was in fact on the table . 
  as for the economic drawbacks , i emphasize the relatively part . 
  scotland 's potential independent economic situation has n't changed much , possibly somewhat worse ; what * has * changed is its economic prospects within the uk , if we are to give credit to the expected economic downturn from brexit . 
  suppose we 'll have to see if that comes to pass . 
  i would n't give much credit to those support polls - it 's been nothing but a pipe dream for decades now , and anyone in those polls would be acutely aware of it . 
  with a reasonable prospect now on the table , i 'm sure there 'll be a rethinking going around - if it hits a majority , however , that 's to be seen . 
  the case of scotland is more clear cut to me . 
  a decision made for a generation can only stand if the conditions for it also stand for the generation . 
  the fact they 'd have to leave the eu on independence , and the assurances they 'd stay in by the union campaign , played a big part in convincing the scottish electorate . 
  not two years later and that 's out the window , despite a clear show form scotland of what they want for their future in europe . 
  together with the economic drawbacks being far less severe now ( in relative terms ) due to brexit , scotland has just lost the two primary political and economical reasons they voted for remaining in the uk . 
  the road is open . 
  ps : i 'd try and show a bit more finesse in shooting down the rising prospects in this thread . 
  brexit just blew every legislative blast door open ; the only course of action is debate if they are crossed , not trying to imagine they 're still there . 
  it 'll be a hilarious twist of fate if that 'd be how unification came about . 
  though of course , that 'll only come after the unionists fight a schizophrenic war against themselves . 
  they voted remain , will have to secede for that to come to pass like scotland , but ... they 're unionists . 
  british trump . 
  even shares his hairdresser . 
  i was joking about this yesterday , but this was predictable . 
  the uk has just cleared the way for spain to economically besiege gibraltar . 
  and the english fuck everything up again . 
  history repeats itself . 
  and today , europe survived another murder attempt . 
  thankfully . 
   as he continued , fillon scowled and muttered words to the effect of : `` i 'll fucking sue you . '' wait , what ? 
  carmo itself is ( surprisingly ! ),

  i used one ( lisbon , # 28 ) for my daily commute for a few years . 
  and well , it worked , but there were always delays caused by people acting like it was exclusively a tourist trip - we have extra fancy trams in estrela for that . 
  the tram lines running through old core lisbon and porto are very hilly , and not at all suitable for long , modern trams . 
  and given their highly scenic routes , restoring and maintaining old trams was the most logical solution . 
  i hope they wo n't repeat it next year . 
  it 'll just turn into a battle between people trying to replicate the same things and groups bitter their stuff was left out or too small . 
  maybe in a few . 
  took me a while to figure out as well , but it 's a fan/dicussion sub for [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worm_ ( web_serial ) - hence the appeal to `` read worm '' . 
  i thoroughly agree with you , actually . 
  i remember reading an interview by a s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 e principe minister who said the biggest post-independence tragedy of his nation , poor yet one of the stablest and most democratic in africa , was how their strong investment in education was being for naught , with their best and brightest seeking a better future elsewhere - in many cases , right here .
