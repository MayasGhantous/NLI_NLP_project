  freshly-made sangria is sex . 
  bottled or boxed sangria is necrophilia . 
  with le pen farther and farther away from victory , i think i 'm safe in reassuming my position that sch\u00e4uble is the most dangerous man in europe . 
  as as i like schultz by himself , the prospect of driving schl\u00e4ube as far away as possible from a position of power and influence is for me the most important issue in european politics for 2017 . 
  false equivalency . 
  assuming there even was such a bus , it does not justify another group to parade vulgar messages in opposition . 
  what do you mean , * less * controversial ? 
  yes , no , and no . 
   comment making use of the word cuck with political connotation , disregarding what that says about my confidence as a male whenever foreigners are within a 5km radius of local women, 
  name checks out . 
  which is why most people [ do it indoors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbaclpkon6q ) , i presume . 
  the rims !, 
  a few years ago the world cycling champs were in firenze . 
  i spent the entire race telling myself do n'tclimbtheduomodon ` tclimbtheduomodo n'tclimbtheduomodon ` tclimbtheduomodo n'tclimbtheduomodon ` tclimbtheduomodo n'tclimbtheduomodon ` tclimbtheduomo, 
  let 's look at the stuff headlining in my country right now . 
  - whether or not the finance minister texted implicitly or explicitly to the state-owned bank 's then new ceo - who resigned months ago - that he did n't have to make his income statements public . 
  and this discussion has been going on for months and overriding everything , even the great economic results that were just published . 
  yeah , i think trump 's antics are more relevant for me . 
  part of me wants there to be a [ lady of the rock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lady_of_ro ) , raising the eu flag there after brexit ... makes me wonder how much of protest symbol the eu flag will become in the uk . 
  i 'm not sure what i 'd hate most : pnr rising or cmtv being considered a legitimate news channel . 
  and here i thought it 'd be saint seiya . 
  where are the three pashas ? 
  i honestly ca n't remember the cartoon well , but i assume that 's for a very good reason . 
  i can assure you the comics are brilliant . 
  granted , part of its appeal for me was the fact i was already a motorsports fan , from before i could probably read , and the sheer realism of the comics took me aback . 
  real drivers , real tracks , incredibly detailed drawings , an absolute dream for someone like me . 
  but the stories itself were also pretty good , and there are many who got into motorsports through michel vaillant , famously alain prost . 
  [ there was ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=momalaguumo ) , and i do remember it airing here as well ( but not any specifics ) , but i ca n't vouch for its quality , specially with a title hot wheels sponsorship . 
  it 's a video displaying violent protests in paris and attempt to extrapolate them for immigration propaganda , ignoring ( willingly , probably ) the fact these protests have historically stemmed from police abuse . 
  a microcosm of similar protests in the us , in a way . 
  it is hosted by a channel labelled `` politically incorrect australia '' ... which once again turns out to mean '' * factually * incorrect '' . 
  it took me getting up the comment chain to realize they were not being sarcastic . 
  i think . 
  huh , hamon is polling double what i expected . 
  pfffft , considering individuals as such in politics ? 
  arise eurocanards the gripen has a special place in my heart . 
  i gave my aussie mate a call and he gave special dispensation to use the word in this justifiable instance . 
  * grabs baking paddle *, 
  that explains that retaliation mission i got in brussels . 
  i 'll grab my sword . 
  there 's more albanian-majority areas left in serbia than serbian-majority areas in kosovo , so such an exchange would never be acceptable to serbia . 
  plus , i believe the territories would become discontinuous , with all the issues that 'd raise . 
  get out out of the stage . 
  there was mosaddegh , but ... well , yeah . 
  ... the hell are you even talking about . 
  [ this always comes in handy ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ) . 
  [ they 've already set the table !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3itoe3lidw ), 
  and there was a recent proposal to add another lane to it ... by narrowing the existing ones . 
  again . 
  * why * oh why do i read the youtube comments . 
  well , at least i found a pretty accurate one : `` 89 % `` we need reconquista in europe now ! '', 
  6 % triggered muslims 5 % `` i am spanish/portuguese and i 'm proud !! 1 !! 11 !!! 1 !, 
  rumors of sordid love affairs by a french politician . 
  is n't that par for the course ? 
  this is outright slander . 
  hope he sues . 
  you 're telling me this is a rat burger ? 
  lmao , instead of adding morocco , they just replaced vatican city with it . 
  the saracens are coming, 
  slice the damn pineapples [ ... but i 'll defend them to my death if they do . 
  i ca n't imagine it can be expected for other countries to take our interests in mind , then . 
  europeans , probably - to the extent having a black hole between sub - saharan africa and europe is acceptable . 
  just look away , it 's all good . 
  for libyans , no . 
  at least when you die to a bomb your family knows . 
  not so much when you get disappeared by the whims of a lunatic . 
  the gaddafi apologism these days baffles the mind . 
  there are no `` our '' sons of bitches . 
  there 's only sons of bitches . 
  we need to be really careful in going forward in that front , no doubt - qualified majorities have to remain a must - , but [ history shows us strict unanimity ca n't endure forever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ) . 
  it was not a case of preemptive censorship . 
  english subs here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3igeo9fyaa, 
  i somehow still want to ... 
  it 's also a pun - `` poilus '' , the generic term for a french soldier in ww1 ( like tommy or digger ) , means `` hairy '' . 
  well , both america and australia have the luxury of land . 
  us , not so much . 
  it 's a matter of geography rather than culture . 
  i figured it 'd be the finnish cow who 'd be on winter camo , waiting for the bears . 
  guess i was wrong . 
  valls seems to have retracted from it since . 
  which as much as i support macron , is probably good , because if hamon gathers a left-wing coalition and valls threw his lot with macron , that might have been it for ps . 
  as the article states , any petition that reaches 100000 signatures must be considered for debate in parliament . 
  should that happen , it 'll already be consequential enough to make it relevant . 
  i 'm indy neidell , welcome to the great - wait . 
  that 'd be great . 
  just hope they have enough any funds left for it from their previous refugee aid . 
  itt fantasy road cycling scenarios ( as far as roads would allow ) . 
  i 'm proud for eesti :'), 
  there are intolerant muslims . 
  and there are intolerant muslims in europe . 
  news at 11 . 
  any concept of collective intolerance ceases to make sense when we have muslims of different branches and schools , of different cultures , nationalities , ethnicities and socioeconomic status are spread across different countries . 
  while any of those may be an influence , it is ultimately an individual matter , not a collective one . 
  the notion that muslims come `` dialed in '' with a preset level of intolerance is moot when those displays of intolerance come from individuals who differ in all of the above , but hail from communities who are otherwise mostly peaceful . 
  the issue of intolerant muslims * is * widely acknowledged - which is why it 's being tackled . 
  it 's why there 's integration classes , it 's why we have legal and legislative discussions and decisions about it . 
  and personally , anyone who 's willingly intolerant ( and not simply ignorant ) has in fact no palce in our society . 
  but do n't blame one for the sins of the father . 
  poisoned wells are a dangerous myth .
