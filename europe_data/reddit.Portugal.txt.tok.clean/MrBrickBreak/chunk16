  and the much higher yields become a large cause of a potential default in themselves by the additional pressure they place on the economy . 
  the investors are at risk of losing their investments due to the very rates they charge on them . 
  sovereign yields are , for the most part , not a function of `` hard '' economics , but of trust on the issuer and of perception of profitability by the investor . 
  and the first part is failing * hard * , for speculative reasons . 
  greece has underwent years of almost complete fiscal control by the eu , has had money on tap from the eurozone and the ecb to pay back investors , and as a last resort , has been subject to debt value and yield restructures that should have made it quite capable of sustaining its debt - were the yields at sane , european levels . 
  considering all its eu backing , greek debt is ( or was ) mathematically and politically trustworthy . 
  there 's simply been an abject failure to establish fact as truth in the markets . 
  and every side is to blame for it - though i certainly see more fault with speculative investors ( read : a small minority ) and particularly credit rating agencies , whose business model is a complete scam - but that 's a discussion for another day . 
  uh , never made the association ( and well , never seen maga abbreviated as such ) . 
  love it though . 
  thank you . 
  out of the loop here . 
  what 's with mega ? 
  seen it associated with schulz . 
  that is generally acknowledged . 
  the possibility of them ever becoming a majority , * and * that would happen within a short enough timeframe that those values remain unchanged until such an occasion , is negligible to impossible . 
  do not relativize . 
  your comment is not solely being criticized by association , but for it 's content . 
  suuure we do . 
  the unlikeliness of such a scenario is something that takes a lot ideological dedication to ignore . 
  that 's pretty neat , but i 've got a small channel and i like to interact with my viewers . 
  got ta take the bad with the good of youtube , i guess . 
  i honestly do n't know why i still bother scrolling down . 
  it 's pure morbid curiosity . 
  i think you 'd probably get a rash if you walked through ours . 
  still like it though . 
  it 's kind of sobering to see just how much history has piled up over the centuries on the shield . 
  as a lisbon native , it 's doubly silly .

  i 'm the opposite here . 
  i found myself enjoying lwt far more than the daily show right off the bad , in part due to his style of comedy , but also because of the uncommon topics he covers . 
  of course , that last part waned last year , with so much time dedicated to the elections , and the show suffered . 
  and frankly , i 'm afraid trump will give him so much material he 'll be stuck on him ... 
  first a link to europe , then to new new york . 
  i love this rivalry . 
  the page says little about his governance other than his intentions , though . 
  the one concrete thing i could gather from it was that he was thrown under the bus by karamarko . 
  we 've been down this road before . 
  [ nuclear deterrence does not work against low-scale conventional actions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massive_retaliation ) . 
  yes , because the last 65 years of european history have been a disaster . 
  we also have the disadvantage of not have a unified movement yet - various municipalities have demonstrated interest and i doubt there 's been any talks between them yet . 
  it 's actually probably the same in the netherlands , but it seems the top dutch ( lol ) have more cohesion than us as a whole . 
  i do n't think it 's lost yet - our resources are an advantage that ca n't be ignored , and shipping cars out will be as much an issue as shipping lithium in the netherlands . 
  but we need to put on a hell of a show . 
  enough taking it slow and waiting for groups - pick a spot on the map , get the government in gear right away , and show them we want to become tesla : the country . 
  [ i ca n't claim credit ] ( https://shop.spreadshirt.net/thegreatwar/rumble+on+the+isonzo+poster+60x90-a109631844 ) , but goddamn if it 's not hilarious .

  okay , now that 's dumb . 
  that 's what embassies are for .

  if only they 'd spent all the ammunition on that semi-final ... 
  is your handle related ? 
  though sadly , part of me wonders what the reaction would be were she standing next to the hungarian wall . 
  same statement , different historical perspective . 
  a shower thought ( or question , rather ) : what do the polish people think of kurdish nationalism , and the autonomy/independence claims by the various factions fighting for it ? 
  as an ethnic nation that 's been divided amongst regional powers for centuries ( well , millennia , but it 's nationalism movement is far more recent ) , i ca n't help but see a parallel . 
  i assume it 's as much of a discussed issue as elsewhere in the west - that is to say , not at all - , but i am curious nonetheless . 
  even less necessary , then . 
  rake in the cold , get none of the snow . 
  an interesting proposal , but i prefer [ the french approach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qefko3fsdzw ) . 
  there was a similar case in germany a few weeks ago . 
  is swimming a universal part of the curriculum in central europe ? 
  i was fortunate it was in my ( public ) school , but it 's by no means universal . 
  you 're correct in the definition , but the fact is we are not terrorized . 
  this terrorism wave is even more of a failure by that standard than on simple body count . 
  hitler 's got ta get to that oil somehow . 
  and get jeremy clarkson to direct it . 
  you know , a friend of mine defends that if mussolini was alive today , with his machismo and flamboyance , he 'd probably be a wrestling heel .

  but they 're most often ridiculous and over the top enough that it 's obvious it 's a prank . 
  on topic , [ here 's his idea of a robbery prank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5ell-zrbu ) . 
  eventually , yes . 
  last month there was report only a very small percentage of refugees in germany are employed , and some ( but not most ) took it with some shock . 
  which it really should n't be , with that short of a timeframe for language learning , job searching and cultural integration , specially considered not all are allowed to do the first two . 
  eh ... hey , i 'm as fond of a good reconquista as the next guy , but come on now . 
  what i would n't give for a 553 ... or anything sig ever produced , really . 
  that is an unexpected amount of embassies , now that you mention it .
