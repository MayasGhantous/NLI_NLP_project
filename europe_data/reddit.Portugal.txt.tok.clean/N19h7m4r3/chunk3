  the new electrics are interesting but the doors are extraordinary . 
  the lock , handle , hinge , balance ... 
  pretty much perfect all around . 
  you 'll never look at car doors the same way . 
  if article 50 is triggered and things are n't going their way can they just go `` jaja jk we did n't really mean to leave '' ? 
  might piss of a lot of people but might avoid bigger troubles ? 
  we do n't know who was pissing on who yet . 
  there could have been an alpaca present for all we know . 
  no one elected her so you also have that going for you . 
  unfortunately yes , we 're still in 2016 . 
  was n't porsche the owners of vw thanks to that failed takeover ? 
  plus ireland wants to stick around . 
  everyone 's missing a few billions in taxes . 
  and portugal , kinda , apparently . 
  i 've read 1 or 2 studies that mention that one of the best predictors of child having a erm not shitty life is how old the mother is when she has her first child . 
  possible causes were financial safety bla bla ... 
  the other month i saw over 45\u00ba so ... 
  the sun today was absurdly hot . 
  it was like half the atmosphere just vanished and we were getting peak radiation . 
  that 's versus the usdollar . 
  that 's just seeing who 's second to last . 
  [ here 's the graph against the euro ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=1y ) it 's close to an 8 month low and if it goes under that you 'll have to go back to 2010-2011 . 
  but you know , keep up the good work . 
  i can confirm there are n't enough redheads in portugal . 
  pretty sure we still do n't trust anyone . 
  food 's probably better though . 
  both can be right . 
  eucalyptus can be considered an environmental calamity too considering the damage it does to the soil . 
  hum , less fighting and more standing around . 
  i guess i can get behind that . 
  i should have probably skim less and read the article more . 
  except the bull ? 
  all the suffering comes before the killing . 
  there 's a lot more country to see ? 
  plus there are enough tourists in sintra as it is . 
  can i just say quinta da regaleira is nice and all , but it 's in lisbon . 
  other cool places too . 
  ger\u00eas is like a giant forresty region like the smalish regaleira gardens . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  really ? 
  [ model suggests fear of crime is contagious . 
  ] ( https://phys.org/news/2017-07-crime-contagious.html ), 
  people take shit too seriously on the internet and i 've always felt that explicitly mentioning it 's sarcasm defeats the purpose . 
  ehem . 
  we stopped being spain quite some time ago . 
  [ use this for future references ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_peninsula ), 
  yeah the sun can be killer here . 
  even when it 's spring when the air is cold , if you 're in a car or near glass in a building and have skin exposed it gets hot real quick . 
  yeah i had a couple of those days to . 
  extreme heat in portugal can be a curse and a blessing because it 's usually dry heat , so it 'll dry you like a prune real quick but as long as you keep hydrated you 'll live since you can still sweat . 
  it 's not like tropical/jungle with high humidity that you just want to die . 
  meh , i 've been in  45\u00bac a few times around castelo branco and alentejo . 
  though i have to say i would n't have expected that much in switzerland . 
  fun fact : wc stands for water closet . 
  playing the uk version of cards against humanity now a days is much easier . 
  it 's a lot quicker to explain what a tory is now . 
  how hot was it ? 
  reports of racist violence are n't rare . 
  what 's pretty unheard of is charges being brought against anyone . 
  also i 'm guessing not all 18 officers are guilty of the more serious charges , charges probably revolve around not intervening . 
  but considering how cautious the guy from the police syndicate was i 'm pretty sure the prosecution has a pretty strong case and someone 's guilty . 
  would have been a fun chat to have if he had insurance . 
  `` so what happened ? '', 
  oh god why am i agreeing with juncker ?!, 
  this should n't happen !, 
  only thing chile is clearly better at than portugal is penalties . 
  we 'll know how good it is in a few months . 
  sucks . 
  holy shit , that hail is huge . 
  must have hurt like crazy . 
  hope it did n't ruin too many crops . 
  eu might push for a sale that usually means a heavy loss for the state . 
  check portugal . 
  probably because reading `` demand a euro 99.6 billion brexit divorce bill '' is absurd . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jd-al6hl8a this should answer a few of your questions . 
  tl ; dr : `` top '' universities and colleges `` guarantee '' you 're income will be closer to the top compared to others . 
  but for most people , especially from low-income backgrounds , any degree is worth it . 
  even if some are better than others . 
  the smart thing to do here is go long on popcorn stock . 
  they wo n't need to work too hard , there are a bunch of loop holes . 
  a nostalgia thread about our grand alliance and how shit was done at the time . 
  but like , a bit over the top lol just how i like my reddit . 
  it just came to my attention that that would be a pretty funny sub-reddit but i do n't have the time and patience to put the work in ... 
  you 're the one to talk :|, 
  reddit 's been helping out : https://np.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/6elu69/help_europol_fight_child_abuse_by_identifying/, 
  the numbers come back to life as zombies ? 
  fun fact : with global warming temperatures in europe should go down as cold water from the pole cap melts and disrupts hot water currents from the caribbean . 
  at least for as long as there 's ice up/down there . 
  edit : / down . 
  the correct term is xenophobic , i believe . 
  in my defense i do n't think the uk would appreciate me voting on this election . 
  i 'm actually quite shocked by how accurate it seems to be . 
  can i just say , that i really do n't understand why women are the ones that wear skirts ... 
  i 've only been in drag 2/3 times but they are so comfortable since they do n't apply pressure ... plus it 's like having permanent air-conditioning for your balls . 
  kudos to the scots that know how it 's done . 
  i think the take away is that we 'll eat anything that moves , even if it was just the wind . 
  it 's still free . 
  investing 10m $ and not having to spend 5m $ buying the estate is a nice freebee . 
  is it for everyone ? 
  no , but it probably will help with their objectives .
