agree 100 % . 
  but you would n't want to drop the towel . 
  do n't know that oil , but depends on what are you doing with the oil ... a salad of paprika and onions , wit that olive oil and wine vinegar and a pinch of salt ... that 's good tasty food ... do n't know finnish tastes ... but certainly different from mediterranean tastes ... 
  this . 
  other reasons is that you can see that 's olive oil , and not sunflower oil ( inappropriate for seasoning ) . 
  also , we normally season with salt , oil and vinegar ... everybody has their taste ... 
  and some `` portuguese '' oils , are made with spanish olives ... : s, 
  omg , could n't imagine that the olive oil consumption was so disparate between portugal , and ( e.g. ), 
  spain ... how do you eat so much olive oil ? 
  we use olive foi for everything , yet we use less than 1/10 of spain . 
  do you use olive oil to fry ? 
  because it 's only where we use sunflower oil . 
  because you never experience an olive oil made in portugal !, 
  maybe greece and \u00d6streich can form the ex-eu association ... 
  it would be like the eu , but just better ... see you there ... 
  that `` e '' looks like a lowercase epsilon . 
  assaulted or not , the man is unarmed . 
  why use a fucking steel baton ? 
  stolen stuff from other continents . 
  i mean ... http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/86/121386-004-04d0e536.jpg stole the religion from the middle-east , the obelisk is stolen from egypt ... and many much more examples ... 
  what ? 
  we are better than the greeks , sorry greek people , and i 'm not saying this because i 'm portuguese . 
  at least , the majority of people does n't believe there 's an easy way out . 
  while the greeks do believe that . 
  keeping that in mind is key to political stability and solving the problem . 
  how can a country that 's filled with brilliant smart people have that troglodyte at the front ? 
  who let him in ? 
  and how do you know that ? 
  those are two highly classified planes , that never engaged in mass , and are in continuous development . 
  fanboi of what ? 
  f22 is the best there is . 
  good !, 
  it 's a very well accepted movie . 
  i prefer `` sunkissed '' for `` morena '' . 
  yeah , wikipedia is not the be all end all of knowledge . 
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1103287 http://www.publico.pt/culturaipsilon/jornal/portugal-ficou-de-luto-pelo-ditador-alemao-16711 of course salazar was n't dumb , and siding with germany would be very dumb , but his political ideologies were much closer to those of the axies then those of the allies . 
  looks like paulo portas . 
   the uk defended portugal against napoleon ( eventually ) and convinced them to officially remain neutral during wwii . 
  we remained neutral to avoid fucking war and to profit from both sides , selling tungsten/wolfram , nothing to do with uk . 
  weak ? 
  seriously ? 
  typical japanese http://www.animeclick.it/prove/upload/img/news9976.jpg vs typical portuguese https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/2010/08/31/0/192/1922398/103286172_10/i/pictures-shirtless-cristiano-ronaldo-david-beckham-la.jpg, 
  and we did n't need a single bullet to kill the japanese . 
  they kill themselves . 
  just translate a little bit of fado , and it 's everything we need . 
  you 've guessed it . 
  tripeiro here . 
   but i do n't think my house gets that cold ( 10 \u00b0 c ) during winter . 
  but my flat is very good at conserving energy , older houses it 's a different story , and for the interior is also different . 
  listen to this : good quality audio , no video : https://youtu.be/livowfykt9w?t=1m6s 240p video , bad quality audio : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4q8r7rbbr8, 
  it would n't be anything new ... 
  why not ? 
  if they can put satellites , they can put satellites with rocket in the back . 
  not only that , but we can enjoy a better living , since we can do more things while travelling . 
  like eating breakfast , or taking a shower in the morning . 
  damn , german rap sounds strange . 
  hey romania , you now have 12 more certified preowned f16 's with mlu !, 
  send a motherfucking missile salvo from space . 
  there 's no magic shield that 's going to save russian oil refineries from that . 
  without diesel , the tanks are useless . 
  there are no nuclear powered tanks . 
  i have those things , are just valves to open/close the heating to that particular radiator . 
  i know what they are , i do n't know how to use them , everytime i try , something fucks up , and i do n't know why . 
  signed : a stupid person from a country where you do n't really need this . 
  jeans as we know today started gaining popularity in the us in the late 19th century . 
  it took until the 1950 's to gain worldwide mass appeal . 
  and took until the 80s/90s to be admitted in the high price designer clothing section . 
  until then , even the farmers used heavy cheap fabric , were generally black and not blue , were much looser and generally had pleats ( must be very low class to have trousers without pleats ) . 
  yep . 
  they could n't predict the jeans and the changes they made . 
  could n't be portugal , the house is red , do n't know any house that 's red here , the old lady looks gipsy to me . 
  nordic countries are so classy by not doing anything and staying at home . 
  it was kidding too . 
  calm down , mexico , they can retort with adele . 
  if some people could n't understand brexit , they just need to look at this post . 
  what 's the matter ? 
  alentejanos also do it ... or you can call it `` power nap '' to be modern . 
  hmm ... taiwan does n't exist , because it 's formosa island . 
  portugal is obviously not spain , we do n't watch `` peliculas dobladas '' . 
  i agree with you . 
  americans actually get this right . 
  quarter mile times and ending speeds , plz . 
  but we also need electric cars we can dream of having . 
  that 's one reason the tesla are working on people . 
  cmd + f `` witcher '' ... you beat me to it !, 
  hiberno-english ? 
  so do i !, 
  thank you , spain . 
  we would n't mind if you sent nothing , as you are also needing the resources . 
  from what i read , spain individually offered more help to portugal than the eu ( 1 plane ) ... 
  or the supermarket is already established , and the coffeeshop is expanding . 
   that 's not how it works . 
  that 's how it works . 
  the consumer end prices , do n't have jack shit to production costs . 
  also , there are things more important than production costs , like pollution , independence from external energy sources , how much portugal is investing right now in energy production , how much money el\u00e9ctrica de portugal is profiting , etc. 
   those very high taxes you are paying go towards doing this . 
  sorry , i can not continue `` discussing '' with people with your intelligence . 
   had all your energy been nuclear for example , you would not need those backups , so your energy tax and vat would be extremely low . 
  yeah , had chernobyl been in portugal , and today i would glow green in the dark . 
  because it is .
