disgusting , they 'll take uk jobs and stab their women . 
  hopefully we can stop the sharks . 
  thats an hybrid ... submarine during the day an airplane during the night . 
  its always illegal to download , but no meaningful action will be taken as long as you 're not mass storing and sharing . 
  this is the south problem , socialists still hold too much power , i do n't want them to disappear as they have a few points i want them to keep fighting for , but socialists governing a country is scary . 
  as long as you do n't stream it yourself . 
  only the one putting the stream up is commiting a crime . 
  watching is n't illegal , streaming it is , downloading is . 
  just do n't use it near children , we do n't want them to hear that dirty language . 
   city is cool - we 're the cool kids that stole from the dublin nerds , haha take that gnomes !, 
  its not the hijab , its head wear , any head wear, 
  thank god , you would n't want british hookers !, 
  college doesnt cure stupidity . 
  been there , seen it . 
  uk is 6th behind france , germany and italy are also in the top 10 . 
  but they are sharing them over facebook , with random people , i doubt they know all the 700 facebook friends , if not more than 700 if the account is public . 
  was an example , you clearly did n't understood sadly . 
  hold my beer , i 'm going down the street to kill some brazilian families and open some space for some of my white brothers . 
  - yes the problem is your xenophobic media and politicians . 
  also the huge amount of cunts in that country . 
  but trump went to a black church he 's not racist at all !, 
  - trump supporters - sounds like a good man to me . 
  i 'm sure there were slaves that would love their masters cuz they had food and would n't be beaten everyday , so in their eyes comparing to what was next door it was a good standard of life it does n't mean they do n't deserve better and it sure does n't mean that 's what they really want , the thing is most of this people did n't have real freedom to willingly choose , to them since they were born that was the norm . 
  if you never experience something you do n't really know if you want it or not . 
  - an example is north korea , people since they were born live nothing more than the tale of the great leader , most of them believe they actually have a great quality of life , do they want it ? 
  they do . 
  do they have any other choice ? 
  in reality they do n't , cuz they do n't know any other option nor can they take it . 
  - i do n't mean tht if they have a choice they will 100 % sure live like we do , they wont obviously , what i believe tho is that those countries should have the freedom to decide without fear . 
  with that said , i 'll always be against land troops in other countries affairs , we may support one side tho . 
  - edit : instead of downvoting if you do n't agree tell me why , or downvote and then tell me why i 'm wrong . 
  aw stop it you , everyone 's looking at us from space this year . 
  - on a side note , help us . 
  they do n't care about facts it really sad , your suggestion would 100 % solve the poor issue its impossible to deny it . 
  psoe went full extreme left it seems , from the outside at least , so the only real option for pp is ciudadanos , they 're probably hoping to elect 7 more deputies in a third election and its set . 
  i doubt any of the smaller parties would join pp since a lot of them are for independence and whatnot , something pp will never follow . 
  - or at least this is the general idea i have from the media here . 
  lets hope juncker does n't come to portugal anytime soon . 
  fuck , now you 'll make me google why are the british crybabies again ... 
  we 're famous , damn right we are !, 
  most probably they did . 
  trump elected plus a few extreme parties in eu would only benefit 2 countries , and we all know which . 
  i was being sarcastic , guess i should 've used / s , thought it was obvious . 
  doubt it , russia would n't do something like that , next thing you 'll say they 're funding extreme parties all over europe . 
  c'mon galicia , why are you still with spain ? 
  we 're basically soulmates . 
  the article is 2 weeks old but for some reason it appeared again on my news feed , was n't here so i thought might aswell share . 
  percentage should n't have changed much unless some huge fire occured recently . 
   in the eu the burnt area was of 218651 hectares while in portugal alone was 116833 . 
  portuguese association of protection and civil security says it is impossible no matter how capable , effective , organized and competent an operational unit to give an optimized answer to this level . 
  that 's mostly it , it then suggests measures that could help but that no government will implement cuz too many people make money out of it . 
  also mentions spain has 14 % . 
  wales was also heavily supported by eu and they voted leave , shows that there 's incredibily stupid people everywhere and not just the uk, 
  they said continental europe tho , probably thinking of germany/netherlands, 
   `` japanese businesses with their european headquarters in the uk may decide to transfer their head-office function to continental europe if eu laws cease to be applicable in the uk after its withdrawal , '' you 're more than welcomed . 
  we have none so you can finish your trip in spain kind sir . 
  or the longest global empire , and spanish empire , but ye , been a long time , but not thaaaaat long . 
  lets make greece pay for a wall , it 'll be yuuuge , believe me !, 
  but as a society you just want less criminals and the few that exist you 'd want them reformed . 
  i think norway is doing well , personal revenge should n't get in the way of the greater good for everyone . 
  cmon ... first you show me what room i could get ( honestly looks better than mine ) now you offer me a free prostitute every week , i might just stab you . 
  because its a peace index , not safety , and the us are nowhere near to being peaceful . 
  because its ** peace ** index not safety , the title is misleading . 
  this has nothing to do with church and we have a lot of africans here from former colonies . 
  - i do n't care about who 's 4th or 5th honestly , just answering to your ` white christian portuguese ' cuz most people do n't give a damn about church . 
  people should get a reality check in other countries and then maybe they would appreciate the peaceful lives we have here . 
  you have to read the second part of my comment , a problem with a lot of brits , not all , is they act superior to others . 
  w0w people proud of their country , who do they think they are !? 
  / s - as long as they dont bring others down to make themselves feel good i 'm all for being proud of every good aspect of your country . 
  germans are amazing i wish i could participate too but its only for turks , so lucky . 
  you can erasmus my ... meh nothing good to put here . 
  hello , ** tips fedora **, 
  or he 's portuguese , algarve for me its just , meh sun and nice beaches , meh , just the usual thing but a bit better . 
  on the other hand it never snows where i live so if i see some white roofs somewhere i 'll get impressed . 
  i also have a thing for non-brit girls . 
  to build some summer camps and invite the turks i guess . 
  - ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorrygermanbrosjustajokeistillloveyouthoxoxo, 
  he is calling us pigs , that stupid acronym was origined in uk and they were fully aware of the order they gave to letters , just goes to show the amount of xenophobic scum in that island . 
  just retards with short memory dw . 
  its not like they attacked ukraine . 
  russia is so peaceful . 
  flair up boy , what 's your epitome of free country , lets hope it is what i think it is , wan na laugh a bit . 
  dude dont worry , as long as you do n't rush through the main door shouting allahu akbar you 'll be fine , really . 
  i think almost every average person has a car , at least from the people i know , everyone has a car , even if its a shitty one from 1996 . 
  whats up with the random pig there ? 
  is it normal ? 
  and people complain greece only takes from eu , you 're so fucking generous that you drown to make even countries like portugal look not so bad . 
   wont suck your dick for ** low ** tips ftfy , everyone has a price ( \u035d \u00b0 \u035c\u0296\u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  we should switch heatwaves , i 'd gladly have yours . 
  portugal was always high in this kind of index , we 've been declining due to the crisis , but norway is probably a bit better , idk which stat maade it go so low . 
  you do n't get it , if we give you the same conditions after leaving what would be the eu worth for ? 
  i mean if you can leave and keep everything you had and opt out some more stuff ... that 's just fueling the euroskpetical parties to rise everywhere . 
  - and yes i 'd cut off my nose if it saved all the rest . 
  no , what we all want is uk ending up with a way worse deal than when they were part of eu . 
  tbh canada is cool . 
  you know that if you join the single market after brexit you will still have all those eu laws ? 
  erdogan ` failed ' that one . 
  wow ... look at the brexit campaign and then look back at your comment . 
  what ?!, 
  no ty , i rather leave in my poor country where i only get enough to survive but i feel safe and happy , than living in a growing and rich country but have to watch other citizens die to islamic extremists .
