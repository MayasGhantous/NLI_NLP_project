  a team of local women run the kitchen , and they too modify their menu based on what the farms are growing , but a near constant is roasted kid with stewed potatoes and grilled alheira , a fowl-and-bread stuffed sausage . 
  according to my waitress , it was portuguese jews who first made alheira , during the years of the inquisition , so that they could `` prove '' their christianity if necessary by eating a secretly pork-free sausage ( jewish dietary laws prohibit eating pork ) . 
  fact or fable , i could n't help thinking that nearly every dish i ate during this feeding frenzy in the douro came with a back story , and then i remembered something rui martins said to me a few days earlier : `` history is an ingredient in every recipe we cook in the douro , whether it 's newly invented or centuries old . '', 
  it 's rather obvious , is n't it ? 
  well the council of europe is also not europe . 
  but just like au , has most of its continent in it . 
  [ well , that 's not very exact ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_african_union ), 
  people were easily jailed and killed for the simple fact of having books about it . 
  you have the least representative parliament in the entire continent thanks to your electoral system . 
  you should be the one worried with the fact that it 's so easy for a minority to get full power in britain even if they 're far from representing half of the population . . 
  the eu parliament is more representative of the uk voters than your national parliament . 
  just look to ukip 's group in one and the other ... 
  it 's like a disaster in slow motion ... and it can still be avoided , just quite a few people on several positions and countries need to swallow some pride and be a bit more pragmatic . 
  scary stuff . 
  but if they have an antidote in brazil why are we not importing that ? 
  was n't this the big win cameron got from his discussions for a deal to keep in the eu ? 
  this is awesome . 
  but i would say sardegna needs some reinforcements . 
  ps : wow , when you zoom out you can kind of see a world map above it , well , africa is definitely there . 
   it 's borderline insane . 
  and yet it 's still considered one of the countries with the most religious freedom in the world . 
  you do realize very few countries have separation between state and church , right ? 
  it 's far from being the norm , even in europe . 
   i say that what that guy did is a crime in portugal . 
  i do n't see how . 
  he did n't insult a person for their religion . 
  he mocked a religion . 
  different things . 
  i 'm not saying the law is perfect , i merely explained what it said as the person that quoted it did not explain it correctly . 
  and i think you could argue in court that this law could indeed be used to protect an atheist that was mocked for being an atheist . 
  which again is a different story than mocking atheism for instance . 
  portugal does n't have a blasphemy law and has separation of state and church , even if not enforced as strongly as in france . 
  the quoted law is a law against insulting people for their religion or vandalizing temples . 
  the quoted protuguese article says explicitly `` insulting someone for their religion '' . 
  that is very different from `` insulting a religion '' . 
  no is not . 
  the text you quoted is rather clear . 
  `` insulting someone for their religion '' . 
  i find it hilarious that you missed to understand that the portuguese code addresses the issue of insulting someone for their religion or vandalizing a temple or cemetery . 
  in no way does it forbid from mocking a religion . 
  actually i do n't find it hilarious , i find it tragic that people keep make the confusion between religion and people , people have rights , people should n't be discriminated against . 
  and then again , even the portuguese law forbade blasphemy it would be no impediment for me to share this link . 
  why should it be ? 
  the inquisition comes centuries after independence . 
  and it was a demand to introduce it as part of an agreement about a royal wedding with a spanish princess . 
   we had no protestants . 
  there were a few , and a few were killed . 
   secular democracy should lead by example . 
  i agree with you . 
  still , my gut feeling differs . 
  yeah , in portugal was always catholics killing protestants , never the other way around . 
  what !, 
  i could n't find anywhere their definition of `` child marriage '' . 
  seems to me suspiciously high in some countries , such as cuba . 
  do they consider any marriage bellow 18 a child marriage ? 
  no idea , it 's not mentioned anywhere . . it 's not even clear if it 's the same age limit to all countries . 
  maybe cause the consequences are quite different to boys and girls ? 
  maybe because teen pregnancy fucks up your career/education prospects . . 
  why is the eu being anti-democratic ? 
  the eu always warned about the consequences of the vote and kept its position . 
  `` no free market without free movement of people '' . 
  the eu has been very much in favor of respecting the result of the vote , ca n't be more democratic than this .

  one of the most surprising and emotional post-brexit moments were those [ demonstrations in london ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7564572-3x2-700x467.jpg ) with people waving the european flag . 
  i 'm sure i was not the only one crying a little tear ... 
  seriously ? 
  why ? 
  tell us your story . 
  hurt pride or something else ? 
  i already used [ them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polymer_banknote ) in some countries and i really like them . 
  all in favor of polymer euros . 
  we do n't need new laws nor new politicians , we just need to current laws to be applied . 
  we need law and order not matter the race/religion of those breaking it . 
  creating alternative separate blocks inside europe is a seed for future wars . 
  sometimes distance help people to have more rational and less passionate decisions . 
  only irrational passion can explain a vote for trump . 
  on the other extreme of the continent , portugal is the country that gives clinton the biggest edge over trump : 80 % . 
  that 's why joining jihad does n't sound so bad in sweden ... 
  feels good to be a world leader , but this is actually a bad thing , a terrible thing . 
  or he can imitate these guys who [ put a portuguese flag at oliven\u00e7a 's castle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzyvaailryo ) hehehe, 
  ok , i was just wild guessing , i 've been to finland , but do n't remember how the coffee was to be honest , not a big drinker myself . . i mean , drink it everyday , but do n't care so much to be honest , any dark water will do the trick . 
  ahahaha i must try it, 
  certainly , but if pulls off the plug of electronic device replacing the bells at max he gets kicked out from the church ... if the device gets damaged he would get prosecuted and would have to pay for the damages . 
  in portugal coffee is synonym of expresso , i 'm impressed it still makes it to the list . 
  quite sure in finland they drink liters of watery `` americanos '' ... 
  finland , focus on quality , not quantity . 
  you might end up not sleeping right and that will make you grumpy and unable to socialize . 
  that 's far less to the us than normally perceived on the media ... 
  oh religion ... we often forget how blessed we are for living in such a little religious continent . 
  and even so . 
  this is why these things should always be state-controlled , with clear rules and criteria about over population . 
  but it 's a waste to eventually the state to pay for technicians to control overpopulation when it could profit from it . 
  not knowing the specifics about romania , it 's not hard to imagine some species grow too much on given points . 
  hunting can be a very interesting source of investment even in almost-rich countries like romania . 
  used wisely hunting can be a great tool to preserve nature and ensure economic development for people in rural areas .
