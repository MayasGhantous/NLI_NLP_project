  i meant my country . 
  i want my oranges back nonetheless . 
  brother have a hug and a pastel de nata to help you overcome that , 
  apparently also greek and arabic , enough !, 
  i want my country back !, 
   the word for `` orange '' is \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 ( burtuqaal [ remember that we do not have a `` p '' in arabic , and it usually becomes a `` b '' when we borrow foreign words ] ) . 
   in fact , greek has the same difference ( roughly ) in the two words :  orange is \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 ( portokali )  portugal is \u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 ( portogalia ) source : the internet, 
  romanian , albanian , persian ... edit : persian , not farsi . 
  they use portugal to call oranges in a bunch of languages , we should also make them stop it . 
  my country my rules !, 
  that 's so patronizing and incredibly lusophobic in so many ways ... past\u00e9is de feij\u00e3o are by far a superior choice . 
  you would know that if lusophobia would n't have made you so short sighted . 
  oh so i guess all was fine and non-racist at all then . 
   `` skin racism '' is a western really ? 
  what about slavery ? 
  and why did the ottoman empire banned white slavery before black slavery ? 
  hmm ... 
  funny how not so long ago wanting to host the olympics sounded populistic while nowadays is quite the opposite , not wanting the olympics is the populistic position . 
  in this case i 'm with the populists , organizing the olympics is a complete waste of money and for a city like rome does n't bring any added value . 
  let some new city get some recognition from that , rome does n't need it . 
  dude if you want your view to be respected first you have to give it a fancy name like lusophobia . 
  now it 's ok , you can accuse northerners of being lusophobic , they 'll be scared with the accusation and start thinking on ways to compensate for that . 
  soon sardines and codfish will be available in all supermarkets and loudspeakers will spread fado through the streets of nasty lusophobic northern europe . 
  maybe one day they 'll understand ... 
  it sounded real russian to me lol, 
  problem again is that many are legitimate refugees that ca n't go back home , and are forced to wait for months in these camps without end in sight . 
   if they choose to be resettled in png quite sure that in the case of economic migrants going back home sounds a much better perspective . 
  here , you can [ still catch on with the news ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention ) . 
  and now you 're being lazy and rude . 
  keep on . 
  if you look closely the link you used you 'll find at least 2 , but that 's not the main point anyway . . 
  great , thanks , 
  so many wrong perceptions though on the other ranking . . this reminds me of that one about corruption , where northern countries perceive less corruption than what they have and southern countries perceive much more . 
  stereotypes are powerful stuff . . 
  unfortunately it was removed . 
  maybe you can post it with your translation , 
  is it the same channel ? 
  in that case definitely !, 
  i was not comparing . 
  just noticing the girl priorities : burkini and french riviera , coming all the way from australia . . wow while her country sends syrian refugees to nauru . 
  merci !, 
  i think most people support the policy , it has proven successful , there was a huge drug problem in portugal in the 90s . 
  we just fear all the publicity about it . . drugs are not legal , just decriminalized . 
  on another note , it 's fascinating that an australian family flies all the way from australia over countries like saudi arabia or syria to complain about discrimination in a few french beaches ... 
  fascinating also that this gets covered by an australian channel , the country that sends asylum seekers to concentration camps offshore . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53pfyf/australian_tv_channel_fakes_burkini_persecution/ ), 
  you can see [ the complete australian report here ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunday-night/features/a/32638445/the-moment-a-muslim-woman-is-threatened-for-wearing-a-burkini-on-a-beach/?utm_content=buffer561d9&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer#play ) . 
  however the french newspaper nice matin found some people shown on the report that have a very different version of the events : people complained and kicked out the tv crew for filming children without their parents permission and this was the reason a parent called the police . 
  according to the same witnesses nobody said anything to the burkini-women present . 
   he is probably more of a genuine europhile that 's definitely true . 
  also comparing him with the previous one , barroso , he has 100 % more character and personality ; he 's not just a puppet politician looking for a nice job . 
   i think the overabundance of articles regarding portugal 's drug policy is bound to bring unwanted attention . 
  i fear the same . 
  plus in the meanwhile there are a few countries with similar policies i think , time to report on those . . and remember : drugs are not legal in portugal , you just wo n't go to jail for consuming , but you can go easily to jail for dealing . 
  thanks . 
  merci !, 
  what 's the name of the doc ? 
   so her religion is rude to them ? 
  our customs are rude to her . 
  oh the always renewed islamic fundamentalism ... 
   mainly because it 's disrespectful that 's an interesting point that people tend to forget , at least in the iberian peninsula it 's regarded as impolite and rude not to uncover your head once you 're indoors . 
  i remember seeing once an american guy at the border in the airport getting all annoyed cause the border police was telling him to take off his hat for starts . 
  so this is indeed a strong tradition/social rule , even if people do n't think much about it , it 's just intuitive most of the times . 
  portugal looks depressing ... everyone 's leaving . 
  ah ok , got it , 
  depends on the calendar , often sundays are presented as the first day , which makes more sense . 
  i learned to like it as it 's original . 
  i also have a laugh when often in calendars and [ even in newspapers ] ( http://imagens.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/2016/09/09/publico/publico-20160909.jpg?tp=arquivo ) the days of the week are shortened to the first 3 letters , makes sexta-feira ( friday ) extra fun . 
  once i was showing my calendar to a scandinavian colleague to agree on a date and she asked me `` so you always have sex on the same day of the week ? '' i had a huge laugh when i finally understood what she meant ... ahah it also saves you letters when you want to write them on a sms or something : 2\u00aa , 3\u00aa , 4\u00aa and so on ... 
  the same in portugal , feira is feira , n\u00e3o festival :p, 
  of course they 're not different . 
  they 're just more directly affected by homophobia , which makes it stupid to support homophobic parties . 
  but yeah , gays can be homophobic too . 
  a foreign prisoner is not necessarily a resident , criminals also travel . . 
  oh for christ sake , it 's ukip we 're talking about . 
  get real , that kind of denial it 's what led this guy there and now into full regret/treason ( depending on the angle you see it ) . 
  of course . 
  i 'm a immigrant myself and in favor of migration caps . 
  still i did not join , nor intend to , a xenophobic party . 
  you may not want to see the obvious and you 're free to do so , but the ukip is a xenophobic party . 
  i would write the same thing about a gay in a conservative party ... of course in the end people are free to join parties that advocate against their own rights , but it 's still stupid . 
  forever an indian for the ukip crowd . 
  no chance of ever becoming a brit on their eyes ... 
   how exactly did he do it ? 
  by joining and helping and legitimizing a party that actually promotes xenophobia and racism . 
   within the party , i progressed very rapidly and before i knew it i was sitting in the european parliament in brussels alongside farage and the others . 
  if you think about it it 's actually very easy for someone from a racial minority to become a mascot of some far right party and get a dream job as mep in brussels . 
  all you have to do is to betray the interests of your own people . . but it 's a damn good job . 
  they came directly from west africa to portugal and portugal accepted them and they are well integrated . 
  that question does not apply . 
  sorry my bad , was on my phone and mixed with the other user . 
   as nothing would change . 
  you defend the biggest political change in your country after the wwii and then smilingly state that nothing would change . 
  yep , you 're the dutch farage . 
  will you also apply for a german passport afterwards ? 
  me neither , but that made some sensation on / r/portugal some time ago ... but it 's true that there 's probably less sex these days on day-time tv , i still remember when rtp2 would air sex scenes from some alternative drama series immediately after their children 's programs around 7pm ahahah oh the sweet 90s . 
  or malta , andorra , san marino , monaco ... luxembourg is actually huge among the tiny ones . 
  are you kidding ? 
  they show vaginal plastic surgery on morning tv ... `` re-youthening techniques '' ... 
  you argue in favor of your country to leave the entire legal framework on international trade built during past decades , objectively going into a blank legal area that no one can honestly say how it would be filled eventually ( therefor creating uncertainty and fear with obvious economic consequences ) , and then you go on to simply say that that would not be an issue .
