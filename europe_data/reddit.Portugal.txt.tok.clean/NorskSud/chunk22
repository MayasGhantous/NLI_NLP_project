  what about tapas and a job ? 
  tapas are everywhere . . 
  we can into the balkans !, 
  edit : hermanos of spain . . you know that when you ca n't find a job in your hometown you can always try elsewhere , right ? 
  there 's still paella beyond the pyrenees ... 
  so will you guys finally join the interrail ? 
  and this fraudster wants to become president of the republic . 
  go away you scammer , go lick trump 's or putin 's asses so they can pay your debts ... 
   the loss of the uk should have been seismic for the union exits that would be immediate end of the eu : germany or france . 
  exits that would be seismic : netherlands , belgium , italy , spain . 
  exits that would be traumatic , but not life threatening to the eu : almost everyone else . 
  exits that maybe nobody would notice : malta and cyprus . 
  exit that everyone is tired of listening to for decades now : the uk . 
  for decades that most europeans see the uk as an obstacle for the eu advancement . . the one that is always against , the one without a positive idea forward . . half in and half out . 
  no wonder immediately after the referendum the reaction was : chaos in london and calm in brussels : `` we 're sad , but here is the door , bye '' . 
  the uk built up this scenario for decades , not the eu . 
   canada canada has indeed a much stronger case than australia to join the eu . 
   also thought there would be more brazilians than angolans in portugal . 
  there are , but there are thousands of portuguese who were born in angola , i think that 's the issue here ... 
  [ cows always know what 's best ] ( http://static.globalnoticias.pt/storage/oj/2012/big/ng1974029.jpg?type=big ) ... 
  corvo and flores , all the rest is europe . 
  yeah sure , they do n't do it for the money , they do it mostly to please you . . such angels . 
  but is n't trump going to end nafta as well ? 
  it was ok ... but still an egg in a cocktail glass ... :p, 
  thanks for the info , 
  your definition of metropolitan area seems quite far reaching ... the entire luxembourg or cyprus falling into one means that deeply rural areas count as such ... 
  if this index was about restaurants i guess the difference would be even higher , much higher probably . 
  i still remember paying 40 $ for an egg last time in switzerland . . pff . . on an mountain hut . 
  i guess this is about food you buy in the supermarket , not restaurants , that 's a different story . 
  this only proves once again that the japanese bow is the best greeting fashion in the world . 
   if it was n't for the 1755 lisbon earthquake the portuguese empire decline started long before that , when a 16 old kid raised by monks and therefor a complete religious fanatic became king and decided that we could n't tolerate a muslim country right south of us and tried to invade morocco never to be seen again . 
  the next in succession was his cousin king of spain ... 
  thanks for the info , quite cool that you can pick a bigger one . 
  that it was a suicide is much less relevant than it seems to this story , or since when we established that we do n't try to stop suicides ? 
  it is , as thousands of swedes volunteered and you have no idea who 's going to pick up . 
  for the `` real '' randomness you do n't need a campaign like this , just a public phone list . . 
  say what you want , but northern portugal is the best portugal . 
  someone that agreed to participate in a campaign where you can receive phone calls from random people from around the world ? 
  the random swede thing is not a swede from the phone list , it 's a swede that agreed to participate in this . 
  i 'm not sure , i believe it was like that the first time i renewed , that they had a different fee for people not presenting the old one . 
  that 's no longer the case , on the website they just [ mention that one needs to report the missing passport ] ( http://www.pep.pt/pagespt/faq/faq22.aspx ) . 
  but in this case it only makes it more stupid that they do n't simply let people keep the old ones . . and again , apparently it varies , at the embassies that 's not an issue ... 
  i remember the polemic , never really understood it though . . it 's not like ids are so full of information . 
  well actually the new portuguese one is ( includes tax and health info , all in one card ) , but still , in general they are not and they do n't have to be . 
  they 're a cheap and easy-to-carry alternative to passport , enough for european travels ... 
  i wonder how different could be the british relation with europe if british people were used to travel without needing a passport and even better , without having to show it ( if you were schengen ) . 
  reality is , it 's not so different traveling to spain than to the us from the uk . . but that was always a uk decision . 
  it looks amazing , ca n't wait for the day of a completely standardized eu passport , with just a code for the country ( pt , se etc ) in some discreet corner . . 
  well the brexit deal needs unanimity , so each of the 27 can make up their own set of demands and requests . . 
  the ferry was coming from barreiro , south margin , with 561 passengers on board . 
  34 people needed medical assistance after a strong shock with the pier when arriving to lisbon . 
  no serious injuries are reported for now . 
  ok , i always renewed mine within date . . always some stupid country demanding passport with minimum validity of 6 months :p, 
  i hope that 's only for emergency passports . . 
  you do n't need it to serbia but need it to moldova ? 
  but actually moldova should be an appealing destination for romanians , no ? 
  at least for personal/family reasons . . 
  just loosing it will cost you more to renew it . 
  on the other hand i learnt recently that you get the old back when you renew it at the embassy -- at least in luxembourg -- as they do n't have a `` documents destruction facility '' , and the only thing they do to the old one is to stamp it with `` anulado '' . 
  while last time i renewed it in portugal they immediately stamped it and made 2 holes on it and still said i could n't keep it due to `` security reasons '' -- would only open an exception if i had a still valid visa inside , which was not the case . 
  ouch . 
  and let me guess , your holiday was in some european country where an id card would be sufficient if the uk issue them ? 
  :p edit : also i thought that with all these biometric features on passports photos were always taken in the passport office , that 's with the portuguese one at least . 
  the machine will measure your height , take some biometric data and make your photo . 
  you can try a few times the photo if you 're not happy with the result , that you see directly on the screen . 
  i made mine for the first time in an embassy outside portugal , it 's the same system/machine plus a surcharge of 10 $ for being abroad . 
  makes traveling outside the eu even more inaccessible to many people . 
  ukraine is not so far from romania for instance , and it 's cheaper than going west ... 
  did trump built his towers by himself ? 
  has he visited all his properties ? 
  i think they 're planning to make it last 10 , but as far as i know it 's 5 years now independently of your age . 
   brits want their blue passports back . 
  european blue is the best , you should [ go for that ] ( http://cor.europa.eu/en/documentation/brochures/publishingimages/eu-passport.jpg ) . 
  how much does it cost ? 
  the portuguese costs 65 $ for a 5 year validity ... :(, 
  was not a joke , congo was indeed a farm of leopold . 
  long live guernsey and manx !, 
  lol, 
  biggest investor in africa by far for quite a few years , been buying all sorts of stuff in europe such as the entire portuguese electric grid or the ports in greece ... 
  my point was - and it 's subjective of course - there is these days a more visible and active catholic movement in france today than in spain or portugal and with a much heavier political weight . 
  this is discussible of course , but i really ca n't find any iberian parallel to the `` manif pour touts '' . . and certainly not opus dei . 
  just being realist here . 
  i do n't believe much on the domino effect , for decades that the uk is perceived as having one foot in and one foot out . 
  but it would definitely be gone if the uk dissolves . 
  let the people have their country back ... :p, 
  catholicism is definitely more influent in france than in the iberian peninsula ... already for some years . 
  just compare the resistance to same-sex marriage in both areas . 
  the dissolution of the uk due to brexit would be the best insurance against the eu dissolution . 
   vatican , pope francis , 10\u00a0300\u00a0000 in this case you should add up his other official accounts , in [ spanish +12,5 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_es ) , in [ portuguese +2.46 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_pt ) , in [ french +0.728 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_fr ) , in [ german + 0.428 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_de ) and in [ arabic +0.355 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_ar ) - hope i 'm not missing any . 
  that would be a total of 26.77 m , althouhg of course some people might be following more than one account . . 
  if you just want to consider one , than the spanish version should be the one considered . 
  edit : forgot the obvious ones , [ latin +0.747 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_ln ) and [ italian +4.16 m ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_it )  and [ polish +0.763 ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex_pl ) so a total of 32.5 m. 
  watch out ronaldo !, 
  the coins are probably fake too . 
   gives me change for 1.07 eur , those 3 cents you mean 2 cents, 
  money makes her schedule , that 's why she was at trump tower the other day . 
  she 's very predictable , just like her dad , politics is a family business . 
   dismiss these people at your own risk . 
  i think the problem was precisely all the media attention trump got even when he was still far behind on all polls to become the republican candidate . 
  so yeah , i 'm fed up of seeing all the undeserved attention going to these creeps .
