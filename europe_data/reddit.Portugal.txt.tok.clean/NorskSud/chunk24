  edit : example , for portugal someone in a civil union in some other eu country is a single person , as portugal does n't recognize civil unions ( gay or straight for that matter ) . 
  states are free to create and/or recognize family unions . 
   before we have decades of proof from western countries we already have that . 
  plenty of literature on the issue from the us . 
  go and read if you care so much . 
   is this just a matter of symbol ? 
  if you want things to change in poland you need many symbolic actions like this one . 
  it does n't fall from the sky this kind of conquest . 
  that must happen everyday in latvia , i imagine ... traffic jams due to gay parades ... lol, 
   from deep prehistoric times ( when it was `` invented '' ) at least you 're not saying it was created by god . 
  baby steps . 
  that 's true what you say about spain and explains the better position they are now . 
  we on the other hand had [ a war from 1961-1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) , very costly on human and financial resources and that lead to growing isolation and sanctions . . 
  where it says `` mcnamara 's home '' should say instead `` moved to luxembourg '' :p, 
  if you want to make that kind of comments use the correct flag . 
  galicians are bros , you 're just a spaniard . 
  i upvoted as all these crappy maps managed to get to the front but somehow if it 's the israeli version it gets seriously downvoted . 
  but still , quite pissed with the total absence . . not even a fucking '' ? '' . . 
  jeez . . 
  sadly everyone 's favorite part of alentejo seems to be oliven\u00e7a :p, 
   systemic corruption , political instability i already lived in a few different european countries and that is nothing exceptional . 
  since portugal is a democracy there is plenty of political stability on most big issues . 
  corruption levels are closer to countries further north than further south . . 
  there are no miracles , 50 years of fascism + 13 of colonial war take their toll . 
  still paying it . 
  this is gdp though , in actual wealth the average portuguese is still wealthier than most eastern europeans , even if not by big distance and overtaken already by a few countries . 
   it is not comparable to what the east went through why ? 
  in economic terms the fascist dictators were actually much worse , as they had no investment in industry or education . 
  it 's no surprise to me that eastern countries progress much faster than the southern ones , where there was no free economy and also no education , no health , no big industries . . 
   skipped the worst parts of wwi and wwii to compensate that we had a colonial war in africa till 1974 , that was the only public investment being done during those decades and killed thousands of our youngsters . 
  considering how portugal was in 1974 and how it got in the 2000 's it 's a remarkable progress . 
  of course the all thing pretty much got stuck since we joined the euro though . . 
  like all statistics relating to luxembourg this should be read with a grain of salt , [ a huge portion of workers in luxembourg live across the border ] ( http://www.wort.lu/en/business/greater-region-close-to-180-000-cross-border-workers-in-luxembourg-58664a1e53590682caf17077 ) , so although they do contribute to the gdp they do n't count when it comes to estimate the gdp per capita ... edit : link, 
  our current prime minister , and former mayor of lisbon , is of goan origin -- it was mostly a non-issue , a curiosity at max , during his political career . 
  right after our revolution ( 1974 ) , when all former colonies became independent and diplomatic relations with india were restored indian movies were very popular in portugal , at least that 's what my parents say . 
  there 's no hard feelings whatsoever because of that episode , even because the wars in africa lasted much longer and were more recent , are much more present in the collective memory than that one in goa . 
  in the eu i guess it 's hungary , right ? 
  i mean the government , not the country , countries change direction all the time . . 
  but that 's in the mountains . . maybe it did snow . 
  malta i did forget though :p sorry, 
   so if she did n't get citizenship she must leave switzerland ? 
  nope , she 's a schengen citizen and switzerland is in the schengen area , so she has the same rights as a swiss citizen , including residency rights . 
  only voting rights may differ . 
  funny , 100 % free of snow countries seem to be only pt , ie , nl and dk . 
  who would have guessed ... 
  there are many swiss vegans btw . 
  not all swiss think alike . 
  just keep on the valley , be aware of the vertigo !, 
   a country sucks at this even if it has huge forests and does not need any kind of reforestation because they never stopped caring for them ? 
  in that case you should invade iceland and reforest there . 
  10 yeas of residency is not a subjective criteria , you either fulfill it or you do n't . 
  you can say that some people with 7 years are more `` national '' than others with 12 years , that 's your subjective opinion . 
  but the legal criteria is clear as water . 
  free websites try to publish as much content as possible , as that increase views . 
  plus it 's an interesting story , even if you 're in kansas . 
  [ we just sent our pm to location ] ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugals-babush-returns-to-the-land-of-his-father/articleshow/56463870.cms ) to ensure that this exchange will be fruitful . 
   is normally bound by a bunch of provisos exactly , but these tend to or at least should be clear in the law , not just based on the opinions of the neighbors , that might be moved by personal sympathy or antipathy or far worse motivations ... the law should be more clear than this . 
  this opens room for any sort of criteria ... 
  in this case they seem to use the `` jus neighbourinis '' , which is the scary part . 
  [ not always a smile ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bmrxy-jb9_u/?taken-by=antoniocostapm&amp;hl=pt ) , 
  + used to see mountains on a daily basis , definitely not dutch . 
  have you seen [ ant\u00f3nio costa 's one ] ( https://www.instagram.com/antoniocostapm/?hl=pt ) , he has many relaxed shots as well . . 
  law-abiding citizen that lived most of her life in switzerland , seems to be linguistically mostly swiss ... she even moved there as a child , so not really a conscious/free choice to become a swiss , it 's just a fact of her life . 
  that 's tidier . . 
   yes priotorising french jews , but not because they 're jews but because of the doing of the french and israelien government . 
  or to sum up your opinion , yes they were targeted because they were jews but does n't matter cause israel . 
  brilliant . 
  the portuguese one would be like this : everyone talking at the same time , no one listening to others -  general disagreement and distrust -  clock is ticking -  somebody out of the blue has a never before discussed wacky idea -  suddenly everyone is on board to do it ( many loose ends though ), 
  they 're [ all women btw ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qnm9imummog/vzm1b1punyi/aaaaaaaax2m/9lexdueg3sg/s1600/25.jpg ) , 
   no they 're not . 
  and then you proceed to mention attacks that are not the ones that i said that are statistically relevant . 
  there are actually [ statistics about this ] ( http://hatecrime.osce.org/france ) , so yeah , a jew has much higher chances of being a hate crime victim in france than a muslim or a christian . 
  much much higher , do n't forget to divide the higher number of crimes targeting jews by the smaller jewish population . 
   it 's not a small one at all . 
  it 's less than half a million , a fraction of a minority as the muslims , and yet much more often a target of hate crimes . 
  portugal 's one on a [ human landscape ] ( http://www.citylifemadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-06-rtxomhz.jpg ) :p, 
  average for last 4 years it 's statistically more relevant than a single year , so yeah , better than spain , 
  the same does n't happen with the jewish communities in the us for instance . 
  in germany it has been growing even - often with israelis that move there . . 
  considering how small the jewish community is , these attacks are statistically relevant . 
  and these are only the deadly ones . 
  jews in france are harassed on a daily basis , both by the far right and arab gangs . 
  synagogues need especial protection , there 're always armed police around . 
  so yeah , the climate is far from being the best for visibly jewish people . 
  total randomness is the only rule of this map . 
  who makes all the `` fat kids '' in lybia ? 
  the `` heavy women '' from egypt ? 
  they should all go to chad to find the `` healthiest diets '' . 
  i mean , our cork is nice , but you should definitely try our wines . 
  development indexes and well-being indexes are still far better comparisons than gdp ones . . and europe always outdoes the us there . 
  funny thing is that if you look up the etymology of the word you find that it actually derives from the word `` south '' , so you 're right , not so east , but definitely not north ahah, 
  if you guys dislike being east so much here is a clue , change your name to nortonia . 
  like it is sounds incredibly eastern . 
  and then again , what 's wrong about that ? 
  we 're called `` mediterranean '' and we do n't even touch that lake ... 
  although sometimes you see some polish invasion in f\u00e1tima ... but that 's ufo controlled anyway, 
  this visit is generating lots of positive articles about portugal in indian media , for example : [ why portugal can be an attractive investment destination for indians ] ( http://www.livemint.com/politics/pbtabhwc9ckabhkc9pcmtp/why-portugal-can-be-an-attractive-investment-destination-for.html ), 
  yes that 's certainly the point . 
  what we lack is the political will , easily-bribable almost-failed states we have quite a few around ... our current policy only feeds more boat tragedies and human trafficking . 
  and that 's generally what european countries are trying to do .
