   these are some pretty low standards [ what ? 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-6118_en.htm )  portugal has already completed 100 % of its ten-t core network for roads , and the quality of the portuguese road infrastructure is rated as the highest in the eu . 
  my mirror disagrees . 
  the map is correct , the portuguese are the hottest . 
  portugal is really living an unique succession of tourism records for the last few years . 
  of course a big part of that is due to the tourism crisis in all northern africa and middle east that limits short trips for european tourists . 
  but it 's also starting to attract big numbers of non-european tourists , which is a new thing ( with the exception of brazilians and angolans ) . 
  the number of articles about portugal in travel magazines recently is not out of pure luck , there has been lots on investments and the trend is real . 
  little known fact , portuguese is the language with the most native speakers in the southern hemisphere . 
  and by the way , projections predict that it will have more speakers in africa than in brazil before 2050 . 
  the difficulty of learning a language always depends on your native one , while french can be extremely difficult to a turk , it 's relatively easy for a portuguese . 
  our favorite country is france , so i guess this poll was made after the euro 2016 , right ? 
  how can mandarin get a better score than portuguese on `` geography '' ? 
  makes no sense . 
  also german n\u00ba8 on that criteria ? 
  a language spoken only between the alps and denmark ? 
  i would say indonesian has a better spread ... especially when you count it as part of malay . 
  and much more speakers ... then `` diplomacy '' , japanese tops portuguese , why ? 
  because of all the japanese speaking countries ? 
  the japanese un sg ? 
  anime ? 
  i love anime , but not sure it counts :p, 
   it happens continually as the water level changes . 
  in area it 's not so significant , since dams are built in valleys . . about the initial drowning , it should normally be cleaned beforehand . 
  but that 's not pollution , that 's an artificial lake . 
  being that lakes ( algae ) can easily produce more o2 than a forest with the same area . 
  no it would n't , a dam breaks destroys lots of housing but they immediately start rebuilding them . 
  i do n't have statistics , but from my memory i can only remember a very serious accident with a dam in europe ( italy ) , despite the fact that you have much more dams than nuclear plants . 
   there is n't `` lots '' of waste , when things go alright , the moment you get a serious accident - and they do happen - you need to evacuate huge areas for decades to come . 
  i 'm glad that at least you do n't have the ambition to ever become part of the government . 
  and that 's good for the country !, 
  your self-hate is ridiculous . 
  nuclear energy can be a disaster anywhere , and was already a disaster in the ussr , the us and japan . 
   in other words if there 's enough mass between you and the waste you 're safe . 
  it 's still more mass than for most kinds of other wastes . 
  and it 's still waste . 
  so there goes the `` cleanest '' argument . 
  lots of waste , lots of mass in order for it not to be lethal . . cleanest , really ? 
  if we consider untreatable waste for centuries to come as clean , of course . 
  and if we disregard the effects of possible accidents , also . 
  if that 's all disregarded then definitely , the cleanest no doubt . 
   nope maybe 'cause people get so infuriated with the statement `` our culture is not perfect '' that they do n't even read the rest ... 
  cyprus you 're following the wrong models , buddy . 
  look west please . 
  your moronic and pointless answer also got upvoted , go figure ... 
  why just europe , washington post ? 
  it 's not like you 've been having so little terrorism in the us lately ... 
  portugal consumes much more fish than the one we 're allowed to fish ( eu quotas and stuff ) , that 's problem number 1 . 
  if you look to our fish-consumption habits they 're closer to far-east asian countries than to europe . 
  so we do fish a lot and we eat it all . 
  codfish was tradionally fished by portuguese in the northern seas , it 's already from 1353 the first agreement with england about portuguese being able to fish in english waters . . but laws changed , crisis happened , and these days it 's not easy for portuguese ships to fish there , so cod is mostly imported . 
  but it 's truly a traditional ingredient from portuguese cuisine , it 's called the `` faithful friend '' , something that in most languages i know is an expression used for dogs . 
  ps : another example , [ this town in canada ] ( http://www.pcsp.ca/?content=visiting/about_our_town/history ) , called portugal cove precisely because was frequently used by portuguese cod fishermen since the 1500 's . . 
  but despite all this love for cod , i would say the national fish is still the sardine . 
  personally i 'm more of a sardine person :p, 
  we knew better back then ... 
  portugal is probably the only country where people associate , before anything else including oil , [ codfish to norway ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o-u_qu89qs ) . 
  the very effective and old slogan `` codfish only from norway '' ( with variations like `` codfish is from norway '' ) became a popular expression whenever the subject is cod . 
  like that it is , traditionally that was just a way of ensuring conservation for long time , including the transport from northern seas to portugal . 
  but the conservation technique alone changes the taste of the fish , and despite the more complicated cooking it demands , it 's the favorite in portugal . 
  you rarely see fresh cod . 
  you sea loads of fresh fish , but not usually cod . 
  traditionally it would also be dried in the sun , but i think that 's not really done anymore . . 
  that one will make you fat . 
  ours is healthy . 
  no , but it 's a real abbreviation , that 's what i mean . 
  i think it was even more used pre-internet . 
  in college words like `` que '' or `` n\u00e3o '' would be shortened that way . 
  but typing a ~ on top of a q is impossible most of the times :p, 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n9emf1n.jpg ) , it 's xmas , nobody should be disappointed . 
  well , it 's still often informally used , the '' \u00f1 '' , as an abbreviation for `` n\u00e3o '' ( no ) . 
  simply we do n't call it a `` letter '' , like our hermanos like to believe , we know it 's just a punctuation mark that we can put on real letters . . \u00e3 , \u00f5 , \u00f1 ... 
  same for us . 
  ears , feet , balls , all fair game . 
  agree , [ this is the real deal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n9emf1n.jpg ) . 
  maybe that sect would have been ideal though . 
  quite a few white portuguese also like to kill their chicken in a crossing or burn some candles for iemanj\u00e1 ... 
  other news mention he had a strong interest in occultism . 
  however nobody reports what was his actual religion . 
  unfortunately some islands had to be excluded from this map due to their lack of talent at producing wine ... : /, 
  well terror can lead to war . 
  if the terror acts in france would lead to a civil war , after that hypothetical war would also look less important and just part of the big picture of the war . . 
  no worries , he failed . 
  we ca n't be sure for anyone , anyone can become a murder eventually . 
   even though they 're as big or bigger than germany . 
  they 're also oversized on most maps , check [ the first maps of this page ] ( http://hotels4hobbies.com/17-maps-will-change-way-look-world-forever/ ) and you 'll see what i mean . 
   keeping latitudes, 
  this reminds me of how good that short-lived tourism slogan from portugal ( [ `` europe 's west coast '' ] ( http://www.meiosepublicidade.pt/2007/12/euro-rscg-biss-lancaster-e-a-novidade-da-promocao-de-portugal-no-exterior/ ) ) was , a pity we left it behind . 
  fortunately dutch guiana is now suriname and portuguese guiana is now amap\u00e1 . 
  spanish guiana though is now guayana , in venezuela , which is still confusing . 
  if after their prison term someone is still a danger for society that means the person has serious mental issues , and should be treated . 
  in the case of breivik his release might also put into question the public order , but that 's something that can only be accessed at that time in the future . 
  he was 32 at the time of his crimes , 25 years later he 'll be 57 , that 's a very different person by then . 
  even his body cells will have been for great part replaced . . 
  it 's also one of the safest and with lower crime rates , so you see , it 's not the high punishment the trick to tackle crime . 
  exactly , it 's a generation , a life . 
  lots of people live fascinating lives in shorter periods . 
  one changes tremendously in 25 years , from a baby to an adult , from young to old ... people are always underestimating how long 25 years are , it 's more than enough . 
  in fact portugal would show much higher if this was a map on `` average of actual prison sentences for murder and other serious crimes '' . 
  you 're underestimating the length of time that 25 years make .
