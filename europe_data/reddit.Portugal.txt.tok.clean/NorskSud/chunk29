  ** 1 ) ** create 2 separate maps for gays and transgender rights , as countries can be much more accepting of one group than the other . 
  yes , i know that these issues are interlinked , but when you think that in iran is legal to change sex but you end up executed by hanging if you have sex with someone of the same sex ... ** 2 ) ** are gay couples equal in rights or not to straight couples ? 
  this is an easy question and requires checking only a few laws in each country : marriage , adoption , medical assisted insemination . 
  ** 3 ) ** anti-discrimination laws can be useful and important , but their need also varies from country to country , they could be used to make some distinction between countries , but they should never be sufficient to put countries with no real equality ( germany , hungary or greece ) above countries with total equality ( luxembourg ) . 
  there are many pairs that make little sense ... 
  i think they should make this much simpler , in fact the number of laws you need for gay couples to have the same rights as straight couples are very few ( marriage , adoption and that 's it ) , then laws about work protection , discrimination protection and so on , are protective laws to be used only in case of need , and that need varies from country to country also . 
  having or not an anti-discrimination amend on one 's constitution does little in the every day life of people . 
  in some countries constitution is more easily changed and amended than others ... and then there are the transgender rights , to add to the confusion . 
  probably would be more useful to have 2 separate maps , even because there are several countries known for being extremely homophobic while being quite tolerant towards transgenderism . 
  it also has to be said that there does n't seem to be much differences on the points you get for each piece of legislation in favor of lgbt rights , which brings awkward results like luxembourg ( a country with same-sex marriage and with a gay pm and a gay vice-pm ) being bellow germany or hungary , countries with no same-sex marriage and no tax equality for gay couples . 
  basically the more legislation you have the more points you get , even if a part of that legislation has little impact when compared to real societal changing laws such as the marriage one . 
  this ( lack of ) criteria clearly makes small countries - that generally produce much less legislation - look worse on the map , even if in practice being a gay in monaco ( 11 % ) is for sure several times more appealing than being a gay in minsk ( 13 % ) . 
  edit : yep , i know , this logic does n't seem to apply to malta that leads the ranking with 88 % , despite being a country with no same-sex marriage !, 
  i think ilga europe should definitely do some work on reading the laws instead of blindly giving points ... 
  they also have much less legislation , so there are less laws about work rights etc in general , so in those fields for the ranking they get zero , which does not necessarily mean that the situation is in fact worse than in countries with those laws . 
  being a gay in monaco ( 11 % ) or a gay in orban 's country side in hungary ( 51 % ) , i 'm quite confident most gays would n't have much doubts picking the first if given the choice :p, 
  personally i 'm still a bit hurt from the / r/brasil vs / r/portugal war [ last summer ... ] ( http://www.brasilpost.com.br/2016/06/14/guerra-memes-portugal-_n_10470072.html ), 
  oops   geringon\u00e7a it is . 
  i 'll use this explanation from [ politico ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/portugals-contraption-creaks-forward/ ) :  the right dismissed the alliance as the geringon\u00e7a , a word that roughly translates as `` contraption '' and implies a complex but flimsy mechanism , barely fit for purpose . 
   the name has stuck . 
  even the left uses it to refer to the alliance which is currently locked in negotiations to draft a 2017 budget that portugal must present to the european commission by october 15 . 
   `` it 's a contraption , but a contraption that works , '' costa gleefully told parliament earlier this year . 
  the portuguese word of the year is still being decided , you can [ vote it here ] ( http://www.palavradoano.pt/ ) . 
  my vote : greingon\u00e7a , the nickname of the new government , that started as an opposition insult but was embraced by the government itself . 
  sure it 's news , in france mostly . 
  but it 's not the biggest news , should not be the dominating news . 
  that 's exactly how trump was always the focus and the one dictating the agenda of the campaign . 
  are we sure we want to repeat the procedure with le pen ? 
  once again the bbc promoting a far-right candidate , just like they did with trump . 
  will they make a news out of each proposal by french candidates ? 
  absolutely not , just the far-right ones . 
  it 's the best system . 
  most people simply never think about the issue , so better to be donor by default , you can always optout if you care so much for your future-dead-body :p, 
  confirm this , in less than 8 hours i 'll be back to it ... :-( better go to bed and sleep a bit . . 
  i think some big differences between countries are precisely because in some you have to sign to be a donor and in others you have to sign not to be one . 
  the second ones have more donors . 
  apathy is a great force . 
  yep , but i meant this magazine . 
  but you wo n't pay more than that in any other eurozone bank machine . 
  bear in mind that it 's different if you try it outside eurozone . 
  from my experience they charge , ing luxembourg card used on an ing machine in holland , but anyway , it 's just the fee you would pay in another bank in luxembourg . 
  i tried changing the language menu to french and some issues seem to be available also in french . 
  but i would n't expect it in all 20 something languages . . 
  assuming the eu lasts forever ... a bit of a risky bet maybe :p, 
  what about the mice ranking ? 
  pertinent question . 
  i passed in helsinki airport in november , and my impression is that there are loads of badasses around ... crowdest airport have been to this here , and that 's quite a few airport , including asian ones . 
  considering how little votes elected trump . . it 's actually not unlikely at all that it was indeed significant . 
  and i understand you meu riquinho . 
  no godwin 's law either :(, 
  origins of the current one , being that the portuguese one changed in 1966 :p, 
  so no one has sharia ? 
  would never have guessed that from the news ... 
  lol says the germanic one that sounds like an arab market seller ... 
  but that wo n't be a referendum on leaving the eu in any case ... so once again , ends up being a national issue that some try to make a `` eu is falling apart '' episode . 
  the changes were approved in parliament but required a referendum . 
  his mistake was to make a bet on his job on it . 
  but foreign media - english media that is - is making a storm out of nothing ... no constitutional change , italy switching governments it 's also business as usual ... english media is desperately looking for countries that follow brexit . . even if there are barely any chances of that happening any time soon . 
  fb should have been banned in the eu long ago for not allowing female nipples while having no problem with male ones . 
  contagion . 
  an then people want more democracy and transparency in the eu ... clearly the trick is to go chinese , lets have a central committee to deal with complicated issues . 
  the most wanted guy by austria is a 60 year old that killed a prostitute in 1984 . 
  so i guess they 're crime problem is under control , no need to elect fascists , 
  and this is the nyt . . seriously , no wonder trump got elected even thought it started as a joke in the republican primaries . 
  the media really pushes for a `` wave '' that would n't exist otherwise . 
  renzi promised not to resign , as far as i know , so nothing changes . 
  italy will go on having the biggest parliament in the world , congrats !, 
  funny that they only did it now considering that their history has a few similar points with kosovo 's . 
  as i said , de facto independence was lost . 
  but that happened during other moments in history as well , such as today . 
  formalities are not a small thing , portugal was much better prepared to become once again de facto independent than catalonia , partially due to that . 
  portugal was never part of spain . 
  important to clarify , it 's restoration and formally the independence was never over . 
  officially they were 2 separate kingdoms with the same king ( with different numeration in each kingdom ) . 
  so it 's a celebration of the restoration of the de facto independence , the official one was never lost . 
  if we compare with the time of the french invasions , it 's fair to say that independence was much further away at that time . 
  the king and court were in rio de janeiro and the country was pretty much being ruled by the british army . 
  compare that with today , no border controls , no own currency etc. . and there we go again , probably less independent today than in 1640 . 
  not that that is a bad thing , just noticing a reality . 
  yep , that 's the supermarket brand , one of the biggest chains . 
  i think from a tourist perspective everything except fuel will look cheaper than in spain and most of europe , but that 's mainly due to cheap labor , that makes things like restaurants very cheap . 
  coffee is also incredibly cheap compared with most countries . 
  rents are also cheap . 
  it 's the vat that often makes stuff more expensive than in other countries , the auto taxes also make cars very expensive . 
  you can try this one https://www.kuantokusta-supermercados.pt, 
  and yet you can still find appalling roads in the interior , i mean municipal roads in terrible terrible state . . 
  quite rich of you to think 60 $ is not a big deal ... 
  not sure what you mean by most things , fuel , tobacco or electricity are not . 
  vat is 23 % and that 's the rate for most stuff , including processed food . 
  public crimes , such as rape , are of mandatory reporting . 
  if you see a rape and walk on you 're an accomplice . 
  this is especially true for a country like luxembourg , that easily has as much non-resident drivers on its roads as residents , if not more ( fuel tourism is still a thing ) . 
  is not really a gender issue , but it 's true that most famous fado singers tend to be women , but as far as i know there were always men singing fado in lisbon . 
  in coimbra it 's different , it 's the `` students fado '' , for centuries only men went to university , so it became a bit of a men thing . 
  but even there i think you find exceptions these days , especially since women are the majority in portuguese universities . 
  you can question whatever you want , and if you know something that proves the guilt of anyone in any crime you 're legally obliged to report it to the authorities . 
  not doing it makes you an accomplice . 
  i know , was just clarifying , 
   jos\u00e9 socrates incidentally this former pm was in prison for a year without accusation , still waiting for one , so your argument about `` the powerful escaping justice '' is actually flawed . 
  my conversation was over .
