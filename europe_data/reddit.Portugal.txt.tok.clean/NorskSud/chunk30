  i 'm not a policeman nor a judge . 
  despise this bs you 're doing here , and completely unrelated to the post . 
  but it 's not official , she 's not on a `` first lady '' role ... he 's there all alone . 
  ooof , and this is why we give points to spain , it 's a matter of national security . 
  his name is marcelo rebelo de sousa , a former law-professor and tv comentator . 
  great , let 's all play police !, 
  but wait , how does that fit into the commenting online under a completely unrelated post ? 
  is this part of the investigation you 're on or it 's just an exercise of defamation to stain someone that , once again , was never accused of anything by the justice ? 
  how is your comment helpful to `` find the truth '' ? 
  and why do n't you trust the justice in this case ? 
  please do n't bother to reply , these are rhetorical questions . 
  i really despise these defamation tactics , especially because they pay off , even with no accusation here is the rumor back to life in a post where he 's not even the main topic , seriously ... 
  lol here [ have this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wixcge8by1c ) by another marcelo rebelo , 
  thanks for quoting the tabloids , the issue was dealt by the police and justice and is now closed . 
  so you 're gratuitously trying to stain the honor and reputation of someone you probably dislike due to politics . 
  unless you were personally witness of any such act , spreading them without any knowledge besides what you read in the right-wing tabloid correio da manh\u00e3 says more about you than about the person in question . 
   nearly got convicted there 's no `` nearly convicted '' , he was not convicted as he was not even accused of anything . 
  he was never in court . 
  please do n't spread bs online , thanks . 
  the [ couples ' pic ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bnxwjmbbq_z/ ) is even sadder ... 
  i like the fact that their visit respectfully ends on the 30th of november , so we can enjoy the [ 1st of december ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_de_vasconcelos ) in peace . 
  remember , remember , the 1st of december !, 
  [ here is the couples ' picture ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bnxwjmbbq_z/ ) for extra pity . 
  war medals from the negotiations with the communists , left block and animal party, 
  on the picture , left to right , the president of the portuguese parliament , the king of spain , the president of portugal , the queen of spain and the portuguese prime-minister .

  which invasion ? 
  kosovo 's or crimea 's . . got confused . 
  and how exactly is kosovo 's case more solid ? 
  shocking !, 
  all public memos have been saying . . wait . . exactly the same ? 
  please do enlighten me of the democratic peaceful one on kosovo 's serbians . 
  anyway , genocide was not the argument for kosovo independence nor integration of crimea in russia . 
  the argument was the population will . 
  in crimea 's case , if anything , the legal argument is much stronger , as crimea used to be russia and was transferred to the ukraine by the ussr , a decision that the russian parliament annulled . . 
  there was a repressive response to the russian protests in the ukraine . 
  the risk was real . 
  that was exactly putin 's argument . 
  fair trade cash is a concept i could embrace though . . 
  i 'm not french but i 'm a left-voter and i find the comparison crimea-kosovo a very fair one . 
  so even cash can be vegan , or not . 
   portugal is amazing for drugs . 
  that column is missing on this ranking . 
  their politicians discussed seriously on banning memes . 
  i rest my case . 
  i understand , this sort of greeting can easily end up in sex transforming an intended interaction of a few seconds into a few hours distraction ... 
  why always dangerous animals ? 
  why not a butterfly or a puppy ? 
  i just wink my left eye and point sensually to the person i 'm greeting . 
  nah , there are quite a few with no animals at all . . 
  nobody believes me when i say that in luxembourg ... but more grey days do n't necessarily mean more water . 
  who said that ? 
  although if by that you mean `` let 's not included in the list of banned websites from this sub '' i have to disagree , as far less poisonous sources have been included in that list . 
  not affected . 
  seriously , let 's not give free advertisement to this . 
  that 's exactly what the media did with trump when he showed up , free attention . . no merit here . 
  and they have a few precedents in spain if i 'm not mistaken , of entire villages winning the lottery and going extinct after that . . there was a documentary about such a case , but ca n't find it now . . edit : [ there 's this one ] ( http://www.gq.com/story/spanish-lottery-winners-sodeto?printable=true ) , but the doc i mean was about an older example , maybe it was in italy , not sure anymore . . 
   i 'm tired of reading about european matters only from anglosphere media . 
  not because it 's universally bad , but because it inevitably reflects a certain set of perspectives , which are hardly ever the ones of the countries it 's talking about . 
  i 'm sure most here will have read an article in anglosphere media talking about internal matters of their own country , which got so many things wrong it was basically useless . 
  nobody puts in question the fact that the uk is a european country , just look to this sub , most links do come from the uk , that 's precisely why it 's a bit silly to list them on a list intended to show that there are more sources beyond the anglosphere ... 
  i have no problems with uk sources , i used them myself on a daily basis . 
  i just do n't think they need any extra promotion ... 
  but the idea is precisely not to be so dependent from uk/us sources ... 
  all europe is incredibly loud when compared to japan, 
  this map was posted before at least 100x, 
  i 'm being sarcastic ... do n't take it literally . 
  anyway that was not my point on my original comment , i 'm just a bit fed up of this website lazily making maps to go viral . . better to use the original sources . 
  lol really not the reason . 
  and that should be accurate , more than other numbers i see there . 
  a portuguese already speaks the 3rd most spoken european language in the world , understands without effort the 2nd most spoken european language in the world and on average we speak 0.6 of the most spoken european language in the world , so why bother with regional dialects spoken only in europe ? 
  an opportunity for trump to widen his anti-journalists vocabulary . 
  oh wait , his wife is slovene , right ? 
  this wo n't get to his hears then ... 
  i 'm a bit fed up of the maps from this source . . they never seem very reliable and the design is also a bit . . hmm . 
  meeh . 
  the former director of ch , killed in the attack , was a communist . 
  there are now many new restaurants giving the sophistication touch to very traditional dishes , if you 're willing to pay the price just follow the michelin guide and you 'll be amazed , 
   others , like britain , have a rule of thumb that judges 10 years is as long as anyone should sensibly hold the top job . 
  i think the queen is there for a bit longer though ... and longer than any president of germany has ever been . 
  which coincidentally is not merkel 's job , she 's the chancellor . 
  what a mess this beginning of the article . 
  if you find it inform half of their youth , they 're also looking for it . 
  i totally agree with this , thank you for your work !, 
  just some quick contributions : germany : http://www.spiegel.de/international/ greece : http://www.ekathimerini.com/ luxembourg : http://www.wort.lu/en portugal : http://www.lusa.pt/default.aspx?page=home&amp;lang=en, 
  ok , fair enough , i see your point . 
   use a credible source forbes magazine is not some random blog ... 
  probably trump 's influence on the referendum is less important than the title implies , but the problem of referendums in general is that they 're rarely about the issue in question and more about punishing the government of the day and so on . 
  these comparisons to trump or brexit help to create a dramatic effect and call voters to the polls , the question is , will these appeal more to the ones inspired by populism or the ones afraid of it ? 
  it 's really tragic though , a once in a life-time opportunity for most italian voters to reform their in-deep-need of reform system and the only thing that matters is to punish the government of the day . 
  this will ensure at least one more lost decade for italy ... it 's amazingly sad how progressive italy used to be , one of the power houses of europe on industry , design , arts , cinema etc , and how stagnated it become ... 
  agreed , cool new name , grew quite a bit , oliven\u00e7a is back and got the canaries . 
  i 'm not offended at all . 
  it 's a great deal . 
  here is [ a eu ranking from the same year ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/competitions/waste-smart-competition/recycling-rates-in-europe/image_view_fullscreen ) with slightly different figures . 
  plus it 's really hard sometimes to find bins on the street in japan , where everything goes mixed ... on the other hand they do produce lots of trash in restaurants , with all the refreshing towels and one-use chop sticks :p, 
  it 's the second time i see this for the past 24hours , why is this trending now ? 
  was weeks ago ... edit : the president also failed to recognize the reporter as french , otherwise he would have replied in french , he loves to speak french ... 
  well then ireland is very much welcomed to join schengen ,
