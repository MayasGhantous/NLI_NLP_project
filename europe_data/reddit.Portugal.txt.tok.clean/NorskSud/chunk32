  do n't think they do , it 's more often used as an insult against crocodile tears by politicians or so ... 
  all very good and fine except for that tiny forgotten detail that : there 's still no brexit !, 
  and `` carpideira '' is a woman paid to cry at funerals . 
  people in the rest of portugal tend to see the azores as a small region , and then get very surprised when they realize that each island has a different accent etc. . this map shows how spread the azorean islands are compared to continental portugal . 
  on top of that there 's a bit of a joke on the postcard that i tried to translate on the title of the post , `` same area , but much more breathable '' . . 
  if someone can find a better translation please go for it , 
  excellent !, 
  thanks , 
  flight connections are also much better within the azores than within continental portugal . 
  an idea for another postcard . . , 
  yeah it 's not ideal in black and white , but the message is powerful . 
  people always forget how spread the azores are ... 
  grows faster than oaks , right ? 
  grows fast enough for the small investor . 
  but agreed , eucalyptus is the main problem . 
  that 's why we 're getting fatter . 
  for many of its uses olive oil is a much better replacement , try that instead  edit : take it back , read replies . 
  run to the glaciers !, 
  it can be in winter time , but ( almost ) no one lives there - most of the population does n't live further than 40km away from the sea . 
  0\u00bac in the main cities is big news . 
  less than +5 \u00bac in lisbon is enough to open the news programs and issue all sorts of warnings . 
  paper industry is the big buyer of eucalyptus wood . 
  so it ends up in toilet paper , literally . 
  that 's a cool idea , but one of the problems of the portuguese forest is that it 's 98 % privately owned and divided in small parcels . 
  the reason portugal burns so much is that private owners invest almost exclusively in fast growing and highly combustible trees , mostly eucalyptus and also pines . 
  only the state could have the time to invest in slower growing but more fire-resistant species such as oak . 
  our current system is doomed to fail and keep on burning , no solution in sight as the private ownership is such a sacred thing in portugal . 
  even the communist party blocked an idea from the current government to make it easier to expropriate abandoned terrains ... 
  it 's due to all the codfish we import from norway . 
  if you want sustainability just go south , brother , 
  it 's not just about beating spain , it 's about being in a completely different category , 
  herz does the same btw ... they offer great fares in exchange of huge compensation for microscopic damages :p, 
  it was actually with them our most recent battle , [ the battle of nuremberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_nuremberg ) . 
  we barely had any wars with germany , was mostly spain and you guys , also holland . 
  trump would only move with `` despacito '' . 
  maybe i was extremely lucky , but that was the temperature the first time i went to finland ... unfortunately trains started to fail due to that and no aircon ... 
  thanks , 
  swiss airlines do n't get the same rules as eu ones ? 
  there is already a easyjet switzerland sa , so i guess they do n't . 
  but is n't morocco also part of the agreement ? 
  i know that ryanair flies from spain or germany to morocco for instance . 
  it 's in the eurovision , you ca n't fly higher than that . 
  at least for now there will be barely any jobs moved to austria over this . 
  [ the portuguese press reported ] ( http://www.dn.pt/dinheiro/interior/portugal-rejeitou-exigencias-e-perde-subsidiaria-da-easyjet-8632905.html ) that one of the demands easyjet made to portugal was to continue to have the british aviation regulator as their ultimate supervisor and portugal rejected this . 
  anything about this issue in austria ? 
  this is not even new ... and passed already many times before here . 
  i thought the link to the post `` spain is lava '' would give you the clue ... 
  you do n't know what sarcasm is ? 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarcasm, 
  oh , the heat also got there ? 
  edit : [ oh yeah , you 're right ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mwmf0/spain_is_lava_again/?st=j52k9oxs&amp;sh=dc74bada ), 
  i wonder if the fact that he was a black tourist was not a more relavant issue to the incident than being an american one . 
  do n't worry , soon we 'll liberate you !, 
  you mean [ estremadura ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/estremadura ) , right ? 
  oh i did n't notice they were even on the map as well ... 
  let 's see . . it 's done . 
  via / u/ze-manel , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mwmf0/spain_is_lava_again/dk55xjf/?st=j527maoz&amp;sh=76e69c9e ) . 
  well ... it was hispania , not spain . 
  then you do n't know how to draw the map of your own country , and no , not every spaniard is that dumb . 
  you should post it with the title `` portugal is lava again ''  edit : ok i 'll do it . 
  and that never happened before !, 
  lol, 
  correction : we were never spain , we shared the king for 60 years , he ruled 2 kingdoms . 
  never spain . 
  well that 's pretty much true and obvious . 
  even a subway ride is expensive in london . 
  plus in our time we really passed the point where more means more when it comes to cities . 
  it 's easier for cities with less than 5 million inhabitants to be pleasant and nice and yet have all the advantages/services/technology of the 10million + . 
  me too , the azores look so cute on the map , right there in the middle of the ocean , 
  could n't this simply be that the app is not as popular with french speakers ( does n't seem very popular in france either ) ? 
  it really is n't just a meme , it 's the reality ... 
  this , i remember the first time i drove kms and kms through the forests in ardennes with incredibly high lampposts all along ... 
  brexit is such a mess ... 
  that 's actually not true , singapore with almost 6 million inhabitants occupies an area ( 719.1 km2 ) which is a fraction of luxembourg ( 2,586.4 km2 ) . 
  that 's really not true though . 
  companies do that , but people do n't . 
  there are n't fake residents , the city and country are indeed booming ... but not with millionaires , normal people coming to work here for a better paycheck . 
  although on a rational level remaining would be the best thing for all parties involved . 
  on the long run i believe that brexiting and eventually returning is the only scenario that respects vote and consequence . 
  remaining now would immediately resuscitate all those silly brexiteers , like ukip etc. . sometimes you do need to taste the poison to believe how bad it really is . 
  so in some countries the app might simply not be popular , right ? 
  i do n't cycle much , but i have to say it has some cool features for runners as well , i especially like the function to find people that crossed with you on your way ... but it 's mostly cyclists :p, 
  and [ andorra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_andorra#nationality ) ... 
  i see a pattern here . 
   making having children less of a financial burden luxembourg already does that very efficiently . 
  the proof ? 
  portuguese residents in luxembourg have 3x the fertility rate of portuguese living in portugal ... ( one of the lowest in the world ) . 
  but this is a fair exception , countries with no regional flags could get a symbolic extra flag . 
  i do n't want luxembourg to lose [ the red lion option ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_luxembourg ) . 
  [ here is a map of luxembourg communes according to the % of foreign residents ] ( https://www.lequotidien.lu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sans-titre.png ) . 
  during the 2010 world cup they even invaded south africa , nobody is at a safe distance . 
   suprisingly large amount are portuguese . 
  during august [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_luxembourger ) 're replaced by [ dutch campers ] ( http://www.lessentiel.lu/fr/luxembourg/story/quels-touristes-choisissent-le-luxembourg--20573715 ) . 
  edit : this is less of a joke than what it looks , the [ luxembourger commune with the highest % of portuguese residents ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/larochette ) is surrounded by camping parks occupied mainly by dutch in the summer months . 
  i 've heard that quite a few portuguese-dutch couples were born out of this ... 
  it was a joke , as in , if the flag ca n't be used on / r/europe everything is pointless . . 
  i ca n't editorialize the title according to this sub rules . 
  anyway the title is correct , spain is occupying a portuguese border town claiming rights by treaty ... even though signed another treaty agreeing to end occupation . 
  they 're still occupying it , so it 's ongoing . 
  that would be cool too .
