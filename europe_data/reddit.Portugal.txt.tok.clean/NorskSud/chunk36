  they 're tiny spots in the moroccan area on display though . 
  but that 's recurrent in spain . 
  imagine sweden doing the same , `` this is the weather in the peninsula today '' and completely obliterating norway ... another example : your national airline is called iberia ( exclusively spanish airline ) . 
  scandinavian airlines is the airline of all scandinavian countries . 
  but whatever , that 's why in portugal the term `` iberian '' is not so liked anyway ... just sounds too spanish . 
  better to keep a safety distance . 
  `` espa\u00f1a peninsular '' would be correct , but that 's not what it says , 
  it 's the atlantic , no sissy mediterranean here ... 
  quite impressive , but most of the population is actually under 30\u00bac on that map . 
  and you call '' [ peninsula ] ( https://www.eltiempo.es/lluvia ) '' to this one ... lol amazing . 
  oh look , a map of greece as well , your eastern neighbors i guess ... 
  oh look , you found space on that map to show the northern tip of morocco . 
  that 's what i call good neighborhood . 
  [ laugh ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/in-queso-emergency.jpg ) every time lol , 
  jesus , saying muslims do n't drink is not an insult/discrimination/islamophobia / whatever ... cool down . 
  obviously if absolute numbers are also going down it means there 's less drinkers now . 
  this could be explained by the shrinking native german population ... eventually also a change of behavior among drinkers , but most likely a generational change , youngsters drinking less than their parents and grandparents . 
  we 're talking about consumption per capita , so obviously if there 's a big migration of non-drinkers the consumption per capita goes down . 
  simple as that . 
  they drive and do n't drink , it 's * tragic * ... 
  funny how few people brought that up . 
  it 's the most obvious and logical explanation . 
  probably pork consumption per capita statistics will show a similar trend . 
   he is ( almost ) always drunk i really do n't think that 's true . 
  he does consume lots of alcohol , but it takes really a lot for him to get drunk . 
  i would be in comma with the quantity he needs to get tipsy ( like when he slapped orban ) . 
  actually when i get eurodepressive that 's my plan b right there . 
  are you saying there are no soy-cows !, 
  freedom of movement of labor is not an absolute freedom . 
  it was always a uk choice to be lax about it . 
  ironically belgium is the country that expels more eu citizens ... 
  i still remember the day a british pm resigned without activating article 50 while the eu leaders were saying they were expecting its activation within hours . 
  they had to wait months , they 're still waiting to start negotiations and in the meanwhile the uk is in a much greater mess than it was 1 year ago ... the eu is ready , it has been for a long time . 
  `` they '' ( non-national european politicians ) have been much less shy on other occasions/referenda . . but with uk everybody thought would turn bad if they did anything . 
  i guess we 'll never know , but my guess is that it could have been a positive thing . 
  after all this was not a british internal issue , this was as an european affair as it can get . 
  they were not loud nor clear enough . 
  the press is also at fault of course , the bbc , guardian etc should have also take a much stronger role debunking lies , that 's what good unbiased journalism does anyway ... 
  finally the european politicians are also at fault . 
  everybody was so afraid that any interference would be counterproductive that they simply did not intervene in the campaign . 
  and i think a human european touch really missed there . . yeah , some people would be very pissed off if they saw a german politician campaigning for remain , but others would feel reassured . 
  i 'm more and more convinced that it was the ignorance on the remain side that lead to this result . 
  that were obvious leave lies that should have been taken down immediately but the remain apparently did n't know they were lies . 
  it 's not surprising that the british people know so little about the eu , but that it 's political class seems not to know much more is truly shocking . 
  what they 're calling a `` soft brexit '' it 's just symbolically being out of the eu ( no need for flags , yey ! ), 
  while in practice being much more connected and dependent than they were before . 
  just like norway or switzerland ... forced to pay , forced to accept eu legislation without voting on it , forced to schengen ... 
  but would it only be needed for the uk to withdraw the leaving request or the other 27 would have to agree on it ? 
  and now people in the uk will learn about the many exceptions that were conceded just to the uk ... among them not being part of schengen , something that even efta countries are forced to join . 
  yes , you actually had control over your borders ... if they were not undercontrol was not due to the eu ... 
  on the other hand it worries me a bit that everyone is becoming english-speaking , english is influencing tremendously how we speak and even write in our native languages ... and most these changes are not so positive nor consequential ... but at the same time how can we argue that some children should n't learn it ? 
  it really is important to learn it . . 
  saw a guy that walked down with his old aunt from the 17th . 
  so definetely those signs indicating for people to stay in their apartments killed lots of people . 
  if that guy managed to evacuate from the 17th it means most people would have managed as well , were there indications and alarms ... 
  i guess that now that his political survival is gone , he 's finally putting his country first . 
  better late than never . 
  but would even be better if may did the same , country first , political survival second . 
  [ here you can see the complete table of possibilities/impossibilities ] ( http://canadiancrc.com/paternity_determination_blood_type.aspx ) , 
  if you have an impossible blood type , for instance , both your parents are o and you are ab , that 's not possible , you ca n't be biological their son/daughter . 
  on the other hand if someone kills someone in europe while shouting `` alahu alakbar '' we 're immediately presented with reports about islamophobia ... 
  i think it 's pretty much concentrated on one brand , \u00d3rbita - they 're very big . 
  i think they could n't vote for the referendum though . . but not sure . 
  reason : cause we are the only continent that does n't have one . 
  it 's your chance . 
  i see quite some small damages on buildings , tiles that fell and so . 
  hope you guys are fine though . 
  there 's silly people in all countries , but fortunately they rarely win elections/referenda ... 
  yes , in this case the `` fake luxembourg '' is the belgian province . 
  i think that the olivier that made it popular in russia was actually a belgian chef . 
  this reminds me those interviews with brits living along the spanish coast saying they were in favor of brexit because of all the foreigners in the uk and that was one of the reasons they moved to spain ... there 's no face-palm big enough . 
  luxembourg has a border with the province of luxembourg ( belgium ) and all is nice and peaceful ... 
  this does sound petty . 
  in some countries a macedonia is a russian salad , known in russia as olivier salad ... i would go somewhere along these lines to avoid a branding waste . 
  russian salad republic or olivier republic for example . 
  he does n't have the numbers . . this is just rhetoric to push for new elections soon . . 
  turn on your tv , he is in porto right now . 
  and this is the part where people forget the lyrics ... 
  yep , but i mean the official parade with the president , 
  that 's a national classic anyway , some years ago during some football cup a supermarket chain was selling very cheap flags that just had a little issue , the castles of the flag looked like chinese temples ahahah edit : the same [ issue happened in brussels with a more expensive looking flag as well ] ( http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/mundo/2013-02-07-substituida-bandeira-de-portugal-com-pagodes-chineses-em-bruxelas ) . 
   usually there is a military show in lisbon already for quite some years that the celebrations go to different cities , and since marcelo is president the idea is to alternate a portuguese city and a foreign one with many portuguese residents . 
  last year was in paris , this year is in porto and next year will be in s\u00e3o paulo . 
  edit : actually they 're going to s\u00e3o paulo today , so the celebration is in both locations this year , porto and s\u00e3o paulo + rio de janeiro . 
  because it would n't be portuguese enough to pick someone 's birthrate , a death in misery and desperation is what really represents us , 
   hard brexit mandate is n't there anymore . 
  but is n't there an automatic hard brexit in less than 2 years if nothing else is negotiated with success ? 
  no chance of them not abstaining in order to make it easier for this dup fall ? 
  i love the series btw , by far the best ever humor series made in portugal . 
  but i 'm quite sure that russia has imported series before and to bigger markets than ours . . but most of the times remakes are not really presented like that , so the viewers do n't even realize it . . 
  i love [ familie braun ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5460924/ ) , although that 's more of a webseries than a tv series ... 
  that 's what i read on the portuguese press , that the portuguese channel bought the format from russia . 
  edit : that 's also what says on imdb :  sim , chef !, 
  ( 2017 ) ( tv series )  portuguese remake of a russian original edit 2 : i took a look on the [ 1st episode of the russian original on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpezutp0xe8 ) and it 's almost frame by frame the same as with [ the portuguese version ] ( https://www.rtp.pt/play/p3020/e267045/sim-chef ) . 
  just the casting looks very different , i think the original version had a stronger bet on sex appeal ahaha . 
  that one got a [ portuguese remake ] ( http://media.rtp.pt/ministeriodotempo/ ) , but i never become a fan to be honest . . 
  * best portuguese crime series : [ `` a filha da lei '' ] ( http://media.rtp.pt/filhadalei/ ) - this is really good , deserves to be exported . 
  * best portuguese humor series ( not original though , the original is [ russian ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2930610/?ref_=tt_trv_cnn ) !, 
  '' ] ( http://media.rtp.pt/simchef/ ) - very funny moments , the format is great , deserves remakes around europe . 
  * best historical series ( portuguese-galician coproduction ) : [ `` vidago '' ] ( https://www.rtp.pt/play/p3354/vidago-palace ) - quite nice series about the times of spanish civil war and the trafficking across the border , the set is a luxury spa hotel in northern portugal . 
  * not really that good , but quite original in its format , a portuguese-angolan romantic-sitcom about aviation staff flying mostly between lisbon and luanda : [ `` voo directo - a vida a 900 \u00e0 hora '' ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/programa/tv/p26527 ) you can watch them all for free online , enjoy !,
