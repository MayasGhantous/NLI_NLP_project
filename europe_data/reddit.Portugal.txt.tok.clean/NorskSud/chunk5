  were they also shouting `` mighty jesus '' while killing their victims ? 
  so there goes the theory that if the uk leaves it will be a domino effect in northern europe ... they just want the leftovers . 
  is not like the western media went hysterical - as they normally would be - with the decapitations by `` mentally disturbed people '' of muslim faith when it happened in the west : * [ palmira silva beheaded in london 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_palmira_silva ) * [ herv\u00e9 cornara , france 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-quentin-fallavier_attack ) * [ colleen hufford , oklahoma , us 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaughan_foods_beheading_incident ) also do n't expect anyone making the link between these incidents as that would obviously be `` islamophobic '' and therefore totally racist for some reason not connected to race . . but whatever . 
  lol, 
  lol there 's not just 2 possibilities , mediterranean is not a synonym of southern ( or the opposite of nordic ) , that 's what i tried to explain all along . 
  portugal is a southern european country . 
  southwestern to be precise . 
  nothing wrong about being mediterranean . 
  we simply are not . 
  portuguese cuisine is immensely influenced by its former trade routes . 
  2 examples , portugal is by far the number one european country in rice consumption per capita . 
  it 's also by far the n\u00ba1 european country in fish consumption per capita , atlantic fish that is . 
  the `` mediterranean born religion '' is the same as for instance belgium or ireland have . 
  anyway , all christianity is originally from israel . . so ? 
  the language is of roman origin . 
  saying mediterranean origin says nothing about the language , as several very different language groups formed around the mediterranean sea . 
  now , of course we have several things in common with some mediterranean countries , and fortunately much less with others ( syria , lybia ... ) . 
  one of the things we definitely do not have in common with those countries is a mediterranean coast , our coast is 100 % atlantic . 
  btw the vice-pm is also gay  it 's a little gay mecca here , be warned refugees !, 
  lol you wo n't give up . 
  do you know [ who else has a mediterranean climate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate ) ? 
  southern california and many parts of australia ... oh well , it 's not about the climate , it 's about the sea , the sea unknown to portugal :p, 
  certainly , but again , portugal does not have a mediterranean coast , it 's as simple as that . 
  is andorra a mediterranean country ? 
  what about serbia ? 
  or macedonia or kosovo ? 
  maybe they are according to some characteristics , but none has a mediterranean coast as well . 
  the key part is right at the top of that page :  located in the north atlantic ocean, 
  we 're also not loud , that 's all on the spanish side of the border . 
  `` mediterranean '' culture is a very wide concept , it would include syria or algeria or israel ... `` southern european '' is a more accurate designation . 
  even if morocco is closer geographically , ireland is much closer culturally or in the mindset for example . 
  let 's see for instance the same-sex marriage map of europe , [ it 's an atlantic thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage#/media/file:same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg ) . 
  iceland used to have more trees before it was colonized , [ but they 're planting new ones now ] ( http://www.skogur.is/english/forestry-in-a-treeless-land/ ) . 
  it just feels weird to most portuguese to be called mediterranean when we do n't know that sea . . we just deal with the real ocean  plus let 's not forget insular portugal , all deep in the atlantic . 
  also only the southern half of continental portugal gets a mediterranean climate . . 
  luxembourg has wet dreams with the banks moving from the city to the duchy . 
  well a few did it already . 
  is it just my impression or they `` whitened '' [ ant\u00f3nio costa ] ( http://www.orossio.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/costa.jpg ) ? 
  once again farmers refuse competition in europe and successfully block and destroy produce from other european farmers ... this became routine across some borders . . 
  summary : 30.000 liters of milk were destroyed today in a protest of galician ( northwestern spain ) producers against portuguese milk , which they regard as unfair competition . 
  the local galician government has been increasing the controls on portuguese milk trucks , last year 109 such controls were made , this year is already counting 95 . 
  the sanctions to russia and slow chinese growth are pointed as factors to the current low price of milk in europe at the origin of these protests . 
   fair distribution . 
  an example , portugal is actually welcoming refugees , or better said , welcoming the idea . 
  but so far portugal received only 26 of the predicted 2500 from the distribution mechanism , how come ? 
  besides hard to understand burocracy , just last week portugal was expecting 10 more refugees from greece , but then greece sent a message : `` sorry guys , we lost them since we told them they were going to portugal '' . 
  i think these numbers show very well what 's at play here . 
  that poland does n't want to receive refugees is secondary to the primary factor that no refugees want to go to poland , nor hungary , nor portugal . 
  refugees are coming with a very selected country list on their minds : germany , sweden , finland , netherlands , and sometimes for family reasons some others like belgium , france . . 
  not really , it 's calm waters there mostly . . more than 99 % of crossings are successful , tragedies are the exception . 
  ahaha that 's epic !, 
  lol , 
  i guess for the same reasons there is a 500 $ or a 1000 chfr . 
  so you must live in a country not visited by troika . 
  you can also use anonymous plastic money buy the way , they 're called prepaid cards . 
  the state can see what 's on your bank account , your neighbor ca n't . 
  being transparent to the state is not equal to being public . 
  not only , [ the latvians had a note worth more than 700 $ prior to the $ uro !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_lats ), 
  what about the 200 $ ? 
  there 's also quite some issues with france . . but hell , who does n't have issues with france , right ? 
  there 's not even one ikea shop in luxembourg . 
  the shop that serves the duchy is right on the border on the belgian side ( lower salaries ) , [ first thing you see once you cross the border ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/place/ikea+arlon/@49.6400309,5.8849399,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47eab3e746faac1f:0x57e66535022dc3ec?hl=pt-pt ) . 
   because i see people talking about him like he is completly innocent or something . 
  it does seem like he is completely innocent , innocent people can be wrongly accused by witnesses too - and not always innocent mistakes . 
   despite the new findings , van der dussen spent nine more years in jail because of the snail-paced spanish justice system oh dear, 
  non-elected eurogroup feeds panic mode of markets against democratically elected government of portugal . 
  eurocrats do n't learn , that 's why the ship is sinking and no one notices it . 
  having something like a tv channels ( well if anybody was watching tv ) where they can report on things like what the eu is doing and also introduce the various eu countries more to each other . 
  increase transparency on what the eu is doing , encourage people to know and care about it and get involved . 
  there is already , it 's called euronews , transmits in multiple languages and no one cares about it . 
  personally that would work for me . 
  i dislike when atms only have 50s . 
  stuff costing more than 30 $ i always pay with plastic . 
  last year a colombian woman arriving at bogot\u00e1 airport was found to have swallowed 64 latex-covered capsules , each containing five $ 100 bills . 
  at heathrow two years ago , a smuggler trying to fly out to meet an isis sympathiser in turkey was caught with 40 $ 500 notes in her underwear . 
  neither crime would have been possible -- on such a scale , at least -- if high-denomination notes were taken out of circulation . 
  and that is the simple goal of a group of academics and financial-crime experts , convinced that such notes -- the $ 500 note , the $ 100 bill , the sfr1 ,000 note and the # 50 note -- have made it too easy for mobsters , tax cheats and terrorists to move large sums without detection . 
  getting rid of the notes would be easy and legitimate business would barely notice , says peter sands , the former standard chartered chief executive who has published a paper on the topic from his new position at harvard kennedy school . 
  `` it 's not often that you come across a policy proposal that is simultaneously easy-to-implement , has a powerful positive impact , and very limited downside , '' he says . 
  countries have taken high-value notes out of commission in the recent past . 
  canada scrapped a c$ 1,000 note in 2000 , while singapore did the same for a s$ 10,000 note two years ago . 
  but forging an international consensus to do away with the most widely used high-value bills -- the $ 100 and $ 500 notes -- may not be easy . 
  germany , for example , is still very fond of cash in all its guises , and views attempts to limit the free circulation of notes with suspicion . 
  last year carl-ludwig thiele , an executive board member at the bundesbank , gave a presentation to the bank for international settlements in which he spelt out the enduring appeal of cash , and warned that any attempt by banks to impose negative interest rates on ordinary depositors would result in them hoarding more of it . 
  `` the bundesbank rejects any calls for restrictions on cash holdings , which have been voiced by some in light of this situation , '' he said . 
  some governments may also fear the loss of seignorage , or the income generated by central banks from issuing interest-free currency , minus the cost of production . 
  if the total value of cash outstanding were to fall after cutting out high-denomination notes , then so too would that income . 
  rob wainwright , director of europol , the european police organisation , notes that the central bank of luxembourg is a particularly prolific producer of high-denomination notes , even though surveys show the country to be among the most cash-averse in europe , along with france and the netherlands . 
  according to a europol report published last july , luxembourg issued notes equivalent to 194 per cent of its gross domestic product in 2013 , compared with 16 per cent in germany , 9 per cent in italy and 4 per cent in france . 
  the anomaly is `` quite striking , '' says mr wainwright . 
  the $ 500 note accounts for about 30 per cent of the value of all notes in circulation in the eurozone , adds mr wainwright , `` but they 're hardly ever used or seen by people in business . 
  the evidence we have certainly links to criminal activity . '' a chinese policeman shows off cash and other seized items after a crackdown on a taiwanese money laundering syndicate , during a press conference in beijing on march 26 , 2009 . 
  experts fear the export-dependent chinese economy slowing to 6.8 percent growth in the final quarter of 2008 , and rising unemployment figures could cause a crime wave as china 's 1.3 billion people struggle with the consequences of the global meltdown . 
  china out getty out afp photo / afp / afp \u00a9 afp cash is seen as stock in trade for criminals mr wainwright appears to have an ally in mario draghi , the governor of the european central bank and former governor of the bank of italy , which produced a study in 2009 showing how high-value bills were the stock-in-trade of the mafia . 
  last week , in response to an european commission announcement that it would investigate the role of the $ 500 note in terrorism finance , mr draghi said that the ecb wanted to make `` orderly '' changes , and was `` determined not to make seignorage a comfort for criminals '' . 
  david lewis , paris-based executive secretary of the financial action task force , an inter-governmental body set up 27 years ago to combat money-laundering , notes that the timing of mr sands ' campaign is good , in the wake of the recent terror attacks in france and the migration crisis across europe . 
  he says that `` a large portion '' of cash smuggled across borders comes from people trafficking -- not far behind drugs trafficking and tax fraud . 
  mr sands says he hopes that the matter can get on the agenda of the next g20 summit in hangzhou in china . 
  until then , says mr lewis , the best thing the fatf can do is to `` ensure attention to the criminal use of these notes , and ask countries to think again if it 's appropriate to issue them '' .
