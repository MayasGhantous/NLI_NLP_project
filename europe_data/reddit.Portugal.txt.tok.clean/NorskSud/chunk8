  and deficit went down this year anyway . 
  the idea was to have something northern sounding for north mixed with something southern sounding for south . 
  but this was not a very thought-through process . . was just the 2 minutes needed to register here , 
  i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but i think was just what was allowed after several attempts of having northsouth as a nick name trying several linguistic variations ... 
  i 'm from northern portugal , a southern country , and live in the south of luxembourg , northern enough by portuguese standards . 
  so i chose norsk not in the `` norwegian '' sense but in the older northern sense ... hope i did n't get the etymology wrong :p, 
  that 's quite rich of you . 
  worth adding that for instance in portugal the criminalization also came with the republic . 
  before that it was not on the penal code . 
  it 's the republic and eventually the dictatorship that make the laws tougher against gays . 
  brilliant summary , 
   it would be interesting to see the same numbers for those aged 18-35 or so yeah , portugal would have a big jump on this numbers . 
  my parents generation was all about french - if you did study a foreign language at high-school . 
  but these days kids start frequently at kindergarten with english songs and so . 
  but that 's about proficiency among english students of different countries . 
  not proficiency in the general population . 
  that 's it !, 
   will the problem go away if we do n't look at it ? 
  when the problem it 's speculation it helps not to talk about it . 
  just look at all the effort to stop talking about deutsche bank . 
  are you really that naive ? 
  we 've seen case after case during the last case of not so good economic situations turned into hell due to speculation . 
  go on and trust this stupid , uninformative and once again prejudiced article by spiegel . 
  about this case specifically , why was it not brought up at the time portugal left the aid-program ? 
  that was already the situation then , plus a right-win gov. 
  in the meanwhile gov changed , economical indicators improved and suddenly spiegle questions the rating ? 
  if anything it would have been much more questionable 1 or 2 years ago . 
  this article comes out of the blue , with a political agenda behind it . 
  paul magnette is hot . 
  this article is full of bs . 
  the `` tiny agency '' is the 4th worldwide . 
  portuguese growth increased , deficit decreased . 
  right now there would be no economic reasons to lower the rating as the situation has in fact been improving . 
  the reasons to lower the rating could only be political , bs articles such as this are a push for that political move . 
  thought spiegel had higher standards , but somehow whenever the subject is portugal this magazine is all about prejudices and zero facts . 
  tiny ?!, 
   dbrs is the fourth largest ratings agency in the world , with about a 2.5 % global market share . 
  years negotiating the deal , but had to be approved within weeks with as little public discussion as possible . 
  considering the miserable canadian record on environment policy i 'm relieved this did n't pass . 
  we 'll fat-tax it anyway ... so what 's the catch ? 
  and why a trate agreement discussed during years behind closed doors must be approved as fast as possible without public discussion ? 
  oh so no more trade with canada ? 
  oh wait , we do have trade , there 's even maple syrup in the european supermarkets ... so what 's the catch ? 
  [ apparently not ] ( http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty ) . 
  to be honest i had the impression that angola had a majority of native speakers , but then i googled and found that number in reference to a study from 2012 . 
  a [ more recent study mentions 71.5 % of angolans use portuguese at home ] ( http://observalinguaportuguesa.org/angola-portugues-e-falado-por-7115-de-angolanos/ ) , so maybe the 40 % are the strictly monolingual ones . 
  anyway , i do n't know any comparable example for french . 
  in fact several countries have english and french as official languages or french and arabic . 
  that 's why i say those projections for french in africa seem highly exaggerated . 
  by the way , seems also to be transgender in spanish : [ `` en cuanto al g\u00e9nero , puede considerarse ambiguo ( el brexit/la brexit ) , aunque el uso mayoritario es el masculino . 
  funny , do n't get it why the portuguese newspapers made it masculine . 
  the brazilian ones use `` a brexit '' which seems much more logic to me , as it 's an exit or `` uma sa\u00edda '' , therefor feminine . 
  but you find exceptions on both sides of the atlantic , so i think it 's still an ongoing discussion . 
  i would say it 's transgender right now in portuguese . 
   it comes to manifestations or football . 
  but even there , we do n't really have hooligans or a hooliganism problem . 
  i do n't know the origin of these expressions but would n't be surprised if they were propaganda from the fascist times ... people tend to behave as the stereotypes/ideas of normalcy expect , so that was a powerful anti-revolutionary idea . 
  of course history shows that there were dozens of revolutions and even civil wars , so . . it 's probably wishful thinking from dictatorial times . 
  other sayings , not really expressions but things you hear a lot , is that it 's a `` country of poets '' and that `` portuguese are citizens of the world '' . 
   the study 's methodology is somewhat questionable , since it counts as french-speakers all the inhabitants of countries where french is an official language i wonder if there is any african country that is genuinely a francophone country , that is , a country where the majority of its inhabitants are native speakers of french . 
  in the case of portuguese , which has the oldest colonization history in africa , that 's not even true for angola , where around 40 % are native speakers . 
  plus in the case of french several countries have it as one of 2 or more official languages . 
  `` jardim \u00e0 beira-mar plantado '' - `` garden planted by the sea . '', 
  `` o povo \u00e9 sereno '' / `` pa\u00eds de brandos costumes '' - the people is calm . 
  / country of mild habits . 
  oh gosh , do we have to call it `` bresortie '' now ?

  let 's make it a #shareamovietrailerfromyourcountryfriday, 
  anyway i do n't care , it was just a joke , and it lasted the 24hours of the 100th day-versery , so it 's fine ... 
  besides being a repetition : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/491xue/what_are_some_recent_or_in_production_upscale/?st=iujjt5iw&amp;sh=7812560d what 's the political aspect of a football match ? 
  you mean like this one ? 
  sorry about it , next time i 'll post some mexican recipe instead . . 
  are those links nsfw ? 
  the total decay of europe ... and still , always on top of all well-being rankings , freedom of press , etc. 
  the most wanted migration destination etc etc etc but reading some press one wonders why there are n't queues of european refugees trying to run away from the continent . 
  and they should totally have wan this year ... brilliant song . 
  it kind of was . 
  well , rich women could do whatever they wanted , probably was fashionable among certain elites . 
  but to most women was something not well seen . 
  portugal was very catholic and conservative 40 years ago . 
  fortunately times change . 
  following that logic the banning inter-racial marriages could be very democratic if people voted for it , right ? 
  of course the opinion of people matter , that 's why we have elections and so on . . we do n't need a referendum on people 's opinion on a few people 's marriage right to access opinion . 
  the simple fact that this issue is very particular and does not affect most people should be enough to keep it away from a referendum . 
  makes no sense to do it . 
  by comparison makes much more sense to make a referendum on the budget , speed limits or gun rights . 
  now that i think about it i know at least one , sissi . 
  and incidentally she is known in portugal for having lived in madeira due to breathing problems ... so this thing of austrian women being heavy smokers could backtrack to her . 
  oh , there , i found my clich\u00e9 !, 
  austrian women are heavy smokers , 
  i think it 's a youtube directive about copyright , the eu is clean on this . 
  because democracy is not just about voting , it 's about equal rights , about respect and freedom . 
  voting a law does not necessarily make it more democratic than discussing it in parliament or approve it in a cabinet meeting . 
  i was going to answer , but then i realized i have zero clich\u00e9s / stereotypes about austrian women :(, 
  i think more young women smoke than young men , but still , less young people smoke than old people . 
  i think there was a transition moment where most men saw zero `` emancipation '' about smoking , and just waste of money and health , while for women there was still an `` emancipation appeal '' . 
  40 years ago women smoking were total rebels . . hopefully it 's dying away for both genders . . 
  why make up an entirely new law when it 's much easier to make a tiny update on the current one ? 
  why is it so troubling to allow gays to marry ? 
  is n't this a bit generational ?
