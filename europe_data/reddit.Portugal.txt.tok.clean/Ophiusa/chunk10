  i am also not thrilled than people look at a blue cross on silver field and associate it with finland , especially considering that we ( presumably ) had that design in the 12th century and finland adopted it in the 20th century , but there is no law against it and that 's that . 
  i suppose . 
  white and blue have been the colours of portugal for close to a thousand years now - although a simple cross on silver field only began to be described as the first flag in the 16th century . 
  as you rightly point out though the cross in symmetric in our case , and the blue is different . 
  ideally the coat-of-arms would be present in the middle ( a shield which still has a blue cross arragement on silver field to this day ) ,, 
  there are three different trends ( at least ) of `` extreme-right '' . 
  all of them have french and european equivalents . 
  mind you , i am more of a libe or l'humanit\u00e9 reader so take what i write with a pinch of salt , but in all honestly i think i 'm quite unbiased in my descriptions : ** 1 ) integralism : ** the one related to your example , they derive from the 19th century reaction against the french revolution , solidified in the 20th century in movements such as maurras ' * action francaise * . 
  ultramontanist , in favour of an absolute monarchy , morally conservative to the extreme ( basically co-opting the most traditionalist movements inside the church , think sspx and the like ) , economically more varied but typically corporatist . 
  today this movement does not have a well-known political group ( several minuscule ones here and there ) but the fringes of the monarchist party and cds ( right-wing `` christian democratic '' party ) contain some representatives , mainly intellectuals . 
  some of them would hardly be considered `` extreme right-wing '' though , some of those inside these movement are very right-wing in some topics but not in others . 
  [ this royalist page ] ( http://realfamiliaportuguesa.blogspot.pt/2013/12/integralismo-lusitano-100-anos-depois.html ) displays some typical iconography , even without reading you will get the idea just by looking at the photos . 
  ** 2 ) fascism : ** a word which could be debated since the exact defintion of fascism and how and when it applied to the `` estado novo '' dictatorship of salazar is debated . 
  still , this represents broadly those who support the pre-revolution of 1974 portugal : colonial rule , world empire , anti-communism , anti-eu . 
  generally not monarchists but favouring a `` republic of a strong leader '' . 
  economically it has a lot of variance , some corporatists and protectionists , others more liberal , in general all agree in the subordination of the economy to the interests of the nation ( in portugal it is never `` the state '' , always `` the nation '' ) . 
  i 'm including `` orthodox fascists '' here as well although they ended up being marginalised by salazar 's regime and partially integrated to the token creation of a corporate chamber . 
  today these orbit around the right-wing of cds and the `` traditionalist '' part of pnr ( see below ) , and i would n't be surprised if some deputies in the assembly right now fall broadly in this group ( at least in some way ) . 
  while they do not seem to have an active or popular party you can have a glimpse in this [ daily newspaper ] ( http://jornaldiabo.com/ ) : one article about an incident of the colonial war in africa and how it proves the betrayal of the revolution to portuguese of every colour , another article about how the 1974 revolution literally ended the dream of king john ii ( 15th century ) , another on the renaissance of european culture . 
  ** 3 ) racist : ** a bit different than the ones before , although many ( but not all ) of the ones above can also adopt this discourse . 
  here i 'm talking about * blut und boden * nationalists to which ethnicity plays an essential part ... even this is quite varied , think guillaume faye and grece and all the * nouvelle droite * , but also the ( more ordinary and ready for the proles , as it were ) us-based efforts like stormfront , hammerskins , etc , etc. 
  depending on the intellectual level this includes street-level skinheads who kick african immigrants to death to those with well-thought plans on how to avoid `` invasion by immigration '' and how this is needed for the sake of all and not because of racism . 
  they all get bundled together so i 'm doing the same here , and these tend to vote [ pnr - national renovation party ] ( http://www.pnr.pt/ ) , you can see the anti-islam banner there and how this is an import from similar movements in europe . 
  this would be the most clearly anti-immigration party , with public rallies which include skinheads , trips to germany to join npd rallies concerning dresden , etc. 
  it does , however , contain the `` traditionalist '' component i mentioned in the previous point as well , which causes some friction . 
  an important point to make is that just like every other european country which had a pluri-continental overseas empire there is some important differences that , as i said , can make the different groups fight each other : the more racist ones defend an `` europe of nations '' and are strongly against any kind of immigration from africa or south america , whereas the `` imperialist '' ones tend to have this idea of `` portuguese of many colours '' ( just like the french , `` trois couleurs , une drapeau , une empire '' and the like ) even if they are generally against massive presence of `` colonials '' in the `` rectangle '' - and the integralists , well , they are thorn between the catholic universalist view and the dislike for foreigners and the repulsion of miscegenation . 
  edit : one important point is that ** they are not all idiots , imbeciles , ignorant and brutes ** , the left has this tendency to associate everyone else with anti-intellectualism which is partially true in some of the cases but completely wrong in others : many of them have solid theoretical foundations , it 's not just a whim out of disliking foreigners . 
  not very original , but * the brothers karamazov * by dostoyevsky would be an immediate choice . 
  most of them are illegal though and none of them are portuguese names , just names that some which speak portuguese use - a good comparison are `` ebonics '' names in the us , they follow similar , er , rules . 
  not sure why you were down voted , that is correct . 
  for a while i thought it was unwillingness but in reality it is a real inability made possible by the drastic different complexity of vowel sounds in both languages . 
  that would work , but consider that galician has been `` normalised '' in galicia in a way to make it closer to castilian and those who are bilingual , in vocabulary and in spelling . 
  there is some debate in galicia about it to this day which i will not detail but which has some political implications . 
  that said , portuguese was from the beginning galician with an army , an empire and status as a language of culture , something that unfortunately stopped being true north of the border . 
  the very debate about they being two different languages or dialects of a common language is marred by political implications , made worse by the way we both perceive each other ( also a result of historical processes , some as recent as franco 's policy , others from galician immigration in lisbon in the xix century , others older and from the border skirmishes in the xv century which were perhaps the main driver behind mutual suspicion due the the impact they had in populations near the border ) . 
  otoh there is support in the academic world for galiza to join the lusophone commonwealth and most people i know recognise the shared linguistic ties . 
  from what i 've understood this post concerns those circle jerking subreddits that deal with stereotyped nationalism . 
  since spain is the only country we have a border with it 's an obvious choice . 
  not that i 'm a fan of these things tbh . 
  in actual daily life kids do n't even learn about spain since portugal is shown as an isolated rectangle with islands , which is actually bad in a different way . 
  this as changed a bit with all the eu derived parts of the curriculum though . 
  ahh yes , absolutely agreed !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw-m0kocfas ) does indeed conjure warm feelings , i was a kid during the 80s so everytime the eurovision segment played it reminded me of having a window to something bigger - no internet at the time . 
  i suppose i am not immune to some sentimental attachment after all , thanks for that . 
  jesus mate , that was hearthfelt , thanks for sharing . 
  i remember some months ago cameron was snubbed/ignored when addressing those very issues . 
  i remember the media portraying it as a `` britain wanted more exceptions , told to shut up '' . 
  i also remember thinking to myself , even if i 'm more of a morning star than daily telegraph reader , that this would be the sort of treatment that would only increase the contempt for the eu in some sectors of british society . 
  in a way the more the eu rejects any talk about immigration control , cap and whatnot , the more it fuels resentment ( justified or not ) in the uk ( and in england in particular ) . 
  another invasion attempt foiled !, 
  anyone knows the reaction of the army for national liberation ? 
  you are sidestepping part of the modern ideological underpinnings of nazism and in particular how it is applied in countries from the former soviet block . 
  this is the third time i mention this topic without great success , and even so i have somewhat restrained myself considering the amount of topics in / r/europe that deal with it . 
  many in the `` nationalist '' , extreme-right-wing camp in those countries already did the job of rationalising away what you mention . 
  since they also have an ethnic component to their discourse it is obvious that the * untermensch * perspective is hardly something flattering , so they have adapted it in many ways : one of the most popular is to downplay it and go with `` well , hitler said it but did n't really meant it , it was just for the bantz ! '' . 
  this is easily seen in otherwise neutral comments that at some point add '' ... oh , and hitler did n't really meant that , he actually thought of [ insert whichever eastern european nationality here ] very highly , he actually kidnapped their kids since they were actually see as ideal nordics lol '' - not only doing away with the traditional nazi perspective on the worth of slavs as a race , but hinting towards a certain superiority just in case . 
  this is not actually completely new : the ss * did * have a sort of internationalist component to it , composed as it was of divisions from different european countries `` united against bolshevism '' . 
  this actually worked in many countries ( and [ here is an example ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-snzuww96ywg/utc0qemnlli/aaaaaaaadcc/-yxplqra0ks/s1600/nova+imagem+%2818%29.jpg ) , to use something closer to home ) , and more so towards the end of the war in europe and the need to gain all support possible . 
  in eastern europe the plan to exterminate them all was tactically put on hold in order to make use of the volunteers from those countries ( which were amongst the ones with a worse track record in terms of war crimes in the eastern front ) . 
  fast forward half a century , add some stormfront-ish revisionism and you get a perspective in which nazi germany was a civilisational force against the mongols , and former ss volunteers of those countries freedom-fighters who had the misfortune of ending up in the defeated side , abandoned by a western europe sold to communism , etc , etc. 
  the countries which ( re ) emerged after the fall of the eastern block go back to the war period and `` reclaim '' their former `` heros '' , which were considered war criminals before but that just confirms that they must have been freedom fighters . 
  this has a way to work hand-in-hand with the eu vs. russia feud , replacing the junkers with modern-day neo-liberalism and adding a veneer of religious zeal to build an image which is the antithesis of what was idealised under communism . 
  while much of what i describe is restricted to the more militant and extreme groups , some parts of it echoes throughout the national discourse of the rest of society , in different ways and intensities , and a relatively common version of it can be read in all these threads here and there . 
  honest question here , does anyone feel a strong attachment to eu symbols ( day , flag , anthem , whatever ) ? 
  i 'm not particularly euro skeptic but i simply do not get any strong emotions , no slight shiver down my spine or anything like that ... perhaps this partially explains the difficulty of further federalisation . 
  unemployment increased , labour laws changed to decrease worker 's rights , a good percentage of those who work do so in minimum wage jobs or non-remunerated professional internships which go on for years , many others never have a contract work by what we call `` green slip '' , wages cut back and pensions withheld . 
  depending on who you ask though the above is either a proof of utter failure or enormous success . 
  i agree with you in general , my comment was partially tongue-in-cheek but mainly because i am personally at odds with the kind of discourse which tends to focus on foreign investment . 
  what 's more i admit that i dislike the level of angolan investment ( and chinese for that matter ) , but in this topic i 'm trying to keep that a bit segregated ... 
  i think that part of this is without a doubt a perception issue , a sort of post-colonial trauma of having companies bought by a former colony . 
  as you so well mentioned in another thread this is hardly unique or specific to portugal , but here we are . 
  to your comment i would just add two remarks : while i have little doubts that angola is a cleptocracy and everyone investing here is directly linked with the angolan government , i do not see a huge difference from , say , the uae or saudi arabia , which beneath their plexiglass towers in the middle of the desert have a practice of indentured servitude , nepotism and lack of rule of law . 
  furthermore , several countries in europe have made quite a good living specialising in lack of regulatory scrutiny for all those investing there , with huge banking sectors which in practice thrive on ill gotten gains . 
  additionally i would note that even if the specific economic conditions are essential to attract investment there is also something to be said about familiarity : most of the angolan elite either studied in portugal or has their children studying in portugal , their intellectual elite ( even the one who fought for independence ) was overwhelmingly educated in portugal and as such portugal retains a specific place in their world-view , even for those who otherwise think little of the country . 
  i 'm not saying this is the only or even major reason , but given that portuguese companies were always present in angola it 's not surprising that their network includes a lot of people with companies here , which in turn facilitates investment . 
  is n't foreign investment all the rage ? 
  why is this so strange then , does n't it mean that a dynamic and growing economy is finding portugal a great place to invest , like the saudis or the americans have done all over europe ? 
  or the concern is that this could jeopardize the chinese investment ? 
  perhaps there was an expectation from our european partners concerning first dibs at looting ? 
  i mean , this could just as well be painted as great news , the result of the strengthening economic ties within the lusosphere , i 'm sure that i 've read similar perspectives when other european countries have ex-colonies buying up their companies . 
  stop trying to one - up us , it was clearly stolen from our pm `` highest immigration numbers since the 70s are clearly a sign of enterpreneuring spirit and they do well in leaving since the world is their oyster '' . 
  omg what will the markets think of this ??? 
  nothing ? 
  carry on then . 
  read polish forums , i 've been reading this for years now . 
  it generally ends up with someone saying that `` hitler deep down loved poles , he just said he did n't , why he even used polish children in adoptions '' or talking about the whatshername commonwealth , etc , etc. 
  i get it though , it 's a way to align with those in a better position while carving a new identity in the post cold war world . 
  still , i must say that the whole thing is sometimes a bit too much : for example , i used to dabble in a human genetics forum and every time any west/east genetic cline was identified it was almost always the resident poles that contested it with anger . 
  this is of course anedoctical but at least shows that this `` let 's make it us against the south ! '', 
  has its share of supporters , concentrated around the specific interest groups of course so this is most likely something residual and restricted to those that have very specific agendas , and not representative of poles as a whole . 
  not that i care that much , i 'm definitely not nordic and quite happy that way so it 's the other eastern europeans that poland has to fight with for the spot . 
  as things go everyone north of the * limes * should consider a medallion system for nordic status . 
  i do n't have the number with me but i would say that the situation has changed in the last decade with widespread prohibitions on smoking in closed places , etc , etc. 
  that said smoking is far from odd , it 's common , say ... 20-30 % ? 
  perhaps more in some segments . 
  there is n't the social stigma attached to it compared with what i read about elsewhere ( the us , mainly ) , some people dislike it but it 's hardly something people feel to need to apologise about or feel embarrassed . 
  i know , i was being slightly sarcastic there . 
  that said brazil naturally tends to follow us practices ( like most or all south america ) whereas we have traditionally aligned with the rest of the continent ( france in the xix century , etc ) , so i would n't be surprised if there were differences , and it would n't even be bad , just rather natural . 
  and yes , we study brazilian literature in the curriculum : machado de assis of course , ot\u00e1vio bilac , monteiro lobato , jorge amado ... this from memory . 
  the xix authors are interesting because most people here are exposed to a more `` tropical '' literature from brazil ( say , neo-realism and amado ) but reading assis is a bit like reading e\u00e7a with the characters surrounded by a different physical reality .
