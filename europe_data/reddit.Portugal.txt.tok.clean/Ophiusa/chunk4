  you are so right it hurts :( it could even be an excuse for more cooperation : we would go there to see the aurora borealis , you would come here to get your solar fix in two days . 
  the current flag is a source of perennial debate . 
  i 'm a dangerous left-wing radical and even i feel that blue & white should have beek kept , the current flag has no historical precedence at all . 
  & gt ; so if i started to learn portuguese i would be able to understand spanish ? 
  yes , in general : portuguese has a wider phonological base then castillian ( this is not a qualitative statement on the languages ! ), 
  which means that if you understand portuguese you will mostly understand castillian since instead of six `` a '' sounds you will find one . 
  ummm good memories ... ( spent time in pontevedra in my late teens ) . 
  `` omg , we did something good - quick , sell it ! '', 
  sigh, 
  very interesting , i always found the austro-hungarian empire an interesting mix of tradition and novelty . 
  indeed - i am no stranger to agal and the whole reintegrationism debate , i 'm actually very partial and have been involved in it directly - as i said in another thread i used to spend time in lisbon 's xuventude de galicia and was pretty much surrounded we people which shared your outlook ( but also those who did not , of course ) . 
  i just try to separate the nationality issue from the cultural one since i think that the last one should be supported by galicians of all persuasions , even though it 's very hard to deny that typically those which stress galician and its relevance in the face of bilinguism and `` normalisation '' also tend to have a much less centralist perspective on spain and a better opinion of portugal . 
  & gt ; damn it , do n't know french . 
  i 'll try to find it with english subtitles on one of ... ahem ... those sites . 
  heh , good luck - check if there is some sort of automatic translation of subtitles though . 
  & gt ; ah lol i can totally relate to that . 
  i would n't say it is specific to any particular country , i think all nations have it more or less . 
  yes , of course , we are not a very special snow flake ( at least , not in everything ! ) . 
  in portugal what i described has however specific reasons and stems from this perceived imbalance between present and past . 
  & gt ; what 's the average monthly paycheck and what would you say , how much is enough money monthly for a normal , comfortable life without too much luxury ? 
  [ average monthly wage of employees ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/average+monthly+wage+of+employees+basic+remuneration+and+earnings-857 ) seems to be ~ 1000 $ . 
  lisbon is more expensive than , say , coimbra ( which is still a medium city , note that quality of living can be better outside of lisbon and indeed many foreigners end up living on smaller cities with great scenery and historical buildings ) . 
  i would say that you can live quite well on it , the main factor being how much you spend on rent ... there are people which live on 700 $ / month or less , but i would n't call it comfortable . 
  [ this supposedly compares prices and cost of living in serbia and portugal ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=serbia&amp;amp;country2=portugal ) , ca n't vouch for it but could be interesting ... 
  that 's a great question brigantium , and one which i addressed recently on thje topic of portuguese and galician languages ( in which i 'm a big defender of their unity in many aspects ) . 
  what i am about to say you most likely know quite well but could be interesting to others . 
  the issue here is complex , but it begins with the independence of portugal itself which was actually fuelled by animosity against galician nobles by the portucalense nobility , so in a way the independence of portugal was made against l\u00e9on and galicia as well - there is a reason why d. afonso henriques fought against his own mother , seen as partial to the interests of the galician nobility . 
  there were other , latter , episodes which could have turned this around ... there was those revolts in the end of the 15th century which wrecked havoc and iirc we mostly did nothing or opposed it , but the exact ideological context of those revolts were complex iirc ... in a way it almost reminded me of a * jacquerie * of sorts , although i 'm sure it had a `` national '' vein to it ... actually , the notion that because we are so similar we should constitute a single `` nation '' is something which only appeared in the 19th century during the `` spring of nations '' and romantic nationalism with an ethnic component - which is after all the time of [ pondal 's `` os pinos '' ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/os_pinos ) , with it 's stanza `` noble lusitania lends a friendly embrace [ ... ] and fulfils the uncertainties of your sounding pines oh people of br\u00e9ogan '' . 
  from then on we have been victims of different paths and often times official policies made to separate what is a cultural continuum fearing political implications : one just needs to remember the thoroughly anti-portuguese indoctrination with franco , for example , which was also followed with severe anti-galician propaganda ( `` galego \u00e9 l\u00edngua de labregos '' ) . 
  this endures to this day , and even if you seem to think otherwise there are many people in galiza which maintain a rather crude view on portugal ( and , sadly , vice-versa ) . 
  as i said in another topic , the portuguese language is galician with a country , an army and an empire . 
  whatever success portuguese achieved it should share it with galiza , which is after all mother of all . 
  t\u00f3til has made inroads in lisbon . 
  those are ordinary condiments though ... a bloody scourge in downtown lisbon since the police finds it hard to do anything about it : it 's not like you can say `` help , i 've been scammed , this is not cannabis but bay leaf !, 
  '' , and at the same time they ca n't lock them up for selling culinary herbs . 
  a big nuisance though , which has increased exponentially with the popularity of lisbon as a tourist destination . 
  first of all thank you for your kind comments . 
  the topic of portuguese national identity is one which seems to be as old as the country ( so pushing a millennium , almost ) ... every portuguese inherits this strange mix of fatalism , pessimism , longing and feeling of being born in the wrong epoch - as [ \u00c1lvaro de campos would put it ] ( http://www.citador.pt/poemas/opiario-alvaro-de-camposbrbheteronimo-de-fernando-pessoa ) : perten\u00e7o a um g\u00e9nero de portugueses que depois de estar a \u00cdndia descoberta ficaram sem trabalho . 
  a morte \u00e9 certa . 
  i belong to a breed of portuguese which after having discovered india lost their trade . 
  death is certain . 
  my mind often ponders in this . 
  if you do n't mind a somewhat academic apporach [ these pages ] ( https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/sites/default/files/assets/document/5%20onesimo%20talk%20oct%2002\\ ( 5 \\ ) . pdf ) touch upon many of the main issues , but it 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  as eduardo louren\u00e7o has postulated ( correctly imo ) we suffer from an `` hyper-identity '' complex , which is the explanation why you find so many of us saying the worst about the country and then saying the best . 
  if you 're absolutely bonkers i would say that [ non ou a v\u00e3 gl\u00f3ria de mandar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as-nhhyudha ) ( full movie , french subtitles ) is perhaps the movie which captures this absurdity the best : a manoel de oliveira film ( generally considered the best portuguese director , died recently ) set during the recent colonial wars in africa with the soldiers talking and doing flashbacks to some of the most critical periods of portuguese history , ending on the infamous battle of alc\u00e1cer quibir which is still part of our collective psyche , along with king sebastian . 
  the relation with brazil is governed by all of this : when things are fine they are our `` brother country '' and we tend to project in brazil our own past achievements , when things go south then , well , they are not . 
  language plays a significant role in how we view identity since we are ( mostly ) a nation-state with a single language , fixed borders and above all the discoveries which were what really made an enduring difference by creating a mythogeny common to us all and which is to this day what will , in the end , make any federalisation process impossible ( be it with spain or with the eu ) , even if it sometimes appears to be viewed favourably . 
  all that aside , it 's a good country to live in if you have some money with you , quite honestly : good weather , very low crime , natives are generally helpful and accommodating , smallish but with enough regional diversity and a mix of atlantic and mediterranean traits . 
  hope the markets take that into consideration . 
   - the neoliberal point of view continues to be the most dominant point of view in the european commission : all of the eu 's successes are always thanks to neoliberalism , and all of its failures are always the fault of social democratic policies . 
  one day this story could break , and the neoliberals will have to own up to some of the failures also . 
  i think that what recently changed was that it became so much apparent ... there was a time when it was less `` in your face '' , now the policies are clearly spelled out and written for others to sign , which is at least more transparent if not less unfortunate to those who have different views . 
  the recent events have truly changed the nature of european politics imo ; domestically , for example , it worked perfectly since our current government ( centre-right coalition , basically aligned with the troika ) received a certain boost and the socialist party immediately stopped any dialogue with parties to the left , while at the same time not having anything truly different to propose . 
  it is reaching a point which reminds me of a quote from a local politician who had just changed tickets for re-election , from the party who used to be government to the one which was then government : those who are with those in power eat , those who are not are left with the crumbles . 
  such a pragmatic perspective can very well maintain the current government in place , after all while even change if it is abundantly clear that deviating from a certain line will only bring even worse results ? 
  my predictions are that the current government will actually be able to maintain the majority of it plays the cards right . 
  the communist party will have the standard ~ 10 % and the syriza-like parties can go either way , but even with some popular politicians the recent events will likely have a negative impact on their votes . 
  we are always on the forefront !, 
  no , although there is the thing with solidarity which always comes into play . 
  that said there are a several examples of communist party held municipalities enacting laws against illegal immigrants and/or specific minorities ... 
  if the top of my head i remember the bulldozing of installations used to harbour migrants in a french city and the building of social housing for gypsies in segregated places outside the city walls in portugal . 
  this examples are however not exactly a proof of it being a policy , merely that when in power the policies can differ from what one would theoretically expect . 
  as for nationalism and socialism , it 's a debate on its own . 
  most parties consider themselves both patriotic and internationalist . 
  i have always struggled with being morbidly nationalistic myself while having very left wing economic positions . 
  it 's also a difficult debate because eventually one of those `` cultural marxism made me suck a black dong '' types appears and goes on about `` the nazis were national socialists '' and `` horseshoe theory '' and it all gets rather silly . 
  i am in general against mass migration , but i primarily blame it on the need for capitalism to maintain a reserve army of labour in order to drive wages down . 
  immigration from outside of europe adds another level of benefits since it 's more easily exploited given the lack of bonds that more often than not exist , and in that context the less homogeneous the better ( actually now that i think of it there is a certain foreboding of this in lenin with the concept of imperialism as the next step of capitalism ) . 
  iirc miterrand said that much clearly , that he used immigration as a way to weaken the unions . 
  as i said in another post i was pretty involved in this stuff in the early 90 's and one thing i can say is that the traditional voters of communist parties in europe are also the ones which are most threatened by immigration and which are more against it ... a paradox perhaps , but understandable when considering the sociological basis of said parties . 
  written using mobile , apologies for weird sentences and auto corrections . 
  this episode with greece has made me change my position , i now truly believe that austerity measures are warranted and more should be implemented : it 's absolutely clear that any country which calls itself sovereign must be absolutely prepared to leave the euro and eventually the eu . 
  not having that plan b prepared after what happened with greece is gross negligence . 
  [ they just write it off sch\u00e4uble !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xel65gywwhq ), 
  portugal fuck yeah !, 
  maybe the same as a priest ( a real one ... jk , jk ) and a deacon ... one is still laity even though he performs some rituals ? 
  i 'm afraid i 'm not sure what more to reply . 
  i began my comment with '' ... it 's interesting to note ... '' , implying an observation which while not directly linked with who pays what to whom in terms of the imf could be , well , interesting in a broader geo-political perspective . 
  you seem to find it without any interest since your focus seems to be what money goes from the pockets of angolan citizens to greek citizens - a worthy concern , but one which is lateral to my comment . 
   yea , and china are buying companies in europe yet a huge chunk of their population is dirt poor . 
  indeed , the other half of companies which were privatised ( the electricity production and grid , for example ) went to chinese national companies - it seems that they were sort of nationalised but by the cpc , in a way . 
   that is still not a reason to take money from angolian citizen and put in the pockets of greek citizen i was pointing out how countries which are very poor are at the same time racking up companies in europe . 
  that said i do not think that the pockets of ordinary greek or angolan citizens are the main factor in any of this . 
  indeed , more of the same pathetic little theatre we 've grown used over here : grand statements during the week , followed by the sending of imf technocrats which do n't give a shit and demand absolute compliance with previous terms . 
  it 's not even funny anymore , just tiresome - schultz being another typical performer in this charades , amongst others . 
  it 's not even about agreeing or not , or being left or right-wing , it 's just ... silly . 
  edit : for those who apparently silently disagree : [ troika admits imf mistake but maintains austerity plans unchanged ] ( https://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2feconomico.sapo.pt%2fnoticias%2ftroika-assume-erro-do-fmi-mas-diz-que-ajustamento-e-para-manter_183483.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) :  representatives of the ` troika ' recognize the claims of christine lagarde , who has admitted the `` error '' regarding the effects of austerity , but say the adjustment program is to maintain  `` once again did not admit mistakes , '' said the president of cip , although the elements of the troika have assumed the positions of managing director of the imf . 
  `` while recognizing that the magnitude of the recessionary effects was higher than expected and generated effects - unemployment , the closure of businesses - larger than expected , still have not proven to correct the trajectory , '' said scott , adding that the program adjustment serves to correct `` some inadequacies '' but does not solve the underlying problem . 
  `` not only are not to repair the boat as we are happily - like the titanic - to continue to play the orchestra and the boat to sink , '' he concluded . 
  this is from a centre-right newspaper , and those complaining about the apparent contradiction are not the evil labour unions but representatives of the industry owners . 
  this is but one example . 
  my point was obvious : that countries which were described as in lowest echelons of the imf are buying companies in europe which are being privatised per the policy of the imf . 
  you might not find it interesting or worth pointing out , but that 's a different matter . 
  as for the citizens of angola i doubt they will lose their money , even because outside approved oligarchies they have n't much of it to begin with . 
  that 's a different topic though , and even that being what it is they are much better than during the civil war . 
  thank you for your reply  thanks to the financial crisis , not anymore . 
  will have to read a bit more into that then , i 'm afraid i know more about 20th century ireland than recent events - any link which you think might be helpful ? 
   context is important precisely , that was actually my main point , i think most of europe dabbled with fascism in the twenties and thirties ... ffs , even israel .
