  glad it helped but bear in mind that your experience is what really matters : every country in europe has more than enough attractions to fill some videos and photos . 
  spain has a lot of very interesting stuff and some of it of a scale which you will not find in portugal ( e.g. 
  our south does n't have the huge muslim palaces because it was reconquered some centuries before ) . 
  likewise for , say , fine-art museums , madrid has us beaten easily there ( even because the 1755 earthquake destroyed most of our collections ) . 
  i 'm trying to be as honest as possible here , some people come here and absolutely love it , others do n't feel it was worth the visit , it also depends on what you 're after and where you go . 
  some french can be useful , especially when dealing with older generations since most people learned french as their first foreign language until the eighties . 
  excellent suggestion , one of my all times favorite . 
  this threads can easily turn into `` my country is the bestest '' kind of thing , i 'll try to be as objective as possible , & gt ; my main considerations would be cost of living , in terms of food and housing , most surveys have cost of living as france & gt ; spain & gt ; portugal . 
  there is a difference between cities , especially capital cities and the rest . 
  additionally , these surveys are not completely correct and there is room for error ( e.g. 
  people in portugal who live near the border with spain go to spain to buy groceries , petrol and gas , amongst others , something which would n't make sense if the cost of living was higher there ) , but they will give you an idea . 
  & gt ; safety i 'm sure they are all safe cities . 
  lisbon has been several times considered the [ safest big city in europe ] ( http://www.visitingportugal.com/blog/lisbon-safest-city-in-europe/ ) but i suppose this fluctuates . 
  still , i would n't consider any of the cites you mentioned as particularly dangerous . 
  & gt ; how connected the country is to most of central europe also plays a big part well , this is easy then . 
  portugal is the westernmost nation in the european continent so it can hardly compete in that area . 
  it is connected to france via the iberian rail infrastructure , and i say iberian because we use a different gauge so you change trains in the pyrenees ( with some exceptions ) . 
  this requirement is almost mathematical in the way it can be answered : lisbon is further away , the madrid , then pamplona , then the french cities . 
  lisbon and madrid have international airports , of course , and participate in inter rail agreements ( http://www.interrail.eu ) . 
  if this is a big part of your requirements then france ( and pamplona next ) is the way to go . 
  & gt ; i personally have been to france and spain , and i really like them , which is why i have shortlisted them as one of my options , but i felt that portugal may be an interesting alternative to spain , perhaps also a cheaper option . 
  france and spain are great to visit . 
  so is portugal , even if less known . 
  portugal has one [ multiple world tourism awards ] ( http://www.worldtravelawards.com/winners2014-8 ) ( also , [ here ] ( http://www.vaprealestate.com/news-detail/wta-world-tourism-awards-portugal-algarve-lisboa-madeira_136 ) or [ here ] ( http://www.internationalmeetingsreview.com/portugal/portugal-takes-multiple-awards-world-travel-awards-europe-2014-99637 ) ) , and lisbon has , on top of the several ones mentioned before such as best urban destination , it also one several best european destination ( this year it [ came in second ] ( http://www.ecotoursportugal.com/blog/20152/lisbon-the-second-best-european-destination-for-2015.aspx ) , with bordeaux as 1st , [ source ] ( http://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/top/europe-best-destinations-2015/ ) ) , lonely planet top 10 2012 , european city of the year 2012 ( [ here ] ( http://www.eturbonews.com/26742/lisbon-wins-european-city-year-2012-and-unesco-award-fado ) ) , etc , etc. 
  that said , i would say that if i had to pick one advantage of lisbon or portugal is that it packs some variety in a small amount of space . 
  i would say that 2/3 of the sceneries [ in this award-winning promotional video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipeja_vfjjo ) are within 1:30 h of lisbon . 
  you go [ from the beach in estoril ] ( http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/cascais-estoril/tamariz-beach-01.jpg ) , which is in the lisbon area , to [ sintra ] ( http://shoppingspirit.pt/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/parques-de-sintra-promove-parques-e-monumentos-na-itb.jpg ) , also in the lisbon area , in 20 minutes . 
  you never said which languages you speak . 
  in my experience portugal is slightly better for those not speaking the native tongue in that most people will speak a little bit of english , but the newer generations in all three countries are rather similar in this . 
  there is a lot to like and seen in france or spain so it all boils down to you wanting to revisit and rediscover what you like or take a chance . 
  & gt ; on a side note , croatia ( zagreb ) and lithuania ( vilnius ) are a couple of interesting options that i came across as well , but i personally do not know much about these countries . 
  how would they fare based on the criteria above ? 
  sadly i have n't visited them so i ca n't offer advice . 
   1000 $ per month let 's not focus on the well-off though . 
   they do n't need to take on russia alone because they have friends . 
  friends come and go , as the countries going through economic difficulties know well enough . 
  someone down the road might say that some tough love is what estonia needs since they were not responsible enough with their foreign diplomacy and it is hardly to be expected that countries which behaved responsibly in that regard share the burden . 
  i have a somewhat different point-of-view , and one which i do n't particularly find myself proud of but which under the mantle of anonymity i can partially disclose . 
  i 've been thinking of moving to some other country for some years now , mainly because i feel my children would benefit from a bilingual education which is stable , it would open up a lot of opportunities for them . 
  i 'm middle-class ( or slightly upper middle class , perhaps , at least here ) so it 's not like i 'm desperate to get out , i live in a nice flat five minutes from the beach in what most would consider a resort , etc , etc. 
  that said , england would likely be my first choice since it 's the language i speak better ( apart from my own ) and some other reasons more tied with some academic endeavours i have planned . 
  the problem being , whenever i go to london and walk though some neighbourhoods , jesus , i 'm not going to leave what i have here to go to to * that * . 
  which leads me to my completely hypocritical position , even more so when i vote for the `` extreme left '' : stricter immigration rules in the uk would likely work well enough from my perspective since i do not plan to move somewhere without absolutely making sure i 'm needed and wanted there , and i would gladly go through an immigration process if that meant that five years down the road i would n't be regretting my surroundings . 
  i 'm such a knob , i know , but your comment for some reason prompted me to be honest ... this applies not only to the uk by the way , it 's almost as if i 'm caught in a marxist ( of the groucho variety ) idea of `` i will not be a member of any club which allows me as member '' . 
  i 'll delete this latter so i can continue to plan the worker 's uprising without being pointed out as irremediably reactionary . 
  ps : ahh , and the most often retort is `` but what about the portuguese abroad ??? '', 
  - which i find immensely interesting since it generally comes from those who maintain that nationality is an artificial construct that means nothing , but somehow i should in this case feel such a profound ethnic empathy that i 'm prepared to sacrifice my family 's quality of life for the benefit of those earning more than me abroad . 
  my wife , to give an example , is a specialist healthcare professional with postgraduate education and earns less here than someone doing housecleaning chores in luxembourg , but somehow we should be further penalised by accepting all sorts of policies since we must think of those working abroad . 
  bloody protestants always dropping a kid every year , must have run out of french ticklers . 
  yes , they are perhaps complementary colours in a cmyk colourspace or something like that , but i think he used the word as in `` look good together '' way . 
  depends on taste of course , but consider that in heraldry colour-on-colour is not allowed in general , and in particular in this kind of simple arrangement . 
  flags do not have to follow heraldic rules ... but when they do the result is generally better . 
  notice how even a complex design as the union flag follows that rule , and the same for our own previous flags ( including the united kingdom of portugal and brazil in which the blue was separated by gold , and obviously the liberal one which is a simple blue/silver split ) . 
  thank you for your comment , i was superficially aware of some of that since vexillology is one of my interests . 
  i guess that due to recent coups we both ended up trading in traditional colours for new ones . 
  the difference being that your final arragement looks good ( i 'm not sold on the merchant flag you referenced , the state flag however also looked good so you would n't lose much either way ) . 
  no offence taken . 
  the greek flag has nice colours . 
  the cross in the canton is a solid and classic design . 
  the adding of stripes however makes the whole arrangement slightly strange to look at , sort of an optical illusion image . 
  a non-stripped version would look better . 
   that was the only different flag i knew from portugal . 
  seen in various simulation games . 
  thought it was just a marine flag . 
  actually , that one is the one to know . 
  after all been said and done that is the one that is always there ( in the present one it 's the shield in the centre ) . 
  it was the most common during the middle ages since there was no concept of `` national flag '' , countries used the coat-of-arms of the reigning family ( see [ here ] ( http://www.infoescola.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/batalha_de_aljubarrota.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h7l2t2m42k8/tu4byafqt5i/aaaaaaaaawc/j9fmmvkilno/s1600/tape%25c3%25a7aria+pastrana+batalha+conquista+de+arzila.gif ) or [ here ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/388/2562/1600/portugal.jpg ) . 
  there was no difference at the time between land or maritime flags apart from whatever differences were needed to make it work ( and this is the reason why many maritime flags are not symmetrical , they tend to wear out due to the wind and thus the outer part is made longer ) . 
  it was only in the xvii century that a clear separation between personal flag and coat-of-arms appeared , and in the beginning it was simply the shield on a completely white field . 
  it changed to different arragements of blue and white simply because it is the colour of the centre of the shield and the one present from the very beginning . 
  ps : there is one proposal there which is just making fun of the entire thing , it 's the one with playing cards , a crown and a phrygian cap , it 's called `` reconciliation '' since it contains everything and the kitchen sink !, 
   people associate a blue cross on white with finland because that 's their current flag . 
  you could complain if portugal also had a similar flag . 
  obviously . 
  i never said i found it strange did i ? 
   it does n't matter if you had it first . 
  i was replying to a comment which mentioned unease with possible wring associations of the flag . 
  since there are not copyrights on flags historical background is relevant , especially when they are recent and/or have been adopted recently . 
  it likely is , because it was n't too cold for the previous nine centuries . 
  the current one is indeed `` warm '' if by that we mean something out of an hawaiian shirt or central african guard of honour parade . 
  it is however absolutely to be expected that you associate the current one with portugal and see the others as less appropriate , it 's both a matter of being exposed to it and also a certain tendency for considering southern europe as `` tropical '' , as it were . 
  until 1910 portugal always used blue and white alone or bue and white inside the traditional banner ( which is our current coat-of-arms ) .

  the only competition with blue and white would be red and white since those were the colours used by the order of christ and the order of st. james and which appear on the sails . 
  red and green was something out of the positivist influences of early republicans . 
  if you want a good laugh you can see [ the proposals for a new flag ] ( http://5outubro.centenariorepublica.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100&amp;itemid=98 ) which were `` considered '' after 1910 , you can clearly see that half of them tried to retain the blue & white pattern . 
   they 're not solid foundations when they 're based on ambiguous terms and historical myths . 
  i 'm afraid i would have to know more in detail what you 're referring to . 
  there is plenty of complexity in the `` rights '' and many movements and schools of thought therein go far above historical myths and ambiguous terms , having clearly defined programmes and ideological foundations , regardless of one 's lack of empathy towards them . 
   the most well known far-right leader in portugal is a brute converted to lawyer . 
  and the most well-known former minister of salazar who inaugurated the tarrafal concentration camp was the former president of the academy of sciences . 
  yeah mate , your flag is n't exactly a world beater . 
  looks like something out of bauhaus ... the colours are cool , but the geometric patterns make it look like a jigsaw . 
  the one you suggested is much better of course . 
  no , i hate it . 
  it 's beyond ugly and the only redeeming feature is the coat-of-arms which they fortunately left alone . 
  that people ( mainly immigrants , perhaps they need to have something to like about the country to begin with ) say that `` it 's the most beautiful flag in the world '' is to me proof that somethings should n't be left to chance or to the tastes of the masses . 
  just [ pick and choose any of the previous flags ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_portugal#evolution ) , even the worst one is best than the current one ( which has little more than one century and represented a complete and radical break with all traditional colours in the former nine centuries ) . 
  i am partial to the previous one ( simply split the field in blue and white and put the coat-of-arms in the middle ) but with a round/iberian shield instead of curvy/french one , or use the first one with a regular blue cross in silver field and stick the coat-of-arms in the middle . 
  i saw this somewhere online once and it looked nice .
