  as gods . 
  cam\u00f5es and fernando pessoa are the two pillars of our literature . 
  everyone in the country knows about them . 
  poetry is without doubt one of the most highly regarded arts here . 
  portuguese is still called ` the language of cam\u00f5es ' . 
  i do n't think my country is better than others but i absolutely love nearly everything about it . 
  people , food , music , the sea , the beaches , the mountains , the food , the wine ... 
  i have no problem calling myself a patriotic person . 
  edit : one person put the meaning below :  having or expressing devotion to and vigorous support for one 's country . 
  and i have changed my mind . 
  i did n't know that was the meaning of ` patriotic ' . 
  i just love my country as it is . 
  if the whole country changed i would n't love it just because it 's where i was born . 
  jesus fucking christ , i 'm saying this for your sake . 
  not trying to be mean or anything but you should get a life . 
  hang out with some friends , do some sports ... anything . 
  portugal and brazil is very similar to uk and us .

  the leopard is great, 
  any topic , although it 's most frequently used in sports . 
  armchair manager in english . 
  it means ` manager from the stands ' . 
  referring to the better ( and only ) football obviously ,

  if their portuguese is good enough , i 'll speak portuguese . 
  if their portuguese is n't good enough , i 'll try english . 
  i 'll apreciate the effort though , even if they 're bad at it . 
  kellogs and yogurt for life, 
  you 've got to have the right friends ... but it comes from the same place as yours, 
  sell drugs mainly to tourists without them knowing they 're buying bay leaves . 
  lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu%c3%ads_de_cam%c3%b5es he was so good portuguese is now called ` the language of cam\u00f5es ' . 
  consider porto and lagos ( the last one being for the summer only ) in portugal . 
  you should be fine in lisbon though . 
  i do n't know how to translate it properly . 
  there are two or three plants . 
  they make it seem like it 's drugs since they can get it for free or for a low price . 
  then they sell it with a huge profit to tourists or uninformed people . 
  and they do n't take chances with the police since they ca n't get arrested for it . 
  nope . 
  still the same . 
  those are not drugs they 're selling btw . 
  that 's why the cops ca n't do anything about it, 
  things got pretty crazy here during the euros but i 'm not sure that counts as nationalism . 
  we are a very diverse country ( these days half the time i get on the subway i hear a foreign language ) and we have that attitude that we love to badmouth our country but if anyone else says it , we 'll get pissed at them . 
  i think we 're nationalistic in a good way . 
  proud of our history but the current state of the country helps us stay humble . 
  this is from the team i support just last week : https://youtu.be/gcy28ty3fsy it was on a tuesday , so the atmosphere was n't up to scratch , but still pretty good . 
  if you search for fans on a derby day , it 's completely insane . 
  50 thousand people jumping up and down screaming on top of their lungs . 
  i 'm going for a match right now actually . 
  away at guimar\u00e3es . 
  hopefully we get those 3 points , 
  i 'm speaking for my club only , but if you put 10 thousand sporting fans in a packed 80000 people stadium in america you can be 100 % sure you 'll only hear them singing . 
  the fact that there are more people rarely says anything about the noise . 
  in fact , away fans , who generally have less people are a lot of the time the louder ones . 
  what are you on about ? 
  we just won the euros . 
  that will mask our depression for at least a few more months !, 
  the spanish do the same thing i think . 
  it means up ( raise the drink ) , down ( lower the drink ) , to the middle ( put the drink in the middle ) and inside ( drink it ) . 
  the classy thing is just saying sa\u00fade ( health ) or chim chim ( sound of the cups touching ) . 
  p\u00e3o , p\u00e3o , queijo , queijo - bread , bread , cheese , cheese - it means something is very simple s\u00e3o muitos anos a virar frangos - it 's too many years turning chickens - it means someone is experienced engolir sapos - swallowing frogs - it means someone has to hear something they do n't like para ingl\u00eas ver - for the english to see - it means someone is showing off, 
  you ask someone to take a picture . 
  i 'm sure they 'll be happy to . 
  the tarkovsky movie is very different , but every bit as good . 
  here in portugal , we say ` santinho ' , which translates to ` little saint ' . 
  the justification for this is that you sneezed because there was a saint passing near you . 
  pretty religious and weird too . 
  yes . 
  but i do n't remember them . 
  and we do n't have similar rules in portuguese . 
  i do n't enjoy every single type of codfish meal . 
  hopefully my fellow brothers can forgive me . 
   i moved about 800km ( by car ) this cracked me up so much, 
  from portugal : [ carlos paredes ] ( https://youtu.be/ufgcturygp4 ) [ am\u00e1lia ] ( https://youtu.be/ufgcturygp4 ), 
   i recently found out that there 's a movement in portugal for a spanish-portuguese union , like it 's a real thing . 
  if that exists , it 's a very very small group of people . 
  and it will obviously never happen . 
  it 's a portuguese thing where people tend to just spout some crazy ideas , just to get some sort of discussion going . 
  i guarantee you 99.9 % would hate that idea . 
  90 % of the population lives closer to the ocean than to spain . 
  so , that must be true ahah but seriously , there 's a brotherly love-hate relationship with spain . 
  everyone here calls you ` nuestros hermanos ' . 
  we just do n't like it when the spanish think they 're better than us or when people think of us as that little irrelevant country that might aswell be spain . 
  can confirm . 
  there 's no best way to start a day than eating a pastel de nata and drinking some coffee . 
  we 're proud of our history and the ammount of ` new land ' we discovered . 
  our national anthem still starts with ` her\u00f3is do mar ' ( heroes of the sea ) . 
  currently , we have a pretty good relationship with brazil . 
  the relashionship with the ex-colonies in africa is n't fully repared from the colonial war ( during our dictatorship ) , but those countries are looked at as huge opportunities and there 's plenty of investment going there . 
  the ex-colonies in asia are pretty much forgotten , but there are plenty of cultural similarities . 
  [ remember when we divided the world in two ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) fun times , until the rest of europe started robbing us . 
  fuck you england , netherlands and france . 
  fuck you . 
  \u00c9der, 
  i fell in love in la vie d'adele, 
  coffee + pastry cereal with milk or yogurt fruit sandwich or toast, 
  nope . 
  we had some good kings but a lot of them were properly stupid .
