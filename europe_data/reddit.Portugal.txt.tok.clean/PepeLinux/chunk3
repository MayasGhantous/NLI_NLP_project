  ps : i now realize this is a bit off-topic , but i think it 's interesting . 
  if ** anybody ** dares to mention drinking tea ... 
  europe wo n't save a country that does n't exist . 
   the article did n't exclude bailouts as an option for economically weak countries . 
  then it 's not really a darwinist system , is it ? 
  i do n't know , maybe because it would be a violation of territorial sovereignty of the host countries ? 
  would it help ? 
  would it not be a waste of money ? 
  even poor old charlie ... 
  these are the same people who support free speech religiously , but then turn around and argue that a fringe political group , even though it has a few supporters , not getting any representation is good . 
  well , give one example ( honest request , not trying to imply anything ) . 
  i wonder why you 're still butthurt about the immigration megathread . 
  uhm ... * i wonder ... *, 
  at least we 'll get rid of strikes because there is no boss to tell us what to do . 
  it 's still in negotiation , so it 's not public , but you 're right , more people should know about it . 
  * tips fedora *, 
  where 's the conspiracy ? 
  that 's just an opinion . 
  canada and australia are pretty much european countries . 
  / s but that * would * be fine . 
  or / r/trees . 
   - primary budget deficit of 0.25 percent of gdp in 2015 , followed by surpluses of 0.5 percent in 2016 , 1.75 percent in 2017 , and 3.5 percent in 2018 . 
   - greek economy to shrink between 2.1 and 2.3 pct in 2015 , contract by 0.5 percent in 2016 , and return to 2.3 percent growth in 2017 . 
  just like many people have trouble trusting the greeks about the former , they should also have trouble trusting the creditors about the latter . 
  but you know , the uk 's blacks come from africa , so they really are more violent , so that 's why the proportions are justified . 
   they just wanted a reason to declare war on germany that could n't be further from the truth . 
  if they wanted a reason to declare war on germany , they could have done it as early as 1936 . 
  the allied powers were doing everything they could to avoid another war ( which when the war inevitability came , made france surrender faster than anyone thought , and would have done the same to the uk had they not been separated from the continent ) . 
   frighteningly , the idea of the great ** victory ** overcomes the idea of the great ** victory ** over time , especially in a last couple of years . 
  i 'm guessing the former is right , and the later is a mistake , right ? 
   we also often criticize ourselves for our role as a neutral party . 
  a lot of people feel like we should 've entered the war on the side of the allies instead of trying to play and profit from both sides ( a lot of people do n't like how a big part of our gold treasury is from selling stuff to the nazis ) . 
  apart from the obvious moral reasons for this there 's also the us help in the post war period that we did n't get because we were n't involved . 
  to be fair , we did n't go to war because the uk did n't want us to . 
  if portugal joined the war on the side of the allies , spain would have probably also joined the war , but on the side of the axis powers . 
  churchill did n't ask for portugal 's assistance because of this . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal_in_world_war_ii#military_cooperation ) but i agree with you that there is ( imo rightly ) more emphasis on the ussr 's role in the war . 
  my former phylosophy teacher wrote a book about that : [ `` portugal e galiza -- encantos e encontros '' by jos\u00e9 david santos ara\u00fajo ] ( http://nacionalismo-de-futuro.blogspot.pt/2004/05/portugal-e-galiza-encantos-e-encontros.html ) he was also a co-author of the book `` portugal e galiza : uma na\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 ! '', 
  which translates to `` portugal and galiza : one nation only ! '', 
  i would wager spain is n't so enthusiastic about this . 
  on a side note : gib oliven\u00e7a !, 
  that will surely attract a lot of russian tourists . 
  what !? 
  how could you ? ... 
  omg , this is not happening , this ca n't be happening , brb gon na kill myself ... 
  i fail to see what 's the controversy some people are angry about . 
  can someone explain ? 
  i for one think he 's a spaniard watching from the sidelines . 
  awesome !, 
  but this time , do it [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_map ) . 
  something something trianon something something, 
  yes because he helped them in the first place . 
  unfortunately , the current center-right government . 
  i do n't believe austerity is the answer , but there is n't a choice . 
  it 's either austerity or bankruptcy , and even then , we might not be safe due to the debt 's questionable sustainability . 
  i believe that , in an optimal scenario , the debt levels should be lowered during economic growth , and increased during a recession , so that we are able to recover from it without running out of money to finance the country . 
  unfortunately , all political parties are a monolith . 
  either they favor investing in the economy though budget deficits under every circumstance , or they insist on sacrificing economic growth to reduce the debt , again under every circumstance . 
  so i would vote for psd because they are committed to reducing the deficit and debt to sustainable levels . 
  i do n't believe ps ( center-left ) would be able to end austerity without breaking the rules of the eurozone ( which is what they are promising ) . 
  i do n't want to be out of the euro , which is what the leftist parties want to end austerity ( though they do n't say it out-loud ) . 
  and i do n't want to vote for conservatives ( cds-pp ) . 
  yes , psd are still kind of conservative , and i believe that ps would legalize adoption for gay couples if elected , but the economy is a more important issue , and i believe psd would n't change much in regard to social issues . 
  the only thing that would change my mind is if i knew that ps 's plan for the country ( end austerity but remain on the euro and do n't restructure the debt ) would work . 
  if you want to change my hypothetical vote ( i 'll still be underage when the elections come around ) , that 's the only way . 
   this would n't be happening if puerto rico was a state honest question : why ? 
  and the target just got smaller . 
  each region should be a country of it own !, 
  get rid of nationalism for once . 
  if you do n't have money to pay taxes , you can still have education . 
  that 's why we say it 's free . 
  no need to be obtuse . 
  the difference between all those and holocaust denial is that holocaust denial is considered to incite hate on many minorities , especially jews , while others are just harmless opinions . 
  it 's not about political correctness , it 's about determining whether something motivates other people to commit crimes or not . 
   wow , i seriously ca n't understand how an educated person thinks that simply `` banning '' a party removes their supporters and eliminates their ideology . 
  politicians are n't just representatives . 
  with the media , they are also able to affect public opinion . 
  if even 3 or 4 politicians espouse hatred towards a certain minority ( for example ) , that hatred will be legitimized in the minds of many people . 
  yes , i 'm assuming many people are ignorant , because it 's true . 
  they are easily convinced , and that 's why many people support anti hate speech laws . 
  this is what many do n't understand . 
  in a modern democracy , the road between public opinion and politics goes both ways . 
  the public will come together and influence politics by voting or forming political parties . 
  and politicians will use their communication abilities to persuade people to their camp . 
  that 's why you have activist groups . 
  they help to widen the base of people who share an opinion . 
  if you ban a certain activist group ( for whatever reasons , legitimate or not ) , they wo n't be about to influence the public as effectively and , as a consequence , less people will share their opinion . 
  here 's an example : many communist regimes were against the religious establishments and acted against them . 
  now , people in those countries are less religious because they were n't influenced by religious leaders . 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  why ? 
  actually , it 's pretty clear . 
  it tells us that they are refugees . 
  thanks . 
  having regulated free markets , social democracy , is still having free markets and practicing capitalism . 
  you 're criticizing laiser-faire capitalism , and i agree with you , but that does n't make people affected by capitalism ` victims ' in the sense that we would send the victimizers to prison . 
  my father and his ` discipline ' . 
  or just dealing with people in general , except for my sister and my mother . 
  well , actually , the european parliament has a pretty good track record on these things , but that was n't my point . 
  no german would dare doing the same to the americans , and for good reason .
