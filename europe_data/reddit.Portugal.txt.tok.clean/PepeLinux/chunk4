  he reserves his , and only his , right to take away your freedoms one by one . 
   and there are victims , the people who 's wages go down as a result of the availability of a cheaper work force . 
  unless you 're arguing against the free market and all of its consequences , from poverty to inequality to unemployment , then i ca n't take your argument seriously . 
  in a modern capitalist state , those people are not considered victims .

  ftfy . 
  that said , there is not a [ single bad photo of our pm ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=passos+coelho&amp;biw=1400&amp;bih=880&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmik8bp9ukmxwivhlouch2quazp ) . 
  but do n't feel bad , there 's also not a [ single * good * photo of our president ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=cavaco+silva&amp;biw=1400&amp;bih=880&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchminoehouomxwivyzguch2o1q65 ) . 
  it 's decided !, 
  the uk will stay !, 
  that 's just too much . 
  why would you send someone to prison for a crime which had no victim ? 
  people have to understand that there are mainly two reasons why we send people to jail , and these do not apply here : - to keep the public safe . 
  that 's very simple . 
  if a serial killer is on the loose , you want him to be in prison so he does n't kill anyone else . 
  in this case , not checking your tenants ' immigration status does n't harm anyone , and does n't indicate that you will do so . 
  - to rehabilitate criminals . 
  people who steal get sent to prison to keep the public safe , and hopefully to rehabilitate them . 
  these landlords do n't need imprisonment , they need a good fine . 
   ** portuguese footballer nuno silva sparks row by wearing franco t-shirt . 
  `` the lad did n't have a clue who he was '' . 
  **  then there was the more right of centre press who took issue over something entirely different :  `` francoists should be the ones who are really outraged , '' wrote daily newspaper abc . 
   `` franco never wore t-shirts , he was always dressed much more appropriately . '', 
  your move , the onion . 
  as it currently stands , i ca n't see a european army being more than a european nato with federation-style decision making . 
  there 's no way countries would give up their own military because it 's both stupid and unconstitutional , and there 's no way smaller countries would let bigger ones decide for them what to do with the army . 
  so , what will happen will be this : each country either provides armament and manpower to the eu military , or funding ( similar to nato 's spending target maybe ) . 
  then , military interventions would have to be approved unanimously , so that more militaristic countries such as the uk , france and poland , do n't drag the rest of the eu with them . 
  if they want to militarily intervene without support of the whole eu , either do it by themselves , or do something like the coalition of the willing . 
   big us-states like california or texas ca n't veto a decision made by the congress/president just because they are the largest contributors to the military . 
  but the us does n't work like the eu . 
  the us is a state in and of itself . 
  the eu is just a union . 
  the eu to the us are n't the same thing . 
  one , we are n't that integrated ; and two , we can actually change the ` course ' of the union . 
  if we do n't like something about the us , we are n't doomed to repeat the same mistake . 
  so , just as we require unanimity to apply sanctions against russia , i ca n't see why we would n't do the same for every military intervention . 
  what was it ?!, 
  well , you see , refugees are not really people ... / s, 
  leave snoop alone !, 
  and countries that have the euro are for it . 
  what 's your point ? 
  give the guy a break !, 
  he 's stating his opinion , and because of some stuff he did before , you downvote him mercilessly . 
  / r/europe , why so serious ? 
  some people are also for mob justice . 
  but how do you know they did have an inflated budget by 150 % specifically ? 
  i 'm not arguing that the greek data is reliable , but you ca n't just take the measures in the memorandum as the perfect medicine for greece 's problems . 
  after all , that plan was agreed on in 2010 , when they was no reliable data anyway . 
  that 's a weird graph . 
  it 's kind of confusing and somewhat misleading . 
  - why is the base line 60 * percent of gdp * and the bars measured in * billions of debt * ? 
  it does n't make sense . 
  if you want to show how much a country is spending over the target , show it as a percentage of gdp , just like the base line ( the target ) . 
  - it does not take the size of the economy into account . 
  by looking at this graph , some people might have the false notion that italy is in a worse situation than greece , when it 's not true . 
  it 's just that italy 's and france 's economy is much bigger than greece 's . 
  - it does not take gdp growth into account . 
  so what if debt rises ? 
  if gdp also rises , the debt to gdp ratio is not affected , or less affected that what the graph leads to believe . 
  i actually agree with you on your overall point : governments , before elections , will spend more to gain votes . 
  i 'm just criticizing the choice of graph . 
  ** portugal ** : disclaimer : sorry if it 's a little biased or inaccurate , i welcome any corrections . 
  left block : radical leftists , anti-austerity , for full nationalization of the banks , for lgbt rights . 
  similar to syriza in greece and podemos in spain ( except for the popularity ) . 
  communist party ( pcp ) : communists , anti-austerity , anti-euro , convervatives . 
  third biggest party , but was never in government because they get their power from their close ties with the unions . 
  green party : environmentalists . 
  social democrats , pro-lgbt rights , but obviously with a focus on the environment . 
  ps : center-left social democrats . 
  main opposition party who 's been in and out of government since 1975 . 
  they want to `` end austerity while still respecting the rules of the eu '' which just means a lighter austerity . 
  they are pro-eu , pro-euro , socially progressive ( party that made gay marriage legal ) . 
  psd : center-right neoliberals . 
  current ruling party . 
  they are for austerity ( although they have to hide it somewhat ) , pro-eu , pro-euro , and range from conservatives to social liberals , but they mainly lean conservative ( on social issues , each mp votes on their own , there is no party line ) . 
  cdp-pp : right-wing party . 
  often in government as a coalition partner ( like right now ) . 
  conservatives . 
  psd 's little brother , some call them . 
  they often try to portray themselves as centrists ( last year , they pushed for and got passed new taxes on plastic bags and other things to help the environment ) . 
  there are also many other parties , but they are too small to get a seat in parliament . 
  they are mostly left-wing parties , and the reason why the left is so divided in portugal , and why the left bloc has lost its popularity ( they used to be the 3rd largest party , ahead of pcp and cdp-pp , but now they 've lost it ), 
  you know , except the jews , the gipsies , handicapped , retarded , all those ` undesirables ' . 
  a single women 's perception is not reality . 
  yes , hitler might have done some good things , but to state that `` there was no crime , everyone had a job and food '' is an exaggeration . 
  even if that 's true ( which i doubt given the post-depression economy ) , it 's not something we should strive for because it means violating human rights of minorities . 
  are you trolling ? 
  can you provide an example ? 
  defending hitler without a source is like asking to be downvoted . 
   and basically any country with a civilian nuclear program can build nukes , so that is nothing special . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  unless i 'm misinterpreting . 
  found [ this ] ( http://m.livescience.com/42238-debunking-myths-on-nuclear-power-it-s-not-for-making-bombs.html ) article :  all of the technical factors can be circumvented with sufficient time and money . 
  uneconomic fuel cycles can be run and warheads built with high levels of radioactivity . 
  however , no country has developed indigenous nuclear weapons after deploying civilian nuclear power stations . 
   historically , if a country wants to produce a nuclear bomb , they build reactors especially for the job of making plutonium , and ignore civilian power stations . 
  germany in 1933 was just perfect . 
  we all want iran to not have a nuclear weapon , so there 's that . 
  but i do agree that it 's mainly the us who is pushing for this , regardless of who come out ahead in the deal .
