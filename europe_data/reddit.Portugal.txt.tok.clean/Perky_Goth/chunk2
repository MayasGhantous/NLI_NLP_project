  that is certainly not true in many countries across the eu . 
  just in time for the implosion !, 
  as long as you keep mandating stupid asinine anti-european austerity , we wo n't . 
  not that it matters , it 's way beyond unpayable at this point . 
  also , you forgot ireland , it 's in a depression again . 
  completely unsurprising for anyone with a brain . 
  when a country has to rule against it 's people , going further into an authoritarian state is unavoidable . 
  at least now turkey joining makes sense , they are ready for the way the european masters want things to be run . 
  for big values of somewhat . 
   it takes a lot of trust in economic fairytales to imagine a society running without it . 
  we already trust in the market fairytale , what 's one more ? 
  at least that one does n't have to be defended by a huge amount of bullshit . 
  as long as you do n't pay attention to the ever increasing number of beggars , thieves and food scavengers , to the unemployment or closed businesses , to the starving children who faint in class and you wo n't see the austerity . 
  it 's the greek 's fault !, 
  why have they stopped consuming ? 
  they are n't helping !, 
  no , it was obvious to anyone with a clue that austerity would only make everything worse and anyone who still has n't gotten it does n't care that 3 or 4 countries will be turned into 3rd world shitholes to keep the fantasy of a sustainable financial system alive . 
  sometimes i can reach around 15 , but they 're trivial and usual to spend around here . 
  well , if you can give an austrian wage to most euro members , i can see it . 
  as is , the 3 of them are used every single day by most portuguese , and their wages are only get smaller . 
  '' those coins are completely unnecessary anywhere in europe , get rid of them . '', 
  portugal begs to differ , they 're used every single day , more and more as wages decrease . 
  because it means no money is safe in any european bank . 
  there are many portuguese , at least , talking about taking their money out of the banks because it will like be taken away as the eu continues to fail to address the real problems and their methods just mean the countries will fail harder . 
  so , now the mafia closes in on france . 
  it 's only a small step to controlling germany and the nordic countries as well . 
  hope you like ever-lowering wages and high unemployment , because that 's what 's best for the economy ... and the new mafia 's pockets , incidentally . 
  good . 
  another push to actually fix things while it 's still possible to have a union . 
  it does , but they 're printing too much money that does n't exist , and everyone else has to pay for it . 
  it 's gone too far beyond the useful for stability and liquidity . 
   people with extremely debilitating diseases should n't be a burden on companies , at most they should be at the care of social security or the nhs . 
   as for the unemployable , that 's a problem for the education system and social care since you 're for massively lowering taxes , where does the money come from ? 
  if they have to pay taxes , they 're going to pay for it one way or the other . 
  but i mostly agree that the state should be the ones to educate them and so on , the problem is that then people from your side are still going to call them bums and cut the programs . 
   the mandatory overtime with little pay would end the moment unemployment went down happened nowhere , ever . 
  that would be a prime reason for unemployment not to go down , btw . 
   as companies would lose much of their bargaining position which has n't happened anywhere either without social protection or on a market with very few qualified people . 
   pensions should be managed much better as the current system is n't sustainable for not even 10 years i hope you 're not talking about private funds , otherwise i 'll point to you how it works in practice in the us : their money gets taken out because businesses need the money elsewhere . 
  but i think the issue is solved here with the increase in retirement age , huge decreases in health care quality and much higher costs . 
   and public transportation should be privatised as we already spend loads of money on it and the private sector provides the same service much more efficiently , not to mention we already spent massive amount of money on the roads . 
  sure they can . 
  just cut whatever offers there are to the profitable ones . 
  you 'll get intercity trains from porto to lisbon , most of the metropolitan routes in porto and lisbon , but with much less availability , and there you go . 
  so much for mobility and only two cities will grow , but it 's profitable . 
  i 'm extremely unconvinced that transportation should be profitable by itself , there 's too much people left out . 
  and privatization usually ends very badly , like the train privatization in the uk . 
  yeah , we built some stupid highways that barely look like highways , but that 's how big business works . 
  but ...  no , it 's nothing like that , if anything these measures would turn us more into the uk or switzerland . 
  we may not be talking about the same measures , i do n't know . 
  but in the uk and the us , they also say they 're too privileged , so i maintain the the end goal ** for them ** , not you , is to turn us into china . 
   the moment the state leaves that business and the companies are left on their own and without taxpayer funding having to compete with the rest of us mortals by the same rules . 
  no politician ever wanted that , so never ? 
  it does n't work , anyway . 
  pharmaceuticals need huge investments from the state . 
  there 's no market incentive to stop global warming . 
  in fact , there 's not even a market incentive for people not to go hungry , so monsanto happens . 
   i do n't know , though we must also not follow greece into that path of defaulting , socrates made the deals , now coelho is paying for it and he ca n't force socrates to cough up the money . 
  he 's gone far beyond the deal and plans to go much further . 
  this ** is ** a default by another name , the contract is impossible to fulfill . 
  no country has ever tried to pay it like this without a war , and there 's a reason for that . 
   because our public schools not always can provide the same service . 
  i did my high school on a private one and it was the state that paid for it because my area of study was n't available in the eb2/3 i was in , and i should tell you , it was a school much better managed than all the public ones i was in . 
  i can believe that . 
  but go watch the tvi report on the gps group about how it 's working these days . 
  public schools are empty because the students are being sent to the private school next door that rejects the students they do n't want . 
  honestly , the fact that they do n't do much better then public schools is pretty damning . 
   you have to control the beneficiaries and you must be able to pay for it without creating a great burden on the rest of society that 's great , as long as we agree that it 's better that some slip through so that others can be helped . 
  there 's a ton of paperwork needed these days that is easy to misfile . 
   let 's look at the cases of success such as the uk , switzerland , finland or austria sadly , i ca n't comment . 
  are n't they in recession too ? 
   not where the businesses we do have are forced to leave or move some place else they leave because they do n't pay taxes elsewhere . 
  paychecks are so minimal that i seriously doubt how a couple of unfirable bad workers , by your view , would even hit the bottom line of major companies . 
   let 's not go down the same path of the cases of failure such as greece , ** venezuela , argentina ** simplifying much ? 
  afaik , they 're growing pretty well after throwing off foreign intervention , even if venezuela 's inflation is mental . 
    the economy grew in a much more stable way when social rights appeared . 
   false , our economy grew when we joined the eu and the restrictions to competition from the estado novo were lifted yeah , we 're an anomaly , i meant after the industrial revolution , the soviet revolution and during the cold war . 
  unsurprisingly , they happened due to fear , because power never cares about the lower classes otherwise . 
   take your socialist rhetoric elsewhere , there 's no 1 % taking all the profits , in portugal what you do have is an environment that kills the competitiveness of any business and inept governments and corrupt politicians that either offer special favours to interest groups right , the banks , brisa , martins dos santos and so on have all bled profusely since 2008 and have n't improved in profits every year . 
  and it 's not like the troika business is just a way of funneling german taxpayers money into their own banks so they do n't get responsibility for the risky deals they made . 
  oh , that 's right , they deal with trillions but had no idea that they were being fooled by greece and just gambled , sorry , invested unwisely . 
  believe what you want , i 've given up hope anything will change until catastrophe strikes in a few months , anyway . 
  a few decades later maybe people will have learned that letting companies do what they want is bad , so a few more rules go up , and the cycle begins again with new loopholes . 
   no , austerity is not that , austerity is cutting excessive public spending , look it up . 
  look it up ? 
  language changes , and that is not the definition that is applied in practice , so i wo n't use it . 
   they 're being used by the government wastefully , let me keep my money and i 'll take great care of it , certainly much better than the guys in the ar . 
  everyone uses it wastefully , mate . 
  the market does not make things efficient by magic , only when there 's strong competition and rights leveling for the case of weak parties . 
  and no , you ca n't always use it better because you 're a much weaker party in negotiations and do n't deal in volume . 
  when americans have a serious disease , there 's not even negotiation , they pay or they die . 
  it 's not even always clear what 's happening until after the fact , like the ridiculous amount of money a degree costs , but for many careers , there 's no choice either . 
  some things can be fixed with laws , others by the state being the primary provider . 
  but if you 're going to go the law route , it has to have teeth , it has to be able to close companies and it has to be able to put people in jail . 
   hollywood and all of that is achieved without any public investment , let people keep their money as that 's what 's necessary hollywood also achieves drm and ridiculous copyright terms , while mostly recycling old shit every year . 
  color me unimpressed . 
  there are things that private companies are just not interested in doing because they are not profitable , but that have an unknowable value for the future . 
  i 'm not a cultural man , so it 's hard for me to say what , but i can point out that without the state interfering there would not be the internet or the many innovations that came from nasa . 
  i think pbs and bbc do a great job that is n't necessarily profitable , and certainly rtp * had * the fairest reporting in the media . 
  of course , imho .
