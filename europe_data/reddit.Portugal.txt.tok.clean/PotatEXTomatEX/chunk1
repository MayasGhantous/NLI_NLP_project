never play japanese mobage then . 
  they 're money sink holes . 
  i know people who spend 10k + monthly on some of them . 
  1k a day keeps the bad stuff away . 
  unfortunately , the number of tourists is ruining the city itself , or so it hear . 
  nice haiku . 
  that ep was kinda ehhh, 
  stop with the jail crap . 
  everyone 's screaming jail when it 's probably the worse option . 
  smh . 
  someone should really add to the dictionary 's definition of prison the word `` incubator '' . 
  ~ ~ hence emy point ~ ~, 
  wait , is n't that joke reserved for the usa ? 
  not to defend / u/bardimir just because of nationality , but he/she did say `` europe '' . 
  no mention of the us . 
  also , i think the intent was to say something along the lines of `` as common place as '' . 
   will become even more flooded by tourists in the near future . 
  let them come ... as long as they bring their $ $ $ $ / $ $ $ $ / ???? 
  wait , what was the previous sentence ... ? 
  hence the `` go south '' expression . 
  i do n't need scientists to tell me that . 
  i just need to check my sunscreen bills . 
  one of the few things i 'm actually proud of my country . 
  same here . 
  same here . 
  hi , can i order a serving of gambas ? 
  it 's possible . 
  i 've seen a few around , i think . 
  to add to this , the libero is the guy/girl that makes sure every hole in the defense is covered and does n't have a `` fixed '' position aside from `` i 'm here to defend '' . 
  well done france and there 's always a next time , brazil . 
  when you can just take a left turn , it 's not that hard . 
   marco is used here , but it 's not * that * common . 
  most names , aside from `` marc '' and `` martina '' are really common in portugal too . 
  if it makes my life easier and i become less prone to die , i 'll be cattle as much as you want . 
  [ edit ] : no idea why people are down voting someone who does n't care if he 's `` seen '' as cattle ( for some reason ) because the government is making sure his health is assured . 
  yup . 
  i always make it to a point to remember that things are n't called the same thing for a reason . 
  d-does she do that a lot ? 
  true enough . 
  if not for the letters , i would never say `` greece '' . 
  wow , this level of mustache game has n't been this high since that other dude from germany . 
  ~ ~ [ edit ] : austria ~ ~ :o, 
  nop . 
  first foreign language was english ( it 's obligatory since 4th grade ) , then french from 7th till 9th grade . 
  i then went with german from 10th grade till 12th grade . 
  but that was my choice . 
  in portugal now you can also choose greek and chinese after your 1st grade , i think . 
   folhado * de * chocolate here , in porto . 
  meanwhile french was my 2nd foreign language ... :|, 
  yeah , lol . 
  speaking of macedonia , the other day portugal was playing against macedonia and all i could think was `` who are we really playing against ... ? '', 
  tbf , i 'm here to read the comments . 
  sometimes i barely read the title at all . 
  just check the quality of the comments with the most upvotes and then check the news/wtc itself . 
  probably not the best tactic , but it 's working just fine for me . 
  found that funny too tbh ... 
  i was like , is n't this against the point you 're trying to make ? 
  this . 
  europa 's a greek word too , i think , so i guess we also have to thank them for that . 
  it does lag behind in some aspects , but most people in the us are quite up there education wise . 
  well , europe = europa in portuguese , so it 's not much of a change to us . 
  greece wins it , i think . 
  portugal 's looks a bit too try hard . 
  just get a god damn toilet booth with an open/closed sign . 
  sup nick ? 
  that 's true ... 
  guess it 's because most of the true rural portugal is more than 200km away . 
  the north of portugal is very active tourism wise , so most know enough english to sell their products/services . 
  alentejo is another story altogether ... 
  i know why portugal 's not there ... dude 's take days to deliver something from one side of the country to the other while stuff i get from japan gets here overnight . 
  look at the edit on my post . 
  it sorta makes sense , in my case at least . 
  i live in porto btw . 
  thanks !, 
  tim does n't know what life is . 
   it 's one of the hardest languages english ? 
  sorry if i missed it but it 's quite late atm ... 
   perpetual transfer payments i would n't say `` perpetual '' ... :|, 
   persuade us to rejoin the point is that it 's whatever . 
  if the uk does n't join , then nothing will change . 
  if it doe , it will only make the eu look better because , as / u/cativellauni said , `` we would merciful '' . 
  alexandrija the smaller . 
  ~ ~ he was small , right ? ~ ~, 
   accusations of cultural appropriation to be a genuine grievance . 
  not saying whether this applies to this situation or not , but cultural appropriation * is * a `` genuine grievance '' . 
  austrelado ps : ovo estrelado means fried egg in portuguese . 
   leave them be that rarely works in any context . 
  let 's see how that works here . 
   hiding their secret identity you ca n't hide something that has a wikipedia page on it ... 
  you would be surprised by the amount of people who write like 2 year olds ... despite the fact that many 2 year olds do n't know how to write . 
   also ... are those eyes or breasts ? 
  i find myself asking that question quite often ... 
  they 're eyes , * for now * . 
  no , it 's with an soft c. like sound of ss in me * ss * . 
  ma-ce-do-nia . 
  the greeks do , apparently . 
  i would be a bit iffy on the subject too , tbh . 
  no idea , but i see you everywhere . 
  mostly on greek-related posts . 
   in transit should be `` in traffic '' .
