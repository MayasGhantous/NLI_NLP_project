strip citizens of their properties to give to migrants and you 've lost tons of voters , leave the migrants out in the cold and you 'll lose tons of other voters . 
  whichever way you cut it they 're in a no-win situation at this point , caused by burrying their heads in the sand the last few months and pretending there is no problem allowing so many migrants to enter the country . 
   what did they expect ??? 
  free houses , free money , free citizenships . 
  because as retarded as our politicians are they still know that going that far would kill their political careers completely . 
  if you believe the left 's narrative these people are supposed to be the answer to our economic problems ... but fail to understand the reality of what you just pointed out . 
  still , you do n't need a degree to haul buckets of cement and dig foundations . 
   apparently it does now ? 
  well i would n't blame denmark if that were the case . 
  these migrants wanted sweden , they can live with their choice . 
  i agree with you there . 
  but this is the shit we have to deal with now , and we 're * not * dealing with it the way we should . 
  we 're still behaving like limp-wristed pushovers . 
   countries should share the refugee load , do n't you think ? 
  perhaps , if there were some fair and coherent policy for accepting them into the eu . 
  germany has pretty much welcomed them all . 
  with the way they 've been allowed to irresponsibly flood in , germany can keep them all . 
  if france wants to share that burden , go ahead . 
   in addition , around 200 refugees who want to return to denmark from sweden are not able to make it , according to data to svt news sk\u00e5ne . 
  now they want to go back after they discover sweden is n't the land of milk and honey they thought it was . 
  nobody saw that coming . 
  - two months ago : [ `` fu denmark , we 're all going to sweden !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kda3o/refugees_marching_through_denmark_towards_sweden/ ) - now : `` denmark , halp ! '', 
  * ] ( https://youtu.be/0d8i8qggz0k?t=7 ), 
   the difference with the other colonies is , that ** they were left to their own devices ** post-colonialism . 
  no , they fought to kick us out . 
  then once gone , they started killing each other in civil wars and running their countries into the ground . 
  so which is it ? 
  stay and be an oppressive colonialist , or leave because they do n't want us there and still get blamed for their problems anyway ? 
  it 's a no-win situation . 
   no idea how that would be ascertained on the border , but the idea is sound . 
  imho a good first filter would be to have women handle the asylum applications , when the applicants are men . 
  if you 're still so backward that you 'll only deal with a man , then you can gtfo right away . 
   there have already been plenty of examples of refugees harassing gay refugees within asylum centers . 
  you wo n't see / u/magadget shed a single tear for them . 
  the refugees need our protection , remember ? 
  `` teh gays '' as he says , will be completely unaffected !, 
  agreed , and reddit is not a representation of the real world . 
  among people i know the reaction varied from `` meh '' , to `` took them long enough '' , to `` fuck yeah '' . 
  i do n't know anyone who shed a single tear for the guy . 
  no , he did n't . 
  what he said was  when bin laden was killed ** all we heard from europeans ** was , `` what a tragedy , murdered without a trail , so much for due process fascist amerikkka ! '', 
  he only mentions that subreddit thread later when he 's scrambling for examples of how europeans supposedly love bin laden . 
  edit : and when you say `` on here '' , that thread is * four years old * , when this sub [ had less than 20k subscribers . 
  ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/europe ) today it has 530k subscribers , but the guy still somehow thinks that thread is * representative of europeans * , let alone this sub today . 
   so a minute ago it was no one had that belief , now it 's just `` some assholes . '', 
  no , i said , and i 'll quote :  nobody , ** nobody i know ** gave two shits if bin laden lived or died , but keep trying to convince yourself of that . 
  --  and now he moves the goalposts to government official reactions . 
  you can admit you 're wrong , it will save you a lot of frustration . 
  i moved the goalposts ? 
  [ * your * comment was that ] ( https://archive.is/jidae ) :  when bin laden was killed all we heard from europeans was , `` what a tragedy , murdered without a trail , so much for due process fascist amerikkka ! '', 
  `` all we heard from europeans '' . 
  `` all we heard from europeans '' . 
  i show you how this is false , and now i 'm moving the goalposts ? 
  `` errrrmageeeerd , some assholes on reddit did n't like osama getting killed , all europeans must share that belief ! '', 
  what a fucking moron . 
  meanwhile , back here in reality , the ** majority ** of european governments reacted in the exact oposite way that you describe : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactions_to_the_death_of_osama_bin_laden#europe but go ahead , keep playing the victim !, 
  tyl what gross generalization is . 
   no i 'm telling you what we heard , for years and still do . 
   `` what a tragedy , murdered without a trail , so much for due process fascist amerikkka ! '', 
  again the infantile american telling us what we supposedly felt . 
  nobody , nobody i know gave two shits if bin laden lived or died , but keep trying to convince yourself of that . 
  and you can keep all of them , and deal with the problems yourselves . 
   the refugee influx will in no way whatsoever affect the lives of `` teh gays '' . 
  burry your head in the sand . 
  i bet you 're the first to crucify conservative christians that hold anti-gay beliefs , but your response to an influx of ultra-conservatives who hold this belief as well is to just ignore it . 
  typical leftist extremist . 
   that 's a far-fetched point to make . 
  what is far-fetched is to what you just did , where you pretend that these terrorists were somehow ethnic europeans . 
  if you ca n't see the direct relationship between previous muslim migrants and their children failing to assimilate into their host society and the current events , then you 're just inviting the same cycle to continue with the current wave of migrants . 
   besides not all of them were muslims according to islam . 
  `` no true scotsman would ever do x ! ... '', 
   for example , ibrahim abdeslam ( the suicide bomber in front of comptoir voltaire , no casualties ) , did n't do anything else than drink alcohol and smoke weed , according to his ex-wife . 
  surprise surprise , bigots and extremists are often guilty of what they supposedly hate . 
  like all those extreme anti-gay american pastors who apparently liked the company of male prostitutes . 
  this changes nothing regarding their motivation for carrying out the attacks , and does n't change that fact that they are dangerous . 
  and what about the others , did they also all smoke weed and drink alcohol ? 
   on another note , as someone who lied about her migration reasons , hirsi ali has a weak spot to say these things . 
  so even if she has valid ideas , and she knows the culture better than you ever will , she should keep her trap shut . 
   you 've got to be kidding . 
  the other parties in france will kill teh gays ? 
  what exactly are the other parties ' policies on dealing with the * fact * that the current wave of migrants are from a culture where gays can face the death penalty , and are openly hated ? 
  your position seems to be to just stick your fingers in your ears and yell `` lalallaa !, 
  racists !, 
  right-wing morons ! '', 
  what exactly is your stance on this ? 
  what do you think should be done to make sure that gays * are * protected from these people ? 
   apparently she did n't get the memo about all terrorist being eu civilians . . all of which are descendents of muslim immigrants , and all of which are muslim themselves . 
  some of which have also been to syria to fight , and returned . 
  perhaps that was her point ? 
   i do n't know what the standard of evidence is for proving criminal nazism . 
  iirc in germany you can be arrested for possessing nazi paraphernalia . 
  by that standard anyone in possession of equivalent islamist items ( flags , etc ) should also face the same sentence , no ? 
  depends on the prison . 
  if it 's sweden 's prisons with all the luxuries of a small apartment , then fuck no . 
  these shits no longer qualify as human beings . 
  i guess when reasonable debate about changing immigration policy is n't a part of the main parties ' agendas then people will start to vote for the parties that promise to address their grievances . 
  why would you wish this on anyone ? 
  no , the article clearly says they 're european nationals !, 
  these people are not a result of failed immigration policies !,
