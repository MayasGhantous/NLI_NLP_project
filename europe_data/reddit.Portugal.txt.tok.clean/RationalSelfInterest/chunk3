   because are problems in a few cities in sweden caused by a small minority , everything else regarding refugees/migrants must be also bad . 
  i do n't have a problem with migrants that are relatively skilled and that integrate easily , and i notice you were careful to lump this new wave of migrants into all the others . 
  you 're extremely naive if you think that the current wave of migrants that come from a society and religion that openly hates homosexuals and jews , has no sense of gender equality is going to integrate easily . 
   or started the war in syria oh dear ... you do have an active imagination if you got that from anything i wrote . 
  but from your tone i 'm quite sure you 're a diplomat or a doctor of the political sciences , so whatever you say is law . 
   statistically you 'd be safer here than pretty much anywhere in portugal . 
   i ca n't remember the last time grenade-tossing gangs were reported in lisbon or porto , our most `` violent '' cities . 
  malmo on the other hand ... 
  but hey if that 's what you think is safety , keep the floodgates open and enjoy the show !, 
   you have no clue whatsoever about either the actions of the german government or the reasons for the current refugee crisis neither does the german government apparently . 
   why exactly do you think you 're qualified to discuss a topic you do n't know the first thing about ? 
  about as qualified as you are , random redditor . 
   i somehow doubt that i 'll evolve into a being of pure thought over that timespan , but if i do and find myself living in your delusions i 'll keep that in mind . 
  the arrogance is strong with this one . 
   at least that question has an easy answer : we do n't . 
  that 's not what 's happening . 
  head burried in the sand i see . 
  from being open to the hordes to doing a 180 wanting to shut the border and bitching about the other countries no wanting to take on the burden you helped create . 
   the actual situation is that democratically elected governments are n't doing what you want them to do , i.e. 
  like a lot of people in here you 're just salty about the fact that you 're not the dictator of europe . 
  if any of the polls about your governments handling of this situation are correct , your democratially elected officials have not done what they were supposed to . 
   that 's for you to come to terms with , not something anyone else gives two shits about . 
  enjoy your sharia ghettos in a few decades , 
   how about more reputable sources like swedish newspapers sure , [ and from the mouth of a police officer  ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ffof.se%2ftidning%2f2015%2f5%2fartikel%2fdarfor-okar-de-kriminella-gangens-makt )  we 're about to lose traction . 
  the last bank moved when someone sent the rockets so that the fire-damaged . 
  the pharmacy was robbed again and again , and they got tired in the end . 
  insurance agency has moved away . 
  the thrown stones at the police , ambulance and firefighters several times a month - ** but there will be no news of stuff anymore . 
  **  the words are police jacob ekstr\u00f6m . 
  he speaks of rinkeby and tensta . 
   if we chase a car so the drive to certain addresses in tensta where a lone police car can not follow suit - because then it will be stoned or riot . 
  ** there are no-go areas . 
  we do not reach there , he continues . 
  ** sure of course the swedish police wo n't admit to not being in control and not being able to enforce the law . 
  news agencies are doing some work exposing other problems related to these migrants , but its tabu : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cfymhqmks8 just keep your head burried in the sand , and like i said , we 'll revisit this issue when some time has passed . 
  for the record , i hope you 're right . 
   if you do not participate that is your thing but on the other hand you wont get financial support from the eu anymore . 
  thing is germany consulted none of the other eu members when it was riding its moral high-horse claiming we could take on hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
  you shat the bed and now stamp your feet when others do n't want to help you clean up ? 
  your solution is therefore to allow the influx into the heart of europe instead ? 
  following the law would be registering the asylum seekers and turning back all of the one 's who 's applications are rejected . 
  this would require having proper funding to patrol the eu border where they are storming in , but aparently germany is happy to spend this money to accomodate them at home instead of setting up detention centers in greece for example . 
  good work . 
   these no-go zones ( which is a misleading term ) are highly exaggerated . 
  if you read the police report ( which is linked in the random blog post you linked ) , you will see that they report difficulties to investigate crime . 
  i did follow sources in that `` random blog post '' , which happens to have multiple articles included that cover the problem . 
  lets [ have a look at one of them ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/02/swedish-police-release-extensive-report-detailing-control-of-55-no-go-zones-by-muslim-criminal-gangs/ ) , shall we ? 
   officers frequently face outright attacks when trying to enter the areas , which is a step up from the previous problem with attacks on mailmen , fire trucks , ambulances and similar services . 
  fire trucks and ambulances had to wait for police escort to enter the areas , but now the police themselves need protection . 
   the gangs try to keep a semi-low profile in many areas so as not to interfere with the `` business '' of dealing drugs , protection rackets and similar illicit activity . 
   ** others seek active confrontation with police ** to establish absolute dominance . 
   a pair of policemen in may were in pursuit of a suspect and unwisely entered the no-go zone of the southern city of landskrona . 
  ** their car was rammed and the officers were forced out of the car . 
  they were cornered by a crowd of some 50 hostile thugs and drew their weapons to hold them back ** and called for immediate backup . 
   several nearby patrol cars responded to the call and sped towards the scene , only to be ordered to stop half a mile away -- just outside the no-go border . 
  ** the police commander did n't send the backup units in , fearing escalation and all-out war . 
  the cornered police officers were left to fend for themselves . 
  ** and you say  are they incidents ? 
  yes . 
  is it sometimes difficult to investigate a crime in this area ? 
  yes . 
  reading what you wrote you 'd think that these `` incidents '' would be something like resisting arrest or perhaps simply being non-cooperative with police , while the reality is that the term `` no-go zone '' fits the situation perfectly . 
  and there are more with similar tone , like the ambulance union chief explaining why they need to be equipped with body armour !, 
  how on earth do you see that and just go `` meh , not really an issue , it 's highly exagerated '' ? 
  you may think this is fine but its not . 
  problem is you wo n't be paying the price for this apathetic behaviour , it will be your grandchildren and further generations . 
  sure , you have a point that there 's not much data yet regarding how many will actually go . 
  though given what they risked to get here i doubt they will very much want to be sent back , especially if germany continues to be politically correct to the extreme . 
  lets revisit this in a couple of years : remindme !, 
  2 years  maybe a new government in sweden ? 
  maybe ? 
  maybe not ? 
  what makes you think sweden will snap out of their insanity any time soon ? 
  sweden is almost a preview of what will happen in germany if this situation continues uncontrolled : http://swedenreport.org/2014/10/29/swedish-police-55-official-no-go-zones/ why not tackle the problem * before * fucking no-go zones start to pop up in your country ? 
  how much violence are you inviting in the future by ignoring the problem now for fear of not being politically correct ? 
  [ this right here  ( http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-fast-tracked-deportations-hit-trouble/a-18809153 )  but we have one principle that stands above all : no deportation at any price . 
  no deportation is worth threatening the health or dignity of the individual . 
  read the rest of the article and you 'll see that that is refering to cases where immigrants simply throw tantrums at the airports and refuse to go . 
  so long as this is the prevailing attitude on forcing them to return , do you really think any of them will ? 
  and if the german government does toughen up whats stopping them from just picking up and heading on to sweden , which will just bend over and open wide for them as usual ? 
   the reason is to seek a place they feel will give them the best future . 
  and this should happen within the law !, 
  with what 's happening now it 's like european countries no longer have any sovereignty because these people have decided they must make their future here . 
  why shouldd we just roll over and let them pour in unrestrained , and let our grandchildren deal with a smouldering powderkeg of a society later on ? 
   poor people in other countries are still part of a social system or social environment in which they can - in principle - develop themselves . 
  really ? 
  how would the people of zimbabwe do this for example ? 
  there exists no real system for them either , and are therefore pouring into south africa and mozambique . 
  should we import the zimbabwean population into europe as well ? 
  i do n't see the people of syria currently illegally entering europe as being any superior to these others . 
  we should help where we can , but there 's also the old saying about not setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm . 
  worst part is she speaks as if she represents all jews or something . 
   ** minorities can not be racist ** because they do not have any power , and therefore do not have the ability to discriminate . 
  apartheid south africa would have been thrilled to hear this !, 
   also , pro multiculturalism is not the same as pro immigration . 
  true , unfortunately in practice there is considerable overlap . 
  the way sweden is aproaching multiculturalism is an example of how not to do it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfe0qaiofmq kind of backfiring now , is n't it ? 
   meanwhile the left in denmark thinks this is a major democratic issue . 
  he is entitled to be an islamist .
