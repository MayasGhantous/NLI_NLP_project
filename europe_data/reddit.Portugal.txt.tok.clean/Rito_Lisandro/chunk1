it is who else it would be im not spoiling i just concluded it is him xd, 
  they even made jesus lol, 
  krijo is fucking a. . women beating the living shit out of each other with there ass and tits . . 
  there are . 
  but not in america : ^, 
  `` lol europe is done . '', 
  sweeden and germany are , and they arent all of europe . . the rest of the countrys in europe or european union dont want immigrants etc, 
  wut . . in the united kingdom they drive on the wrong side of the road . 
  lol, 
  welp i was just about to post this topic, 
  `` you ca n't just make stuff up to win an argument '' im not . . in what way uk leaving the eu negatively effects you ? 
  right nothing . . 
  in this case its not what the dude that quoted `` everyone who opposes my liberal political views is a facist . '', 
  means in literal facist way he is quoting what people usually say if you dont agree with there views ... an example would be : we will open the borders to help people from other nations -- counter argument for that would be : we cant open the borders because we wont have money for a welfare state with the influx of refugees it will drive taxes higher and cause problems ... the counter argument is reasonable and normal but the person that gave the statement to open the boarders dosent see that way and calls it a `` fascist thing to say '' . . that is why the saying is `` everyone who opposes my liberal political views is a facist . '', 
  quot :d really simple, 
  it wont matter to him doe . 
  you just keep posting the facts and lay it out to him till he muted you blocks you or calls you a fascist racist etc -- to prove the point . 
  lol, 
  nothing is currently effecting you ( expect for victimhood complex boredom ) hell even if the article 50 was in effect nothing would happen to you or anyone else . . 
  ok then let me post from the comments from a tread im currently reading its not only insulting trump but everyone that voted for him ... btw just becasue you dont want to see the negatives it dosent mean they are not there . . people are realy comparing him to hitler and calling him xenophobic etc etc. . '' [ -- ] afterberner44 [ score hidden ] 48 minutes ago excuse me !? 
  `` economic anxiety in schools '' ? 
  if by economic anxiety you mean xenophobic , misogynistic sexism , and blatantly racist world views advocating for a systematic elimination of entire vulnerable population groups like latinos , muslims , minorities , poc , breast-feeding mothers , women , people who have donated to cira , la raza , jewish persons , woc , asiatic men and women immigrant advocacy lbgtq civil rights activists people with disabilities who ended up on drumpf 's `` watch list '' of millions of americans and people who were coming to this country for the hope of better life then sure . 
  i guess `` economic anxiety '' is just a label for a whole bunch of right wing hatethought that republicans refuse to address during their stupid rallies where they chant u-s-a !, 
  u-s-a !, 
  u-s-a !, 
  like inside of an autocratic fascist freakshow booth under a tent in breitbardville kentucky creating a giant echo chamber effect in their tiny brains '', 
  what has `` the state '' did to trash your human rights ? 
  o nothing ? 
  then why are you worrying about something that not only is not real and its not happening ? 
  btw the last time i checked we dont live under islamic / sharia law rule . 
  so your rights are still the same . 
  hell what is stopping you from doing what you want right now ? 
  nothing . .

  yap as soon as a counter argument is formed people just tend to shut it down instead of listening, 
  yap that is why i sayd it . 
  its the normal behavior `` everyone who opposes my liberal political views is a facist . '', 
  if you dont agree with a stance you call them fascist . . hell you go on now on politics and you will only see people calling trump hitler/fascist lol, 
  `` i read / r/politics on daily basis , your statement still does n't reflect reality . '', 
  you just proved my point lol, 
  it is https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/, 
  he is a leaf . 
  you can ignore him . 
  his feminist prime minister was in a mosque segregated by gender so he is progressive beyond comprehension of us europeans . . / s, 
  `` printed material currently can be subject to reduced rates or zero rates of vat , but electronic equivalents can not . '', 
  so documents/papers arent taxed , but the rest that is more useful ( technology ) still gona get 30 to 25 % ?? 
  nice guess i still have to wait a few more years till i buy a fucking graphics card again lmao, 
  this is the average take on opposite views these days then they wounder . . `` why didnt i get my way '' . 
  `` nigel farage is an external actor trying to destroy one of europes greatest achievements '' wut ? 
  you dont seem to get the problem eu is causing . . i all up for a union but when you move production from 1 place to another it dosent fix the `` lack if labor for natives '' an example of that is the germans are going to open a factory for automobile parts in portugal . . that is good right ? 
  because it creates jobs etc. 
  now why the fuck didnt they open the factory in germany ? 
  i mean germans need jobs ... and im saying that as im portugese . 
  if you just move the labor from one place to a another to benefit that is abuse . 
  that is what was happening in the uk and in a lot of other eu countrys . 
  what would stop me from portugal going to england in its industrial area and get a job ? 
  nothing . . what would that cause ? 
  one less job for a native and 1 job for a portugese immigrant . .1 less native working or geting money one less vote for the party that made it possible for me to move to england and get that job . 
  its realy simple and farage made it clear and uk people just dont want that to happen to them ... tldr : if eu goes down its not because of him . 
  but how because eu is being run . 
  `` the eu is facing an external threat , i think it should react in an appropriate manner . '', 
  it cant ... the european union dosent control the elections in each single country ( can influence with bullshit propaganda ) in its union and the people are free to chose on the party that they see that caters to them the most . 
  and if that party happens to be one that leads to the leaving of the european union so be it . 
  if eu wants to exist it needs to cater to the people of each country if not then there will be more lefts on the union . 
  `` how many christians were against gay people just 50 years ago ? '', 
  i think this is applied correctly `` two wrongs do n't make a right '' `` has it occurred to you that literacy , access to education , etc. 
  might influence your social values far more than your religion ? 
  or is it just one of the abrahamic religions that , for some magical reasons , is incompatible with a society developed in the other 2 ? '', 
  im an atheist so religions are irrelevant to me and dont influence my morals in any way . . that is why i dont kill people like most islamic countrys with enforcement of sharia law do for being gay , or im nice only because if im not im going to hell ... and yes it is that one relegion is incompatible with western society . 
  did n't like the orlando shooter had access to information and was brought up in western values just to denounce then and killed the gays ? 
  charlie hebdo attackers ware brought up in the western world with information and education and ddint they attacked to based on there islamic values because of insulting there prophet mohamed ???? 
  dosent that mean they ware raised by western values but they renounced then and fallowed the islamic doctrine ? 
  i mean like i sayd you are free to do what ever you like in the west . . even killing gays raping children and woman fallow different religions what ever you like . 
  but like i sayd modern day values of the west dont allow rape or killing of people based on there sexuality etc. . hell if you went on screaming and starting to kill people because of something its in your own right . 
  but just dont get surprised that no one likes you or discriminates against you . . its as almost your trying to justify the killing of gay people raping woman or degrading them lol, 
  you havent . 
  if you are french let me tell you . 
  lepen or what ever that woman is called is going to be the next president and so on and so on and people will wounder why it happen without knowing why it happen . . and no im not justifying lynching no one is . 
  im just stating why this happen ... its like me saying if you put your hand in a fire you will get burned so dont do it . 
  and people still put the fucking hand on the fire and still get burned . . its not justifying its saying what is gona happen if you do something . 
  spain is know for there degeneracy btw i bought batteries pack from a store that is run by islamists just because a few arent causing trouble dosent mean they dont support then ... btw a guy just posted above that 600 million islamist belive in the killing of gay people etc and since you are acting apologetic to there beliefs . 
  then i guess you dont like gay people : s, 
  o your spanish now that explains a lot of the apologetic view of islam ( spain is full of degenerates ) . . but like i sayd its incompatible with the west that is why we are having these problems . 
  le pen will win in the end . 
  '' it 's a fragile political system held together only by the extreme pressure of unites states ' global empire '' da fuck you on about you do know democracy was created way prior to united states . 
  and if anything the united states of america is a treat to the world ( most likely to cause a war ), 
  `` no , it ca n't . 
  it can be said about terrorists and radicals , not about followers of a religion that includes 22 % of the world 's population . 
  equating 1.6 billion people with criminals is xenophobic no matter how you try to frame it . '', 
  islam is and will always be incompatible with the west it dosent matter if you dont see it like that . 
  people that live with and close to it will always vote against it because they know what it is and how it is . 
  `` his daughter would be raped by a criminal . 
  that criminal is to blame . 
  no one else in any of the groups he is a part of is to blame . 
  there is no `` people like that '' , there is a criminal . '', 
  there is . . there was a gang of pakistanis in england that for 20 years ware conducting gang rapes . 
  the attacks in east germany warent made by 1 man but multiple man from middle east so yes we can generalize . 
  `` if he is extending the blame to 2.2 billion people because they share a creed , a country of origin , or a color of skin , then yes , he is . '', 
  there is a saying about red poison berries or something a guy posted on the forum tread `` the man who ate some red berries and got a stomach ache made a generalization and avoided all other red berries . 
  the guy who gave every single red berry a chance did n't survive long enough to reproduce ! '',
