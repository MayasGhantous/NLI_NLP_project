  holy shit , i can buy an extra coffee next year !, 
  they are being led to extinction by an alien species , the portuguese , who has been invading their habitat, 
  not really , just a few areas [ iberia ] ( http://fotos.subefotos.com/064d2ce0c35678efb7c85520f974bd93o.png ) [ uk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/uk_koppen.svg ), 
  misleading , currently the suspects are organized crime organisations related to arms trafficking , not jihadism, 
  who chooses these colours anyway ? 
  so hard to read, 
  it 's wrong , here 's the conversion rate http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?from=eur&amp;to=gbp, 
  you can see where people put their hands on .

  in case anyone 's wondering about portugal not being a part of it , portugal only has one minority language , mirandese , which belongs to the astur-leonese branch of west-iberian romance languages ( portuguese belongs to the boringly named galician-portuguese branch ) . 
  it has co-official status in the country and is protected and promoted locally . 
  the language is spoken only by ~ 5000-10000 people in the far ne of the country , but most people know it exists, 
  because in the 19th century it was said that kids with down syndrome had physical similarities to people of the `` mongolian race '' ( aka people from east asia ), 
  `` gay version of our cunt 's flag '' sounds . . well . . 
   nationalities of the inmigrants ( romania , ** morocco ** , venezuela , colombia and italy ) are ** close to us in terms of culture ** * triggered * deus vult !, 
  [ it ] ( http://touchcoins.moneymuseum.com/coins_media/1372/reverse.png ) 's the royal seal of 1144 . 
  the castles and the shields around the edge are symbols in our flag also since the middle ages , and they mimic the eu flag 's stars, 
  [ it does seem ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/aqueduct_segovia_2_2012.jpg ) [ that you 're right ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/acueducto_segovia_noche.jpg ), 
  not at all , the keystone ( the one at the very top ) works just like any other , it 's being compressed by those on either side that prevent it from falling . 
  you can have even more slender and flat examples without mortar https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mnwslxscllo/maxresdefault.jpg / u/leteceovce linked a nice example of how it 's made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdg-6_xheeo, 
  the stones in an arch are compressed , so they remain in place even without mortar because the stones are compressed against each other , and the friction is enough to keep them put without sliding off . 
  friction is proportional to the normal strenght between two surfaces - thus higher if the two are compressed against each other - and a coeficient that depends on the materials/texture of the surfaces ( the smoother it is , the lower it is , so friction is also lower ), 
  * cries in trumpese *, 
  it 's better than the guy 's previous video on iberia ( which was poor ) , but there are still some mistakes in dates and important omissions , particularly in the earlier periods in which things seem to change hands willy-nilly over vast swathes of land . 
  there are some good details , such as sintra + lisbon being owned by the christians in the mid 1090s . 
  and olivenza , that 's a bad one . 
  so , what does the creationist theory in islam say about this ? 
  make the most serene republic great again, 
  maybe he can start with himself , he does n't seem like a useful person for our society anyway, 
  good job keeping them out , spain by the way , the article refers to it as ` refugee crisis ' but a significant part of them are simply migrants ( ib4 ` moroccan syrian refugee ' jokes ) . 
  stop shoving the refugee label onto anyone arriving in europe just because they are impoverished and from abroad, 
  maybe the pesto was so good it was to die for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  do you realise how expensive that would be ? 
  besides , there 's exercise red flag where multiple countries can participate, 
  yep , they do . 
  but red + green is worse , and potentially harder to distinguish though , for people with deuternopia or protanopia . 
  ask colourblind people , they 'll tell you what a potential nightmare that combination is . 
  green + blue is horrible aswell, 
   vexillology it 's the study of flags : vexillum ( flag ) + - logia ( study ) . 
  rules for the creation of banners and flags have existed for centuries , so they are visible , clear and without colour clashing . 
  the most basic rule of tincture is `` metal should not be put on metal , nor colour on colour '' . 
  green and red are both on the ` colour ' group , so the rule is broken and the flag visibility rather poor . 
  italy and ireland are smarter than us , and have a ` metal ' ( white ) stripe separating them . 
  consequence : we get a flag that has great potential , but its colours are complete shit . 
  white and blue do not break the rules , which is why they are so much more pleasant on the eye . 
  besides most humans tend to associate blue with positive things ( besides being the most common favourite colour ) , and red with more negative ones, 
  the floor is lava, 
  irrelevant . 
  by law , under some exceptions due to history or recent events/changes , vilas are required to have 3000 voters , so a population considerably higher than what you said . 
  not true , algueir\u00e3o-mem martins has a population of over 60k and it 's considered a vila . 
  sintra is a vila aswell, 
  technically it 's the red and green that 's the republican colours ( since before the republic existed ) . 
  historically our national colours have always been white and blue . 
  besides , red and green being together breaks the vexillology rules , no wonder the colours are horrible when put together, 
  how on earth would that be trolling remainers instead of brexiters ? 
  seems like wishful thinking only, 
  maybe in a couple of years they 'll think it 's a good idea to steal sparsely-inhabited land from a random eu state and give these people their own country . 
  it could be named mourolandia/morolandia , sarracenia or mahometania . 
  it will be glorious / s, 
  anyone above us is a sissy liberal , and anyone below us is an outdated fool, 
  new study ... 4 years ago, 
  it 's the same for spanish and portuguese ( although we use an acute accent above the first ` a ' ), 
  yeah , alberto too . 
  personal names like those , aloisio , albano , etc are never from arabic . 
  toponyms generally are , but not always ( alentejo , alenquer ), 
  i like macron ( and i 'd vote for him if i were french ) , but this does n't seem like a healthy result for a working democracy at all, 
  `` catalan 's dream of autonomy '' ? 
  catalonia has been autonomous since 1979 . 
  you got the uk flag in france upside down, 
  alfonso is of germanic ( gothic ) origin though . 
  not everything started with al - is from arabic, 
  we do the same with ` peru ' . 
  that 's right , peruvians , we eat you during christmas, 
  fuck me sideways and call me skippy , that 's a massive win, 
  it 's indeed greek , but the reason this is noticable is not because of its location , but rather the architecture . 
  greek temples have stairs all around the building , roman ones do not , they only have stairs on the front facade which is where most emphasis was given . 
  they are also more decorated on the front than on the rest of the perimeter . 
  aditionally , roman temples tend to have a high pedestal beneath them , greeks ' did not, 
  the other guy is right , always use sunscreen , [ or ask someone to put it for you ] ( https://youtu.be/cs5mit1eqrk?t=37 ),

  i swear i first read it as ' [ hassen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hassan ) ' . 
  the irony, 
  20c for a bath seems rather cheap, 
  not if you go to sevilla it is n't , they have a record of 47\u00bac . 
  do not visit it during summer like i did, 
  someone skipped history classes, 
  those spanish patronymic surnames are actually more common in ( north ) western spain than in the east , which is why they are also so common in portugal - they date back to naming traditions during the kingdom of le\u00f3n , of which we were a part of . 
  i have one of those , rodrigues , which is also the most common in galicia ( spelled rodr\u00edguez ) http://www.ine.es/apellidos/formgeneralresult.do?vista=1, 
  that caf\u00e9 dates back to late [ 1800s ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=casa+pereira+da+concei%c3%a7%c3%a3o&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidu7_wqpfuahwgwxokhsqgdw4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#imgrc=_ ) . 
  different times, 
  same in portugal , it 's related to `` santiago mata-mouros '' , aka saint james, 
  not like catalonia has the resources to rebel either anyway, 
  spain consumes more beer than wine , though ( twice as much ) . 
  oh , our degenerate brothers , how thou hath fallen ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ jk , beer  wine_imo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita, 
  would n't you agree that ` white ' is an outdated term that has little to no meaning ? 
  the fact that you are asking this kind of proves how dubious the label itself is . 
  it might have made sense 500 years ago , when western europeans set out to colonise other territories ( ie : a guy named `` jos\u00e9 garcia '' could have been portuguese/spanish , a converted native american or an african slave , so the label helped clarifying it ) , but it has no place in modern times with all we know about genetics and so on . 
  europe itself has somewhat arbitrary borders , so i suppose you 're free to consider them european or not , depending on how you see things .
