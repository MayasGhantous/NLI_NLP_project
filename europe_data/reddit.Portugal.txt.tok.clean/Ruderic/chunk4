  if you are going by culture ( which , in practice , is much more relevant than genetics are ) you might say `` no '' . 
  on the other hand , if you give importance to the impact the country had on europe , your answer might be `` yes '' . 
  personally i do n't think the question matters very much , but that 's just me, 
  regarding the last one , here 's what the labels mean . 
  chronological order : hg - hunter gatherer chg - caucasus hg whg - western ( european ) hg ehg - eastern ( european ) hg shg - scandinavian hg n - neolithic en - early neolithic mn/chl - middle neolithic/chalcolithic ( copper age ) lnba - late neolithic/bronze age emba - early middle bronze age mlba - middle late bronze age ia - iron age, 
  here are three better ones , without silly labels like `` blackness '' or `` yellowness '' . 
  taken from more recent studies [ larger one , easier to see ] ( http://pichoster.net/images/2014/02/13/eurasia%20pca.png ) [ from lazaridis 2016 , one of the most important papers on the subject ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6f9849i.png ) [ same as above , but with ancient west eurasian populations ] ( https://s32.postimg.org/qi9jt7u0z/wykres_pca.png ), 
  because association between haplogroups and languages/ethnicities is only tenuous . 
  the reason r1b is considered ` celto-italic ' or ` germanic ' is because it peaks in frequency in regions where these languages were/are spoken . 
  i2 was basically from `` western european '' hunter-gatherers who eventually mixed with incoming anatolian farmers thousands of years ago . 
  you could be swedish and have ydna e1b that it would n't make you any less swedish than the guy standing next to you . 
  autosomal dna is what actually defines genetic structure , haplogroups only give us an idea of populational migrations throughout the millenia, 
  or , you know , limited manpower . 
  much like other guys a century earlier, 
  `` man '', 
  how awesome would it be to enjoy a sunny beach with pristine fine sand , the fresh ocean breeze , and the sight of oil rigs, 
  what about the sons of exo-lisboan migrants living in lisbon , should they be kicked out aswell ? 
  ( pls no ), 
  we 'd sooner kick turkey out of nato and let austria in ( if they wanted to join ), 
  ` cogombro ' ( like in galicia ) also exists in portuguese , although it 's pretty outdated and no one really uses it, 
  regardless , everything points to anatomically modern humans having developed in africa . 
  some ancestor a gazillion years ago having lived elsewhere matters very little . 
  we were also unicellular organisms once, 
  [ portokal , karalho ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5278df0469bedd437741ccc2-1024-837/ngljvich.jpg ), 
  ninety : nine + - ty nine , from old english ` ni\u0121on ' , from proto-germanic ' * newun ' - ty , from old english ' - ti\u0121 ' ( `` - ty '' ) , from proto-germanic ' * tigiwiz ' . 
  related to ` ten ' so he 's right , ' 90 ' is germanic , we just use arabic numerals to express it quickly . 
  your argument is like saying all words are latin because we use the latin alphabet, 
  r1a in slavs and indians are not of the same branch , though http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_r1a_y-dna.shtml but as you said obviously no ydna belongs to any specific peoples . 
  as far as i know i am i1 , but portuguese born and bred, 
  andorra is in blank , but you 're right , they are obviously part of our tribe . 
  r1b peoples of europe , unite !, 
  i think you forgot someone, 
  nowhere did i make such statement , but maybe you 'd like to enlighten everyone on how politics work , since you seem to know / s, 
  how about having half of the government being dumb ? 
  because 50 % of the population is under average intelligence, 
  i do n't care whether a government ( macron 's or anyone else 's ) has gender parity in its cabinet , all i actually hope is that the best people are chosen , regardless of having a wiener or not . 
  for me this is what equality should be like, 
  that 's right , bmw , like the rest of the civilised world ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i_actually_drive_a_vw, 
  he did refer to ` existing debt ' , not future one . 
  i do recall an enterview given to our state television in which he supported mutualising future debt in the euro zone , while rejecting do it for current debt . 
  no idea if he still defends that or not , as i 've never heard him talk about the subject since, 
  they do n't , i have been to spain over 20 times and my experience has been the total opposite of what you said, 
  it was , they just decided to wear a benfica jersey for some random reason ^ ^ ^ clearly ^ not ^ a ^ benfica ^ fan, 
  italy is such a beautiful country , ca n't wait to visit it again !, 
  oh boy , that would really rustle some jimmies, 
  [ they should n't ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/british_isles_terms.gif/300px-british_isles_terms.gif ) , as it 's a geographical term . 
  british isles and british islands are two different things . 
  up to 1600s , or thereabouts , portugal was also considered a part of ` spain ' ( peninsula ) , indeed our greatest national epic refers to the portuguese as ` peoples of spain '  \u0168a gente fort\u00edssima de espanha, 
  british isles includes the island of ireland , great britain , isle of man , etc. 
  great britain is the island which includes england , wales and scotland, 
  i had no idea cities could also be bipolar . 
  glad we 're not alone on this one, 
  ignoring the stupid provocation , [ it 's mostly because we actually do something about it ] ( http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/sites/default/files/filemanager/eu-renewables-map.png ), 
  [ we have other means , and our co2 emissions are n't that bad anyway ] ( https://www.google.pt/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;idim=country:prt:esp:ita&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:prt:esp:ita:grc:ado&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=484527600000&amp;tend=1368140400000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  i do n't know , maybe it 's a frying pan / s, 
  how hazardous would a nega nord + * someone else * coalition be for italian unity ? 
  i mean , is n't ln trying to promote a federalised italy ( or worse , a split between north and the rest of the country ) ? 
  assuming they 'd win the election , that is, 
  triggered ? 
  you must be projecting , i kinda wanted sources , and it gave none . 
  it 's just rubbish, 
   first , the leaders of major financial , industrial and commercial groups , as well as eminent advisers to the government , chose the future president of the republic -- in this case , emmanuel macron -- and instructed him on his mission . 
  then these oligarchs mobilized the state , the government , the law , the media , communicators , artists , freelancers , pollsters , bookmakers and civil society leaders to carry him to the highest office in the land . 
  stopped reading right here . 
  no sources , no links , no evidence , no nothing . 
  just an unfounded conspiracy theory and building an argument around it . 
  reading this `` article '' is a waste of time, 
  he is also a cannibal for sure / s, 
  outdated map with some mistakes , such as considering basques/aquitanians as celts , which they very clearly were n't as they did n't even speak an indo-european language, 
  well , at least we beat italy ( or got beaten , it depends on how you look at it ) . 
  just, 
  well * kalimera * there , sunshine, 
  fair enough, 
  ` indebted ' seems like an overstatement , portugal did have people on their side . 
  spain/castile historically did really badly when invading these parts , particularly when there was popular support on the defense, 
  i sport a nice slight tan already , eventhough i 'm not one to tan much . 
  but wish it did n't get hotter than this , it can get a bit torrid down here at times, 
  i wonder , how do catalan independentists view the guy on the western edge of the peninsula , portugal ? 
  irrelevant , probably we all are . 
  we have 2 ^ n ancestors in each generation ( around 25 years ) , assuming no inbreeding - which we all are to a small degree - just do a little maths and see how many ancestors you had in the 600s . 
  this is just meant to annoy * le penese * people, 
  i have seen them around arroios/alameda and so on , no need to go all the way to chelas and such . 
  just do n't get too close to ist , or prices will spike . 
  lisbon is expensive , but not $ 900-expensive , unless you move to more central/fancy areas ( lapa , etc ), 
  portugal is now below france . 
  i rarely go to the beach , but when i do i generally stick to the ones on the south bank of the tagus , anyway , so it 's fine with me . 
  not actually terrible for iberia , when compared to the rest of the continent . 
  except for the basques , sorry , lads . 
  ps : galicia and portugal , caralho, 
  a `` dna map '' with sardinia , northern and southern italy together , or greeks with slovenians ? 
  right . 
  here 's what an actual `` dna map '' looks like : http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7518/images/nature13673-f2.jpg https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1430/60/1430603811108.png, 
  yeah , let 's bomb and invade bullfighting arenas . 
  maybe we 'll also find oil under the sand, 
   pyongyang great . 
  just great . 
  it ai n't over till the fat lady sings, 
  pardon my ignorance , but who made this decision ? 
  greece should have done the same thing turkey did to the russian aircraft back in late 2015, 
  i 'm surprised an italian does n't realise what the map colours are about https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/habsburg_dominions_1700.png/300px-habsburg_dominions_1700.png,
