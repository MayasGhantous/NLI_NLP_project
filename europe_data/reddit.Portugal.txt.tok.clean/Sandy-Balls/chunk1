i think the main problem is that you have to pay them . 
  please for the love of god stop calling it oporto , you are saying theporto . 
  foreigners probably call it oporto because we use the before porto very often and we machine gun the name , but please do n't massacre our beloved northern capital name . 
  just to complete the info , portugal is named after it 's ix century capital [ `` portus cale '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portus_cale ) . 
  it was pronounced portus ** g ** ale , the name was then abbreviated to portucale after the city of gale fled to the north due to the moors and then it was abbreviated from portugale ( the pronunciation ) to -  portugal . 
  you already stole us the part of lusitania and now you want to steal our lusitan heroes too ? 
  ( no harm intendead just kidding , please do n't invade us ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ fail ^ ^ ^ again ^ ^ ^ xd ) for those who do n't know i 'll try to explain in my broken english . 
  portugal was formed by a man who is considered one of the greatest portuguese hero ( comes into topic ) his name was [ d. afonso henriques ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) . 
  d. afonso was a warrior king that conquered [ pretty much what portugal is today ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v3wkolp.png ) , he wanted to conquer area that was [ lusitania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/lusitania.png ) , even thou it was against the treaties signed . 
  in 1169 d. afonso henriques moved from the city of \u00c9vora against badajoz successfully sieging the city , however when the portuguese were already beating up the moors in the streets the troops of the kingdom of leon surrounded the city and captured our wounded king . 
  in exchange foor the kings liberty they demanded the renouncing of the claims over those lands , give back the galician city of tui , give 20 war horses and pay 3000 kg of gold . 
  and that my firends is why the is a bit of lusitania that is n't in portugal , including the old lusitan capital , merida . 
  i hope i did n't bored you , i get a bit exited with history , and writing is n't my strenght so i 'm sorry for the layout . 
  for my portuguese friends here is the only extensive article i found about it , it shames a bit our king this episode so it is n't taught in schools . 
  `` serbia is one of the most tolerant countries in the world because they killed all the intolerant ones '' - frankie boyle edit : accidental a letter . 
  after half an hour of search here is the [ source of the quote . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/uhkayej-mmu?t=13m54s ), 
  do n't forget we were [ fighting on 4 fronts during the revolution . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch%e2%80%93portuguese_war ), 
   they are independent thanks to us ( spain could n't fight two wars at once , west and east , and concentrated fighting us ) that is a bit biased . 
  your revolution only gave us time to regroup and organize . 
  the spanish did n't forgot us , after defeating your rebellion they came after us and the beating and humiliation of the spanish invaders like [ these one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_lines_of_elvas ) or [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ameixial ) ( although not so fantastic ) were done without help . 
  1/5th of the population in luxembourg is portuguese ... do n't know those that are luxembourgs but are of portuguese descent . 
  that is due to during the colonial war the famine ( the american led sanctions only affected the people ) and mass conscription , during those 13 years of war a 10 million people country was able to deploy 1,5 million man . 
  during that period 1,250 million people immigrated from portugal . 
  one of the countries that welcomed portugal was luxembourg , they were blooming and needed urgently man power so they offered shelter and manual works for the portuguese . 
  no matter how smart you were you could only be able to get manual jobs because more `` serious '' jobs required a full luxembourg nationality . 
  the portuguese are very present in the constructions business in luxembourg accounting for 95 % of the man power involved in the manual work, 
  we called our colonies there brazil , just like the 13 american colonies . 
  brazil is a federation of states like the us . 
  also we conquered spanish uruguay in 1816 . 
  in retaliation the spanish suspended any conversation of returning oliven\u00e7a violating the treaty signed by the defeated countries of the napoleonic wars . 
  brazil declared independence in 1822 . 
  we lost oliven\u00e7a due to the crown wanted to expand brazil and that lasted 8 years . 
  thanks a lot . 
   400 billion eur , but the government took the initiative to cut 850 billion . 
  we have a gdp of 170 billion euros ... 
  most people that are not fluent in english will read the silent k , resulting in in the quenaife . 
  ( imagine a spanish q and then nife ) . 
  well , there are still lots of places where it 's the natives that fill the arenas . 
  every time a bullfight comes to my city the tickets disappear , it is rare to hear someone saying touradas should be abolished , we already abolished the killing of the bull in 1836 !, 
  now if you say that it is not a nice way to treat an animal it is n't , but is is way better then the beef you eat everyday . 
  bulls are raised in big fields and have many partners to mate to continue their lineage , after 5-6 years of `` good life '' they go into the arena and are [ hit in the back where it does n't hurt as much . ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/bullfight%2c_portugal.jpg ) . 
  for those saying bullfighters have no balls because they are not at the same level of the animal in portugal there is actually a tradition where `` forcados '' face the bull and [ grab him by the head in a stand off . 
  ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/-z8ny8pgwojq/tzzrwjgw1wi/aaaaaaaab4m/p9z14lcbjgi/s1600/almeirim%2b3-4-11%2b047.jpg ) also the bullfights are responsible by the creation and preservation of several races . 
  the most widely known are the pure blooded lusitan horse , the oldest saddle horse race in the world with 5000 years , it is commonly used for equestrian ends and as a bullfight horse due to his courage . 
  the creation of the [ brave bull race ] ( http://c1.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b9a09d71d/11482700_dnbaz.jpeg ) it is also linked to the bullfights . 
  i know i am getting a lot of criticism for defend this tradition but every angle must to studied before you jump into a conclusion , those who oppose bullfights but eat anything from animals are hypocrites . 
  also please tell me that `` puta '' is n't woman . 
  well , i 'll leave you the challenge of the word `` saudade '' .

  everything is wrong with this . 
  even the mural is not correctly translated in order to diver more shock and drama . 
  it reads minimum wage 475 $ not medium . 
  first the minimum wage is 485 $ , way to get your facts right reuters ( source ) . 
  second the medium wage is about 950 $ , nothing like that . 
  second point , social unrest ? 
  where ? 
  besides the left block rallies and constant manifestation to create instability i do n't see social unrest . 
  the only critics i 've heard is that the constitution tribunal preferred to give back the vacations subside to the public workers at the exchange of cutting in education and health . 
  but what boils my blood is hat the motion has a 100 % rate of being rejected b the majority ( social democrats and christian democrats ) and it is going to consume plenty of time and human resources . 
  we could be using them to solve the crises instead of the constants motions to overthrown the government that the socialist party , the communist party and the left block are constantly making . 
  it 's in the 4th in 2 years already . 
  edit : never mind , it was rejected , like it was expected . 
  and guess what , [ it is coming back . ] ( http://www.atelevisao.com/sic/sic-transmite-nova-serie-de-rex-o-cao-policia/ ) . 
  edit : it was quite a hit when it aired ( 1999 ) and the years that followed ( i remember it was still airing in summers 2005 ) . 
  it was such a hit that the rival private television to the one that owned rex 's right 's made a portuguese version called inspector max . 
  i am a northern and i do n't know an almeida either , guess it 's a morish name . 
  everything that starts with al in portuguese is of moorish descent . 
  so maybe we need to cross the [ mondego ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondego_river ) into the desert to start to find almeidas . 
  and here i mumble of these arctic temperatures of 13\u00bac with a bit of clouds . . you poor bastards must have sad lives . 
  compared to the [ mugs that i see them ] ( http://www.internationalreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/starbucks.india_.cafe_.jpg ) take in the movies yes it is . 
  we will call it shortish , we also have [ real short coffees ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/_iyhzdzzns-i/s12zjriafri/aaaaaaaabtk/pwrylmzq2fq/s400/foto+0162.jpg ) , it just comparing to what i see the other one is short . 
  in portugal we drink our coffees short and strong , [ like a real coffee ] ( http://www.distribuicaohoje.com/resourcesuser/icm_ifedistribuicaohoje_stg/imagensnoticias/delta_cafe.jpg ) . 
  it baffles me how the americans call a litre of barley hot water a `` coffee '' . 
  yes they emigrated in the beginning of the xx century along with the portuguese . 
  portugal lost in 20 years ( 1890 to 1914 ) 1/5th of it 's population due to political instability and poverty ( thanks a lot [ british ultimatum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ) , we love you ) , and along with them the galicians rode to brazil . 
  also after the fall of franco there was an emigration wave due to the poverty in galicia again , it was not until the galicians threaten to join portugal that the spanish government started investing there . 
  galician is practically the same as portuguese . 
  saying it 's equal to spanish it 's like saying french and italian are the same . 
  let me rephrase then . 
  if galician has nothing to do with castillan then why it 's in the same `` area '', 
  galicians write queixo but say it like us queijo . 
  well they are n't even in the map , not like there are millions of galicians or something . 
  and now most of the subreddit goes `` huh ? 
  you do n't speak spanish ? '' . 
  no we do n't , for example the spanish say * estados unidos * and we say * estados unidos * ... oh wait bad example . 
  edit : added a few words for clarity . 
  most of those people in my country that lack secondary education are still a fallout of the dictatorship where people would normally only complete basic education . 
  after the fall of the regime they changed the minimum to 9nd grade and now the minimum is 12th grade . 
  also as said most of the unemployed are educated persons with a diploma because the high education jobs are saturated . 
  on the other hand there are areas in my country where uneducated people get easily a job due to low standards ( they take minimum wage and work in a skill job , something that persons with a diploma ** refuse ** to do ) . 
  it is the official soundtrack of every communist rally . 
  they are still stuck in 1975 , they were so close to installing [ a communist government . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup_of_25_november_1975 ) fortunately we would have ` murica help freeing the shit out of us . 
  just kidding they would [ invade azores ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/11/19/us-plans-azores-1975/ ) to prevent it to fall to the ussr and leave us to die . 
  but lets give america some credit , they wanted to spread freedom so much that they were going to force a independence of azores ( in order for them to install a government that would give them the [ lajes base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) ) .
