  this was the music that initiated the coup that brought democracy back to portugal . 
  they are pretty much pictured [ like this . 
  ] ( http://conversadatreta.com/wp-content/woo_uploads/73-alentejanos_preguicosos.jpg ) a few jokes just to explain : why do alentejanos read the newspapers in corners ? 
  so the wind can change their pages . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------- where university is the best university in the world ? 
  it 's in \u00c9vora ( capital of alentejo ) because there they enter alentejanos and get out engineers . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ what do alentejanos do at the end of the work day . 
  they take their hands of their pockets . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------- why do alentejanos get up early ? 
  so they can be more time doing nothing . 
  edit : how did i forgot to write university ? 
  in europe . 
  i was talking abut inquisition autos de f\u00e9 in the iberian peninsula where there is the tradition of bullfights . 
  there were only about 800 executions over the course of 200 years , even the portuguese inquisition had a higher execution rate than the spanish inquisition . 
  on the other side there have been hundreds of thousands of bullfights over the years , it 's deep into the iberian culture . 
  you know you are in a heavily catholic country when all the news programs have the same opening new and talk about it for 20 minutes . 
  all of them . 
  you normaly round it up from 78.75 $ to 80 $ , that is the maximum we will tip . 
  anything more than 5 $ is very very generous . 
  [ better resolution ] ( http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/us_germany_spain/pvmap_usgermanyspain%20poster-01.jpg ), 
  germany is the lead solar producer and has a solar capacity equal to alaska . 
  this came to debate after a [ fox news expert \\ [ * \\ ] claimed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jjn0b2riimi ) solar in germany is more profitable because is more sunny in germany than in the us . 
  ^ [ * ] ^ the ^ expert ^ is ^ an ^ expert ^ in ^ areas ^ that ^ benefit ^ from ^ a ^ failed ^ solar ^ policy , ^ namely , ^ natural ^ gas ^ and ^ fussel ^ fuels . 
  you must be alentejano for being so offended . 
  i though the hiperbole was enough of a sign that i was joking . 
  i only meant that alentejo is hot , i did n't say any of the steoriotypes of people from alentejo . 
  edit : typo in hot,

  it 's ideal , it has an average temperature of 45c\u00ba in the winter at night and while in a shadow . 
  portugal and spain could almost feed the entire eu . 
  something like that happened in portugal a few weeks ago , the bananas were for sale on a major supermarket in portugal , in the bottom of the baskets there 118kg of cocaine . 
  i just do n't want to be the person that shipped the wrong bananas ... [ source in google translate .

  may i ask where does the surplus goes ? 
  it is all invested in castilla ? 
  that is the point , sane word and pronunciation , different meanings . 
  the pronunciation is all the same except in the first one , i guess i was looking for inspiration and slacked off . 
  i 'm not saying portuguese is the most difficult language in the world , it 's just the one i can say for experience that is more complicated than english . 
  this is all because americans normally have the tendency to say that everything about them is superior than the rest of the world , no need of a phd to know that . 
  also danish is hardest in my opinion . 
  kamelasa . 
  this are just a few that just came to my mind . 
  please let me know if you want to know more . 
  in portuguese we have a thing that english lacks . 
  a general use of feminine . 
  almost all verbs , nouns , etc , have a feminine version while in english is masculine only . 
  there is also a lack of plurals but in a lesser degree . 
  the statistics that show a exponential growth of the number of words is due to new science terms and the new technology revolution that has as a banner language the english . 
  admit it , english is very easy compared to the other languages , stop trying to make every aspect of your culture superior to the rest of the world . 
  thanks , i am not going to change it , since i would be cheating that way , but i have taken a note . 
  we have 12 vowel sounds , english ( and spanish ) have only 5 , so i would n't bet that pronunciation is easier . 
  ( that explains [ this misinterpretation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xchd9br7viy ) of what mourinho said , you , spanish , missed by a landslide . ), 
  edit : assumed you were spanish . 
  we , the new generation , all beat the statistic and we 're among the eu averages . 
  the reason why the average is so short is due to the famine in portugal during the dictatorship , in the [ colonial war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) goods were ratiocinated . 
  it was the time of one sardine for 3 , children got out of the primary schools to work on the fields . 
  it was all only 40 years ago . 
  could you please point out the mistake so i can enrich my grammar/syntactic constructions of phrases . 
  i might have a lot of ground to cover in english , but do n't tell me it 's hard . 
  every language has those kind of sentences , if you knew portuguese i would show you about 10 right from the tip of my tongue . 
  edit : i remembered the name of that kind of words , it 's the homonymous words i think . 
  the point is , every language with a grammar has those , it 's not only english . 
  did you just said english is hard ? 
  edit : you 're obviously british , english is one of the easiest languages around , only matched in easiness by esperanto . 
  an example , in portuguese we have about 100 verbal tenses for our equivalents of the verb to be , while in english is under 10 . 
  that is n't portugal it 's the [ kingdom of the suevi . 
  ] ( http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~klio/maps/re/a451eu.gif ) sir you missed a few thousands of years , 1500 to be more accurate . 
  oh god , what have you done ... 
  is portugal the only country with only one house ? 
  how so is that they are worth too much , we would almost exclusive use these coins and the 20 $ note . 
  to put in perceptive portugal ca n't print more than 100 $ notes , we are n't that rich . 
  portugal fought three at the same time for 13 years with a sixth of manpower 1/50th of the resources while being embargoed by 99 % of the nato ( portugal did n't have rockets or missiles giving us a huge disadvantage ) and we fought three guerrillas that were supplied military by the ussr and financially/politically by the us . 
  it was portugal versus the world , our only allies were apartheid south africa due to the fear of an epidemic of black power . 
  we sent 1,5 million persons to war over the period of 13 years , that 15 % of out population , about 30 % of our male population . 
  besides we lost our baby boomers to emigration and hunger due to the rationalization of resources , it was the time of the 1 sardine for three people ... [ here for the curious the article . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) so when you ( americans , you poles have quite an historic of suffering , the americans are the ones that are `` spoiled little kids '' ) say vietnam was bad , you do n't now what we went through . 
  well i do n't know about your country but in my country people usually put the well being of their sons above any shame it might create giving them shelter while they build their lives . 
  some are wrong . 
  gibraltar is named after the muslim general that crossed the strait into the iberian peninsula . 
  i do n't see which azorian island is name holy farmer , pico means peak ( the islands holds the hight point in portugal ) and st.miguel is the archangel . 
  now the city of porto comes from portucale ( the name that was named to the kingdom , the word later evolved to portugal ) , and it is possible that `` cale '' comes from the greek `` beautiful '' or `` warm '' therefore it 's beautifu/warm port or just the port of the city cale , that was a the city of current [ vila nova de gaia . 
  oh god , google ca n't translate a damn phrase without taking most of the meaning out of it . 
  but it at least has evolved now it translates expressions to other expressions and not word by word . 
  ( ex : `` vamos por partes '' ( let 's go by steps ) translated to `` first things first '' ), 
  and for those who doubted algarve was a british colony under disguise , look again . 
  also , requiem in pace galician . 
  welcome to the club . 
  in portugal it is not * de jure * decriminalization but a * de facto * . 
  prosecutors are told to completely ignore any case of piracy for non-commercial use , as they were flooding our system , fault of our riaa that submitted thousands of processes of people they fished with honeypots etc. 
  now any case of non-comercial piracy just gets shelved . 
  then it must be because i am from the north , it has hundreds ( literally ) of different words and expressions from you moors of the south . 
  edit : just read it with an accent from the north and it will make much more sense . 
  the portuguese woman must be like the sardines , small and good ( this word has the same connotation as `` hot '' in the english language ) . 
  yes . 
  now you know how we feel about english names of products , we do n't know what they mean , only how they sound , even thought most of the times the meaning is something banal , we feel like it is poetry in a name . 
  oh , here in portugal we have quite some examplares in the [ pal\u00e1cio nacional de mafra . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pal%c3%a1cio_nacional_de_mafra ) the basilica has 6 big ass pipe organs , [ here is a pic where 3 are showing . ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/_ct35z3kptmm/s_r1nggwggi/aaaaaaaaepg/q2vnhqxenzu/s1600/mafra-orgaos.jpg ) .
