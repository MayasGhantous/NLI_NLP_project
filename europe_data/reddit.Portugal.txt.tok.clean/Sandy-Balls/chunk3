  [ here is a video of them playing , but in poor quality . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h1afzqhcta#200s ), 
  well brasil has plenty of it , in fact galp has a big deposit of oil there . 
  do n't lose hope , galp ( petrobas to be more precise ) is going to begin driling for oil in 2013 . 
  i just hope there is oil in those waters to get us out of the crisis . 
  reunite the south and north galicia after 900 years . 
  we pretty much [ own half of the north atantic . 
  they say b instead of v like we in the north so they 'll blend in quickly . 
  and we ca n't forget the one what would be the best of all , [ afonso , prince of portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso,_prince_of_portugal ) . 
  this man had as an heritage right the entire iberian peninsula , the country of spain ( at the time spain was the name given to the peninsula ) would have it 's capital in lisbon , the official language would be portuguese , and even if centuries latter they ( castilla and arragon ) revolted we would have most of the overseas possessions and galicia would side with us . 
  but he died in a `` accident '' while ridding with castillian nobles . 
  nobles that were never seen again . 
  the do n't buy us is the new do n't invade us ? 
  well last time spain had a plan to invade portugal was in 1975 when franco thought portugal was going to become communist . 
  [ suck it spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_valverde_%281385%29 ) as a side note , we had a badass general , one of the best of all time , but it is not widely known because we are portuguese and we have a low `` morale '' of our patrimony and history . 
  just read this from that battle :  nuno \u00c1lvares pereira himself , seeing the banner of the grand master of santiago , fought his way trough the castilian army until encountering him , and after a brief duel , the grand master fell mortally wounded . 
  it 's like i am watching the patriot , version xiv century . 
  on a serious note portugal , we need to `` advertise '' more what we have . 
  the other countries have whole infrastructures to show a boulder and we have wonders that go unnoticeable . 
  [ here in portugal it has a slightly different meaning nowadays . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_s%c3%b3crates ) ^ tl ; dr : ^ he ^ brought ^ the ^ debt ^ from ^ 60 % ^ gdp ^ to ^ 107 % ^ gdp . 
  also he called for international help and the ran to france with 30 millions in his pocket to take philosophy classes ( ironic right ? 
  ) , classes he stopped going after the first trimester . 
  the only place in spain i call feel comfortable is in galicia . 
  also we have an expression that says `` from spain neither good winds nor good marriages '' ( de espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos ) which is used when your sceptic from something of spain . 
  only 30 years from now we have been creating good relations with them , before then we were `` with the backs to spain and to the world '' , because we had countless attempts of assimilation from spain , and they still have n't returned oliven\u00e7a to us . 
  do n't you even think of touching the cod , at least not this close to christmas . 
  was n't the deployment of missiles in turkey that triggered the cuba missiles crisis ? 
  let 's play a game called `` spot the russian '' . 
  i have translated the titles, 
  i am on my phone , i 'll do my best to translate . 
  `` the capital '' ( name of the newspaper ) . 
  portugal and germany . 
  the declaration of war was read today in the parliament . 
  mr of minister of foreign affairs read all the documents relative to the last international situation - the english government solicited , in the name of the alliance , the requisition of german ships . 
  in the note , delivered yesterday by mr.roger , the german government declared state of war - mr. alexandre braga proposed the constitution of a national government , idea already stated by mr. afonso costa - patriotic speeches by party officials - public manifestations . 
  glory to portugal !, 
  the [ treaty between portugal and uk ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) was signed in 1373 , when england was named just england ( sorry wales ) , and that why i have put `` england ( uk ) '' in the title . 
  why ? 
  [ according to wikipedia there is an organized group of romanian criminals plaguing europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_mafia ) it has in the last 10 years spilled from spain to portugal . 
  a search in google yields dozens of news ( in portuguese ) of romanian mafia busts , so there is a confirmations that they are here . 
  the crimes they perpetrate range from human trafficking , to murder , falsification and so on . 
  portugal has an epidemic of romanian mafia so you are also exporting the most dangerous ones . 
  just recently my small town had a murder by the romanian mafia . 
  this is a list of the ** major ** conflicts between our countries . 
  however there is a giant list of skirmishes and minor conflicts that are not listed . 
  i will , however , list the skirmishes that lead to our independence from leon . 
  [ battle of s\u00e3o mamede ( 1128 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s%c3%a3o_mamede ) , the skirmishes lasted until 1143 , when the treaty of zamora was signed . 
  hostilities resumed between 1167 and 1169 ( i will make a special note in the end regarding this mini-war ) . 
  between 1192 and 1201 the kingdom of leon and portugal resumed again a state of war . 
  hostilities also broke arround the year of 1250 due to the conquest of algarve , which castille claimed has theirs . 
  this war ended with portugal recognized as the ruller of the [ kingdom of algarve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_algarve ) [ 1383 -- 85 crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1383%e2%80%931385_portuguese_interregnum ) , when castile intervened unsuccessfully in a portuguese civil war [ war of the castilian succession \\ ( 1475 -- 79 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_castilian_succession ) , when portugal intervened in a castilian civil war , which ended with a portugueses naval victory and a castilian land victory [ war of the portuguese succession \\ ( 1580 -- 83 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_portuguese_succession ) , when portugal passed under the rule of the spanish monarchy [ portuguese restoration war \\ ( 1640 -- 68 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_restoration_war ) , when portugal regained its full sovereignty [ war of the spanish succession \\ ( 1701 -- 13 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_spanish_succession ) [ spanish -- portuguese war \\ ( 1735 -- 37 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish%e2%80%93portuguese_war_\\ ( 1735 % e2 % 80 % 9337 \\ ) ) , fought over the banda oriental ( uruguay ) [ spanish -- portuguese war \\ ( 1762 -- 63 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_invasion_of_portugal_\\ ( 1762 \\ ) ) , known as the fantastic war [ spanish -- portuguese war \\ ( 1776 -- 77 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish%e2%80%93portuguese_war_\\ ( 1776 % e2 % 80 % 9377 \\ ) ) , fought over the border between spanish and portuguese south america [ war of the oranges in 1801 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_oranges ) , when spain and france defeated portugal in the iberian peninsula , while portugal defeated spain in south america - lead to the lost of oliven\u00e7a [ invasion of portugal \\ ( 1807 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_portugal_\\ ( 1807 \\ ) ) , a french invasion initially supported by spain i am also not listing the conflicts that had a spanish influence and harmed portugal , like the entire [ dutch-portugal wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch%e2%80%93portuguese_war ) , that lead to the lost of the east indies , because spain forced us into war and showed the english and dutch how wealthy the eastern trade was making us . 
  ( spain destroyed our empire :( ) a comment i made about the 1167-1169 portuguese-le\u00f3n hostilities . 
   looking at this map makes me wonder how our country would have been if we had not lost badajoz , caceres and the surrounding provinces in 1169 . 
   history is funny , the unification of lusitania was not completed due to a freak accident , a horse riding accident . 
   one of our [ generals captured ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_the_fearless#conflict_with_le.c3.b3n ) badajoz in 1168 and called our king to help finish the last resistance of the moors . 
  however the army of the kingdom of leon came to help the moors and forced our king to retreat . 
  in the retreat he suffered a femur fracture and was captured . 
   as a [ ransom the kingdom of leon ] ( https://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpt.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fcerco_de_badajoz&amp;edit-text= ) demanded a large sum of gold , the cities and surrounding areas of [ cac\u00e9res ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%a1ceres,_spain ) , [ trujilho ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/trujillo_\\ ( espanha \\ ) ) , and [ montanche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mont%c3%a1nchez ) . 
  besides that portugal was to renounce any claim on [ badajoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/province_of_badajoz ) . 
   had our king not been captured by nuestros hermanos the [ lusitania province ] ( http://unravellingmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/0505m2.png ) would have been pretty much unified and portugal would have been stronger in the long term . 
   i am sorry , i just love to analyse history and imagine different outcomes to some scenarios . 
  oh yeah , my bad . 
  it is rightful portuguese territory stolen by the kingdom of leon using [ blackmailing ] ( https://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpt.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fcerco_de_badajoz&amp;edit-text= ) and worse , by aiding the moors against portugal . 
  [ come back ] ( http://unravellingmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/0505m2.png ) to your hermanos extremadura . 
  lets be lusitans once again :d, 
  well that area was not always the barren wasteland ( jk ) that alentejo is classified today . 
  besides that we would get big cities like badajoz , which was the capital of lusitania and was the capital of many provinces ever since , so a big acquisition for our kingdom at the time . 
  lets not forget that we surrendered badajoz [ a second time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badajoz#1660.e2.80.931811 ) in 1715 in return for south american provinces ( uruguay to be more exact ) . 
  so we abdicated of expanding the mainland in favour of getting a province that would revolt in 100 years . 
  looking at this map makes me wonder how our country would have been if we had not lost badajoz , caceres and the surrounding provinces in 1169 .

  i am sorry , i just love to analyse history and imagine different outcomes to some scenarios . 
  it is practically the size of madrid metro area, 
  i was quoting rtp . 
  they changed to fire related because of that tragedy . 
  spain has already sent help with two canadair planes . 
  it is already the biggest tragedy in portugal in the last 50 years , you have to go back to the times of the ultramarine war to see numbers like this . 
  edit : ** death toll is at 62 ** , most of them died in their cars as they were surprised by the flames edit2 : people in portugal do not usually abandon everything in case of a fire near their houses . 
  they stay behind and help the firefighters fight the fire , either with logistic support ( food , drinkable water , place to rest ) or with raw manpower . 
  in this case they stayed behind waiting for the fireman but there were not enough to fight in every place . 
  when they decided to leave ( which is very rare ) it was to late . 
  so far 30 villages have been devoured by the flames . 
  to put in perspective , one of the most known `` memes '' in portugal is a man that says to the news that he has a medic a point mentioned so he is going to abandon his house that is being threaten by the fire . 
  the idea of leaving in a situation like this is so alien in portugal that it is a running joke . 
  [ video in question ] ( https://youtu.be/roc8wvf1dwo ), 
  omg , yes , that was the video that made me use this name . 
  never thought people would connect the two, 
  there is also bacalhau in our coast , although not as much as it used to . 
  brazil had around 60,000 murders last year and portugal was in the low 100 , so , in a day more than a year sources : `` another study has the 2015 murder rate at 32.4 per 100,000 , with 64,357 homicides . '', 
  `` there were a total of 122 murders in portugal in 2012 '', 
  i actually like portugal was the only one that did not go full `` like , comment , subscribe '' during the recap . 
  the minimum temperature was 1\u00bac so that was quite plausible , especially if you go wait for it at 6 am , but after 10 in the morning things get pretty comfortable .
