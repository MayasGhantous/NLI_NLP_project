  at least 50 % or exactly 50 % ? 
  because if it 's the later , it would be quite funny . 
   you were born independentist , just like your parents and your brother . 
   your opinion matters so little . 
  it 's not the first time i ask you , and always regarding catalonia independence . 
  can you please phrase your arguments without insulting someone ? 
  edit : may i propose a ban on catalonia related issues , redirecting them towards r/spain ? 
  most of the time the post descends into a senseless argument between a few recurrent spaniards and catalans , without much input from the rest of r/europe . 
  greece in eastern europe confirmed . 
  maybe the name comes from that guy from star trek , heineken skywalker . 
  it might be the case for some such as am\u00e9rico amorim , but some might have inherit the wealth . 
  besides , your premisse is not correct as , as much as we might want to claim that we live in a meritocracy , it is not hard to find cases of jobs and promotions that do n't take the merit into account . 
  unless you consider that they had the merit of having the right connections in the right time . 
  that she has or she is married to someone with portuguese ancestry . 
  from what year exactly ? 
  seeing the rest of europe , i would n't say ireland is ordinary . 
  no way it would be possible . 
  it happens in the end of the video . 
  why would n't iceland be european ? 
  yeah , what would you think would be the data for malta ? 
  we had to be mississippi had n't we ? 
  ( at least i think its mississippi ) . 
  why ? 
  did it melt ? 
  iceland is in the rift , but culturally it is european , so it seems odd not to including them . 
  yeah , you are right . 
  although the map was cut a but above malta , but i had n't notice it , so nice catch . 
  i 'm pretty sure its polandball . 
  with a booming tourism industry , i do n't think that is the answer . 
  well , since we can not rename fyrom , we will rename macedonia . 
  another problem solved . 
  next , the israel-palestine thingy . 
  i 'm now thinking that this link could have being a lot of things . 
  i probably should stop clicking in links i find in reddit . 
   the idea that brexit will be the catalyst , though , is absurd why is that an absurd ? 
  britain will not pass through easy times . 
  a lot of eu law will have to be converted into british law and if that is not done with care , plenty of loopholes could be explored leading to a crisis , or at the very least an unpleasant situation , down the line , to which the uk certainly wo n't certainly welcome . 
  we should n't be pretending brexit wo n't be hard , because everyone knows it wo n't . 
  may 's government will be facing a tremendous challenge , even more after her failed gamble , so they ca n't afford to be reckless instead of having your attitude of `` it has not being a problem until now , it wo n't be after brexit either '' . 
  it seems more like an advise on your course of action than a threat , but you may take it as you please . 
  you probably should know , though , that ignoring it does n't prevent the problem from arising in the future . 
  this seems a thread that is capable of generating interesting discussion . 
  i do n't think it needs to be redirected towards r/askeurope . 
  regardless of how you feel regarding jeremy corbyn or anything eu related , bringing him is indeed quite important for the stability of the deal . 
  he 's after all the leader of the major opposition party and has chances of toppling may . 
  with that prospect , may has not the strong hand needed to ensure any compromise will be approved by the parliament , delaying and complicating the situation even further . 
  having corbyn would strength the british position a bit so that they could actually negotiate for their country . 
  may has already tried to open up to the opposition but it will fall short if they are n't capable of ceding ground to them . 
  i would say this comment makes a lot of sense for the eu and uk . 
  do you enjoy using coloured pants ? 
  unfortunately pretty much no one cares about the un and i 'm not seeing them setting up laws for corporate exploration . 
   by definition this does n't make any sense . 
  did you decided to use it just to make your comment sound smart ? 
  there is nothing in the definition of `` space '' that could make you conclude nobody owns it . 
  no , you do . 
  probably thinking life works as in a computer game ... 
  what a pure show of ignorance that comment was !, 
  space law , like any law , works because it is recognizable . 
  your comment could very well be applied to earth . 
  if i raise and army and conquer your house , good luck trying to stop me . 
  of course , i very much would like you to be able to pull of such a plan without facing severe consequences from other the other nations or citizens . 
  [ we know how to have some fun ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/2498740e-b911-3dbf-942d-ecce511a351e?mhq5j=e2 ) without germany and germany-vassals intervention . 
  it all started in the distant year of 1128 , when afonso henriques decided to declare war to his own mother for the control of the county of portugal , declaring independence in 1143 . 
  but those pesky early spaniards of l\u00e9on did n't like our independence , so [ we fought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_valdevez ) and we [ won ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_zamora ) . 
  in the next century , portugal did its part in the reconquista , even [ helping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_las_navas_de_tolosa ) those useless kingdoms in the peninsula fighting theirs . 
  oh , but their treacherous nature would eventually reemerge . 
  after eating l\u00e9on , castille now looked hungry at our godly kingdom of portugal and , in a moment of weakness , [ during a succession crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1383%e2%80%931385_portuguese_interregnum ) , they attack . 
  after several battles and with the help of our new english friends against that coalition of the spaniards and frenchies , with strategical mastery , [ we emerged victorious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota ) . 
  [ killing castillians was now our national sport ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulang%c3%a8re_d%27aljubarrota ) . 
  portugal then went to became a nation of explorers , giving new worlds to the world . 
  but spain was always watching every move . 
  jealous of our glory , they sought to [ undermines us with the pope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) . 
  still we controlled the riches of india , ruling the seas and [ protecting the christendom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abyssinian%e2%80%93adal_war ) against the [ threats of the turk menace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93portuguese_conflicts ) . 
  but like the people say : `` from spain , there 's no good wind neither good marriage '' . 
  and so [ we lost our king and nobility fighting the moors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_alc%c3%a1cer_quibir ) , and [ we lost our independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_alc%c3%a2ntara_ ( 1580 ) ) . 
  oh , great kingdom , now ruled from madrid , of all places !, 
  due to their [ mismanagements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_armada ) we were [ raided by the rebelling dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch%e2%80%93portuguese_war ) . 
  but we had it enough and a [ new king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_iv_of_portugal ) sought to [ make portugal great again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_restoration_war ) . 
  but [ then the french came ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) and of course , [ spain came with them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_portugal_ ( 1807 ) ) . 
  but we rebelled and [ they came second time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war#second_portuguese_campaign.2c_1808.e2.80.931809 ) . 
  third time and plague [ was finally repelled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sabugal ) culminating in the [ congress of vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_vienna ) that spain [ remains to honor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) . 
  but we have proven our value . 
  portugal independence was assure once again and never again put into question ( [ i 'm looking at you britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ) ) . 
  we 've put nuestros hermanos in their place whenever they wish to [ challenge our rule ] ( http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1581/match=1059180/index.html ) in our home . 
  ps : the comment should be read with an / s. 
  do n't take it too seriously . 
  yes , you 've missed our entire history . 
  c'mon , it is indeed quite creepy . 
  we could argue if it deserved the uproar it caused , but he a president talking to the wife of another head of state . 
  could n't he phrased better or refrain from comment it altogether ? 
  this post is absolute bullshit . 
  enough of this eesti propaganda . 
  do not believe in this post and do n't watch the video . 
  op is a liar and should be banned for sowing confusion and despair . 
  never again i will be able to trust a post in the internet , because of this reckless and malicious behavior . 
  the video has only 25 seconds !, 
  it does ? 
  i guess it 's time for czech rhapsody . 
  poor lorenz , not getting the reconnaissance he deserves . 
  just tell them you are russian .
