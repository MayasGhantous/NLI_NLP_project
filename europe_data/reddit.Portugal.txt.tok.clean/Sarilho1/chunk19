  in islam you can get different schools of thought that would be impossible in medieval christianity . 
   didnt pre-nicea have more deviations tho since the council lead to the uniform doctrine ? 
  i would n't call it deviations since the initial doctrine was more open . 
  the council of nicea eventually deemed the work of arius and others heretical and establish the core principles of the church . 
  before the council those `` deviations '' were allowed , after they were no more . 
  that has nothing to do with what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm not making a argument that islam  christianity or the other way around , i 'm simply stating the fact that , based on their structure , islam allows for a bit more dissent that christianity . 
  yes , but its the pope who does that , not the priests . 
  it was just a joke because of the ` period ' , not because of the content of the comment , but i 've realized it was not pence , but sean spicer . 
  i could still try to salvage the joke relating it to pence periods , but i 've done goof anyway . 
  well , in the north in porto we have great beaches , but often it is often plagued by the northern winds ( there 's a saying , from spain does n't come neither good wind or good marriage ) . 
  the water is also way colder than in the south . 
  if you are ok with that , the beaches are nice . 
  apart from that , both cities are great to have fun . 
  if you 've never visit any of them , i urge you to do it . 
  thanks , pence . 
  edit : i messed up with the joke ... 
  considering the social history of the us , i would n't say that is true at all . 
  we 've leading the way in many issues , they 've lead in others . 
  i would say they are simply liberal or democratic values that any inclusive society eventually adopts , but you can accuse me of being bias on that . 
  he 's right though . 
  christianity laws were defined in several councils were islam was more spontaneous . 
  the bible is more strict while koran is more open to interpretation and that is what has being causing problems ironically . 
  i think eating is essential more than once . 
  we have one that means basically the same thing that is : ** ir de cavalo para burro ** ( lit . 
  * go from horse to donkey * , might be though as * change your horse for a donkey * or something along those lines ) . 
  from the top of my head , we have the following ones in portuguese ( there are , of course , many more ) . 
  i think they are used nationally , but there are a lot of local expressions in different parts of the country that are often not understood in the other regions . 
  - ** deixar tudo em \u00e1guas de bacalhau ** ( * leave everything in cod waters * ) - do not do anything about it ; e.g. 
  : everyone was outraged about the fire but in the end everything was left in cod waters . 
  - ** levar \u00e1gua no bico ** ( * carry water in the beak * ) - having hiding purposes ; e.g. 
  : he helped his grandma , but clearly he carried water in the beak . 
  - ** puxar a brasa \u00e0 sua sardinha ** ( * pull the embers to his/hers sardine * ) - try to take personal advantage of a situation ; e.g. 
  : we went to the meeting together but everyone was pulling the embers to his own sardine . 
  - ** cu de judas/onde judas perdeu as botas ** ( * judas ' ass/where judas lost its boots * ) - a very distant place ; e.g. 
  : he bought his computer in judas ' ass/where judas lost its boots . 
  - ** p\u00f4r os pontos nos `` i '' ** ( * put the points in the `` ii '' * [ plural of i ] ) - clarify with great detail a situation ; e.g. 
  : i need to put the points in the `` ii '' regarding our relationship . 
  - ** nem oito nem oitenta ** ( * neither eight or eighty * ) - be moderate about something ( choose something in the middle ) ; e.g. 
  : i want a middle sized composition . 
  neither eight ( small text ) or eighty ( writing a will ) . 
  - ** escrever um testamento ** ( * writing a will * ) - write a long text ; e.g. 
  : ( see above - i did n't plan this one , but i though i should explain it . ), 
  yeah , reuters includes that part . 
  i guess terrorism sells more these days . 
  i would say they would try to sell to third world conflicts or to organized crime . 
  everyone calm down , it is not the first time weapons are stolen from military bases here in portugal . 
  / s jokes aside . 
  this is quite a serious case and i do hope responsibilities and measures are taken accordingly . 
  i specially would like our european partners as well as nato to put pressure in portugal regarding this , so that the issue is not simply forgotten . 
  regarding where will this stolen material end up , we can only speculate , but my take is that they will try to sell it to ongoing conflicts in africa or organized crime in latin america , but if they are n't able to take it out of the country , a terrorist group in europe might be a possibility , although i do n't take them as the preferred costumer . 
  hopefully none of that happens and the weapons are recovered , but this is disgraceful nonetheless . 
  what about the queen harpooning wales ? 
  exactly the same happens with the faroe islands ( and greenland ) regarding denmark . 
  aland is also often counted as a different entity than finland . 
  edit : i was also thinking about the netherlands , since their structure is also similar to the uk and denmark , but only the mainland is in europe , so i think we can skip that example . 
  cameron tried what ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i think i can say objectively that this is among the most beautiful parliaments shown . 
  the one in the middle is the statue of the republic . 
  originally intended to represent d. manuel ii , the end of the monarchy changed the original intent to represent the portuguese republic . 
  so , about that dinner ... 
   some people still do n't get it and deny it and they are right to do it . 
  weather is clearly a chinese hoax . 
  many other regions have high degrees of devolution , yet they did n't make the list . 
  what is exactly the criteria ? 
  how did this happen ? 
  yes , that 's a positive , but the noises and cheers from the backbenches as well as the constant interruptions seem a bit childish . 
  i mean , we also have that , but it is not supposed to be common behaviour while in britain it seems entrenched in the parliamentary culture . 
  i 'm not urging you to change it , it has being working for quite some time . 
  it just feels really strange . 
  he really needs to stop with this arrogant behaviour . 
  it will eventually cost him down the line for nothing . 
  i 've never understood how a proper discussion can happen there . 
  you could argue that parliaments do n't see proper discussions anyway , but they could at least try . 
  that thing seems a common market or a fair . 
  but it 's exciting , i give them that . 
  it 's the other parliament . 
  estonian language is extremely funny . 
  it sounds a bit like arabic . 
  after hearing the pm talking softly in english , i got confused if , in his speech in estonian , he was praising europe or declaring war to it . 
  why not just call it , uboat ? 
  `` dear audience , the main aim of the estonian presidency is to achieve balance { in the force } through unity . 
  in the ~ ~ galactic empire ~ ~ european union , we must strike a balance in the east and the west , the north and the south , great and small , new and tradicional , { the light and the darkness } . '', 
  this graphic is interesting in itself , though . 
  it really explains why a lot of portuguese living along the border usually cross it to refuel in spain ( our prime-minister even asked the portuguese to not do it ) . 
  i suspect the same happens in other borders , such the polish/german one . 
  i guess it makes sense . 
  it was just so quick that i doubt it would have any influence . 
  but is nice that it has finally passed , at least . 
  german coins are quite common . 
  i already have a nice collection of coins but just a few commemoratives . 
  those are almost impossible to get around here . 
  wait you 've rushed the protest because a law was about to get passed ? 
  why not just cancel if your goal was achieved ? 
  first of all , just because another thing is basilar to the existence of the society , does n't exclude all the others . 
  applying the same logic , speech is also necessary for the society to exist , thus agriculture is not important . 
  that is false . 
  anyway , i was arguing about the building of the modern society , although you can see some of my examples were also applied in earlier ages . 
   as many as 95 % of any population did not known how to read for centuries .
