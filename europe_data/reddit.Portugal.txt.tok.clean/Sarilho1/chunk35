   you people are all talking from your perspectives and disregard ours exactly like you are doing ? 
  i could n't care less if you have a rest day at sunday or not , i 'm simply focusing on a part of the discussion that you disregarded . 
  with less than a quarter of the vote . 
  the second round is what counts and hardly will the margin be as small as 2.1 %, 
  he does n't seem the type of populism they are interested in . 
  you know more about the subject than myself , but i would expect them to cheer more for lega nord than for m5s . 
  i 'm curious , how did they overcome the dutch election ? 
  did they simply pretend it did n't happen ? 
  68 % increase for em since last election . 
  m\u00e9lenchon wo n't reach the second round but he can still erode le pen 's percentage and end ahead of fillion . 
  i guess it 's the time for endorse macron , but he can still claim a good result . 
  like your comments . 
  yeah ... 
  thanks for reminding me of that . 
  aaaand , macron is ahead . 
  macron surpassed le pen in the official results . 
  not surprising that some are . 
  good that it 's so low . 
  even less than fillion 's ones , that 's good . 
  relevant username, 
  every 5 years . 
  wait , is n't that exactly what germans like ? 
  [ communes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communes_of_france ) are administrative regions of france , so they have really different numbers of voters . 
  thanks you . 
  it 's ok , it happens . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  there are a lot of sources . 
  where are you getting these results ? 
  god dammit !, 
  double post happens , but five comments ? 
  damn , that was some extreme lag . 
  he just spoke . 
  i watched it in [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn7snckzrq4 ), 
  portuguese tv ? 
  it does but it 's only in 5 % and the results are in a italian website . 
  i do n't know how reliable they usually are . 
  anyway , it 's quite a big lead if confirmed . 
  you believe that you think that she can ? 
  macron pr\u00e9sident sounds like a cheese . 
  right now , according to this [ source ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2017/elezioni/francia/ ) , he 's in second after le pen in the region of marseille . 
  in paris , the results are n't significative yet . 
  sorry for the inconvenience . 
  i did n't though the joke would be so spread as it was . 
  she would have lost anyway because she was a terrible candidate . 
  her entire campaign was an attack on donald trump , nothing about the actual issues afflicting the american people . 
  people were n't even capable of naming three policies of her . 
  bernie stayed until the convention as it in the convention when the votes are actually counted . 
  once he lost , he endorsed . 
  what where you expecting , a crown for clinton 's head ? 
  no source , only a lack of / s. 
  i though it was n't needed , but someone decided to spread the joke and confuse everybody . 
  i 'll make an edit . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  he endorsed after loosing to her . 
  and what exactly did you wanted him to do that would be a proper attempt , forcing them to vote for her at gun point ? 
  wake up for reality , please . 
  so ... do n't do that ? 
  le pen discoursed and op made a joke about macron receiving endorsements from everyone . 
  yes , le pen is endorsing macron now . 
  ** / s ** edit : adding an / s. 
  it was a joke , do n't kill me please . 
   give up a whole lot quicker in france bring up the meme !, 
  it 's hard to believe that right wing voters hate their country to vote for le pen . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  besides macron is center , he will get a lot of the fillion vote , if not the majority . 
  a 30 min shit must be a great shit . 
  just to continue the list of live streams , in portuguese , rtp has [ live coverage ] ( https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/eleicoes-em-franca-acompanhe-em-direto_e997165# ) ( [ livestream in rtp3 ] ( https://www.rtp.pt/play/direto/rtp3 ) ), 
  i 'm a leftist , but not as much as m\u00e9lenchon . 
  hamon would be my perfect candidate . 
  i 'm a bit sad about him . 
  edit : english, 
  congrats , i laughed . 
  yeah , sure ... 
  not big surprise there . 
  legend says you are still running . 
  catalonian ? 
  i mean , there some catalans in france , but i do n't believe they are that significative . 
  i 'm a bit more impressed by those who voted sarkozy or le pen in 2012 and m\u00e9lenchon in 2017 . 
  it just seems weird because in past elections the megathread was always the main post for the results , so the discussion would n't spread for various threads . 
  i just need to get used to it , thank you for answering . 
  i know where to find it , but it seems more relevant than this . 
  where 's the megathread now ? 
  he just saw that being reported in fox news : `` very interesting , democratic countries hold elections . '', 
  yeah , but macron being pro-european would probably mean he would respect the paris agreement and try to reach the european targets to tackle climate change , so i do n't think he would be that bad . 
  besides , the french people seem to be for tackling climate change , so they just have to say that to macron and he would agree . 
  nah , your own personal colapse after a le pen lost would be enough for me . 
  ... in french . 
  yeah , i get you . 
  thank you for you work . 
  even if muslim , that comment is quite hypocritical . 
  `` muslims should adapt or go away !, 
  oh , you are a syrian , why are n't you using a burka ? 
  there is massively movements for change . 
  the problem is that everyone expects different things from the eu . 
  yes , that 's expected , but those areas are geographically quite different from the rest of france . 
  i do n't know their voting patterns , thus asking , but , unless otherwise stated by her , they might stand to loose with a le pen presidency . 
   european union was created to suffocate european nations inc. military wow , you are completely out of touch with reality . 
  european union was created to suffocate european nations military ? 
  ceca was created to ensure the sharing of vital materials would n't lead to more wars . 
  the eu was created much latter and certainly not to control anyone 's military .
