  the fact that your country was , until very recently one of the most anti-militaristic countries in europe makes you sound like an idiot . 
   after ww2 they tried to halt the progress of germany so more wars do n't start yes , because everyone knows that the natural order of things is for germany to start invading it 's neighbors . 
  / s  everyone says so . 
  typical donald trump trait . 
  maybe you should start doing your own research instead of relying in fox fake news to construct your poor sourced `` facts '' . 
   le pen did way better in all three regions . 
  that was expected . 
  why was le pen expected to do better in those regions ? 
  are you saying that simply because of her surge nationally or is there any special reason for that result to be expected ? 
   none of them mean anything at all i do n't think that 's exactly what you meant to say , right ? 
  i agree , but i will downvote you anyway because you choose to insult instead of making a constructive argument . 
  you are entitled to support a corrupt and liar candidate such as fillion , but if someones roots for le pen he 's a bot . 
  you might disagree with him , like i disagree with both of you , but that certainly does n't mean you can dismiss other people like that . 
  this made me smile . 
  poor slovenia , the uk took its name . 
  edit : english, 
  the m\u00e9lenchonomy ? 
  it seems to me macron is more economically liberal than fillion . 
  edit : corrections, 
  he agrees with you . 
  i 'm so confused about this comment . 
  you are a liberal in what sense ? 
  edit : to clarify , my confusion is because macron . 
  it seems to me he 's more liberal than fillion . 
  i might be wrong , but i would expect a free market supporter to be a strong macron supporter . 
  pretty much the only left in the race is m\u00e9lenchon ( maybe le pen in economic terms ) and it 's not terribly likely he 's ( or they are ) going to win . 
  yeah , i even heard some portuguese people saying that ( my highschool portuguese teacher comes to mind ) and i do agree it sounds a bit similar . 
  i found interesting that as a romance language we end up with an accent so characteristic of slavic languages . 
  brazilian accent is completely different . 
  same could be said about the uk and we are seeing scotland pushing for independence , not england . 
   making it less german-centric during the economic crisis everyone was calling for germany to take a more active role . 
  now it is too much . 
  i think the national governments should man up instead of crying to the eu every time they have a problem to solve that could cost them votes . 
  it 's easy to blame the eu for everything , but the fact is that they are afraid the voters see their incompetence . 
  are you suggesting we need a civil war or the wwii already counts as it ? 
  every locality in portugal has it 's own patron saint and they often have a local holiday in that day . 
  in lisbon it 's [ saint anthony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthony_of_padua ) , in porto is [ saint john ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/festa_de_s%c3%a3o_jo%c3%a3o_do_porto ) and so on . 
  there are often popular celebrations and fairs on those days . 
  pretty much like christmas , i think , most people do n't celebrate it because it is a religious festivity but because it 's cultural . 
  he has the argentinian flag , i do n't know if that is the problem . 
  does portuguese really sound like a slavic language ? 
  does this law prohibits divulging the results or the media from divulging the results ? 
  because if it 's the later , it 's quite a ridiculous one . 
  damn , m\u00e9lanchon is a savage . 
  i pay around 1000 $ per year . 
  i 'm not saying my family can not afford it , although it 's a bit annoying being such a burden . 
  the state does indeed help , i think it goes up to 1500 $ per year ( maybe a bit more , but i 'm not sure , if you had to move to another city ) , but still working students are a reality and there are mechanisms to help them out . 
  some might simply want to get money for themselves , others may want to help their families . 
  whichever is the case , working students exist . 
  the problem is even worst for those studying in private universities . 
  it 's not exactly easy to present free tuition while recovering from a economic crisis , though . 
  not that i disagree with you , but in our current reality , that 's what we have to deal with . 
  so , instead of making it harder in order to achieve some ideological purpose that is currently unattainable , i would say it would be better to let them work on sunday instead of forcing them to work regardless on any other day . 
  cyprus as well . 
  many might actually need to get a job to pay for the university , for example . 
  working on sundays is often better than working after school if you are studying and with a job . 
  it 's clearly a turtle . 
  before . 
  do you think so ? 
  it seems he would have really no chance of winning . 
  i expect some blaming him and stating that valls would do a better job , but i would expect the majority to acknowledge that whichever the candidate , the socialist party would loose terribly . 
  yet , macron would probably would get the vote of the left that would not abstain , if against fillion , while he might loose it against le pen . 
  still , he would win , but i think he would win easily against fillion too , with a huge help from his scandal . 
   why would a belgian give a shit about me , a random guy from bucharest ? 
  i understand the concern , but in your own parliament , i presume you 'll have mp 's from everywhere in the nation . 
  why would a mp from cluj-napoca care about you in bucharest ? 
  how do you hold mp 's accountable in the national case ? 
  are you telling me the flags do n't have dots ? 
  i said `` seized '' mentioning d. miguel , not d. pedro iv . 
  still , i dislike the term i choose , but it seemed appropriate for a quick comment . 
  i was hoping the people would actually search the link to get more and more correct information . 
  i though about including him too , but there were so many to choose that i simply skipped . 
  regarding historical figures we have a lot . 
  if you read `` os lus\u00edadas '' from cam\u00f5es or `` a mensagem '' from fernando pessoa , you 'll see some examples and the mystic their is around them . 
  of course , in history matters the deeds live on and the mischief are forgotten or ignored . 
  by i will try to compile a list . 
  * [ viriatus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viriatus ) - often quoted by epic writers as the first portuguese , he fought bravely against rome until the day he was murdered by their own . 
  * [ afonso henriques ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) - first king of portugal , father of the nationality . \u00b4 * [ nuno \u00c1lvares pereira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuno_%c3%81lvares_pereira ) - a general that was responsible for the defeat of castille , even heavily outnumbered , and preserve the independence that was threatened . 
  * [ prince henry the navigator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_henry_the_navigator ) - he initiated the explorations and conquests that eventually turned portugal into a worldwide colonial empire . 
  * [ john ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_ii_of_portugal ) - he strengthened the portuguese economy and relaunched the explorations that took the portuguese to india and brazil ( which did n't live long enough to see ) . 
  he divided the world with castille with the [ treaty of \u00c1lca\u00e7ovas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_alc%c3%a1%c3%a7ovas ) * [ d. sebasti\u00e3o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sebastian_of_portugal ) - not exactly a hero , but he 's an important figure in epic literature . 
  his campaign and death in north africa , while very young and heirless , meant spain inherited portugal . 
  he was often sung as the king that would return from the haze ( '' * among the haze of memory * '' ) to return portugal to it 's former glory . 
  * [ d. pedro iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_i_of_brazil ) - probably a controversial one . 
  heir to the throne of portugal , when his father died he did n't want to return to the metropole so he declared brazil 's independence ( he was their because rio de janeiro was portugal 's capital during the napoleon invasions and he decided to stay after the court returned to portugal ) . 
  he gave the throne to his daughter , but married to her uncle that was an absolutist . 
  he seized the nation to himself and d. pedro renounced the brazilian throne to fight his brother in the liberal wars , which he won , protecting the gains of the [ liberal revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_revolution_of_1820 ) . 
  * [ humberto delgado ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humberto_delgado ) , the fearless general . 
  he challenged the regime and declared if he won , he would sack salazar . 
  he lost in a rigged system and was murdered in exile years later . 
  yet , he became a symbol for the desire for freedom and revolution . 
  * [ aristides de sousa mendes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aristides_de_sousa_mendes ) - quite a late entry , he 's now getting the recognition he deserves . 
  a former consul in france during wwii , he defied salazar he distributed around 30000 visas ( one third to jews ) to people fleeing the holocaust . 
  he ended his life in misery . 
  the list is far from exhaustive , from explorers , through artists and writers or other historical figures i have n't mention . 
  i believe this are some key figure that helped shape the country , but many can be included . 
  i guess we are french now . 
   portupain at least you did n't said sportugal . 
  then the stereotype of only a football country would fairly apply . 
   no brexit that sounds a bit funny .
