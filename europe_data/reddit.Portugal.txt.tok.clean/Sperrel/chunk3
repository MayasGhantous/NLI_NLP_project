  but you really ca n't generalize, 
  irish are so hardcore that a few years back the police discovered an ira cell in alvor , algarve . 
  yeah it probably because of the number of expats and turists / per capita . 
  algarve has a much smaller population than valencia and andalucia , thus , i presume , the foreign community and turists have a bigger impact than in the spanish regions .

  ** portugal ** os maias ( 1888 ) by e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3s . 
  a story about a young idealistic nobleman in the portuguese high society in lisbon . 
  begins with a 20 page description of his family palace in lisbon ( interior designers and architects will be amused ) . 
  a strong sarcastical critic of the state and the society of the country back then , still relevant in today 's portugal .

  why ca n't you get in heraldry :(, 
  yeap , i recently saw the documentary about it . 
  it was a galleon that shipwrecked in the gulf of cadiz , because it was near another ship that was sunk by the british navy the origin of the arteifacts was dubious.the american company managed to rescue tons of gold and silver coins but in the end the had to turn the treasure to spain .

  your explanation was exactly what i was looking for .

  everything was inspiring until he mentioned one direction . 
  the javelin 's spike is just some centimeters long and the spike is stuck in the back area of the bull that has the most amount of fat . 
  well here in portugal we also have bullfighting but it 's different . 
  there 's a part where a knight dressed like a 18th century noble sticks small javelins in the bull 's back and another where a group of mans ( forcados ) , dressed like 19th century ribatejan farmers , provoke the bull in order to secure him . 
  and as in southern france the bull is n't killed , although in a small town near the spanish border in alentejo they are allowed by law to kill the bull . 
  young people are n't not very enthusiastic about the show , and in the north of the country the show is n't also very popular . 
  i like the shows even though many people with my age dont like them . 
  it seems to me that the spectacle is only disliked because of the suffering of the bull , as most people actually enjoy the * forcados * part . 
  here is a horseman with the bull ( http://www.portalsaofrancisco.com.br/alfa/espanha/tourada32.jpg ) and * forcados * ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txrtuyv8wf0 ) .
