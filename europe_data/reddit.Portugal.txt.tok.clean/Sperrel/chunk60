  the eu was n't founded to instill an artificial common culture , that 's why its motto is in varietate concordia . 
  but what if one of the bigger forces is a populist party like m5s , pis or fp\u00d6 ? 
  with a fptp it only increases the chance populist get absolute control of parliament without the necessary popular vote . 
  even economically she is n't left wing . 
  read her programme . 
  completely agree with you . 
  there is a completely different view on the refugee crisis between western and eastern europe . 
  the blanket term is useful when you want to treat two different geographical areas in a more superficial manner . 
  obviously there are great differences between czech republic and latvia or romania but even then those differences are n't much compared to the generality of western countries . 
  there 's no need to have a pavlovian reaction against being included in eastern europe when it 's a cursory remark . 
  for example i do n't get butthurt when people talk about southern europe in opposition to northern europe or western europe . 
  despicable apologia of a terrorist attack . 
  it 's the same type of thinking that muslim terrorists use : `` they invaded the middle east , we need to retaliate !, 
  for a more simplistic discussion eastern europe is a valuable notion . 
  for example the attitudes in eu member states towards refugees and immigration , politics and other subjects . 
  as long as there are considerable differences between eastern and western europe , it 's useful . 
  the same about southern europe or balkans . 
  i 'm sorry but how would freedom of religion infringe in others ? 
  you 're actually advocating demolishing one of the most fought freedom in the world just because you 're anti-theist . 
  there 's not id in britain . 
  you do understand that today and for the foreseeable future eastern european means countries that were behind the iron curtain right ? 
  this kind of geographical labels have more to due with history , politics and other areas than only geography . 
  is that ironic or a genuine opinion ? 
  it 's not but it 's disingenuous to say that 's the opinion of most r/europe 's migration threads . 
  for starters when top comments call receiving refugees an ethnic replacement of european by `` globalist '' ( a term without meaning outside the internet ) and other boogeymen . 
  or that immigrants from certain parts of the globe can only lead to terrorism among others . 
  it 's not very different . 
  from two years ago to today every thread about migration wo n't deviate a lot from the standard far-right narrative . 
  for me it has been eye opening how most people incorporate the right-wing populist narrative . 
  rarely there are some reasonable threads where some users try to logically explain the problem 's of this kinds of narratives but even those are rare . 
  it was pretty straightforward from the beginning it would n't just be an economic union . 
  the best feature is getting a fishing licence from the atm . 
  i 'm not going to argue anything , i 've got better things to do than to argue on history with a far-right propagandist . 
  weak bait , try tomorrow 's migration thread . 
  there all kinds of economists as well there are all kinds of politicians . 
  but there 's nothing populistic with agreeing with macron on this topic , if you want we can see if it applies to political science definitions . 
  no , because the migration period in the late western roman empire does n't share a lot of similarities with contemporary migration crisis . 
  but good effort on your panichistory propaganda , sockpuppet . 
  man you 're going full / r/neoliberal shitposter . 
  if you have objections to ubi then you 're obviously in the wrong side of history . 
  i can totally understand how it 's appealing to right-wing proponents , my biggest grief is how even supposedly left-wingers ( here gr\u00fcne ) are willing to destroy part of it 's ideological background just to implement any form of ubi . 
  and i 'm not a fan of ubi : i 'm against it for being universal and unconditional among other reasons . 
   about 1,000 euros should then afterwards be paid to any workable , whether employed or not from the state plus a further amount for each child who lives in the household of the respective income recipients . 
  in return , all previous social benefits like hartz iv , wohngeld , kindergeld baf\u00f6g and so on would be dropped . 
  here it is . 
  let 's destroy social security for a flat rent !, 
  unfortunately i can not see a way british citizens can have an european citizenship without a legal link to a member state . 
   rather than embracing euroskeptics on the populist right , europe 's leftists should throw their support behind ** center-left french president macron 's policies ** to create a stronger eurozone . 
  the alternative is a splintered left and stronger right . 
  when it starts like this it 's a sign the author knows a lot on the left-wing perspective . 
  edit 1 : the gift keeps on giving :  in france , ** socialist party presidential candidate jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ** ran a campaign against the euro , the rich and the `` german poison , '' and garnered 20 percent of the vote in the process . 
  apart from the propaganda angle i always wonder how much of state aid/subsidies they think they can get `` back '' . 
  probably around 1-2 % . 
  but those policies could be part of any party from social-democrats to ecr conservatives . 
  it 's like saying the tories are n't conservative just because a small minority voted for gay marriage . 
  almost all new parties popping in europe do n't have a coherent name . 
  in terms of radical right wing parties even more ( party for freedom , ukip , fp\u00d6 ( freedom ) , sweden democrats , etc ) . 
  that 's why we have an independent judiciary and human rights . 
  apart from the jungle not really . 
  that 's has more to do with northern france post industrial decay than immigration . 
  i think that area does n't even has a lot of immigrants . 
  it is . 
  we have our coast guard in greece as well as receiving a substantial number of refugees . 
  the reasons to welcome refugees are vast and easy to read on the internet . 
   i remember that one of the main issues behind brexit was precisely immigration ... not respecting the will of the v4 people on this issue will end badly . 
  then you might not know that in terms of immigration that subject was entirely dependent on british sovereignty . 
  afterall they were n't in schengen nor were coerced to be open to eastern european migrants . 
   not respecting the will of the v4 people on this issue will end badly . 
  go ahead , the v4 need more the eu than the opposite . 
  in terms of central eu principals i 'm in favour of not budging to those that do n't comply . 
  suit yourself , you 're not here to act in good faith anyway . 
  i do n't think they kill anyone altought there are various cases where refugees were abused by those guards . 
  there 's even a case in the european court of human rights regarding one of those abuses . 
  a barbed wire fence with armed guards that do n't give a shit about human rights . 
  yeah if we all build a iron wall from rostock to split maybe we 'll be all better off . 
  and then we can all pretend there 's not a refugee crisis going on , like before 2015 . 
  are they ? 
  yeah they went through croatia instead . 
  great help in the bigger picture . 
  it 's the impossibility of irony on the internet . 
  it was n't the refugee crisis that made orban putins 's best eu buddy . 
  probably not . 
  those mad constitution judges decide on whatever they feel , especially in germany . 
  since it 's inception brasil has portuguese immigration . 
  that 's not the case now , since the fall in oil prices and other commodities angola and brasil are no longer viable emigration options for most portuguese emigrants . 
  here in portugal every time there 's a friday 13ths there 's a festival of natural medicine and occult magic headed by a village priest . 
  in what way are the v4 countries helping ? 
  apart from building a wall like hungary . 
  half of those crying for toleration of the ndp do n't even know the history of german militant democracy . 
  the fact they equate this as an attack to freedom tells a lot . 
  are you aware that the first party to be illegalized in then west germany was the communist party ? 
  could you tell how is denying openly neonazi parties public funding the same as putting people in concentration camps ? 
  the npd is still a legal party . 
  yeah that 's just not true . 
  in my country and in goa the inquisition burned people at the stake , exiled them or denied them basic human decency . 
  but good effort of whitewashing their crimes , maybe you could apply the same apologia to the crimes made in name of islam . 
  i can also see that sjw or feminazi exploded last years , does n't mean they 're serious concepts ( especially if they 're only used online ) . 
  i 'm mostly thinking about the reformation or the inquisition . 
   the constitutional court said in january the npd 's aims , viewed by germany 's intelligence agency as racist , anti-semitic and revisionist , violated the constitution . 
   `` the npd intends to replace the existing constitutional system with an authoritarian national state that adheres to the idea of an ethnically defined ` people 's community ' , '' the court said .
