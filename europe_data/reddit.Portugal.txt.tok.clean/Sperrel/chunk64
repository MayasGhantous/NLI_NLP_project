   even the carnation revolution was more about soldiers being discriminated in their carreers than it was about freedom . 
  the trigger for the beginning was that but soon after the mfa agreed that the revolution was to liberate the country and stop the war . 
  it 's absolutely disgusting how even young people believe the tales from the dictatorship . 
  in second place was the historic communist party leader \u00c1lvaro cunhal . 
  as you can see the nation 's view on historical personalities is inherently linked to televoting . 
  as an authoritarian quasi-fascist dictator . 
  with the right constitutional provisions ( like an investiture vote by a majority or a constructive vote of no confidence ) you can have a stable parliament without going back to the iv republic . 
  they 've been doing the same since the 30s : attend left-wing protests , counter-protest the far-right and the occasional fight with the police . 
  apart from it not much . 
  antifa are fringe movements that are actually quite widespread in some european countries ( afterall they started here ) . 
  they do not censor right-wing politics , they engage with the neonazis and other far-right spin offs . 
  suffice to say that they have close to zero influence on the media or the state . 
  i do n't have to give any solution nor am i the right person for it . 
  but voluntarism coupled with an extremist impetus to act is the way to destroy any notion of rule of law and presumption of innocence . 
  sorry mate i 'm not politically correct , it 's racist and to deny calling it propaganda is irony overload . 
  sure i never said that was n't the case . 
  it 's a shame how people can think that the world is n't more complex than assigning boxes to ill defined groups . 
  i acknowledge lots of muslims have deep issues with equals rights and lgbt issues but then again i do n't fool myself that there are n't numerous western citizens ( religious or not ) that are close to those beliefs . 
  now condemning all muslims because part of them do n't have liberal values does n't do much than please our own europeans that do n't care for liberal values ( as otherwise they would n't propose mass deportations or the end of religious freedom ) . 
  a racist analogy but effective propaganda . 
  yeap another example of what does n't happen in a liberal democracy . 
  the road to authoritarianism is paved with good intentions . 
  we can see you 're a simple men the moment you describe millions of persons both in and out of europe as poisonous snakes . 
  do you have any example without resorting to american college politics ? 
  comrade corbyn here we go !, 
  man linking fado to portugal and flamenco to spain is like telling a brazilian they all eat picanha or a german they all wear lenderhosen . 
  yeah it is . 
  ok use whatever you want , it does n't take away the fact that the truth is plastered on this thread . 
   it 's a concept of nationality steming from history of post-colonial societies in new world . 
  we have our own concept of nationality , which is related to ones culture and ethnicity , and a separate concept of citizenship . 
  changing this well-established concept steming from our historical circumstances into some alien and foreign concept would be the worst kind of cultural appropriation . 
  not really , that might be true for the americas but not modern day europe . 
  the current conception is rooted on a deep sense of learning the consequences of nationalism as well as ensuring the promises of equality of all before the law . 
  your conception of an ethnic chauvinism is still rooted in outdated view on the human condition . 
  there 's nothing more of cultural appropriation than that view of thinking that people who are polish are less of it because they do n't make part of the ethnic majority , it 's a view of thinking they 're guest when they have every right to claim poland as their country too . 
   some of them are , and some of them disagree with you . 
  the exact proportion also being polish varies in each ethnicity . 
  again ethnicity does n't matter a thing , even if they feel it does . 
  well i completely understand your position that i believe it 's shared among all poles . 
  but the modern western conception of nationality and ethnicity ( that i agree with ) passed well beyond the positions you seem to believe in , it 's at a stage where ethnicity does n't have any legal and ideological meaning . 
  so for example being portuguese or french means only being a citizen of said countries . 
  that 's how you get someone like leo varadkar or manuel valls . 
   obviously there are romani who happen to be polish citizens , just like there happen to be belarusian , lemko or silesian people who happen to be polish citizens . 
  of course !, 
  that 's why they are polish like ethnic poles . 
  a lot of them are also regulars to the sub , it 's not like the majority of them ( at least those with a flair ) are brigading . 
  they 're just propagandizing their reaccionary worldview . 
  afterall the internet it 's the biggest breeding ground for almost every type of extremist . 
  why are you throwing me / int / and / pol / memes as if it 's in any way credible ? 
  those roma are polish whether you like or not . 
  yeap alt-right memes do n't apply to the discussion . 
  no , this whole conversation is how apparently some polish users do n't understand that the ethnic make up of modern societies is n't in any mean linked to ethnicity . 
  that 's why they are so vehemently denying that there are roma who happen to be polish as if there is a danger of tainting their country 's prestige . 
  ah but they are polish due to the fact that they 're polish citizens . 
  their ethnic affinity is irrelevant . 
  that 's a good counterexample . 
  i 'll concede on that point . 
  not interested tough :(, 
  nope at least my position has the support of even the polish state . 
  people of different ethnicities are polish , what 's the counterexample ? 
  no , polish is bounded by being a polish citizen . 
  if you want to refer to ethnicity then you have to specify . 
  but my opinion is objectively right . 
  nowadays the only thing that can decide who 's polish and who is n't is the polish state , and due to it 's non discriminatory citizenship laws anyone can be polish even if they just got their polish citizenship last month . 
  exactly . 
  those are n't polish because they do n't have polish citizenship and those who would prefer to not be polish but still retain the citizenship are still polish . 
  i 'm not arguing about who 's a pole but on who 's polish . 
  and the only answer to that is people who have citizenship from poland . 
  ** polish ** adjective 1 . of , relating to , or characteristic of poland , its inhabitants , or their language . 
  another one : ** pole ** noun 1 . 
  a native or inhabitant of poland , or a person of polish descent . 
  because polish means polish citizen , amazing right ? 
  i do , i just do n't agree with it and rightfully understand that 's an outdated belief . 
  you do n't understand my only point . 
  any conception of citizenship bounded by being part of an ethnic group is devout of any meaning . 
  this is also the way things work in poland so that 's how people who are roma can also be polish . 
  as in people from poland : polish . 
  not to the rest of the world . 
  he 's yet another right-wing party leader without being gay or with indian ancestry . 
  they 're cool if you have low expectations , 
  mate if you do n't understand more advanced terminology it 's not my problem . 
   to you , but not to me . 
  coolia , but the version i consider the only legitimate is the one that the majority of the democratic and developed world uses . 
  even the polish state is more aligned with my position than your ethnic chauvinism . 
  of course they 're not like any other citizen , they have their own cultural and social traditions . 
  but they 're entitled to them since poland is n't a an ethnodemocracy . 
  so in the end they 're legally ( the only definition that matters ) as polish as ethnic poles . 
  so in poland the younger generations are more right-wing than older generations ? 
  it 's not a fetish but a symbol of change in society . 
  it 's also important to understand why it 's noteworthy . 
  oh you 're doingthe routine of using appropriate terminology in a different context , got it . 
  polish roma are polish like any other citizen of poland . 
  so they 're polish . 
  thanks for clearing up . 
  i ca n't consider it reasonable if it does n't have at least a coherent reasoning to back it up . 
  saying that it looks close enough it 's deplorable knowing the majority of political choices in the eurozone are made according to targets . 
  i suppose they 'll let each mep make their own mind and join their preferred euparl group . 
  if they do then it 's only showing how the party does n't stand for nothing instead of following macron . 
  the thing is that you can already have tactical vote in the first round . 
  for example a member of eelv can tactically vote for ps or fi in order to have them in the final round instead of risking not having anyone from the left .
