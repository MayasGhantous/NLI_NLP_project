while only a small part of the speech , arguing that the movement of migrants to europe could be compared to the reverse process ( movement of europeans to another country ) and calling it colonialism is incredibly misleading . 
  colonialism involved the power of an invading minority to impose policies over the resident majority , hardly what 's happening in europe right now , at most the mass migration to europe is forcing changing policies in several countries in a need to adapt to new circumstances , but at least they are self-imposed . 
  even cartoon network is dubbed nowadays , which is sad since it was one of my first sources for learning english growing up :\\, 
  well , first of all it 's definitely worth watching , some episodes are better than others but the bar never goes below `` good '' . 
  the show is about the exploration of technology in relation to human nature , so it can get pretty depressing at times , but it 's also incredibly thoughtful with it 's subject matter and it does have some lighter moments . 
  you do n't really have to follow the episodes by number so if you want to give it a try i would recommend starting with my personal favorite , season 2 , ep .1 : `` be right back '' with hayley atwell and domhnall gleeson , just because i loved the story and they are both amazing in that episode . 
  to be fair my only personal agenda on the subject was to show people that black mirror is becoming a reality and we should destroy all technology while we can . 
  / unsubscribe cod facts, 
  not sure if you are making a joke , but i more often grill or roast meat than fry it :| also i was mostly associating it to the american tendency of deep-frying stuff . 
  i had no idea the schnitzel ( obviously not called this in portugal ) originated from austria , i thought it was another `` we must fry everything ! '', 
  thing from the americans ... goddammit now i 'm hungry ... 
  it 's been demonstrated that most big social changes in societies are generational , as in they only occur from one generation to another , so yes , it 's not `` we now have gay rights so everyone is accepting of them '' but more about having an entire generation living in a context where gay rights exist and it 's perceived as normal for them . 
  i say gay rights but the same happened to every other big social issue . 
  even though i applaud the initiative i feel these programs are still way behind in informing and helping people that suffer from domestic violence , this includes both women and men , common phrases like `` entre marido e mulher n\u00e3o se mete a colher '' ( ~ `` you do n't put your spoon between man and wife '' ) reinforce the idea that what happens between couples in their home is their business even if you know one is being abused . 
  i know too many situations when the person abused has very little options that allow him/her to leave the abuser , i knew a woman that was beaten and threatened with a knife in front of her kids and even though she went to the police and charged him with abuse , she still had to wait a month to go to court and every single time during that period the abusive husband would change her mind and promise everything would be ok . we need a better implementation of this systems and try to assist as fast as possible the people instead of throwing them back to the same shitty situation they are trying to escape .

  nice , easy access to irish beer , i think we all approve this decision !, 
  max dexterity instead of intelligence and you should be fine, 
  the issue in portugal is that bullfighting is strongly associated with the horse riding community , which is strangely big in portugal ( or i just know too many people who horse ride on an amateur and professional level < _ < ) , they have been campaigning against the ban here . 
  i know many people like them , they all have a weird sense of guilt for our government 's involvement in middle eastern wars or just have no realistic idea of domestic political issues , which i find respectable , but the way they try to change this is just too in your face and illogical , case in point ; my anti-capitalist communist housemate that wants to destroy the `` establishment '' and protect the poor syrians , while spending 800 $ on the latest iphone and only buying apple products like it 's his religion . 
  there 's a ton of discount flights for like 20 $ -30 $ from porto to london , i 've been in more expensive train rides , this is n't the 1950 's flying is n't for the `` elites '' unless you think the average european is part of the `` elite '' ... which i think it 's what they are trying to do . 
  sintra - [ romantic hideout ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5np7jln7n0c ) a great place for you go blind and explore on your own . 
  coimbra - [ the city of students ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xll902x8p94 ) , a small city with one of europe 's oldest university , great night life and very accessible to turists since it 's an university city with a big erasmus community . 
  a\u00e7ores - [ one of our archipelagos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6aqvhw7ljs ) , it 's very different from the mainland , but probably one of the most beautiful regions , if not the most beautiful . 
  i also need to mention our capital cities [ lisbon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pljfkzwrhre ) and [ porto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnjdh1rmhcs ) , or i might be killed ... 
  but are n't most of the attacks being done by 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants that get `` radicalized '' , it 's a bigger issue than `` we are getting all this immigrants and their are fucking shit up '' , it 's people that lived in europe for years or their entire life . 
  i usually describe negatively portugal for being boring and nothing ever happening here , no extreme weather , no mass shootings and other stuff like that , i 'm fine with that fact now :|, 
  well a british financial crisis will probably impact the financial stability of other european countries and i do n't think anyone is excited by that , paying attention to the possible emerging negative effects of brexit is a natural reaction since it affects every european more than any positives aspects , even if some truly just want to see the uk burn , as a portuguese with already many friends living and working in the uk i do n't share the feeling . 
  can confirm , can hear people getting drunk ... others have papers to write though v.v, 
  i think it 's because his personality just makes international political discussions harder than they could be , it 's the same fear most have with a possible trump president . 
  yeah i know , i only heard about it thanks to [ roman mars 's ted talk about flags ] ( https://youtu.be/pnv5ikb2hl4?t=10m51s ), 
  they do n't know anything though , [ milwaukee has the best flag in the world and they hate it ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dvgc9uyd--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1413035434213021474.png ), 
  it 's weird i rarely see the iberian peninsula without our borders , we look pretty , i motion a vote for the creation of the iberian union , with the iberian lynx as our official symbol !, 
  he means that most modern christians view the bible from a modern western society viewpoint , they are more likely to adapt they religious beliefs to what we perceive as `` normal '' in our society than the other way around . 
  like the homosexual debate , most modern christians appear to be ok with it nowadays and `` god says love is love '' even though a couple of decades ago it was a `` sin '' according to the christian doctrine . 
  to be fair civ 6 is my first civ , and i suck at it , but it 's really fun to play casually . 
  i always rush it when i can just because it makes my city look prettier . 
  did you see the intro for this show ? 
  it looks exactly like the expanse intro sequence < _ <, 
  / r/portugal seems pretty divided on having eder there or not according to the pool , the image seems pretty finished right now though . 
  not only active member states but this is also exactly what all anti-eu parties are hoping for . 
  if uk actually gets a good deal , expect a lot of propaganda from parties of both extremes of the political spectrum , that 's gon na be fun . 
  i was arguing against saying that the usa and russia are incomparable when it comes to democracy and freedom of speech . 
  both countries just utilize different means of controlling their population for their own self-interests , russia is just more direct and blatant with it . 
  putting the us on a pedestal in comparison to russia is straight hypocrisy, 
  | united states of america - 693 prisoners per 100.000 population | russia - 450 prisoners per 100.000 population please lets not pretend that the us does n't have a fucked up penal system and it 's all about defending `` democracy '' and freedom of speech , the difference between russia and the us is just different shades of government manipulation . 
  i never said it was illegal , just anti-democratic . 
  also this was the first election i actually followed and honestly your entire electoral system is fucked up , i honestly do n't understand how people allow such a system to exist , it 's like representation is the last objective of the american electoral system . 
  so you are telling me that super delegates are n't extremely anti-democratic ? 
  i think they mean that wikileaks targeted directly the hilary campaign with the dnc emails and the podesta emails , because it would be more beneficial for them for hilary to lose . 
  not advocating against it , since those emails showed how fucked up the democratic party was , but like we are seeing now , the trump campaign also had its share of dirt ( mostly connections to russia ) but wikileaks choose to ignore it and focus on hurting the hilary campaign exclusively . 
  well , not really the type of jobs i think we need but ... hey buddy dur\u00e3o barroso , throw us a bone will ya ? 
  damn , the first one looks like something an angsty teen would do in the early 2000s if he had actual talent , instead of doing a naruto amv like most . 
  does anyone know if people seeking irish residency increased this year , it would make sense as an alternative ... and they have better beer . 
  it 's not like we have much to complain , we are already one of the countries with fewest refugees and recently they announced that 1/3 of the refugees we accepted bailed on us , left the country and nobody knows where they are . 
  the situation in portugal is vastly different than central european countries . 
  the most standard speed right now i think is 100mb down/up , this might change obviously according to where you are and what hotspots/wifi you use . 
  it 's not korea 's level of mega super hyperspeed internet though . 
  not your fault , no idea why amadora is considered a city even in wikipedia , i 've always seen it as a huge urbanization where people that work in lisbon live , maybe it received the designation for some particular reason . 
  amadora , like many other areas near it , is pretty much still part of what could be considered lisbon , it 's only large in the sense of it 's population living there , since most work in the metropolitan area of lisbon . 
  it 's a commuter town ( til this is an actual term ) . 
  nu mexico , a fusion of shitty old mexico with a pussy version of new mexico . 
   part of being a parent is teaching children what the parent thinks is best i 'm sorry but i strongly disagree with this for many reasons , but to simplify i can use the current anti-vaccination issue in the us as an example as to how that mode of thinking is wrong and somewhat dangerous . 
  i was baptized and forced into a religion as a young kid , it did n't work for me but that fact still feels like a sort of violation of my identity , mostly because it was used against me by my grandparents when i said i was n't religious . 
  my cousin decided by herself to be baptized at age 12 , it was her choice , i much prefer her parents approach . 
  portugal is finally first place in something . 
  i 'll get the celebratory beer boys !, 
  that stupid [ 1:50 long sex scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxeq7e8ro6y ) was 1:40 seconds too long , it was cringy and not even visually interesting , at least in the [ graphic novel it was short and it had better done `` symbolism '' ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/af/26/72/af2672fd7daea3981159545d483a2dfa.jpg ), 
  i have a love/hate relationship with that movie , that scene exemplifies my exact problem with it , zack snyder is a really really great visual director , but he destroys almost every other aspect of his movies , his dialogue scenes look amateurish at best when compared with other modern great directors out there , fincher being an obvious example ... i 'll run back to r/movies sorry fun sidenote : solid snake wrote the script for the movie, 
  to be fair , i 'm pretty sure the `` flower power '' movement and giving flowers to soldiers/armed forces happened way before the 25 de abril . 
  there 's also the possibility of just decriminalising heavy drugs , this takes away the stigma associated with it from the consumer and allows people to seek help . 
  it also allows for special clinics to exist that provide the consumers with safe spaces for them to consume drugs while allowing health specialists to monitor them and have direct access if they want to seek help . 
  in the end i personally believe that legalising heavy drugs should only happen if the state is willing to create ( or help create ) safe spaces for them to be consume if the people ( +18 responsible adults obviously ) want to . 
  if someone wants to snort cocaine they can always do it illegally , or we could create spaces where they will be taken care of if something goes wrong . 
  this method works with prostitution , it should also be implemented with drugs . 
  are you honestly arguing that youtube comments are the pinnacle of diverging opinions ? 
  next you will tell me if i want to know how other people really think i should read facebook comments and news websites comment sections ... 
  just install [ alientube ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alientube-for-youtube/opgodjgjgojjkhlmmhdlojfehcemknnp ) , it shows comments from reddit threads where the video was posted , it 's also pretty neat if you like finding new subs, 
  as much as i appreciate this sub and videos like this one , it also makes me notice how differently some europeans behave towards other european countries outside of this sub . 
  people tend to be much more antagonistic nowadays , and not in the jokey way that people are usualy in here :\\, 
  yes i know :\\ that 's why i said i understand why it still exists from a political standpoint , the lack of interest in politics is why i usually hate talking about it with people , it 's almost always meaningless ... and now i 'm sounding like my communist housemate that calls democracy a failed experiment . 
  on a sidenote , does canada suffer from something similar to how ridiculous gerrymandering is in the us ? 
  changing it to a single transferable vote system would n't change much about the way people vote nor the type of government and would make it slightly more `` representative '' , we are asking adults to vote not first-graders , if people are confused it 's the governments job to provide ways to access information and people to inform themselves before they vote ... but that 's more a cultural issue in some countries ( portugal included ) than anything else . 
  but yes , when it comes to american politics i would n't know even were to start , that thing should be the definition of clusterfuck of a government based on fptp . 
  i honestly do n't understand how fptp is still a thing ... well i understand it being enforced in a political sense because it keeps the 2 major parties always trading control between each other , but from the common people 's perspective it already feels bad to see your preferred political party lose majority control , but it must feel awful that you also have zero political representation in your country . 
  that actually sounds a lot like hamilton 's [ cabinet battle # 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1xjcztdt8 ) and [ cabinet battle # 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rri37yaml4q ) , but with less rhyming , very well edited . 
  meh , we will probably be added during the the african kingdoms expansion . 
  food is pretty cheap in big commercial chains , but small family meat/fish stores are also incredibly cheap if you find the right ones ( this might change from city to city ) , almost everything else changes according to what you want and specific brands , case in point , asus has a pretty good relationship here so you can find their products at cheaper prices than similar products , gas is pretty expensive but any of the bigger cities has cheaper alternatives in their public transportation infrastructure . 
  [ you can see more stats here ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=portugal ), 
  even if everyone voted there 's way more 35 + people voting than under 35 thanks to current demographics were most european countries have an ageing population . 
  democracy is controlled by the dying generation , no wonder people do n't bother to vote . 
  to be fair our president 's function is more like an higher level diplomat than a world leader . 
  i think a\u00e7orda \u00e0 alentejana would probably be the closest to `` soup sandwich '' < _ <, 
  at this point i really do n't want to see portugal in international news , 9 out of 10 times its about the country literally burning somewhere . 
  ... the 1 out of 10 was some uni guys that made a new ai mod for skyrim , i guess that 's cool . 
   evil league of evil .
