  a wall to stop the brown walkers, 
  it worked in the night of the long knives and it has been doing wonders to putins popularity . 
  she 's an ethnic dane you dimwit , and there is freedom of religion in denmark , so i think she already choose one of those countries . 
  yet, 
  in soviet countries old people are nostalgic for stalinist times , in the u.s. they are nostalgic for the 50 's , in portugal for the dictatorship of salazar , does that mean that we should go back to those days , or that their lives were better than they are now ? 
  of course not , they are just victims of rosy retrospection . 
  that might or not might not be the case in the uk , in either way your reason is faulty, 
   involves working more with the commonwealth what stops you from doing it now ? 
  did n't said otherwise , but calling yourself a majority is ridiculous, 
   it is not your way , it is the majorities way . 
  37.6 % is now a majority ? 
  it is indeed opressive and i think we should change it, 
  if the catholic church is true , then they practice canibalism in every mass , canibalism is anti european . 
  if the catholic church is false then they are lying , lying is anti european , 
  headscarves are everywhere in traditional womens clothings around europe , how is that anti-european , and what about the nuns , are they also anti european ? 
  are n't headscarves part of [ traditional bulgarian cloths ?

   draw the line there where christians will not be affected but muslims will be you 're [ wrong ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9136191/christians-have-no-right-to-wear-cross-at-work-says-government.html ), 
  of course it can happen , it 's happening right at this moment , people can belive what ever the stupid shit they want as long as they dont go against the law . 
  no country should aspire to be unicultural , the only country today that can claim to be that is north korea . 
  that would be all fine and dandy if it was always superstitious cretins using them , but in truth that is not the case , many are coherced to use [ them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gzcfdhkd4a ), 
  multiculturalism is tolerating the value systems of other cultures and letting them exist alongside one another as long as they respect the law of the country , it 's not letting a bunch of nitwits create their own courts parallel to the legal ones and exert a humongous social pressure to be the only ones used . 
  no it 's not , do you have any idea of how high are the the legal expenses associated with condemning someone to death ? 
  it 's more thanks to the internet than anything else , do n't pride yourself too hard for the sucess of the u.s. 
   m5s , neither left or right , just wrong how about this for their new slogan, 
  it 's a bit more difficult for them , they use fptp, 
  the misrepresentation comes after the quoting , stop acting like an idiot , this sub wo n't take your crap, 
  s\u00e1pmi independence when ? 
  that 's one way of looking at this , the other is that terrorists are so desperate now that it is getting hard to distinguish them from reckless drivers . 
  and no one is saying this is the * good * alternative , this is a tragedy regardless of the perpetrator 's intentions . 
   no muslim ever stepped a foot in galicia i know a turk who went there last summer, 
  i 'm with you 140 %, 
   he said , speaking in german . 
  he also speaks german ?!, 
  is there any european language that he does n't speak ? 
  `` works '', 
  not many suicide bombers in hungary either , and i would n't be so sure about no women being raped back then, 
  and even after he is in charge , his mindless supporters and their stupid ideas would continue to be the cancer they are now to turkish society, 
  miss pen , petty putin 's putain misses petain, 
  the dutch to the luxembourgeoise : bitch i bought this dress first, 
  well the island of lesbos is in southern europe ... 
  have you just assumed that women ca n't be womanisers ? 
  you clearly have no idea of [ what the single market is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6f0inyjpdc&amp;index=34&amp;t=1s&amp;list=llocbjmfu1mqx-msgiud-atw ), 
  huh ... would you look at the time , have to go ... huh ... salt the cod, 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanking_massacre ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_731 ), 
  you 're not very sharp , are you ? 
  when you were in school would your teachers refer to you as being `` special '' ? 
   sangre what 's that ? 
  such is life in latvia, 
  i dare you to say that [ this ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/276/2499/1600/1071221803-0b.jpg ) is n't true devotion, 
  we 're all netherlands on this blessed day !, 
  fillon is a mess !, 
  fillon is a big fat mistake !, 
  fillon is a waste and everybody knows it !, 
  such a nasty guy !,

  what have we done to deserve such a thing ? 
  maybe because it 's none of our business . 
  what you are asking makes as much sense as asking where was the israeli indignation on / r/israel when dilma rousseff was ousted from the brazilian presidency . 
  why no discussion of south american politics on / r/israel ? 
  joke 's on you , most of these companies are not profiting ... yet, 
  the portuguese dictatorship was n't supported by the us, 
  feels bad man :'(, 
  thank god that in france you ca n't get to be president with only 25 %, 
   uk and the us will be the only countries that got stuck with nationalistic populists you forgot poland, 
  we have the best donalds , do n't we folks ? 
  do n't be a popis pants and ruin the joke, 
  killing the dead is too good a punishment for those degenerates , i say we should bury them in tiny boxes till they rot , burn them to a crisp or use them in medical experiments, 
  it kinda looks like an empire tough , and according to this map rome is part of it , and we do n't know the exact day of the year 1000 this map is supposed to represent , maybe it is an hollyday . 
  no amount of military spending would have kept ukraine safe, 
  v4 talks the talk , but does it walk the walk ? 
  charming, 
  of course it is , one of the biggest, 
  no shit !, 
  what do you mean sources ? 
  is n't the word of the sultan good enough for you ? 
  not everything that is not `` super okay '' is a genocide . 
  you 're making a false dichotomy, 
  so much for pro life, 
  wtf finland , portugal was a bona fide world empire back then , you are n't even a real country . 
  about spain , bloody hell !, 
  i can certainly get along with a good ol' spain bashing , but this is just vicious , one would think that by being in such a cold environment you would have a bit more chill, 
  they might only get a few seats , but per capita their vote is one of the most powerful, 
  why did you send dementia pacient to the european parliament ? 
  he should be in a nursing home getting some treatment , this is cruel and unusual punishment to the old man . 
  bring him home to his family so they can take care of him , they must be worried sick . 
  why are you so cruel to the sick poland , why ? 
  that 's a bingo !, 
  i 'm sure you are a pedophile and a rapist , my proof , the entire history of mankind . 
  this does n't stick , does it ? 
  do you have anything more concrete or can i just dismiss you as a lunatic ? 
  marvel yourself at the [ glory of lunacy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jsxs5_mofy ) , if you understand the language , my dear sombrero friend, 
  luxury , here taxi drivers are known for saying that little girls are to be raped, 
   under international law , refuges are supposed to go to the first safe country they can any source on that ? 
  i just saw the getting `` escorted '' out of the `` no go zone '' , and it showed absolutely nothing , it 's just him in an not bad looking area talking to the guy that 's with him and then claiming that the police told them to get out for their safety , we do n't see or even hear the police talking to them , we do n't hear the screams that he claims were thrown at him in the end of the video , we do n't see them being attacked . 
  terrible jornalism . 
  and the no go zones were n't supposed to be called like that because the police was afraid to go there ? 
  how come we see the police there ? 
  do you have proof otherwise ? 
  it 's not cause the sitting politicans are virtuous , it 's because the judiciary is independant from the executive,
