  of course you got access denied , what part of portugal 's exclusive zone do n't you get , 
  thanks , do you have anything in english ? 
  i 'm having some dificulties finding, 
  who have they killed ? 
  when poland sends it 's mp 's ... 
  ... ein anzug you would think a mep would earn enough to buy more than one suit, 
  like static on the tv, 
  if that 's the case , you just found a market to explore , go for it get rich, 
  what do you mean join the club ? 
  you 're the founder, 
  we had some bad hobres here :(, 
  extreme vetting !, 
  there is fern\u00e3o de magalh\u00e3es but if we put a picture of him nobody would know who he is , his face simply is n't known as much as the face of this portuguese chemist napole\u00e3o boaparte, 
  nico do telhado , the cousin of z\u00e9 do telhado, 
  as a portuguese i feel honored to see these subreddits honoring one of our most known carthographers nicolau rodrigues de s\u00e1 tesla, 
  i 've altered the [ deal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpe_xmricle ), 
  silly emus , think they can trick anyone by calling themselves ostriches , the austrian people will have their vengence, 
  do n't know , the police does n't reveal how many of the convicted killers are le pen supporters , they might be hidding something, 
   how does le pen plan on integrating them into society ? 
  by banning them from [ school ] ( http://time.com/4595003/marine-le-pen-ban-children-illegal-immigrants-school/ ) of course, 
   `` i sure wish malloch was here with us '' -- no one ever, 
  oh , sorry , i misread . 
  about le pen , she is despised cause she is the candididate of the extreme right , the party that she is heading the front nationale used to be lead by her father , a complete fascist bonkers . 
  the party used to be irrelevant until she started heading it she had a public spat with her father and did a makeover to it , she brought a fresh face to it and cut the most downright nazi stuff from it . 
  some say that the change was just a cosmetic make over and that she continues to hold the same views as her father , since he is still funding her . 
  i personaly despise every thing that the party stands for , but not only that , she is the biggest hypocrite that you can find , she says she is for law and order yet she is being investigated for [ fraud ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/20/marine-le-pen-front-national-headquarters-raided-by-police ) , and [ this ] ( https://euobserver.com/institutional/136944 ) , she claims to be a political outsider , yet she 's been at it for years and she 's from a literal political dinasty , she claims to be a nationalist patriot , yet she 's in the [ pocket of an hostile foreign leader ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/le-pen-russia-crimea-putin-money-bank-national-front-seeks-russian-cash-for-election-fight/ ) , making her a [ traitor ] ( http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/marine-le-pen-la-russie-pousserait-sa-candidature-selon-la-dgse-7787143387 ) , and a [ puppet ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/02/01/france-intv-amanpour-marine-le-pen-b.cnn ) , she promised to [ pull france out of eu , euro , and nato ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/presidentielles/2017/02/05/35003-20170205livwww00044-en-direct-le-meeting-de-marine-le-pen-a-lyon-la-video-le-discours-les-reactions.php ) , and is [ throughout a despicable person ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=le+pen&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ), 
  why are you going to be voting for that party ? 
  why ? 
  why do you hang around in the t_d ? 
  what do you mean by indulging in averages ? 
  why not ? 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  what decisions has brussels been making that are against their party line ? 
  holy shit !, 
  it 's confirmed , spaniards are periquites, 
  what 's wrong with d66 ? 
  i was told the hate is caused because germans [ dig holes on their beaches ] ( https://imgur.com/beqz2xr ) and steal their bikes, 
  we 're all netherlands on this blessed day, 
  it 's quite possible that since this episode to now she has said some idiotic crap with no basis in reality as usual , so i will play safe and just say she was extreme right , with the possibility of her being now in a state alternative to being right some kind of alt-right if you prefer, 
  it 's the `` truth '' and you know it , he 's never wrong , he 's just alt-right, 
  no puppet , no puppet , you 're the puppet, 
  as much as i despise her i have to say , she was extremely right, 
  what kind of barbarian goes to mcdonald 's to get coffe anyway ? 
  come on man , [ are you even trying ? 
  ] ( http://www.europe1.fr/politique/affaire-theo-marine-le-pen-demande-linterdiction-des-manifestations-contre-la-police-2981624 ), 
  if that was the reason , my parish police , the polish , the ukranian , the latvian , the lithuanian , the nigerian , the north korean and serbian police would not have a tendency to be authoritarian , that is not the case , the police forces generally have a bigger tendency than the general public to go for the authoritarian . 
  this happens everywhere in the world regardless of the number of migrants . 
  do you know of any authoritarian regime in which the security forces are not well treated ? 
  neither do the security forces ... 
  wall , and make the pesetas pay for it, 
  for that sweet sweet sweet authoritah, 
  if she said that [ i could not be criticized in my work and that i am unaccontable ] ( http://www.europe1.fr/politique/affaire-theo-marine-le-pen-demande-linterdiction-des-manifestations-contre-la-police-2981624 ) , giving me a carte blanche to do whatever i want i would be loving her too, 
  what !!!!? 
  it happened yesterday too ? 
  2 days in a row , at this point it would be more humane to just to drop a nuclear bomb in stockholm and end their suffering for once !, 
  wow spain , you 're on a roll , as in rolling down the hill to the bottom cause you suck jajajajajaajajjaajajjaa, 
  hahahahaahhaahahahahahaah it would be even worse without catalonia , galicia and the basques, 
  the flag , they choose the wrong one and now are n't alowed in the nordic group, 
  [ get amazed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omj-4b-ms-y ), 
  see , you 're terrible at math, 
  learn the math spain , you suck . 
  there is a poem by fernando pessoa that says all the salt in the sea are portuguese tears . 
  that means we have a claim to the entire world supply of salt , it 's ours not yours , now go eat your schnitzel insipidly . 
  the only regulation that should be made is regarding product safety . 
  quality policing is up to the consumer, 
  a lot , i have a bad habit of losing my keys, 
  but why would they do that , companies adapt their products for local markets , for example in portugal some brands usually use more salt when compared to other countries , is it to make worse quality food or is it just an adaptation to local taste ? 
  when i was studying in andalucia i noticed that there were moroccans everywhere and i thought i might be in danger , till one night i got pretty drunk and almost got in a fight , when i woke up the next day i realised i was not in danger , i was the danger, 
  what a shame , he had so much promise at breaking wind, 
  you 're joking , but russia [ has been doing something like that ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/georgia-border-russia-vladimir-putin-213787 ), 
  many jesuits were doing exactly that, 
  yeah , 200 years ago ... algeria only got his independence in the sixties, 
  someone has to break big wind . 
  is mister geert wilders available ? 
  do you have evidence that proves otherwise ? 
  not really , turkey and russia were great conquerors and now are complete shit . 
  while switzerland , finland , luxembourg , norway , iceland and ireland are some of the most prosperous countries out there and are as peaceful a country can be . 
   white americans commit violent crimes at approximately the same rate as ( white ) europeans . 
  yeah , you 're talking from your ass , you do n't have the number of crimes committed just just white europeans cause most countries do n't make a distinction when counting . 
  is that the street that attracts all the hungary migrants ? 
  thanks, 
  do you have a source ? 
  as a chad citizen i feel honored to see this homage to our great nation , thanks my brothers and good luck on your fight, 
  i do n't know if it 's a good thing that he is dying , he did n't stroke me as evil , he stroke as an extremely aware person , and disillusioned because of that . 
  cynicism is too easy a trap to fall into . 
  what a disheartened person . 
  and the worse part is he is right . 
  all the economists ? 
  are you on bath salts ? 
  what a talk !, 
  and from 2011 !, 
  not only an common army is needed , we also need nukes in other countries besides france, 
  throw in a hugo boss shirt and you got yourself a deal, 
  what 's in it for me ? 
  judges . 
  enemies of the ~ ~ state ~ ~ people . 
  whistleblowers . 
  enemies of the ~ ~ state ~ ~ people . 
  48 % of the ~ ~ population ~ ~ people .
