  nop czech republic : 88.5 % non-religious or undeclared 10.4 % roman catholic 1.1 % other, 
  so ... a trade agreement would be great we would buy cheaper , win win, 
  the putin sends his regards, 
  you sell them to latin america , you sell them to africa and you are already selling in southeast asia , their middle class is in this moment expanding at a great rate , this is the perfect time to force more of your crap on their markets,

  til , i just assumed it would be somewhat similar to czech republic , boy , am i surprised !, 
  and now intrigued to know why such a big difference, 
  and both are stereotypes for both their nations, 
  then why spain italy malta and portugal so much higher than estonia latvia and slovakia ? 
  most of i did n't even realize you helped on this blessed day, 
  as far as kitsh goes it could do way worse, 
  why is n't the independent banned ? 
  wtf , i like merkel now, 
  confirmation bias is a disease of everything that breaths, 
  see, 
   russia rules with an iron fist . 
  muslims in russia are , besided the secularization campaign of the soviets , not allowed to openly threaten russia . 
  bullshit , there have been lots of attacks by chechens, 
  you , are thinking of nationalism, 
  wtf i like bannon now jk fuck that guy, 
  lebanon , jordan and turkey have taken a huge part of the refugees , if i am not mistaken , lebanon alone has more syrian refugees that all of europe combined . 
  saudi arabia is a piece of shit , i do n't think they will help anyone , besides why would syrians try to run to a theocracy , where they would be treated as slaves , it 's like saying that if a war broke out i should be looking for refuge in best korea , cause they are atheist too . 
  she 's as crooked as a 300 k euros bill, 
  calm down mate , that guy is not wrong , he 's just alt-right, 
   the supreme authority over sweden is not the swedish supreme court but the european court of justice . 
  it 's neither , the supreme authority in sweden is the swedish people, 
  i think he is schulz trying to test our faith, 
  the other day my friend was punched in the face by a guy from a neighboring town , is it my fault that he got punched cause i agree that we should not exclude people from the other guy 's town ? 
   if we as a society are going to say that one person is so far gone , so inhuman , that they should essentially be locked away and forgotten forever , than honestly , what 's the difference between putting a bullet in the back of his head ? 
  in my view is not a case of what he deserves or not , it 's a question of whether or not any of us has the right to decide that anyone should die . 
  in my view nobody should have that right . 
  that being said , it does n't mean that we do n't have the right to protect ourselves from him , so prison it is, 
  we are all eastern block people on this blessed day, 
  he asked mexico to pay for it, 
  open your eyes mate , look to the tracks and see , there are no brakes, 
  no escape from the train, 
  no , it 's all bad in the same way , if you have ever touched on the devil 's joystick , you might as well go on full '' [ aristocrats ] ( https://youtu.be/tw10xa_xtng?t=1m27s ) '' with it, 
  oh shit , i have to warn my cousin !, 
  he 's going to get married by the church in a few months but he is sterile . 
  i have to stop him , he is committing a serious sin, 
  then we can come to a solution to the problem you proposed that unelected figure heads should stay neutral cause you would be mad if they took a position that you disagree . 
  unelected figure heads should stay neutral in the political discourse , unless it is a subject under the scrutiny of empirical science , in which case they can take the opinion of the majority of the experts in the field if in agreement , or stay quiet if in disagreement . 
  of course it 's not going to cure cancer , but for minor problems i do n't think there is a problem, 
  climate change is not a political opinion , is it ? 
  trump is not a successful businessman , his biggest success in the business world was waiting for his father to die, 
  the placebo effect is a real effect , homeopathy can indeed help someone cure themselves . 
  t. alberto barbosa, 
  if it is found out that there were people who voted without being allowed to , there is no way of knowing in who they voted , is there dimwit ? 
  your point is stupid beyond belief , is useless arguing with someone on a troll account . 
  it 's not that your point loses merit , it 's just that the discussion becomes pointless . 
  3 hour old account, 
   it 's usually the other way around lately , putin is guily for everythinh happening in europe and here he is on an one month old account, 
  i thought that the appeal of putin was that he was tough on crime, 
  not if the husband waits a year for the reprisal, 
   repeated voting would definitely not work out in democrats favor who gives a fuck if it goes or not in democrats favor , if the voting was illegitimate in a meaningful way the elections should be repeated , is it not ? 
  i see you have not responded to my question , i ask again , of the things i mentioned which one is an assumption ? 
  and i also have to ask you what 's the good reason for gerrymandering , fpp , voting being on a work day , closing polling stations , straitening the hours polling places are open , felon disenfranchisement , dc residents not represented in congress , voter caging ? 
   you 're blaming trump for electoral college i 'm not  you 're blaming him for a system that was n't put in by him i 'm not  do you realize how dumb it is what you 're saying i do agree that strawmans are quite dumb  let 's see if they decide to investigate voter fraud which liberals are so against if voter fraud is discovered does that not mean that the election was illegitimate and has to be repeated ? 
  voter suppression is not the investigation , voter suppression is what is going to come out of the investigation , is cabinet lies about easily verifiable facts , it 's an absolute certainty that they will lie about uneasily verifiable facts . 
  of the things i mentioned which one is an assumption ? 
  if the majority of people voted for a party and the least voted party gets to control both houses the presidency and soon the supreme court , giving the majority no representation , how is that not a dirty trick ? 
  of course not , if you exclude czechia and hungary , their population combined is probably less than the population of portugal . 
  latvia and lithuania are among the biggest contributors per capita , in one of them conscription is even still active if i 'm not mistaken . 
  what do you expect of countries with just 3 million or less ? 
  who are they ? 
  the reassurance that the agreement stays in place and every country in nato will come in defense of a country attacked is more important than the spending , the us could slash the spending in 3/4 or more if they wanted and it would not make as much damage as trump 's declarations have . 
  that 's where the `` even more '' comes from , one thing that happens now can happen even more in the future, 
  no , its about gerrymandering , fpp , voting being on a work day , closing polling stations , straitening the hours polling places are open , felon disenfranchisement , dc residents not represented in congress , [ voter caging ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_caging ) ... 
  the us is blackmailing a country to which they have a trade agreement . 
  to pay for a wall that will cost dozens of billions to build and even more to maintain . 
  when the emigration from mexico is in a net negative , and when almost all of the migrants arrive by airplane . 
  the crisis created will cause a deep depression on said country , leading to an increase in migration . 
  [ nato is obsolete ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/712969068396093440?lang=en ) , [ and this ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/ ) [ and donald trump calls brexit `` an example of what is to come '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjjxka_zmdg ) and there is also all that lunacy about torture, 
  all this travesty with the wall and mexico for starters , the undermining of nato , the support for the dismantling of the eu , the un envoy that is pledging to take names of those who do n't support us ... 
  these are not the actions of a reliable partner, 
  how can we be sure it will only be 4 years , people like trump have a tendency to be quite sticky , he 's already laying the ground work to suppress the voters even more than they are right now, 
  i think the reason it 's because under ceta canadian companies have to comply with eu regulations when exporting here , under ttip that was n't required of american companies, 
  that might be true until now , but now with the us acting deranged some of them might start to soften their stance, 
  that 's what i said , or at least what i meant to say, 
  true , but it might mean that we are doing something right, 
  even in number of terrorism victims europe is lower than most of the world, 
   sometimes i think europeans deserve all of this because of idiots like you . 
  all of this what ? 
  some of the lowest crime rates in the world , lowest rates of recidivism , lowest percentage of people murdered . 
  sorry if not every place can be a paradise such as somalia, 
  maybe spain is hoarding them all, 
  you should deep fry it afterwards, 
  to be fair that was n't really a question , it was an affirmation, 
  it could do much worse than slovenia , they could get slovakia, 
   and they do n't even try to find a middle ground . 
  there is no middle ground when talking to extremists , some positions are just plain wrong , if you always go for the middle ground one side just has to drift further into extremism to pull everyone with them cause the middle will also be drifting . 
  you do n't go for the middle , you go to the side that is ethical and factual . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pdtifkxgee ), 
   aggression happened before the west threatened to move its military alliance all the way to russia 's border if only russian troops had done the same and stayed in their border . 
  what 's wrong with talks about ukraine joining nato . 
  not that long ago the idea of russia joining nato was being thrown around , it all changed with the attack on georgia . 
  [ not really ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk ) but nice try, 
  nah , just an idiot punching a [ nazi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk ),
