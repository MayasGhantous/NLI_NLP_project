  when switzerland sends its people , they 're not sending their worst . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of solutions , and they 're bringing those solutions to us . 
  they 're bringing chocolate . 
  they 're bringing clocks . 
  they 're gentlemen . 
  and some , i assume , are good money launderers, 
  no true scotsman would say such a thing, 
  you can shitpost and get on the frontpage in r/europe as long as ~ ~ it goes along with the narrative ~ ~ people upvote it, 
  if that happens you should catch them before they leave . 
  to be fair i also think that there is something a bit fishy in this map , i just wanted to know if he had an interesting reason for it since he made the claim, 
  why is it not representative of portugal ? 
  politburo gave us child . 
  politburo took potato , child dead , no problem we eat child . 
  such is life, 
  not wanting to hassle with a baby is a perfetly good reason to have an abortion if it is done on an early stage . 
  we are all very acquainted with the far-left love for free global markets , who can forget that time when stalin adressed the capitalist west after building the berlin wall and said `` mister gorbachev tear down this wall '' . 
   but remaining part of the eu empire means your also an imperialist as well as big business supporter so ... not a leftie, 
  as of now 2 downvotes , the crowd that you are moaning about seems to be huge, 
  what do you mean lefties , anti globalization was always one of the lefts wallmarks . 
  i 'm quite far from being offended , i 'm also very far from seeing humor in here . 
  i just think your justification is absurd . 
  there is no subtlety , there is no wordplay , it 's just an afirmation that people died cause of snow , hard to find that offensive even harder to find it funny . 
   i love provocation and offensive behavior that exposes a groups true face this realy showed us the true face of random people killed by snow . 
  take that avalanche victims , we had enough of your hipocrisy !, 
  whats with the huge crowns and all that gold ?

  he fits extremely right i would say, 
  he did what he could , the us presidency alone does n't have enough power . 
  wonders happen when you directly pay for your press,

  our language is kinda similar , i guess we 're fucked, 
  you 're right , when is russia going to give kaliningrad back to germany ? 
  meh , as far as totalitarism goes , the id issue is as tame as an issue can get, 
  i did n't say they are perfect , and what 's the problem with carrying id , i 'm required to carry id all the time and i 'm not even a foreigner, 
  in my opinion iceland is pretty glorious and to my best knowledge not many tanks and feet marching plowed their land edit : you should also read the rest of the lyrics of the song :  what is the glorious fruit of our land ? 
   its fruit is deformed children  what is the glorious fruit of our land ? 
   its fruit is orphaned children, 
  it 's almost as if in 500 million people you can find more than 2 opinions . 
  weird !, 
  wow !, 
  you are the sole poster in r/shiteuropeanssay . 
  i for some reason think that you could not care less about nato contributions , do you want to open up and tell us what is the true root of your hate ? 
  why do people keep bringing hitler when talking about authoritarians occupying neighbor countries ? 
  yeah , it was posted here some time ago, 
  he 's refering [ to this ] ( https://lgbtqnation-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/2016/10/russian-antigay-propaganda-cartoon.jpg ), 
  they can alway try something in kazakistan, 
   i swear erdogan still around because of fools like you both in turkey and outside . 
  idiots like erdogan are in power cause even bigger idiots put him there, 
   people who do n't hate , do n't lie so ... nobody ? 
  you could come to this side of the border and carry on with the network if you have nothing better to do , we 'll pay in jamon, 
  they all follow putin 's rule book, 
  g-g-gg-g-g-g-gg-ghosts !!!!!!, 
  you would n't be that far from the truth if you were from chechnya , but to the rest of the country things have n't got to that point yet, 
  yeah , it 's very , very , very rare , but still happens and is still a reason to be very shocked , i mean , would n't you be shocked to find out that in mexico they had sacrificed a handful of people in the last decade to quetzalcoatl by ripping their still beating heart out with an sharp rock , or if you found out that in spain in they were still burning people at the stake . 
  i recomend you doing it sooner cause later you wont be able to , and with the amount of information they probably have of you online i do n't think you will want to stay there, 
  do n't be sad , [ cheer up ] ( https://i.redd.it/s5irmo6sbilx.jpg ), 
  no offence , but your best knowledge does n't seem to be that great https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sati_ ( practice ), 
  if by one particular community you mean several of more than just one religion , and if you forget that portugal was everywhere not just in goa , and that it was practised also in goa you would be right, 
  india used to burn widows alive in their husbands funeral pyre , till the portuguese inquisition arrived and started burning everyone . 
  it still happens sometimes, 
  as is suposed to , having a dickless lion on your heraldry was a sign of great dishonor , and it 's a lion , not a lioness, 
  at least luxemburg has an [ badass alternative ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/civil_ensign_of_luxembourg.svg/800px-civil_ensign_of_luxembourg.svg.png ),

  cunt ca n't into kant ?

  and none of them are in spain, 
  or sometimes as ouros ( golds ), 
  yes , it is childish to get enraged with people that join willingly an organization that systematically kills , rapes , tortures and enslaves . 
  the premise was alright , but it could have had a better execution , should had used a sword,

  did you just assume her gender ?!, 
  i would probably call her the same if she was a man . 
  i mean what else would i call someone who runs on a platform of fierce nationalism while being in the pocket of an hostile foreign leader ? 
  not only petain nostalgic , but also putain for putin . 
  edit : or better put : petty putin 's putain le pen pining for petain,

   my parents spanked me all the time when i was little , did n't experience any trauma at all . 
  you are the guy that in another thread said that kadyrov is cool guy . 
  that does n't seem like the kind of thing a sane person would say . 
  the guy who made this is bulgarian , i think, 
  lol a account with only 3 comments guilding itself , pitiful !, 
  you are absolutely right , europeans should declare total war against the biggest nuclear power in order to protect a country that is not part of their alliance . 
  it 's more a question of scale than it is a question of who does what, 
  `` this terror threats sure are terrible , so terrible that we should ban porn '' - the uk stellar logic, 
  they also bring drugs , they bring crime , they 're rapists , some i would assume make good tacos, 
  those are just 2 indicators , although honduras is higher , the score is virtually the same . 
  i 'm not affirming anything , just asking questions . 
  the graph is not to be taken as the defenitive source of understanding which country is faring better , but it helps just to give a general idea . 
  if you want to see their ponderation in a country by country basis [ you can see it here ] ( http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/a-z ) , take caution a trend upward means worsening ( those graph are a bit gory ) , also take it with a big grain of salt they do n't reveal much in terms of modus operandi , and also be aware that even with a huge grain of salt portugal still has some legitimacy to call russia shity  sorry for the triggering,
