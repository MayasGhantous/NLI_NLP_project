  triggered much ? 
  in what is russia better than the honduras ? 
  [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_fragile_states_index ), 
  i do n't know , i would never think that something like the snoopers charter could even be considered for aproval in the uk , and yet here we stand, 
  give it time ... 
  they did n't get where they are over night, 
  russia 's economy was n't failing , they were converging in real terms with the west , you say that only city dewelers profited , but that is also were the most of russians live about 74 % of the population living in urban areas , the same value as germany . 
  but i agree , they are not losing , they got their trump card after all, 
  mate , do n't get me wrong , russia is as shitty as a shitty country can be , but saying that they had no growth in the last century is plain wrong and it is bluring your view of how effective the sanctions are being, 
   economically they are failing for the last 100 years [ that 's not true ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=662342400000&amp;tend=1451260800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  there is no purpose to a mass shooting other than the killing itself , while terrorism is done in order to leave the people in terror to push some agenda . 
  the difference is in the intention . 
  no , they are a portrayal of mass shottings and the american reputation that now lays in tatters, 
  meaningless , every country was `` besties '' with everyother country at some point in their history, 
  there is no problem in bias whatsoever , what you should be preocupied is with reliability . 
  cause bias you can eliminate from reading more than one source , but if reliability is low you only get more confused the more sources you read . 
  you took quite a hit with the crisis , i was n't expecting it to be so bad . 
  but seems you 're going in the [ right path ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:lva:blr:rus:ltu:est:pol:rom:mda&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=1103932800000&amp;tend=1451001600000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  just look how european countries outside the single market are faring , compared to the ones in the single market . 
  and look at the growth countries that once were outside the single market had once they entered . 
  shit , compare the baltics , poland , and romania with belarus , ukraine and moldova . 
  i was in brussels once , i was drinking my beer when some guy knocked it from my hand :( ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( he ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ apologised ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ offered ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pay ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ another ), 
  would you be interested in a trade agreement with england ? 
  - theresa may, 
  that 's the consequence of being alive, 
  it 's a 12 days old account with a generic `` europe '' flair, 
  better than just leaving italy and greece to deal with the problem . 
  i think what he whats to say but is afraid to say is throw them to the sharks, 
  you do n't need competence to be a dictator , africa is full of incompetent dictators . 
  and never forguet little kim, 
  we are actually supposed to call it the service now . 
  the force is too agressive . 
  a jesus is born everyday , in mexico mostly, 
   this country is basically india of eu - a huge outsourcing center . 
  so european jobs are going to poland and you are mad for it ? 
  no , it 's for ducks, 
  in spring it would be more scenic , major boost to the troops morale, 
  when will german agression ever end ? 
  if only the media was there to show us what happened ... 
  it was unthinkable even after the invasion for a [ certain president elect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjpgfjzheeo ), 
  if you have any relevant information or insight contact the police and tell them , if you do n't , your talking from your ass, 
   there was nothing bad , flawed or evil about them that could n't be said about any other combatant in ww1 the rape of belgium comes to mind, 
  what is n't ? 
  i was talking about spain in the last comment, 
  they enslaved the natives , the silver was n't getting mined by itself either, 
  fight for whom , the blood stained russian puppet or the beheading lunatics ? 
  the people at calais are not syrians, 
  it 's middle vertically, 
  that gold was n't getting mined by itself, 
  bloody hell , it 's an invasion !, 
  i thought that in flanders it was wunterslaush, 
  a person is responsible for their crimes , but you can not be responsible for the crimes of your forefathers , your comparison does n't work . 
  but i agree , turkey is not european and should never enter the union, 
  but cyprus is an island nation , by defenition it 's capital ca n't be in a continent, 
  oh , i see , fuck greece and fuck italy , am i right ? 
  tell me an example in wich bernie sanders , someone from podemos or syriza has done something that could be considered fascistc, 
  you 're on the way to bulgaria, 
  oh , i see , you 're a lunatic on a 4 days old profile , sorry for disturbing you on your trolling, 
  yeah , fuck those kids, 
  yeah , but where is portugal going to ? 
  so you are saying that education is not a french value ? 
  to where ? 
  why ca n't people put some trust in a purging government ?!, 
  oh lord please tell us why !, 
  but they have so much common sense ... 
  it would be whataboutism if i said that the guilty shoud not be persecuted . 
  i did not say that, 
  thank god muslims are stuck 100 years in the past or we could be dealing with atomic power, 
  there have been mirroring , yet independent groups doing this all across the world , catholic priests in belgium , ireland , the us , portugal and so on the list of countries is quite extensive ; single uncles rapping their nephews ; male and female teachers rapping their puppils ; fathers locking away their children underground to rape them in austria ; soccer managers ; beloved entertainment figures in the uk and portugal ; western turists in thailand ; russians and chinese people taking advantage of north korean run aways ; some men in the brazilian favelas ; some muslims in europe ... 
  it 's not a coincidence , it 's an illness that is quite generalised all over the world , i ask you again who is the demographic you speak about , and what do you propose ? 
  edit : and do n't forget alt-right forums are filled with people excusing rape, 
  who is that demographic , and what do you propose ? 
  that there are muslims raping children is not a fact that is hard for me to accept at all, 
  it worked , germany became so united that they started to unite with their neighbors, 
   sure every single one of them is an independently-thinking , sentient person , but when all these independently-thinking , sentient people have one very clear thing in common you then might have a problem to address . 
  then what you mean by that ? 
  what is the point you are trying to make ? 
  do women and children watch out in the dark for pakistani woman ? 
  if not then when they watch out in the dark is just for man being him a muslim or not . 
  yes i can , and i do , i do n't blame their followers though . 
  because nobody goes around saying that all men are colectively guilty of rapping children , except for some loonies , as it should be . 
  and yet when a muslim does it , suddenly they are all guilty . 
  i 'm not downplaying , i 'm pointing hypocrisy , if someone is guity of a crime lock him up , you do n't have to drag the rest of the nationality to it . 
  catholic prists have been doing this in a literal industrial scale for hundreds of years but i do n't blame all catholics for that , i blame the ones that are guilty . 
  they are all men ? 
  should i turn myself to the police ? 
  i mean i 'm a man and i 'm culturally catholic so i must be guilty by the crimes committed by other catholics , must i not ? 
  how does that change anything i said ? 
  and when they eventually bring the rest of their families it will be thousands of trillions , god have mercy on us all !, 
  you mean individuals , individuals have been doing this , lock 'em up and leave the inocent in peace . 
  it 's too easy , the irony is so thick it 's brittle, 
  he made a mistake , i belive he means tens of billions, 
   child-grooming gangs you sure you 're not talking about the catholic church in ireland ? 
  jews ? 
  of course you can kill a crab with one, 
  and people , and dogs , and antelopes , a silver bullet can kill pretty much any animal, 
  no effect ? 
  it 's been doing wonders for portugal, 
  but that is not deflation , is it ? 
  i see , let easily avoidable misery happen in a large scale across all sectors , but hey , it 's just for some years , it will get eventually better , only to happen again in the next economic circle .
