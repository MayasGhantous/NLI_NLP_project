  the people will be thrilled with so much stability . 
   computers are super deflationary and that does n't stop me from buying them . 
  wow !, 
  it sort of happens in a particular sector of the economy , i bet it is true to all the sectors . 
  tell me are computers deflationary by thenselves or because obsolescence to new releases ? 
  a very sensible aproach . 
  the people stop buying stuff waiting for the prices to go down even further , companies stop investing cause they know their profits wo n't be going up in a foreseeable future and start laying of people , so the people now with less purchase power buy even less , companies close and people starve to death , rinse and repeat . 
  how is it any better than the current system ? 
  then what do you do in case of deflation ? 
  bloody hell mate , digest it a bit , i ca n't deal with so much pseudo-economics in just one sitting . 
  just tell me what you mean with `` fuck with money '' and `` not that governments are going to easily give up that power '' since the euro is exactly governments giving up that power also the ecb is independent and does n't respond to political power , so does the bank of england and the federal reserve is as private as it can be for a central bank . 
  care to elaborate mister `` pro '' ? 
  gold and silver ? 
  how do you do monetary policy with that ? 
  i do n't think that anyone is advocating for mass immigration . 
  if you are talking about the refugee crisis it is quite a different problem , first because it is a conjunctural problem , and second i do n't know if you noticed but there is a war going on and the syrian civilians are being butchred by everyone involved , what we got to gain is avoid a catastrophe bigger than it is right now , keep them safe , and their children educated . 
  and what do you mean by state-enforced multiculturalism , can you be more specific ? 
  what do you mean by `` all this '' ? 
  i do n't desagree with curbing the imigration numbers , but all the hysteria that is made about the issue is pure non sense . 
  muslims are not 10 % , not even close . 
  estimated to higher rates they are now 3 % europe wide , in france 8 % and in germany and sweden 5 % . 
  their birth rate is higher than everyone else , but not by much and in 1 generation or 2 is the same that everyone else . 
  their numbers grow by imigration , not by out fucking everyone else . 
  to grow their percentage europe wise just to the number you think they are they now they would have to grow by way more than 25 milion . 
  and since a lot of them are not alowed to vote , the danger of them gaining political power to start enacting stupid laws is virtually inexistent . 
  the only way for that to happen is if the christian extremists start to realise that besides the veils , alcohool and pork there is not much that diferenciates them . 
   so solve the other . 
  if you know how please tell us , i 'm all eager to hear it, 
  2 december 2016 dear diary today i learned that saying that muslims wo n't be a majority in europe in 50 years in anonimity in an reddit dying thread is virtue signaling , thank god / u/moralmasturbation was here to correct me , thanks mate, 
  how many generations would it take , to grow from 5 percent to a sizeable proportion , when the average fecundity rate by woman is not much more than 2 kids ? 
  and have in mind that of those only a portion would support stupid laws . 
  that way you see how not an issue it is when compared to the support that parties like fn , pis , jobbik , golden dawn and npd are getting right now, 
  when the sun rises in the west , sets in the east when the seas go dry .

  indeed they are , but one of those ideologies has more chances of getting to a position of power than the other,

  when you talk about comunism you always bring those 2 cases up , it 's not fair to compare an ideology for their worst cases , why do n't you talk about comunist success stories like ethiopia , cambodia or even north korea, 
  the trick is you can not convince them , they are lost , you can only try to stop their illness from being passed to others . 
  as portuguese i have as much knowledge about spanish history as i have about sweedish history , not much , but enough to correct blatant lies . 
  correcting you is not a show of superiority , sorry if i passed as a dick, 
  your joke was lame , and [ spain existed in 1640 ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_iv_de_espa%c3%b1a ), 
  she was right though , half of trump supporters really are deplorable , there is not other way of putting it , deplorable might even be to soft a word it 's not a matter of agreeing or not , i did n't agree with bush , or romney or clinton but i would never call them deplorable . 
  but if the label fits what can you do ? 
  not say it ? 
  create a safe space ?

  so we are forever hostages to turkey ? 
  is that what you are saying ? 
  the eu does n't work as you think , turkey has to be accepted by all members without exception , even if they meet all the standards we have no obligation whatsoever to take them in,
