vasco da gama tower does n't look like that anymore . 
  it 's more of a wannabe burj al arab now . 
  see , we 're bros. . you 're welcome to visit and spend your money here . 
  hehe, 
  nah , that has always been greece . 
  our journalists would always point that out . 
  what 's that even supposed to mean ? 
  no , we do n't . 
  well , those are obviously the majority of the main investors globally , so i 'd say their opinion counts a lot . 
  gosh , and i though portuguese people were pessimistic . 
  cheer up mate . 
  i might be guilty of some gypsy jokes myself , but informed people know romania does n't equal romani . 
  and i love your language . 
  perception of italy by italians themselves might be lower . 
  i did n't look for it italy , but brazil , for instance , whilst seen badly internally , has n't suffered much externally . 
  the opposite is true for the uk . 
   `` a country 's reputation has a direct impact on tourism , its exports and foreign investment '' , said fernando prado , managing partner at reputation institute . 
  `` for example , when tourism improves by one pulse point , it has the effect of an increase of 0.09 points on tourist arrivals . '' on brexit :  brexit , the united kingdom 's decision to leave the european union ( eu ) , is taking its toll on the country 's reputation , which has sunk 5 places in the ranking index . 
  the consequences of brexit are mostly impacting supportive behaviours towards the country , with significant drops in `` invest '' , `` work '' and `` buy '' . 
  in contrast , the united kingdom 's internal reputation has noticeably improved by 7.5 % . 
  it only includes the 55 biggest economies in the world , that 's why there 's no slovakia . 
   the reputation institute 's country reptrak \u00ae report measures the reputation of the 55 countries with the highest gross domestic product ( gdp ) , based on the evaluation of 17 variables grouped into the following three dimensions : effective government , advanced economy and appealing environment . 
  the study , which took place this march , consists of more than 39,000 ratings by g8 citizens . 
  you can check the report for the methodology . 
  i get it if it 's just for fun . 
  but it is n't that useful . 
  it is easy for portuguese and spaniards . 
  i lived there for a while and kind of picked it without learning it . 
  israel is 42nd . 
  if it were just americans , the usa would n't be as low as it is . 
  i seriously do n't why people learn italian . 
  me neither . 
  this map 's wrong . 
  the nut 2 of the baltic countries correspond to the country as a whole . 
  lisbon has its small nut ii , though . 
  the region represents lisbon metropolitan area . 
  i know someone that went there and got something like -20 \u00b0 c or lower . 
  so there 's that . 
  belarus and ireland actually suit the countries better . 
  france needed a mustache . 
  how could you do that to denmark , you evil soul ?? 
  portugal : not triggered . 
  with all the brazilian millionaires with a `` golden visa '' switching miami for cascais nowadays , we might as well just change our flag to that .

  seriusly , i know we 've grown accustomed to the green and red , but blue and white makes historically more sense . 
  i know stuff because i 'm curious and do my research . 
  but the majority of people in my country no nothing other than their football team is kind of bad , it 's probably near russia , and probably cold as fuck . 
  czech-out is the best one . 
  pure economics . 
  they 're richer than the average spaniard . 
  if they were poorer they would n't come up with this new `` nationalist feeling '' and all these excuses of language , laws not approved by spain etc. 
  what 's so special about this picture ? 
  the empires were kept separate . 
  [ after the tragedy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkoecefeyv4 ) . 
  [ you 're right ] ( https://www.vidamarresorts.com/resort-algarve/assets/image/lifeinaday/1-grutas-praias-algarve.jpg ) . 
  i owe a proper visit to that region of my own country . 
  had the opportunity to see [ this ] ( https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/azure-window.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;crop=1 ) before it collapsed some months later . 
  it 's obvious that london and paris have the most clich\u00e9 `` must visit '' monuments in europe and possibly in the world , but saying porto and lisbon have n't got as many `` recognizable monuments '' as madrid , oslo ( ?? ), 
  is utter bs . 
  oh yes ? 
  so it took me just a 4-hour ride to visit all the 20 european countries i 've been too ? 
  did my car swim to get to the uk and malta ? 
  after i returned from a period in the czech republic i also thought i 'd never get used to portuguese beer again . 
  but super bock is super bock . 
  it matches the city , the climate , the ambiance . 
  pilsner and budweiser have to be in 1 l glasses with snow outside . 
   cannes or seville and bilbao , much less between say madrid and oslo what the hell have i just read ... you should travel more . 
  exports are growing by 17 % , and machines , vehicles , an refined oil predominate , so do n't distress . 
  [ this ] ( https://wp.webook.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/francesinhas-palacio-de-cristal-porto.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.superbock.pt/media/1090/original_bottle.png ) . 
  [ it 's well known ] ( https://www.askideas.com/media/81/belem-tower-at-night.jpg ) , at least to those that played aoe [ 2 ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/ageofempires/images/6/67/wonderportuguese.png/revision/latest?cb=20160106080345 ) and [ 3 ] ( https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/5869972206_2e051e025c_b.jpg ) ( apparently , florence 's duomo used to be in lisbon ) . 
   almada is lisbon it is . 
  they deliberately tried to portray a city stuck in the middle ages , like this is some kind of got scenario . 
  that 's luiz i , by eiffel 's pupil . 
  [ d. maria ] ( http://www.citybreakblog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/porto-ponte-maria-pia8272.jpg ) , further upstream , is the eiffel one . 
  he is in greater porto , though . 
  i think `` northern macedonia '' would be a good deal for both parties . 
   this section is based on surveys from visitors of this website . 
  questions for this surveys are similar to many similar scientific and government surveys . 
  very credible source , indeed . 
  well , that may feel however they want , but it 's a fact that are . 
  not as much as we did by controlling the spice trade . 
  i think you 're confusing with the silver mines in south america . 
  that has to do with tordesilhas treaty , not columbus and the bahamas . 
  spend as much money as you can and never speak spanish . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  if you 've got the euros , you might want to stay [ here ] ( http://theblondeabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/img_0563.jpg ) . 
  supposedly , it was salvador fernandes zarco . 
  lucky ? 
  the goal was getting to india , not the bahamas . 
   a cuban who discovered cuba . 
  there 's even a [ statue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/cristovaocolombocuba.jpg ) of him there . 
  there 's actually a theory he was a portuguese spy born in cuba , portugal . 
  [ this does it more justice . 
  ] ( http://www.cityrama.pt/www/uploads/tours/porto-noite/thumbs-760x420-adaptive/shutterstock-217601644-46.jpg ), 
  is this foreshadowing scottish independence ? 
  i guess you do like us better . 
  17.4 k moldovans in spain vs 13.6 k in portugal . 
  per capita that 's a lot more moldovans for us . 
  southern italy is tunisia , though . 
  trust me , i 've lived there .
