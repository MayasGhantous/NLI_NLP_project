fake fries . 
  sad !, 
  imperialist bastards !, 
  he 's on to us , fellows !, 
  hide the trebuchets !, 
  i do n't care what you call it , i just want all my hypothetical female employees to wear the hijab for the sake of cool fashion . 
  men now , now i think about it . 
  yeah , that 's why i made the post . 
  it seems people often tend to hold our drug policy like either a liberalized drugs utopia with simultaneously easier access and less consumption , or a hell-zone of higher consumption and free traffic . 
  none of these ideas are true . 
  like a sexy pious uniform , yes . 
  religious fundamentalist aggression !, 
  lisbon shall rise again !, 
   invicta always !!, 
  1828 best year of my life !, 
  all glory to the azorean islands who sided with liberalism !, 
  this is not true . 
  no-one thinks the country sits between santar\u00e9m and set\u00fabal . 
  that would involve plenty of non-lisbonites , and i do not recognize any borders but the municipality ones ( ja ) . 
  besides , those portuguese invaded us almost 900 years ago and are still occupying , what are they complaining about ? 
  good morning , officer !, 
  i would not know , really . 
  odd that there are n't more people commenting on the drug decriminalization bit . 
  that is often a source of much debate , almost always infected with terrible bias from both sides of the argument . 
  just in case someone wants to go at it , i 'll take the opportunity to preemptively point out that decriminalization is just making the consumption of these drugs no longer a criminal offense - it is * not * the same as liberalization . 
  you can not freely produce , trade and even consume all drugs . 
  you just wo n't go to jail for consuming . 
  also , this has neither led to a significant decrease nor an increase in drug consumption . 
  as far as i 've been able to gather , the effect in that regard seems to have been neutral . 
  what it has effectively led to ( or helped with ) was a significant decrease in public health problems related with drug use , such as new aids infections . 
  not about * the rain * , no . 
  get them talking about lisbon , though ... 
  so , if i understand the ruling correctly , it would be just as legal for my hypothetical company to enforce a dress code where ** everyone ** had to wear hijabs , right ? 
  i see some potential here . 
  yes . 
  the best of them all ( ja ), 
  those be fighting words there , mate !, 
   they seem pretty miserable people - which is amazing considering their main colony , brazil , is the exact opposite now , this is only the case if one compares us directly to the brazilians . 
  but in a continent that contains ~ ~ repurposed mongols ~ ~ finns , we 're a beacon of joy ( ja ) . 
  it is only logical to entrust our very own mongols with military leadership ( ja ) . 
  yeah , i 'd like a 5 as well , medium-rare . 
  bring the mustard too , please . 
  the unlikely nature is for such a thing even existing os precisely the point . 
  potential problem : the technology now exists to make these dolls . 
  the demand will always exist unless we can devise a cure for pedophilia . 
  if states make these illegal , are n't they just creating a massive and lucrative market for illegal sex dolls that will feed criminal cartels ? 
  sleazy as the product is , i 'd rather it was produced and sold through transparent companies and channels . 
  some people in this thread ask about the ethics of finding a model for the dolls - and that 's a good question - but what ethical rules will be followed by the underground illegal manufacturers ? 
  i 'd bet they would be far far worse . 
  alternatively , move all institutions to london . 
  ... by force !, 
  i liked the idea of moving the ema to strassburg and closing down the parliament . 
  but i guess macron chickened out of that one . 
  well ** i ** have a vested interest in portugal , so i 'll hold you to that districts flags bit . 
  although , i repeat , bringing in urban area population would be fairer . 
  moscow has more population than all of portugal , for ex , and it 's not fair to exclude moscovites over algarvians . 
  judging by the latest statements of preeminent brexiteers , `` fine '' is the continued existence of a united kingdom , without widespread hunger or occupying armies . 
  / s , but not by much . 
  you hear people like jacob rees-mogg talk about brexit and they 're claiming victory because the economy did n't collapse on the 24th of june 2016 . 
  the narrative is to portrait remainers as such cataclysmic pessimists that april 2019 will appear a victory if the lights are still on at all - even if electricity is needlessly more expensive due to a bone-headed euratom exit . 
  this is clearly bullshit behavior by multinationals , and i hope they are punished by it . 
  that said , it seems completely disproportional response to demand there are single product specifications across the continent . 
  not even the ussr had this !, 
  labeling is the way - have them publish the % of meat in the package for each market , and the list of % per market in their website . 
  nothing gets more lawyered than `` simple and clear '' rules , because they 're the ones that end up not fitting reality and thus generating conflicts that feed the lawyers . 
  i 'd know - i 'm a lawyer . 
  you ca n't have `` clear , simple and fair '' . 
  one of those always has to fall , because reality and language are not perfect . 
  * the rule you are advancing with the `` flads with official flag '' is clear and simple , but it 's not fair , because it allows for flags of relatively unimportant territories while keeping out major urban/historial areas . 
  * a hypothetical rule allowing for `` flads with more than x population , cities in the top 25 population , and historical regions when no official flag exists '' would be simples and fair , but admittedly not clear . 
  * another hypothetical rule allowing for `` flad 's and other demographically relevant local or regional flags '' would be simple and fair , but certainly not clear . 
  so choices have to be made . 
  and by the way , if you 're grandfathering in the old french flags even though they do not fit your current rule anymore , you 're already lawyering up your new rule . 
  autch , that 's bad . 
  instantly reminds me of [ vexillology 's most linked video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5ikb2hl4&amp;t ) , with all the detail and writing . 
  but there is the root of a good flag underneath . 
  put the stars somewhere else , replace the central symbol with a smaller simpler element that fits inside the cross and presto !, 
  i like it . 
  so , portuguese districts are going to be represented here by their district capital flag until they have their own flags , * right * ? 
  otherwise we would have a special rule for france , and that opens a whole can of worms . 
  also , it seems incongruous to remove the flags of groups like the sami because there are n't enough of them , but then have flags for regions with less than 100.000 people while not having moscow and its 13.000.000 . 
  just have also the top 25 urban areas as well . 
  wait , so france is getting regions even though they do n't have official flags anymore ? 
  : lisboning intensifies :, 
  add all capitals of district or bust !, 
  : prepares pitchfork :, 
  does n't even have an original motto - stole lisbon 's . 
  also if you want heads go for multicultural [ silves ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/silves_ ( portugal ) # / media/file : coa_of_silves_municipality _ ( portugal ) . png ) ( ja ) . 
  it does n't . 
  the lisbon district ( as all others ) is n't a real level of government , though . 
  it has no executive or legislative , and serves mostly to provide a coherent border to several other national entities when they are split in `` regional '' branches . 
  the next level `` down '' from national government + flag is the municipal government + flag , of which lisbon has the [ best ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/p/pt-%27nw8.gif ) [ flag ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandeira_de_lisboa#/media/file:lisboa.png ) [ ever ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandeira_de_lisboa#/media/file:pt-lsb1.png ) . 
  now of course you ca n't put in all 308 municipalities of portugal , but there should still be a lisbon flag because : * otherwise continental portugal just has no regional flags at all ; * it 's absurd to have flags of ceuta and melilla but not of europe 's 11th largest urban area ; * treaty of ** lisbon ** ; * it just looks great ; * please ? 
  : bambi eyes : in any case - while districts do n't their own unique flags , when the situation calls for a graphical identifier , they are represented by the [ flags of capital of district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/districts_of_portugal ) , since [ the districts are all named after their capital ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/districts_of_portugal ) anyway . 
  give lisbon flare please . 
  why must i use this vexillological monstrosity of the country that has been occupying and exploiting my fair city since 1147 ? 
  another victory for homogay yurop . 
  well that settles it then , 
  are you quite sure ? 
  i ask because poland did n't have any female monarchs that i know of from the era when people dressed like that , and yet the painting looks very much like [ empress elizabeth of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_of_russia ) , with the painting at the top left corner looking like [ emperor peter iii of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_iii_of_russia ) and the top right corner like [ emperor peter ii of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_ii_of_russia ) .
