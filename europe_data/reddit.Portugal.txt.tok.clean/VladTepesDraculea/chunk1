and then when i realized there were alternative means to get ahold of comics for free i managed to get updated again . 
  i just got far too outdated in it , if i 'd pick up now , there 'd be a 12-13 year gap . 
   i don \u00b4 t think i \u00b4 ve ever met someone who reads marvel/dc comics . 
  is it an american thing ? 
  yes and no , i am european and used to read spiderman and hulk comics . 
  i did n't exactly grew out of it ( probably would have at some point ) as they became more rare to find and eventually gave up . 
  i do think the movies are a bit ... too much . 
  i liked iron man ( but i have to say more for robert downey junior 's interpretation than anything else ) and loved christopher nolan 's batman . 
  aside that , meh ... 
  hello ladies \\ ^ \\ ^, 
   how is this not going to cost the state money ? 
  either costing money or reducing budget for the rest . 
  either way , this government is n't big on savings , just look at our current debt ...  are they removing a meat option and instituting a veggie one ? 
  not removing , although i believe places may be free of removing it . 
   what are you talking about , left bloc spent a good part of the campaign setting out the terms under which they would allow ps to govern with their support . 
  this was one of the main aspects of the tv debate with costa . 
  and ? 
  does n't mean they have compatible ideologies . 
  at the same time the left bloc talked about leaving euro ...  also left bloc is hardly anti-eu . 
  [ and yet they talk about leaving ... ] ( http://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/politica/detalhe/catarina_martins_defende_referendo_sobre_a_uniao_europeia_se_houver_sancoes_a_portugal )  also the left bloc as well as the communist party are not for a open-market , true , but neither is ps nor psd they are not supporting a deregulated market nor a neo-liberal one , but they are supporting of an international market . 
  i disagree , would that be the socialist party main interest , would have been easily negotiable . 
  that seems to be a bigger interest to the left block and specially to the portuguese communist party , as it gets it main electorial force and publicity through the public worker 's unions . 
  agora que falas , li mal , escreveste  funny how the name became eponymous to ** our ** left wing coalition e eu li  funny how the name became eponymous to ** a ** left wing coalition e estava a dar contexto xd sorry . 
  it has more to it . 
  these are parties who share very diferent views of both national and european systems and economy . 
  left block and the portuguese communist party are anti-eu and do n't believe in an open-market economy while the socialist party both stands for the eu and the international market . 
  since their political campaign was centered around economy , from a political point of view , this coalition makes little sence , when the biggest party in it , the socialist party has more in common , in theory , with the social democrat party , who drove the last government than with the other two , being this only a political move to rise to power as 1st player and not 2nd player , as it would have been had it made a coalition with the social democrat party . 
   and then the only thing the cia did was fund the right people i 'm pretty sure , if there is n't already , soon there will be some right people to fund . 
   if it were n't for us , you 'd all be speaking german now . 
  let 's be honest . 
  [ most likely not . 
  we could be speaking russian howhever . 
  thank goodness the republicans do n't rule the congr ... nevermind , crap may truly hit the fan ... 
  i mean , you could have added [ it ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ypvif ) to the list ... 
  also , i can also say le pen was never pro france , [ i will recognize le pen as part of russia ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/21/marine-le-pens-russian-links-us-scrutiny/ ), 
   that time angela merkel destroyed putin 's machismo destroyed ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it is still there ... 
  yup , specially now that seems the gop turned into ~ ~ a far ~ ~ * an `` alt '' * right party . 
  it falls in the rupert murdoch cathegory ... 
  you have to ajust to us standards ... 
   estonia is a developed country with an advanced , high-income economy that is among the fastest growing in the eu . 
  [ 19 ] its human development index ranks very highly , [ 7 ] and it performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom , civil liberties and press freedom ( 3rd in the world in 2012 and 2007 ) . 
  [ 20 ] the 2015 pisa test places the estonian high school students 3rd in the world , behind singapore and japan . 
  [ 21 ] the world needs more estonias !, 
  whatever you wish to believe ... 
  yes , we 're going in circles now ... 
  those exact tems , if you read carefully are an exageration :  it 's an age stereotype taken to the next level but the longing for the past , pre-eu or a romanticized memory of it , was not uncommon , along with some racist commentaries here and there particularly towards immingrants from india and africa . 
  what was also uncommon was the misunderstanding how eu works , how affects business and the lack of knowledge of eu funding certain areas . 
  also , possibly as a result the expectancy of growing more prosperous and a center of trade in the commonwealth alone , rather than a bridge to the eu . 
   tell me about your time in britain , and the places you went . 
  tell me about the conversations you had , and who you spoke to . 
  i 've been to several places from edinburgh / glasgow on the north to london in the south , should i make a written report and deliver it to your desk by monday ? 
   i am saying there are no credible sources in any of the media . 
  none . 
  that 's why you cross check your stuff but again , where is your start point ? 
  or you believe one should not have their opinion and accept what happens without giving a though ? 
  because if both news gathering from journalism and direct contact to the people in place is not enough to build an opinion , what is for you ? 
   have you been to the uk recently ? 
  yes . 
   have you talked to people about why they voted brexit ? 
  yes . 
   if you get all your info from these sources and you think they are credible , then i doubt there is much point in talking to you . 
  again , where do get info in your opinion then . 
  you added absolutelly nothing to this discussion ... 
  criticizing sources , not presenting better ones and not defending a point is not a discussion ...  but ask yourself this - did you really think the media was going to accept this result , and report it in a positive light in other eu countries ? 
  honestly ? 
  accept in what regard ? 
  and why would n't it be surprising ? 
  multiple channels , bbc , al jazeera , cnn , here , friends , the uk gov. , eu regulations , the washington post , i quoted a few here . 
  but tell me , what is a trustworthy channel for you ? 
   do you think there was misinformation from only the side you do n't agree with ? 
  mostly , since complaining about over regulation mixing food regulation with pillow regulations to saying uk was loosing money with the eu that could be ridirectly applied to the nhs ( something that good ol' farage was kind enough to demistify the next day ) . 
  so people who disagree with you are thoughtless lambs who regrogitate media conspiracy ? 
  the fact that older people are more avid voters , have voted in much greater percentage for * leave * and the the misinformation how the eu works spread with the * leave * campaign may have nothing to build one 's opinion ? 
  right ... btw i did n't say it was the issue , but part of it . 
  * yeah , young people and civil rights , those [ damn gay ] ( http://www.brin.ac.uk/figures/attitudes-towards-gay-rights/ ) and [ interracial marriages ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_369571.pdf ) , worker rights , consumer rights ... 
  i mean whats else , they want to advocate that [ human should have basic rights ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kvsxp/theresa_may_to_fight_2020_election_on_plans_to/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) ? 
  i mean , [ those damn millenials ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hfwok9slqq ) ruined [ the damn economy ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/05/baby-boomers-are-whats-wrong-with-americas-economy/?utm_term=.a6c490051771 ) . 
  yeah , most people motivated to vote were the elder who lived through times where they saw how politics matter . 
  unfortunatly , many of these older people also do n't quite understand the modern world and long for an idea of their old world they thought better . 
  it 's an age stereotype taken to the next level : * these kids these days with their unions and globalization . 
  in my days we had everything we needed and we were proud of the empire . 
   just because someone does n't feel good about brexit now does n't mean they suddendly changed their minds . 
  i have friends that changed their mind on the next day and still keep that opinion . 
  many people believed markets would rise thanks to it and were still discussing it while the pound was sinking . 
  when they looked at the data and started hearing about companies planning to leave the country , well , they took it as a shock . 
  i would n't be surprised this was true for a significative number of people , specially given that * leave * won with a very short margin . 
  with the discontentment of scotland , it might . 
   elves against trolls [ i thought it was the danish ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cisfb ) . 
  so ~ ~ gandalf ~ ~ the uk leaves the party then comes back in the second movie ? 
  also regulation . 
  the usa regulation of firearms are lacking , they do n't even have bullet serialization . 
  canada and switzerland have tighter regulation as far as i know , many people may have firearms but is easier to see who shot a gun and is more restricted to who can get hold of a gun ( i.e. 
  criminal reccord , mental illness , etc ) . 
   guns availability is reduced ( so it 's less `` easy '' to kill somebody ) but * guns do n't kill people , people kill people * . 
  i think it can at least be said that mccain is a shinning thread of sanity on the gop . 
  i 'm glad he lost to obama but compared to the ones that followed him he seems like someone thouched by the blue fairy ... 
  speak for yourself . 
  me and most people i know have reached a different conclusion . 
  and stuff like the invasion of crimea only supported that conclusion .
