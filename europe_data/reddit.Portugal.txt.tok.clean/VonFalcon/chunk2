  stay safe netherlands , we believe in you whatever the result , 
  this was actually very similar to the speech i heard just before a voting process a few years back but for abortion rights . 
  the priest did n't exactly say out loud which option we should vote for but he did gave multiple `` hints '' during mass . 
  once it ended i went to the both and voted for pro-choice , i may be religious but i hate when the church thinks they know better on what i should do ... 
  has opposed to elections during weekends when everyone just goes off to the beach/mall and neglects to vote ? 
   patent production per capita , r&d investments and personnel , hi-tech exports and so on . 
  it 's pretty much a made up index , does n't correlate with wealth at all , seems kind of silly that people are connecting it to wealth but oh well ... 
  it actually does n't seem to amount to much , people in the comments are connecting it to wealth when it does n't correlate . 
  guess some are just happy to have a better color than others i guess ... 
  but then you go back to the argument of `` if you ca n't prove it does n't exist , then it might still do '' . 
  you are correct when you say that our instruments right now ca n't detect it , but the correct conclusion should be `` therefore , has of right now , they do n't exist '' instead of `` they might exist since we do n't know '' . 
  it 's the old story about the spaghetti monster living in the center of our sun , we ca n't know if he 's there so why not believe in it ... tl ; dr : the current conclusion should be `` ghosts still do n't exist '' . 
  [ rant ] i do n't really mind that spain is worse at math compared to portugal . 
  but i do mind that they suck at programming and english . 
  like , i just sent a spanish client , team of 5 ( !, 
  ) , a program he asked for with clear instructions , step by step , in english on how to use it ( has agreed ) , he responds ( in spanish ) asking for instructions in spanish . 
  i send a google translated link ( because i 'm not gon na translate it myself by hand and god forbid i write it in portuguese , that would just be an insult ) and he still responds in spanish saying he ca n't understand it . 
  [ end rant ], 
  i believe this comes from an `` outside notion '' that sweden is a model country when it comes to a lot of things . 
  if these kind of things were happening and talked about in countries from southern eu i do n't think this much drama around the issue would exist , if only because voices would rise about how these countries are near the border of influxes and how they have a lot more economical problems ( at least i know i would n't , we get these type of news in portugal every once in a while and i do n't think many are surprised ) . 
  it only shows an expected view on how many believed sweden to work , i would n't take it to heart , it comes from ignorance and fear mostly , there will be crime and crazy people everywhere , just have to learn to deal with it . 
  hey , we jumped ship a ** long ** time ago just so we did n't have to deal with such messes , do n't put this on us ... 
   much of what leave voters were promised is unavailable because the eu was never responsible for a lot of things that made them angry . 
  i think this line in the article pretty much sums up the situation ... 
  ok , now you lost me , you 're angry because countries with economical agreements between them are selling/buying shit ? 
  so because you 're country gave some money to another you thin you should know or dictate how they spent it ? 
  i think that goes a bit above your level of decision . 
  if there are people protesting is because they feel the money coming from the outside is not being spent on thing that matter to them . 
  in portugal for one most of the eu money went to fill the holes left in by the baking system , the `` average joe '' on the street does n't really like that for obvious reasons . 
  when you 're asking for `` some respect '' maybe you should think about the situation first , in most cases these protest are being directed at the system more than at institutions/countries . 
  ps : has for the pension age , you 're starting to sound a lot like the people you 're asking respect from , blaming them for your own problems . 
  news flash , pension age is rising everywhere has politicians realize the current systems of pension are not sustainable , it 's gon na get worse everywhere ... 
  dude , relax , he 's an outlier , a frustrated moron who thinks the rest of europe is at fault because he took a degree in gender studies and now ca n't find a job . 
  not everyone in south europe is mad at the north/center , many realize it 's our own fault for getting where we are . 
  it 's just that a lot of the changes came way to fast or way to harshly and that made people lose a bit of fate in the union , but it 's not like we hate you or anything ... 
  man , how easy is it to just throw around random nonsense and not provide any sort of proof or info on how that is/isn ` t !, 
  strange world we live in ... 
  glad to see it was n't only me ... 
  i kid you not , just last week my parents came back from church and said the new substitute priest we have there is a polish priest speaking with a brazilian accent . 
  the combination is so weird . 
  i wonder if you truly believe the uk is being sidelined and people like farrage are being ridiculed because the eu wants that ? 
  the uk has been showing growing signs of not wanting to discuss things in a balanced matter , there 's no one in the uk showing any moderation towards the process , it 's only hostility . 
  at this point it can be argued that it is n't clear who threw the first stone but i say the uk voting leave is a good contender . 
  i do n't fault mep 's for being aggressive , the uk showed that 's the way they want to do things . 
  is it a good thing ? 
  is it what the current environment between both sides leads to ? 
  yes . 
  people like farrage are not helping one bit ... 
   just to clarify , in your country , the pm could pick anyone as , say , minister for tourism ? 
  it might be a party donor , or a civil servant , or a leading business figure or academic or something ... it does n't have to be someone who was elected to parliament ? 
  i 'm not gon na lie to you , this is the case in 99 % of the cases , of course the prime-minister chooses people from his party that were elected to parliament , but there 's no rule for this , there are cases of `` independents '' ( usually university teachers or people at the top of their areas ) that have been invited to become ministers . 
  again , i personally do n't see the problem with the commission not being `` elected '' , they are still `` chosen '' and must go through a screening process , the flaws of the democratic system be damned but nothing is perfect and equally effective ever . 
  in the end i just think people are getting angry at different interpretations of the process , i may not agree with it but does n't mean it 's better/worst than the alternative ( which is what nigel seems to be advocating , hence why many do n't like him , presenting things has right/wrong when they 're grey does n't make you many friends on the opposite side ) . 
   i simply asserted that the commissioners are not elected , and people tried to argue that they are . 
  again , that 's because your definition of `` are elected '' is different from other people that , again , have different political backgrounds on how parliament/elections work . 
  i ` de wager the process in the uk is different enough ( actually , i know for a fact how different it is ) that you ca n't fault nigel for his opinion nor the people against it . 
  people are mostly angry at him for stating something has facts , black and white , when it 's a bit more grey than it seems . 
  i for one also do n't like him using the argument of an `` unelected commission '' has a criticism when he promoted to leave the union , basically forgoing any attempt at changing the system he had in the first place . 
  it 's like someone shouting `` i do n't like this but i also do n't want anything to do in fixing it !, 
   as it happens , the ministers in my government are elected members of parliament . 
  so every single one of them has stood for and won an election . 
  see , this is what may be confusing some people because this is not the case in many places . 
  i do n't know where you 're from but in my country ministers can be picked at will , when you 're voting you do it for the parliament , from there comes a prime-minister and from him a government with ministers . 
  has far has i know it 's like this in many other places , you do n't elect ministers themselves , hence why many do n't have a problem with this but you seem to do ... 
  the fact that he is having pretty calm and insightful discussions seems to put your fear a bit to rest . 
  if it happened to you maybe try articulating your positions better next time . 
  has for u/trinitae comments , i may not agree with him but that does n't mean he ca n't ( or should n't ) say what he wants , because in the end it seems to be more of a case of `` you worry about stuff on a different level to what i do '' ... 
  why do you want to vote on the commissioner ? 
  do you get to select the ministers for your government has well ? 
  i 'm confused ... 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rev1g/target_merkel_how_the_international_far_right/dd6sj5y/ it 's literally the response he makes below , it 's not that hard ... 
  but that 's only against aliens , i 'm sure other human beings would n't be affected by this ... 
  this map is using outdated sources , it 's pretty unreliable , it 's also wrong for portugal , there are more brazilians than angolans on a 4 to 1 margin, 
  hey luxembourg , fancy that !, 
  hope we 're not causing to much trouble , life 's hard , need work , you know how it is . 
   edit : also according to the last national census there are more brazilians in portugal now , this map is using pretty outdated sources i would assume , not very reliable :(, 
  sadly it 's actually one of the reasons why the discussion around climate change has been so polarizing in the us . 
  there have been documented cases of teachers in univ. / college starting discussions with `` i 'm not liberal/conservative but climate change ... '' which should never be the case on how to start , this type of issues affect everyone independently of your political convictions . 
  unfortunately we still have some way to go ... 
  wait a second , you mean to tell me that the name of that board game is actually a real place ? 
  what 's next , you 're gon na tell me there 's an island called catan ? 
  this explains a post i saw a couple days ago , i 'll see if i can find it . 
  edit : [ found it !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5onqoq/price_comparison_of_a_weekend_getaway_to_30/dcku25m/ ), 
  taxes most likely , i know of a lot of portuguese who cross the border to buy food and oil just because your taxes make them cheaper in some cases ... 
  how about the [ arc de triomphe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arc_de_triomphe ) ? 
  it 's also a monument to remember those who died . 
  and there are people everyday taking smiling and upbeat pictures over there . 
  it does n't mean they forget necessarily what it 's about , and even if they do i think it 's not right to shame them for it just for your own self enjoyment ... 
   no historical event compares to the holocaust . 
  ok there cowboy , slow down now , there are many other reported events of cultural/racial/religious mass murders in history , do n't pretend you 're some special snowflake now ... 
   they should keep exclusive right to say what can be displayed of them . 
  they do . 
  they just need to send an email to undouche.me@yolocaust.de and ask him . 
  it 's not very hard . 
  * insert trump joke here * & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ ^ could ' t ^ ^ ^ hold ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ in !, 
   guy verhofstadt is chief brexit negotiator for the european parliament so i 'm reading the article thinking `` i do n't know who the person who wrote this is , but he seems like a down-to-earth fella '' and then notice this . 
  glad to see some people with important positions still value moderation and understanding in this world . 
  once you reach the bottom , the only way is up it seems ... 
  i was super surprised no mention of lisboa or porto , we get constant news about how our 2 biggest cities are becoming great hotspots for tourism and what not and then a report like this does n't mention them ?
