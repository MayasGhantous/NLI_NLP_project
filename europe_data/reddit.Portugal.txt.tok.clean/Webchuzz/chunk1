i actually think that conchita 's singing and song were the best on that year , despite everything else , including sexual orientation , looks , etc. 
  misleading title , should have been `` how to piss off someone with common sense '', 
  if you already have a car show , why would you replace it for another one that touches the same subject ? 
  i see it only as an excuse for a name change that way . 
  why ? 
  the automobile industry keeps evolving and changing , thus providing new material for more episodes . 
  that logic ca n't be directly applied to top gear because it 's not a soap opera or similar . 
  meanwhile , this week in london , we had a single day with rain , then snow , then sunshine and then thunder . 
  glorious . 
   unnatural things  chemicals this gets me everytime . 
  i 'm saying that ** the vote to outst the government ** will happen , not if the president accepts it or not . 
  it is going to happen . 
  pcp ( communist party ) even has officially declared that is going to support a ps government . 
  what was the question asked in the ballot ? 
  interesting , i did n't expect the percentage in hungary to be lower than bulgaria . 
  and yet they like to claim that millennials are an entitled generation that likes to loath around even though they still live with their parents at late 20 's because they ca n't even afford their own place and they subject themselves to low pay wages or even unpaid internships . 
  that 's the torygraph for you . 
  i was in lanzarote this summer and they served me cruzcampo in the hotel 's restaurant , since it was the one included in the menu . 
  possibly one of the worst beers i have ever had in my entire life . 
   `` just listen to the way a lot of politicians and commentators talk about the public . 
  they find their patriotism distasteful , their concerns about immigration parochial , their views about crime illiberal , ** their attachment to their job security inconvenient ** ( ... ) '' funny , given that a lot of potential new jobs just vanished after the referendum because companies were uncertain about the future . 
  love it as well but i weep every time i compare the price of properties in london to the rest of the country . 
  also polish . 
  she was born polish and then naturalized french . 
  what is going on in lithuania ? 
  aaaaand he deleted all his comments . 
  i said that because there were actual people interviewed in the streets of the uk that genuinely thought that you guys were not part of the eu anymore and they were puzzled why all the migrants were still in the country . 
  it was on tv and newspapers . 
  i said no lie , just stated a fact . 
  you 're just trying to twist what i said to suit your rant . 
  seems to me you are the one playing stupid . 
  after reading your comment i am honestly lost . 
  it is not even remotely related to what i said , it just looks like you started spewing nonsense in every direction . 
   thing is , it 's setting up a situation / narrative definitely agree with that , especially when you have people that truly believe the uk has already left the eu . 
  a good rule of thumb from now on is , whenever you see `` brexit '' being referred in the media just associate it with the referendum and not with the actual leaving process itself . 
  i was referring specifically to leave.eu campaign , which is the one mentioned in the article ; the fact that it is the `` official '' one or not is irrelevant in the context of my comment . 
   as someone who was very involved in the brexit campaign i am not advocating immediate triggering of article 50 , i think the current government position of working out a negotiating stance before triggering it is the correct one i also believe that is the most sensible path to take onward . 
  i am not implying that leave.eu is an accurate representation of all leave voters intentions because i believe it 's not . 
  nevertheless , on their website , they advocate for triggering article 50 `` at the earliest possible opportunity '' and that was the point i was trying to make . 
  the referendum is over but they are still active and advocating for the immediate activation of article 50 . 
   team gb , an epitome of the establishment ah , the `` establishment '' word being thrown around again . 
  you can always get knorr , it 's basically the same . 
  i have been to sofia recently and i really enjoyed it . 
  a lot of areas had old buildings in bad shape but somehow i think it gave the city some kind of natural beauty of its own . 
  i was honestly expecting the streets to have some litter but i was mistaken . 
  the metro really surprised me for how clean and modern it is . 
  also , the food is unbelievably delicious and cheap . 
  i think it 's a reference to polandball . 
   after brexit do they mean `` after the referendum '' ? 
  because the uk is still in the eu and did n't even invoke article 50 yet . 
  abrantes masterrace checking in . 
  they are actually saying `` hear '' , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  switzerland would be efta + schengen . 
  not this image again . 
  i fully agree with you but `` terror '' is not exactly the same as `` terrorism '' . 
  the latter implies that there is a pursuit of political aims . 
  let 's just wait for more information . 
   it 's obvious what happened then you should inform the bbc and other major news outlets because you know something they do n't as of yet . 
  too late , the subreddit that shall not be named already stickied a thread about this so they can circlejerk each others to death . 
  edit : unsurprisingly i was right . 
  the amount of assumptions over there without a single drop of information is astounding . 
  edit2 : looks like that the [ met police ] ( https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/844572599342518273 ) is defaulting to terrorism until proven otherwise . 
  cool information but laid out in such an unnecessarily complicated way to read . 
  i am not in portugal at the moment . 
  also , i work within a team with people from several different countries . 
  i do n't think that hearing this joke from another portuguese person would make sense in any way . 
  in the end , i am also attesting to my own experience . 
  pot meet kettle ? 
  i have heard/seen it pretty much everywhere , hence why i said `` across so many different places '' . 
  that is a set that also includes the physical world . 
  i get that joke from friends and work colleagues quite regularly . 
  maybe you are the one who spends too much time on reddit ( yes i saw your post before you ninja edited it ) . 
  honest question : how is it a good joke ? 
  i like the occasional jab at us and i believe that it is good to laugh about yourself first than anything . 
  but this joke has been repeated so many times across so many different places that i , and most people i guess , have got completely desensitized towards it . 
  for me , it 's the same thing as saying that `` all french people surrender '' is a good joke . 
  i really do n't think it is . 
  the same way you guys speak american ? 
  first time i have heard of such thing in my life . 
  i 'm curious now ; what did he hear ? 
  what is it with almost every single uk/brexit thread having a comment like yours , throwing the regular tantrum of how it will be downvoted , etc ? 
  same exact thing happened [ before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5oolj1/uk_unemployment_rate_falls_to_48_and_pay_growth/dckv87l/ ) and look how it turned out after all . 
   i mean farage came out and said the bus was a mistake after the referendum result . 
  well , the uk wo n't be part of it anymore so , yeah , if that is what you mean by `` will not exist in the same way it does now '' then i fully agree . 
  other than that it 's a pretty vague statement to be made . 
  drinking champagne ? 
  that 's what i call enthusiasm . 
  well i was wrong but it [ was n't a big majority leave ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/12c6c/production/_90080967_birminghamgraphic.jpg ) . 
  brighton , bristol , liverpool , cardiff , birmingham ... 
  just because french guyana is an overseas department of france does n't mean it is in europe . 
  the continent name is used as a basis for the geographical location , therefore saying the bridge is in europe is incorrect . 
  you could have said something like `` eu 's only bridge to brazil '' since french guyana is part of the eu for being under france 's control . 
  the bridge is not in europe though . 
  a bridge , a shopping center and a tower . 
  that 's it , as far as i know . 
  since the name was n't referred by op ( it is on the header of the flickr page though ) , this is vasco da gama bridge . 
  not normally ? 
  i 'd dare say i 've never seen it being referred to as a nordic country ever . 
  it 's not gon na happen because they mixed the values in the chart . 
  pretty much .
