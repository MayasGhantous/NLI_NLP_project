  til that in the uk there is an entitlement to annual leave of 14 weeks : http://i.imgur.com/aqh7n7r.png fyi , they screwed up the chart and swapped the eu entitlement to maternity pay value with the uk entitlement to annual leave one . 
  the whole thing reads like a report more than a plan honestly . 
  yes , that would be arron banks . 
  in the uk , someone was inspired by breitbart and started their own news website : westmonster . 
  it claims to be anti-establishment whilst its own creator is a millionaire and tax dodger . 
  comparing the soviet union with the eu ? 
  that 's a good start . 
  even the name of the country gives it away . 
  inb4 `` no one likes to see the uk perform well '' , '' all uk good news are downvoted '' and/or other variations . 
  i really do n't find the uk depressing at all . 
  maybe some specific regions , sure , but that happens in every country . 
  the drinking problem , in my view , is more tied to the binge drinking culture of the uk , not so much as a mean of coping with the general dullness . 
  right after bandiaterra . 
  are all romanians gypsies ? 
   well the bird is brazilian ah well that explains why i did n't know about this nomenclature . 
  til . 
  never heard of such thing , maybe another fellow luso-redittor is aware of this . 
  i have listened to the speech live . 
  she kept contradicting herself in a lot of areas . 
  she claimed that they are leaving the eu entirely , so , `` no keeping bits of the eu '' , which initially dismisses any possibility of a bespoke deal . 
  then she goes to say that the uk ideally would still have some sort of `` access '' to the single market :  so we do not seek membership of the single market . 
  instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new , comprehensive , bold and ambitious free-trade agreement . 
  basically , she wants access to the single market , free if possible , while having her own immigration controls . 
  this , in itself , is already a bespoke deal of some sort . 
  well , did it ? 
  fully agree with you , it does n't make sense . 
  on the other hand , you also have people on the other side of the spectrum ( some leave supporters ) that feel a-ok with the idea of possibly punishing other eu nations/nationals . 
  there 's a lot of shitty people on both sides of the argument , no point on arguing about that . 
  now we should just move on and look for a deal that is fair for both parties . 
  no one wants to `` punish '' the uk . 
  you are currently in the eu and pay a membership fee to do so and in return you have benefits . 
  there are also some opt-outs in the case of the uk . 
  if you leave the eu and stop paying the membership fee then you also lose the benefits . 
  that 's it ; it 's not rocket science . 
  this is no form of punishment at all . 
  at the time of your comment , the post was 15 minutes old . 
  every thread here always gets some kind of initial influx of downvotes/upvotes initally and evens out as time goes by . 
  ironically , it is mostly on posts regarding brexit that people throw complains like yours . 
  chill . 
  at a glance , looking at the thumbnail made me think it was a picture of guy fieri . 
  it 's funny because they are constantly complaining that any good news for the uk are downvoted because `` no one wants the uk to succeed after brexit '' , even when the event in question is n't related to brexit in any way , shape or form . 
   why did the british economy do ok ** after ** brexit ? 
  how can you comment on the state of something after an event that still has n't happened ? 
  i have been to one of his restaurants . 
  you pay considerably above average for an average meal . 
  it 's not that the food is bad , it 's just overpriced . 
  just another `` eu is evil '' narrative advocate living in is own fabricated pseudo-reality bubble . 
  i 'd be surprised if the person that claimed to want a `` red , white and blue brexit '' knew anything at all at this stage . 
  it actually is n't . 
  he was referring to mr-oldfart 's comment , not yours , hence why he said it 's irrelevant to * your * comment , despite your comment being accurate or not . 
   do n't forget the compulsory `` but we have n't left yet '' from the salties well , did you ? 
  that 's pretty much the main reason . 
  are you american ? 
  if so , i find it a good starting point to get the sound from the word `` bu ** tt ** er '' ( it kinda sounds like a `` d '' but it is in fact an alveolar flap ) and work your way to the trilled `` r '' sound . 
   they arent given the right to remain due to eu stubbornness it 's up to the uk to trigger article 50 but somehow it 's the eu being stubborn . 
  ok then . 
  any clues to why albania 's value is over the roof compared to the neighboring areas ? 
  after brexit and potus election , i am having a hard time trusting any kind of polls this year . 
  to be fair , `` no '' should be the only option . 
  pineapple in pizza is atrocious . 
  i do n't think it is a no-brainer honestly . 
  in specific cases , you want to prioritise how skilled someone is and not so much where they are from . 
   people are also very aware of some companies only advertising abroad so that they can pay far cheaper wages . 
  what kind of industries are we talking about ? 
  in a big portion of these cases , companies advertise abroad because there could be a lack of skilled national workforce , not specifically to lower the wages . 
   this is not the same as what you 're implying , though . 
  as i have said before , i agree with you that there are several reasons to want better control of immigration . 
  but if you prioritise british nationals first , effectively the others will only have a chance once there is n't any more british workforce left . 
  take this as you will but the `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' rhetoric , as daft as it sounds , is a valid way of interpreting this specific scenario . 
  i thought you were joking but it 's actually true . 
  - do you seek to engage in terrorist activities while in the united states or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities ? 
  - are you a member or representative of a terrorist organization ? 
  - have you ever or do you intend to provide financial assistance or other support to terrorists or terrorist organizations ? 
   people have many reason for wanting to control immigration . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  however , one of those reasons is prioritising british workers when recruiting to jobs ( 67 % according to a [ poll by yougov on immigration ] ( http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/88q0g7tq8f/yg-archive-140211-channel5-immigration.pdf ) ) , which is basically a nicer way of putting things instead of saying `` i do n't want immigrants stealing our jobs '' . 
   nobody said `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' . 
  that 's a / r/europe meme . 
  `` immigrants are stealing our jobs '' - the sentence in itself may be a / r/europe meme , but several polls showed that having total control over immigration policies is the strongest factor amongst leave voters on which policy should be prioritised ( second most popular choice is `` access to the single market '' ) . 
  i 'm confused when people say `` you left the eu '' because i know some of them mean `` you voted to leave '' . 
  on the other hand , i believe that there are people that genuinely think that the uk has already left . 
  not sure which case this one is . 
  no , it 's the new lodgy . 
  koji tsuruoka ( nissan ) said that nissan remaining in the uk will depend on the profits of the company . 
  he also claimed that the most important bit is the combination of no tariffs and no obstruction for the free flow of parts , and the future of this is still uncertain , depending on the type of post-brexit arrangement . 
  as for google , this project for reallocating staff into the uk and building a new hq is something being planned since 2013 . 
  sundar pichai ( google ) also said that barriers to skilled immigration would put some of google 's investment at risk . 
  simply put , i do not believe that brexit is the apocalypse that many people imagine it to be . 
  however , thinking it will be the best thing ever is also slightly surrealistic . 
  your country still has n't invoked article 50 . 
  why are you linking unemployment figures to something that has n't happened yet ? 
  good news , nevertheless . 
   mansplaining is when ' a man explains something to a woman without being asked , particularly something which she might already know more about than him ' why have a hotline just for this ? 
  hell , why report something like this in the first place ? 
  is this a common issue in sweden ? 
  it was already meaningless on day 1 , just like `` brexit means brexit '' . 
  so he went from saying that he found trump 's agenda and manner `` worrying '' to `` full of good ideas '' . 
  bellend . 
  \\* looks at portugal 's entry \\* oh boy ... 
  ireland will wise up and leave the eu nice joke , 5/7 .
