  i 've been to bulgaria last year and and there was a bulgarian girl sitting next to me during the flight . 
  she looked like she wanted to get up to go to the wc so i asked her if i should move and then she tilted her head sideways . 
  i was confused and did n't move until she actually said `` yes '' . 
  i have n't traveled that much yet but so far the best food i 've had abroad was definitely in bulgaria , and it was so cheap . 
  birthplace of the cyrillic script and a beautiful language . 
  i 've been to bulgaria before and it was impressive how easy it was to find people smoking on the streets so the 35 % figure does n't strike me as surprising , but 42.4 % for greece ? 
  that 's crazy ; anyone care to enlighten me on the reasons why it 's so high ? 
  reminds me of the outrage when jamie oliver used chorizo in a paella dish and when he basically violated the recipe for bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s by not using garlic and putting stuff like chilli and vinegar . 
  the way they gaze at each other ... bromance is strong with these ones . 
  that is 100 armenian dram ( ~ = $ 0.18 ), 
  it looks like a dingaling-ding-dong . 
   and your missing mine there 's shady parts in every city of europe , that 's the only point extractable from your comment and that is also what i mean initially . 
   why bring that up at all ? 
  because i 'm replying in a comment chain regarding london and frankfurt ? 
  why getting so defensive ? 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  because that 's a thing that does n't happen in london , right ? 
  the irish one though ; trying to rustle some jimmies i see . 
  great suggestion !, 
  i 'll let the authorities know right away . 
  / r/backfiredcomments, 
  kommissar rex was the shit , it used to broadcast in portugal as well and i loved to watch it when i was younger . 
  i thought so . 
  by the way i was extremely impressed when i was there , the metro stations and infrastructure in general are crystal clean and very modernized . 
  i miss your food as well . 
  is this the same metro line that goes to terminal 2 of the airport ? 
  we have a similar word for that , which is `` anteontem '' . 
  `` desenrascan\u00e7o '' loosely ( very ) translates to `` disentangle '' or `` improvise '' . 
  i 've also seen it translated as `` to pull a macgyver '' . 
  more info about it [ here ] ( http://portuguesefordummies.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/question-5-what-is-desenrascano.html ), 
   / r/shiteuropeanssay / i actually had a look and it looks like the type of sub created by someone who got butthurt at a random answer from here . 
  i might be wrong though . 
  probably the mediterranean spanish coast . 
   also , they 're served with powdered sugar here , which apparently spaniards find strange . 
  that 's definitely not a country-wide thing . 
  out of all the festivities i have been to i have never , ever , seen churros with powdered sugar , only regular sugar . 
  reply, 
  natural gas ( uk ) . 
  trust me , i know exactly what you mean . 
  espresso with one sugar packet ( about 6g ) . 
  in general , anywhere you go , if you ask for `` coffee '' you will get an espresso as default . 
  friend of mine keeps telling me that banja luka is the place he has been to with the largest proportion of hot women . 
  i have n't been there so i do n't know how true this is ; maybe a fellow bosnian ( or someone who hasbeen there ) could drop a comment . 
  too common . 
  most plastic food containers used at home are called `` tupperwares '' from the brand tupperware . 
  any can of insecticide is usually called '' [ dum dum ] ( https://www.atuadespensa.pt/images/loja/product/resized/100001293.jpg ) '' . 
  not sure at a national level but where i come from we usually say `` do you have a fat arse ? 
  brussels for me as well . 
  living in london ; water is included in the rent and i pay around # 40 max for both gas and electricity . 
  never been to that sub , possibly because , in my opinion , / r/askreddit already feels overwhelmingly american in general . 
  not awkward at all but also not enforced socially . 
  there was a wave of portuguese migration ( mostly madeira and azores citizens ) to hawaii between the 19th and 20th century . 
  they have brought with them the [ malasadas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/leonard%27s_malasadas.jpg ) and i know that the ukelele is a hawaiian adaptation of the [ cavaquinho ] ( https://images-americanas.b2w.io/produtos/01/00/item/8087/7/8087722_1sz.jpg ) . 
  uk provider : - # 10 - 1-month rolling contract - 4gb at 4g - 1500 minutes - unlimited texts - eu roam like at home included, 
  there are literally more than 5 posts in the hot section at the moment from americans that are not downvoted so i do n't get your point . 
  questions are downvoted when they 're obviously troll or nonsensical , regardless of nationality . 
  currently living with gf in a 2-bedroom flat in london zone 2 . 
  i 'd say the whole building is 20 years old max . 
  my commute takes 30 minutes door-to-door ( about 11km ) . 
  there are a few indian restaurants here and there but i would say it 's far from being popular . 
  chinese food would probably take that spot . 
  yep . 
   the uk and england ? 
   a micro state like angola surely you meant andorra ? 
  if you really intend the title of this post to be taken seriously at all then please expand on the matter . 
  eurovision should never be used to gauge the musical talent of a country . 
  currently living in the uk and thoroughly enjoying it . 
  not thinking about going back to portugal anytime soon , unlesss due to unforeseen circumstances ( e.g. 
  not trying to get any fights going on or anything but just to be brutally honest , cruzcampo is probably the worst beer i have ever had in my entire life . 
  pretty much ( in the uk currently ) . 
  i pay # 5 a month for 1gb of 4g data , 250 min of calls ( barely use it ) and 500 sms ( barely use them ) . 
  `` tarde '' can also mean afternoon , so saying `` till 11 in the afternoon '' does n't make much sense . 
  it 's currently in power . 
  the `` c '' in noc sounds like the `` ts '' in hats , i think . 
  madrugada ( dawn ) ( between midnight and sunrise ) [ de ] manh\u00e3 ( morning ) ( from sunrise to lunch time ) hora de almo\u00e7o ( lunch hour/time ) ( approximately between 12h - 14h ) tarde ( afternoon ) ( between lunch and dinner ) hora de jantar ( dinner hour/time ) ( approximately between 19h - 21h ) noite ( evening/night ) ( between dinner and dawn ), 
  yap , 13h and 20h . 
  sounds exactly like the portuguese ones . 
  [ battle of cochin - 1504 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cochin ) 1200 people ( portuguese and cochinese ) vs 50k + from calicut . 
  i think that at least those who are already in the uk will probably still be allowed to remain ( expect the same for uk citizens living in eu countries ) . 
  as for who comes after the `` exit '' , maybe there will be some kind of visa . 
  maybe not . 
  who knows . 
  at this point , negotiations are still in their earlt days and the near future is quite foggy as of yet . 
  last time i travelled from brussels to bruges/brugge it was mostly dutch all the way . 
  sacadura cabral and gago coutinho , i would say . 
  no one knows for certain . 
  in portugal i would say the most popular requests are the mini , m\u00e9dia and imperial/fino . 
  the mini and m\u00e9dia are both bottled beers , the difference being the quantity ( 20cl and 33cl respectively ) . 
  the imperial/fino ( same thing , different names in the north vs south ) is usually draught beer served in a 20cl glass . 
  some places can serve this in a 33cl or 50cl mug as well . 
  when it comes to the brand there are two major competitors : sagres and super bock . 
  it 's useful to specify which one you want but i guess that , depending on the region of the country , there is a default one if you do n't . 
   probably portuguese interesting . 
  i 've been to ljubljana recently and there are quite a few things that are really similar to the portuguese culture ( caf\u00e9 culture for example ) . 
  out of curiosity , what made you say that ? 
  check this out : https://www.upc.ro/internet/abonamente/connect-500/ 500mbps/20mbps for just over 10 $ in romania . 
  insane . 
   we have this terrible work culture where we tend to work far more than other european countries , it is culturally shunned to leave at the hour specified in your contract , extra hours are n't paid , etc. 
  as a result people loathe going to work and performance is abysmal you just described the work culture in portugal as well . 
  clearly he meant south africa as in the southern region of the african continent , not the country .
