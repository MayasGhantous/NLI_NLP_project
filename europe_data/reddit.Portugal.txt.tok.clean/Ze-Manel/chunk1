after today 's war ( or was it yesterday ? ), 
  i was kinda expecting it to have the danish flag ... ^ ^ pls ^ ^ dont ^ ^ kill ^ ^ me, 
  let them fight ... ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ silently ^ ^ ^ acquire ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ while ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ distracted . 
  i liked it when you had lasers firing from your eagle 's eyes against the hungarian flag xd, 
  it 's sad but no . 
  and this weekend you ca n't even go from lisboa to porto !, 
  coming this summer to a greek beach near you : [ ** towel wars ** ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02992/germany2_2992424b.jpg ), 
  summoning u/foreverjamon, 
  now a technical question for estonians : * 80 % of total load is a significant percentage . 
  what is the backup for these 80 % ? 
  or no backup and just import via interconnections ? 
  portugal 's exclusive economic zone ( and therefore search and rescue area ) is also [ quite big ] ( http://eu.oceana.org/sites/default/files/euo/portugal_eez.jpg ) when compared to our size . 
   the numbers are disastrous . 
  they vastly overestimated economic growth and tax income , underestimated expenses , stretched deficit spending to the limit , and cut investments with -70 % compared to last year . 
  similar thing happening in portugal . 
  the current government and their allies , to fulfill their promises ( give more money to public employees , raise pensions , lower taxes , etc ) are doing magic tricks with numbers and masking the real problems . 
  so , they have lowered direct taxes a little bit for some but increased almost all of the indirect taxes ; cut investment to the lowest since we are a democracy ( !!, 
  ) ; they are not paying suppliers and delaying expenses in order to mask the deficit ; the debt is increasing at a bigger rate because they are asking for more money ; etc. 
  it 's all bullshit !, 
  these corrupt pieces of shit that call themselves politicians are everywhere and doing a lot of damage still . 
  how dare you compare your inferior egg tart to our awesome and superior pasteis de bel\u00e9m ? 
  wow you are right , i totally misread that . 
  i was finding it really weird why germany would think less of us ... ... but now i 'm finding it equally weird why such dislike for germany . 
  ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ why : ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ media ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ left ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ demonize ^ ^ ^ germany ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ austerity ^ ^ ^ policies . 
  ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ needs ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ raise ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ taxes , ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ left ^ ^ ^ blames ^ ^ ^ eu/germany ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ their ^ ^ ^ fault ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ overspend . 
  i 'm sorry germany , i totally misread that :\\,

  very windy though ... makes it way more unpleasant than the heat . 
   had our king not been captured by nuestros hermanos the lusitania province would have been pretty much unified and portugal would have been stronger in the long term . 
  so ... we would have a bigger alentejo ?

  thank you for the explanation , it clears things up . 
  but if the customer can not be fully reimbursed i think both the article and the post title are ( slightly ) misleading . 
  yes , it is . 
  here :  the case relates to a complaint from the federation of german consumer organizations ( vzbv ) about budget carrier air berlin 's policy of charging a 25-euro cancellation fee on the amount to be reimbursed if a traveler cancels , or does not take their flight this is why i think the article is confusing . 
  this paragraph says the consumer will be reimbursed but will incur in a 25 $ penalty . 
  now , is it a full reimbursement ? 
  not clear . 
  but / u/platypuskeeper explained it better below . 
  i 'm confused by the article . 
   airlines were ordered on thursday by europe 's top court to increase the transparency of their airfares by individually disclosing taxes , airport fees and other charges levied to consumers . 
  this i agree . 
  not all airlines disclose the taxes and fees at first sight when selling a ticket , you need to read all of the conditions of that specific ticket to find out the restrictions and change/cancellation penalties . 
   the european court of justice ( ejc ) also ruled that carriers can no longer ** levy extra charges against customers who either miss or cancel their flights ** . 
  the ruling means airlines can no longer hide those additional charges in the airfare or cancellation fees . 
  this i do n't agree . 
  and if this ruling is kept , it will cause chaos and ticket prices will rise . 
  a simple example : * i book 10 tickets for me and my family to go from lisbon to london on a specific day . 
  one day before departure i find out that i can get cheaper flights with another carrier and save a lot of money , so i cancel my initial booking . 
  this means the first airline will leave lisbon with 10 empty seats . 
  now imagine if this behavior happens in all flights and people are able to cancel flights and get fully reimbursed without any penalty . 
  it would be literally impossible to predict yields because you could never predict how many passengers would be on your flights until they board .
