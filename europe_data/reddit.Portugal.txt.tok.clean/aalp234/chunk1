op is exaggerating immensely , there have been protests like this all over europe . 
  come visit , you 'll love it !, 
  that piece of shit never made it . 
  and the acre radios always bugged out when in it . 
  do you have a source that i could explore ? 
  i 'm interested now, 
  nah , when you want to make peace you have to burn the peace treaty . 
  that way no one can complain about it a few years later .

  hey !, 
  by the time i 'm done with this mod team , we 'll have made / r/europe great again !, 
  i have the best excellency !, 
  ^ / s , ^ thanks ^ for ^ being ^ on ^ the ^ shortlist !, 
  ^ i 'd ^ love ^ to ^ help ^ out ^ and ^ implement ^ new ^ things !, 
  hello !, 
  * mixed . 
  it may present itself as a good economic solution for the uk in the long term , but in the short term it will severely affect them , and depending on their future economic relationship with the us and japan they may never rebound . 
  being portuguese , it 's my belief that it would be beneficial for them to stay on board and work out their issues , but it 's absolutely their call . 
  * i think trump is unfit to be president . 
  however , he 's won the election , and nothing is more important than respecting the democratic principles , and as long as these principles are never put into question again ( referring to the whole thing about not respecting the result if he lost ) , then the us owes him the opportunity to lead , even if it 's just until he gets impeached ( which i think is quite likely ) . 
  * love denmark !, 
  happy little buggers . 
  * ~ ~ bit of a ~ ~ jerk , but no one can deny that he is n't intelligent and that he does n't know how to play his cards right . 
  he currently has a timer on his head and political views : i believe he new generation of russians is going to completely shake up that nation 's core principles . 
  he 's a threat to europe ( especially eastern europe ) , but the more we antagonize him the worse the whole situation becomes . 
  diplomacy is the answer to this . 
  however , i 'm not here for political opinions . 
  i moderate based on rules , not my beliefs . 
  * edit : messed up the format *, 
  ah , i 've been looking for this for a while now !, 
  & nbsp ; question | answer -- | -- where are you from ? 
  | portugal what languages can you speak fluently ? 
  | portuguese , english , spanish , french what is your usual timezone ? 
  | gmt +0 have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? 
  | i currently mod / r/mysterydungeon , a smaller but friendly community , and have been a teamspeak mod in / r/wargame 's teamspeak when it was operational . 
  i also have experience dealing with spam and abusive users by disarming the situation . 
  what do you like the most about / r/europe ? 
  | it is an amazing community that truly makes me feel as if i 'm a part of something bigger . 
  i personally think that the eu has made us all closer , as if we 're all together in good and bad , and enabled communication between the population of all the member states . 
  however , we do n't eliminate non-eu users from our discussions : in fact , we welcome them , and that makes / r/europe an even better community . 
  do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? 
  | i always work as a team with my fellow mods , but it 's important to have the ` courage ' to enact your own decisions if the situation requires an immediate answer . 
  having a balanced and always calm approach to every situation is what makes a good mod . 
  in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? 
  | they 're fair and inclusive , they limit the discussion to european news andevents while not censoring any areas i can think of . 
  what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | i 'd like to implement a month or bi-weekly '' ask europe anything '' post , where non-europeans can ask us questions about what we think of europe , and maybe more specific questions about what 's going on in our countries . 
  there are a lot of people who think that we 've become divided : by having these posts , we can allow people to clarify their questions and ask things they 're curious about !, 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? 
  | moderation is very good in this sub , but i think more mods are needed . 
  my main reason is to create more community events : possibly fun events , that bring the community together . 
  at the same time i spend a lot of time in mod queue , so i 'll cut down on the nsfw and bot spam , as well as answering modmail respectfully and effectively . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? 
  | absolutely . 
  as a mod team , our job is to make sure that discussion is fair and follows the rules , but we should not and can not limit political discussion . 
  it is against democratic principles . 
  we must make sure that respect between everyone is maintained , so that there are n't political meltdowns by users in every political thread . 
  however , here we 're enforcing the rules , not our political opinion . 
  & nbsp ; thank you for the consideration , whether i get picked or not :d & nbsp ; best regards , aalp234 --, 
  stay safe dude , good luck, 
  well there go my studies in the uk ... 
  i 'm currently finishing year 12 ( out of 13 ) and was hoping to go to a british university after a gap year . 
  i had n't even considered us or other parts of europe ... 
  i 'm literally crying at my desk right now . 
  ^ ^ iberian ^ ^ union ^ ^ confirmed ? 
  ^ ^ referendum ^ ^ needed, 
  but seriously , please stay in the eu . 
  i 'm planning to study and practice medicine in the uk and you leaving it will mess up my plans :(, 
  may i introduce / r/portugalcaralho ? 
  why does the us have a flair in the europe sub ? 
  ** mods !, 
  wait, 
  ok , / u/tnarref and / u/liptonreddit let 's chill for a bit . 
  there 's no need for personal attacks on one side , or condescendence on the other.if you still wish to continue this conversation please do so in a respectful manner . 
  hello , do you speak english ? 
   i think we may be the only competing nation to hate our entry every year . 
  i beg to differ, 
  so be it . 
  you had to provide context for it in the comments . 
  you know this . 
  okay , here 's what we 're gon na do , pick one : 1 . 
  take this / r/europemeta , as that is where you can and should talk about your complaints 2 . 
  take this to modmail 3 . 
  move on with our lives 4 . 
  15-day metawhining ban for disregarding my previous warning about taking this issue out of this thread responding here again means picking option 4 . 
  that is not true , and you 're doing the exact same thing you were banned for the first time , which is misrepresenting the situation . 
  here 's the comment you were banned for that time : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wzoam/american_reporter_tim_pool_got_police_escort_out/dee3rox/ you were not banned for taking your issue to / r/europemeta . 
  now if you want to continue this discussion , we will do so in modmail , feel free to send a message there . 
  you do realize that you can take your complaints to / r/europemeta ? 
  the whole point of that place is for people to comment on moderation policies , so if you are unhappy , head there , spend some time creating a well reasoned argument with lots of sources and we will hear you out . 
  personal attacks are not welcome in / r/europe , irrespective of what other people say . 
  australia has already begun to take your place : they were playing the long game . 
  hello , it being pro-europe or anti-europe does n't really matter , we do not moderate based on our opinion of content . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r39nw/music_relations_between_europe_and_the_ottoman/ ) of the kind of post we 're looking for when we say we want high-quality posts .
