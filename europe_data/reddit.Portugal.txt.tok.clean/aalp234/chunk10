  salazar and the dictatorship ( estado novo ) are controversial topics here in portugal . 
  although everyone agrees that the oppression was horrible and that the colonial wars were unnecessary , there are those who say that salazar was the only reason that we were rich for most of the 20th century . 
  and they do have a point imo : do n't forget that salazar was finance minister before being first minister . 
  he knew how the country was financially and actively sought to fix it . 
  so no , portugal was n't poor ( and admittedly is n't today , the debt is different ) , but the reasons why are quite bad . 
  saudade is like ... you miss something , but your remember the good things of it , but the sad parts as well , but then it 's remembering the impact that that thing has had in your life ... 
  it 's weird to explain,

  this issue is not at an european scale . 
  it refers to a travel advisory from a uk charity , issued to uk citizens , that also criticizes the uk government .

  to be fair , he 's always had a position like this , he 's the leader of ps ( a moderate socialist party ) . 
  and in the interview he does say that the he is pro-european , which is in line with his policies .

  well yeah , saudade makes you hungry, 
  eucaliptus are at fault for most of the fires though , due to how flammable they are . 
  so still pretty bad, 
  well , we see it differently , just like we see drugs differently from how the uk sees it . 
  by imposing a cap on the maximum number of years ( 25 ) we 're not diminishing the heinous nature of the crime , we just recognize that a quarter of a century can change a person and that that person has the right to have a '' take 2 '' at their life . 
  good riddance , his check never cleared either . 
  my thoughts exactly !,
