  fortunately it has been confirmed that all air assets are accounted for and no plane has crashed , it was just the media being too quick to publish .

  yes !, 
  there is a [ eu civil protection mechanism ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en ) in place for when member states need help . 
  for this fire and as far as i 'm aware , spain has sent 2 firefighting planes under a bilateral agreement we have with them and 2 more under the eu mechanism , france has sent 3 under the mechanism and italy has also chipped in with 2 more also under the eu mechanism . 
  these are all in addition to the portuguese air assets already present , of course . 
  good point , will do . 
  this is not an appropriate topic to bring up , as you are attempting to politicize the deaths of 62 people . 
  this your first and final warning . 
  hello everyone , unfortunately the situation since yesterday seems to not be much better . 
  if any firefighters , doctors or other authorities or volunteers are reading this , thank you for your service . 
  if you know anyone in the area and want to be updated as to the state of the fire , please contact santa casa da miseric\u00f3rdia de pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o grande using the phone number +351\u00a0236\u00a0488\u00a0060 . 
  #if you are not truly in need of information due to someone you know being affected , please do not flood the phone lines . 
  as a foreigner , please contact your embassy or consulate for further information . 
  also , there have been some bank accounts started by portuguese banks , with all money going to the victims of the fire and rebuilding the area . 
  please be careful who you send your money to , double check the account numbers , some of which can be found [ here ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/pedrogao-grande/pedrogao-saiba-como-pode-ajudar-os-bombeiros-e-as-vitimas-do-incendio ) ( article in portuguese ) . 
  stay safe everyone .

  never forget the [ pink map ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ) :( this actually led to the downfall of monarchy in portugal . 
  i would n't be so sure about that , portuguese law does require fire alarms . 
  however , they can be integrated in the building itself . 
  in fact , in terms of building design , portugal has one of the most advanced fire codes in europe . 
  for example : in portugal all new buildings since the new millennia are required to have at least two stairwells , both as their own fireproof enclosures , and all entrances to said stairwells must have a little chamber with two doors due to pressure differences so as to keep the fire out . 
  in buildings with more than 9 floors , there must be `` holding areas '' scattered across the stairwells : these areas must be independently fireproof and supported in the building macrostructure ( the main bones of the building ) and must be able to hold a certain number of people for about 6-12 hours , until the firefighters can get to them . 
  uk legislation does not require all these things that the portuguese one does because these extra safety apparatuses are n't european law , they were introduced by portuguese authorities themselves and the uk never introduced anything similar . 
  source : i know an architect and a safety engineer who i just talked to about this fire . 
  please stay classy with the jokes , some are just plain offensive , and those are not welcome here . 
  i ca n't check right now , but i guess my bad , i got it from here : http://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2017-06-08-comemoracoes-de-10-de-junho-vao-durar-tres-dias, 
  unless the president is going to porto right now , there must be a mistake . 
  he just spoke in front of the military at 10:35 in lisbon . 
  indeed , should have mentioned that , that 's why i put the `` usually '' in there . 
  however , the show in lisbon always happens , even though there is a large show in porto this year it does n't mean that the show in lisbon does n't happen . 
  the military parade was at 10am in lisbon , with the president speaking at 10:35 according to expresso . 
  usually there is a military show in lisbon , with the three branches of the armed forces of the armed forces showing off . 
  the `` fuzileiros '' , our equivalent of the us marines , always impress . 
  the president and the prime minister also give speeches . 
  it 's also a national holiday , so if it were a weekday no one would be working . 
  however , since it 's a saturday , most of the bars and discos have special deals going on , so tonight everyone should be out in force !, 
  this kind of speech is not welcome on / r/europe , this is your first and only warning . 
  you can do with your time as you wish , but do remember that we are volunteer entities that act on our own accord , not directed by reddit staff in any way except through sitewide rules . 
  i 'm afraid that this `` copy-paste '' of articles is common policy throughout reddit due to the need for users to have access to the article at hand so as to be able to effectively discuss it . 
  we believe that generating an honest and informed discussion is of paramount importance . 
  complaints should be directed to reddit 's legal team directly , as any legal requests or demands sent to the / r/europe mod team will be redirected there regardless and will not be acted upon unless such a request is issued by reddit staff . 
  have a good day !, 
  indeed , but the rule is there for those who do get stuck with the paywall , as well as to allow easier access to everyone . 
  takes the op the best of 30 seconds to do it . 
  thank you for that . 
  just a reminder , whether there is a method or not , in the case of a paywall ops are required by the rules to copy paste the article into the comments regardless , 
  you are now banned from / r/europe , no dissent allowed !, 
  greekball i thought we took that one out back and burned it from time to time ? 
  we are fine with the joke , it 's just tongue-in-cheek . 
  we in the / r/europe moderation team do insist on high levels of quality for most posts and some people do n't like this , but this ensures that the sub remains healthy . 
  overall , we believe that the vast majority of our users approve of our way of running the sub , but we are very much open for feedback over on / r/europemeta from those who disagree .
