  i 'm curious , what do you guys mean exactly when you say '' siempre nos quedar\u00e1 portugal ? '', 
  is it like '' we 'll always have portugal '' in an affectionate way ?

  please no :(, 
  ok , imagine this . 
  you get credit from your bank . 
  you promise your bank you will pay it back , they say ok , they need you to pay it back so that they can invest it elsewhere , where the money is already slotted to go . 
  you also promised and signed a contract that you would contribute money to an investment . 
  then you decide to switch banks and close your account . 
  that 's fine . 
  you still owe the money though . 
  how do you see le pen 's move of distancing herself from her party after the first round ? 
  hello everyone , just a quick reminder to check out [ / r/europe 's rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and not break them . 
  as always , strictly no personal attacks between users , we will be heavily moderating this thread and handing out bans for users who break said rules . 
  that 's a bit sensationalist in my view , the country is improving a lot is no where near greece 's position . 
  we in portugal always like to complain and moan ( it 's almost traditional ) and in this case we are only looking at the negatives and not the positives . 
  i 'm afraid opiniated text posts are not on / r/europe . 
  if you care to create an unbiased , highly-researched and well-researched post considering the full set of arguments for and against federalism in europe , you are more than welcome . 
  unfortunately it does not comply with our text post rules , as text posts must be high-quality , well sourced and develop a sound argument , as well as being unbiased . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r39nw/music_relations_between_europe_and_the_ottoman/ ) of a good text post .

  i 'm afraid not , at least in most cases . 
  the '' why is it interesting ? '', 
  requirement needs to be fulfilled with a proper argument . 
  with unusual things , try to find an explanation as to why it looks unusual and then explain that . 
  remember that it needs to be your own words , not simply copy-pasted . 
  personally , [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/635cud/greece_and_turkey_made_a_big_smile_on_my_face/ ) showing greece and turkey over at / r/place . 
  too often we forget that between countries who disagree there are people from both sides who just want peace and quiet . 
  the ` context ' comments could follow any structure , but must include :  what is it ? 
  why is it interesting ? 
  how does it relate to other things in europe ? 
  so , for example , here 's '' defensive lines of europe '' : [ linha de torres vedras ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/lines_of_torres_vedras_map.jpg ) . 
  the linha de torres vedras is a defensive line consisting of forts and walls during the [ peninsular war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) , so as to defend lisbon and ensure that the enemy was never able to breach it . 
  it 's quite interesting because it was built in secrecy : the french only figured out that the line was being built when it was a few months from completion . 
  it saw action during the '' third portuguese campaign '' in 1810-1811 , as the third attempt by french forces to capture and hold portugal and its capital . 
  the main invading army of 65000 men , led by andr\u00e9 mass\u00e9na , was unable to breach the defensive line , which was being manned by portuguese and british troops . 
  thus , mass\u00e9na 's men never reached lisbon . 
  this is just an example , feel free to format it in other ways and add more information !,
