  lisbon was a mess for the two weeks after the final , at least it feels good to know what it 's like to be on the winning side . 
  hope france gets to do it to someone soon .

  op where is the source for this data ? 
  personal attacks and attacks against nationalities are not welcome here . 
  ah , you 're confusing text posts with comments . 
  [ this is a high-quality text post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r39nw/music_relations_between_europe_and_the_ottoman/ ) , the kind that we approve and encourage . 
  comments are obviously less strict , but some are obviously shitposting . 
  commenting '' hope you win '' is more than fine , commenting stuff like '' fuck off '' , '' dumbass '' or '' lol '' just does n't add anything to the thread . 
  we remove these . 
  so i guess you could say that there is a minimum quality level for comments , but the bar is very low . 
  you really have to do it on purpose to be under it . 
  well ... a shiny turd is still a turd ,

  unfortunately his post does not comply with our text post restrictions , as referenced in the rules , which state that they must be high-quality , develop an argument and be well-sourced . 
  his post was literally just a sentence . 
  we as a mod team insist on a certain level of quality for text posts , it would be incredibly unfair to all the people who also made text posts in the past and had to go back and improve them if we had let his slide . 
  easy there , you were given a clean cut reason for the removal . 
  if you insult us again it will result in a ban .

  we do contain them if they start to take over the sub though . 
  we are discussing the creation of a megathread this afternoon , please stay tuned .
