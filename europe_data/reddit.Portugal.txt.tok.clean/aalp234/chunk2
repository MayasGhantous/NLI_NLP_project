  it 's not political , but i think you can see the development of an argument , how it references sources etc. 
   vote either macron or fillon that line is a big problem for the post : it has to be unbiased to be allowed . 
  this is a lose-lose situation : as it is pro-macron/fillon some people feel that it should stay up while others think it should be removed , and if it was pro-le pen another group of users would be saying that it should stay and yet another group of users would be calling for its removal . 
  therefore , we ask for all text posts to be politically unbiased . 
  this is not the case here . 
  thank you for exposing your concerns though .

  your points are valid , i 'm going to try to address them point by point . 
  we get dozens and dozens of questions every day , so many that we need to cut them down according to some criteria . 
  this criteria is , as is in the rules , that simple questions get redirected to / r/askeurope . 
  simple questions are basically one-liners or questions which can be answered with a simple yes/no answer , although there are other things taken into consideration . 
  if someone wants to start discussion on , for example , the benefits and disadvantages of the european union , we prefer that they create an unbiased full-length and high-quality text post and contact us for approval to post it , as is also in the rules . 
  we as mods do n't control the discourse within / r/europe , that is up to the users to defend their positions and discredit others . 
  however , this must be done in a respectful manner without personal attacks . 
  once a comment insults someone , uses racist terms , etc. , for us it 's not about the position of that user but about the way in which they deliver their message , and so the comment is removed . 
  if one is respectful , you should be alright . 
  that 's all we ask . 
  the `` what do you know about country x '' sticky threads were introduced to give each country and its users a way to highlight their province . 
  they are not meant for complex political discussion . 
  while the users of sweden obviously would like to have lots of opportunities to talk about their country , it is important that everyone waits their turn so that smaller countries , e.g. 
  montenegro , also get their chance to be highlighted . 
  there is also an `` open forum '' sticky every 4th friday were you can discuss whatever you want . 
  again , we do n't control discourse , we enforce the way in which it occurs . 
  if both sides are respectful and respect the rules , everyone gets their say . 
  hope that clears up a few of the misconceptions . 
  edit : typing on a phone is hard, 
  wait what ? 
  this is n't prohibiting submissions , it 's just a place for banter and such . 
  under no circumstances are submissions being redirected here , you seem to misunderstand the point of the thread .

  hello , [ as per the rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) , this kind of question is better suited for / r/askeurope . 
  however , seeing as this thread is already very active , we 're going to make an exception and leave the thread up . 
  please just keep in mind that in the future questions like these will be redirected to / r/askeurope . 
  there 's no need for that kind of language . 
  and yes , all you had to do was wait for confirmation . 
  it 's not that hard , is it ? 
  i have no idea how people think this kind of '' joke '' is appropriate after a terrorist attack where lives were lost . 
  hello , i did not just base my assessment on a screenshot , as you may imagine . 
  i did indeed check the url , and if you notice you will find that the edit time on each version is almost 4 hours apart , thus lending credibility . 
  thank you for keeping us honest though . 
  we only delete what breaks the rules . 
  a lot of stuff broke the rules . 
  i can confirm this . 
  people please keep the reports serious . 
  that 's absolutely right , no one should . 
  shitposting and innapropriatte jokes are being heavily taken care of in this thread . 
  thank you for your proof . 
  please provide proof that this was not editorialized , or at least not intentionally . 
  oops , meant to say may, 
  it 's nsfw because it has nude women and other nudes . 
  it might be art , but it 's still nsfw . 
   disallowed submissions :  ** unlabeled ** nsfw images/videos : this refers to ** newsworthy , relevant nsfw content ** . 
  i 'm afraid this content is n't really newsworthy . 
  you might have some luck in places like / r/art though !,
