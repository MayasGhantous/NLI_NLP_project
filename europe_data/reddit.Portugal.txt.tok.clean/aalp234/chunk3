  expresso knows that from midnight of the 10th of may to midnight on the 14th of may the borders will be closed in order to allow the portuguese authorities to better control the exits and entrances in national territory . 
  the foreigners and borders service ( sef ) , the gnr ( territorially competent in the security of the monte real / f\u00e1tima area ) and the psp ( with the responsibility of the security of high entities ) proposed this measure to the mai . 
  this morning the issue was taken before the council of ministers that approved the reinstatement of border control under the schengen agreement . 
  `` the decision was consensual at the meeting between the security forces , held on march 23 in the mai , '' the expresso 's source tells us . 
  on those days , `` documentary control '' of people will be re-established before , during and after the event and there will be highly-reinforced security measures on the ground between 12th and 13th may . 
  this is not the first time that portugal has temporarily closed borders : the same happened during the nato summit held in lisbon in 2010 and in euro 2004 . 
  edit : march to may,

  grumpy what did you do, 
  personal attacks are not welcome on / r/europe . 
  to be fair , if there 's one thing that we usually have working well is infrastructure . 
  way too much and way overpriced infrastructure , but infrastructure nonetheless . 
  my friend , what is zis ? 
  we must consult with out german overlords before such a pardon is given . 
  you can discuss matters of moderation on / r/europemeta . 
  thanks for understanding , appreciate it , 
  also , it was already posted as a comment in that exact post by yourself : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62rl2o/glorious_satire_brexit_a_titanic_failure/dfosumw/, 
  the thing is , since that one already got through , we need to keep a lid on posts like these . 
  the sub is becoming a meme-den for anti-brexit and pro-brexit memes and we 're trying to prevent that from happening .
