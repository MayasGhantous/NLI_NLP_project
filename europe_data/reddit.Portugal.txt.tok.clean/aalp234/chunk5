  / r/portugal this is your spy reporting in , the infiltration has gone quite well , i 'm almost done convincing all these newbs to redirect the sub to / r/portugalcaralho, 
  i like long walks on the beach , until you trip over someone and you fall flat on your face in the sand and your phone goes in the water bucket of the kid nearby and the dad kicks you head in for getting close to his kid . 
  what , just me ?

  i do n't think i 've ever seen / u/grumpyfinn drunk , unless she types while drunk . 
  she is cheery by nature though !, 
  in my opinion it would be yuuuuuge . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tlc71/new_rule_and_moderator_qa/ddneajd/ they do n't get deleted , automod sends them our way for a manual check is all . 
  also , has a brand new account , your comments are more heavily scrutinized . 
  i just got sent a payment for protecting the illuminati 's interests , maybe they only pay on a competitive basis,
