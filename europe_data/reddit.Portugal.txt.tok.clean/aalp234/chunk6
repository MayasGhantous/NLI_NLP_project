  hello , all rules are applied equally . 
  recently , the shitposts/memes got out of hand , and we have acted against it by introducing a megathread and reminding people of the rules . 
  the nationality of a moderator does n't matter as long as they apply the rules equally in all circumstances , which is internal moderation policy . 
  thank you for voicing your concerns .
