  i think this is a positive step . 
  i 'm glad france is supporting this , which to me shows just how invested they are in making the european project succeed . 
  i 'm surprised that the uk , who had been blocking these kind of proposals from even coming to the table for decades , is now suddenly allowing them through . 
  either they 've changed their mind or brexit has completely and utterly shattered the british informal '' veto power '' when it came to military decisions in the eu . 
  which may be a good thing in the long run .

  nah , no one really minds it to be honest : it 's called a galo de barcelos by the way . 
  it is , you can get a very big fine if you do n't have permission from the local c\u00e2mara ( local authority basically ) , and you can go to jail as well . 
  the azores law is the same as the continental and madeira law , it 's a national civil and penal code  the azores and madeira are autonomous regions but with big limits to what they can enact into law,

  most brits in portugal are working in education , either in private schools or the british council . 
  the same applies to spain and france , so i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  let 's not forget foreign students . 
  i want to go study in the uk , and i feel as though the british are not taking into account the effect that brexit will have in your university system . 
  [ more than half of higher education student in the uk are eu students ] ( http://institutions.ukcisa.org.uk//info-for-universities-colleges--schools/policy-research--statistics/research--statistics/international-students-in-uk-he/ ) , and i guarantee that if you increase the price from 9000 # to 22000 # per year that number will drop to 20 % of its original value , and the french , spanish and italian unis will gladly take those students for even lower prices and similar degrees . 
  the only reason the uk is so highly regarded is because of supply and demand * at a good price * . 
  calling it now , if brexit goes ahead and prices increase the uk educational system will have to downsize massively because i doubt the chinese will compensate the loss of new students . 
  all this to say , you want guaranteed rights for your citizens , we want rights for ours and especially our students . 
  however , you have way more to lose than we do , namely your research and educational superiority which is irreparably and infinitely tied to the young eu populace .
