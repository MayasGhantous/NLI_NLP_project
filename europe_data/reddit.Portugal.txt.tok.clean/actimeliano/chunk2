  also hitler wanted to invade us . 
  on november 12 , 1940 hitler issued f\u00fchrer directive no . 
  18 . which outlined the plan to invade portugal if british forces were to gain a footing there . 
  `` i also request that the problem of occupying madeira and the azores should be considered , together with the advantages and disadvantages which this would entail for our sea and air warfare.the results of these investigations are to be submitted to me as soon as possible . 
  '' , hitler added . 
  [ 4 ] gibraltar likes madeira -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gibraltar-madeira.jpg and oh my our story is interesting . 
  i hope they had this relationship between franco and salazar to textbooks in a deeper manner . 
  thank you anyway !, 
  i am reading through and quite interesting views . 
  i will surely follow up this subject . 
  so close to here , yet it feels like it is happening in australia . 
  good luck with everything , hope it keeps non violent , wanted to show sagrada to my so in december , 
  you want to treat catalonians like kurdish ? 
  wtf dude ? 
  spain is the sum of aragon and castile . 
  they were there the whole time . 
  interesting , please do continue to post about it ( few news here , not very informative/too short ), 
  hum the only other reason i can think is the spanish ( and portuguese - . - ) armada , and that sank in the sea . 
  we are more connected than we seem to be . 
  we both had plans to invade each other . 
  salazar expected franco to fail !, 
  spain would be divided , we would invade . 
  franco was successful , so the plan failed . 
  when we got our 25 abril revolution , spain had to be democratic , there was no support from anyone anymore . 
  it is quite interesting to read about this dynamic, 
  fun fact , it was portugal who backed franco . 
  deeply sorry , we had a little hitler too . 
  ( fun fact number 2 , we were as fascists as the nazi but no one really talks about it ),

  so what will happen ? 
  does this consultation have any direct effect ? 
  panique . 
  it is called panique, 
  i would believe in elves , thor , mordor , whatever , if i lived on a supervolcano !, 
  beautiful landscapes though , 10/10 waiting for low cost from porto . 
  edit : on , not over , there are no floating cities in iceland, 
  sounds a lot like portugal to me !, 
  oh god that was really awful , i complain about the accent of our prime minister but he speaks fluently . 
  this guys were speaking spanish with very well and thank you in the middle . 
  wtsf . 
  actually seems like a nice place . 
  http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/galaicos#mediaviewer/file:galice_castro.jpg we have this things around here , i have visited some of them . 
  galleci were a celtic tribe . 
  lusitani where another tribe but they were para celtic ( most to the south , that is why our diaspora is called lusos ) . 
  galleci is obviously referring to galicia and also north of portugal ( we were united once ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallaeci bonus : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallaeci#mediaviewer/file:fonte_do_%c3%8ddolo_braga.jpg it is great to remember our origins . 
  c++ is also cool !, 
  ah yes , that is probably due to the origins of portuguese galician . 
  this area here was celtic too ( north of portugal and galicia ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_nations http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtiberians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallaeci the name of portugal itself may have a root ( the `` gal '' ending ) of celtic origin ( see : name of portugal and portus cale ) . 
  sorry did n't see !, 
  it happens  i do n't mind using english but it feels weird when i visit a country and use it instead of their native language . 
  in spain i speak spanish ( wish i knew catalan because it is very different ) , in france i try my best not to sound a retard and speak french , and i know a bit of german , but in italy i either go full derp or speak english/portuguitaliano . 
  not to speak about the netherlands , where i either used english or i would be lost in translation . 
  and that is how far i have travelled . 
  now , it would be beautiful to see another universal european language , but that is no where near possible = / . 
  ~ ~ well there is ireland ... hum ... ~ ~ interesting , what language should we use ? 
  duolingo for starters  it also improves your life in general language learning . 
  never too late to start !, 
  tried to learn irish in duolingo , failed so hard i forgot how to speak portuguese . 
  start learning that weird newspeak . 
  quite interesting !, 
  junquera looks like a viking . 
  intimidating . 
  just build a pipe from portugal or spain , and we buy it from argelia . 
  he has a really really small ... * coff * . 
  ok i am just going to avoid the joke ... 
  when they cover eu here is always mostly related to troika . 
  even after it left , it is always about troika , about what germany thinks about us , and how we suck compared to the others . 
  also about funds , and how everyone thinks the money should not be wasted , as is once was . 
  sometimes it feels eu = germany , and brussels the capital does not like us . 
  also the euro was to blame for our failure . 
  whatever merkel says makes us cringe . 
  do n't know if this is how other portuguese here feels about this , really would like to know . 
  europa universalis 4 disagrees with you , but with a few months of relationship improvement we will get there . 
  nuclear bombing lisbon is not very good for tourism .
