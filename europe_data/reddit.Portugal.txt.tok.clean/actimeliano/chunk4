  and vice versa . 
  if uk defines us as continental europeans , with no benefits for migration , it is like building a wall . 
  it says `` we do n't want you to live here '' . 
  it would be like spain putting the border control again , and limit who can live and work there . 
  why is that wall needed ? 
  and i doubt any portuguese has anything to say against the british , just pointing out the hypocrisy . 
  it is fine for us to work and live there as it is fine for the british to come and spend the golden years here . 
  feel free to feel portuguese as well , a few beers and some small talk and you are in really . 
  this mental wall against immigration is in my view pointless . 
  * edit : typos , typos everywhere . 
  portuguese/spanish working in uk ? 
  no they will steal our jobs , they should just work harder in their homeland.they are not even remotely like us !, 
  i want to retire , let us go to sintra/algarve/mallorca / barcelona because you know it is sunny and we are from eu so we can and we love their culture so much , they are just like us !, 
  something is n't right , is it ? 
  edit : typos , i need to check my brain . 
  ireland sounds nice  do you need doctors there ? 
  if they are so anti us going to work and live there i think they should get out . 
  to the british politicians : specially mister every year i spend weeks in portugal aka mr cameron : want to close the gates to your european friends ? 
  tired of nandos chicken and those filthy portuguese , unworthy of such a great empire such as yours ( * coff london city coff * ) . 
  but first think about your southern europe retirement plan . 
  good to get old in a sunny place that is not quite 3rd world is n't it ? 
  now look again at what you are saying , now look at the sunny beaches of algarve , now look at your weather and how old you are getting , now look back at cascais and the marvelous coast , now say that you want to close the borders to us again ... yeah ... no right ? 
  do not be offended my british friends , i do know that they are trying to put blame the problems of your country in eu , we all have oxes guiding our countries . 
  yeap and you could also bribe them !, 
  and it was all a matter of politics too . 
  here in portugal we also had our little super fun mega deadly inquisition . 
  at first they did nothing , we received the jewish community from spain , used them to finance us and then sent them to london along with fish and chips . 
  then after that they started burning people in terreiro do pa\u00e7o like the circus was in town every day ... : /, 
  but you are never expecting the spanish inquisition . 
  the dog is just another example xd * everything makes sense now *, 
  pudin sounds tastier . 
  repost from my post in / r/travel  so what can i say , a lot !, 
  this is just a small video i made , clearly not totally representative of my city . 
  i find hard to convince people to visit my city , unless they already visited it . 
  photos are not enough to show , since the most important part is it 's atmosphere  . 
  porto is located in portugal , a south western european nation , member of eu . 
  it was the birthplace of portucale , the predecessor of portugal . 
  for a long time it was a major trade point , with caravelas leaving our region to explore the seven seas . 
  we even have a statue of d.henrique the navigator ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5517/9181007520_d3014ff7f3_b.jpg ) . 
  then the british during the napoleonic invasions needed wine and they found out that our region had indeed great wines , just look at douro ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o3oot_hfgne/uooz94ks43i/aaaaaaaac_8/zryxwt7hmsy/s1600/portugal+-+alto+douro+wine+region.jpg ) . 
  port is a well known beverage around the world , and here is the greatest place to drink it . 
  porto ( or oporto , although it is a misinterpretation of the portuguese - we say o porto , o being the article ) , considers itself to be an undefeated city , although during the napoleonic invasions many many many people died . 
  yet we are proud that we survived and fought back , and proud of our food too !, 
  you can try a francesinha , but it is not for diabetics ( warning ! ),

  but what about the city ? 
  7 bridges cross our river connecting granite city , here they are : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/puente_don_luis_i,_oporto,_portugal,_2012-05-09,_dd_13.jpg and http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/39834785.jpg and http://vintage.johnnyjet.com/images/picfornewsletterportugalsept2006casadamusicabridge.jpg . 
  we have modern architecture like our casa da musica : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casa_da_m%c3%basica , and old historical places like our granite tower , torre dos clerigos !, 
  : http://torredosclerigos.pt/pt/ . 
  and our famous train station : http://www.feelporto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/5453234.jpg . 
  but the jewel is really the city itself , and the people . 
  take a look at our ribeira  : http://www.dezinteressante.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/porto_ribeira.jpg i hope i captivated your interest in my city , and someday in the future you visit it  official tourism website of our city : http://www.visitporto.travel/visitar/paginas/default.aspx and for portugal : https://www.visitportugal.com/en thank you for your time !, 
  not a children song i guess . 
  the roman empire is pleased . 
  oh man those amazon drones should really get the raise they ask . 
  these strikes are killing people here !, 
  what happened to him ? 
  perhaps actually try to develop the country by helping new companies to be formed , instead of just wanting everyone to leave . 
  they help the big companies , but every other startup or new enterprise gets close to zero help . 
  how do they expect new jobs to be formed in the long run ? 
  with magic ? 
  * new roads and trains without this is worthless . 
  only people that have capital can create their investments , all others , even with studies and good ideas , are to emigrate or work at mcdonalds . 
  that is the type of government we have . 
  for me that is not a solution . 
  such a lovely family , the espirito santo . 
  speech when troika returns : `` of course it will be the portuguese fault . 
  those filthy unemployed wasting money on food and shelter . 
  if they ca n't afford it they should just you know , leave the country and stuff . 
  let us raise taxes , and cut salaries , and that will make our country much better . 
  our young people should study more and work more so they can get jobs . 
  and create their own jobs with no money at all and no credit because magic . 
  and they should emigrate because f * ck you . 
  and look at us politicians , we are all super fantastic , and we deserve extra money from outside businesses . 
  and we do n't understand why young people do n't want kids , i can raise mine with 5k euros per month so they should raise theirs too with just 0.5 k euros per month or less . 
  dafuq is that ? 
  i have 3 mercedes and a house in cascais and no debt !, 
  i am awesome . 
  filthy peasants ... they should save money ! '', 
  and 99 % of us will become even poorer , and probably another 20 % will leave the country . 
  tl ; dr : we are being raped . 
  ok time to place bets . 
  you know when you read things and they sound like a log file in a fallout game . 
  well here you go . 
  i am quite sure they are just writing a script for a movie . 
  so no problem , 
  special discount season . 
  just putin the payment to enjoy . 
  i really like the french revolution . 
  except the heads falling off part . 
  you gave us basically the notion of a free and independent state from the church , something portugal only got 40 years ago . 
  that ... that ... that is actually quite catchy !, 
  i sure hope you get to find a job , or at least be given the opportunity to pursue further studies !, 
  hard working people should not be denied opportunities . 
  wish you the best of luck !, 
   and you are correct , football rivalry ... i am from fc porto , my father from benfica , you can only imagine what it is game night here xd ahah, 
  the forbidden fruit is always tastier . 
  spain took the apple away and said no no no to catalonia . 
  now they want the apple even more of course . 
  ( by this i mean people will see it as a thing they are not allowed to have , instead of something they must choose vs uncertainty .
