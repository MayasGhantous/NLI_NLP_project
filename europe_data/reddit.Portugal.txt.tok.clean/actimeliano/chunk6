  i know that feel brother/cousin ( what is the relation between portugal and spain anyway ? 
  / r/shower thoughts ), 
  not the onion ? 
  `` prior to entering politics , she was pediatrician and general practitioner '' cool !, 
  : / every body has an accent !, 
  i am quite sure that when i speak french i sound like a monkey with some zombie disease and i tried to learn really . 
  i know what fika is . 
  i have it every day . 
  snails . 
  love . 
  snails x.x source : portuguese guy . 
  seriously i usually go to france and no , no snails . 
  i wonder why . 
  wow pretty nice !, 
  must save a bit next year , maybe 2 more days . 
  are the trains useful in poland for tourism ? 
  new low cost route in lisbon so might take that one to visit poland , 
  but i also speak badly !, 
  let us all speak badly . 
  i try to speak french though , but people just do n't understand me . 
  latins tend to have brown hair and brown eyes .

  oh so your like ... like ... like us ? 
  xd i think no nation is made of super efficient robots that just live to work ( i am looking at you japan , so many fun manga , do n't tell me you just work ) . 
  edit : i do obey the red sign because i was almost hit by a bus once while riding a bike . 
  trauma you know . 
  is warsaw cool to visit ? 
  and sir just made my long night of study a bit more nice !, 
  glad to see new people wanting to come here  i forgot to put https://www.visitportugal.com/en for more information !, 
  we tend to receive tourists very well  believe me even if most americans do not want at first to visit our country , if they try it they will surely come back at least once  i think the major issue might be also the lack of flight connections , maybe when lowcost airliners start flying there things will change . 
  portugal 's tourism office should do a better job promoting , i mean the civilians do a better job than they do . 
  i myself i have nothing to do with tourism yet i always try to show portugal outside . 
  it makes me sad to know people know little to nothing =( , but i hope they love it once they visit  about the american tourists , i met an american couple once randomly in the streets of porto , they asked for advice to get to ribeira , they were impressed with the detailed short guide i gave them . 
  they seemed nice , 
  well here are the main cities and spots that i consider a must in portugal : - lisbon ( obv , get lost in the city of light -  http://www.eurosis.org/cms/files/location/lisbon/lisbon.jpg ) - sintra ( close to lisbon , beautiful castles like this -  http://deviajeporportugal.com/wp-content/uploads/portugal-sintra.jpg ) - cascais ( also close to lisbon , top spot for spies during wwii -  http://www.mindlab-group.com/en/wp-content/gallery/cascais-2011/cascais.jpg ) - porto ( the `` invicta '' , the undefeated city and my home , names the famous port wine . 
  -  http://suzyguese.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/img_0822.jpg . ), 
  - the douro valley ( a must , where the wine is produced and has this views -  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/the_douro_valley_vineyards.jpg ) - guimar\u00e3es ( close to porto , where our nation was born ! ), 
  and braga ( churches and really ancient stuff ) -  pretty close to porto and with trains . 
  - coimbra , between porto and lisboa , with one of the oldest running universities in the world -  ( - algarve ( yes , british colony * coff * vacation spot , with magnificent cities and beaches that reach top 10 yearly -  http://cdnstatic-2.mydestination.com/library/images/105_1680_948.jpg ) - madeira ( usa constitution was celebrated by drinking madeira 's wine , also the nature is stunning . 
  this island is a pearl in the middle of the ocean . 
  if you love nature , visit it !, 
  -  http://home.scarlet.be/~tsd62459/madeira/fotos/uithouw.jpg ) - azores ( now really , usa must know azores , they have a base there !, 
  also the nature and beauty of the islands and their inhabitants is amazing . 
  check -  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/2012-10-16_18-51-29_portugal_azores_george_hayes_6v.jpg ) i missed many many many many stuff that our country has , because it is absurd the amount of monuments and places we have to visit . 
  i hope i could at least motivate you to visit some of our cities  also i am sorry i could not describe porto better , people seem to love it as we do when they visit it . 
  the city itself is the jewel , it is hard to describe it , and a photo wo n't do it . 
  oh yeah that guy ... 
  but that is what i call an extremist . 
  and religion is just a motive . 
  nazis did not kill because of religion , they killed because of race , and they were extremists too . 
  can we exclude a country just because terrorist organisations that use religion as a motive to murder attack europe ? 
  they are not turk for what i can tell . 
  and many member of isis where just random dumb europeans . 
  terrorism is a far more serious question . 
  we ca n't answer to terrorism by excluding and directing hate to a sector of the population just because they are muslims . 
  we are not sheep . 
  we can distinguish . 
  hate will.only bring more hate . 
  and they have the advantage because they can just scare us . 
  murder here , bomb there , , in a few years we have anti immigration parties everywhere demanding pure europe nations . 
  and war . 
  and hate against muslims . 
  that is what they want . 
  that will weaken us and divide us and ultimately destroy europe if hate and intolerance reign again . 
  goodbye any chance of prosperity . 
  and then yes i agree with you muslims who suffered years of pain and discrimination through our hands will be at the doors of my country and spain and say this belongs to them . 
  a 1000 year joke is finally complete - . -, 
  are you using isis as a reference point to muslims ? 
  they are an organization that uses that religion as a theme to gain control of an area rich in oil for profit . 
  and need to remind you about world war ii ? 
  or the wars in the balkans ? 
  or my countries colonial wars ? 
  pretty christian killing millions for the sake of * arguments *, 
  their extremists are not compatible , but ask me and our own extremists are just as mad . 
  well yes but there are other differences . 
  roman influence is notorious in southern europe and it is absent in northern europe . 
  should that be important too ? 
  every country is different , we should n't make diversity a problem . 
  so we should not integrate some countries because they have muslim values ? 
  are you aware that some places in the balkans have muslim values ? 
  should they stay out too ? 
  there should be a way to vote ideas , not group of ideas . 
  we have instant connection now . 
  there is little excuse for not having this . 
  i am an atheist . 
  my country used to burn people in steaks because you know , nobody expects the portuguese inquisition . 
  so the question to your answer is : am i in trouble ? 
  and now with the airbridge made by ryanair between porto and lisbon , the airoute is a nobrainer, 
  we must export our food more =(, 
  can confirm , went there and ate snaks like i hated myself . 
  the please skip ahead decade ? 
  no love for cabo verde ? 
  great beaches !, 
  caipirinha anyone ? 
  w8 is n't algarve a seasonal overseas british territory ? 
  my generation is leaving portugal too . 
  no jobs . 
  no future . 
  nothing really . 
  some are lucky and i wish them the best .
