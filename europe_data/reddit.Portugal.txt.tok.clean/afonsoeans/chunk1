this is call asymmetric information war . 
  most of western media have a quite biased stance concerning russia . 
  and the russian have learned to fight with others means . 
  do n't forget saudi arabia , qatar and iran, 
  i was trying to be sarcastic . 
  i 'll have to improve my english . 
  not at all . 
  you must remember that this is part of the anti-terrorist operation ( ato ) . 
  people will no doubt be very happy . 
  imho ** now ** it 's a very bad time to propose political union . 
  if what the british make in their country do n't affect you in your country , why it is necessary that common regulation ? 
  hitler was sent to prison in 1924 , where he dictated * mein kampf * to rudolf hess . 
  hitler was named chancellor in 1933 . 
  nikolaos michaloliakos was arrested on 28 september 2013 , but released from jail after 18 months . 
  a long trial of the golden dawn is now taking place . 
  last 6 years greek parliamentary election ( partial ) results * 2009 syriza : 13 seats ( of 300 ) golden dawn : 0 seats ( of 300 ) * 2012 syriza : 71 seats ( of 300 ) golden dawn : 18 seats ( of 300 ) * 2015 syriza : 149 seats ( of 300 ) golden dawn : 17 seats ( of 300 ) in 2009 syriza was the 5th party , in 2015 the first . 
  who in 2009 would think that syriza will be the majority party in 6 years ? 
  it ca n't be ruled out that golden dawn electoral results could improve dramatically . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  thanks, 
  a good storage is needed , that 's for real . 
  it is well-known that * midsomer * is the riskiest place in europe . 
  so they are pro-putin ? 
  in fact it seems that the actual german government are against cleansing the old corrupt pasok/nd politicians . 
  varoufakis is any thing but a pasok/nd politician . 
  it 's not only spain that should be planning a timely retreat . 
  i was a sturdy advocate of the european union . 
  no more !, 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  i ca n't understand the negatives . 
  do you know what means democracy ? 
  he/she is saying the truth . 
  why this deserve downvotes ? 
  imho it is much more than fiscal matters . 
  and where are going to be taken these saved migrants ? . 
  i think that the italians are sick and tired of this type of help . 
  no , but the situation is fluid . 
  now it looks like easier to find an agreement . 
  and as asyx has pointed , this is a bad example . 
  muggins believed it was just a russian invasion . 
  on second thought , from * russian forces * to * combined russian-separatist forces * , one can see a step forward . 
  someone as the previous ministers ? 
  the far north of portugal , peut-\u00eatre , 
  the current economic model is unstable : it sucks the wealth of the lower and middle classes in favour of the wealthy , while it needs a large number of consumers with spending power . 
  as a consequence oecd countries are in crisis , and imho this crisis can not be solved without leaving aside the neoliberal myths . 
  furthermore , the european union has been kidnapped by neoliberalism , so today it serves the interests of large fortunes , and it 's not clear if it will survive the existential crisis of neoliberalism . 
  needed to strengthen the european project ? . 
  imho the most importantly thing would be to have cross-frontier european media with an editorial line that were not excessively dependent on large fortunes . 
  media to report on the reality of our peoples without caricatural distortions , and that would allow a rational and realistic discussion of european problems . 
  where this thousand of dead were from ? . 
  from east ukraine perhaps ? 
  race = / = religion, 
  so you insist in the old good [ british policy on europe ] ( https://vimeo.com/85914510 ) ? 
  what an interesting story : both of them need money to be able to fight in syria . 
  the independent is a british paper , not an american one . 
  [ history of the russo-turkish wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_russo-turkish_wars ), 
  i would like to know what * left * and * right * mean nowadays . 
  only in russia ? 
  no , you are not . 
  why ? 
  you know nothing , dinozauur, 
  and juan carlos was a children . 
  what terrorist ? . 
  call him fool , suicide , stupid ... but not terrorist . 
  welcome to / r/collapse, 
  there are previous photos at kyev , see for example : * http://www.les-crises.fr/images/images-diverses/2014/ukraine/50-armes-diverses/violence-kiev-388.jpg * http://www.les-crises.fr/images/images-diverses/2014/ukraine/50-armes-diverses/violence-kiev-106.jpg * http://www.les-crises.fr/images/images-diverses/2014/ukraine/50-armes-diverses/violence-kiev-385.jpg * http://www.les-crises.fr/images/images-diverses/2014/ukraine/50-armes-diverses/violence-kiev-217.jpg, 
  what is weird is your last paragraph . 
  imho this is related to [ the sharp rise in death rates among white middle-aged men in usa ] ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccoqfjabahukewj4jybzmv7iahuftrqkhandbtc&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nytimes.com%2f2015%2f11%2f03%2fhealth%2fdeath-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html&amp;usg=afqjcne8wud3gvgqwcfvpirln3htp-ojwa&amp;sig2=czc9o_w2ulc2li-shsdqjw ), 
  they have a soft type of capitalism , and they have oil and natural gas . 
  egypt is [ prone to collapse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1hno7v/the_hard_facts_about_egypt_that_will_determine/ ) , and the zealot nuts that abhor the infidel tourism are working restlessly to speed it . 
  what a gentleman !, 
  in the northwest of `` hispania '' there were much more [ suevi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_suebi ) than visigoths . 
  imho the prices for portugal and spain are for apartaments , not for detached houses . 
  it seems you have a selective memory . 
  * new democracy * was in power from 2004 to 2009 , and from 2012 to 2015 . 
  you have a very short memory . 
  * new democracy * ( \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ) , a liberal conservative party , was in power from 2004 to 2009 . 
  during these years the greek government took out huge loans to pay greek and foreign infrastructure companies for a wide variety of infrastructure projects , meanwhile government deficits were consistently underreported . 
  this , in addition to the $ uro constraints , is the mean reason of the current greek crisis . 
  * new democracy * was in power once more from 2012 to 2015 . 
  better said : to server corporations interests . 
  i think it is an error to point to uncle sam . 
  this is a plot of corporations against the people : european and american people . 
  canada has suffered a [ mild recession ] ( http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/joe-oliver-vs-the-recession/ ) , as its dependence of oil revenues is smaller than that for other countries . 
  in any event , is oil price the source of the russian economic difficulties . 
  ruble rate depends on oil price . 
  russian economy has the same problems that the other oil producers countries , including canada . 
  unfortunately festnest 's commentary is quite realistic . 
  the war party attacks again . 
  ( i 'm talking about the donwvote brigade ), 
  humans consumption needs can be endless , but planet earth is finite . 
  in spain , the catholic church keeps some influence over the government and the media . 
  the christians of syria have sided with the syrian government , since the victory of the opposition means their extinction . 
  that 's why the spanish media do n't regurgitate the `` western '' propaganda , keeping a more nuanced point of view . 
  and that 's why the spanish government does n't antagonize russia in the syrian front . 
  there are a lot of different people in / r/syriancivilwar , from different positions . 
  one can get a much more unbiased image of what is going there that regarding the french tv . 
  it must be said that both the `` masters '' and the slaves are from portugal . 
  i have a hunch that you are either a g\u00fclenist or a pkk supporter . 
  with your bold posts in reddit you are a trying to misguide the police .
