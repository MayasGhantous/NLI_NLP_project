work for portugal ? 
  sorry what ? 
  what , in the past 6 years , has actually improved in portugal ? 
  debt has never been higher , unemployment only remains at the current levels because of number manipulation/temporary positions/emigration ( and even the official figure is heartbreaking ) , taxes are at an all time high , medium wages allow for no savings at all ( lower wages are simply another form of servitude , btw ) and the economy ca n't create enough stable jobs to prop the country up . 
  not that portugal 's policy was any better before the troika , but all the troika did was what i feared . 
  i took care of the creditors ( aka big international banks ) and despite all the talk about reforming , did nothing but impose blind ad-hoc measures meant only to guarantee that they got their money . 
  hell , under their supervision , portugal 's biggest private bank manage to hide a gigantic fraud , despite passing all of ecb 's so-called `` stress tests '' . 
  and let 's not forget how happy they all were about gaspar , our former finance minister ( ex-sachs ) that after resigning his position stated that the policy implemented by the portuguese government and the troika had failed . 
  guess after he said that he stopped being such an authority in fiscal matters . 
  carry on , they say . 
  all this talk about the division of europe and these stereotypes about the nations that compose it are worrying me to a point where i seriously start considering whether we trully share the same values , or simply like to believe that so that we do n't go back to slitting each others ' throats over a piece of dirt . 
  technically , our first king ( d. afonso henriques ) was n't happy with just seceding from galicia . 
  he initially went on to wage offensive war on his former liege but failed , and then turned his attention south . 
  other than that , you are absolutely correct . 
  it 's just that in modern times spain is no longer a term used to define the peninsula geographically ( since it 's been claimed by castille ) and naturally the portuguese dislike being called `` spanish '' . 
  instead , people should use the term iberian , since that 's the geographic definition of the peninsula ( iberian peninsula ) and has no political connotation . 
  it may have changed by now , but in the 80s/early 90s , i learned very little about the 20th century at school . 
  it almost went from the assassination of king d. carlos , the first republic , salazar 's rise to power , and straight to 1974 , as if the times of the estado novo were some sort of taboo . 
  other than that i agree that we cover plenty of our worse deeds , and probably do n't give enough emphasis to some of the high points of our history ( such as being among the first nations to abolish the death penalty ) . 
  we do tend to polish our military deeds versus castille a bit , even if we have some credit to do it . 
  it 's not easy being the underdog of the region for 800 years . 
  this . 
  it 's probably what i hate most about our culture . 
  people have no respect for whoever 's on time and waiting for them , and in social events , everyone seems to think `` fashionably late '' means arriving 1h past the appointed time . 
  every single time . 
  i often get told by foreign clients how very unportuguese of me it is to insist on arriving at meetings 5min before the scheduled time . 
  i 'm afraid you are mistaken . 
  [ celtiberians ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtiberians ) celtic culture is one ingredient out of many that help compose galician culture , aswell as northern portugal 's . 
  music elements like bagpipes are still played today in the northwest of the peninsula .

  [ viriathus ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/viriato ), 
   any proof that they are living better than rest of india or its just propaganda from portuguese . 
  met goans that returned to portugal . 
  real goans , not europeans coming back . 
  read countless articles about india under britain and goa under portugal . 
  however , given the tone of your comment , i doubt you 're interested in actual facts , so i 'm not inclined to expand on this . 
   are you telling me local goans are incapable of developing themselves that only portuguese have some kind of power to develop people from other parts of world ? 
  obviously you lack reading skills , as i maintained throughout my post that goans were autonomous and could very well be independent . 
  not once did i imply it was due to the portuguese , in fact , i clearly stated that goans had status in the portuguese empire , proof they were regarded as highly capable , intelligent people . 
   then why does your economy lagging ? 
  now what 's that got to do with anything being discussed here ? 
  i almost feel tempted to reply to you in the same manner and mention something about sanitation and rapes , but that would ultimately be very unfair to all indians . 
  i do n't mistake the tree for the forest , and it seems to me you took my posts a bit too personally . 
  cognitive dissonance will do that for you . 
  i am trying to convey a general opinion in portuguese society , not my personal view on these matters , which would take quite a bit a to expand on . 
   i do n't see how they could 've been separate states . 
  they 're too small , and do n't have enough historical base to support nationalism . 
  [ a list of small , yet independent states . 
  ] ( http://geography.about.com/cs/countries/a/smallcountries.htm ) i 'll address the second part of your assumption next . 
   as for the claims , the regions share language , history and religion with regions around it and except for the portuguese rule they are the same . 
  konkani is spoken in goa and also as far as regions ~ 350 km away . 
  marathi is spoken in goa and also pretty much in every region surrounding goa , and even as far off as ~ 1000 km away . 
  daman & diu are pretty much really tiny , barely-populated-with-tribals fishing/tourist spots . 
  the french too ceded their enclaves , although peacefully . 
  not sure what you mean here . 
  the portuguese were in goa for nearly 500 years , so you ca n't simply neglect the influence of portuguese culture in these communities . 
  a good example is galicia , a spanish region north of portugal . 
  portuguese culture is also known as the galaico-portuguese culture due to their common roots . 
  however , after all these centuries of being separated , galicians are now closer to the spanish ( castillian ) culture than portuguese . 
  the same thing happened in goa . 
  goans had their own culture by the time they were annexed by india , a culture that was formed by both their own indian roots and european costumes/religion . 
  which brings me to the propaganda pushed by nehru , that the portuguese were colonial masters just like the english and that he 'd be * freeing * goans from the claws of the portuguese . 
  in fact , goan was more autonomous during portuguese rule than it ever was under india . 
  most of the administration was done by goans , and many goans became high society members in portugal . 
  many of these families still have relevant positions in portuguese politics . 
  so yeah , there was a lot of prejudice and a need to galvanize the indian people by * defeating * the european colonizer by invading a tiny piece of land where people were by all accounts living better than in the rest of india . 
  that is n't to say portugal has or had any rights to goa , but it certainly should give goans legitimacy to govern themselves if they chose to . 
  finally , portugal did purpose the indian government the same deal we had with the chinese . 
  transitional period , and then a smooth transfer . 
  but that would n't have much appeal to the then highly nationalistic young india . 
  looking at how macau turned out , i personally think that would 've benefited goans the most . 
  goa and macao are special cases , opposite in every way . 
  macao was handed peacefully to china in 1999 , and many of the portuguese living there returned to portugal . 
  portuguese is still an official language there but since macau is a part of china , there is n't much interactivity with the region . 
  china , however , is a big investor in portugal and has bought our public energy company , mainly due to it 's know-how in renewable energy generation . 
  in 500 years , this is likely a high point in cino-portuguese relations . 
  goa is a whole different matter . 
  there are plenty of goans and goan descendants in portuguese society , aswell as goan influence in portuguese cousine , but any and all connection with the territory of goa ended when nehru invaded . 
  portugal made a weak attempt at pushing for it 's independence later , but with no success . 
  afaik , goans still have a right to portuguese citizenship , and some in goa try to keep their connection to portuguese culture alive , but not in enough numbers to justify a formal `` relationship '' . 
  goa , daman and diu are probably the least mentioned ex-colonies in contemporary portugal . 
  my personal take is that of all the colonies , they are the only ones that got annexed by another country and did n't manage to become independent states . 
  some feel that we failed goans , even when there was literally nothing to be done . 
  it 's a complex situation since india 's claims about goa and portugal in the past were highly prejudicial and unlike china , portugal does n't regard india as a * reliable * partner . 
  * ** angola ** i 'd say there 's more of a business relationship with angola , rather than friendship . 
  many portuguese have fond feelings for the country , but many angolans still look at the portuguese as those to blame for all their problems . 
  luckily not all , and many portuguese are emigrating there to get better paying jobs . 
  some stay but most ca n't adapt to the anacronisms of angola . 
  truth be told , angola is probably the least favourite ex-colony of portugal , for more reasons than i care to develop in this post . 
  many angolans came to portugal in the past decades in search of a better education and a better life . 
  some created new roots here , others used their education and go back to work in angola 's big companies ( mostly those with connections ) . 
  * ** cape verde ** * ** s. tom\u00e9 e pr\u00edncipe ** our relationship with cape verde and s. tom\u00e9 is pretty similar in every way . 
  we 've taken thousands of people over the years and there 's big comunities of people from these countries in portugal . 
  in portugal the image of these countries is more positive than that of angola . 
  people are warmer and not so arrogant . 
  awesome countries for some vacation too . 
  * ** mozambique ** mozambique has been somewhat neglected diplomatically in recent years , despite having a big portuguese community and many portuguese of mozambique origin living in portugal . 
  recently though , portugal participated in an initiative to end military operations from renamo , with the portuguese embassador travelling to deep mozambique with other international dignataries , to escort afonso dhlakama , renamo 's leader , to maputo safely . 
  * ** guin\u00e9-bissau ** portuguese relations with the current government in bissau are strained after a chain of coups , accusations from the military ( the same that are involved in drug trafficking ) that the portuguese and angolans wanted to take over their military and more recently the forcing of syrian refugees into a tap airplane , breaking the trust of both the portuguese government and tap , which led to the decision to stop flying to bissau . 
  the situation seems to be deescalating , and flights may resume soon .
