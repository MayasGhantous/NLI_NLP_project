  this is a big deal because there are a lot of guineans in portugal that regularly fly there to visit their family . 
  * ** brasil ** portuguese consider brasil as a brotherly country , and while many brazilians still harbor confused ideas about portugal , others see it as their brethren across the atlantic . 
  portuguese consume a lot of brazilian media , so it 's natural that we understand them better than they understand us . 
  economy-wise , portugal 's main impact in brasil has been in the telecomunication business . 
  despite recent troubles , it seems that portuguese telecom giant pt is going ahead and merge with oi , south america 's biggest telecom . 
  * ** timor lorosae ** portuguese are very fond of timor , being one of the key pushers for its independence , and from the little information i can gather the feeling is mutual . 
  they have mad respect for the portuguese paramilitary police that helped keep order in the years following their independence . 
  gnr 's performance in timor was outstanding as both a peacekeeping and public relations effort . 
  no eq . 
  maybe they can say ronaldo , that 's all . 
  the reason they have joined the cplp ( comunidade de pa\u00edses de l\u00edngua portuguesa ) is because they have oil . 
  despite portugal 's opposition for years , angola , brasil and more recently timor got what they wished . 
  another oil producing country into the fold to form some sort of cartel . 
  this is despite the cplp having clear standards on admittance , among them abolishment of the death penalty , which eq . 
  guinea is yet to formally do ( they 've temporarily suspended it , despite ngos claiming otherwise ) . 
  shameful for all cplp countries if you ask me , and even if my country was strongly opposed to it , more should 've been done to prevent this . 
  guinea speaks spanish and have french as their official language aswell , despite no one speaking it , for the same reasons they now have portuguese as an official language . 
  a dictator 's bid to get international recognition . 
  which he just did . 
  [ carlos moedas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_moedas ) is formed in civil engineering but mainly worked as an economist for institutions like goldman sachs , before becoming a secondary figure in portugal 's current government . 
  firstly , though he seems like an intelligent man , he 's mainly an apologist for the banking sector and he was one of the people in government right now that lied through their teeth to get elected ( promising a huge tax decrease to stimulate the economy when they knew full well they 'd be rising them due to the troika impositions ) . 
  secondly , research , science and innovation asks for someone in contact with real science , research and innovation . 
  the only innovation mr. moedas has seen in his career has been in the derivative market . 
  and i do n't think that 's the kind of innovation we europeans are striving for . 
  all in all , a very poor choice for the job . 
   ... if they choose to do so and agree to abide by the same rules as everyone else ... of course they should fit the criteria , had said so in my post . 
  as for the government structures being a big unknown , such is the case with any new country . 
  it would probably mean a transition period for a few years and a temporary status within the eu until the dust settles . 
   no dissent allowed in the west . 
  you mean that scotland being able to vote for independence is part of the imperial masterplan ? 
  amusing . 
  well in 1974 , when portugal gave independence to its colonies , all the investment made in them was lost and a large majority of debt was written off ( almost all of it ) . 
  are you saying that because portugal built infrastructure in africa , angola , mozambique , etc did n't have a right to govern themselves ? 
  or are you saying that portugal should drive these nations to the ground because they do n't like us anymore ? 
  by your logic , if tomorrow spain decided to leave the eu it would n't be allowed to because of `` subsidies '' . 
  newsflash , the eu may have many countries by their economic balls , but it still has n't bought all those nations . 
  they still have a right to decide their own fate . 
  but i do n't see why they would n't want to join the eu , specially since they have a lot more to again as opposed to becoming an isolated island in europe . 
  the rule of law is one of the pillars of modern democratic states , no doubt . 
  however , there are plenty of times when the state approves laws that wo n't benefit and/or are not approved by most of the people , and in those cases the citizens of said state have the right to contest it imho . 
  that is to say , a madrid approved vote would be the best solution , but if they keep blocking it ( because they fear the results ) the catalans still have a right to self determination . 
  or maybe western democracies are only democracies when it 's suitable . 
  catalonia is not euskadi . 
  also , look at eta today , and what they have ( n't ) accomplished with all those deaths . 
  as in spanish killing spanish ? 
  i doubt it . 
  the wise thing to do is let people get their vote , and embrace the new nations into the eu if they choose to do so and agree to abide by the same rules as everyone else ( looking at you uk ) . 
  i understand spain can veto it , but in the long term this would only make people in catalunya resent them and would not be good for business when everything 's considered . 
  i 'm sure most scots and catalans are looking for independence , not isolationism or civil war . 
  nepotism , pure and simple . 
  it runs rampant in portugal , from high paying jobs to simple menial county jobs . 
  it 's deep rooted , and the basis for this is how portuguese culture focus on family . 
  the only reason for this to go on is because the state is not healthy . 
  checks and balances only work for those with no connections . 
  depending on your level of wealth and connections , there 's always a way out . 
  there 's a politician/banker arrested here and there , but there is n't a systemic fight against corruption because the elected officials are involved in it as well . 
  portugal 's revolution threw off a dictatorship but failed to provide competent democratic leaders . 
  we might argue that not all of them were incompetent , but most were . 
  some were even criminal in my view . 
  barroso came from this group of bad politicians , and was among the least capable . 
  trully incipient , he announced that portugal was facing trouble and then left for brussels , leaving a political crisis and portugal ( after a transition government for 6 months ) in the hands of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates , a charismatic figure that debated by talking over everyone ( which i guess people loved ... ) and that effectively gave the last push to shove portugal down the cliff , while most people cheered for him . 
  he too is suspected of taking bribes when he was minister of the environment . 
  still far away from a meritocracy , my beloved country . 
  edit : there was even a case not long ago about an administrative job offer that only had 1 applicant and , funny enough , the requirements for the job specifically matched the applicant 's cv . 
  and since people do n't really need a history degree to send and receive e-mails , the press picked up on it . 
  winter ? 
  snow ? 
  what is this ? 
  all myths perpetuated by you nords !, 
  she said that ukraine was free to join whatever organization they chose , as any sovereign country should be , and that if they chose to join the eurasion union , the eu would not try to stop it or provoke a conflict over it . 
  trust me , i dislike merkel as much as anyone , but i ca n't ignore the facts that wo n't suit my worldview . 
  i would n't go so far as saying germany should ally with russia . 
  sure , some germans are dickheads , but there are dickheads in every corner of this beautiful earth . 
  i 'm sure most germans , along with many others throughout europe have realized that while different , there 's really no escuse for everyone not to function in a friendly social manner . 
  if we are governed properly , that is . 
  i really think many germans were disappointed because they wished the russians would eventually join the big european family , but they can distinguish putin and russia . 
  and with the current regime it 's going to be hard to get along . 
  that said , i think you 're on to something there . 
  the perception of germany may be the one you mention in the us and northern europe , but many in europe regard it 's actions in the crisis as somewhat dictatorial and with a hint of punishment . 
  and this is only possible due to the imbalance in the size/productivity of different member states . 
  with that in mind , maybe a fragmentation of europe , while maintaining a union , would make it more democratic . 
  i 've read a while ago about some german states playing with the thought of becoming more autonomous , maybe a german can clarify if this is something plausible . 
  in any case , elsewhere in europe independence movements are resurging ( scotland and catalunya are the most mediatic ) , which interestingly enough manifest interest in staying within the eu . 
  from my perspective , the way things are going eu policy will be dictated by 2-3 countries at best , which will not end well . 
  as for germany and russia right now , maybe the germans should take the hard road and prepare to lose some of it 's reserves this winter , while working on reactivating their nuclear reactors . 
  honestly , ditching nuclear when they did was the worse possible decision . 
  if only portugal had invested in its own nuclear energy program in the days of salazar we would n't be in this ditch right now . 
  yes , embargo , force putin to make a hard choice . 
  come down to earth , or prepare to be china 's sidekick . 
  in case you did n't get the memo , that 's the language he understands best . 
  it 's easy to tell others to suffer hardships , it 's not that easy sacrificing yourself for the benefit of others . 
  i was astounded at the time at the lack of perspective from the general european population at what the lisbon treaty really was , at the time it occurred . 
  i particularly noticed how most governments tried to avoid using referendums , and how any negative referendum outcome ( ireland ) got repeated until they got the results they wanted ( way to go democracy ) . 
  while not estabilishing a de jure state , it does lay the groundwork for federalization . 
  it was the day the old eu died , and new eu was born . 
  the way i see it , the eu based on shared values was replaced by the real politik eu , which in my opinion makes it just about a de facto superstate . 
  all it needs to get there is having a true single foreign policy ( catherine ashton 's job did n't exist 10 years ago , it 's been in the making for a while now , and the ukrainian situation just speeds things up ) , fiscal union ( for how long have they bombarded us with this idea ? ), 
  and a single army ( again , russia almost seems to be playing into this ) . 
  the jury 's still out on if the peoples of europe trully gained anything with this treaty . 
  now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not against a united europe , yet i 'm highly skeptical about how the eurocrats are going about doing it , and even more skeptical if their endgame will translate into better justice and quality of life for all european citizens .
