  well from the portuguese pov , swedish women are not that bad either mate . 
  i guess we 're all attracted to what looks `` exotic '' to us . 
  do n't bother . 
  people with a high education deficit and little experience dealing with people from other countries tend to resort to this type of argument . 
  rest assured , i do n't take his opinion as the general opinion of czechs , and i hope people do n't mistake an idiot with a portuguese flair for the whole portuguese population . 
  our `` socialists '' insist on having companies with successive budget deficits in the public sector while privatizing profitable sectors of the state . 
  our `` liberals '' raise taxes and bailout banks at the expense of the tax paying citizens . 
  our `` scholars '' seem to think that everyone needs evaluation , but themselves . 
  our `` bankers '' think that everyone should pay 50 % of their revenue in taxes while they themselves are taxed under 15 % and still hide profits and escape taxes . 
  our `` elites '' think the people are just whining and should be happy having 1 person in the household earning 450 $ / month to feed 4 people . 
  we have arguably the best weather in the world , food is awesome , people are decent ( mostly ) , we have awesome landscapes and even better wine . 
  people do n't leave this country `` just cause '', 
  i do n't disagree with you , i 'm just arguing what it seems likely to happen considering the people in power and the general feeling of most germans . 
  i might be wrong , and i hope i am . 
  well right now only ukraine is on the line , and while they are a potential market for germany , putin is making sure it 's an expensive market to access . 
  as i 've said before , i 'd be surprised if they did it over the present conflict . 
  not because they should n't , but because of the pattern in behaviour from german leaders in the past . 
  if the conflict escalates to any eu/nato country germany will have no choice , but as we say here in portugal , that 's `` putting the carriage in front of the horses '' . 
  i 'd like to believe the eu was different than all other supervising entities in the world but the truth is , as proven by the recent economic turmoil , countries that can make a difference are mostly in it for themselves , ie : they will take actions that suits their own national interest . 
  as such , it 's highly improbable that the germans will want to embargo energy , the british wo n't clean house in london and the french will sell those shiny mistrals to russia . 
  realpolitik their defenders will argue . 
  shortsightedness imho . 
  if anything , i underlined how unlikely it would be for germany to agree to these sactions . 
  the initial if is not full caps by mistake . 
  let 's see ... 
  if the germans agree to this embargo , which as mentioned earlier is very unlikely and would also force london and paris to share a heavy burden , the russian federation 's budget and general economy will suffer a major blow . 
  this will likely affect either their military capabilities or the general population , creating a huge dilemma for mr. putin since to be able to remain a conventional threat he has been investing big in military hardware , but he needs the support of the majority of the populace to maintain a sense of unity and common purpose . 
  granted , he could - and probably would - blame the west for the deterioration of the economic conditions , but ultimately he 'd face 2 options : turn his foreign policy 180\u00ba , start dealing only with the far east and become china 's economic slave . 
  or , dramatize the internal narrative , use the escuse of sactions to justify open war with the ukraine and hope he can get a final victory to save face and complete his narrative of liberator . 
  and hope nato does n't decide to intervene in the meanwhile , which i bet they wo n't . 
  if , and i doubt he would , he attacked a nato nation , there 's no question that nato 's conventional forces would be able to send his forces back to their borders . 
  people like to fantasize about big bad russia , but it 's still a shadow of it 's former self . 
  united with a purpose , a military force purely european would have the means to utterly humiliate russia in a conventional war . 
  you can never stress enough how nato hold some of the most nastiest toys ever to be conceived by man . 
  in the end of this scenario , nato would have no need or will to invade mainland russia which would effectively negate any justification for nuclear warfare . 
  if sactions are put forth , which would surprise the cynic in me , i expect putin to throw a fit , maybe try to score some political points in the winter when he might have some leverage and let it stew , while trying not to get too ripped off by the chinese . 
  as a portuguese i 've watched this situation from the sidelines with a mix of disbelief and amusement . 
  i live 20km from the spanish border and 230km from gibraltar itself . 
  when i hear the spanish complain about gibraltar overfishing in their waters i tend to chuckle , considering how much damage was done to portuguese fisheries in the past decades by the spanish fishing fleet . 
  i 've witness a whole species of crab all but disappear in the ria formosa natural park when the spanish `` discovered it '' , which only now seems to be recovering . 
  the british then talk as if gilbratar is a `` normal '' area of administration , as if it was not a big source of contraband and money laundering ( basically all it does these days ) which does nothing for the region it 's inserted in . 
  then comes all the doublespeak about sovereignty from both sides , which at this point simply disgusts me . 
  the spanish talk as if they do n't hold ceuta , melilla and ( illegally ) oliven\u00e7a . 
  the nerve . 
  the british talk as if they did n't take the opposite stance when portugal made the exact same claims regarding ( for instance ) goa in india ( which was held for far longer than gilbraltar ever was british ) . 
  not that the portuguese would want to claim it back , just pointing out that these people only use these arguments to defend their claims , and reverse them to accuse others of colonialism . 
  according to british arguments , if you transfer a population of your country into an enclave on another country ( a whole other landmass in this case ) and proceed on asking said people if they want to keep the flag of their old country , it gives you the legitimacy to hold that territory and call it your own . 
  there 's a name for that : colonialism . 
  if you believe this argument you should then accept russia 's claim on crimea . 
  they too had a ` referendum ' ( i know , gilbraltar 's referendum did n't need to be manipulated but you get what i 'm implying ) . 
  i 'm all up for self determination but if you use that argument to annex territory ( as opposed to a community claiming it 's own independence ) you 're undermining that very principle , as countries can easily claim that self determination movements on their territory are just manipulation from a foreign power . 
  the shouting from both sides is simply ridiculous and while in principle i believe both gibraltar and the falklands should belong to the regions they 're inserted in , i make no escuses for the spanish and argentinian governments when they also act like spoiled little brats . 
  ** tldr ** : both sides are hypocrites . 
  `` one of the world 's most common habits , coffee drinking , does n't have much appeal for the portuguese . '', 
  say what ? 
  portuguese drink coffee to the point that people could say they are substance abusers . 
  if there are countries out there drinking more coffee , i assume they live on caffeine !, 
  in the end i got hungary and czech republic . 
  i 'm having trouble finding sources in english for this but our pandur deal was n't all that immaculate either . 
  we did the assembly of the vehicles so maybe that accounts for the difference in the final price . 
  however , 10 years after we ordered them , we still do n't have all the vehicles and there was a problem between steyr and a portuguese manufacturer which led to dozens of vehicles being put on hold for almost 2 years . 
  to add to all this , the deal included the return investment from steyr in the portuguese industry that was all but ignored , which led to an official investigation from our accounting tribunal . 
  as always in portugal , the burden ended up being shifted to the tax payer , no convictions or fines and the same politicians involved in the negotiations are either in a big corporation or still in the government/parlament/eu institutions . 
  you see , my friend , they trully believe in equality . 
  or rather , fucking us all in the same manner . 
  i think the ogma has just finished the last of the projected mlus but what i meant was that the government had intended to sale some and did , so for the time being i 'm guessing we 're not selling anymore . 
  that 's not to say it wo n't happen in the future . 
  portugal 's armed forces , while limited in number and budget ( go figure ... ) proud themselves in keeping up to date with nato standards and have been present in all major theaters of operations in the past decades , albeit in different conditions . 
  they trully believe that it 's their duty to pull their weight in nato , which of course is not seen positively by the portuguese population considering our current economic predicaments . 
  one leaked telegram from the lisbon embassy to the us state department went as far as stating that `` the portuguese like to play with expensive toys '' . 
  a criticism to the portuguese armed forces ' desire to operate expensive hardware , despite their economic costs . 
  just see the submarine deal we made with germany . 
  i understand the tactical justification ( considering we have to patrol one of the largest eezs in the world , but it was obvious we could n't have afforded them , and to top it off it was a shady deal ( the company that built them got convicted in greece for the same sort of antics , and i may be mistaken , but i think in germany aswell ) . 
  surprise surprise . 
  as to why they are patrolling the baltic i do n't know if it 's been something decided by the portuguese air force / foreign minister or just some routine rotation . 
  i know the portuguese government has every interest in staying quiet since they do n't mind where they get their money from , and there 's plenty of it in russia , but the portuguese armed forces are traditionally very wary of the russians since they inherited an obsessive paranoia from the days of salazar , which kept using the ussr menace to marginalize communists and appeal to the us to be supportive of his claims at the un about the ultramarine colonies . 
  seems that 's an healthy paranoia though . 
  also , despite being treated like subhumans by some of our fellow northern european governments and media , portugal understands that despite all the flaws on the european project , the only way we 're going to prosper in the next century is by working together with other europeans towards a common goal . 
  there are , of course , those who 'd take the populist way out and demand isolationism . 
  but i guess there are irresponsible people everywhere . 
  personally , i 'm glad we 're contributing even if with only a handful of jets . 
  and i 'm sure the portuguese pilots will perform any task they 're given with the utmost professionalism and standards . 
  not anymore . 
  we 've already sold 12 f16 mlu to romania for something like $ 78m liquid ( total deal including formation of romanian crews , ground teams and engineers amounts to $ 186m ) according to portuguese newspapers in last october . 
  we did upgrade them in portugal so we amortized a bit of the initial investment made in them .

  probably he means ngo but is using the acronym as it 's said on his native language . 
  in portugal , for instance ngo is ong and stands for `` organiza\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o governamental '' which is a literal translation for `` non gonvernmental organization '' . 
  just like we reference nato as otan ( organiza\u00e7\u00e3o to tratado do atl\u00e2ntico norte ) . 
  edit : typos . 
  while you are correct , it 's been 20 years since jer\u00f3nimo martins entered the polish market and i do n't think it 's serious to compare what biedronka was then , and is now . 
  many people know this ( i guess your average is different than mine ) and of course it has an impact on how you view a country ( when in doubt , look at how the us looks at countries it has business with vs those in which it has no economic interest in ) . 
  in any case , if you think most portuguese do n't know a thing about poland , what would you say they 'd know about latvia or slovakia ? 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  in fact , one of the biggest portuguese supermarket chains invested heavily in poland by opening up biedronka . 
  in fact they do n't have to look at portugal in a drop-down since poland is higher up alphabetically . 
  it 's the portuguese that have to go through poland every time they want to pick portugal . 
  it 's european territory so yes , you can visit reunion just like a french can visit madeira , and use your euros there . 
  personally , being pro-european , i 'd say a politically united europe would have to have it 's own army for geopolitical purposes , regardless of the existance of nato . 
  however , i am utterly opposed to an eu army to serve the current iteration of the european union .
