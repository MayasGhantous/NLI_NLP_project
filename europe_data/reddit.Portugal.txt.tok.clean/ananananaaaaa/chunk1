did you say `` hola '' and `` gracias '' to the taxi driver ? 
  cause if you did , that 's the cause of ramble . 
  she sounds nice . 
  i think you 're right , which explains why i found p\u00e3o de l\u00f3 at home yesterday . 
  we have [ folar da p\u00e1scoa ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vy7b8jv9bxk/t3-jpqx6igi/aaaaaaaacck/m8qnovx2yx4/s1600/folar.jpg ) , it 's bread . 
  in the north , you can find a [ different folar , with smoked meat inside ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ths3vx1ahsk/umm-cem_yri/aaaaaaaabdi/gicweddepom/s1600/dsc03684a.jpg ) . 
  it 's nice . 
  there 's also goatling , mainly roasted . 
  and do n't forget [ seafood rice ] ( http://www.centralmenu.com.pt/media/produtos/offline/39374.0.original.jpg ) , that dish from heavens . 
  i do n't know about the others , but i live in lisbon and we have like 3 or 4 starbucks , two of them downtown . 
  maybe you just missed them ( i 'm not a fan either , i 'd probably miss them too ) . 
  ah , of course . 
  that does n't seem to be a good idea . 
  i see . 
  i read that there was a law trying to keep minors and tourists away from coffeeshops ( probably because of drug tourism ) , but that did n't work so well . 
  is it decriminalized , like here in portugal ? 
  here in portugal , people are very fond of the morning shows . 
  i like the company , and i get a few laughs while i get ready for work , it 's fun . 
  i love that . 
  it feels so good just to vent and grunt a huge compound insult to the world . 
  that sounds like a poem . 
  and i had n't heard * escanifob\u00e9tico * in a loooong time , haha . 
  you forgot * `` puta que pariu '' * , which is something like * `` whore who gave birth '' * . 
  arroz de marisco ( seafood rice ) . 
  wikipedia does n't have a page in english about it , [ but this blog post explains it with pictures ] ( http://www.foodandthefabulous.com/mains/arroz-de-marisco-portuguese-seafood-rice/ ) . 
  [ just one more . 
  ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4133/5044438305_1ae75349d5_z.jpg ) and now i 'm hungry . 
  so many butts and stars hiding genitals . 
  oh , how could i forget those . 
  in `` o crime '' , even the colors are aggressive . 
  last time i looked at it , it was red and black and i bet that the news were that someone had hammered someone 's face . 
  'cause that 's what happens when you have nothing else to do . 
  edit : also , we have too many sports newspapers . 
  there 's only so much you can say about it . 
  it 's all about murders , politics , 34546456 hooker ads ( with butt pics ) and reality show stuff . 
  yoghurt as a side dish sounds interesting . 
  i had never heard of it , so i just learned something today . 
  also , i always thought that having dinner past 21h30 was a weird thing to do . 
  cobblestones feel like home . 
  we have all the wind down here . 
  take it , take it all !, 
  i wore a t-shirt today , that made me happy . 
  however , yesterday it totally smelled like october . 
  although street view is not available , these two places have enough pictures for you to see how it is . 
  [ p\u00eago do inferno , tavira ( algarve ) ] ( https://maps.google.no/maps?q=alesund&amp;hl=nn&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=62.474778,6.165218&amp;spn=0.023165,0.081711&amp;sll=62.122878,7.172668&amp;sspn=0.023598,0.081711&amp;oq=%c3%85le&amp;t=h&amp;gl=no&amp;hnear=alesund,+m%c3%b8re+og+romsdal+fylke&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=62.474878,6.165262&amp;panoid=lmghfydzzcxyc5mdzscjoa&amp;cbp=12,270,,0,0 ) [ cabo da roca ] ( https://maps.google.no/maps?q=alesund&amp;hl=nn&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=62.474778,6.165218&amp;spn=0.023165,0.081711&amp;sll=62.122878,7.172668&amp;sspn=0.023598,0.081711&amp;oq=%c3%85le&amp;t=h&amp;gl=no&amp;hnear=alesund,+m%c3%b8re+og+romsdal+fylke&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=62.474878,6.165262&amp;panoid=lmghfydzzcxyc5mdzscjoa&amp;cbp=12,270,,0,0 ), 
  of all the beautiful places we have , you chose that . 
  i was searching for an answer and found this : `` hpv vaccines offer the best protection to girls and boys who receive all three vaccine doses and have time to develop an immune response before being sexually active with another person . 
  that 's why hpv vaccination is recommended for preteen girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years . '', 
  so it 's a bit of both . 
  it 's an std and , with the vaccine , your body has the time to train an army against hpv before you get the chance to be in touch with it . 
  cool . 
  i read that it 's better to get vaccinated before you are sexually active . 
  however , it seems that it 's advisable to get it before you 're 26 years old . 
  from then on , regular check ups are more important . 
  it seems that the vaccine is not as effective when you 're older than that . 
  well , i 'm 25 . 
  this thread just made me aware that i should n't ignore this vaccine much longer . 
  next time i 'm at the health center , i 'll have to ask them about this . 
  yes , for girls born after 1992 , it 's free and highly encouraged ( it 's part of the national vaccine plan ) !, 
  for older girls , it 's also encouraged and by now i believe that almost everyone is at least aware of the importance of the vaccine . 
  however , it 's kind of expensive and not everyone can afford to pay like 80 $ per shot ( you need 3 shots - i 'm not sure about the price though , this is what google told me ) . 
  i have yet to get vaccinated against this . 
  edit : as for check ups , we have them . 
  i have a check up once a year . 
  totally free . 
  at my health center , they encourage it , especially to women who are sexually active and go there mainly to get birth control . 
  well , if you have wealthy parents , i understand that it might be different . 
  however , i still think you should pay your living expenses by helping somehow . 
  you do n't have money but maybe you can help around the house , or take care of children/pets/house sitting , i do n't know . 
  i do n't understand that . 
  if you ca n't live alone , you should n't move out . 
  i do understand that sometimes couples go through a rough patch ( maybe they lost their job or something like that ) , and i know that some move in with their in-laws for some time until they get back on their feet . 
  however , people have to contribute in some way ( at least some housework ) . 
  if you 're an adult , it ca n't be totally free , your parents have already raised you . 
  it 's not about free food and free clothes . 
  if you 're a student , that might be acceptable . 
  if you have a job and want to keep living with your parents , that 's fine , i do that as well , but it should n't be * free * . 
  i do n't know a single person who usually uses motels , though . 
  i do n't have much privacy at home , but i do small getaways for the weekend . 
  yes , the ones who always wear t-shirts with `` portugal '' all over them , and gold necklaces/earrings with the outline of the country . 
  i do n't see them much in lisboa , but in the summer when i go up north , to paredes de coura , it 's impressive how many they are . 
  ( also , the cars always have to be super expensive , so that they can show people how much money they have ), 
  here too . 
  it 's the first thing that people put on the table . 
  sometimes , * i 'm * the one feeling like an outsider because i only eat bread during breakfast or for a snack in the afternoon . 
  also , do n't disregard signs on the cliffs when you 're sunbathing in the beach . 
  rocks may fall and you will get hurt . 
  i know the shade is pretty tempting there , but just do n't risk it . 
  this is also for residents , who disregard the signs because `` it 's worth the risk '' . 
  portugal !, 
  it 's not the first time someone asks us to send postcards to a so , i always love to participate :d, 
  hey , sure !, 
  pm me . 
  where are you both from ? 
  the act of shitting is always free , it 's your ass . 
  bathrooms may not be free . 
  hey , of course there will always be other options . 
  we 're talking about * real * bathrooms , not the whole world as a toilet ( that is already a given ) . 
  it 's a recent thing , i guess , at least on the beaches i use to go . 
  and yeah , you 're right .
