   there are only 3 secular constitutions in the whole world , france , ireland and turkey til that my constitution is not secular . 
  my whole life was a lie . 
   spaniards , portuguese , southern italians and greeks are n't considered white or european anymore from what i 've learned it depends . 
  when is to glorify the marvellous superiority of european empires we sure as hell fit the white bill . 
  the other would 've last 1000 years also if it was n't for the damn ruskies . 
   and i 'm not counting successful independence wars  portugal ** triggered **, 
  yeah , i think it 's a common opinion of the language . 
  portuguese is also strange for most non-speakers given the general use of nasal sounds and closed vowels . 
  not many language use that much of throat sounds . 
  we use the throat sounds in very few cases . 
  the rr sound like in the word guerra ( war ) is one example , which funny enough it 's a germanic word . 
  i just imagine myself trying to learn dutch and having to sip some water after a couple of minutes to ease my sore throat . 
  and do n't forget that some assholes decided to name a mobile phone tariff `` wtf '' . 
  supposedly the initials are to be pronounced in portuguese , by i , frequently user of the interwebz , manage to say `` what the fuck '' in some vary formal occasions when talking about that damn package . 
  nice of him . 
  but on an unrelated topic how do you dutch fellas manage to not get throat cancer by speaking like that ? 
  damn !, 
   the real problem lays in trying to integrate non-european you have many of people from outside europe , but mostly are from our ex-colonies , which helps . 
  also most are from a christian background , although we have a significant muslim community specially coming from guinea-bissau . 
  i think the key is not segregate people like it happens on france and belgium . 
  even if they have good conditions , houses , etc , having a big neighbourhood with only `` your type '' is terrible for integration and causes big problems down the line . 
  do n't let porn fool you , women generally are not addicted to blasts to the face . 
  i think most can provide their own semen sample . 
  * could * * you * * please * * just * * jizz * * into * * my * * mouth ? 
  * * i * * flying * * to * * france . 
  * american women before boarding . 
  he would n't count as foreign . 
  neither would be if your wife was german ( or any other nationality ) if one of you had acquire the portuguese nationality . 
  speaking of nt you can see that most players with a `` foreign background '' feel portuguese as they sing the anthem with emotion , something you sometimes do n't see , as is quite clear in the french team , for instance . 
   99 % portuguese not really . 
  the reason portugal always comes up one of the most homogeneous countries in europe is based on the fact that we do n't collect neither ethnicity or race data in our census . 
  even second generation citizens are count in the same way as portuguese as anyone else . 
  i know many people who have a spanish , french , english parent or grandparent , plus there 's a sizeable roma community and very significant people from ex-colonies . 
  we simple integrate people fairly well , as most people do n't give a shit where you from . 
  sure there 's racism and social exclusion , but compared to other countries i think that in general portugal has a lot less of those issues . 
   ethno-centric calling russia a ethno-centric negates the fact that russia is in fact one of the countries that recognizes and grants more autonomy to their minorities , specially regarding languages . 
  is that a big push for the russian language ? 
  yes , there is . 
  but nothing different that what happens in every country where the majority language is propelled by the state . 
  you do n't have to go any further that your own country , where the push for standardisation basically killed a ton of `` dialects '' ( more like autonomous languages ) in the not so distant past . 
  boss , is that you ? 
  i 'm totally not on reddit . 
  flairs can be picked by anyone . 
  not knowing or not willing to know the language of the country of destiny is a true sign of an anglo . 
  put the two together and you have the confirmation that he 's a true brit . 
  100 % scientifically approved, 
  tell that to my boss . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ please !, 
   just ca n't speak the bloody language . 
  brit confirmed . 
  soviet leaders and military were n't all russians . 
  many of the people imprisoned in the gulags were russians . 
  calling them russian gulags ignores the complex system that was the ussr , which it 's clearly what you are trying to do . 
   the concentration camps were in russia . 
  so there is no factual mistake in calling the gulags russian , because they were yeah , just like those polish death camps . 
  [ there 's this nice documentary that showcases the life there , although is from 2005 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lealr3ojuca ) . 
  had to scrolled over your flair to see what the fuck were you talking about , 
  portugal was neutral in wwii , but was involved in 3-front colonial war that had bigger costs and casualties per capita than the vietnam war for the us . 
  also contrary to italy and greece ( although they had a military dictatorship ) , portugal had a fascist regime until ' 74 , so such a wide gap between the countries is significant , given how fuck up our economy was , severely lacking industrialization and still relaying too much in the agrarian sector . 
  i knew you were mongols !, 
  not really . 
  pasta means folder , but pastoso does n't mean `` foldery '' . 
  it means pasty like in spanish . 
  uff,

  thanks , geoff . 
  chouri\u00e7o is of glorious !, 
  chorizo is something you settled if there 's no other food in the house . 
  yeah right , next thing you will tell that there 's a country named `` belgium '' and another named `` finland '' ... those are all internet pranks , buddy . 
  what ? 
  do you think that they are independent ? 
  washington still reigns supreme there . 
  do n't let the pro-independence internet users fool you . 
  no matter how the south feel disconnected with washington , they are still states of the us , not countries .

   caucasus you spelled south carolina wrong . 
  yes , i 'm aware . 
  i would gladly gave my life to defend the honour and dignity of chouri\u00e7o . 
  this is r/europe , buddy . 
  not r/usa . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ flamewar, 
  yes , but speaking slowly is not enough to hold a conversation . 
  99 % of the times you and up speaking `` portunhol '' to get across you message . 
  galiza does n't really count , as there 's a language continuum between galizian and portuguese , given that both can even be considered to be dialects of each other ( were the same language some 500 years ago ) . 
  you are forgetting that the spaniards ca n't for the most part understand what we are saying . 
  portuguese has double of the phonemes , so it 's a bit hard for them . 
  i bet you would n't feel offended in the slightest if a german mp call all poles untermensch . 
  it 's all freedom of speech . 
  galiza , not our closest ally , though . 
  if you cum outside , there 's 0 chances of pregnancy .
