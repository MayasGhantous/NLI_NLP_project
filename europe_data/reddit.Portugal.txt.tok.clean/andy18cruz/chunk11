  i only tell the story after someone shows interest . 
  here you go `` god created the white , the devil the black , and the portuguese the mulatto '' . 
  i only heard a more fucked up version of that saying . 
  actually he 's just a nutjob , and not in a good way . 
  basically the portuguese version of a brazilian joke candidate that got himself elected . 
  fuck , coca-cola is fucking expensive down there . 
  finland rightfully mongolian clay !, 
  galiza was only conquered by the moors for a short period of time . 
  they did n't establish a meaningful presence there as opposite to the majority of the peninsula . 
  `` beef is when i see you . 
  guaranteed to be an icu '' . 
  they did n't really started it . 
  english only started to became the world language after ww2 and mainly because of american pop culture ( movies , music , etc. ) . 
  until then french was the language of diplomacy and the one that was used for the world to communicate . 
  i think you had more to do with that than your dad , to be quite honest . 
  damn , you guys are * berrying * this poor fella . 
  shh ... 
  it 's all polan now ... everything is going to be alright ... 
  it 's all polan ... 
  4 to 6 months minimum . 
  northern poland is protestant . 
  you make jan pawe\u0142 ii turn in his grave . 
  should be ashamed of self . 
  damn straight it is . 
  ten coffee dates , 5 movie sessions and a marriage proposal . 
  i war you !, 
  with 15k a year you can live pretty decently in portugal . 
  of course people with 500k in the bank would find that living with 15k a year to be living like shit . 
  there 's a lot of romance languages missing from this chart . 
  i do n't think every military has the budget or is willing to spend big money in primetime advertising . 
  those force for good ads used to show up in every nfl game commercial break a few years past . 
  just shows the weight that the military has in the us . 
  [ portuguese air force ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/img/215/1051/640/fun-%2000.jpg ), 
  [ i know that the capital of slovakia still has a vibe that reminds you of the old days . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ), 
  ours it 's pronounced with a strong `` r '' , imposing like a king . 
  yours is with a bit of a lisping , cuz . 
  i prefer ours . 
  no bias at all ... 
  yo , castela , drop the filthy `` y '' for the `` i '' like the rest of your peninsular neighbours . 
  stop being the odd child . 
  the uproar in portugal was regarding the many changes that made little to no sense and created orthography nightmares more than now we have to learn a new spelling . 
  if the reform was well-made and well-thought off that would n't happen . 
  that 's why many , including myself , do n't use the new ao . 
  yes , it does n't mean you are going to have kids in that year . 
  however , it will delay your life for a year . 
  and if for men that is not a big deal in terms of having kids , for women it 's another year removed from their very small window , which is shorter given how societies and economies work nowadays, 
  i really do n't think women 's conscription is a good idea in european nations . 
  we have a ridiculously low levels of births per woman , which will most likely cause immense troubles in the future , specially regarding the sustainability of the welfare states . 
  having women delay their education or job opportunities for one year , six months , to serve in the military is just something that is not a very good idea . 
  many women can only have kids late in their 20 's , early 30 's , because only then they have financial stability after many years in college , internships or finding a reasonable paid job . 
  delay another year in the process is just causing more harm than good . 
  and for what ? 
  a shallow interpretation of equal rights , equal responsibilities ? 
  hey , you are getting too close , you hear me . 
  back off !, 
  still that 's not the point . 
  3.4 billion increase , they spend around 22b ( like other redditor point it out ) . 
  that 's a awful lot of money to protect a wealthy region , in which they have only an indirect interest . 
  i really do not understand what the us has to gain from all of this , outside of the military industry lobbies paying up politicians . 
  protecting their sphere of influence is good and all from a geo-political pov , but spending more in europe than all ( or most ) european countries put together does n't sound like a sound investment from the us perspective , unless there 's some catch and sure economical benefits for them . 
  morangos com a\u00e7\u00facar ( ultra shitty teenagers series that 's been running for like 10 years or whatever ) had a movie ? 
  god , i 'm so glad that i never even knew about that . 
  having cut ties with tv and being able to only watching shit on the internet has been a live saviour . 
  i was scrolling to my page and noticed that i failed to add \u00fa to the list . 
  undisputed champion , baby !, 
  yeah , the damn people from the caucasus are the worst . 
  damn , south-eastern us is gorgeous . 
  yeah , me too . 
  but the \u00f6 was used in portuguese ( from portugal ) not so long ago . 
  until 1911 , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  so it 's archaic , but not that archaic , tbh . 
  yup . 
  i guess we need to dust off the old archaic \u00f6 , that only the brazilians still use , to beat you . 
   l \u00b7 l what in the effing world is that ? 
  it 's that any word that contains that ? 
  all those portuguese accents are shared with other romance languages . 
  the only acceptable thing to put below a letter is the cedilla in the \u00c7 . 
  it is known . 
  all this \u015f\u0219\u0163\u021b is haram !, 
  we also have the \u00e2 , so i give you a pass on that . 
  we still beat you . 
  \u00e0 , \u00e1 , \u00e3 , \u00e2 , \u00e9 , \u00ea , \u00ed , \u00f3 , \u00f5 , \u00f4 and \u00e7 . hurray !, 
  you are putting the nail in the coffin right here , buddy . 
  yeah , you are weird bunch ... 
  what ? 
  fighting corruption ? 
  your romance/latin membership card might be revoked . 
  you always seemed like a romance poser with all those weird-ass unnatural characters ( \u015f\u0103\u0219\u0163\u021b ) , this might be all the prove that we need to exclude you from the club . 
  well , it maybe considered fraud , but definitely not theft , as you have a legit appropriation of the asset ( a contract of purchase and sale ) . 
  that 's not stealing , that 's defaulting . 
  nk using capitalism trickery against capitalist pig-dogs . 
  yeah , i 'm all familiar with those stats . 
  made a research a few years back on the housing situation and was amazed by such high percentages . 
  housing prices are ridiculous for most people . 
  either you have enough stability with someone to go live together with them or on your own the rent/mortgage would consume most of your wages . 
  that or we are too broke to leave the house . 
   alberto barbosa https://www.reddit.com/r/albertobarbosa/comments/3xert8/what_is_this_meme/ you learn a new shit everyday . 
   so consider it mildly nsfw if you are in an environment where you definitely ca n't have niggers written anywhere on your screen thanks mate , that was very helpful . 
  we need to annex galiza just to get that sweet sweet grass .
