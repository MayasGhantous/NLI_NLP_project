  no , thank you . 
  let any country take care of their own security and not let brussels ( i.e. , paris and berlin ) decide which wars we should fight . 
  portugal , for example , has very little to gain to be involved in future conflicts that the eu may want to fight , which are more likely be in the middle-east and eastern europe . 
  we have very little gain to be involved in such conflicts , no direct threat to us and there 's plenty of internal matters that we can channel the money instead of entering a war that does n't concern us . 
  let the big boys play their war games and if entering a particular war if the right thing to do and then we can decide to enter , instead of being tie-down to the will of nations , who again and again , have only their own interests at heart . 
  you spoiled brat !, 
  romanian is the only `` major '' romance language that i do n't understand basically nothing when is spoken . 
  i had french in school and italian and spanish are fairly easy to understand . 
  but still when i hear romanian it 's like hearing something that is really close to your language , but yet you do n't understand nothing . 
  funny thing the romance connection . 
  no , the father ( carlos i ) of the last king got killed jfk style . 
  the last king just got deposed . 
  i would n't file that as mildly offensive , more on the blatant racist category . 
  i was alluding to that . 
  `` eu '' as in `` i '' in both portuguese and romanian . 
  we share a bond that the others do n't share , 
  * trying * * to * * think * * of * * something * * mildly * * offensive * * to * * say * * to * * romanians * ... huh ... huh ... 
  no portugal ? 
  i thought we were `` eu '' buddies . 
  no , the club of countries who should n't never joined the euro . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  join the club . 
  kaliningrad feels alone on the west . 
  it would be the perfect opportunity to claim another exclave .

  must resist the urge to post a certain clip from a certain movie ... 
  too frenchie , amrite ? 
  i 'm aware , but since you are a republic now also it would n't work . 
  of course they are not a thing , they are an oblast . 
  galiza comes from the roman province gallaecia , which comes from the celtic tribes that live there . 
  both galicias having the same name is more likely only coincidence . 
  also there was a ( kingdom of ) iberia in the caucasus . 
  not really . 
  only about 5-10 % of the lexicon . 
  it 's mostly due to prominence of nasal sounds in colder regions . 
  galiza , who barely had a long-full occupation by the moors , has a even deeper , `` slavic like '' pronunciation in the galizian language ( really close relative of portuguese ) . 
  are you having a stroke ? 
  i thing he fell over his keyboard !, 
  remove crimea !, 
  rightfully russian clay !, 
  this is precisely my biggest concern with the whole refugee mess , not the fact that they are muslims that maybe will find hard to integrate in western countries or that they could in the future be radicalized . 
  we are heading for a future of automatation , where unskilled workers are less and less required , and the ones that are , are in the services businesses ( waitresses , etc. 
  ) , which demands that the worker has reasonable language skills . 
  having such a rush of unskilled workers , with no language skills suitable for the destiny countries is a recipe for disaster . 
  they will have to live extensive periods of their lifes on welfare - creating more and more tension with the locals - or minimal wages will lower or not rise accordingly to inflation to make your economy suitable for unskilled manual labour . 
  i think you are mistaken what i said . 
  i did n't claim that galizians did n't felt part of spain or that they had a bigger connection with portugal than with spain . 
  but there 's undeniable that many feel a bigger connection with the northern portugal ( at least ) than say canarias or andalusia . 
  and the same can be said of northern portugal in regards to azores . 
  your claim to understand 100 % of romance languages i feel is not true . 
  i speak portuguese and french , know fairly well castilian and could n't understand most of what catalan speaker talk in my trips to barcelona . 
  being a romance speaker does n't equal understanding other romance language . 
  there need to be a lot of study and effort . 
  i went to various regions of spain and could n't talk in portuguese because the locals could n't understand me . 
  i went to galiza and i could . 
  they spoke with me in galizian and i spoke back in portuguese , not `` portunhol '' , and we hold a good conversation with barely any need to explain what that word meant , etc. 
  actually many linguistics say that they are dialects of the same border language , in the same manner that various german dialects . 
  we can understand each-other almost 100 % , apart from some words that have no correspondence in the other language . 
  most galizians i knew did n't considered portugal just another iberian nation , and the sentiment is mutual in portugal ( and stronger in the north ) . 
  not enough to make a united nation , but more that the link that connects to spain , that is for sure . 
  yeah , there 's no logical reason from them to join portugal . 
  we share the same language ( in a border sense ) and there 's some culture links with the north of portugal , that although strong do not justify a union . 
  i personally feel connect to the galizians , but i would oppose such union , as the link between the two countries is n't strong enough to create a nation . 
  specially given how united portugal is , both political , culturally and ethnically . 
  there 's no independence movement in neither azores or madeira archipelago , so saying azorians want independence is quite the stretch . 
   one of the 4 historical personalities no one is saying that he was portuguese . 
  however , as genetic studies have proven most of the portuguese descent from the lusitanic ( and gaellician ) tribes , like the french from the gaules and the english from the britons , so it is legitimate to appropriate one of the historical figures to our history . 
  if people in spanish estremadura do the same no-one can blame them , as that region shares the same history with the centre of portugal when it comes to pre-visigothic history . 
  not on the `` mainstream '' media and general culture of people . 
  that was what i was referring too . 
  a brilliant military strategist , that led the troops in a battle which the odds of coming victorious were low , [ the battle of aljubarrota ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota ) , against castile and arag\u00f3n ( plus french troops ) , a 6.500 vs 31.000 , and maintain portugal independent from castile . 
  his contributions are n't talk about it in the country nearly as they should . 
  he basically was the one of the main reasons that portugal did n't share the same fate as countless other european nations that border a bigger military country . 
   then beg for money from merkel .

  ready to send another meme into the interwebz . 
  had to take him down . 
  it probably comes from the millions of soldiers that gave their life so the polish and others `` sub-humans '' slavs did n't end up 1/3 exterminated , 1/3 enslaved and 1/3 `` germanificated '' . 
  that is what that monument represent , the defeat of the nazism , not the 50 years of imposed communism , which was bad , but not even close to the ( realistic ) alternative .

  azulejos on the buildings . 
  that has to be portugal , mate !, 
   yeah true , but the berber ( i think ? ), 
  conquerors were pretty tolerant of jews and christians compared to the christian monarchs in iberia yes , but the vast majority of people were christians that spoke romance dialects . 
  and those could n't rose to prominent positions , had to pay extra taxes ad were second class citizens in regards with their muslims peers of the same social-economical class .
