  you know that logic has no place in here when matters of racism/genocide comes along . 
  mate , there 's hundreds of racist posts/tweets/comments made by white people towards blacks in twitter , yt , etc. 
  everyday . 
  you do n't see them rioting very often do you ? 
  what u/zyllber said was nothing of the sorts of white guilt . 
  and the opposite happens also , just to be clear that i 'm not saying that only whites are capable of being racist . 
  i wish ben carson wins the gop , just for the lolz . 
  the guy is comedy gold !, 
  duolingo is just a tool to help get a bit of some words , the structure , the syntax of the language . 
  of course you need to practice , talk , watch/listen to movies/music , etc. , read books on you area , etc. 
  you are overestimating the differences between technical terms in portuguese and spanish . 
  most have the same root , and your . 
  i do n't have a hour of formal spanish and i 've read countless papers , articles , books , phd thesis in my area . 
  i do n't considered myself a b2 spanish speaker because i never committed myself to it . 
  b2 is n't that hard to achieve to be quite honest , given how similar the languages are . 
  i 'm not saying duolingo is everything required to achieve b2 levels , but is a useful tool to give you a boost , specially given how practical and accessible it is . 
  fake !!, 
  there 's always snow in the land of always winter . 
   not even a portuguese speaker learning spanish can reach b2 by duolingo alone , and portuguese and spanish are virtually twin languages false . 
  you can get by with ease speaking spanish just by the fact that you make an effort without any type of course ( even a duolingo one ) . 
  with duolingo , just to get a bit of false friends , different words and different syntax you can get to b2 in a couple of months without breaking a sweat if apply yourself with minimal effort . 
  it 's one of the most common funny words to call a vagina/clitoris . 
  but our language is rich in that , so i supposed a person ca n't be aware of all of the terms . 
  it 's even used in one of those classic construction worker ( trolhas ) `` pick-up '' lines ( piropos ) . 
  poor expression . 
  but you get the picture . 
  out of curiosity . 
  how it 's pronounced ? 
  another language that uses the \u00f5 ... we are not alone in this world !!, 
  4 chan , you say ? 
  let me get my -------- e, 
  not the one thing that made succeed or fail . 
  rather the decisive factor that is a complete constrain to make the right/necessary reforms in order to fix the economy . 
  if you compare iceland - which their banking system completely collapsed - with portugal - which some important banks went under , but the majority survived with some help of the government - you will see one country that was further deep in shit and another who was in a bad shape . 
  but somehow the country with the worse situation is out of it . 
  i wonder what is the cause of portugal still not recovering from a crisis that happened 7 years ago . 
  guard the borders ... 
  right , more like we send troops/policemen to keep all the refugees in greece . 
  i wonder why tsipras did n't accept that deal . 
  ey , man , when you are one of the top dogs in chestnut production in europe you need to start eating them as soon as there is a little cold outside . 
  all winter , baby !, 
  i 've eaten . 
  it 's definitely worth a war over it . 
  poland can not into space . 
  space can into poland . 
  you would be excluded from the peninsula if you did n't !, 
  we have moscatel licorice too , but is not specific too any event . 
  chouri\u00e7a assada is fucking great , specially if it is made with aguardente / baga\u00e7o on some [ assadeira de barro ] ( http://www.all4uni.eu/_media/img/small/img-3057.jpg ) . 
  this first one , no . 
  sweet potato is not eaten specifically on this event . 
  but we eat it through out the year . 
  we normally eat [ chouri\u00e7a assada ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/6c/c2/25/restaurante-sereia-do.jpg ) , [ caldo verde soup ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/caldo_verde.jpg ) , and drink [ jeropiga ] ( http://c648807.r7.cf2.rackcdn.com/exkqyfrzmvvxclk_2.jpg ) and [ \u00e1gua p\u00e9 ] ( http://fotos.sapo.pt/tqz6lzhedlcccobpi66d/x435 ) . 
  that is what traditional across the country , but there 's probably some variations . 
  yeah , we do . 
  nothing better than to eat some rosted chestnuts from a vendor in the street . 
  love this time of the year . 
  always taught that magusto was exclusive to our side of the peninsula . 
  nice share . 
   turks are not culturally european . 
  neither albanians and bosnians in your view , i bet . 
  how could you left hawaiian pizza out ? 
  that shit reached portugal . 
  how about the real gdp of : france ukraine croatia kosovo oman fiji and finland ? 
   claim such such fine creatures as mine this kinda can be viewed as the type of love for sheep that only the welsh possesses , if you catch my drift . 
  welsh spotted . 
   the waves of people fleeing the country ** today ** i did n't say that the war in 80 's did n't create refugees . 
  but not the ones that are coming in the greek shores in 2015 . 
  i badly worded that sentence . 
  first , armed the mujaheddin and second invaded afghanistan . 
  not that you armed them before the war with ussr . 
  portugal , obvious . 
  only the uk is holding us back . 
  yes , damn soviets that fought in afghanistan in 80 's that are creating the waves of people fleeing the country today . 
  nothing to do with the fact that the us first armed fucking jihadists to the teeth then decided that afghanistan need those fucktards removed and that the country needed some freedom ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  [ morning commute in the balkans ... ] ( http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1206461/150904-migrants-walk-jsw-912a_9a298e1fe1489d116a00f13beaf76587.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg ), 
  the european youth should put the eyes on this man . 
  an example of the dynamic spirit required in modern times . 
  never settle for one job . 
  do as many as you can . 
  you never know the day after tomorrow . 
  what a hard working guy . 
  look at the map . 
  they are in turkey . 
  there 's 2 options : 1 ) sail a few km to a greek island ; 2 ) go north to the caucasus and follow the russian route . 
  good luck for a bunch of muslim being allowed to cross the border of russia in the caucasus . 
  so if they want to go to germany sailing to greece is the only option . 
  no matter the autumn weather . 
  unfortunately many will die in the incoming months . 
  and i fear will not be only on sea . 
  winter weather and people sleeping on some fields in the balkans is a bad combination . 
  join the club of oppressed natives that were driven out by a stronger army . 
  it 's like what russia did is different from what england did in north america or australia . 
  and basically every big country out there though out history . 
  do n't worry that will come . 
  trust me , i do . 
  but how the borders of 90 % of countries in the world were drawn ? 
  how did the us gain alta california ? 
  how did poland got most of eastern prussia ? 
  please remind me . 
  it was sure valid under the international law and had nothing to do with the fact that won their respective wars .
