  that 's it . 
  if you are right-winger or not i do n't care , but the quote i was referring too is pretty much the half-assed rethoric being used by many this days . 
  he does not have to show the program to the president , but rather to the parliament . 
  the parties , as it 's tradition and legal duty , were called one by one . 
  let 's not forget that the majority of the portuguese people voted for ps , be and cdu . 
  they are the ones that have the majority . 
  if they reach an agreement he does n't have any constitutional ground on which he can dissolve parliament . 
  you are talking bollocks when it comes to the `` totalitarism of the proletariat '' . 
  no party defends that , not even the communists . 
  that 's fearmongering rhetoric of a desperate right-winger . 
  allowing illegal workers put your working class at complete risk . 
  employers would soon stop to have a significant number legal workers , especially in some sectors of the economy , forcing people into unemployment , straining the welfare system , both from a stand point of more people need benefits and less people contributing for welfare . 
  terrible deal . 
  portugal experienced that big time in our constructing boom of the late 90 's . 
  mostly done by illegals with governments closing an eye . 
  tone of people in the real estate and politics making serious money and contributing jack shit to improving workers conditions or to the welfare system . 
  and not to mention that some will do illegal activities , raising the crime rates and making your country vulnerable to high influxes of drug trafficking , money laundering and human traffic , among other really bad things to have your country exposed to . 
  i 'm not overreacting at all . 
  costa was very clear that in a government lead by ps , the european compromises that portugal as made are not for debate , which clearly indicates that both be and cdu have made concessions regarding that . 
  so the tone of the speech is clearly out of bounds . 
  and indicates that the president is willing to cross the line of his constitutional powers and dissolve the assembly , which he can not do . 
  one thing is to allow the most voted party to try to form government , another is to prevent any other parties to do so , if the former fails . 
  they lost ? 
  you knew you voted for parliamentary elections , not government elections . 
  it 's up for the parliament to choose the government . 
  it 's a parliamentary system that portugal has . 
  it 's up to them to form a government . 
  but since portugal has a semi-presidential system , which is a branch of the latter , the president must appoint a party to form a government given the results of the elections ( and also can dissolve the assembly ) . 
  it 's portuguese political tradition to appoint the party that have won , even if they are a minority in the parliament . 
  nothing wrong in that . 
  but if that party can not form government or if the majority of the parliament rejects their program and their budget , it 's up for the second most voted party to try to constitute a government . 
  if they manage to this the president has no constitutional power to dissolve the assembly and call new elections . 
  this is what happens in all of europe , but somehow our press is calling ps `` power hungry '' and that they do n't have legitimacy to form a government . 
  people in portugal really have problems grasping what parliamentary elections are . 
  no need to send the country into a political crisis . 
  the real power hungry is our president , which not only disrespected two elected parties in his formal speech , but what 's to influence the decisions of which parties should join with another , clearly wanting ps to join or at least support psd . 
  the person that is sworn to protect and defend the constitution , it 's only role , is the one acting most against it , trying to use his formal position to influence the outcome of the political decisions of the parties that were elected . 
  but coming from the person that holds office is no surprise . 
  do n't worry guys , you will not see many people crossing into norway from russia in bikes when winter comes . 
  and winter is coming ... 
  let me guess the `` what is your gender ? '', 
  question : 90 % males . 
  5 % males portraying to be females on the internet . 
  4 % females . 
  1 % others . 
  are you sure you ai n't from wallonia ? 
  that sounded like some frenchy moves . 
  i.e. , only speaking other language other than french when there 's a girl involved and always in its broken from . 
  i do n't think any country would send military or police other than not the ones interested in maintain the refugees in the balkans , like germany , for instance . 
  the balkan states have to foot the bill of being in the route , but they would n't want any other country involved , as they would most certainty would n't cooperate in putting refugees in buses to go to the north . 
  it 's a cynical game , but it 's the one that has to be played , unless germany starts to take refugees directly from greece , saves everyone the hassle and the incoming body count when winter comes . 
  how so ? 
  first you need countries to send soldiers . 
  second , you needed balkan countries to allow other soldiers to enter their borders . 
  third , greece has nothing to gain from this . 
  neither does croatia , slovenia . 
  most people eat meat . 
  that 's a fact . 
  it 's been this way since the begging of history . 
  we are omnivorous animals . 
  eating meat is natural to us . 
  so you can say it 's just how things are . 
  in europe or in papua new guinea . 
  if you do n't eat meat you are going to have a deficiency of specific nutrients , proteins , etc , that can only be achievable by a very careful plan if you are vegetarian . 
  it 's not about excluding no one . 
  on the contrary it 's trying to included , but you can not `` sacrifice '' , for lack of a better word at the moment , the majority . 
  it 's the same with everything . 
  you are in a wheelchair and you live in a country that can not repair their old buildings , for lack of money , to make them accessible for people in wheelchair you can not access those buildings . 
  i do n't think people would mind eating vegetarian in one day , i certainly would n't . 
  but in all ? 
  most people eat meat . 
  eating meat is natural for humans . 
  vegetarians made a choice , that does n't mean everyone should follow , especially when you are talking about feed kids , teens on a public school , with normally tightened budgets . 
  you need to cater for the majority and try to include smaller groups if possible . 
  i 'm not referring to one meal , rather a daily menu . 
  one day pork , another cow , another fish , etc. 
  plenty of situations where schools can not offer an option between two dishes . 
  the point was only that religion , any religion , should n't have a say at all when it comes to schools lunches or any other matter . 
  and people that do n't eat gluten or dairy products . 
  you have to cater for them too . 
  do n't forget people that do n't eat trans fat products . 
  or salt , some people ca n't eat or refuse too eat products with salt . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  for me it 's simple , if it 's possible to give an option , then give . 
  if not , no religion should influence a decision . 
  it can not . 
  i was a typo . 
  you should read as `` vegetarian , fish options '' . 
  sometimes you can only offer one option . 
  budget cuts and all . 
  if so then you should n't have pork in schools then , because muslims do eat pork ? 
  and cow should be excluded also , given how hindus are forbidden to eat it ? 
  secularism is a basic value of our societies . 
  i 'm sure you can bring your own lunch to schools in that day , if you are forbidden by your religion to eat a certain food item . 
  i quote myself :  and a vegetarian , fish option ** should exist ** , especially if there are significant no eating a specific meat community . 
  what ** should not ** happen is having a pork-free menu . 
  if you offer multiple options , no problem . 
  if you offer only one option only and exclude pork , or other particular food , because of religious believes of a group then you are not respecting secularism . 
  eat rice and salad , like vegetarians do when there is no option . 
  and a vegetarian , fish option should exist , especially if there are significant no eating a specific meat community .
