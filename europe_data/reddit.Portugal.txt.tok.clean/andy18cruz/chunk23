  english was spread in the british empire , but the lingua franca was still the french , especially in diplomacy . 
  however , after the ww2 english gradually became lingua franca due to the us being the political and economical empire and because of their culture ( from jeans to jazz ) being spread to the world . 
  i do n't . 
  if only they had a former colony like the us that is the culture center of the world and has spread the english language via cinema , music , tv and internet . 
  rule britania indeed . 
  do n't you dare talk shit about that beautiful flag . 
  flats in donetsk are cheap , so i heard . 
  hurray !, 
  to those sweet 100 english longbowmen . 
  given the alternative , just be glad it 's the russians there . 
  i think you should read a bit on the history of the region . 
  galiza was and is the true name given by the locals in their language . 
  after the independence atempt from castille and l\u00e9on that failed in the 14/15/16 century the galician language was forbidden and persecuted and the `` official '' name changed to the castillian version . 
  the danger that galiza would join portugal was high so the castillian crown made every possible effort to destroy the culture and language of that people . 
  the nationalist movement of the late 19th century was only a return to the roots and the way that the people spoke at the time ( and still do ) . 
  so galiza is n't a name invented by the nationalist movement . 
  far from it . 
  it the name used when the portuguese and galician were still the same language so it 's the correct and historical name . 
  you have enough prove of that in historical sources and from people that speak galician . 
  moldavian people are bizarro dutch . 
  good guy kaliningrad . 
  exists solely to give poland and lithuania an easy answer on the least favourite neighbour question . 
  just fly to turkey and mingle with syrians refugees . 
  then contact a human trafficker and get on a barely afloat rubber boat with 200 people on it and sail to greece . 
  once you reach the greek shores you will be transferred to mainland and then walk something like 2 000 km to germany ( fence jumping skills maybe be required ) . 
  easy peasy . 
  damn english that use that castillian denomination instead of the locals one , 
  ** country ** : portugal ** favourite neighbour : ** galiza ** least favourite neighbour : ** spain, 
  still , a true peace can only be reached by a underwater tunnel . 
  it is known . 
  next step : build an underwater tunnel to seal the peace treaty . 
  why would russia would want the end of the war ? 
  the refugee crisis is very beneficial as a `` retaliation '' to the sanctions . 
  if anything they will help assad win more and more territories , maybe even the whole country , and force the million of displaced people that do n't want to return to syria with assad in power to move/stay in europe/germany . 
  win-win situation for putin . 
  gains more presence in the middle-east and at the same time punishes the west and now has a bargain chip to negotiate the end of sanctions . 
  we have the same saying , just a different bloke . 
  i beg to disagree . 
  true romance languages do n't pronounce j as a h and talk with a lisp . 
  just to be a dick . 
  portugal does n't neighbour the mediterranean . 
  romania you are not unique :p, 
  i get the sentiment , but is just creepy as hell in my view . 
  it 's treat him like some sort of demi-god . 
   getting trumped i see what you did there . 
  my japanese skills are great , you see . 
  more like 200 million plus country against an 11 million one . 
  it was cheaper back in the day to simply import dubbing for kids movies and series . 
  buy germans weapons and military equipment , says sch\u00e4uble . 
  that 's far fetched . 
  but still how do you justify the constant droning in yemen and somalia ? 
  under international law is n't fine . 
  but since bush , the us cares very little for the respect of international rules . 
  the so-called `` fight of terror '' umbrella allows them to attack every country without anyone batting an eye . 
  that 's whataboutism that this subreddit detests . 
  damn , sweden is closing its jails ? 
  at least it 's not importing trash anymore . 
  if you were geting pussy from tourists that visit f\u00e1tima a statue had to made in your honour . 
  so why is slovenia not in fifa ? 
  i mean no one in their right mind would pick them in fifa , but it 's still nice to have it there . 
  hurray for guillaume le conqu\u00e9rant !, 
  make-up . 
  can you please think of the young bitches !? 
  i ca n't get no action from 75 y/o barbara after her hip replacement , cuz . 
  we need some young females up in this bitch !, 
  damn , you brits are too demanding of your monarchs . 
  no , this the russian subreddit , with some uk and mexico posts . 
   for the role of king . 
  is n't the role of king in britain just to smile and wave ? 
  i think charles can do this , albeit with effort and a team of staffers constantly coach him up . 
  instead of the sea , we a have desert surrounding us . 
  pretty much the same , really . 
  after the finnish whites defeat the finnish reds . 
  remind me again how did you gain the territory that consists of finland again ? 
  it was by winning a war against the successors of the russian empire , was n't ? 
  by stealing from the rightful owner through brute force , was n't ? 
  by the same way they gain land from you . 
   you have moral ground to speak up as a humanist , and if your country subscribes to the ideas of humanism today , you have moral ground to mention it . 
  i agree . 
  the moral ground i was referring was simply for those who speak of the crimes committed by ones and fail to mention what others did prior . 
  of course , people today , even germans , can and should talk and lecture people of the crimes that were committed and the relevance of those . 
   germans , as the defeated , had to do so to a certain extent and stepped up to the plate . 
  others , as the victors , might have more to work on . 
  to be quite honest , the transformation of germany and the way you accept and confront the past is pretty impressive . 
  compare it with japan , which were in the same situation , and you simply a culture of not touching on the issues and simply ignore it . 
   got off lightly in what way ? 
  do a basic research was germans did in the soviet union and poland and then compare it with what soviet did in germany and then you can understand . 
   that not as many german civilians were killed as soviet civilians were ? 
  there were also millions of german civilian casualties and there were even more that were displaced unable to ever return to their homes forced to leave everything behind . 
  german civilian deaths range from 500,000 to over 2.0 million . 
  soviet civilian deaths : 26.6 million , minus military dead of 8.7 million . 
  as you can see the disparity is not even in the same ball park . 
   that is just not true . 
  allies targeted city centers without any military importance in the war repeatedly unless you have a very wide idea of military importance . 
  most of prussia had been barely touched by war when the soviets arrived . 
  they were too busy advancing and fighting in russia , belorussia and poland to attack and destroy most little germany towns that had n't factories , etc. 
   so then cleansing poles out of german occupied poland was also a necessary wrong doing ? 
  after all poland was the loser in that war too . 
  if you had won the war , would those poles in silesia be able to return home ? 
  please answer this question .
