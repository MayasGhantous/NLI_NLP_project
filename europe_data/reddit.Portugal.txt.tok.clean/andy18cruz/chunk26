  he rather have chicken than to pay attention to what you are saying . 
  is just me or mexico seems to surprise rape scotland with baja calif\u00f3rnia ? 
  siesta is actually a very good thing , especially in spain , which on non-costal ( and northern towns ) , is basically hell on earth . 
  there 's absolutely no breeze and temperatures go way above 40 for 4 months . 
  productivity at middays is basically non-existent . 
  of course , in modern society when you must work at least 8 hours a day ( in portugal and spain , more like 9/10 hours , plus lunch break , which is n't included ) in a big city , where commuting consumes a lot of time , it 's basically impossible . 
  or you leave work at 9pm like with happens in andalusia , which is even worst , imo . 
  not really . 
  not the typical tiles you see on houses . 
  they vary between regions , but [ this one ] ( http://st.depositphotos.com/1248018/3022/i/950/depositphotos_30229453-facade-of-a-portugese-house.jpg ) is more or less transversal to many regions . 
  the number on top of the door is the same as the traditional portuguese ones . 
  nice post , but i ca n't upvote an / s. 
  hey , our clay losing days are over !!!, 
  no way we approve of this . 
  hey , italy is n't part of the deal that we made with ireland . 
  you ai n't gon na get `` protection money '' from us , capisce ? 
  there 's no such thing as too much redheads . 
  you probably retained more celtic influence , because the anglo-saxon invasion of british isles was much later than the roman invasion of the iberian peninsula . 
  yes , there 's still some remnants of celtic languages in galizian ( and portuguese as well . 
  both languages only were separate from each other in the renascence ) . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_galician_words_of_celtic_origin ) most of the influence is in town , villages , and places ' names , though . 
  * nh *  * gn * all hail glorious * nh * !!, 
  the north and the south of portugal was heavily populated by celtic tribes , prior to the roman conquest of the iberian peninsula . 
  even the lusitani - the tribe that we most identify with , which occupy most of the centre of portugal - were a pre-celtic tribe , but had a lot of celtic influences to the point it were like they were celtic . 
  roman culture and language just basically wipe-out celtic influences , but in the north of portugal and especially in galiza there 's still some traces of celtic culture , although not enough for them to be considered part of the `` celtic nations '' . 
  all those throwaway racist and troll accounts are doing the trick . 
   rape capital aswell !, 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
  send some hot redheaded lasses and you have a deal . 
  mate , i was n't mad . 
  you are not obliged to know anything about the portuguese language . 
  just going around the stereotype that spaniards do n't know basically anything of portugal or portuguese culture , which by the most part it 's true , at least from my experience . 
  that 's all . 
  you should get your priorities straight , then . 
  that 's the most spanish answer ever . 
  you always assume that we follow your things and have zero knowledge of the differences between the languages and culture . 
  i know we are smaller country , but outside those small dots , we are one of your only two neighbours ( not counting morocco ) . 
  we ai n't ` bout them material things , boi . 
  that 's an american imperialistic lie !!!, 
  they are all in europe . 
  take that back !, 
  100 % european , bitch !, 
  would french be considered a foreign language for swiss germans ? 
  i do n't think . 
  russians need to learn estonian to have a basic communication ability . 
  the same is true for swiss germans . 
  that 's why i do n't think count them as foreign is not right . 
  of course , if the data is about the number of languages then the history is different and we would 've this discussion . 
  then the point still stands . 
  estonian for the russian estonians should n't count as foreign . 
  no probs . 
  you just corrected me . 
  that 's fine :p, 
  that was i meant . 
  forgot to put it there . 
  well if you have a quarter of your population speaking a language and your count that language as foreign , although it should n't because such a high number of speakers ( forgetting of course historical and political reason ) it simply mess up the stats , as you have a `` free '' foreign language to learn . 
  the point being that it should n't be count as a foreign language . 
  if they are only taught english at school , for example , that makes 25 % of the population learning 2 foreign languages ( en and ru ) when in fact they only learn one . 
  your country educational system is not making any efforts regarding to improve this aspect . 
  are n't 25 % of the population native russian speakers ? 
  that screws up the stats , as russian is not an official language of estonia . 
  one thing that helps a lot with fluency is to ditch the dubbing of english films and series and instead adopt subtitles . 
  portugal , for the vast majority of content ( except children programs and a few cable channels [ discovery , history channel ] ) only has subtitles and we are probably the best english speakers of the romance countries , and english is woefully taught at schools ( at least back then ) . 
  only 7 % of portuguese students learn at least 2 foreign languages ? 
  i find this hard to believe . 
  edit : add it foreign . 
  ex : do you take the kids to school ?

  that 's shortsighted view , compadre . 
  they could only call portugal to the oranges that have their place of origin in portugal . 
  the price of portuguese oranges would go through the roof . 
  we would make a fortune .

  i think you are approved to go in armenia with an alias as kostas mitroglou . 
  i see they are doing its job as a deterrent .

  shh ... take makes sound like the bad guys . 
  [ this stronk ?

   kostas mitroglu how 's your beard game ? 
  are n't you strong military allies of azerbaijan ? 
  they are in a frozen conflict with each other , so that puts turkey in opposite side to armenia . 
  plus diplomatically both countries have a cold relationship , given the lack of recognition of the armenian genocide by the turkish authorities . 
  your plan is going to face logistical nightmares because of our [ strategical placed defences ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qccncdato5q/s6_m_evbgsi/aaaaaaaabhc/9aaoaz9ggrw/s1600/jorge+roque+027.jpg ) . 
  good ... just like we planned .
