  so this is where all the `` florida man '' originates from . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  are the players trying to sing the `` right '' stanza ? 
  they do n't appear to be singing along with him . 
  it had to be done . 
  close almaraz !, 
  the languages are very similar . 
  80 % of mutual intelligibility . 
  but they struggle to understand us speaking , as we have double their phonemes and they are n't used to listen to a lot of nasal sounds . 
  you know us too well . 
  you said it 's just a normal photo . 
  i pointed to the fact that they are heavily armed and have russia in its background . 
  not a normal , everyday photo . 
  otherwise it would n't be here in this forum . 
  but not a provocation either . 
  green spot in portugal is basically alentejo . 
  the bread-basket of portugal . 
  cool thing . 
   furthermore , this is n't even that much related to military activity , just taking a picture in the town , which is absolutely normal except for the fact that they are armed to the teeth !, 
  we and italy will represent southern catholicism . 
  yeah , you right . 
  portuguese is just basically galician with centuries of culture and education . 
  do n't worry , we are just talk bad of you right in front you . 
  no biggie . 
  actually , the `` you speak brazilian '' or `` are part of spain '' are so beat down that it does n't trigger us anymore . 
  whoa !, 
  that 's probably the smallest desert in all of arabia . 
   you do understand us most of the times yes . 
  but sometimes you exagerate with the whole lisping thing and what you say sounds like gibberish . 
  just taking the piss !, 
  just found it super hilarious that someone actually have a huge outdoors billboard to campgain against the whole `` polish death camps '' in another country . 
  hey !, 
  do n't come here raining on our parade . 
  we do n't come down to your country telling you that the lord of rings is not based in ancient new zealand civilizations , but in fact is just a product of fiction books by some dead english bloke . 
  take that !, 
  sorry , i do n't speak russian . 
  sorry , but they did n't made the russia episode yet . 
  how can a country who is a big wave away from being complerely wipe-out be second ? 
  they are our bitches in football also . 
  down with the tulips , i say !,

  what s.o.s. 
  means in romanian !? 
  i hate when op 's do n't translate things in less known languages . 
  lol, 
  like learn something about portugal that you can post to try to trigger someone . 
  you can do better if you put your heart into it . 
  you are welcomed . 
  we do n't want no bloody estonians here with their tech skills and increasing wages and living conditions !, 
  lacks the true lithuanians ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ aka ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ belarusians, 
  more for us then :p, 
  portuguese cattle , best cattle !, 
  it is known . 
  looks like some portuguese cows !, 
  i 'm using swiss german . 
  speaking of coat of arms my spanish friends , can you please tell ceuta to stop using our escudo as their symbol ? 
  they are longer portuguese , so please behave accordingly . 
  i can understand more or less italian . 
  i only been to la valletta . 
  business trip with a bit of sight seeing . 
  yeah , but those are settlers , not natives . 
  does n't count . 
  you weak ass colonizers . 
  nobody even speaks your language . 
  no clay for you !, 
  true british clay !, 
  hey , i said do n't make to much noise about it and let them have it . 
  i heard falling from the window in this castle can lead patients to have weird wolf dreams and shit . 
  they even brought machinery to help them . 
  germans confirmed . 
  also on reddit i learned that estonians want to be nordic , that latvians crave for potatoes and that poles like extreminate people on concentration camps . 
  live and learn , i guess . 
  and another 1/4 would be ours !, 
  that 's because it 's rightfully british clay !, 
  yeah , you have a ton of food typically associated with southern italy . 
  also , all the water bottles are italian , which i found particullary funny , but then people told me that you do n't have really enough water to go around everybody so it was cheaper to simply import water . 
  when i went to malta it was funny as people sounded like italians , but you could n't understand shit . 
  arabic sounds so fluid in the latin script . 
  inquisition , mate !, 
  got rid of them !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ force ^ ^ ^ ^ them ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ convert, 
  go back to asia , you tartar !, 
  what are you doing !? 
  sharing 8 graphs in one post !? 
  are you insane !? 
  did n't you learned nothing about karma reaping !, 
  wow , seems alternative facts went all the way to bulgaria !, 
  you can really see that this is from a early period in bulgarian architecture , as you can really see all the central asian and mongol influences . 
  a little burning never hurt no one . 
  do n't come here with your bs excuses . 
  we all know you destroy trees by the thousands just to make your shoes !, 
  i 'm pretty sure that the french airforce has a direct line of command with the french government responsable for such decisions . 
  such direct line with the swiss government i find it more difficult . 
  maybe not , but could be a cargo plane or a militarry plane , for instance . 
  they still had a huge millitary back then , with great capabilities . 
  if the cyprus crises escalated to the point that their interests were put into risk they could intervene directly and most likely use diplomatic and economic channels to reach their goals , with the us or without it ( although of course not if the us oppose it ) . 
   the french air force has permission to escort suspicious flights into swiss airspace , but does not have authority to shoot down an aircraft over switzerland . 
  this means that it has to requested from switzerland first . 
  and if do n't have time to go to proper channels and ask for authorization ? 
  they either take the inniciative , which is illegal , or let a possible attack happen .
