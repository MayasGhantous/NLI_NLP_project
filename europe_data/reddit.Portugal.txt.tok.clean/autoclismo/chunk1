all i have to say is ... ouch . 
  that 's certainly not what i understanding of the article ( then again i 'm not a lawyer ) . 
  if those kinds of interpretations are being made , then that is horrible in my opinion . 
  as i wrote , there are two obvious consequences of we were to choose to take that path . 
  * society 's evolution would be limited by religious dogma ( which knows no boundaries ) . 
  terrible if you consider how far we 've come , and how much that meant going against religiously imposed limitations . 
  * citizens would be treated unequally , depending on their faith . 
  and the more prescriptive one 's religion , the more free from rules cards one would get . 
  i was answering to this :  do you really think a $ 30.000 fine is appropriate for following your religion ? 
  following one 's religion is irrelevant when it comes to application of the law . 
  you do n't get to say the fine is to big because your religion mandates you to break it . 
  at most what you can do is question the necessity of such laws . 
  that article mandates that there should be a strong enough justification for laws that will impose limits on religious exercise . 
  as i said , so you do n't attack religions using rubbish excuses . 
  as long the law is well founded , then you just have to follow it , as is . 
  you ca n't ask for discounts for being religious . 
  yes , it is article 9 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_9_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights and point 2 says  freedom to manifest one 's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . 
  so yes it is limited by law . 
  the article basically says laws can limit religious expression as long as you have good reason to do so . 
  the point being that you wo n't just arbitrarily , limit others religions using rubbish excuses . 
  i personally find the proviso exaggerated . 
  but as i said , still it is perfectly valid to limit others religion . 
  and this would have to be the case , because otherwise there would be two very nefarious consequences : 1 . 
  society 's evolution would be limited by religious dogma ( which knows no bookstore boundaries ) . 
  terrible if you consider how far we 've come , and how much that meant going against religiously imposed limitations . 
  citizens would be treated unequally , depending on their faith . 
  and the more prescriptive one 's religion , the more free from rules cards one would get . 
  yes it is . 
  religions can say everything and anything . 
  they may tell you to kill gay people or women who cheat , they may incite hate against others , or support breaking copyright laws . 
  it is irrelevant . 
  in a secular country , religious arguments are irrelevant . 
  you 're free to worship . 
  within the boundaries of the law . 
   for following your religion ? 
  that she was following her religion is irrelevant . 
  thanks !, 
  again regarding the status quo , this article gives a fair image . 
  http://www.club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20516:permissao-sobre-o-casamento-gay-em-angola-gera-debate it talks about negative attitudes in society , not just from the church but the bantu traditions . 
  it talks about introducing explicit protections against discrimination , and the ( unlikely ) possibility of gay marriage being introduced . 
  that is the status quo . 
  what activist news sites did write is irrelevant . 
  most just copy from each other having no idea about the reality of the country . 
  having soap operas with homosexuality themes would be tabu in portugal even just a few years ago . 
  so yes , overall on the grand scale , they are relatively progressive . 
  also yes mozambique is more progressive in terms of legislation for homosexuals . 
  but if we 're cherry picking i could really throw in crimes against albinos http://observador.pt/2016/07/02/protesto-em-maputo-contra-a-perseguicao-de-albinos-em-mocambique/ not very progressive is it ? 
  does n't make sense to focus on a single issue , and we 're talking about africa and where the country is heading . 
   but most country inherit many colonial bigotries , and homosexuality and laws against it are a good example of it . 
  i do n't think you read my answers . 
  you 're hammering on a single point , and one that is wrong . 
  here is a better example , to show where they are at right now . 
  last year an angolan soap opera , played in prime time , featured some `` gay '' kiss between two men ( just a peck really , but the whole scene is about an homosexual relationship ) . 
  https://youtu.be/81ekh-e6ufe http://www.sabado.pt/multimedia/videos/detalhe/o_beijo_gay_que_suspendeu_a_telenovela_jikulumessu.html this resulted in the soap opera being suspended for some time , a few days afte that episode . 
  they claimed `` technical reasons ' '' but everyone claimed bullshit . 
  they also apologised to people who may have been shocked with the content and said they 'd be careful to warn about more sensitive scenes beforehand . 
  and then they resumed playing the remaining episodes of the soap opera . 
  have no reason to lie . 
  homosexuality is n't illegal in angola to the best of my understanding . 
  even when it arguably was ( pre-2011 ) , it was not enforced . 
  if you read the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_angola ) for lgbt rights in angola ( ** not just the summary on top ** that claims it 's illegal ) , you 'll see that 's what it says . 
  previously , before 2011 what you really had was :  articles 70 and 71 of the national penal code contained a vaguely worded prohibition against public immorality , which may have be used to punish lgbt people for their sexual orientation or gender identity . 
  so it was n't really a law against homosexuality . 
  but it was vague and could well be interpreted that way . 
  however you 'll also see sources noting it was n't enforced . 
  namely , that same article ( which is a mess ) in the table further below . 
  however today , post 2011 , and i quote :  the penal code was revised in 2011 , to remove these laws , but the older edition of the penal code is still sometimed used by judges . 
  ( see u.s. library of congress `` laws on homosexuality in african nations . '', 
  2015 ) so the laws have been revised , all that 's left is the argument that some judges are still using the previous penal code . 
  but you really did n't see that being enforced against homosexuals anyway . 
  the article mentions titica , a rather famous transsexual artist famous all over angola . 
  here is a video : https://youtu.be/qcozjpiiicu and here is an interview in a mainstream entertainment channel . 
  https://youtu.be/s1gxaiq7gqw here is some more angolan media . 
  does it look like a repressive culture ? 
  kataleya : https://youtu.be/7gxstmmduek afrikanas : https://youtu.be/ldj_2zncz70 divas do rap : https://youtu.be/cpczcl34tkq tchobari : https://youtu.be/2mdv_3mncvm yannick afroman : https://youtu.be/dnsmr-cliss nagrelha : https://youtu.be/njxlay5dcx4 and here is some reality tv trash ... big brother angola . 
  https://youtu.be/fv3xjaalu-8 of course angola is a big country . 
  as usually there will be a difference between the more urban and the rest . 
  there is also a strong catholic influence in some segments of the population ( but while they do n't condone certain behaviours or laws they also do n't condone mistreating people ) . 
  and there will be some more `` tribal '' , for the lack of a better expression , localised subcultures . 
  but all in all society is indeed relatively progressive . 
  certainly by african standards . 
  but more than that , much of the society is very `` european like '' , again for the lack of a better term . 
  and that is becoming the dominant culture as education progresses . 
  pretty much all portuguese speaking african countries do have a willing , functioning government . 
  the only exception would be guinea bissau . 
  lots of government coups and continuous disputes . 
  right now they are still arguing over the choice of prime minister , a very delicate situation . 
  other than that , there will be flaws and problems but they are certainly willing and functioning . 
  cabo verde would probably be the best of all , very well functioning democracy and decent level of development . 
  s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and principe , which you mentioned , does n't really have any problems either . 
  angola , the government is well functioning . 
  can be criticised for being too controlled by corrupt elites , and some dictatorial characteristics , despite all being well on paper . 
  but for the most part it is a peaceful and relatively socially progressive society and the system is supposedly democratic . 
  mozambique the government also works relatively fine . 
  is having some trouble with armed insurgency , associated with the opposition party , who wants to rule over provinces where they won the electoral vote . 
  it 's a complicated matter that is being negotiated . 
  but we 've had similar insurgencies in europe . 
  for the most part the government works , even if it 's doing a shit job . 
  i 've written a fair amount on this topic . 
  to make it easier and to put things in context let me start by pasting a previous relevant comment of mine .
