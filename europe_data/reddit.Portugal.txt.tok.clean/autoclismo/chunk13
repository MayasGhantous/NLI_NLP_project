  in the last census in portugal ( 2011 ) , percentage wise ( regarding total immigrant population ) we had , * 27.8 % brazil * 9.9 % cape verde * 8.6 % ukraine * 6.8 % angola pretty sure the number of angolans did n't sky rocket to take the lead in the following 4 years .

  what makes a country safe , are the people in it , not security forces . 
  and this is why it is very important to be careful about , * who you bring * how many you bring in * how well they integrate if you exercise no filtering , bring massive amounts of people , and are unsuccessful at integrating/assimilating them ( by choice or by failure ) , then you are importing all their cultural problems . 
  this has to be wrong .

  i always get this answer and it makes no sense . 
  that is irrelevant . 
  of course it 's not magical , people may and will be able to go to these countries still , often without anyone finding out . 
  however , what this measure does , is to enable you to prosecute anyone you can prove went to these countries , rather than having to prove any terrorist acts while they were there . 
  ** `` ajuda de ber\u00e7o '' ** http://www.ajudadeberco.pt it 's a children 's institution , that cares for the most vulnerable . 
  they have homes for children aged 0-2 , others for 3-9 , and others that for children with special needs . 
  difficult choice . 
  there would be other good candidates . 
  definitely deserving of all help they can get though .

  which is why it should be forbidden to go to iraq/syria/afghanistan et al without a special permit . 
  then you could at least arrest them on those grounds . 
  it 's such an obvious measure . 
   apparently the attacker was a ** `` seventeen '' ** year old migrant surely ... he would n't lie about that . 
   actually , hitler was n't exactly democratically elected . 
  we could make similar claims about erdogan . 
  he interfered with the process by exerting control over the media , and despite being a secular state he used religion to increase his power . 
   you seem to have a preconceived bias that anything not in favor of your desired result is not really `` democracy '' . 
  right , i am not in favour in this case therefore i am not in favour in any case . 
  i 'm that guy who does to the streets asking for a couple whenever his favourite part does n't win . 
  that 's me . 
  you got me / s  fact is , erdogan is actually supported by a slight majority in turkey . 
  if you think i dispute that you have n't been paying attention . 
   you can say the means he got elected was undemocratic , but he clearly has the support of a large fraction of the turkish people . 
  hitler got a lot of support too . 
  anyway this conversation is going nowhere . 
  my point is simple . 
  democracy does n't always work . 
  and turkey is heading to become an islamic authoritarian theocracy , the biggest there is , between europe ( who 's been under attack by islamits ) and the middle east ( home of islamic theocracies ) . 
  again your just parroting one side of the story . 
  nobody is saying dictatorships are ideal . 
  simply that democracy , by itself , only means placing power on the hands of the people . 
  how that works depends on the society you have . 
  democracy does n't really have to result in peace , not in freedom , nor respect for human rights . 
  in fact people can even democratically elect leaders with authoritarian tendencies who then enact power grabs - change laws in your favour , put people you trust heading justice , reform the military to be of your trust , take control of the media . 
  erdogan has been taking such steps . 
  the country was supposed to be secular . 
  the press was supposed to be free . 
  the military was supposed to be independent of the president and protect the pillars upon which the state was built . 
  to avoid using hitler as an example ... angola 's president was also elected . 
  he 's still in power . 
  and on paper the country is supposedly a democracy . 
  like i said , this is an irrational and dogmatic relation with democracy , rather than an understanding of it . 
  i 'd you ca n't even conceive a situation where a dictatorship products better results than a democracy , you 're not even trying to think . 
  you 're just parroting a dogmatic belief . 
  wwii by the way , you had a democratically elected leader who slowly changed his powers to become an autocracy . 
  not to different from what is happening with erdogan . 
  the regime as is designed , has the military to defend the secular system . 
  that is what they were doing . 
   guess what , ** we already tried that . 
  ** you realise democracy is pretty new right . 
  most of history is n't democratic . 
  also i like how the reasoning must be that all the mess is created by the dictatorships in place , and not that the dictatorships were rather holding out against this mess . 
  much of the arab spring are sunni extremists wanting to seize power . 
  unsurprising since they are the majority . 
  you 'd only be right of putting per in the hands of those people will result in a better regime . 
  but there is no reason to believe it will . 
  rather it just helps spread saudi arabia 's influence and islamic religious radicalism . 
  i 'm disgusted by prior who defend a president just because he was democratically elected . 
  people do n't seem to understand democracy . 
  rather they have an irrational , dogmatic , almost religious perception of democracy . 
  democracy only puts per in the hands of people . 
  whether that 's good or bad depends on the people . 
  the results can even be paradoxal as the power may end up in the hands of anti democratic people . 
  there is nothing magical about democracy . 
  and yes i much rather have a secular dictator power . 
  one who can then make efforts to educate the people to shape it 's society . 
  ultimately what matters are practical results . 
  and that 's what people seem to forget to these days . 
  rather than discuss what 's good and bad in terms of real world consequences , they just tag stuff . 
  having an islamite in power , who perpetuates his position by increasing his own powers and evangelising the people , and who has a hard on for saudi arabia , is a recipe for disaster . 
  this is not what i want at europe 's door . 
   democracy in and of itself ? 
   is there such a thing as authoritarian secularism ? 
  yes . 
  china , syria , portugal ( pre-1974 ) ...  also what do you mean by secularism ? 
  separation of church and state . 
  in particular there is n't a state religion , and religious arguments are n't considered in the execution of governance . 
  the coup was expected to be because erdogan has been moving away from secularism , which the military are supposed to defend . 
  what is the way ? 
  how do you move away from an islamist government , when the government itself will promote islamisation of people ? 
  if the time comes again . 
  portugal had a military coup in 1974 , which overthrew it 's right wing dictatorship . 
  no blood was shed fortunately . 
  i 've written this many times before in other circumstances , so no bias here because of current events . 
  democracy transfers powers to the people , how well it works depends on your population . 
  i 'm not very keen on an islamist country being a democracy , no . 
  i much rather have secularity forced upon them . 
  also my understanding is that , according to turkish constitution is that 's what the military are meant to do . 
  defend secularity , more so than obey the president .
