  in fact you leaving , in a sense makes europe safer ( as would e.g. 
  sweden ) . 
  so who knows what will happen . 
  but it would be extremely easy to adopt a populist scaremongering against such deals with the uk , due to its own current social structure . 
  i ( partially ) explained why . 
  but you just ignored and replied with a canned answer . 
  part of the answer is , a very large part of the population is n't represented . 
  since it 's only governments negotiating and the opposition of each country is left out . 
  this also leads to many side effects that i mentioned . 
  there are also issues of transparency . 
  etc etc. 
  but i am not going to repeat the whole thing . 
  you can just read it . 
  this is an old discussion and the reason why on of the most important parts of the lisbon treaty came to be , the rebalancing of powers between council and parliament . 
  one of the problems of the council is it 's lack of representation of the people . 
  of course they were elected . 
  but domestically you have more than a government , you have a parliament where opposition is represented . 
  so you run the risk ( often visible ) the national governments wo n't be acting on europe 's interest , not even on their nation 's interest but in the interest of their own party aiming to be reelected . 
  and that includes in the interest of local lobbies . 
  it 's not accidental that much of the steps forward are pushed by the commission and parliament and blocked by the council . 
  another aspect has to do with lack of transparency ( you do n't have public debates as in the parliament ) , and more capacity for bullying ( the eurogroup showed how these models do n't work ) . 
   we are thinking about a new european treaty and to give the main power in the eu to the european council , not the commission , '' he told reporters . 
  this is the only thing you need to read . 
  everything else are excuses to attain this purpose . 
  they basically want to backtrack on the lisbon treaty , and make the eu less democratic . 
  an eu where the influence of an elected european parliament is less relevant , and instead what matters are the political games of each national government , in meetings behind closed doors and without any interference from opposition parties . 
  no thank you . 
  the eu is dysfunctional enough as is . 
  if anything i want the commission and parliament to have more powers not less . 
  and the informal aberration that is the eurogroup disbanded asap . 
  yes portugal , is going to drop portuguese . 
  a language in the top 7 ( by both native and total number of speakers ) . 
  the 3rd largest of all european languages . 
  a language that is expanding ( at a rather good pace ) even in terms of native speakers . 
  an official language in countries in europe , america , africa , and asia . 
  a language that culturally binds all these countries , who consider themselves close family . 
  the heart of the [ cplp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_of_portuguese_language_countries ) organisation , whose competence and influence has been growing . 
  yeah , that 's going to happen ... / s, 
  the problem in france is not one of border protection . 
  it 's one of national immigration and integration policies . 
  particularly concerning people coming from their ex colonies . 
  in fact , very similar to the problem uk has . 
  i did n't say you ca n't complain . 
  i said your complaints are contradictory . 
  you can not complain about lack of democracy ** while at the same time ** being against every development intended bring more democracy to the eu . 
  i find your reasoning amusing . 
  * `` my people is completely ignorant of eu politics , therefore the eu is undemocratic '' * what a load of bullshit . 
  also the hypocrisy to see those on the leave side raising the issue of lack of democracy in the eu , when eurosceptics are precisely the ones who always fought against a more democratic eu . 
  a more democratic eu involves precisely steps towards federalisation . 
  and eurosceptics abhor that idea . 
  that 's why they were against the lisbon treaty . 
  in particular that 's why they were against the rebalancing of powers between council and parliament . 
  that 's why britain was so against junker as president , chosen by the parliament , as result of eu parliamentary elections , that involved debates with the `` presidential candidates '' . 
  i do n't mind people being against a closer union . 
  but quit the idiocy of complaining about a democratic eu you never wanted in the first place . 
  really ? 
  what happened in your country following the banking union , or introduction of plans for energy union , or roaming fee cuts , or now the recent deal on new frontex powers ? 
  here is what happened ... nothing . 
  here is what your country card about . 
  the refugee crisis . 
  and that is my point . 
  if you ask people , sure with euroscepticism in the air they may share they do n't want more integration . 
  truth is they do n't care , not enough to complain about it . 
  because those are just abstractions in their mind ... energy union ... who cares . 
  but they care about refugees . 
  so the way you diminish euroscepticism is becoming more resistant to concrete crisis . 
  and personally i believe the way to do it is further integration and more unity . 
  and in practice people really care enough to stop these integration measures, 
    also the idea that euroscepticism is the result of integration is completely bogus . 
  euroscepticism rose with terrorism and the refugee crisis . 
  not with the banking union , or energy union , or cuts on roaming fees . 
   and the euro crisis , the bailouts of greece/italy/spain , high unemployment in southern europe , the lack of foreign policy cohesion in ukraine/syria/libya . 
  the eu has faced a number of problems , and faced them poorly . 
  of course you ca n't ignore this phenomenon . 
  but it seems we agree . 
  most euroscepticism is caused by lack of unified and coordinated response to problems . 
  in that sense diminishing euroscepticism requires further integration . 
  it 's not integration that makes people recent the eu . 
  integration itself to the average citizen is just some abstract term . 
  people get angry when bad things happen . 
  like you said , the crisis in greece , poor response in ukraine , etc, 
  true , it 's been growing , but still a minority . 
  my point as i said in another comment , is that eurosceptic movements are n't just against an ever closer union . 
  they are against the union . 
  to not push for more integration to appease them would be a mistake , because they wo n't stop trying to undermine the european project . 
  to not push because of lack of support does n't make sense if there is indeed enough support to enact required changes for more integration . 
  -- also the idea that euroscepticism is the result of integration is completely bogus .

   but ** nobody really wants ** the automatic ever closer union anymore . 
  france , netherlands , austria and finland all face ** significant euro-sceptic sentiments ** . 
  i do n't get how you reduced `` nobody '' based on minority movements . 
  again , it 's really easy to bitch and complain .
