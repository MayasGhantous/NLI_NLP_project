  of course . 
  i even gave the example of cape verde , which was also part of the portuguese empire . 
  my point is , in these cases the choice of the specific status for each language is often historical , social , economical , diplomatic . 
  fact is they did keep english as an official language , and as such it is perfectly sensible for other organisations to connect with them via english . 
  making maltese an official eu language serves no purpose . 
  and that was the mistake . 
  there is a reason why english is also an official language in malta . 
  this is somewhat common , for certain countries to have their own national language , and then a major language also as official . 
  and that 's what they should use in the eu . 
  imagine ( and it 's not that improbable ) that one day cape verde would join the eu . 
  what would make more sense , for them use portuguese or cape verdean creole ? 
  it 's a pretty damning statistic . 
  it 's not the only one in the article though . 
  moroccans make up for 10 % of prison population and 1/4 of the foreigners in prison . 
  it also tells you the increase from last year was 30 % , which while large shows it was already off the charts . 
  so there you have it , numbers of murders for 2014 , 2015 , and overall prison population . 
  three ( or four depending how you count ) damning statistics . 
  is that enough for you to be alarmed or not really ? 
  that is very disingenuous . 
  to put it lightly . 
  firstly the low sample canned answer . 
  i see that a lot and having a background in mathematics really stands out . 
  there are different ways in which low shoes can be a problem . 
  the usual sense is with respect to confidence degrees , when extrapolating characteristics of a population from a sample . 
  that has nothing do with what we 're doing her since the stats are about the whole population of migrants , not a sample of it . 
  there are other , less formal , but still sensible ways how one could argue the numbers not to be meaningful . 
  if it were just one migrant , causing a single murder in a country where the are no other murders . 
  but again this has nothing to do with the case at hand . 
  we are taking about a sizable population . 
  the 1.5 % of spanish population is more than 700k people . 
  and 18 % all murders which are around 300 . 
  if anything this presentation skews perception to make it seem less than it is , since the total of murders includes those by moroccan . 
  rather than thinking 18 / 100 think 18 / 1.5 vs 88 / 98.5 . 
  i am going to ignore the nonsense that is equating murder with tax evasion . 
  what i am going to point out is that if you can find a specific sub community in spain with such bad ratio of murders per capita ( very hard since moroccans already take 18 % of the murders and they 're only 1.5 % ) , the best you can do is point out how this community is at the same level of the worse if the worse spain has . 
  again usual disclaimers apply , lots of moroccan are good people . 
  but has for the community the numbers are what they are . 
  that 's one way to phrase it . 
  another way to phrase it is * because so much trouble is caused by people from the muslim community , leading to them being so much on the news , making them more noticed . 
  * last time i checked , for instance , moroccans in spain are 1.5 % of the population and commit 18 % of the murders . 
  that 's one sure way to get noticed . 
  the state treats everyone equally . 
  religious people are doing practises that are disadvantageous to them in the real world . 
  fasting for weeks is a disadvantage . 
  having to go to church when you could be studying is a disadvantage . 
  not being able to take a train on saturdays is a disadvantage . 
   even though i 'm not the biggest fan of it but most western countries have freedom of religion laws . 
  so you actually have a right practice your religion no it does n't . 
  if my religion says i must rape your wife i still ca n't do it . 
  in a secular country laws and regulations should be blind to anyone 's particular religion . 
  you are free to choose your religious practice , and at the same time if you practise clashes with laws and regulations , too bad , you must adapt . 
  the state does n't need to go out of its way to make sure your religious needs are taken care of . 
  it just needs to define laws and regulations from a secular point if view . 
  sweden and microaggression are . 
  it 's portraying swedish hyper pc movement . 
  indeed , that one . 
  ( my point being us ` portuguese mesti\u00e7os ' as you put it , are nowhere near that level of crazy , yet anyway ), 
  that 's not the joke . 
  -- microaggression : a subtle but offensive comment or action directed at a minority or other non dominantgroup that is often unintentional or unconsciously reinforces a stereotype : microaggressions such as `` i do n't see you as black . 
  well there we have to disagree . 
  knowing britain well , we have n't reached that level , nor are even close . 
  firstly i said `` having no qualms '' and you said `` having done no wrong '' . 
  no one will say the latter of any government . 
  as for what i haver have said , i have seen it a number of times , both in real life and reddit . 
  as an example after a few seconds of searching see threads like this one , https://reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/47jyai/vivi_2_anos_no_dubai_ama/ and how dismissive some people are of criticism . 
  like i said that have no qualms about it . 
  and brush everything aside with relativistic claims of `` no society bring perfect '' , `` laws being there just to ` scare people ' but are rarely applied '' , `` criticism being exaggerated '' yadayadayadayada . 
  enjoying it does n't mean it 's not a shithole . 
  i find it quite funny how these days in portugal there are youngsters who demonize everything about salazar ( right wing authoritarian 1932-68 ) , while having no qualms about regimes like those of uae or qatar . 
  hey , it 's just an absolute theocratic monarchy , with terrible human rights record and appalling discriminatory treatment of women , and certain minorities and immigrant communities . 
  firstly , i hope you 're aware `` millions '' is nothing . 
  secondly it 's irrelevant . 
  point is , * many in these countries are much worse off than many of the syrian refugees in camps * we can do much more for much cheaper for people from these countries , both in their own countries , as well if bring them in ( meaning the same money will help more people ) * generally speaking these communities are much less problematic * we have strong historical and diplomatically ties with these other countries . 
  there are some rather rich countries right next to syria last time checked . 
  countries where they speak the same language and where most share similar customs and religion . 
  -- regarding what you said , that has little to do with refugees . 
  that is about illegal immigration . 
  indeed most people want to go to rich countries rather than be in shitty places . 
  if that 's enough of a reason to let them in , i rather us portuguese to take people living in poverty in our ex-colonies . 
  many of which already speak the language , have a cultural bond , integrate well , and do n't cause major security problems . 
  or , even better , we could take much of that money and also help them out in their own countries , and make them a better place . 
   three of the syrian men were directly `` commissioned '' by the so-called islamic state to launch suicide bombings in the city of d\u00fcsseldorf , prosecutors said . 
   after ** travelling back into europe following the refugee route through turkey and greece ** they convinced the fourth suspect to join the plot . 
  other sources are reporting * four * , * isis terror plot in germany : four syrian men arrested for allegedly planning suicide bombings in d\u00fcsseldorf * http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/isis-terror-plot-in-germany-four-syrian-men-arrested-for-allegedly-planning-suicide-bombings-in-a7061356.html,

  `` the president of the eurogroup , jeroen dijsselbloem , has once again declined our invitation to take part in a plenary debate on greece , '' said the president of the european parliament at the opening of the plenary session in strasbourg . 
  although the eurogroup leader is not required to be present in debates in the european parliament , tajani argued that it would be important for dijsselbloem to attend plenary sessions , especially at a time when `` citizens '' are being asked to `` sacrifice '' . 
  meps from the various political groups also criticized mr dijsselbloem 's position and called for his resignation , after the eurogroup leader told the german newspaper `` frankfurter allgemeine zeitung '' that the southern countries spent `` in glasses and women and then asked help '' . 
  last week , parliamentary groups from the european socialist party ( pse ) and the european people 's party ( epp ) officially called for the resignation of the dutch leader of the forum of finance ministers of the euro zone and demanded an apology . 
  also the portuguese government , through the minister of foreign affairs and the prime minister , called for the dismissal of dijsselbloem . 
  marcelo rebelo de sousa said he agreed with the position expressed by ant\u00f3nio costa 's executive .
