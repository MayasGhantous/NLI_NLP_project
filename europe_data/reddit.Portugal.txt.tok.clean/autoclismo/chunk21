  '' * the leader of the parliamentary group of the european people 's party , manfred weber - of csu , angela merkel 's cdu brother party in bavaria - justified wednesday the request for a formal resignation of jeroen dijsselbloem from the eurogroup , saying that '' about what the greek people , the italians , the spaniards and the portuguese have suffered in recent years . '', 
  during the epp congress , held in malta today and tomorrow , weber called it an '' unacceptable behavior that dijsselbloem attack [ these countries ] as if they are not prepared to make any kind of reforms . '', 
  that is why we ask that you resign from the presidency of the eurogroup . '', 
  the ppe tightens the siege to the dutchman . 
  last tuesday , several members of the epp group wrote a letter to the eurogroup president demanding that he resign , signed by meps paulo rangel and esteban gonzalez pons , both vice-presidents of the epp . 
  now the leader of the bench comes to reinforce the request , arguing that it is fundamental to `` stay united '' . 
  a position that motivated reactions and requests for resignation from different quarters of political life . 
  manfred weber also says that it is `` important to underline that he [ jeroen dijsselbloem ] is a socialist and even for the socialists , his statements are unacceptable . '', 
  so he has no choice : `` it 's time to resign . '', 
  weber 's statements stand out not only for being leader of the epp bench , but for being german and close to angela merkel . 
  without the support of the german chancellor and finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , life will be more complicated for dijsselbloem in the eurogroup .

'', 
  the initiative of the charter left the vice president of the epp , the spaniard esteban gonzalez pons , and was signed by all members of the european group of the psd and a large group of members of several delegations . 
  the portuguese paulo rangel is one of the first signatories of the letter , which was sent tuesday to dijsselbloem . 
  at a ceremony held this morning at the european parliament in brussels , the president of the parliamentary group , german csu manfred weber , was keen to record the time of signature . 
  `` there can be no contemplations '' , says rangel in malta , where he is to take part in the epp congress , paulo rangel stated that `` this joint position has a relevance policy which can only result in a formal apology and request the resignation of the president of the eurogroup . 
  given the severity of the offensive and discriminatory nature claims , there can be no contemplations . '', 
  `` after the publication of his statements , [ dijsselbloem ] had a chance to rectify before the european parliament , but did n't '' , reads the letter . 
  `` on the contrary , instead of apologizing , said the problem was we do n't have perceived the direct style of speech known as calvinist culture . 
  in our opinion , the calvinist culture has nothing to do with the contempt for other people '' . 
  further , the letter adds that the declarations of dijssoelbloem `` attack one of the most important values that underpin our european union : equality ( ... ) respect these values should be the first duty of any european leader '' . 
  the group joins the group of european socialists to resign and apologize to the president of the eurogroup . 
  last week , faced with charges that arose from several quarters , dijsselbloem refused to resign . 
   ** if ** the quality of portuguese production in whatever specific case ( ! ), 
  is exactly equal to the german alternative ( but probaly cheaper ) , than you are correct ( in that case ) . 
  or if it 's better  who knows ? 
  i mean , it seems pointless to speculate about that which we have no evidence about . 
  that would mean we can make up all sorts of hypothesis . 
  i certainly have never heard about `` made in germany '' brands losing quality due to manufacturing in portugal or other countries . 
  and a fortiori nor have i heard about the label losing power because of that . 
  what we do know is that ( as you yourself said ) , is that it could/should be more transparent . 
  and we know brands seem to like this arrangement ( otherwise they would n't use it ) . 
  we know germany is fiercely against proposals to change the labeling rules to be more transparent . 
  and that portugal and other countries are for said proposals . 
   you could just as well argue that branding largely portuguese-made products as `` made in germany '' dilutes the value of the label and acts as a `` subsidy '' of ( current ) portuguese production by ( past ) german production . 
  that could be the case if there was wide public awareness that `` made in germany '' could mean made in portugal . 
  but there is n't . 
   i suspect both effects are present but which is - on balance - more important is hard to say without detailed statistics . 
  your governments would disagree , as would ours . 
  as shown by what have been their respective positions towards proposals to change the current rules . 
   look , i agree with your demand but the outcome wo n't necessarily benefit portuguese workers or companies and might well have the oppisit effect . 
  that has been said before , and i 've answered it . 
  see here , and the two comments that follow https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61l5kx/comment/dfglp6x, 
  that 's an obvious comment , that misses the point , and adds nothing to the conversation . 
  yes it 's legal . 
  it 's also bullshit . 
  and for that reason it 's been contentious for years and there 's proposals to change it . 
  fair enough . 
  i do agree with that much . 
  there is indeed profit to be made by the company by using the made in germany label . 
  and in principle the success of a company that manufactures in portugal is good for portugal . 
  however , that success is being `` subsidized '' by portugal , in that the `` made in germany '' label is benefiting from portuguese manufacturing that should be contributing to the `` made in portugal '' brand . 
  and a stronger `` made in portugal '' brand should also result in more and better jobs for the country . 
  in this sense , it does n't make sense to ask just leica workers their opinion , because it transcends the company . 
  that is the wrong question . 
  the issue is n't so much that there should be a minimum to qualify for a `` made in '' tag . 
  the main issues are , * there should be a minimum % over which a country is guaranteed a `` made in '' label . 
  so portugal doing almost 100 % of the manufacturing should guarantee a `` made in '' label . 
  * the `` made in '' labels should be prioritized to reflect % of manufacturing . 
  so portugal doing more manufacturing than germany should mean a `` made in portugal '' label should be prioritized ( so you should n't be allowed to have a made in germany label without one from portugal , and the listing should reflect that priority e.g. 
  you ca n't put the german one first ) . 
  that 's speculation is based on the unfounded assumption that , should they have to use `` made in portugal '' , they 'd rather leave portugal . 
  but you do n't know that to be true . 
  in fact the article i posted refers that , unlike cameras ( that are put in a chip in germany ) , the brand 's binoculars are fully made in portugal and have a made in portugal label . 
  this suggests that , were they to lose the made in germany label , it would still pay off to keep manufacturing in portugal . 
  were that not true they 'd be manufacturing the binoculars in germany . 
  no i did n't . 
  and you 'd know it if you bothered to read and think . 
  citing myself from a previous comment ,  what they did was legal , so that 's a short conversation . 
  no one is questioning that what they did is legal . 
  neither me nor the article . 
  do n't like the source , there are many others , e.g. 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/european-plan-made-in-label-source-country no news sources are good enough for you , get it straight from the horse 's mouth . 
  you just managed to make a claim that is both , irrelevant and completely made up . 
  this is getting more and more absurd , i explained myself well , so i 'm done . 
  here is an article explaining what i just did . 
  there are many more out there . 
  https://www.google.pt/amp/www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-does-the-made-in-label-mean-anymore/amp cheers, 
  this just got too stupid . 
  at this point i do n't even buy that you believe your own argument to be sensible , so it 's just a waste of time . 
  me neither . 
  what they did was legal , so that 's a short conversation . 
  what i am saying is , the `` made in labels '' exist for a motive . 
  to tell people where the product is `` made '' . 
  and the semantics of `` made '' here are very clear and have nothing to do with design and innovation . 
  it does n't matter that the company is german much like it does n't matter that nike is american . 
  all of that is irrelevant to the conversation . 
  so according to that principle , if the label `` made in '' does n't faithfully portray where the product was made , it 's bullshit . 
  you 're deceiving people . 
  you may point out lots of justifications as to why one may choose to deceive people and write something that is bullshit . 
  but it 's still deceiving and bullshit . 
  or put another way , here is a nike label , https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5296/5526055145_fe474dae19_z.jpg made in vietnam . 
  now i 'm pretty sure they did n't do any of the design or development of the product . 
  that 's irrelevant though . 
  that 's not what the `` made in '' tag refers to .
