  my point is , if the `` made in label '' was justified by `` design and innovations '' as you put it , then they would n't be required to install a chip in germany to claim that tag . 
  they need to `` make '' something in germany to legally claim the tag , because that 's what the `` made in '' tag refers to . 
  that 's irrelevant to the point . 
  as shown by the fact they they need to actually place a chip in germany to claim the `` made in germany '' . 
  there 's a lot of bullshit involved though . 
  for example , leica cameras made in portugal , have a chip put in in germany to be given the `` made in germany '' tag . 
  http://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/visao1000/culto-leica-nasce-em-portugal=f662184 this is so precisely because `` made in germany '' sells , and can be charged premium . 
  the obvious problem is that their reputation feeds off other countries ' technical proficiency , while the latter remains undervalued . 
   the department of defense uses 4,600,000,000 us gallons ( 1.7 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 10 ) l ) of fuel annually , an average of 12,600,000 us gallons ( 48,000,000 l ) of fuel per day . 
  a large army division may use about 6,000 us gallons ( 23,000 l ) per day . 
  according to the 2005 cia world factbook , if it were a country , the dod would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use , coming in just behind iraq and just ahead of sweden https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_usage_of_the_united_states_military in the event of a major conflict the need for fuel would increase dramatically . 
   do n't need their oil for too long anymore anyways oil is of major importance for the military . 
  war machines feed on oil , not electricity . 
  so do n't expect access to oil to become irrelevant any time soon . 
  do n't get me wrong , less dependence on oil for civilian purposes is still very significant in geo strategical terms . 
  but you ca n't forget about military capabilities . 
  by weakening the states that fight them . 
  these actions have vast social , political and economical implications . 
  on the social end they create unrest , and division , and strengthen ability to recruit . 
  on the political end fringe populist parties , that weaken europe , rise . 
  on the economical end they weaken tourism , force expensive security measures to be enacted , hurt freedom of movement of goods , people and services . 
  you only have to look at where europe is right now , and where it is going , to understand it terrorism is having a significant effect . 
  you 're right it was probably after those stats . 
  but you could have grabbed more up to date stats from the un page i posted elsewhere . 
  this http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml also note the numbers i mention above refer only to un missions , not eu . 
  even more to central african republic ( mali 68 , car 160 ), 
  those numbers are wrong . 
  http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml ** portugal ** police : 2 military experts : 14 troops : 227 total : 243 so it 's either 227 or 243 depending on what you 're counting . 
  these are our actual numbers . 
  http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml ** portugal ** police : 2 military experts : 14 troops : 227 total : 243 so it 's either 227 or 243 depending on what you 're counting . 
  thanks , that was dumb, 
  here are the correct numbers for portugal . 
  http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml ** portugal ** police : 2 military experts : 14 troops : 227 total : 243, 
  you do n't have to think because it says there . 
  and it links to the mission page on the portuguese gov site , which links to the un official mission page . 
  anyway , you can check the official participation numbers for un peacekeeping missions here , in the official un website : http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml ** portugal ** police : 2 military experts : 14 troops : 227 total : 243 so it 's either 227 or 243 depending on what you 're counting . 
   portuguese soldiers operating in mali are doing so in the framework of an eu military mission . 
  as you can see in the map , we have both , 10 in eutm mali ( training mission , eu ) and 68 on minusma ( peacekeeping , un ) . 
   those deployed to the car are carrying out a training - not peacekeeping - mission . 
  same thing , there 's two missions , we have both , 10 in eutm rca ( training , eu ) and 160 in minusca ( peacekeeping , un ) . 
  the 160 are commandos . 
  they were under fire just a few days ago . 
  it was all over the news . 
  they were ~ ~ louded ~ ~ lauded for their effectiveness . 
  http://www.jn.pt/nacional/interior/comandos-abrem-fogo-e-travam-rebeldes-armados-em-missao-da-onu-5706448.html http://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/comandos-louvados-pelo-chefe-da-forca-da-onu-na-republica-centro-africana-5706613.html  if you do n't trust op 's numbers it 's not `` trust '' , the numbers are wrong . 
  that source i provided before is our government 's official website for these missions . 
  and anyone who watches portuguese news should know at least about our commandos in car . 
  the numbers for portugal are wrong . 
  as i noted below , we have , for instance , 160 men in central african republic , 68 in mali and 2 in afghanistan ( all in un missions ) . 
  so , at least 230 , which is a bit more than 4 . 
  source : http://www.emgfa.pt/pt/operacoes/mapa, 
  that number is wrong . 
  here is the map for our missions abroad , http://www.emgfa.pt/pt/operacoes/mapa 160 + 68 in central african republic and mali , alone . 
   and since the 19th century , it 's not like the alliance was of much relevance that 's just wrong . 
  it was explicitly invoked by the british in 1943 to request the use of military facilities on the azores during ww2 . 
  and again in 1982 during the falklands conflict . 
  we call the caretos in portugal ( north ) . 
  [ picture ] ( http://www.dourovalley.eu/multimedia/75/77/montesinho_caretos_1024x768.jpg ) [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/careto ), 
  indeed i have . 
  but maybe i could have expressed myself better . 
  that seems mostly superficial and cosmetic when you read about the root causes . 
  from the article . 
   kosovo now has over 800 mosques , 240 of them built since the war and blamed for helping indoctrinate a new generation in wahhabism . 
  they are part of what moderate imams and officials here describe as a deliberate , long-term strategy by saudi arabia to reshape islam in its image , not only in kosovo but around the world . 
  and its societal effects ,  all around kosovo , families are grappling with the aftermath of years of proselytizing by saudi-trained preachers . 
  some daughters refuse to shake hands with or talk to male relatives . 
  some sons have gone off to jihad . 
  religious vigilantes have threatened -- or committed -- violence against academics , journalists and politicians . 
  so arresting some of the radicals that stand out , does n't seem to me like doing much , when what is at stake is a continuous and long term saudi investment to reshape the society of kosovo . 
  you 'd need much more . 
  trying to cut the root , or at least weaken it , by blocking saudis from doing so . 
  trying to educate the population , be it in schools , via media etc. 
  if not , as this new culture spreads and grows and new generations take power , the game will be over . 
  you will have a new transformed kosovo . 
  well , not everything is improving . 
  how do people feel about this ? 
  * how kosovo was turned into fertile ground for isis * http://nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/europe/how-the-saudis-turned-kosovo-into-fertile-ground-for-isis.html is it being ignored ? 
  or is serious action being demanded/enacted ? 
   well one can debate though what consists of an unfair system . 
  my point was merely that it does n't necessarily follow from the `` oath to protect germany '' that you should n't have eurobonds . 
  and i just mentioned morality amongst the arguments because even such a subjective notion * could * be enough . 
  what you mention about having to protect germany is just a triviality . 
  of course they have to . 
  all governments do that . 
   resentment breeds from both sides . 
  if southern europe states constantly demand more money from the north than that breeds resentment too . 
  you 're taking as if there 's no * truth * and all is relative and only feelings matter . 
  just because both sides might resent it does n't mean one side is n't wrong about it . 
  the british apparently resent the eu . 
  are they right to resent it , or are they victims of uninformed discourse and populism ? 
  the matter of the merits of a fiscal union and eurobonds need to be addressed from a technical standpoint , and there seems to be a relative consensus that without it the system will remain disfuncional . 
   if germany for a long time reduced wage growth specifically to become more competitive once you 're in a single market everything changes . 
  wage cuts have much more serious implications , for instance , with regards to brain drain . 
  and that has an impact in productivity . 
   and your normal german sacrificed for that and now they get critized when other european countries simply did not make these harsh reforms and are now just complaining when they are told they should do that . 
  i wasnt to go there , but if you 're going to turn this into an historical and moralising discourse , i 'm pretty sure germany has benefited from the help of others to get back on its feet , at a time most would say it did n't deserve . 
  on another note , it 's also important to consider each countries historical peculiarities . 
  remember portugal was a dictatorship until 1975 , and that the period that followed was one of great turmoil ( communists wanting to take over ) . 
  and the country was pretty much bankrupt after the independence war with the colonies , and subsequently losing them and all the investments in the regions . 
  and that due to these wars and the civil wars that followed there , portugal then a country of 7m-8m took about 600k `` retornados '' ( basically refugees ) .
