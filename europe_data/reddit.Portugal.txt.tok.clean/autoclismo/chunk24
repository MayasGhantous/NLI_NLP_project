  sure greece and portugal can affect germany . 
  in fact that 's my point , that on the limit these countries may matter a lot . 
  but that will to a great extent depend on the policies of the union . 
  and these are shaped by those more influential . 
  you might if shit happens . 
  there , a smiley for you to , 
   well the german chancellors job is to do what is best for germany see your discourse , as schauble 's , is much closer to the typical trump discourse . 
  it 's egotistical . 
  assumes all you have to do is care about yourself and not in any way about what 's `` the right thing to do '' . 
  and does n't consider that acting in that manner may actually turn out to be counter productive . 
   germany has already taken hits for other ez countries no it has n't . 
  it does n't make sense to talk about taking hits when the whole system is slanted to favour you . 
  germany is favoured by an euro design that provides it with an unfair advantage over smaller economies . 
  germany is favoured by a political dominance that dictates a biased application of rules in its favour . 
  germany was favoured in the whole greek debt debacle with deals dictating that `` bailout '' loans to greece would effectively bail out much of the german financial system instead rather than greece . 
  leveling the plane field a bit is not getting germany to take a hit . 
  -- as an important side note , it would be educational to spend some time abroad to get a perception of some other countries ' views of schauble . 
  his `` germany first '' attitude , arrogance and politically incorrectness in the worst sense , is pervasive throughout his discourse . 
  an instant classic was a somewhat recent interview where he was asked about deutsch bank , and his answer was that he was n't worried about it but rather he was worried about portugal . 
  a minister of finances of a nation , commenting on another nations internal affairs ( as he constantly does as if he were a minister of europe ) , attacking it , to deviate attention from internal affairs . 
  you may not be aware how despised he is in countries like portugal . 
  from the left to the right . 
  from politicians to commentators . 
  pretty much everyone despises him . 
  here is , for instance , a vote to repudiate public comments by schauble on portugal ( and not the comments mentioned above , but another instance ) . 
  the motion was approved by all parties in the parliament . 
  it 's important to be somewhat aware of how much hatred this man generates . 
  and i do n't think most germans do . 
   it is one completely out of touch though . 
  one that the vast majority of people will not agree with him on . 
  out of touch with what ? 
  public opinion perhaps . 
  but in line with what many if not most economists would argue to be a much more sensible implementation of the eurozone . 
  in other words , the complete opposite of trump . 
  not populist , not popular , but sensible from a technical standpoint . 
   eurobonds are simply actively bad for germany . 
  i answered that . 
  you just ignored it and repeated yourself . 
  but hey , if the eurozone desintegrates , leading possibly to the end or a huge fracture of the eu , i guess that will be just fine ... / s, 
   schulz has been advocating things like eurobonds that would be actively bad for germany . 
  funny how this goes completely against the `` like trump '' native . 
  it 's the complete opposite of a populist and egotistical position . 
  as for such a suggestion , a strong union require countries to often choose common good over selfish goals . 
  eurobonds may be `` bad '' for germany in that they will have to share the burden . 
  but a stronger union is good for everybody including germany . 
  that the current system hurts the smaller economies and favours powerhouses like germany seems to be well established . 
  the current status quo was predicted and unsurprising . 
  it 's interesting how finland for instance , maintained a discourse of moral superiority towards weaker economies , until its own economy suffered . 
  all of the sudden quitting the euro became a topic of debate . 
  https://www.google.pt/amp/uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idukkcn0wc1tm given the current state of affairs it should be rather obvious that continuing to grow inequality in societies , and frustration amongst the weaker is a path towards disaster . 
  so it may be a bit shortsighted to act selfishly .

  according to rabat , the agreement signed with the european union ( eu ) must include `` the sara or her part '' . 
  the incident is a result of interpretations of the territorial scope of the partnership that emerged with the judgment of 21 december 2016 of the european court of justice , which requires that `` the region of the sahara should be explicitly mentioned to be covered in the agreement on agriculture . 
  and it is not said that the fact that the status of the territory , such an agreement can not be signed '' , not calling into question the legal validity or political legitimacy of an agricultural agreement that includes the sahara . 
  for morocco the sara is just another region of the kingdom , and any agreement automatically covers this region . 
  to the european court of justice , the status of the sahara is distinctive and can not be automatically covered in the moroccan national character . 
  in this way the european union avoids taking a clear position on the question of western sahara , because it is a dispute whose resolution is in the hands of the united nations . 
  for morocco , the failure of the partnership agreement , with regard to patent considerations in the judgment of the european court of justice , may result in `` heavy consequences for the socio-economic plan , which the eu must assume full responsibility '' . 
  in order to strengthen the european union pressure , rabat , alleging a possible blockage of the european market to moroccan products , threatens to accelerate the partnerships `` already initiated '' with russia , china , india and japan , as well as with the countries of the gulf .

  that 's part of it . 
  but that documentary goes into other details . 
  going by memory here , e.g. 
  he may have misinterpreted the warmth and to an extent euphoria of the people when we went to mozambique , as a sign of support for the policies of the time , when it was more a sign of hope that we would enact change . 
  as mentioned , they supported different factions . 
  but also , the us was n't consistent with their support during the independence war . 
  firstly because the us has an important air base in the azores , which was rather important at that time ( and portugal threatened to end that deal ) . 
  secondly because eventually it became clear that mpla ( soviet backed ) had the upper hand , so portugal had a better chance of controlling the territory than unita ( us backed ) . 
   people forget but those portuguese colonial wars had a lot of effects . 
  add to that the portuguese colonies becoming the stage of cold war proxy conflicts devastating these countries . 
  countries that , despite all problems , were developing at a rather good pace . 
  the dictatorship in portugal was toning down after the death of salazar . 
  marcelo caetano was much more moderate , and supported a steady transition of powers to the colonies . 
  formally more autonomy . 
  informally , in negotiations , was open towards a path to federalisation and possible independence . 
  in fact they were close to a deal . 
  see e.g. 
  https://youtu.be/mr95rp80t3q https://youtu.be/8yrn7eczmni https://youtu.be/nd9ctsvtqxi https://youtu.be/kxdmuuvjstg i 'm not claiming things would have been better one way or another . 
  and `` what if 's '' in history are useless . 
  but a lot of nuance is lacking in your comment . 
  precisely same answer to your remark that not all islamist terrorism is wahhabi . 
   but ** wahhabi ** terrorism is . 
   the other terrorisms are called by their own name . 
  also could answer  no thanks . 
  i 'll just use ** terrorism ** . 
   potato potato , they 're ** terrorism ** , regardless of ** islamist ** . 
  we can always use a more specific names or more generic ones . 
  you 're not making any argument really . 
  i could just throw all your answers back at you . 
  and not all terrorism is islamist terrorism . 
  so what ? 
  use wahhabi terrorism if it is associated with wahhabism , and another thing when it is not . 
  all daesh related terrorism is wahhabi . 
  hezbollah would be shi'a . 
  and if you misstag some ... great . 
  you just made them wahhabi whether they want it or not . 
  i do think it 's a mistake to talk about islamist/islamic terrorism . 
  all this time we should be calling it something more specific , for instance wahhabi terrorism . 
  focusing on a specific sect and dissociating this form of terrorism from islam in general , would make it less likely for non wahhabi muslims to identify with it , and be seduced by it .
