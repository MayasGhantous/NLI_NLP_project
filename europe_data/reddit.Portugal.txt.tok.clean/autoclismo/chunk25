  likewise , whenever laws directed at more fundamentalist forms of islam are enacted , people would be less likely to think of them as anti-muslim . 
  at most they 'd be anti-wahhabi . 
  indeed . 
  to be fair and objective , it is definitely an improvement over saudi arabia . 
  but still rather problematic , and the fact is morocco is a source of terrorism . 
  i guess the choice is influenced by your institutional relations . 
  in portugal if i recall correctly , bangladeshi are mostly in control , with some support of our state . 
  ideally we should all be asking help to , e.g. 
  imams from albania . 
  but i can also see sole possible complications since if the local muslim communities do n't identify at all with these imams try will just look elsewhere . 
  in france you have lots of northern africans . 
  in portugal muslims are fewbut a decent proportion is from india/bangladesh ... 
  yes i know you are . 
  but given the context that 's irrelevant . 
  i could answer and start a discussion on that topic , but is just a digression on what really matters here . 
  whether we have the moral upper hand or play the same game is one discussion we could have . 
  the point here though , is not a meta discussion on the rules of the game , but on the dangers of losing it . 
  i honestly do n't get these answers . 
  * `` in a football game what is the difference between the other team scoring and your team scoring ? 
  '' * * `` in a war what is the difference between the other guys shooting ours and we shooting the other guys '' * even if you 're right ( and i am not saying you are ) , your sole point is that we are playing using the same tactics . 
  that in no way shape or form says we should be less concerned .

  the decision was taken in the case of the moroccan citizen mostafa lounani , who was arrested in belgium for help in forging documents for a terrorist network that sent jihadists to iraq . 
  after his sentence , lounani had requested refugee status for fear of persecution if he was repatriated back to morocco . 
  the court has now stated that even if a terrorist act is not committed , asylum may be denied if the applicant helps to recruit , organize or equip jihadists . 
  thus , and for the court , lounani provided logistical support to a terrorist group with an international dimension , which justifies its exclusion from refugee status .

  honestly i can not understand anything you 're saying . 
  i just give up . 
    dividing the country in regions  indeed it is , but for national issues ( e.g. 
  the economy ) there is very little need for `` local '' representation because you all share the same country . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i 'm talking about national parliamentary elections . 
  look at the uk , the number of seats is not proportional to the number of votes each party gets . 
   why on the eu you have parliament and council  only one of which you are allowed to elect . 
  you have made up your own definition of `` elect '' . 
  even if you mean `` elect directly '' it 's still not true , because in some countries you vote directly on mep 's and in others you vote on lists . 
  in each eu country we do elect both our mep 's and our members of the council . 
  the members of the council are democratically elected , it 's just not a direct election . 
  but neither my prime minister not yours are elected via direct elections and we appear to be fine with that . 
  in portugal we only have a directly elected president , and in the uk there 's not even that . 
   within a nation these are fine because the demos elect the electors . 
  i 'm honestly not getting what you are saying . 
  it 's common for ( national ) parliaments to be elected by dividing the country in regions , and having electors voting on mp 's for their own region . 
  and typically each regions ' weight is not directly proportional to their inhabitants . 
  then if you think of federations then this disproportionally is ( and should be ) even bigger . 
  because you have to balance between representation of the people and of each state ( states having a fair amount of independence ) . 
  this is why on the us you have house and senate . 
  and why on the eu you have parliament and council . 
   that means that the people of portugal have 21/751 and 1/30 a voice . 
  that 's simply not acceptable . 
  on the contrary . 
  that 's how it typically works . 
   the only people we ( the demos ) get to elect are meps . 
  that is intolerable for a supra-national democracy . 
  this is just wrong . 
  * the european parliament consists of meps voted in the european parliament elections . 
  * the european council consists of the leaders of each country , democratically elected in each member country . 
  * the european commission president is proposed by the european council ( democratically elected ) , with a qualified majority vote . 
  and then voted in by the european parliament ( which is also democratically elected ) . 
  [ so not too different from how governments are indirectly elected ] * the council of the european union are also sets of ministers of each countries government ( each also democratically elected ), 
  regulate those exercising a profession and dictate the teaching of a particular religion are different things . 
  and even if you believe regulating does break such laws , well laws can be changed . 
  there 's an enormous amount of regulations that go into many activities , particularly those concerning education . 
  it is only sensible to regulate an activity where people are deeply indoctrinated . 
  for a number of reasons , from security , to protecting people from being taken advantage of . 
   in 2015 , france signed a deal with morocco to help educate future french and francophone imams . 
  the goal is to reinforce and promote a more balanced form of islam that conforms to france 's republican ideals . 
  but the deal ** also aims to play down efforts by saudi arabia and qatar to promote ultraconservative and fundamentalist ** strands of the religion . 
  hard to understand why imams from these ultraconservative countries are not banned from teaching/funding religion though . 
  also , stricter regulations could well be applied . 
  demanding imams to complete courses on ethics and other relevant subjects in order to exercise their profession .

  i still fail to see what your point was . 
  it was not in agreement nor disagreement with what i said . 
  just a completely orthogonal observation . 
  ok indeed i misunderstood . 
  i somewhat agree with that assertion . 
  to an extent . 
  that 's not disagreeing with my point in any way though . 
  i guess maybe you were n't disagreeing and i misinterpreted it as such . 
  sure but their relationship with syria is also somewhat complicated . 
  indeed hamas is a muslim brotherhood offshoot supported by bashar al-assad . 
  so palestinians ate somewhat divided over syria . 
  this article explores the intricacies . 
  https://intpolicydigest.org/2014/04/03/syria-s-civil-war-assad-palestinians/  assad 's palestinian backers have generally framed their narratives of the syrian crisis around a western-backed conspiracy to overthrow the only arab regime that remains willing to confront israel . 
  the palestinian supporters of the rebellion , however , view assad as a dictator responsible for killing his own people . 
  rebel supporters are quick to bring up the massacre of palestinian refugees at the lebanese camp of tel al-zaatar in 1976 , for which hafez al-assad 's forces bore responsibility . 
  either way , as we seem to agree on this , it 's far from being a regional and contained conflict . 
  and this makes me very pessimistic towards the possibility of an effective peace deal . 
  the usual argument is precisely that , because it 's such a geostrategic mess , solving the palestinian crisis would be a huge step towards piece in the middle east . 
  personally i 'm more inclined to see it as a symptom . 
  and i do n't think focusing on palestine itself is going to solve the palestinian crisis . 
  no , i answered it . 
  it 's here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pya2d/_/dcw7qe6 your point about divisions of territory in no way shape or form contradict what i said . 
  if anything support it . 
  how do you go from there to attainable peace via a peace deal ? 
  there is nothing justifying your point of view that peace would be attained . 
  as i said elsewhere the relation of hamas with iran is mostly one of convenience and as such had suffered ups and downs . 
  in fact until recently their relationship were severed ( a break that lasted quite a few years ) .
