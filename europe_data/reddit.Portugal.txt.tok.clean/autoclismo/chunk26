  it 's not accidental that their base is in qatar . 
  and of course they are not backed by egypt despite being sunni . 
  egypt itself tries to resist the influence of saudi and friends , and as recent history shows , it is still quite affected by it . 
  anyway , my point is not that it 's simple . 
  quite the contrary . 
  any analysis we do here is an oversimplification and i began by pointing that out . 
  my point is precisely that the chessboard is quite complex . 
  and that the israeli - palestinian dispute is not a contained regional conflict . 
  therefore it is naive in my opinion to believe that israel , by compromising and giving away power in exchange for a peace deal , would attain actual piece . 
  but you made no point . 
  you just said it . 
  you did n't justify it in any way . 
  you did n't argue . 
  you did n't present any reasoning . 
  i made a point . 
  agree or disagree , i did present arguments , and reasoned about them . 
  and i 'm saying i find that unlikely . 
  that was my point from the beginning . 
  it is n't a contained regional conflict . 
  a signature is meaningless . 
  that was the point since my initial comment . 
  and one that i 've since justified in every response . 
  you gave me nothing back as to why that perspective is wrong . 
  as i noted , if anything your comments appeared to agree with my arguments . 
  and your perspective that peace would be attained appears to me as not justified anywhere in the conversation . 
  iran - hamas relations are of convenience and therefore complicated and with their ups and downs . 
  regardless if anything that stresses my point , that the palestinians and hamas are part of a complicated chess match and would continue to be used as such . 
   except there was a time when peace was in reach . 
  there we a time when a ** peace deal ** was in reach . 
  my point was not that a deal ca n't be made , but that it seems unlikely to me that it would result in peace . 
  but i do agree with that . 
  the divisions are rather problematic . 
  i do n't see how that contradicts my initial point though . 
  if anything you appear to be agreeing . 
  as i said , their identity ( generalising ) revolves primarily or at least to a great extent around their religion/sect . 
  so this is not a mere israel / palestine problem . 
  palestinians are part of the middle eastern sunni world , as is hamas . 
  so the idea that you can appease them and attain peace , with a compromise , giving away power and strength their position , seems naive . 
  hamas is not going to disband and say `` that 's it we 're happy '' , down from their hq in qatar . 
  saudi arabia is not going to stop exerting their influence on the palestinians . 
  and excuses to attain israel will always exist . 
   hamas is under sphere influence of middle eastern shia ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamas ideology : sunni islamism religion : sunni islam headquarters : gaza , palestinian territories doha , qatar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_palestine  palestinian muslims primarily practice shafi'i islam , which is a branch of sunni islam . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_qatar sunnis account for the majority of qatar 's muslim population at upwards of 90 % . 
  most sunnis adhere to the salafi interpretation of islam . 
   you are mischaracterising both the situation and my arguement . 
  i 'm not blaming `` the west '' out of some bias , but pointing out what actually happened . 
  and i 'm relativizing the importance of what you point out . 
  like i said , i could point out what happened in lusophone africa , or point out what happened in east timor . 
  and we could contrast it with the francophone northern africa , or see the irony in having terrorism in indonesia , not east timor . 
   you decide that it was n't their fault at all , and everything that is wrong with the world is just islam , islam , islam . 
  i was much more specific than `` islam '' . 
  in fact what i referred to poses a problem in the islamic world itself . 
  with many islamic nations trying to shield themselves against it . 
  egypt would be an example . 
  but it 's far reaching . 
  we could point out morocco . 
  * reports : morocco bans sale of full-face veil * http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/reports-morocco-bans-production-sale-burqa-170110140716164.html or kyrgyzstan , * kyrgyzstan president : ` women in mini skirts do n't become suicide bombers ' * http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36846249 or kosovo , * how kosovo was turned into fertile ground for isis * https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/europe/how-the-saudis-turned-kosovo-into-fertile-ground-for-isis.html nowhere did i make this about muslims against the world . 
  nor did i wrap muslims all in the same box . 
   the geopolitical situation in the middle east is far more complex than you portray here . 
  unless you care to inform yourself and not stick to your bias , then there is no point having a discussion . 
  i could retort the same . 
   because it is not the `` middle eastern sunni world '' that is promoting violence against israel . 
  if it was , then neither egypt not jordan would be on good terms with israel today perhaps i was n't clear . 
  both egypt and jordan themselves suffer from what i was referring to as being part of the muslim sunni middle eastern world , where the saudi 's are the dominant force . 
  fortunately these are examples of countries , that have been affected but resistant enough . 
  and if anything your example shows that such resistance is key to achieve peace and that israel does want peace . 
  as for your historical recap , you can blame us westerns for all the bad in the world , if that 's your bias . 
  if the lusophone african world was full of terrorism , and portugal were in the situation of france , it would be really easy to blame it on oppression , but alas it is n't . 
  east timor suffered an horrendous genocide in the hands of indonesia . 
  terrorism could be easily justified . 
  however it is not in east timor but in indonesia that you will find problems with terrorism . 
  islamic terrorism . 
  speaking of which , [ al-qaeda ordered attacks ] ( https://youtu.be/axhr8aoxxkc ) in retaliation of support for east timor 's independence . 
  because islamic domination of christian countries is a good thing . 
  so that is just empty rhetoric . 
  they are moved by their cause . 
  they will attack anyone who opposes it . 
  you will never appease them . 
   however the country kept the mentality that everyone was out to destroy them . 
  but how is this not partially true ? 
  are the palestinians and hamaz not going to remain part of and under the sphere of influence of the rest of the middle eastern sunni world ? 
  and is the middle eastern sunni world not continue to be a source of extremism and religious/political expansionism ? 
   no one should try to justify this . 
  i suppose you mean this figuratively , anyway it 's not a great attitude to have . 
   this is just as bad as any other nation who occupies territory and then tries to settle people there * disclaimer : * i have more doubts than certainties , and i do not condone the inhumane treatment of palestineans ( or anybody ) . 
  merely classifying it as good or bad lacks pragmatism . 
  if you follow ethics of conviction , indeed that 's all you need . 
  but ethics of conviction are in my view an exercise in egocentrism . 
  it means you just care about feeling good about your own actions , while ignoring the consequences in the real world . 
  if on the other hand , you do prescribe to ethics of responsibility , then everything becomes complicated . 
  ** if ** a realistic deal were possible , that results in peace in that territory , i would be all for it . 
  but quite frankly that seems , in my opinion , naive wishful thinking . 
  this is n't a regional conflict . 
  firstly nowadays `` palestinians '' denotes an ethnonational group . 
  but more importantly , and despite the rise of palestinian `` nationalism '' , the middle eastern / northern african muslims sense of identity revolves primarily around religion . 
  generalising ( and we need to do so to have a discussion ) , the palestinians will continue to be under the the sunni sphere of influence . 
  as will hamaz . 
  and they will continue to be used as pawns in a complex geostrategic chess match . 
  some will argue the israeli-palestinian conflict to be the source of all problems in the muslim world .
