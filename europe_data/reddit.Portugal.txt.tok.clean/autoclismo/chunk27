  in this view the concerns i referred to are minimised , since a deal would pacify the region . 
  again , i consider this to be naive wishful thinking . 
  remember al-qaeda 's position on the [ genocide of the ( christian ) timorese ] ( https://youtu.be/axhr8aoxxkc ) by the indonesian . 
  what have the timorese ever done to them ? 
  this is not a struggle of the oppressed . 
  they do n't empathise with the oppressed . 
  peace deals are optimal if realistic . 
  but i can empathise with the point of view of the israelis , where giving in will only make them weaker , and becoming weaker will only result in more conflict . 
  while the opposite , achieving more dominance , will weaken their enemy and result in more peace . 
  ( again , disclaimer , i do n't want to sound too sure of anything . 
  and any analysis here is bound to be reductionist . ), 
  a lot possibly . 
  many are even reported by their families in france ( as the article states ) . 
  at this point , even if you know well in advance they are going , you ca n't do anything . 
  you just let them go , and then how do you keep track ? 
  but proving that once there , they willingly committed crimes , is a much harder task . 
  firstly note laws are n't retroactive . 
  so such a law , to be put in place , would not apply to those already there . 
  as with any laws , every citizen must comply with them . 
  no one would be arrested * for fighting with the ygp * if that 's not deemed a crime . 
  also fighting for the ygp is n't a problem , then you should be allowed to go , should you request authorisation with that justification and respective proof . 
  if you choose to go without authorisation , then you 'd be guilty of a crime . 
  the penalty does n't necessarily have to be prison ( in all cases ) . 
  and most crimes have mitigating factors , so should you come clean and provide evidence , penalty could be softer . 
  also even in cases where they are arrested , they would n't have to be mixed . 
  i provided a link to a translation as required by the rules . 
  true . 
  but it 's not the same , for the many reasons i listed . 
  in particular , and pasting from another comment : they would be convicted of a crime just for going there . 
  those convicted are easier to control . 
  you could investigate them further while they are arrested for the smaller crime . 
  you could also have them on parole with electronic tagging ( e.g. 
  ankle bracelets ) . 
  this also means that in some cases you could act even before they leave france or at least before they get to syria/iraq ( e.g. 
  arrested by turkish authorities ) . 
  you 'd just have to find they are planning to go to syria/iraq . 
  like i said , there 's no magic solutions . 
  the best you can do is make their lives more difficult and ours easier . 
  it certainly is easier than proving someone went to syria/iraq ** and ** engaged in jiahd . 
  of course the penalties would n't compare . 
  these people would n't be convicted of terrorism . 
  but they would be convicted of a crime . 
  it would n't be all or nothing . 
  those convicted are easier to control . 
  you could investigate them further while they are arrested for the smaller crime . 
  you could also have them on parole with electronic tagging ( e.g. 
  ankle bracelets ) .

  are you serious ? 
  i know it is forbidden to travel in a country ** to engage in jihad ** . 
  what i 'm suggesting is to be make illegal ** to go to syria/iraq ** ( without proper authorisation to be provided by france/eu , depending how it is implemented ) . 
  note how i did n't mention jihad anywhere in what i suggested . 
  it 's a kind of `` reverse visa '' . 
  the whole point being that you would n't need to prove any terrorism association for it to be a crime . 
  as i make painfully clear in my original comment , which you could just read . 
  i though it 'd be fair to assume you read my original comment . 
  what i wrote was :  ** or they should have made it illegal to travel to iraq / syria ( unless granted authorisation to do so ) long ago . 
  ** regarding what this would accomplish , read the paragraphs that follow in my original comment . 
   all of this is happening . 
  it 's already illegal to travel ** to engage in jihad ** . 
  and my point was it should be made illegal to travel . 
  that 's beyond the point . 
  in the paragraphs below that quote i explain how it would be useful . 
  or they should have made it illegal to travel to iraq / syria ( unless granted authorisation to do so ) long ago . 
  this would mean that they would be guilty of a crime that would be relatively easy to prove ( comparatively to terrorism charges anyway ) . 
  while it not a magic solution it would make things simpler . 
  some might have been discouraged to go ( more complicated and more risky to go ) and others would get caught even before getting there . 
  some now could be in jail for some time , others could be wearing electronic bracelets , others might be persuaded to cooperate , etc.

  nothing new . 
  he was a big supporter of sanctions to portugal . 
  in fact , this is why jos\u00e9 in\u00e1cio faria ( mpt ) recently quit alde and joined ... ppe . 
  because he claimed that ppe 's stance was much more moderated than that of alde . 
  verhofstadt was for applying sanctions to portugal ( for supposedly breaking deficit rules ) . 
  this is retarded for a long list of motives . 
  -- * it 's even debatable whether portugal broke the rules . 
  firstly it 's not clear if the effects of the banif ( bank ) resolution should count , bringing the number down to 3.2 % , according to the commission itself ( who used that number as an argument ) . 
  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/07/12-portugal-spain-excessive-deficit/ and then the eurostat disagrees and claims the number ( without banif ) to be 2.8 \u2105 . 
  https://www.google.pt/amp/www.dn.pt/dinheiro/interior/amp/bruxelas-reitera-que-defice-sem-banif-foi-32-do-pib-em-2015-5155268.html * france broke the rules ( 3.5 \u2105 ) and nobody cared because , like junker said , france is france . 
  also this http://www.dn.pt/mundo/interior/hollande-e-o-acordo-secreto-com-a-ue-para-nao-cumprir-o-defice-5476642.html * portugal 's previous government ( right wing , in power until last year , the year sanctions referred to ) was pretty much following troika 's recipe , and closely being monitored ask the way by troika . 
  so even if it had failed responsibility should be shared . 
  * portugal 's prescribed recipe , is the same imf research itself claims to be flawed . 
  * portugal was often used as a good example , of successful implementation of troika 's austere approach , and our then finance minister seen as protege of schaeuble . 
  * portugal 's current government ( left wing ) , ironically , by all measures , was on its way to actually achieve the a < 3 % deficit ( which could have changed had we gotten fined , a goal that was also being hurt by the cloud of uncertainty of potential sanctions ) . 
  to add insult to injury , germany 's trade surplus is above the mandatory limits for 5 years in a row , which hurts the likes of portugal in achieving their deficit limit goals . 
  but the commission finds that ok . and his puppet dijsselbloem is the minister of finance of that which is one of the top tax havens in europe . 
  just too much hypocrisy . 
  verhofstadt is supposedly for a strong union . 
  despite austerity and all sacrifices made , portuguese remain strongly pro eu , and mostly free of anti eu populist waves . 
  imagine how much damage sanctions sanctions would have done . 
  the interview at the end , with the feminist apologist , should at least provide some clarity as to how they got to be where they are now . 
  it 's astounding as even after such a damning report all agree cares about is distracting from the topic at hand , with claims of how sexism is everywhere , and all religions are controlling , yadayadayadayada ... 
  truly pathetic . 
  since it 's an adaptation of the spanish original , it 's not likely to be much better ... 
  i have n't watched either though . 
  apparently so .
