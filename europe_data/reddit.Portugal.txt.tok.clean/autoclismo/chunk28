  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_ministerio_del_tiempo  international adaptations  portugal was the first country to have the series adapted locally , with a version entitled o minist\u00e9rio do tempo produced by iniziomedia . 
  as of december 2016 the format has also been sold to china , with negotiations mentioned for germany , france , italy and us [ # ]  [ # ] `` el ministerio del tiempo abre sede en portugal '' ( el ministerio del tiempo opens headquarters in portugal ) http://www.todotvnews.com/news/el-ministerio-del-tiempo-abre-sede-en-portugal.html, 
  no idea . 
  this one is very recent , so probably not the original , should there be others . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the player ( in the app at least ) has a cc option for subtitled when available . 
  but i checked it before and this series did n't have it . 
  the only one i remember finding with subtitles was `` been vindos a beirais '' . 
   it 's harder for me to learn european portuguese i maintain a list of resources for european portuguese . 
  i 'll paste it below . 
   id watch the shit out of a portuguese game of thrones there are quite a few new portuguese series . 
  one of them is called `` minist\u00e9rio do tempo '' ( ministry of time ) . 
  it involves time traveling , to protect key events in portuguese history . 
  http://www.rtp.pt/play/p3036/ministerio-do-tempo you can find this and other series here . 
  http://www.rtp.pt/play/ondemand/ficcao or if you prefer a better interface , in the rtp play app , under `` inicio -  fic\u00e7\u00e3o '' . 
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.rtp.play  awesome podcasts that are n't very difficult to follow . 
  the best i know is psylogicdrawing . 
  it 's a pop science , psychology channel . 
  the narration is slow enough , and the enunciation is great . 
  plus you have subtitles available . 
  http://www.youtube.com/psylogicdrawing i think * `` sem truques '' * may work too . 
  the interviewer has a nice paused style of speaking . 
  a good amount of her guests are from portuguese ex-colonies though , so you may notice the accent . 
  https://youtu.be/o1xecezwclm another one that surely will be recommend is rui unas ' * maluco beleza * . 
  he can speak rather fast though , and has a very accentuated vowel reduction ( but that 's almost standard in lisbon these days ) . 
  https://youtu.be/r5upluyrmk4 below is the list of european portuguese resources i mentioned . 
  some of it may be useful to you . 
  hope it helps !, 
  -- ** audio courses ** michel thomas uses european portuguese . 
  http://www.michelthomas.com/learn-portuguese.php the focus is spoken language , and i really like their teaching methods . 
  note the very first lesson uses a beep to remind you to pause and answer questions yourself . 
  it is annoying in my opinion , but they stop doing it after the first lesson . 
  -- ** written courses ** * ( note the books below are in portuguese !, 
  if you 're a beginner then this is only good if you have a tutor . 
  if you 're intermediate level books then it should work too . 
  there is a book in english further down below ) * the orthography of portuguese changed recently ( the so called ao90 orthographic agreement ) . 
  so you should make sure written material complies with the new system . 
  this is the section of portuguese for foreigners in wook , a really nice online bookstore in portugal . 
  http://m.wook.pt/home/index?restricts=8066x5839x18010x18163 this one makes it explicit that it follows the new orthographic agreement so it 's a very safe bet . 
  http://wook.pt/ficha?id=11352870 these also follow the orthographic agreement . 
  learning book plus exercises . 
  looks quite nice . 
  http://wook.pt/ficha?id=196038 http://wook.pt/ficha?id=222484 the fnac bookstore in portugal also has quite a few . 
  this collection seems pretty good . 
  they comply with the new orthography . 
  made at the university of lisbon . 
  http://www.fnac.pt/aprender-portugues-1-nivel-a1-a2-manual-do-aluno-varios/a620488 http://www.fnac.pt/aprender-portugues-1-nivel-a1-a2-caderno-de-exercicios-varios/a623474 those are the level 1 learning and exercise books .

  https://pptonline.acm.gov.pt/ in the [ thread ] ( https://reddit.com/r/portuguese/comments/4mhtoj/new_portuguese_learning_platform_from_portuguese/ ) about this app some people did n't like that it asked for phone number , but apparently you can just fill it with zeros .

  -- ** language exchange ** hellotalk has a good reputation .

  http://observador.pt/opiniao/autor/lucy/ the portuguese version always comes first .

  -- ** portuguese tv and radio ** there is rtp play . 
  it includes all the rtp ( public television ) tv channels and radio . 
  both live and on demand . 
  http://www.rtp.pt/play/ there are apps available . 
  http://www.rtp.pt/wportal/sites/tv/mobile/apps.php using the app , some of the content has subtitles in portuguese . 
  one such example would be the series `` bem-vindos a beirais '' .

  -- ** documentaries on youtube ** here is a portuguese documentary about punk rock with subtitles in english https://youtu.be/zk7edn6ywqs here is a channel with quite a few portuguese documentaries , many with subtitles https://youtube.com/user/personanongratapic -- ** educational podcasts ** `` say it in portuguese '' is a podcast about european portuguese expressions . 
  intended for students of the language but fully in portuguese , so not for absolute beginners . 
  http://sayitinportuguese.pt -- ** music ** one way to immerse yourself in the language is listening to music . 
  even if you do n't understand it , you get used to the sounds and pick a word here and there . 
  you can also read the lyrics and once you know the lyrics every time you listen to the song you 're reinforcing those words . 
  ( keeping in mind music lyrics are often poetic and do n't follow the usual rules of grammar ) for portuguese bands check out : / r/somluso there 's also the music discovery sub for music all portuguese speaking countries : / r/musicanova also see these threads with lyric music videos in / r/portuguese .

  not the reverse though . 
  maybe i 've misinterpreted your initial comment . 
  looking back that may have well been the case . 
  if so , sorry for all the pointless discussion . 
   what do you mean `` generic unspecified ` your ' is where the dishonesty lies '' ? 
  it 's in the rest of my comment where you posted that from . 
   i do n't know what point you think you 're making , but i am most certainly not being dishonest . 
  suppose i claimed , `` you need to prove to belong to a sephardic jew tradition to get portuguese citizenship '' this is obviously misleading and dishonest . 
  this is n't true in the general case .
