  although some people have had to do so . 
  there 's a way to acquire nationality that requires this proviso . 
   10 yeas of residency is not a subjective criteria , you either fulfill it or you do n't i said as much myself . 
   you can say that some people with 7 years are more `` national '' than others with 12 years , that 's your subjective opinion . 
  but the legal criteria is clear as water . 
  again , i said so myself . 
  my point was , that that objectivity has limited value in a process that is subjective by nature at all other levels . 
  -- also as a side note , i 'm not trying to claim she should n't get nationality , nor that their decision is wise , nor the system does n't have its downsides , nor that it could n't be perfected . 
  i 'm just putting things in perspective . 
  nationality is complicated . 
  and there is a logic and a purpose behind this process . 
  this is pretty clear . 
  it depends on people 's opinions , but it 's clear . 
  regarding subjectivity in the choice , i do n't see a problem . 
  particularly because everything else is subjective . 
  the abstract notion of who is worthy of nationality via naturalisation is subjective . 
  how to best formalise that already subjective notion , is itself subjective . 
  does the portuguese requirement of 10 years living in the country , objectively guarantee that such a person is more worthy of becoming portuguese than someone else living there for 10 years ? 
  of course not . 
  subjectivity is inherent to the process , regardless . 
  the question is n't whether it is subject . 
  the question is whether it is functional and serves a purpose . 
  personally i think it makes sense to have a rough guarantee that other swiss do see this person as swiss . 
  and letting that up to the neighbours seems sensible . 
  can it ( subjectively ) result in some false negatives . 
  sure . 
  but you could argue the same with regards to very objective provisos . 
  that works as a joke , but that 's it , just a joke . 
  any extension to the primary citizenship attribution is normally bound by a bunch of provisos . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  you ignored my answer and repeated yourself . 
  like i replied above , none of this is very relevant . 
  switzerland follows ( primarily ) a `` jus sanguinis '' philosophy . 
  you 're arguing with a `` jus solis '' line of reasoning . 
  for the same reason , she 's a dutch citizen even though she 's living in switzerland since she 's 8 . 
  the netherlands too follows ( primarily ) a `` jus sanguinis '' philosophy . 
   what i said was `` neighbours get to vote specifically on your right to citizenship '' . 
  whose right ? 
  that generic unspecified `` your '' is where the dishonesty lies . 
  citizenship , in general , is not subject to such thing . 
  citizenship in switzerland follows a `` jus sanguinis '' philosophy . 
  and that is n't subject to such provisos . 
   scary to imagine a place where your neighbours get to vote specifically on your right to citizenship . 
  let 's not be intellectually dishonest here . 
  switzerland follows mainly a `` jus sanguinis '' , and not `` jus soli '' , approach to citizenship . 
  so , citizenship by blood . 
  in this context it is irrelevant to point out that she living there since she 's 8 . 
  that 's not the dominant perspective on the meaning of being swiss . 
  you could have never set foot in switzerland and you 'd be swiss anyway . 
  so in the general case , neighbours have no say in each others ' citizenship . 
  you do n't even need to have any swiss neighbours , nor do you need to live in switzerland . 
  neighbours have a say only with regards to naturalization . 
  and given they think of nationality as being mainly `` by blood '' , it is to be expected for them to have lots of restrictions on naturalization . 
  also , keep in mind that for the same reason , she does have dutch nationality , even though she 's living in switzerland since she 's 8 . 
  no , that would be the inversion of the statement ,  frontex chief : 42 % of rejected asylum seekers have been deported from the eu but that 's not what they say , nor what they mean . 
  whether you agree with their conclusion from the data is another matter . 
  frontex chief : 58 % of rejected asylum seekers are not deported from the eu, 
  it 's from a portuguese comedy sketch ( 2006 ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_coauxyr6u, 
  we regulate the shit out of education from kindergarten onwards , but religious leaders ca n't be subject to regulation . 
  i 've said it before , people nowadays just throw away labels they memorised and cling on to dogmatic ideas they barely understand . 
  freedom of religion . 
  fascism . 
  it 's a good idea come back to reality once in a while and actually argue in terms of practical effects once in a while , as a sanity check . 
  i 'm not ignoring eu data . 
  none of that contradicts the  6 % trade surplus . 
  also i 'm not going to waste my time debating conspiracy theorists who call the telegraph and ft far left . 
  the sources i posted were the telegraph and financial times ... to call that left wing conspiracy is ludicrous . 
   on a seasonally adjusted basis , exports rose 0.5 percent while imports went up 1.3 percent from the previous month . 
  yes , and the end result was being the rules for the 6th year in a row . 
  and nothing happens . 
  meanwhile portugal just got subject to an excessive deficit procedure with regards to a year ( 2015 ) where it can even be argued the limits were met , and during a year ( 2016 ) when all already indicated the limits were going to be met . 
   schaeuble is perfectly right , no community can survive without accepting the commonly agreed rules . 
  ** 2015 ** * germany 's record trade surplus is a bigger threat to euro than greece * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/11584031/germanys-record-trade-surplus-is-a-bigger-threat-to-euro-than-greece.html  this is the ** fifth consecutive year ** that ** germany 's surplus has been above 6pc ** of gdp . 
  the eu 's macroeconomic imbalance procedure states that the ** commission should launch infringement proceedings if this occurs for three years in a row ** , unless there is a clear reason not to . 
  ** 2016 ** * german trade surplus swells to fresh record * https://www.google.pt/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/61e3a997-8023-3a8e-bd84-1a92aa7938ec  germany 's balance in goods , services and payments with the rest of the world -- known as its current account -- has now grown to a record $ 30.4 bn in march , its highest monthly reading to date ...  germany has also long fallen foul of eu budget rules which limit member states to running current account surpluses of no more than 6 per cent of gdp . 
  the current account is set to hit 8.5 per cent this year , compared to 8.8 per cent in 2015 , according to the european commission . 
  not again , the same irrelevant hypothesis . 
  here 's an answer . 
  of course . 
  and because it 's about application , i talked about regulation rather than banning . 
  these laws are passed when they are a long way from making a difference . 
  not when the limit is close to being reached . 
  as for religious freedom , as i explained elsewhere , personally i have a lot of reservations about it . 
  firstly religious freedom needs to come with lots of checks and balances . 
  otherwise you can slap `` religion '' onto anything to be left alone . 
  right now islam poses a lot of problems . 
  -- by its own nature ( generalising , but it 's the only way to have a conversation ) , islam does n't fit a `` religious freedom '' framework . 
  just look into the general stance on apostasy . 
  look at organisations such as http://ex-muslim.org.uk or at the respective laws in muslim countries . 
  or more generally , look at freedom of religion across muslim countries to get an idea of what is generally professed . 
  -- another problem is that it is ripe with fundamentalism . 
  this means to many of the practitioners religion will always come before their country . 
  exacerbated nationalism is seen with a with a lot of suspicion in most of europe for obvious reasons , and rightly so , due to our history . 
  we should also look across the world to the the problems that religious fundamentalism brings to society . 
  identity is the fabric of society . 
  that which binds people together needs to be stronger than what separates them . 
  this is where patriotism plays a role . 
  it unites people and creates cohesion . 
  if at least part of society revolves much more strongly around a different foundation for identity , then it is compromised . 
  see ethnic ukrainians vs ethnic russians , or protestants vs catholics , or shi'a vs sunnis .
