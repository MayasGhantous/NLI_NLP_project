  * the dishonesty in numbers alone creates an advantage for france . 
  * being under the threat of sanctions itself is enough to hurt a countries outlook , effectively making it pay a price . 
  * portugal may still have its structural funds frozen , as of now there is still no decision on the subject, 
  as mentioned they are all above 3 % yet france was n't subject to the same excessive deficit procedure as portugal and spain . 
  but aside from that there is now reason to question where the numbers for france are even true . 
  that 's part of the point of the article . 
  also as a side note , the situation with portugal is n't as simple . 
   however its general government deficit came out at 4.4 % of gdp in 2015 , and the deadline was missed for correcting the deficit . 
  the overshoot was largely due to a financial sector support measure ( resolution of banif ) , though the deficit net of one-off measures would in any case have been above 3 % of gdp . 
  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/07/12-portugal-spain-excessive-deficit/ it is n't clear at all if , by the rules , the effects of banif resolution should count . 
  which is why the commission also argues it would still be above 3 \u2105 without banif . 
  but then the number , according to the commission would be 3.2 \u2105 . 
  however , as you can read in the article below , eurostat disagrees , and per their numbers the banif effect was 1.6 % , meaning the deficit without banif would be 2.8 % . 
  * according to the commission all exceeded the deficit , with france being at 3.5 % , but it was ignored in the case of france . 
  * it 's not clear banif impact should count , and without it by commission numbers portugal would be 3.2 % . 
  * according to eurostat , without banif portugal would be at 2.8 % . 
  * there 's reason to suspect france 's numbers actually being higher than 3.5 % . 
  -- not even getting into the fact that portugal was under troika 's supervision the whole time , and following a troika 's delineated plan . 
  one that has been pointed out to be flawed by the imf itself . 
  if you read it properly is says ** wrongful ** * or * . 
  it is at the very least wrongful since it goes against regulations . 
  the fact that it is a ** secret ** deal certainly makes it deceptive . 
  this is an absurd conversation because i 'm not telling you anything you do n't know . 
  that 's like saying that my job is to get the better tax deal for me and my family , so using my inside influence to have false declarations accepted is n't fraud . 
  https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fraud  ** 1 ** wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain . 
   ** 1.1 ** a person or thing intended to deceive others , typically by unjustifiably claiming or being credited with accomplishments or qualities . 
  what you said is debatable . 
  all countries in the eu chose to abide by eu rules . 
  so that amounts to fraud . 
  regardless , it is certainly not the commission 's job to make secret agreements with particular countries , freeing them from following the rules .

   perhaps you are right , but its not what my comment was about . 
  comments are about what 's written on them . 
  you wrote . 
   it was supposed to be about free movement of people , goods and ideas . 
  it 's not true . 
  that 's the eec , not the eu . 
    you do n't know what you 're talking about and you 're not listening  so immature . 
  shame . 
  that 's not immature , it 's factual . 
  if anything it was immature of you to be given a perfectly reasonable answer and reply with this . 
   you have an opinion ? 
  dont like it here ? 
  you can always leave !, 
   and you people were surprised by the brexit ... 
  it 's not about not liking . 
  it 's about claiming you expected something from the eu which the eu is not meant to be . 
  you basically said , i got the eu but i wanted the eec ( or the current eea ) . 
  those who got what you described were the like of norway ( eea member , non-eu member ) . 
  -- also as a sidenote :  now unelected elites dictate nations their policies . 
  who is unelected ? 
  the members of the council are elected ( leaders of each country ) . 
  the parliament is elected ( eu parliamentary elections ) . 
  the commission president is elected in the same way most heads of government are ( typically via parliament , here parliament + council ) . 
  the president of the council is elected by the council ( via qualified majority ) . 
  so who are these unelected people ? 
  there is a similarity between this and brexit in that you do n't know what you 're talking about and you 're not listening . 
  try reading his comment again . 
  what you described is what we had in the eec . 
  and it describes what we have today in the eea . 
  not the eu . 
  people did n't join the eu expecting to have what you described , because they had that in the eec . 
  the whole point of the eu was to evolve to a political organisation . 
  the fact that it even has a parliament should be a big hint . 
   some countries , like germany , consider chinese investment a threat for different reasons , while others like portugal need all the investment they can get in order to pick up steam . 
  this is true , but it lacks a lot of perspective . 
  the identity of portugal revolves around 3 axis , formalised by 3 corresponding institutions : nato , eu , and cplp ( community of portuguese speaking countries ) . 
  to understand portugal 's actions in world affairs you need to consider the three dimensions of its identity . 
  yet the latter , its lusophone identity , is often overlooked . 
  indeed portugal is a proud member of nato who takes its defence responsibilities seriously . 
  it 's also very pro europe . 
  but portugal 's own relationship with china is centuries old , and all things considered , it is a rather good relationship . 
  were we to get into matters of trust and mutual interest , there would be a case to be argued for china being a more trustworthy partner than germany . 
  it was germany who just recently `` back stabbed '' portugal on its onu sg candidacy , not china . 
  and it 's germany 's schaeuble who keeps playing dirty political games against portugal 's government . 
  if this idea of portugal and china as good partners seems naive , due to the sheer difference in size and power , keep in mind that while we do have a good direct relationship , we cooperate in the framework of ( roughly ) the cplp . 
  the 5th ministerial conference cplp-china just took place , and it was kind of a big deal . 
  https://youtu.be/prbzjdya0ca https://youtu.be/tnqj9zcwef8 http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-10/11/c_135746200.htm also the cplp is evolving and vastly improving cooperation . 
  in fact the xi cplp summit is taking place tomorrow ( with satellite conferences happening since a few days ago ) . 
  and the goal is to formalise this new vision for the cplp . 
  so this relationship with china is n't as subservient as some may think . 
  yes capital is badly needed . 
  but the partnership is also part of an emergent lusophone diplomacy . 
   if the pact is saved people will say the eu is undemocratic because one small region blocking the deal for the rest of the union is true democracy . 
   so maybe the 40 % are the strictly monolingual ones my understanding is the 40 % refers to portuguese as `` maternal language '' . 
  but as i said the situation in angola is very dynamic , and many of those whose maternal language was n't portuguese , later ( sometimes even still their youth ) moved towards portuguese as their primary language . 
  in any case , the home language of today is the maternal language of tomorrow . 
  and in the end that 's what matters . 
  that article always gets brought but it is so sensationalistic . 
  yes there is potential . 
  but assuming outstandingly optimistic scenarios is very disingenuous . 
  who knows , the exact opposite could happen . 
  for instance , the number of l2 speakers of french is very `` disproportional '' given their l1 size and importance on global affairs ... we could see less and people interested in french , in favour of say chinese or arabic . 
  and maybe in that long timeframe the arab world will become more stable , arabic will become more relevant , and french will be `` dropped '' as the language of diplomacy by the many arabic speakers who use it . 
  so much could happen if we 're free to speculate . 
  truth is , meanwhile both spanish and portuguese appear to be growing at a faster rate than french . 
   not even true for angola , where around 40 % are native speakers . 
  those figures certainly underestimate the situation in angola .
