  islamic fundamentalism , particularly in a world where patriotism is seen with suspicion , results in sub societies whose allegiance lies elsewhere . 
  and this weakens the nation and it 's a security risk . 
  -- finally within islam , extremism ( via wahhabism ) is spreading at a very rapid pace . 
  -- all these challenges are very real , and the danger they pose is , in my opinion , more worrying than subjective infractions of the ( a certain ) `` freedom of religion '' concept . 
  i do n't think what slovakia is doing should be the way forward . 
  i believe religion should be much more regulated . 
  we regulate kindergartens , and educators in general . 
  we set standards and certifications for lots of groups and entities . 
  religious groups should be no different . 
  children should have their own manuals , not be reading violent adult books . 
  the priests/imams/etc should all be state certified , and educated on ethics etc. 
  religious groups should need to adhere to certain norms , in particular accept freedom of religion themselves ( apostasy included ) . 
  the judicial aspect should be banned so that it is indeed a pure religion and not political movement etc. 
  that imo is the way it should be . 
  but because it would raise hell , it seems infeasible . 
  so i 'm not surprised governments try to find hacks that do the trick . 
  you did n't point out anything wrong in my answer . 
  as a side note , those are very high level classifications . 
  there 's numerous sects , some larger than others , and not all equally established . 
  also being established abroad does n't necessarily mean your country should accept it to be a religion . 
  as an example consider scientology that many countries accept as a religion and many others do n't . 
  since accreditation is done at a national level and according to national criteria , it is n't anything out of the ordinary to require a minimum of support to initiate that process . 
  you need to have some definition of what makes for a religion . 
  if i go to germany and consider me and my girlfriend followers of the religion of blahblahblah which we invented , will it be accepted as a religion ? 
  there are many ways to approach this dilemma . 
  one is to set a minimum number of followers in your country to consider it . 
   i said no , and explained . 
  i explained why it should be regulated . 
  by explain in taking about referring to the reality and pragmatics . 
  you ignored what i pointed out . 
  labeled things . 
  and described the status quo . 
  saying that religion is not politics , or that religions are international , is n't even the beginning of an argument . 
  it is irrelevant to my point , it ignores my point , and consists off just throwing out a few labels . 
  there are real world effects of policies , and any debate as to take as foundation these real world effects . 
  identity is the fabric of society . 
  it is the foundation of any nation . 
  if we neglect it , then it becomes fragile . 
  pretty much all major conflicts within nations result from a sense of identity stronger than that of nationality . 
  whether it is protestant vs christian , ethnic ukrainians vs ethnic russians , or shi'a vs sunni . 
  it is a threat to our security and sovereignty to let , within our society , have a parallel culture grow , that is brainwashed to be the most loyal to something other than the country , particularly when that something other dictates a complete notion of society and is associated and even controlled to an extent by other nation states . 
  when i mention the controls that are imposed to political parties , this does n't mean i 'm calling religion a political party . 
  this is n't about labeling . 
  this is about the fact that it too is a threat to the fabric of society . 
   who , and which religion ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_religion  religion and religous reasons ( to do something ) are subject to the laws every other reason or group of person is you 're ignoring what i wrote . 
  that which you 're replying to is the answer to this comment . 
  there are many laws and regulations directed at specific groups and entities in our society . 
  you ca n't have anyone just opening their own kindergarten where they take care of kids . 
  this is tightly regulated , and any kindergarten ( including staff ) needs to satisfy many requisites . 
  namely in terms of education/certification , and of good repute . 
  so what you are saying is that it should be subject to laws as any other group , while rejecting for it to be subject to the kind of control and oversight common in our society for many groups . 
   -_- religions are not * political * parties and not limited by country borders . 
  if they act as a lobbying group to represent interests , they are free to do as any other grassroots movement or corporation within the limits of the law . 
  you 're pointing out that , according to our laws , they can do that . 
  i said as much in my comment . 
  i explained why it should n't be that way . 
  to answer by reiterating what the current status quo is adds nothing to the conversation . 
  this is n't about it become * the * official religion , but an officially recognised religion in the territory . 
  the current law required 25k followers for it to happen ( ~ 0.5 % of the population ) . 
  you may say it wo n't happen any time soon , but chances of it happening certainly are n't zero . 
   i 'm no fan of islam , but this is not the state 's business i completely disagree . 
   the seperation of church is not a dogma . 
  in fact some european countries today even have a national religion associated with their monarchy . 
  while i do not want a state religion , i am all for religion being a `` state business '' . 
  in the sense that it should be regulated and there should be oversight . 
  religion is a big part of people 's identity . 
  identity determines allegiance . 
  identity is the very core of the fabric of society . 
  as of now we tolerate religious entities to brainwash people in ways that would we would never tolerate the state to ( not even close ) . 
  religious entities that are often associated with other states or proto notions of state . 
  we regulate all sorts of teaching . 
  yet religious teaching has no state defined requirements , or checks . 
  we regulate political parties and block outside influence , yet very rarely do we limiting external funding of religions . 
  we negotiate trade deals to achieve some sort of balance between imports and exports , yet we open our arms to religious ideologies promoted by the most closed and protective religious states . 
  [ google translation ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://e-global.pt/noticias/mundo/europa/eslovaquia-adota-legislacao-para-impedir-que-islao-possa-tornar-se-religiao-oficial/ ), 
  it has everything to do with eurobonds . 
  you yourself said , about eurobonds :  we shouldnt sacrifice basic democratic principles like `` no taxation without representation '' so this is the setup that allows for representation to exist . 
  the article itself says :  the plan set out by mr hollande on sunday repeats comments he made last week , on bastille day , calling for an '' ** economic government of the eurozone ** ''  and suggesting that '' ** we can also , later , go further and have a budget for the eurozone ** so that we can act and invest in member states , including those that are lagging behind . 
  so you set up governance , then setup budget . 
  once you have both , eurobonds naturally fit the institutional framework . 
   but what i have heard so far well , not after you read the link i just gave you . 
  in any case , i agree ( as i think would most proponents of eurobonds ) . 
  you 'd need a large common budget ( for critical certain fundamental areas ) and a eurozone government/parliament to manage it / oversee it 's management . 
  this is a typical `` no true scotsman '' . 
  the eu already is a political union . 
  in any case , of course there would need to be specific ez institutions . 
  right after the greek debacle this is what the french side pushed for : * france 's hollande seeks support for eurozone parliament * http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33598868, 
  obviously , otherwise we would n't be debating whether debt mutualization is needed as a complement to common currency . 
  this is n't a new topic . 
  long before the euro was a done deal , there was precisely the debate of whether it could possibly work without mutual debt and large common budget . 
  in fact all the existing problems were predicted , and hope was that when they did arise , they 'd be dealt with by fixing the wholes . 
  here is an example of an article giving an historical overview . 
  separate sovereign states that voluntarily choose to hand up part of their sovereignty , as eu and as ez members . 
  firstly , ranking up debt is partially a consequence of their higher interest rates . 
  their interest rates would n't have gone up nearly much with common debt ( keep in mind greece is a tiny economy ) . 
  also , common ez debt comes with a common large ez budget , managed at an ez level . 
  so the ez would have much more oversight . 
  the recente soul/hip-hop album from portugal is in my opinion rather good .
