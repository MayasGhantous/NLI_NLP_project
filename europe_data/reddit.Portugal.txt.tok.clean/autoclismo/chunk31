   then do n't blame the fucking eu for it . 
  the eu is an economical and political union of nations . 
  in particular the heads of state for each eu nation , together define the european council , which defines the eu 's overall political direction and priorities . 
  they wussed out because , like i said , they had a rather weak hand . 
  the time to play tough was in the beginning , long before syriza , when they had germany and france by the balls . 
  there was a lot of criticism are the time even writing the imf , as it was clear germany and france were being bailed out by the international community . 
  adding insult to injury , we get to watch germany assuming a position of moral superiority , when any such concept of morality of the onus on both , debtor and creditor . 
  this is where greece got played . 
  they should have acted tough in the very beginning , when the possibility of them going bankrupt meant a devastating blow on france and germany . 
  instead they were given deals where the they got international financial aid , that was prioritized to pay much of their creditors . 
  meaning the `` bailouts '' actually saved germany and france ( and with them the rest of europe ) , giving them money and time to protect themselves from a collapse of greece . 
  and now greece 's hand is rather weak . 
   only because it is 29 countries combined . 
  that 's the whole point . 
   the uk has the second largest economy in the eu and is larger than 19 of the other 28 countries combined . 
  you 're dealing with the 28 combined . 
   if the uk was so pathetic economically wise the eu would n't be so worried about us leaving and the euro would n't have tanked in june . 
  relative to the pound it went up . 
  -- all your points , with regard to uk vs the rest of the eu , show the eu as having the upper hand . 
  for instance this ,  judges said there could only be a violation of the law -- originally aimed against street movements such as the early nazi party -- if the uniforms were `` suggestively ** militant ** or ** intimidating ** '' so even solely with regards to uniform , the matter is not only whether they were impersonating police or not . 
  -- of course then one could also argue harassment , amongst other things . 
  not to mention the whole status quo is completely biased and perverted . 
  i 'd really like to see atheists or christians doing this in muslim neighbourhoods in germany . 
  eat bacon , god does not we exist / convert to christianity . 
  surely that would end really well and the court would also dismiss any complaints . 
   since no sane person could mistake these guys for real police officers , what they did was n't illegal . 
  that reasoning assumes police impersonation to be the ( only ) accusation . 
  you 'd know it 's not the case by looking at the article . 
  if large economy is the argument , then the uk should be the one bending over since eu 's economy is far larger . 
  from the article :  the same court had already thrown out the case last year , but was overruled on appeal by a higher court ( ... )  monday 's verdict is not yet final and may still be appealed . 
   did you think that just because they 're `` refugees '' that does n't mean that they 're horrible people . 
  not at all . 
  that 's the thing , seems like today you have to pick between being humane and not being stupid . 
  it seems like in order to help one has to pretend to live in fantasy land . 
  it 's important to help conscious of what the reality is . 
  so that should be weighed in how much help one provides and how that help is provided . 
  it does n't have to be all or nothing . 
  honestly this does n't seem like a matter of lack of resources , but misguided policies . 
  much of these people should n't be here . 
  why is he in bulgaria and not afghanistan ? 
  why are we wasting money feeding him ? 
  i actually am for helping refugees . 
  but it seems like we are getting soft to the point where we become dysfunctional . 
  and that 's not good for us , nor the refugees we 're trying to help . 
  but how many years ? 
  this says people studying in `` upper secondary '' pretty sure french comes 2nd after english in portugal . 
  but most people will just study it for a few years ( most will probably do 7-9 grades , i think ) . 
  that said french took a big hit . 
  before my time french and english were on equal footing . 
  when i was in school most people studied both , picking english as their main , that 's 5-11/12 grades , and french just 7-9 . 
  these days english is compulsory and begins in primary school , while french is facing more and more competition from spanish and german . 
  also chinese is trying to gain some traction ( still early days though ) . 
  edit : as a side note , while french has potential , it faces lots of problems . 
  the huge number of l2 speakers is a relic of the past , when french was a lingua franca . 
  it is n't anymore and france importance on worlds affairs diminished . 
  at the same time much of the francophone africa may very well start questioning the need for french . 
  many of these countries are islamic and arabic is spreading . 
  the profile arabic is also increasing . 
  so if you have a global important language as your own ( as opposed to some barely relevant african idiom ) , and the lingua franca is english , why a need for french ?

   but i am not saying that the danger has increased . 
  you said :  and yes , it is possible that the influx of refugees will drive up those stats so it appears you did say exactly that . 
  and if you did n't , even though it seemed , i will say it . 
  because it 's pretty damned obvious that the danger is bound to increase . 
  a lot . 
  it 's profoundly absurd to claim otherwise . 
  when you said that `` it was equally true before the refugees came in '' . 
  the only thing that is equally true is that it could possibly happen . 
  which is an irrelevant statement . 
  it 's equally true that you could get shot in warsaw or in allepo . 
  but it 's a true statement that is irrelevant . 
   here is the thing about this argument : it was equally true before the refugees came in . 
  what is equally true ? 
  that it could happen ? 
  yes . 
  that it was as likely to happen ? 
   and yes , it is possible that the influx of refugees will drive up those stats see . 
  and this matters . 
  a lot . 
  to pretend it does n't is extremely disingenuous . 
  it 's quite telling that one must resource to such absurd arguments to justify one 's position . 
  sure , like i said , i sympathise and in your place chances are i 'd do the same . 
  not criticising , just pointing out what seems like a very bad consequence . 
  i probably would n't , i 'm not really criticising who leaves . 
  while i can sympathise , i 'd rather not see all secular westernised turks moving out of turkey , living the country in the hands of conservative fundamentalists . 
   the reason the court decided the way it did was , for one , because the state resorted to those drastic measures * too soon * . 
  it could have been justified to take away those kids , but the state should first have done its best to try and remedy the no job/no money situation or find some other solution less destructive to the plaintiff 's family life . 
  i would say that even the few details i posted are enough to show that opinion to be ~ ~ borderline ~ ~ retarded . 
  she 's on her 10th kid . 
  not 3rd , not 4th ... 10th . 
  it 's the gift that keeps on giving and it 's not going to stop . 
  as i said it 's by religious conviction ( at least of her mostly absent husband ) . 
  she basically procreates . 
  and money and job are not her only problems . 
  the kids were completely neglected . 
  they do n't have to pay to get vaccinations or to go to school . 
  and her 13 year old did n't get pregnant for lack of money . 
  that family , if you can call it that , is completely dysfunctional . 
  she can barely take care of herself let alone 10 others . 
  in fact if you do want to help her , the best way is indeed to convince her to get sterilised .
