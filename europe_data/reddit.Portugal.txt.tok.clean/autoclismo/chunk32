  sounds harsh but it 's not like she does n't have any kids . 
  or just one . 
  or two . 
  she has ten !, 
  you 're definitely not going to get any job , if you 're constantly pregnant , having to care for ten kids , plus all the grandchildren whose mothers are your pre teens . 
  nor are you going to be a better mother with an ever growing family with ever growing problems . 
  the whole thing is idiotic . 
  quite frankly , i start questioning the principles defended by the echr . 
  more and more , it sounds like real life tumblrism . 
  recently portugal was condemned for taking the kids off some cabo verdean woman and pressuring her to opt for tubal ligation so she does n't have any more kids . 
  the state took 7 out of ** 10 ** of her kids . 
  wife of a muslim from guinea bissau who has a total of three wife 's . 
  against the use of contraceptives for religious reasons . 
  no stable job , no money , kids neglected in every sense , education , hygiene , food , health . 
  one of her daughter 's got pregnant too at 13 years old . 
  case was taken to echr and now she 's getting her kids back +15 k $ in reparations . 
  it 's mind blowing , absolutely retarded . 
  not only because it 's terrible for the kids , but because it 's terrible for society . 
  but you ca n't do anything , just watch the problem grow exponentially . 
  add to that cases with decisions where religious freedom is defended in such a way that religion actually gives people special rights . 
  personally i find that these supposedly progressive ethics are in practice a good way to set us back many decades . 
   the question is why you want to keep a lid on this by down voting ? 
  will the problem go away if we do n't look at it ? 
  schaeuble when asked about deutsche bank starts talking about how he 's worried about portugal instead . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-12/schaeuble-says-portugal-debt-woes-trump-strong-deutsche-bank problems do n't go away if you do n't look at them , but it 's really convenient to have people looking elsewhere . 
  speculation is a bitch . 
  i 'm never sure , when faced with these answers , of people really `` do n't get it '' or just do n't care . 
  nationality as a social construct precedes nationality as a legal construct . 
  the legal rules are an attempt to formalise a preexisting social construct . 
  the rules are clear and objective , as opposed to the social contract which is fuzzy and subjective . 
  but also rules are heuristic , and oftentimes do fail their purpose . 
  and they can be amended to do a better job at implementing the underlying social expectations . 
  as a practical example , in portugal , if a foreign couple has kids in the territory , the kids do not automatically get portuguese citizenship . 
  they are entitled to it however once they complete primary school ( in portugal ) . 
  this is n't arbitrary . 
  it is based on the expectation that , in general , in such conditions , kids are very likely to be integrated / assimilated , to a large extent . 
  but it is heuristic and it could fail to meet the assumptions that justify it . 
  in such cases , the legal validity of the acquired citizenship will be seen by society as an `` unfortunate accident '' . 
  a legal artifact , resulting from an implementation that will necessarily be heuristic and therefore flawed . 
   nor can they perform any fire-fighting mission .

  judging collectives is n't judging people as a collective . 
  and you do need to judge collectives . 
  the claim is n't that all `` foreigner/refugee/moslem '' are `` evil '' , as / u/treverios implied . 
  nor even that a majority of them are . 
  the claim is that in these populations , the percentage of people willing to commit these atrocities , is `` significant '' . 
  here `` significant '' means that the ratio is big enough that you will experience such incidents regularly , caused by people in a minority community , when such incidents are rarer in the reminder of the majority of the population . 
  that is n't changed by the fact that most in such minorities are good people , or even brave people willing to help people out against the bad apples in their community . 
  there is an obvious and undeniable trend . 
  in portugal , i think we had only taken about 200 refugees under the relocation programme , when one of them , an eritrean , physically assaulted ( multiple facial bones broken ) and raped a 67 year old homeless woman . 
  yes it 's just a data point . 
  but either we happened to hit the jackopt with those couple hundred refugees , or perhaps this just is n't that rare amongst certain populations . 
  the latter being a much sensible explanation for people who have followed the news and/or have an idea about life in eritrea . 
   we wo n't have to take into account the economic concerns of countries like greece , bulgaria , romania , etc. 
  in order to formulate a position . 
  true . 
  however , the resulting eu position still concerns you , even though you do n't have a say . 
  suppose you do accept chlorinated chicken . 
  then trade with the eu will imply more checks , to certify that whatever chicken meat crosses to the eu complies with eu regulations . 
  so yes you can ignore the requisites of such countries . 
  but all other countries will also ignore your positions . 
  and the further we drift away , the more difficult and complex and costly uk/eu trade will be . 
  and we are your biggest market .

  angola will not sign a document , foreign minister said . 
  the european union ( eu ) was one of the entities invited by the national electoral commission ( cne ) of angola , appointed by the president of the republic , jos\u00e9 eduardo dos santos , to observe the angolan general elections , such as , among others , the african union ) , community of portuguese speaking countries ( cplp ) or southern african development community ( sadc ) . 
  according to the sunday edition of the jornal de angola , the eu asked the angolan government to sign a memorandum of understanding to observe the general elections on 23 august . 
  the claim was rejected , according to statements by angolan foreign minister georges chikoti on saturday ( 15.07 ) . 
  `` the invitation is open , but we do not want any specific agreements with each of these organizations . '', 
  anyone who wants to come , whoever does not want to , may not come , but the truth is that the invitation is open , `` georges chikoti was quoted as saying . 
  according to the minister , the memorandum proposed by the european union provided for the circulation and visit of the observers throughout the national territory , also demanding security , an element with which , said georges chikoti , the angolan government has committed . 
  `` but that does not mean we have to sign a memorandum of understanding with any of the observers , '' the minister said , adding that the only institutions with which angola has specific treaties on election observation are the african union and sadc . 
  `` we do not expect anyone to impose our way of looking at the elections and give us some lessons , but we do not want to give lessons in elections . 
  terms of elections '' , he said . 
  nevertheless , he insisted that the european union `` is invited , like other organizations , '' to observe the angolan elections . 
  * lack of political will ? 
  * last week , in an interview with dw africa , portuguese mep [ ana gomes accused the angolan authorities of not being interested in european observation ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.pt&amp;sl=pt-br&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.dw.com/pt-002/haver%25c3%25a1-observadores-europeus-nas-elei%25c3%25a7%25c3%25b5es-gerais-angolanas/a-39563693 ) . 
  luanda 's invitation to the european union 's participation in electoral observation only arrived on tuesday ( 04.07 ) , according to the mep confirmed . 
  ana gomes also said that `` the invitation is not explicit about the conditions required by the eu for the performance of the functions of observation missions regarding the guarantees of the independence of access to all entities and localities . '', 
  in may , the head of the european union delegation in angola , tomas ulicny , issued a statement on the organization 's website , which , among other subjects , reiterated the eu 's willingness `` to support the national electoral commission in strengthening its institutional capacity and in carrying out the work with the political parties and other relevant actors . 
  we also express our willingness to send a mission to observe the elections . '', 
  * three thousand observers * it should be recalled that in press statements on june 30 , cne spokeswoman j\u00falia ferreira said that the angolan president , jos\u00e9 eduardo dos santos , presented a list of 12 entities for electoral observation , including international organizations , including the european union . 
  for the 2017 elections the number of 3,000 national and international observers was stipulated . 
  sadc observers are expected to arrive in angola two weeks before the august 23 elections , and representatives of the african union the week before . 
  angola will have 9,317,294 voters in the general elections on august 23 , according to official cne data . 
  i have to begin by going back . 
   in 20 years the country did much much more than in his 40 years . 
  this was your initial assertion , which you just dropped , moving on to another argument . 
  it is indeed quite ironic that you 'd make an argument of bad governance , by contrasting with a period where we went bankrupt twice , and then developed using eec funds . 
  but that 's not the sole problem . 
  even if we had done well afterwards , which we did n't as it was quite disastrous , that would tell us very little about previous times . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  a biased comparison of apples and oranges . 
  lets look at this :  portugal was at war , ...  edit : on top of that remember that portugal was not involved in the wwii , how biased is this ? 
  you begin by chastising him because we were at war ( in the colonies ) , as if that was a simple subject and it was all his fault . 
  but of course then you do mention that we did not get involved in wwii , but certainly not to give him any credit . 
  if you 're going to make arguments of war , does that not matter to you ? 
  that while others were dying we managed to stay out of it ? 
  you realise that during that period we did , comparatively , quite ok . now let me be clear , my answer to you is not meant to take discussion in that direction , but to show how bad this kind of reasoning is .
