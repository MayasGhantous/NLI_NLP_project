  yes , i do think he did well by keeping us out of wwii , and i agree his colonial policies were quite problematic , namely in managing the conflict . 
  however history ca n't be dumbed down . 
  i 'm not going to to claim portugal had better governance than france , because they were at involved in wwii and we were n't . 
  that 's just intellectually dishonest . 
  likewise it 's great that slovenia was n't involved in colonial wars but that is n't evidence of better governance than portugal . 
  we all had our problems to deal with and those were complicated times . 
   compare portugal and the rest of europe before and after his rule , the gap grew incredibly . 
  the `` rest of europe '' is pretty big and heterogeneous . 
  but again , this takes us nowhere . 
  after his rule , we were enduring a war . 
  it 's expected that we wo n't be doing too well during a war . 
   in 20 years the country did much much more than in his 40 years . 
  portugal was bankrupt before his rule . 
  portugal went bankrupt twice after his rule ( 1977 and 1983 ) , and was helped by eec funds ( 1985 onwards ) . 
  these comparisons make no sense .

  paiva benido , 40 , who was part of the national contingent in the european union training mission in mali , died sunday of an attack by rebel elements that left several soldiers dead , including a portuguese one , according to the army . 
  according to the brief statement sent this morning to the newsrooms , the portuguese military man who was injured , which is not identified , `` is already fully recovered . '', 
  according to another statement from the joint staff of the armed forces , the `` terrorist attack '' occurred at the hotel le campement kangaba `` recognized and authorized by eutm mali as wellfare center between periods of operational activity of the military serving in this country . '', 
  army source told lusa this morning that sergeant-helper gil fernando paiva benido , married and father of two young daughters , was a native of valongo and served in the personnel command in oporto . 
  it was also through a statement that the minister of defense expressed `` in his own name and on behalf of the government , deep regret for the death of the military '' , adding that `` the attack that occurred yesterday [ at 4:00 p.m. ] in the vicinity of bamako , '' capital of mali . 
  according to the ministry of defense , `` the precise contours of this attack are unknown , and an inquiry has already been carried out by the general staff of the armed forces to know in detail the circumstances in which it occurred . '', 
  portugal currently has an outstanding national force of 10 military personnel serving the european union mission in mali . 
  i should get some sleep ... 
  the one in the article ? 
  banco popular . 
   it is indeed the first time the single resolution board acts . 
  the bes case was handled by the national authorities before the single resolution mechanism entered into force . 
  it is also the first case with the current solvency rules in place , which require banks to hold a greater amount of `` bail-inable '' instruments . 
  true , fair points . 
  this is n't quite true , as far as i know . 
  this was n't exactly the first test . 
  the ( ~ ~ also ~ ~ portuguese ) bes used the same resolution mechanisms first . 
  they were n't obliged to do so at the time , but they did . 
  indeed only subordinated creditors were bailed in ( at first ) , but i 'm pretty sure regulations allow for senior bond holders and even deposit holders (  100k eur ) to be bailed in if needed . 
  and in fact , in a second phase , after asset separation and having the resolution fund take over the so called `` good bank '' , they ended up having to also bail in institutional senior bond holders . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/9f276d60-b55b-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51  europe 's new regime for winding up failing banks has made an inauspicious start , as investors lashed out at the european central bank for allowing portugal to impose losses on almost $ 2bn of senior bondholders in novo banco . 
   the central bank of portugal last week moved five of 52 senior novo banco bond issues to the `` bad bank '' it set up to hold the lender 's toxic assets after a bailout of banco esp\u00edrito santo in mid-2014 . 
  furthermore , the current deal being formulated to sell the so called resulting `` good bank '' ( named `` novo banco '' ) , requires a public guarantee , and a deal with institutional creditors to downgrade debt . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/e9f81fed-729c-3845-85d3-f07686924a8a  under the agreement , the resolution fund -- a public body that is jointly financed by all of portugal 's banks -- is committed to injecting fresh capital into novo banco if its capital strength falls below regulatory requirements , the bank of portugal said in a statement . 
   this clause will only be triggered , however , if the capital shortfall results from impairments on designated problem loans held in a so-called side bank , from which novo banco has been selling off non-core assets . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/be73005e-49fb-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b  as a condition of the sale , at least $ 500m of senior novo banco bonds will be exchanged for new , higher risk bonds in a `` liability management exercise '' designed to strengthen the bank 's capital ratios . 
  in portugal , ana bacalhau the lead singer of the world/neofado band deolinda , just released her first solo work : ** ana bacalhau - ci\u00fame ** https://youtu.be/vbmfywclwoe https://open.spotify.com/track/5uk226yiu00jnortnj7oq5 -- the singer tatanka released two new singles yesterday . 
  acoustic chill . 
  here is my favourite of the two . 
  ** tatanka - alfaiate ** https://youtu.be/lhjoadgvom8 -- the band magano blends folk from the alentejo region with other sonorities . 
  they released this somewhat jazzy take on traditional song . 
  ** magano - montinho ** https://youtu.be/ajruh90zhyg -- finally , the instrumental folk band torga , also released a fresh interpretation of azorean sounds . 
  like i said , i just gave up :p but i think i included them in my follow up comment . 
  glad you like it !, 
  i do n't think portugal has a lot to offer with regards to metal ( although maybe i 'm just ignorant of it ) . 
  there 's moonspell of course , but you must know them already . 
  here 's alice , they 're pretty good . 
  https://youtu.be/agoxgzzdooa comboio fantasma , are promising . 
  but perhaps more hard rock than metal . 
  https://youtu.be/aji1qa6-1ou they have better tracks , check out `` puzzle '' for istance , https://open.spotify.com/artist/5315pri9w0llzrxdbrburt honestly ca n't think of much more . 
  wanted to check metal tracks i may have posted before , but reddit 's search by author seems broken : /, 
  it does  that said , my bad that it 's not more diverse . 
  was going to be , but as i said , was getting to big and have up . 
  here 's just a few tracks you may like more if `` saudade '' is n't your thing .

  if you check / r/musicanova you 'll find a lot of variety . 
  firstly , for portuguese music checkout / r/somluso and for music in portuguese checkout / r/musicanova . 
  it 's very hard to make a short list . 
  i 'm terrible at this ... 
  it just got longer and longer then gave up .

  that 's vague enough to be true or false depending on interpretation . 
  that said , i 'd say things like this are evidence of some soft power also by portuguese speaking countries , https://youtu.be/tnqj9zcwef8 full keynote speech , https://youtu.be/cn70riebegm, 
  i do n't know enough about arabic to provide an educated answer . 
  my guess , and it 's just a guess , would be that on the developed north african world ( morocco to libya ) it 's mutually intelligible , and likewise in the middle east . 
  should that be true , i would also expect that these two groups would be relatively acquainted with each other 's varieties , or at least could easily become so . 
  should i be right , then that 's all you need . 
  they 're big enough in number and power . 
  those in sudan and chad would become acquainted by the stronger dialects and on the long term possibly influenced by them . 
  people from texas may have a hard time in glasgow , but that 's not much of a big deal . 
  those in glasgow understand americans , and accent in scotland is becoming `` softer '' . 
   but the big population growth in french speaking africa is mostly in ~ ~ west african countries ~ ~ ... underdeveloped countries . 
  population growth and development are inversely associated . 
  the fact that say , algeria is much more developed than drc , makes the former particularly important , more so than the latter i would claim . 
  not saying numbers do n't count . 
  they do . 
  but putting more importance on the most underdeveloped because they reproduce more , does n't seem quite right . 
   nearly 60 years after their independence it is still alive and they even have to give it a more important role . 
  or we could say it took 60 years to do so . 
  it 's a recent political decision , therefore fragile . 
  it is certainly very plausible that french will dominate northern africa . 
  it 's just not completely certain in my view . 
  french wo n't leave the region , for sure . 
  but i find it hard to dismiss , on a long term perspective , competition from arabic in that region . 
  you ca n't compare e.g. 
  algeria or morocco with angola , with regards to how they relate with the french/portuguese language . 
  and again , i 'm not making claims that portuguese is stronger in africa ( i know it is n't ) . 
  i 'm just curious to see how things will play out in the north with regards to balance between french and arabic . 
   i did n't count ~ 90 million vs ~ 100 million true , i misread , sorry about that . 
   it 's already almost 1/3 of the total `` arabic '' population , and do n't forget morocco is not an arabic country but mostly a berber country ( they make up 60 % of the population ) . 
  ok , but you have n't yet `` won them over '' . 
  yes the step you mentioned is important , but on the long term there 's still strong competition with arabic ( yes even if 60 % of the population is berber ) . 
   sure , the situation is simpler when you just have 5 countries , including 2 with less than 1 million inhabitants . 
  even there there 's question marks .
