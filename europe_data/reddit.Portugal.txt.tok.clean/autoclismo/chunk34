  some big ones in guinea bissau ( officially portuguese but with more french speakers ) . 
  and in even in cape verde while most speak portuguese ( non natively ) and is the sole official language , there 's some creole empowerment movements . 
  these could potentially in the long term relegate portuguese to the position of `` foreign language '' ( not saying any of this will happen , but could ) . 
   i mean , i get your point , but i do n't see how comparing [ this ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrique_francophone#/media/file:francophone_africa.svg ) to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese-speaking_african_countries#/media/file:palop.svg ) is really relevant . 
  i 'm not in any way comparing that . 
  although maybe perhaps i could have been more clear . 
  my sole point is one of predicability . 
  there 's no doubt french is and will be a major language in africa , and stronger than portuguese . 
  not claiming otherwise . 
  but if you ask how strong , then that is very dependent on arabic . 
  those are a pretty large percentage ( even if not the majority ) and very important countries . 
  those numbers alone do n't show the reality of portuguese in africa . 
  that 's a table for native speakers ( therefore first language ) and estimates the number at 13.7 m. 
  now consider angola , where 71.5 % of a population of 25.7 m speaks portuguese , that is 18.29 m just there . 
  source : http://observalinguaportuguesa.org/angola-portugues-e-falado-por-7115-de-angolanos/ so just in angola you have  18m speakers ( even if not native ) . 
  now consider that portuguese is expanding also as their home language , and consequently their native language . 
  other languages are prevalent mostly amongst the older generations in less urban ( less developed ) areas . 
  soon the whole population will speak portuguese , and the vast majority as the/a first language . 
  -- the kiswahili language suffers from many of the problems i described . 
  spreads across countries , and in some not a national language . 
  competes in many places with much more powerful national/offical languages . 
  multiple dialects and some mutually unintelligible . 
  lack of and rudimentary norms ( e.g. 
  defective orthography ) . 
  lack of resources etc. 
  you 're right my bad . 
  should have said `` many '' rather than most . 
  in any case , you counted ~ 90 million vs ~ 100 million . 
  whatever the exact numbers are , the problem remains that there is a large overlapping with arabic speaking countries , and arabic is a strong language ( it 's one of the 6 un official languages for instance ) . 
  what you mention regarding morocco moving education to french is indeed a point towards french . 
  but it 's just one country , who will continue to be native in arabic , and who knows what the future will bring . 
  my point is that it 's a very different situation from that of say , angola with respect to portuguese , where portuguese is most people 's native language , and the home language for the vast majority ( and home language is the future native language ) . 
   portuguese is the 17 ^ th most-spoken language in africa . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  could well be the case , not claiming it is n't , but i 'd like to see a source with the ranking . 
   how eurocentric is that view ? 
  i do n't think it is that biased . 
  first consider the status quo with regards to official languages . 
  these that i mentioned do dominate . 
  furthermore , some languages may have lots of speakers , but a lot of problems too . 
  * not being a national language ( regardless of official status ) . 
  some languages are spoken across countries , sometimes among an ethnicity . 
  but not being spoken by a whole country diminishes its usefulness . 
  in fact outside languages are often seen as more neutral in that sense , and politically easier to adopt . 
  * too much dialectal variation the native languages tend to form a dialectal continuum with a lot of varieties . 
  this variation leads to practical problems . 
  * lack of academic studies , formalisation , tools , etc. 
  some languages even lack a writing system . 
  an example in the portuguese world be cape verde who just recently formalised and made official a writing system for creole . 
  you need grammatical studies and norms , tools such as available dictionaries , manuals etc. 
  * lack of resources you have lots of resources dumped onto the expansion of french/english/portuguese in africa . 
  not so much for other languages . 
  * political and diplomatic strategy money aside , even from a political and diplomatical standpoint , it 's a good idea to adopt multi continental languages . 
  look for instance at negotiations between china and portuguese speaking countries via forum macau . 
  languages promote unions . 
  -- as sidenote , with regards to portuguese in africa . 
  in this case both angola and mozambique already do have portuguese as their most spoken language . 
  i think it 's the case in s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and pr\u00edncipe . 
  in cape verde portuguese is the sole official language , but most people are native in creole . 
  there also appear to be some movements that want to empower creole ( they just made teaching bilingual rather than just portuguese based ) . 
  at the same time cooperation with portugal is steadily increasing and there 's talks of free movement between both countries . 
  so let 's see . 
  in guinea bissau the situation is more complicated . 
  due to political instability portuguese has n't expanded as much ( desire being the site official language ) . 
  native guineense creole is the norm , and french os expanding due to neighbouring countries . 
  indeed , english is and will continue to be l\u00edngua franca . 
  that said , most other top languages are becoming more important ( or have the potential to do so in the short/medium term ) . 
  in africa for instance , we have french , portuguese , english and arabic . 
  these are the big 4 in that continent . 
  so all four should benefit from a developing african continent . 
  in the case of french , there 's a question mark due to the rise of arabic . 
  ~ ~ most ~ ~ many african french speaking countries speak arabic natively . 
  french will certainly rise , the question is how much , where will lie the balance between french and arabic . 
  portuguese has already seen a major boost . 
  go back a couple of decades and e.g. 
  angola/mozambique/guinea bissau would be deep into civil war . 
  these countries so suffer from corruption and bad economics , but the situation is very different . 
  angola for instance , produces a lot of content . 
  there 's already significant demand for portuguese from neighbouring countries ( e.g. 
  namibia , senegal , etc ) . 
  in the case of portuguese we could still talk about recent developments in macau ( with portugal and china trying to revive the language there , and make it the centre of interaction between china and portuguese speaking countries ) . 
  and we could talk about east timor , where the number of speaker is rising ( although the situation is fragile ) . 
  and of course there would be much to say about spanish , mandarin , more about arabic , etc. 
  ps : today is the day `` portuguese language and culture in the cplp '' : https://youtu.be/00dy1zpvy6g, 
  here are a few music ( video ) releases , from portugal , from the last week ( or so ) .

  it does n't matter that they are a fraction . 
  point is you ca n't make these kind of analogies . 
  they are absurd . 
  i find it very hard to believe that they are not informed . 
  firstly , as i posted elsewhere , the whole reason why we have few people coming , is precisely because they choose not to take the offers . 
  and those who come and do n't stay are essentially running away . 
  it 's not like they 're just dumped there and have no one to express their desire or intention to go elsewhere . 
  there 's a lot of things you ca n't compare . 
  that did n't stop you though . 
   edit : i mean , portuguese themselves have been leaving the country by the thousands for the last decade that 's really disingenuous . 
  pretty sure not 38 % of the population as left . 
  also , while many portuguese leave there 's also foreigners coming to portugal looking for a better life ( e.g. 
  something in between . 
  * `` do you want to go to portugal and stay there , or stay in this camp in greece waiting for other offers from countries such as sweden ?
