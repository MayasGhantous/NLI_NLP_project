  portuguese is growing rapidly in angola even as a first language . 
  i 've seen references to those figures for years , so they must be outdated . 
  but also , even many of those who learned another national language first , are now using primarily portuguese . 
  most young people seem to be adopting portuguese as their primary language . 
  the new single by former eurovision participant , sara tavares . 
  * sara tavares - coisas bunitas * https://youtu.be/d7rlq5flory sara tavares is portuguese , of cape verdean descent . 
  she 's represented portugal in the eurovision in 1994 , reaching 8th place . 
  it 's been 7 years since her last album . 
  ** portugal ** i really like the new work by cristina branco . 
  cristina branco - e \u00e0s vezes dou por mim https://youtu.be/q4adg0slwbg here is her latest [ album ] ( https://open.spotify.com/album/3agnb6pudkurtxygvbzl2v ) on spotify . 
  not saying it 's my favourite song , or that she 's my favourite artist . 
  it 's impossible to pick . 
  that 's good stuff . 
  for more music from portugal or in portuguese , check out / r/somluso and / r/musicanova . 
   britain does not have the needed things to be a competitor like china , usa or brazil . 
  to clarify , what i meant was competitor in the sense that it will also be trying to sign trade deals with these countries . 
  should the uk manage to do so before the eu , it would be a political and economical loss for the european union . 
  i 'm not an expert on southern american politics . 
  but my perception is that unasur ( or unasul in portuguese ) , being essentially mercosul + can is still , in a sense , a proto-organisation . 
  its goal is to , eventually , supersede both . 
  but it has n't yet . 
  and my understanding is it 's far from achieving that goal . 
  mercosul itself still seems rather disunited . 
  but as i said , take my answer with a grain of salt . 
  my knowledge on this particular matter is somewhat shallow . 
  i am not sufficiently informed to have an educated opinion about the specifics of the deal . 
  but for eu 's sake , we better be able to make a deal with a nation the size of canada ( 35m , not that big ) . 
  on other news , brazil 's current president is urging the eu and mercosul to speed up negotiations on a trade deal . 
  http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2016/09/temer-defende-que-mercosul-e-uniao-europeia-acelerem-acordo-comercial.html should we be able to make it , this would be major news for the eu . 
  keep in mind china is pushing for a brics free trade area , and that soon enough britain will also be a competitor .

  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  cristina branco recently released her new album menina . 
  [ single video on youtube ] ( https://youtu.be/q4adg0slwbg ) [ album on spotify ] ( https://open.spotify.com/album/3agnb6pudkurtxygvbzl2v ) i chose to post it here because her fan base seems to quite spread throughout europe . 
  in spotify , the cities with the most listeners for cristina branco are , lisbon , amsterdam , madrid , istanbul , barcelona . 
  not necessarily . 
  note even though i am portuguese , i 'm not his biggest fan in that regard . 
  and i did n't like much of what i heard from him at the peak of the `` invasion '' . 
  however to his credit , he was calling attention to the fact that europe needed to help the closer neighbours of syria with the influx of refugees , or we would end up having to deal with it in our own territory . 
  so had europe listened to him the outcome could have been much better . 
  sorry about that . 
  i did n't because it 's been covered here and it 's a long story , not sure how deep to get into it . 
  but the gist of it is ... 
  the process for the choice for un secretary general has been taking place . 
  it was supposed to be made more transparent this time . 
  candidates have campaigned , and there 's been 5 rounds of votes and a few have quit due to bad results . 
  next round will be decisive . 
  leading is the portuguese antonio guterres . 
  ex prime minister and united nations high commissioner for refugees is leading the race , quite comfortably . 
  expected to win unless russia vetoes him . 
  there has been a string lobby to elect someone from eastern europe and a women . 
  this is defended by germany . 
  bokova , from bulgaria was the candidate representing this lobby , but she did terribly . 
  so now in the very end bulgaria presented a second candidacy by georgieva , supported in particular by germany . 
  georgieva is currently the european commissioner for budget and human resources . 
  this is very controversial for many reasons . 
  firstly it makes a mockery of the supposed transparency and soundness of the process . 
  the current president of portugal , marcelo rebelo de sousa , described it as joining a marathon in the last 100m . 
  since bokova refused to quit there 's 2 candidates from bulgaria . 
  rather odd situation since candidacies are supposed to be presented by countries . 
  while it 's expected for there to be multiple european candidates , this is seen as foul play , and in particular foul play ( in particular ) by germany against portugal who leads . 
  since she 's part of the eu commission it gets even worse because it is to an extent coming across as an eu commission supported candidate . 
  she had her candidacy facilitated by the commission ( unpaid leave ) at a critical time when she 's working on the budget , and there have been people from the commission making statements about her . 
   relocation efforts which were decided on by majority voting using a clause specifically agreed upon in the eu treaties for a refugee crisis . 
  so where 's the problem ? 
  you 're having that discussion with someone else , not me . 
  i intervened to show your version of the story was complete bullshit . 
  merkel and germany did ( as did the european commission ) consistently criticised hungary for closing borders . 
  in fact they did more than that . 
  hungary was even criticised for its efforts to register migrants ( given most do not want to register ) . 
  http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-13/austria-likens-hungary-asylum-seeker-policy-to-nazi-era/6771418 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34142512 so , the point is , with regards to the story of this post , attempts to impose controls to this chaotic `` invasion '' of migrants were constantly and viciously attacked by some . 
  -- with regards to the sanctions aspect , which i do n't have the time nor will to discuss , it 's not as straightforward ( not even close ) to how you put it . 
  it 's a matter of sovereignty . 
  you ca n't impose any and all rules by qualified majority . 
  evidence is that the proposed sanctions , were never even actual sanctions , but de facto sanctions . 
  loopholes used to hit back at those members . 
  it 's really not clear ( at all ) that such quota policies can be imposed on member states by the council . 
  in any case quotas are a digression that have nothing to do with the original topic . 
  are you serious ? 
  that 's your answer to the fact that you just made up a load of bullshit ? 
  regarding sanctions , this is what i remember . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/senior-german-meps-threaten-to-cut-eu-money-to-poland-hungary-ingeborg-grassle-alexander-graf-lambsdorff-budgetary-control/  poland and hungary , among other countries , could be sanctioned financially for refusing to comply with eu values or rules on migration relocation , two influential members of european parliament told die welt . 
  ...  `` countries that do n't respect eu laws , or countries that do n't participate enough in the resettlement of migrants or the registration of refugees , should be deprived of funds . '' these more explicit threats , as i recall , came later in the game . 
  during relocation efforts . 
  holy shit . 
  how can you make up such bullshit . 
  thankfully it 's easy to refresh people 's memory these days http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11919548/angela-merkel-attacks-east-european-leaders-for-ignoring-their-past-over-refugees.html  calling upon her own experience of growing up in communist east germany , mrs merkel criticised leaders including viktor orban , the hungarian prime minister , for building new fences in europe despite having escaped their own isolation at the end of the cold war . 
  ...  although mrs merkel did not mention mr orban , her remarks were ** a clear reference to the fence hungary has built along its southern border to keep refugees out . 
  ** http://dw.com/en/merkels-spokesman-closing-borders-to-migrants-not-sustainable/a-18723852  merkel 's spokesman : ` closing borders to migrants not sustainable '  germany has slammed hungary for closing borders to refugees,

  no one is bound by the referendum . 
  it 's not binding . 
  merely advisory . 
   why should a nation 's individual regions be allowed to veto nationwide referenda ? 
  firstly , the referendum is n't binding . 
  it 's merely advisory . 
  so this has nothing to do with a veto of the referendum . 
  the referendum has no legal consequence , only political . 
  secondly , scotland is n't just a region but a country . 
  and being a country it has significant autonomy , and can not be forced by westminster to do whatever it wants .
