  every person is multiple things at the same time . 
  but the stronger is the bond that unites you , compared to that which separates you , the more likely you are to avoid conflict . 
  in the end patriotism serves the purpose of stability . 
  it creates a common bond that helps prevent an internal conflict . 
  without that bond what you will just have multiple `` tribes '' with a much higher potential for disputes among them . 
  you can see this all too often in many other countries where the sense of patriotism is weak and sense of identity is mostly based on other traits . 
  and this is why developing an european identity ( not necessarily instead but ) on top of our national identity is so important and was defined as a major project after wwii ( even though some people often forget what the major goal is and why ) . 
  and this is also why it is so dangerous to create a society where much of your citizens do not identify nor establish any kind of bond to their host nation ( nor supra nation ) , as we appear to be doing in europe to an extent . 
  of course exacerbated patriotism can be used for bad . 
  it can blind us to one 's wrong doings , and make us stuck together when we should n't . 
  but the lesson should n't be we should avoid it altogether , or keep the state away from it . 
  the lesson should be that it is too fundamental a part of society to be neglected . 
  we must prevent it to be hijacked , by those inside or outside , and we must prevent it from being broken apart . 
  instead it must be kept functional and healthy at all times , and it is our responsibility to do so . 
  -- and do n't get me wrong , i get your perspective . 
  but subjectivity and relativity does n't make it stupid . 
  those are inherent characteristics of a social world . 
  i too can understand it . 
  that said , regarding struggling with portuguese , that seems a bit extreme . 
  i 've had some years living in the uk when i 'd rarely speak portuguese . 
  and indeed i 've caught myself making dumb mistakes at times , or just a bit slower in the first days when back in portugal ... 
  but i would n't necessarily call it struggling . 
  also , i know speaking is different from just hearing or reading . 
  but you could always watch some portuguese tv , listen to portuguese music ( [ here ] ( https://reddit.com/r/somluso/ ) and [ here ] ( https://reddit.com/r/musicanova/ ) , shameless plugs i know :p ) , read portuguese news , or write in portuguese subreddits . 
  even a bit here and there makes a difference .

  apparently you did n't understand what i did say . 
  here 's an hint to make conversations work . 
  instead of just throwing a supposed counter example to what i said , explain your point explicitly referring to what i said , and the point i was making , and what you 're presenting . 
  because the only way this is going to make any sense is if you completely distort my point . 
  you 're making no sense . 
  that example you gave does n't even have anything to do with following the letter of the law and not the spirit . 
  that example is precisely one of a normal asylum . 
  that 's how it works . 
  anyway i made my point already . 
  nope , that 's sending them home after war . 
  not invoking dublin to send them to another european country . 
  that 's an instance where germany provided them with asylum . 
  this post is about the possibility of germany passing that responsibility to another european country . 
   and they behaved like not having any care in the world . 
  indeed , in particular they did n't invoke dublin to send people back to other european countries . 
  which should hint you that it was a completely different situation . 
  `` completely different '' being quite an understatement . 
  so now the german government cares about dublin ?

   i am slightly irritated that the article prominently features the photo of a kid who is visibly 4-5 year old , while the article is on children who ** claim to be ** 14-17 year old . 
  many of which who are probably 18-28 years old . 
    the bka said it was hard to keep tally as many migrants arrived with no identity papers  people give their name , name is written differently in different situations . 
  one child becomes two . 
  they also make up whatever age they want , so in some cases it 's more like zero children become two . 
  my bad , i misunderstood that dialog , and interpreted that * `` we '' * as referring to the general public . 
  this is a useless discussion , because you do n't really care if your arguments meet your own standards . 
  the problem in your statement should be obvious for someone who just threw `` religious freedom '' so lightly . 
  it 's not a religion if it 's not accepted . 
  acceptance is not an inherent characteristic the group , but others attitudes towards them . 
  then a way to discriminate a religious group is to make the ( rather subjective ) socio-political choice of not accepting that religious group as a religion . 
  that is , discrimination justifies itself . 
  it 's not discrimination if they 're small enough and we do n't like them enough , so we can just say fuck you religious group we do n't accept you as a religion . 
  it 's not discrimination if we chose to discriminate . 
  note i 'm not arguing for scientology . 
  i 'm glad it was stopped in the netherlands . 
  unlike say in portugal my home country ... where it is a religion . 
  see how it works ? 
  my point is nothing is as simplistic as you put it . 
  religious freedom ca n't be a tag you can use to protect nefarious intentions , and subjectivity is inherent to many if not most laws , be it on their definition or interpretation . 
  says who ? 
  you see , it 's considered a religion in many countries . 
  many in europe . 
  suddenly subjectivity and slippery slopes are n't a problem . 
  also it 's quite an ironic answer given the dictionary definition of cult . 
  and i quote : * a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or dangerous * http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cult a definition that itself makes your statement nonsensical as cult implies a religious group . 
  i do n't agree with his proposals but that 's nonsensical . 
  first it 's not muslims we do n't like , but those who are radicalised . 
  second indeed that 's the old problem of tolerance with intolerance , it does n't work . 
  your laws and institutions are part of an ecosystem . 
  they evolved with your society . 
  and it is expected that a sudden introduction of a foreign agent may disrupt that `` environmental balance '' . 
  you however are taking the dogmatic stance that there a magic recipe that works better for everyone in every situation . 
  there needs to be a balance . 
  we should see our values as an ideal to pursue . 
  at the same time we need to be playing a winning strategy . 
  achieving a higher standard of respect for human rights is only going to be accomplished if you focus not only on the small but also on the bigger picture . 
  not just the short term but long term effects . 
  otherwise you risk missing the forest for the trees . 
  which is what has been happening in europe . 
  that did n't stop the netherlands from discriminating against those who profess the religion of scientology . 
  he 's definitely crazy . 
  but your points are moot . 
  we could say that about most laws ... who defines x ? 
  who defines hate speech ? 
  who defines what is * aggravated * assault ? 
  who defines what material is 18 + ? 
  etc etc. 
  there are always subjective definitions to be made and possible subjective interpretations of the law . 
  but this fact does n't mean you do nothing for fear of a slippery slope . 
  indeed i would argue we 've gone to far the other end . 
  we allow obvious extremist activists to roam free . 
  shouting things that , in a slightly more primitive society ( i 'm talking a few decades ago ) they would n't dare to , because they 'd get their asses kicked and would wake up in an hospital bed . 
  our ethical evolution ca n't be dogmatic .
