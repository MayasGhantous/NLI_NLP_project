when i said `` we '' i was including galicia . 
  culturally speaking it 's all the same area , even our language is much closer to one another than to castellan/spanish . 
  edit : you should know , i just noticed your flair , 
  we have a somewhat strong celtic cultural presence , especially in the north of the country . 
  this cultural presence extends further up north into galicia where as a mere curiosity vigo 's own football team is called celta de vigo . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_nations ) no celtic language has been spoken here in modern times but i would n't be surprised if a few words managed to find their way into our modern language . 
  this is just incredibly troubling . 
  i know small company that does their business out of greece . 
  nicest guys in that specific machining industry and quite frankly one of the best in the entire world at doing what they do - flawless pieces . 
  i seriously hope they do n't get kicked out of business or worse due to this whole circus . 
  i do n't think a reddit post would end up in any of our news outlets though . 
  i 'd be somewhat surprised if any of the `` big '' outlets even knew what reddit is . 
  maybe i 'm wrong . 
  we have a [ monarchist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_monarchist_party_%28portugal%29 ) . 
  you can somewhat feel how strong monarchism is in portugal if you take a look at our last [ legislative elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2011#results ) in 2011 and how well they fared . 
  wait a minute , i thought decriminalizing drugs was supposed to rampantly increase drug abuse over here . 
  what the hell are we doing wrong ? 
  do you have a flag ? 
  yes , but that sometimes depends if you 're traveling for leisure or business . 
  if you have plenty of time to enjoy yourself and like exploring and finding unexpected things in out of the common path places then satellite navigation is usually not that useful . 
  i have to admit i have n't used it much , every time i used it i was just playing around with it . 
  what i mostly use for navigation is a localized version of [ ndrive ] ( http://www.ndrive.com/ ) ( a local portuguese company , great local maps as a possible consequence ) called [ meo drive ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndrive.androidtmndrive ) that got released through an agreement with local carriers . 
  it comes pre-loaded in some meo/tmn phones but it 's free on the play store if you have another carrier ( i 'm vodafone ) . 
  maps for the whole country and a couple of voices for portugal are free , maps for other countries have to be purchased and live traffic information requires a subscription i believe . 
  since i rarely leave the country it 's the ideal solution for me . 
  edit : recently i 've been trying to use [ waze ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze ) whenever possible and it 's great but you * must * have a data plan and it 's less than ideal for traveling abroad since having no internet access renders it a bit useless . 
  if you know ahead of time the general area where you 'll be you may want to start using the [ offline cache feature ] ( https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/2650377?hl=en ) . 
  it basically saves an area of the map for offline use . 
  lisbon is n't exactly a huge city but the feature can store it in it 's entirety and then a bit more of the suburbus on each side so it may help storing a whole chunk of maps of the surrounding areas whenever you have wifi internet access before you head somewhere . 
  delicatessen is a classic !, 
  i do n't think i 've seen the other two though , thanks for the heads up . 
  this is perfect !, 
  thanks . 
  that explains a lot , i was a bit confused trying to find a connection between the movie and the ad when the connection was in fact between the two actors , 
  i recognize these two from [ rare exports : a christmas tale ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143/ ) , they play father and son in it . 
  i suppose the advertisement is in some way related to the movie ? 
  do they ( the actors ) do more stuff together or was this a one off movie and ad to go with it ? 
  i recently watched both [ trolljegeren ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707 ) and rare exports and though they 're both really cheesy and terrible at times i really enjoyed them . 
  if you know of any more horror/sci fi/fantastic nordic or generally european movies please let me know . 
  other than these two the only other european movies going into this kind of genres that i know of were [ d\u00f8d sn\u00f8 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278340/ ) , [ iron sky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/ ) and [ rec ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/ ) . 
  some guillermo del toro 's movies could be added to the list but they 're a bit more serious and not exactly aiming for the level of cheesiness the others achieve . 
  portuguese , spanish , italians and to some extent romanian if we speak * really * slow and wave our hands up and down a lot we can pretty much figure out what the other is saying . 
  portuguese people sometimes have to mix it up a bit with a brazilian accent or some other tricks because our language is weird and sounds like we 're talking russian when compared to the others . 
  french on the other hand . . you might as well be speaking cantonese to me . 
  all i 'm getting is a pay wall when trying to read the article . 
  any chance of a mirror or copy ? 
  huh ? 
  i can see why it 's harder to understand , portuguese from portugal is a very monotone language . 
  i 've been mistaken as a russian while abroad and talking portuguese with some friends a number of times . 
  came to the conclusion the two languages sound eerily similar for something that could n't be so different . 
  especially the way we pronounce some words with `` ch '' , `` s '' and `` j '' in them . 
  out of curiosity , do you also have issues understanding galician people ? 
  whenever i hear them talk it sounds a lot more like portuguese than traditional spanish/castillan for some reason and most of the time we do n't have to resort to portu\u00f1ol to make ourselves understood . 
  my uncle lived near madrid for some years and everyone thought he was galician because of his accent until he told them he was portuguese . 
  portu\u00f1ol is our way of ending up speaking portuguese just the same but with a few adapted words and not in a such a monotone fashion . 
  it may take some time but we end up understanding each other  i do n't think it 'd be the case if any of us were talking to e.g. 
  a polish or czech guy . 
  you should try listening to romanian , i think you 'll be amazed how easilly you can make out what they 're saying without much effort . 
  got ta love latin derivatives . 
  portuguese , spanish , italian and romanian if no one is speaking it too fast we can all figure out what the other is saying . 
  french is also a derivative but it 's a heck of a lot harder to figure out what they 're saying if you never had lessons . 
  yep , only options i had when in school was mandatory english and optional french/german ( one or the other ) . 
  it 's been a while since i finished school so i have no idea how it is now but i 've never heard of anyone taking spanish classes . 
  i 'd go as far as to say there 'd be no advantage to taking spanish classes since we already understand each other well enough provided no one is speaking too fast . 
  when i visit my relatives in spain we have no issues whatsoever making ourselves understood , they speak in spanish and i speak in portuguese . 
  they 're not even from galicia where their language is closer to portuguese than spanish , they 're all mostly from andaluzia . 
  [ meanwhile in neighbouring portugal . . ] ( http://www.neowin.net/news/file-sharing-copyright-material-considered-legal-in-portugal ), 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  am i wrong when i think of the uk mostly as a services provider ? 
  i ca n't think of any industry where they 'd survive on their own in case of any major conflict . 
  admittedly i 'm not the most knowledgeable person on the subject , could someone maybe shed some light on this ? 
  edit : i do n't mean to be snide , genuinely curious . 
  [ prism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prism_%28surveillance_program%29 ), 
  we have a weird relationship with the spaniards . 
  when paulo futre went to play for atl\u00e9tico madrid their supporters used to call him names because he was portuguese . 
  eventually he made it to team captain and atl\u00e9tico supporters kept on calling him names because he was portuguese . 
  when asked about it they replied they called him names * exactly * because he was portuguese , if he was an english man they would n't call him names ... but he sure as hell would n't be team captain either . 
  that pretty much sums up the kind of relationship we have with them . 
  on the short term , sure . 
  but do n't forget you 'll have to pay back the money you borrow , eventually . 
  if those airports and highways create no revenue at all , where exactly will you get the money to pay the debt ? 
  that was our biggest mistake and what threw portugal into today 's situation . 
  edit : also , it did n't exactly result in more local people being hired . 
  it resulted in cheap workforce being imported by the construction contractors . 
  somewhat large quantities of mostly illegal immigrants in some cases . 
  edit 2 : here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/only-five-thousand-passengers-used-beja-airport-in-two-years/28229 ) . 
  it was clear at the time such a small country would have no need for an airport there ( porto/lisbon/faro airports are perfectly capable of serving the whole country ) , it 's even more clear right now . 
  corruption and terrible politicians went ahead with it , spent millions of euros ... and now the entire population has to pay for it . 
  and here 's the kicker , they wanted to build * another * airport in lisbon before the crisis started to hit us with a stick . 
  and get ready for airports and highways that no one uses or needs . 
   of course , everytime some annointed politicians pretend to do `` good '' and `` in the name of the workers '' this sounds so encouraging . 
  but , unintended consequences are alaways waiting just around the corner . 
  i 'm forced to agree with you on this part , not so much on the first paragraph . 
  working conditions here in portugal are coming closer and closer to modern day slavery greatly due to the austerity measures , and we 're in the eu . 
  from the news reports i 've seen from greece they 've got it even worse . 
  there was a report i saw yesterday where an employer was trying to force employees to sign the documentation stating they had received wages since march ( ! ), 
  when they in fact had n't received anything at all . 
  and it 's not like they were decent wages to start with , 320 $ / month . 
  i do n't even know how are people supposed to be making a living working for no money since march . 
  i do n't get a lot of news from ukraine and i only know a couple of people from there but from what i gather things are n't exactly looking good either .
