  there 's a lot of corruption and subversive lawmaking all throughout europe right now . 
  from local governments all the way up to brussels . 
  the common citizen feels powerless , voting means absolutely zero when it comes to what matters . 
  i understand we should n't compare the day to day of a european citizen to that of a bangladesh inhabitant . 
  but frankly , if we ca n't maintain decent working conditions on our own backyard i do n't know what are we supposed to be doing half way across the world . 
  unemployment is at an all time high in austerity countries , so are suicide and extreme poverty rates . 
  with it come health issues , hospitals are full to the brim . 
  people are losing their houses left and right and it 's not like they were luxury houses like some people like to believe . 
  it 's all a big mess . 
  sometimes i joke by saying i miss the days of old style slavery . 
  slaves were sheltered and fed , nowadays we 're supposed to shelter and feed ourselves . 
  sorry about the wall of text , i started typing and ... yeah . 
  well , at least they 're trying to do something about the issue . 
  let 's hope it 's something that will actually be enforced and not just written on some paper . 
  to be honest i hated english classes while in school . 
  dissecting a language 's grammar has to be one of the circles in dante 's inferno . 
  i had perfect scores in tti ( t\u00e9cnicas de tradu\u00e7\u00e3o de ingl\u00eas / english translation techniques ) since like you i watched a lot of tv and played a lot of videogames and could read and translate it back and forth with ease but english classes themselves were still pretty terrible . 
  i can safely say i learned 100 % how to understand and speak english through tv/movies , videogames and later books . 
  the internet did n't really teach me anything since i only got internet in ~ 2000 when i was already in my twenties . 
  this [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decimal_day ) entry may help . 
  we used to call 1000 escudos ( our currency before the euro ) `` 1 conto '' in portugal . 
  as in 10000 escudos = 10 contos . 
  these days everything is called euro , be it 1 euro or 1000 euro . 
  the following is a quote from terry pratchett and neil gaiman 's book good omens . 
  `` note to young people and americans : one shilling = five pee . 
  it helps to understand the antique finances of the witchfinder army if you know the original british monetary system . 
  two farthings = one ha ` penny . 
  two ha ` pennies = one penny . 
  three pennies = a thrupence bit . 
  two thrupence = a sixpence . 
  two sixpence = one shiling , or bob . 
  one florin and one sixpence = half a crown . 
  four half crowns = ten bob note . 
  two ten bob notes = one pound ( or 240 pennies ) . 
  one pound and one shilling = one guinea . 
  the british resisted decimalized currency for a long time because they thought it was too complicated . '', 
  one of the most hilarious things i ever read , 
  there 's a funny story about one of our football players in the 80 's / 90 's , paulo futre . 
  he went to play for atletico madrid and some time later he became team captain even though atletico supporters called him bad names because he 's portuguese . 
  their justification for it was it 's exactly because he 's portuguese , if he was for example english they would n't call him names . . but he sure as hell would n't be team captain either . 
  i 'm not much of a football fan but i always enjoyed that story , possibly because it very accurately depicts our relationship with spaniards . 
  [ a rare thing for me while on reddit ] ( http://imgur.com/gyo6i3h ) . 
  we have a somewhat old habit of [ telling people to gtfo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viriathus ) , 
  [ wikipedia entry on the anglo-portuguese alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ), 
  fun fact : [ the us almost invaded the azores ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_plan_gray ) . 
  altough not on that article i was told the english disagreed with the invasion due to the ~ ~ [ methuen treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methuen_treaty ) ~ ~ [ anglo-portuguese alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) as old as it was and other arrangements were thus made . 
  edit : anglo-portuguese alliance and not the methuen treaty , got my history mixed there . 
  oops . 
  portugal 's [ drug decriminalization program ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies ) has been running quite well . 
  decriminalization is * not * legalization , keep that in mind . 
  nah , do n't be . 
  it 's still totally irrelevant to what 's being discussed in this post , 
  it 's my username , drizzt and house baenre are both part of the same fantasy world . 
  speaking from my personal perception we mostly had immigrants from the palop ( pa\u00edses africanos de l\u00edngua oficial portuguesa , or african countries with portuguese as official language ) and brazilians up to roughly 20 years ago when there was an somewhat large influx of eastern european , chinese and indian people coming over . 
  some northern european and british settled in the region of alentejo along the coastline more often than not . 
  we also have a fair number of gypsies living all over the country . 
  this [ wiki entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_portugal ) may possibly give you better information . 
  speaking specifically of muslims and portugal - the most predominant religion is [ roman catholic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_portugal ) but we have no state religion and everyone is free to worship whoever/whatever they please . 
  young people seem to not care much about religion at all . 
  we have a long shared history with muslims ever since the [ crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_crusade ) and the [ moors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moors ) . 
  our entire territory was captured from the moors during the crusades and our borders have remained the same ever since . 
  not all moors left , some stayed behind and gathered in places like [ mouraria ] ( http://wikimapia.org/4782047/mouraria ) known in today 's age as the place to go if you want hard to find spices or exotic cooking ingredients from around the world . 
  in time their culture got mixed with that of everyone else 's and eventually defined what it means to be portuguese in today 's day and age . 
  we owe a significant number of things to the moors and muslim culture . 
  from food to cities or region names like the mentioned alentejo as well as the algarve to a whole number of other things . 
  we sometimes say in a jokingly fashion that if something starts with an `` al '' in it 's name it 's of arabic descent . 
  thought they ca n't be compared to the number of catholic churches scattered over the country there are a fair number of [ mosques ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_mosque_of_lisbon ) as well . 
  i must add there are no noticeable clashes between the muslim population and the rest of the population . 
  sorry about the long post , one thing led to another and suddenly a wall of text happened . 
  surprisingly enough i 'm not seeing any of that happen in portugal right now , one would expect it would . 
  you 're right about leonor , our next door neighbours use it too with the exact same spelling . 
  did n't know about clara being used in russia . 
  the word has other uses in portuguese . 
  one roughly translates into `` clear '' and the other is what we call egg whites ( clara de ovos ) . 
  does it have other uses in russia as well ? 
  it is quite popular but it 's not really unique as it 's basically the same as john with the same biblical background . 
  i know a lot of them , 
  portuguese names . 
  male : nuno , gon\u00e7alo , rodrigo , diogo , vasco , tiago , rui , h\u00e9lder , v\u00edtor , f\u00e1bio , ivo female : in\u00eas , elsa , filomena , francisca , leonor , mafalda , clara , soraia , andreia only the most common and current names who have been actively used in the past 30 years or so up to this date to name infants are included . 
  latin based speaking countries are prone to have variations of these names . 
  photoshop ? 
  more like paint . 
  yep , rounding up 1-2 $ is quite common . 
  not more than that though . 
  i do n't think what really matters is being discussed in this thread . 
  this tax will vary according to what kind of media device is in question . 
  apparently at the very least a 0.25 $ tax per gb will be applied . 
  if i want to buy a 2tb hard drive ( prices vary , usually 200 $ ) to store the raw files from pictures i take with my digital camera ( ~ 15mb each ) i will have to pay * at least * an extra 512 $ . 
  almost 3 times the price of the actual item itself will be a single tax . 
  i 'm not even throwing sales taxes into the equation . 
  this is beyond surreal when i 'm not even interested in * anything at all * where they own copyright . 
  most of the `` music '' and `` literature '' made here is absolutely terrible as i 'm sure pretty much every single portuguese can confirm . 
  the only reasoning i can find behind all this is they come up initially with totally outrageous numbers and from there on build a platform to negotiate and get * something * out of it instead of getting what they should , which is zero . 
  tldr : 200 $ hard drive will become 712 $ because of a single tax that basically assumes i pirate terrible music and books that i would n't listen to or read even if gifted to me . 
  it 's the kind of * radicalized * speech `` with us or against us '' the poster above you has that got trump elected in the first place and is causing a bunch of europe to lean to the far right . 
  it saddens me when people do n't realise that . 
  know the feeling . 
  i 'm on mobile and i see uniunea europeana with some diacritics i ca n't reproduce, 
  it 's sort of a running joke but in reality we eat it mostly on special occasions or maybe 2-3 times a month because although delicious it is also somewhat expensive . 
  we have to import it ( mostly from norway ) since there 's none on our waters and that makes an already above average price fish even more pricey .
