  do you think sisters wear that for fun ? 
  [ covering the hair is n't a muslim thing . 
   i also believe one has a right to wear what they choose . 
  so if everyone chooses that wearing nothing is the new way it 's ok ? 
  i 'm covering your face is disrespectful and unsecure . 
  you can wear anything just no reason to cover all your face just because . 
  we had plenty with top10 results that could have won medals . 
  it was not boring just a little underwhelming . 
  the south coast is still atlantic :d, 
  please tell me what portugal has more in common with greece . 
  probably gun usage, 
  really ? 
  the evidence needed is all over the [ internet ] ( http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/cheats ), 
  / r/portugal waits for you, 
  was using this source : http://www.icnf.pt/portal/florestas/dfci/resource/doc/causas-incendios/relatorio-causas-incendios-2003-2013.pdf page 7 they match since they are `` causas apuradas '' . 
  no problem being hispanic but not spanish , 
  there was a study in portugal and between 2003 and 2013 only 2 % of fire were natural . 
  only one link and about `` effects of apparent temperature on daily mortality in lisbon and oporto , portugal '' as i said, 
  i will give you some actual data because you are talking about things that you do n't know . 
  http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/forest+fires+and+burnt+area+%e2%80%93+mainland-1192 [ and here you can see the causes of fires between 2003 and 20013 ] ( http://www.icnf.pt/portal/florestas/dfci/resource/doc/causas-incendios/relatorio-causas-incendios-2003-2013.pdf ) since you probably do n't know portuguese i will put here what is essencial : [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/klza75q.png ) red : intentional , yellow : natural , gray : negligent, 
  `` effects of apparent temperature on daily mortality in lisbon and oporto , portugal '' we are talking about fires, 
  please tell me how will the frequency of fire increase because of the temperature if the great majority has human hand in it . 
  around 1/3 of the fires start at night !, 
  the frequency is what people make it be . 
  yes it 's hot here but it has been this hot since forever . 
  one forest fire is normal . 
  however 200 are not, 
  even portuguese do it in portugal, 
  no euro no money . 
   he is not a woman which might not matter after all . 
  gender should never matter . 
  so when inflaction turns positive again we will have negative deflaction !, 
  genius !, 
  the problem would be the same . 
  i guess his family moved when he was very young . 
  guy behind is a escuteiro ( scout ), 
  in portugal one of the most iconic things you can buy is probably [ galo de barcelos ] ( http://www.portugalissimo.com/271-thickbox_atch/galo-de-barcelos-tradicional-medio.jpg ), 
  madeira or ger\u00eas would be so much better . 
  the natural sugar from fruits it 's very different from processed sugar . 
  the problem is that you may even think that it is good but since there is n't really a good regulation ( at least here in portugal ) you never know if it has too much salt/sugar, 
  [ bread like this ] ( http://www.ahistoria.com.br/wp-content/uploads/a-historia-do-pao-de-forma.jpg ) ( i do n't really know how people say it ) is a good example of it . 
  it 's usually with large amounts of sugar but since it 's bread most people do n't even think about looking up to, 
  but not every product needs to be full of sugar . 
  why does bread or juice needs to be full of sugar ? 
  and what the fuck is `` the catalan people '' no one knows , no one is willing to define that because there is n't even a definition to `` peoples '' . 
  are you going to forget those that were born in catalonia and live in other parts of spain ? 
  are you counting people that were born in other regions and live in catalunia ? 
  catalunia is part of spain for centuries ... 
  clearly you are the one that does n't use the brain . 
  otherwise you would n't have posted without even reading it . 
  clearly you did not read it . 
  read it and use your head . 
  yes but i do n't think it 's a good example because we are indeed small and a net receiver . 
   moreso , if we include the huge economic boom that our independence will create , this will increase even more ( by at least 15.000 m $ or more or less 8 % of our gdp , which is what spain takes from us in taxes every year ) . 
  well i 'm sure that it 's not that simple . 
  you think that spain companies would still be doing business as they do it now in catalunia ? 
  it 's overly simplistic to only talk about those 8 % . 
  you are even talking about being a net countributor so those 8 % would n't even be 8 % . 
  well portugal is one of the smallest economies after eastern countries and it 's a net receiver . 
  portugal is a small country . 
  self-determination of who exatly ? 
  what determines that ? 
  you should read what you posted, 
  please link me where it says that spanish constitution is violating human rights . 
  you did not even read what you linked, 
  feels like you know a lot about spanish constitution and human rights, 
  yeah but mentalities change, 
  no it would not because to get to the point to strict the gun law , mentalities for sure would have changed a lot . 
  do you believe that violence and murder would go down if people had guns ? 
  it 's always easy to say that it 's impossible . 
  who said governments ca n't actually get guns out of people 's hands ? 
  just because some countries ca n't does n't mean everyone ca n't . 
  just because you have a strick gun law does n't mean people do n't actually have guns . 
  you have to enforce the law and mexico is n't really good with it otherwise they would n't have [ 3/4 of usa 's firearm-related death rate . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ), 
  are you really comparing mexico and germany ? 
  at least an inoffensive commie :d, 
  that must not have anything to do with the difference in gun control ... 
  no , they have to follow the law they ca n't do whatever they want . 
  just because you do n't support erdogan and hate islam , does n't make your statements correct, 
  [ banana da madeira :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpxie1mfvzy ), 
  yeah i see brazilians almost everyday and have many friends with brazilian roots not so much the others . 
  i bet that in lisbon is different but still . . 
  not everyone needs to work to not feel bored . 
  [ oh yeah ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/qblpo5k67esup4wvcjhgojoafb0and0exkoxok2xn1c.jpg?w=413&amp;s=9d72324370124ce712fd8d5bca44072d ) , [ let them come ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/evr.png ) . 
  [ we know what to do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_the_fearless#/media/file:geraldogeraldessempavor.jpg ), 
  mamma mia here we go again, 
  do you have any statistic to back that up ? 
  edit : http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/statistics/2014/erasmus-receiving-institutions_en.pdf lisbon gets more studens but not most of them . 
  yes , most likely . 
  i do n't even think that both us and eu want single market between the two . 
  i would say that eu as whole is a big market that google needs . 
  well i do n't think that there is anyone that is not interested in wages . 
  the question is if the next upgrade is worth or not . 
  not everyone puts money ahead of family and friends, 
  lol . 
  yeah because it 's france we know that, 
  you were defending that we should just accept it . 
  people will not accept it and will remember it in the future . 
  edit : just so you know portuguese deficit was 2.8 if were not the banks so that deficit will not be there next year .
