  what i mean by this is not paying bills to some providers creating debt that does n't count to that year 's deficit . 
  unfortunately it 's something that happens here and is happening here with the new government . 
  that 's why we had so many problems after getting bailed out , there were so many hidden debts that was ridiculous . 
  i did not said that ... 
  that has nothing to do with what we are discussing . 
  who would win with a default ? 
  no one , specially not people and banks from germany and france ( for the most part ) . 
  saying that loaning at 5 % when you get it lower and is in your interest that the other country comes out of the hole he is , is charity for me is demagogy . 
  see , i 'm not even complaining . 
  just stated that there were no transfer of wealth or any kind of charity because those loans were payed with high interest . 
  i just do n't consider lending with high interest charity , that 's all . 
  charity would be lending with something like 1 % or no interest at all and not 5 % . 
  no it is n't because countries had interest in , for example portugal , not defaulting . 
  if portugal defaulted yeah we would be fucked but so it would be eurozone . 
  people always use the same seed when they random that 's why it 's always lisbon and porto . 
  i want nothing , you called transfer of wealth and i stated the truth . 
  i 'm sorry if i do n't consider a loan with high interest some kind of charity . 
  sorry but money was lent with pretty high interest for something called a transfer of wealth . 
  euro bonds are n't only for greece . 
   well a good chunk of countries have simply not tried . 
  what do you really mean by that ? 
  you saying that all those austerity measures is n't trying ? 
  is this trying equal as loaning to countries at 4 % when you get it at < 1 % ? 
  yeah it 's our debt and our responsibility but the same way this surplus is germany 's responsibility . 
  what does uk has to do with eurozone ? 
  do n't you even know what eurozone means ? 
  the man monkey did n't answer you , i wonder why, 
  i may have a surprise for you ... those women were n't really women , maybe you are wrongly accustomed . 
  i do n't know what kind of math you are doing but 14469/85500 is around 16,9 % and data is from 2015 , as recent as it can get since we are in january of 2017 . 
  portugal is around 17 % at the moment .

  good news but it 's still pretty high around here , let 's hope it continues to go down . 
  `` only '' reason, 
  well that would make me happy too since that would mean they are really committed with something good for environment . 
  europe will continue to push for renewable and always, 
  [ do i believe you or actual data ? 
  i guess i will go with actual data . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gdp-and-beyond/quality-of-life/average-number-of-usual-weekly-hours-of-work-in-main-job ) never the less , i think you missed the point of the graphic . 
  data that i could find goes to [ salaries being almost equal in greece an estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) and [ estonia actually having better gdp per capita than greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  with that data that you provided , prices are usually 10-15 points higher in food and household stuff . 
  so in the end statistics actually go with that greece being more expensive to live than estonia . 
  so in your opinion a country that is mostly cet -2 should be cet just because of business ? 
  no thank you !, 
  i already wake up at 7 and is completely dark , now imagine waiting almost 3 hours to see some light . 
  having sunrise at 10am is not funny and you can talk about nordic countries but we are not nordic . 
   marriage is a great achievement but laws to make illegal for a company to fire someone due to their sexual orientation are very important . 
  at least in portugal you ca n't fire without a `` just cause '' so there really is n't needed any special law in that regard . 
  i 'm sorry apple but in europe consumers have rights , 
  and even after 16years of slow growth they are the 4th eu 's economy with a gpd per capita pairing with eu 's mean . 
  you can be another disaster prophet as much as you want but you ca n't deny truth . 
  still with many many austerity measures and a economy that is changing from low pay industry to high tech we are growing at eu 's speed . 
  the fact that is starting to going down as a % of gdp , you call italy weak economy and say that portugal had high debt before joing euro means that you know nothing about what you are talking about . 
  just because they have high debts now , does n't mean they had when they joined euro . 
  the difference is the point where you start counting and i 'm not confusing anything . 
  even if / u/orofini 's values are not right his point is very important as 2015 as the link i provided shows it . 
  a country can have grow more but if the population is growing too , is it getting really getting better for the individual ? 
  how can you conclude that , percentage differences are so slim .

  you 're just jealous, 
  would n't call him smart but opportunistic, 
  because your first post is like `` you are weak , bear with it ! '', 
  when you actually were trying to say to adapt our behaviors to this weather which is reasonable . 
  i prefer to believe actual studies, 
  oh , i see what you mean . 
  i actually read us as united states so that 's why i thought it was strange . 
  why would usa and portugal share a similar perception on the eu ? 
  it 's kinda interesting that we ( pt and es ) have such a different view in this matter . 
  why would we ? 
  or you were being ironic ? 
  as i said the only shit here is you . 
  did you create that account just to try to shit on portugal ? 
  go to bed and let the big boys discuss in peace . 
  the only shitty thing here is you . 
  people are actually trying to have a conversation here . 
  as the title says this is n't just a group this is a powerhouse to lead reforms that will not take into account many countries opinions and , at the same time , will limit how eurozone/eu can progress while taking everyone opinion . 
  imagine that you create a group with the four bigger economies in euro , create guidelines to follow and then `` anyone can join '' . 
  that 's cannibalizing the opinion of every smaller country because now , suddenly , eurozone has already a group doing something in group without taking everyone 's opinion . 
  how would you feel if now there was a group of countries composed of everyone except france and germany pushing for something that germany does n't want ? 
  they tell you that `` you do n't need to join '' or `` you join if you want '' but will keep developing `` their '' eurozone without taking your opinion into account ? 
  that 's wrong and will undermine eu/eurozone . 
  a good way to cannibalize every smaller country .

  i would say that healthcare is an issue . 
  you may think it is not because that 's the reality you live in but , for people that actually have national health service , it is . 
  besides , having national health service makes private health cheaper . 
   obviously germany have a mitigating factor of strong social programs , but that still does n't make up for the fact that even the poor in the usa live much better than the middle class or even the rich in other countries . 
  have you lived in europe before ? 
  i really do n't think this is true . 
  but imagine the feeling of being able to spend 100k $ in medical bills . 
  that 's the way bro !, 
  you seem to be the common portuguese that the only thing he knows is to talk bad about his country . 
   . . portugal all have vestigial colonies too . 
  care to explain ? 
   however , no one would deny that humans have fundamental rights to liberty ( free movement or political participation ) revoked for conviction of a serious crime .
