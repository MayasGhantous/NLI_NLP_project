hey russia we are so fucking west it 's not even funny please dont come here again, 
  pula means jump in portuguese , mostly used in brazil, 
  yes . 
  at pico and serra da estrela, 
  so theres a game called shadow of mordor that is 34gb . 
  it 's on steam . 
  not ` stolen ' and it would still be 17 $ to just download, 
  what about portugal ? 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/europe_belief_in_god.png/1024px-europe_belief_in_god.png ), 
  all of it, 
  when you compare to to the rest of europe then it 's expensive . 
  whats the avg salary in your country ? 
  i really do n't know how i would feel without sun ... 
  i like riding without a shirt on in the summer . 
  http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=portugal&amp;city=lisbon . 
  avg salary in lisbon is 900 $ . 
  it 's not worth living in portugal , at least in my point of view . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  tuition is expensive as fuck ( 1k $ / year ) and when you do get a job , you get the bullshit salary of 700 $ a month . 
  i think thats one of the good thing around here . 
  no one gives a shit about us because we dont have nukes, 
  we have starbucks and they dont like us :(, 
  seriously i wutted when i saw that . 
  and i live in leiria . 
  the only thing i like around here is the motorcycle meetups . 
  yeah we call you that, 
  well it 's 18 + here for spirits but people mostly dont give a fuck about that . 
  they just ask you if you 're 18 and dont even ask for an id, 
  snows that thing that happens sometimes in serra da estrela, 
  18yo to drink beer ? 
  in what kind of facist country do you live in ? 
  is be too, 
  is n't that the mountain from got ? 
  what am i going to do ? 
  live on 700 $ a month ? 
  it 's miserable, 
  aw we 're the only ones who put the registration date on license plates . 
  i know right ? 
  tfw fuck i hope i move out of this country, 
  yep , we shipped massive pallets of car parts to auto europa ( the factory near lisbon ) where they assemble the cars . 
  foot soldiers are n't everything . 
  you have a very week air force . 
  we only have 30k foot soldiers , but we have 6k pilots and 113 air craft . 
  we have 30 fighters ( 36 if you count the dornier alpha jet ) . 
  not just for vw , but i worked at a medium sized plastic factory that made parts for lamborghni . 
  of course our main export was still vw . 
  what the fuck ? 
  seriously ? 
  u wot m8, 
  yes ultra nationalists with buks, 
  holy shit, 
  you too m80, 
  i hope i move out because 500 $ a month is very little for anyone to live out of . 
  the only thing i would miss ( i imagine ) is portuguese bikes ... 
  i love my macal/casal/famel, 
  avg salary is 700 $, 
  [ people confirming that they have the same issue ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/2c8uzl/algu%c3%a9m_tem_notado_lentid%c3%a3o_do_imgur_nos_%c3%baltimos/ ) [ my own results ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpsint2fxfw ),

  when we owned half the fucking world, 
  its impossible to predict russia atm, 
  what does eastern europe have to do with portugal ? 
  we have decent armies . 
  portugal as a really small numbers in terms of foot soliders . 
  but we do have a strong air force . 
  [ just near where i live , there 's a base with 2 squadrons of f-16s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monte_real_air_base ) also you guys have a military base in portugal . 
  [ lajes field ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) . 
  you were scared we would help hitler so you set camp near us . 
  portugal lol . . its in my flair, 
  we have loads of guns here . 
  24 per 100 people, 
  not the best dish , but the best fast food dish , [ francesinha ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wz3d4b7vips/ufjys6wufui/aaaaaaaabrg/48l9ltjukcg/s1600/10.1288859862.francesinha.jpeg ), 
  theres gas in north africa that 's where portugal and spain get it . 
  a-at least we 're above greece right guys ? 
  if this is not okay then why is it okay to take down a fucking airplane full of civilians you mad twit ? 
  expensive as fuck here , we dont have oil . 
  you do know people do n't pay tens of thousands to get a degree in sweden right ? 
  you have a very narrow view of religion did you forget to tip your fedora ? 
  if in portugal , spain or greece move out, 
  and us . . 22 billion dollar company , 20,188.03 usd gdp per capita, 
   to be fair , he also exercised every day first fucking sentence . 
  well we have a avg salary of 700, 
  best goalie because of 1 game, 
  we do not talk about that wc ... it was a disgrace ... the fouls , the ref ball , fucking south korea ... it was insane, 
  i 'm enjoying a 15 week summer break . 
  i love it . 
  my ac is trailing trough the woods . 
  lol i go to school and i have a 9 to 5 period , 20 minutes of brake in the morning and afternoon and 1.5 h of launch break . 
  we get 3 months in summer , 2.5 weeks in christmas and 2 weeks in easter . 
  well the first day of summer here in portugal there was rain and thunder . 
  and now it 's sunny as fuck even at 7am . 
  i like it . 
  i wont have to pay debts if we could still have our decriminalization of drugs then i would be happy too, 
  i turned off the game after your 2nd goal . 
  i was suprised to see portugal score at the last minute when i googled the score . 
  / r/murica is far from satirical .
