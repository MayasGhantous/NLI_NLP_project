  going to war with colonies, 
  but we have hot as fuck summer and britbongs love that . 
  even today 35c outside . 
  also if we eliminate spain all the tourist money will come to us . 
  old british fucks will come to our country instead of spain, 
  honestly who likes france, 
  natural enemy . 
  also tried to conquer us, 
  your predictions are god awful . 
  might as well burn your portuguese citizenship now . 
  but you also made fatal bazooka which i am eternally grateful for, 
  think of all the submarines we could have, 
  i 'm sure none of those would mind having their colonies back . 
  can you think of all the diamonds in africa ? 
  portugal has around 80 % catholics and still has same sex marriage .

  faro is a hotspot for tourists . 
  tourists are the perfect target to rob and sometimes it goes wrong . 
  hello / pol / how you doing today ? 
  no give me half the world and give spain the other half, 
  actually the user base is 46 % american , so not the majority, 
  this guy is probably a / pol / troll, 
   why does portugal speak portuguese .

  hopefully they will go down in price . 
  ( probably not , their mk4s after all _, 
  will a shrink ray work ? 
  16k minimum for mk4 . 
  at least online . 
  i have seen mk4 for 10k in other countries autoshops . 
  that was just an example . 
  i could buy it somewhere else . 
   why is portugal a country ouch, 
  and you guys win in the youth unemployment rates , so you 're almost the best in that situation too . 
  great scott !, 
  the time machine worked . 
  we managed to get an individual from the 1970 's to 2014 !,

  it 's so good . 
  what about portugal ? 
  forgot us now ? 
  because it 's `` denunciar '' in portuguese . 
  oh you have n't seen a thing . 
  it 's the same bullshit that happened back in 2010 . 
  but most people who actually state their opinion ( about gay marriage ) in person are n't against gay marriage . 
  this is a small percentage of the population speaking very loud ( on the internet ) . 
  only now ? 
  in portugal we 've had fiber for a while . 
  and 53 $ 100mb/s down and 12mb/s up + hdtv and phone .

  one thing i can say about drivers in portugal is that they always warn you if there are cops nearby, 
  you honestly believe that / r/fatpeoplehate is n't a hate sub ? 
  you think it 's something deeper and with more meaning than hate ? 
  get over your opinion and take a good hard look at that shit hole, 
  [ / r/fatpeople ** hate ** ] ( http://reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate ), 
   / r/fatpeoplehate  hur dur its not bout hate, 
  no it doesnt, 
  why would you speak like that ? 
  i sadly think that isnt an unpopular opinion anymore, 
  it 's still that here, 
  holy shit it costs 4 $ to 5 $ here .
