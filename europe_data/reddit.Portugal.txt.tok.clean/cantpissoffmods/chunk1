[ porto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=porto+sentido ), 
  in iraq they bombed the place to the ground , signed all oil contracts possible and left them to fend for themselves before the region was stable . 
  but yay for freedom , shitload of people died after the region was completely fucked up . 
  you just made me imagine a sniper rifle proportional to take out a nuke . 
  one of the japanese battleships , the [ yamato ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/yamato_ ( navio ) ) had 460mm cannons . 
  nice name , i simply have no answer for your name . 
  well , if the war does happen , we will be back to bow and arrow . 
  no one ever tried . 
  maybe it works . 
  well we do have algarve . 
  maybe they will spare us for a nice place for vacations . 
  i would hope for that . 
  but humanity has shown us over the years that wars will always happen . 
  no matter what . 
  good for you , more guns for me . 
  from portugal to russia is long way , but not a bad idea . 
  im portuguese , the nukes probably wont come here . 
  but i may get redrafted , and id rather be with a gun in my hand than hiding in a hole if the shit hits the fan . 
  shit , i really need to step up my work outs . 
  have to be fit for when the war starts . 
  that was unfair ... 
  not american , portuguese . 
  i said that because most countries wouldnt pass the opportunity for a major sports event , to make some money . 
  they actually listened to what the people had to say and refused to do it . 
  even though my tone sounded sarcastic , i wasnt being sarcastic . 
  now having said that , i dont have to bet anything to know you are stupid . 
  only a stupid person would assume all americans are stupid and illiterate . 
  is norway on this planet ? 
  they seem like they are on a diferent planet . 
  i got ta move there . 
  portugal, 
  they need nukes for that . 
  can someone explain to them that the uk is scared of losing scotland because of the oil ? 
  makes me think that the usa might propose scotland to become the 51st state ... 
  noticed there are 3 billion ppl downtown . 
  im already at piolho . 
  ill be piolho bar in 30 minutes . 
  its one of the usual places to meet in the bar area . 
  or you can tell me where are u headed and ill . eet u there . 
  im gon na be reaally late . 
  are u still in the hostel ? 
  i might be there a little late :p , was held up at a friends house . 
  ill be in your hostel street around 9h20 . 
  if we miss each other , ill head to the bar area . 
  i will be wearing a blue short sleeve shirt and brown shorts . 
  im dark skinned ( i look middle eastern ) and i have a cool looking beard . 
  well not that i know of . 
  but i can go there . 
  that place is near a cool bar area in porto . 
  dunno if you 've been there , its called the galleries . 
  or people from porto refer to it as the galleries . 
  if you need help getting around in porto let me know . 
  awesome city !, 
  hmm , say where . 
  hope its not just the two of us . 
  edit : do you know the street name of your hostel ? 
  im portuguese , but i think it translates roughly into : `` franco , franco , that has a white ass , because his wife washes it with ariel '' [ ariel ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=ariel+detergent&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=yav7u6gneohnyqohsicobq&amp;ved=0cckqsaq&amp;biw=1584&amp;bih=741 ) is a popular clothes washing detergent . 
  the `` pasta with jizz '' picture made me realize that person is going to be admitted on another hospital for eating that . 
  this happens with a few . 
  now imagine when its hundreds ... 
  these people were told incredible things about the countries they `` demand '' passage to . 
  when they arrive there and see its not heaven , shit is gon na get real . 
  i gladly welcome anyone in my country that wants to start fresh and feel safe . 
  i dont know how many of them just want a safe place to live . 
  i would say , like u/jocamar said earlier , `` mitra '' or `` guna '' . 
  the word `` mitra '' refers to a shanty town of porto , bairro da mitra , that was demolished more than 10 years ago . 
  im not aware of the etimology of the word `` guna '' . 
  not to be compared with `` ressaca '' or `` carocho '' . 
  those are words used for junkies , the first one more commonly used in the north and the second one more commonly used in the south . 
  2 down , 99998 to go . 
  hope they think the same about portugal . 
  assuming they know where it is . 
  its sad to think that usually missing people in crashes are likely to be dead . 
  quite normal i guess . 
  they need to please the rest of europe . 
  in portugal , its `` arroba '' . 
  yay , we 're top of the list in something . 
  trying to increase birth rate ? 
  someone is preparing for war ... 
  a picture usually helps . 
  but in case you dont have one ill guess . 
  its from spain !, 
  when i read it , it was reported like that . 
  i read somewere here on reddit that of the arrests made in the demonstrations , none were greek nationals . 
  im wondering if the fires are related . 
  thats what austerity brings . 
  people ca n't afford to have kids . 
  everything is funny when you 're on top . 
  i dont think we will be hearing about those isil guys for a while . 
  the russians will use them as target practice . 
  the lead investigator that wrote a book on the events said that the most likely scenario was the kid woke up in the middle of the night , tried to see through the window while balancing on a couch , fell down and broke her neck . 
  parents hid the body and started blaming everyone . 
  any info on the identity of the people ? 
  i have several dutch friends and im a bit worried . 
  well those three countries suffered first hand the destruction , death and suffering of armed conflict . 
  its normal to want to avoid that . 
  i think its possible . 
  real islam is not those morons from isil , that are using a religion as a pretext to indoctrinate people and slaughter/torture/rape innocent people . 
  portugal also created some 2.50 euro coins during the 2008 beijing olympics . 
  so the problem here is france getting butthurt right ?
