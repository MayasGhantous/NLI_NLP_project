  the names of the islands are `` deserted '' and `` wild '' no one lives there and they are essencially nature preserves . 
  portugal has a few islands we are n't using . 
  sure there 's nothing there in terms of infrastructure , but they 'll do in a pinch . 
  the esa is still using it , fortunantly . 
  unless you want them to start strapping these people to rockets . 
  looks like a bunch of cargo containers . 
  you stole that just like you stole the guyanna . 
  the dutch never change , filthy swamp germans * shakes fist *, 
  in the grim darkness of the far north , there is only metal .

  [ of course they did !, 
  salazar helped the axis with raw materials when the axis was winning and started supporting the allies when the allies were wining . 
  he was playing both sides to portugal 's benefit and to maintain our neutrality at all costs . 
  this is not true . 
  portugal and spain fought before and portugal thoroughly destroyed the evil spaniards every single time . 
  till they got the message . 
  edit : fixed link, 
  the social-democrat party in portugal only has that name because they wanted to appear more left-wing after the end of the right-wing dictatorship ( where right-wing = fascism ) . 
  they have allways been a conservative party . 
  the socialist party is also not socialist . 
  they are more social-democrat than anything else .

   brazilians speak portuguese this is as true as belgium being a country . 
  we are destined to do this forever . 
  the way that density map looks probably has n't changed in 4000 years for egypt . 
  ceasing to be a country is a pretty drastic step . 
  the uncivilized celt criticizing other people 's cultures . 
   welsh . 
  bahahahahahahahahahahahaha, 
   ~ ~ dutch ~ ~ swamp germans and ~ ~ english ~ ~ island germans are linguistic buddies !, 
  i hope the relationship is made clearer . 
  1453 never forget . 
  it was n't untill i started playing the europa universallis games that i learned that this war even happened . 
  it speaks volumes about how limited in scope is the teaching of history in portugal . 
  speaking of eu games , the catholics being blue made me feel ill . 
  let 's not forget being a country . 
   * the andorran ftfy, 
   unpronounceable gibberish  better, 
  does n't mean we should do it again . 
  we ca n't and should n't have laws regulating what the media can say . 
  but there should be regulation on how much media can be owned by a single individual/group . 
  that 's exactly how it works in portugal . 
  parties enforce voting discipline on their mps . 
  such a referendum would be unconstitutional in portugal . 
  our constitution prohibits bringing portugal 's international obligations to a referendum . 
   portugal  healthy and prosperous this is absolutely not true . 
  it 's ok belgium . 
  there 's only so much room for non-countries in this tournament < 3 . 
  more like ounceland now . 
  because you are old as fuck and senile , m\u00e1rio . 
  that makes things worse . 
  you can make people vote but you ca n't make them care .

  please turn in your citizen card to the nearest police officer at once , you traitor . 
  foda-se is actually fuck it , when translating literally . 
  sounds like a junta waiting to happen . 
  i wonder what would have happened if scheer had decided that was it and did go all in . 
  looking at the numbers of ships each side had it would have taken several miracles for the germans to win within taking major losses themselves . 
  that giant buttplug does n't help . 
  a median salary would be a better indicator of reality , not just in portugal but for the other countries as well . 
  even more than calling them swedes ? 
  i believe the real reason is lack of funds . 
  i choose to believe we came to our senses and wanted to skip being embarassed this year . 
  we are n't . 
  we had to stop embarassing ourselves for a year . 
  we apologise for the inconvenience . 
  you are correct .

  yeah !, 
  the whores and green wine do n't pay themselves . 
  it 's real . 
  take it from boris . 
  there 's no one to dispute . 
  even in their wildest dreams spain could not produce an individual of such great caliber as to be considered portuguese . 
  neither portugal nor spain existed in viriato 's time . 
  ** triggered **, 
  [ heresy !, 
  not everywhere . 
  the french flag is a definite improvement . 
  * triggered *, 
  that flag wounds me on a deep emotional level . 
  because that social class and many of it 's direct descendents do n't have a decent education . 
   holland way to trigger the swamp germans . 
  there are several companies outsourcing their it divisions to portugal .

  can the german upper house propose it 's own legislation or do they simply review what the lower house sends them ?
