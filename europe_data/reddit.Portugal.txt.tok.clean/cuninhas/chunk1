  new batch . 
  it has actually been kind of cool here for the past weeks, 
  we 'll take tech nerds , all the other can stay in frisco . 
  that 's actually hilarious . 
  you 're 2 people ? 
  you lost me half way through ... 
  maybe their best really is that shitty . 
  now why would you think that ? 
  is portugal a tardigrade ? 
   students call teachers with strong disciplinary tenancies as hitler too this happened here in my youth also . 
  not even cyprus , let alone europe . 
  biology do n't real , shitlord !, 
  comparing vis\u00e3o with the daily mail is dishonest on many fronts . 
  if anything the portuguese version of the dm would be `` correio da manh\u00e3 '', 
  make turku the capital for good measure . 
  65 % of portuguese support life imprisonment . 
  who is that `` we '' ? 
  i 'm portuguese and i do n't believe that . 
  stories in it like this are a dime a dozen . 
  usually the workers go through extensive background checks and then something gets outsourced to someone that has none . 
  about 10 years ago some consultant started uploading internal information to the outsource company .

  the guy will suffer . 
   god god this is retarded . 
  maybe , but also very common . 
  the golden rule is always and everywhere : if you find a bug ** keep your fucking mouth shut ** all the authorities are going to hear is hack/hacking . 
  they ca n't understand the details and do n't even want to . 
  they are not rational actors . 
  after finding out all they 'll care is to narcissisticaly save their face and show the public that the hacker was promptly punished . 
  do n't play captain save a hoe . 
  shut up and let them suffer . 
  tldr for what happened ? 
  and then take the ferry to japan . 
  edit : apparently there are none . 
  strange ... or cross the bearing strait and go to america .

   i 've chosen to enjoy this crazy ride until its end , whatever that may be enjoy the decline . 
   why borris is anywhere near this is beyond me when the uk sends people they do n't send their best , they send boris ...

  this one had a more hands on approach ... 
   a year later tchernobyl happened and the governement claimed the radioactive clouds stopped at the border no way !,

  but they are not common . 
  i was there a few months ago and did n't see any of them . 
  `` people '', 
  what a charlatan !, 
   i have thought less about germany since that day . 
  as you should . 
   and terrible choices of leisure time activity . 
  also known as pub . 
  i had no idea ... 
  yes . 
  gauss probably more of a polymath . 
  uk or usa ? 
  is the uk really that bad ? 
  jesus 2.0 , hipster version, 
  the guy that was using proto differential calculus in geometry more than 1000 years before newton . 
  edit : i think you are confusing archimedes with aristotle , regarding the teeth thing . 
   steve jobs compared to newton steve jobs is n't even a nobody . 
  he just does n't exist . 
  not even close . 
  maybe archimedes . 
  they are hot ? 
  they look totally unremarkable to me ... 
  why do you ask ? 
   however the tribes and different villages would often ` have them on ' and just make shit up , sometimes funny stuff this seems to be a constant in anthropology .

  they are very big, 
   how fast is the fire spreading if we could measure in km/hr reports say 120km/h, 
  better that than being burn alive, 
  you whine like they are just pulling things out of their asses . 
  it happened . 
  some people that did that are probably still alive . 
  edit : i should add , by the way i saw germans behaving in riga when i visited , mentioning this is totally warranted . 
  how lithuanian of you .
