it 's more about the mouth with full of red paint ? 
  that looks blood . 
  man the portuguese girl is wtf to me never seen one like that here . 
  looks like an angolan impregnated a kurd . 
  romania looks like a vampire . 
  sounds fitting . 
  that does n't really look like an average portuguese woman . 
  pepe is a dead meme . 
  did they find any ? 
  before morocco it was us who owned those places . 
  will be interesting to see putins reaction to this . 
  i guess both won in the final against the host ? 
  i think portugal and greece are closer to each other than spain . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  ca n't wait to read his piece of literature in the radio . 
  what, 
  portugal would be the kid who had a great life in elementary : great grades and popular among everyone . 
  but now he is just depressed with shitty grades . 
  i am not a right winger . 
  but it is worth pointing that the paper says that there are ` smarter ' people in the fars ( right and left ) . 
  but ultimately says that right wing people tend to be more ` simple ' . 
  great paper by the way i will use it to annoy some friends right now . 
  in the end of the video they killed with a shock i think . 
  i think the shock is the common humane way . 
  but why the boiling alive at the start ? 
  why ? 
  that 's awful . 
  do n't they have more humane ways of killing than being boiled alive ? 
  wait until you actually get elected ,, 
  whats the deal in corsica ? 
  that works too . 
   '' she did refer -- briefly -- to a referendum on eu membership in her closing statement , but not to ditching the euro . '', 
  that 's not that bad . 
  maybe she is starting to see the eu is not the real enemy out there . 
  while we dont consume much out coffees are really strong and should count as 3 coffes per coffe making us top the list . 
  we just do n't have jobs . 
  but we have immigrants from mainly angola , cabo verde and brazil . 
  hahaha that 's true . 
  i do n't think we need to side with anybody we are n't going to war , are we ? 
  ca n't say you guys have n't already tried !, 
  i am ok with this as long as they give us even more money . 
  the original lyrics said :  for the fatherland , fight !, 
  against the ** british ** , march on , march on !, 
  instead of :  for the fatherland , fight !, 
  against the ** cannons ** , march on , march on !, 
  because even though we were allies at the time they were stronger than us and issued an ultimatum demanding that we gave them the territories between angola and mozambique . 
  the hymn was created as patriotic protest to the decision of accepting the demand . 
  low birthrate and net loss in imigration . 
  in a blink of an eye we will have less population than the likes of luxembourg . 
  i am really enjoying hamon . 
  also now i can see why people still vote for fillon he brings security with his words . 
  le pen 's arguments seem like a disc on repeat . 
  macron is doing alright . 
  melechon looks really respectable . 
  yeah i mean just as a start calling portugal euphoric ... 
  when someone writes n\u00e5 !!, 
  with 2 exclamations marks it must be hard guessing what he is saying . 
  they would have to massively decrease their dependence in oil exports . 
  i agree with the austrians . 
  they used to rule portugal as long as we had power in the advisors or parliament ? 
  or something like that . 
  then felipe iii came into power and kicked the portuguese out of those roles , angered the country and lost the battle . 
  funny fact is that when we restored the independence we almost became a merchant republic . 
  why does luxembourg gain so much ? 
  i always thought that she had potential but at the moment she is just encouraging violence exactly the opposite of what she is saying in this video . 
  she just seems out of touch with the reality . 
  would n't porto to horta be farther ? 
  i agree . 
  / r/europe makes me feel genuinely happy . 
  the us is only 27 % ? 
  that was unexpected . 
  [ yeah , portuguese is the best example . 
  a peaceful civil war with no casualties to end the dictatorship also known as carnation revolution . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ), 
  the invader would lose . 
  without us you would n't exist . 
  always wondered what the native americans would be like today if we left them untouched . 
  i heard somewhere that the vegetarian option requires a registration so the schools can change the number of meat meals and vegetarian meals . 
  what conflicts happen in bosnia that dont happen in serbia and albania ? 
  they have a really cool hymn . 
  you should check portugal !, 
  macron gets some fillons as well . 
  paris is still a lovely city . 
  you guys are probably confusing with the portuguese napole\u00e3o boaparte, 
  fair enough , i deleted my comment . 
  but i would argue trump supporters see things that do n't exist . 
  i have a friend who is a trump supporter and says lisbon is being also overrun by muslims and i 've never seen a muslim in lisbon . 
  no , thanks !, 
  do n't forget to stream !, 
  atleast one of you !, 
  some things in the eu need to change and i hope fillon/macron and schulz/merkel have something in mind . 
  i think the main reason they worked together was the general idea that selling the main public companies was a step in the wrong direction to the portuguese in both short and long term . 
  passos coelho was still able to close tap days after the election which i think was a major reason they joined forces . 
  ireland and france are real horndogs . 
  sweden is now considered a capital ? 
  pink map and occupation of portugal after the napeolonic wars come to my mind . 
  kinda of a shitty ally tbf, 
  quite a old video but i am always fascinated by how influential we were . 
  sweden has twice our gdp . 
  we closer in size with greece or ireland .
