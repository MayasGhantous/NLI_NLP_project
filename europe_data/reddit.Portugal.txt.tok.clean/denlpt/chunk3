  disrespect to us . 
  if i understood correctly from / u/fakeandrei . 
  it 's because the proposals were n't convincing enough .

  ( it was around the time of bush 's wars ) [ piruka - se eu n\u00e3o acordar amanh\u00e3 ] ( https://youtu.be/opdlqtomzem ) most recent hit : talks about his hard past with drugs and how he wants his daughter to not live it [ boss ac - que deus ?

  in portugal : not really popular . 
  we are small people so it is never going to take over here . 
  our neighbours spain on the other hand like basketball . 
  either way i think nba is more well known . 
  they still follow eu rules and decisions . 
  they just have deals to get an extra at the exchange of more contribution and lack of representatives . 
  i like paella and tapas . 
  their enchidos/embutidos are very good as well .

  presunto and cheese, 
  liberal -  less control of the government over the economy conservative -  change only the essentials, 
  patriotism has a pretty bad image in portugal due to the years and years of propaganda that our fascist state ` estado novo ' dropped on us . 
  we are only patriotic when our national football team is playing or something like that . 
  they dropped so much that it had the opposite effect and we had an identity crisis in the 80 's where we only liked what was foreign . 
  ex-colonies to portugal . 
  portugal to luxembourg ( new colony ) or france . 
  spain since it his our only neighbor . 
  we are more like brothers but oh well . 
  there will be a lot of referendums . 
  probably an ex-colony .
