  while the basques and catalonians are getting ever more `` emotional '' about this secession business , you guys seem to be mostly keeping your cool ? 
  awesome news !, 
  the whole of europe could do with spring cleaning like this . 
  the problem though is always the propaganda , always . 
  indeed , also , apparently we do n't eat so much at fast food restaurants compared to the rest of europe , oh i wonder why ... 
  meanwhile , we in portugal : - are some of who eat the most meat , very salted overall food , and drink the most out of the coutries west of poland . 
  - also have the least heart attacks per 100.000 people . 
  feels good to be portuguese today . 
  that guy at the back , on the other hand , does n't seem like he has his umbrella ... 
  i like the concept of `` great driving forces '' rather than the `` great national history '' concept , and i think that 's what the op is getting at . 
  though most people in the thread either say it 's completely unfeasible or completely misunderstand the concept for `` learning in depth every single bit of history that ocurred in every single place in europe '' . 
  the estado novo had only one legitimate party , that was its logo , therefore its the only legitimate icon to be associated with them . 
  and , like you said since the cross already predates them by a lot , it will only become an `` symbol '' of the dictatorship if people make it so , but thankfully i think that 's far from happening . 
  good thing too . 
  i 'd say it 's rather wrong . 
  since the estado novo used it in a lot of propaganda but never as a symbol of the regime itself , if you start associating it with the regime immediatly you bastardize it . 
  we should avoid that . 
  to me , i 've always seen the [ logo ] ( http://vouestaraqui.aroucaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/estado-novo-4.jpg ) of the only party as the most appropriate symbol for the regime . 
  it actually surprises me that it is n't used already by right-wing extremists nowadays . 
  the second part of anpas comment is still right though ... its through education that people come to learn about past crimes , and more importantly their meaning . 
  we 're only `` somewhat half mediterranean '' , remember ? 
  but is n't the east side of crimea really close to mainland russia ? 
  should n't there be a bridge there already ? 
  well , i would n't call it exactly a `` shame '' ... :d, 
  both !, 
  and then back to europe . 
  [ pfft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_fukuda_bay ), 
  was n't this that conflict where the chinese garrison fled after being confronted with a black person ? 
  yes , but only ever since a constitution was signed in 1822 were the azores and madeira considered provinces of portugal , called ilhas adjacentes , or `` adjacent islands '' , distinct from colonial dependencies . 
  actually , they do not . 
  the portuguese empire started in 1415 with the conquest of ceuta , madeira was settled in 1425 , and the azores by about 1432 . 
   suebi and visigoth no , the suebi and visigoths merely displaced the ruling elite . 
  or do you by chance see anyone speak gothic ? 
  presumably because salazar saw it as a direct challenge to his authority and feared a diplomatic incident with nazi germany . 
  license plate gives it away as brazil . 
  both of you are wrong . 
  it 's a * sudden shift in government * that fucks things up . 
  that was cringey . 
  but i have a genuine question though , as three small nations close to russia , have you ever considered forming a federation or an alliance or something ? 
  i just think `` homeland '' is a better translation of `` p\u00e1tria '' . 
  sounds less like the third-reich . 
  feels good to be southerner today . 
  frankly , i accept this agenda . 
  i 'd accept an european army anyday instead of getting our arses invaded once more by the spaniards or atlantians out of the sea because `` sovereignty '' . 
  edit : and having a national army did not prevent greece from becoming completely subordinated to germany . 
  for the non-portuguese , pcp is the portuguese communist party and the be is a leftist party , though they say they are eurosceptics just to say that they are , and nobody really takes them too seriously . 
  i presume it also has some to do with how accostumed we are knowing that the us uses the azores as a military base since we do n't see it as a negative thing , on the contrary . 
  but nobody claims he 's spanish ( unless they 're ignorant ) . 
  magellan simply served the spanish crown . 
  pahahah , i just want to see the reaction of the spanish users when they see this . 
   life was safe and comfortable but not glamorous , european portuguese families had businesses like small crafts and shopkeeping . 
  i just wanted to say about this aspect , many saw angola as a much more cosmopolitan place than the metropolis . 
  the pide was n't as present and coca-cola was introduced in angola before portugal for example . 
  there are n't even very certain numbers for their deathcount other than `` more of them died than us '' . 
  yeah , but it serves more as a background to the topic of the dictatorship and why it fell . 
  you have no idea . 
  angola is one of the most corrupt countries in africa . 
  i 'll just add , because you 're british , we see the colonial war a bit differntly than you guys see ww2 for example . 
  i love watching british documentaries and the way you interview vets , over here though , it 's a bit of a problem since veterans as a rule * refuse * to bring up the subject . 
  my dad was drafted but never shipped , but several of his friends were killed or came back severely changed . 
  a friend of mine 's dad went to angola but we have no idea what he did or went through since he never once spoke about it . 
  another friend of mine 's grandfather was sent as a field doctor , well he apparently went briefly insane . 
  it was n't a very humane conflict . 
  basically everyone here has family or knows someone who was drafted to the war but does n't speak much about it . 
  a shame in my opinion . 
  edit : also , my grandma 's neighbour , a killer dude , really helpful guy , i came to know recently that he worked for the friggin pide , but i 'm told never to mention it around him . 
  the problem is , the colonies presented a conundrum to the dictatorship . 
  marcello caetano was a declared supporter of a steady transition of power towards federalization , along with general sp\u00ednola , but they were completely sorrounded by die-hard conservative `` salazarists '' would would have crucified them if they attempted anything of the sort . 
  obviously simply giving autonomy to the provinces under those conditions would mean secession , but otherwise proceeding with the war was completely corroding the regime . 
  a political deadlock . 
  you could have just written that today started the [ portuguese colonial war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) as a whole . 
  i do n't doubt you , maybe it was n't napoleon , but i 'm almost certain i read that somewhere , because of how it stuck with me . 
  did n't one of napoleon 's generals tell him `` it 'd be easier to conquer all of asia than the netherlands '' ? 
  i think you missed the point . 
  yeah , we 're pretty peripheral in relation to europe ... 
  but we 've got a pretty good geo-political position in relation to the rest of the world . 
  yes , the city of elvas ( of which the above fort is part of ) was [ besieged six times by the spanish , unsuccessfuly . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/3pmk25/elvas_fortress_portugal_built_in_1640_it_is_the/ ), 
  [ that is only part of the largest star-fort in the world !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zivcm29.jpg ) ( the fort is up there on the hill ), 
  all i see is depression . 
  also , there 's a reason why you do n't see lime white houses in cold sweden nor log houses in warm portugal . 
  besides , why would we need [ hanseatic houses ? 
  ] ( http://ncultura.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mateus1.jpg ), 
  we do n't see why we should take all the blame . 
  i 'm portuguesian and i 'm finding this all amusing . 
  over 500 years later and they 're still butthurt over it ... we 've accomplished our mission , boys . 
  [ here 's a random malaccan man singing in portuguese while we 're at it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ypkbgjywc ), 
   the malacca conquer was a bust anyways , since the trading routes shifted to another city as well . 
  myth , malacca was one of the most profitable possessions of the portuguese in asia , which is logical when you control the sea like the portuguese did . 
  the portuguese wanted to form a trade partnership with the sultan of malacca , who actually agreed to it , but then his muslim advisers told him to double-cross us . 
  it 's on them . 
  eh , it 's the thought that matters . 
   important to clarify , it 's restoration and formally the independence was never over . 
  officially they were 2 separate kingdoms with the same king ( with different numeration in each kingdom ) . 
  so it 's a celebration of the restoration of the de facto independence , the official one was never lost . 
  we lost foreign relations separate from spain , which lead to war with the dutch . 
  of course the king of spain would tell any portuguese that they were still independent and under a legitimate ruler . 
  all them portuguese colonies * that required being defended * .
