   places like subway , which is a definite step upward in quality in america . 
  subway is quite shit quality in europe . 
  people go there to drink though so it 's understandable . 
  we also have the highest rate of people that abstain entirely from alcohol iirc . 
  this is shocking . 
  this sub has become ridiculous . 
  congratulations on your shitcomment . 
  social liberal is fine . 
  especially / r/europe, 
  can i ask what your flair is ? 
  remove goulash . 
  some of them , but not many . 
  the lib dems were partly formed out of the social democrat party after all . 
  liberalism is less authoritarian than conservatism and socialism though so i do n't think they 'd be very compatible . 
  the uk will be guaranteed tory for the next decade . 
  labour are centre right in a lot of their economic policies . 
  at least they were until now . 
  [ `` british jobs for british workers '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/30/brown-british-jobs-workers ) was said by gordon brown , not the bnp . 
  they also invented tuition fees in the uk and argued for unlimited ones . 
  they 're a bizarre mix of far left corbyn types and people that might as well be tories . 
  never heard of anyone doing a phd not receiving a salary . 
  you earn money when you do a phd . 
  we can vote from anywhere . 
  southern england is part of the hot banana , you 're a half an hour flight from france , belgium , holland , germany and denmark . 
  that 's pretty freaking central . 
  your last phrase is worth noting . 
  faith has been hijacked as a purely religious concept . 
  in actual fact it 's exactly what you say . 
  very right wing afaik . 
  fuck i meant tsv . 
  holy shit that 's hilarious . 
  poland i assume ? 
  we also have many teams per country which makes it even better . 
  you might be confusing them with hsv . 
  it 's not like there are n't any bike lanes in the uk though . 
  that malta 's gdp per capita is n't `` like spain and italy 's '' no matter how you measure it . 
  do n't know where you 're getting your stats from but malta 's gdp ppp per capita is $ 29,000 at latest reading by the imf : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita so more like `` the same as the czech republic 's '' . 
   malta 's gdp per capita is similar to italy or spain . 
  not even close . 
  nor is spain to italy 's . 
  sorry but that made me chuckle . 
  careful what you wish for . 
  i would much much rather have a competent king like yours than the almost comically corrupt and inefficient political institution that is our presidency . 
  why the hell would i want a career politican to represent my country and its culture ? 
  he 's there to reap himself some benefits and could n't give less of a shit about the country . 
  trust me , it 's much much worse . 
  all aboard the tck trainnnn !, 
  he also does n't `` believe '' in climate change . 
  that man 's word is worth very little . 
  that is a pretty cool flag . 
  [ this ] ( http://s59.photobucket.com/user/fernao/media/bandeiraportugalazul.png.html ) one is still better though !, 
  why 's that rich , i 'm not being hypocritical ? 
  gal is already in the name , no need to change anything . 
  the [ integrationist party ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reintegracionismo ) bounces between 2nd and 3rd in every election so it 's really not that out of the question . 
   ethnically and culturally we are one nation . 
  visit / r/portugal and / r/lisboa there 's loads of posts about tourism in lisbon !, 
  any specific questions , shoot !, 
  linking a dailymail article , how could you op . 
  trust me when i say over 30\u00ba every day is much much better than rain , cold and fog for an entire summer . 
  especially if you live by the sea , a lake , river , swimming pool , etc. 
  and in miranda do douro . 
   near the modern\u2010day spanish -- french border . 
  actually they were only stopped in [ poitiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_tours ) . 
  worth noting that the reason the moors conquered the peninsula so fast was that the visigothic kings ( who came from foreign lands ) were really despotic and did n't allow the local peasants to have weapons in fear of an uprising , so when the moors came the visigoths only had small armies and many times the local population preferred the moorish kings as they allowed religious and cultural freedom , more so than the visigothic kings . 
  the reconquista effectively started after the battle of [ covadonga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_covadonga ) where a certain pelayo was declared king of the new visigothic kingdom of asturias . 
  a couple centuries later [ v\u00edmara peres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%admara_peres ) conquered northern portugal from the moors and repopulated it . 
  he was named count of portugal after the main city portus cale ( modern day porto and gaia ) . 
  a few centuries after that portugal broke free from the leonese court in 1128 when d. afonso henriques fought the battle of [ s\u00e3o mamede ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s%c3%a3o_mamede ) against his mother . 
  d. afonso henriques was an absolute badass and 9 years later defeated 5 moorish kings in the battle of [ ourique ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ourique ) . 
  we 've had one language and one culture ever since . 
  ( with the minute exception of [ mirand\u00eas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirandese_language ) , a leonese dialect , spoken in a small hamlet in the remote east of the country . 
  if you notice , asturian and leonese sound like a mix between portuguese and spanish . 
   oh , and portugal is a bad child and breaks off . 
  it 'll come back someday , though . 
  over my dead body we will . 
  there 's nothing to go * back * to , we precede spain by 3 centuries and spain is going to break up pretty soon anyway . 
  i 'd rather a federal europe than anything else . 
  i have a feeling that galicia might join us though , when catalonia and the basque country break apart , since the spanish government has actively tried to destroy galician . 
   until the first world war , the regional languages of france were still the languages most used in the home and in the fields . 
  just read the wiki , that 's sad . 
  this sounds exactly like catalan . 
  who the hell are these people . . 
  in this thread i 've seen calls to `` end the welfare state '' , deport people for shouting allahu akbar , beat migrants and steal their belongings , etc. 
  what the fuck is up with this subreddit . 
  it 's like a mix between hardcore neo liberals and hardcore chauvinistic fascists . 
  either that or 4chan is at it again . 
  what the fuck dude . 
  even in 2009 our life expectancy at birth was 79 . 
  it 's now at 80 . 
  diet ? 
  i could use some aks , ps look set to win the next elections . 
  nice try , kosovo tourism board . 
  looks awesome , what are the negatives ? 
  i really want to visit albania , bosnia , montenegro and bulgaria now . 
  dude , it 's lumiar , i 'm not talking about the extremes . 
  the other side of the segunda circular from campo grande is lumiar . 
  whatever , if you do n't think it 's close that 's your problem . 
  i 've done that route more times than i can think and it 's always less than 10 minutes when there is no traffic . 
  without traffic it 's less than 10 minutes from the centre of the centre . 
  that 's not far at all .
