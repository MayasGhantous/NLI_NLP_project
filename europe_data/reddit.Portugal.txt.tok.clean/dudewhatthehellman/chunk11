  do n't go walking but the concelho is just pretty small . 
  lumiar is not that far from the centre . 
  in zone 6 . . 
  we do too . 
  just press the cross post button right above the bundle of sticks . 
  it was already there before . 
  they did n't create it . 
  it 's not a christian celebration , it 's a pagan one . 
  like christmas ; afaik jesus was n't born on the 25th and all of that , it 's just saturnalia and an attempt to get more followers by saying that miraculously jesus happened to have been born on the same exact day that the most important god in the roman pantheon was celebrated . 
  shocking , a `` christian '' festival is actually pagan . 
  i wonder if any christian holiday is actually genuine . 
   how do you like this ? 
  it 's not something very nice to say , is it ? 
  is that also sarcasm ? 
  hardly surprising , they hate germans . 
  damn , that 's a bit of a cultural gem right there . 
  yeah i 'm from lisbon . 
  sorry do n't think we trust you after [ what happened in iran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_of_our_lady_of_the_conception#history ) . 
  but , what of the ~ ~ empire ~ ~ commonwealth ? 
  i thought you were tired of those inferior pesky europeans and wanted new and strengthened ties to the former colonies ? 
  alternative types have always existed . 
  the word `` hipster '' in its current meaning was created in american and propagated on the internet as a meme . 
  well i 'm glad that it 's being re-appropriated into a normal , non insulting word like so many before it such as hippie , punk , yid , etc. 
  it was such a stupid meme anyway , you described it perfectly `` derogatory , generic categories with undefined values , boundaries and characters that should never be used seriously to identify people '' . 
  i use imperial , what 's that in bearskins ? 
  i 've never heard that being used . 
  it helps that they 're from turkey and not pakistan/afghanistan/bangladesh etc. 
   they 're actually just normal people woah let 's not get ahead of ourselves / s, 
  that i was n't debating then does n't mean i wo n't . 
  yeah i agree , obviously . 
  that 's how it should be though . 
  liberty is not restricted as a status quo but exceptions are made on a case by case basis . 
  hungary was one of the richest countries in europe before wwi . 
  look at you now . 
  same goes for state vs libertarian socialism . 
  nothing outstanding but fish , minerals , biodiversity and things of that nature . 
  it 's the mid-atlantic ridge so a lot of `` chimneys '' and volcanic activities create these chemicals and biological environments that are of interest to science . 
  in our southern coast we have gas but we 're too incompetent to extract it . 
  spain already does in theirs . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/portugal_eez.png ) is what portugal 's eez will look like once the new request is approved by the un ( now that spain has [ laid off our case ] ( http://observador.pt/2015/04/12/ilhas-selvagens-espanha-recua-permite-expansao-do-mar-portugues/ ) ( link in pt ) ) . 
   that ocean bitch please . 
  we have a huge eez too . 
  afaik it will be expanded to border canada this year . 
   these people are economic migrants . 
  this does not necessarily follow from this :  the wealthier they get , the more able and willing they are to move here . 
  i agree we ca n't just let in illegals without a proper integration process but the large majority of the time these people are fleeing war and famine , why do you think there has been a recent spike in migrants ? 
  that source does n't support what you 're saying , it says that as people get more resources they can finally pay to get to europe . 
  never go full analogy . 
   total debt ( public + corporate + household ) stands at 360 % of gdp read more at http://www.econotimes.com/portugal-receives-debt-warnings-from-imf-73867#jfrj4crepddmymgu.99 the one thing this conservative `` austere '' government managed to do was massively increase public debt . 
  of course this is n't even a topic of conversation in our country because it would be inconvenient . 
  indefinitely is a long time . 
  the current amount of migrants is almost insignificant . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/how-many-asylum-seekers-are-really-coming-to-the-uk-as-european-migrant-crisis-continues-10446622.html this is just the usual daily mail level rhetoric . 
  10 years ago we had more migrants coming in than now and there was no uproar . 
  obviously we need to help as many people as possible by making sure their passage into europe is safe and that they can integrate themselves well here . 
  the current method needs reform obviously , here is a good proposal for that : http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/04/21/a-new-strategic-approach-is-needed-if-the-eu-is-to-solve-the-irregular-migration-crisis-in-the-mediterranean/ it 's important to understand the causes of this influx : war and poverty . 
  we ca n't just hope to ignore that . 
  on top of that the current system for asylum seekers , those that genuinely need to flee from their home countries , is appalling in many countries including `` rich '' ones like germany , where they ca n't apply for jobs and their privacy is constantly abused . 
  people do litter a fair bit here but i 've never seen anything like that photo , especially at a beach . 
  all of those languages are not russian , is my point . 
  i see , that 's still not a good excuse though but it 's understandable , romania is n't a very developed country yet . 
  you see that in every country but less so in more developed ones . 
  it takes time to educate people to be sensitive to those things . 
  animals . 
  eesti needs to lower that if she wants into nordic . 
  yeah that too . 
  and how we should prefer christian or atheist migrants to others . 
  absolute insanity . 
  there already are border checks in the eu borders with non eu countries . 
  so much confirmation bias in this thread . 
  `` see , migrants are awful criminals coming in hordes to steal our women and burn our cities '' . 
  pathetic . 
  we only have 1 very new party that actually got 7 % of votes in their first election ( european ) . 
  psd used to be alde back in the day . 
  i take it from the downvotes that yes it is since if it were n't people would just say no . 
  i wo n't actually debate immigration ? 
  what ? 
  how did you deduce that ? 
  is this where all the xenophobes from / r/european and / r/ukpolitics come to gather ? 
  none because it 's an absolutely retarded and simplistic statement to make . 
  ironic , is n't half of the czech population in germany ? 
  they love themselves some authority . 
  it 's true though , they 're economic protectionists and both left wing and right wing parties have authoritarian state ideologies . . 
  the us does n't even have proportional representation , no welfare state and legalised corruption . 
  they have one centre-right party and one evangelical nutjob party . 
  that is not a way to run a country . 
  ah yes , fascism . 
  we tried that . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ know . 
  sure but most ex-ussr countries still have a strong left wing presence which kind of underdetermines your explanation . 
  i do n't know if you 're being serious about the us but i hope not . 
  when will the war start ? 
  literally everyone vs russia . 
  shameful how we do n't have a liberal party . 
  i think most people would vote for one if it existed , as they did before psd shifted right . 
  you 'd never guess poland is an ex-ussr country with that political spectrum . 
  makes the us look good . 
  is this the new aladeen ? 
  this should be done once per year per country . 
  in 28 years the entire union would be as rich as luxembourg and luxembourg would rocket past the rest of humanity and become a type 2 civilization .
