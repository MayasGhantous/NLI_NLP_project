  haha suck it spain !, 
  to be fair he was unfairly stripped of one for a better finding previous to that one . 
  `` men who still use hair gel '' . 
  lol reserve that for the italians . 
  not surprised . 
  italy has by far the lowest gedi index in western europe . 
  much lower than spain 's even . 
  that 's what they are though and i was never sarcastic . 
  yes you are . 
  physical violence , namely beheadings , is never something to glorify . 
  even if the ends is `` defending your land or your people against invaders , or defending yourself against an attacker/rapist/thief '' . 
  it should never be celebrated and put on a flag . 
  it 's barbaric . 
  you 've already had to resort to fighting another human and that should be lamented not celebrated . 
  i did n't mean it should n't come to that in the sense that we should n't fight for survival obviously , i meant that it is beneath the modern western adult to glorify and celebrate beheadings . 
  you 're simply stating the obvious : that violence is sometimes justified . 
  i 've already said that . 
  you 're confusing the ends and the means again . 
  violence is always bad even if the end result was justified . 
  it should n't come to that . 
  and glorifying violence on a flag in 21st century europe is inexcusable . 
  violence is never worth celebrating , not even if the ends are valid . 
  ever heard `` the ends do n't justify the means '' ? 
  thank you so much for this . 
  i must find a bottle !, 
  violence * [ no , our flag is an adaptation of the freemason and `` carbon\u00e1ria '' flag . 
  ] ( http://vexilologia.deviantart.com/art/historical-portuguese-carbonaria-flag-548106871 ) so while still horrible , it does n't signify violence explicitly . 
  calm your tits mate it 's a joke . 
  christ . . 
  i like a decapitated moor as much as the next guy ^ ^ / s but how is that still allowed in the 21st century ? 
  that specific event is completely unrelated . 
  calm down bro i 'm not having a dig at your precious religion . 
  it 's not random given that people in the middle ages did n't know better and believed those myths , but if you look at it from a modern context it 's really random . 
  completely unrelated to the creation of a country . 
  i guess so but it 's still really random to put on the flag . 
  we have a cross , it 's just made with dominoes . 
  edit : actually they represent the 5 moorish kings we killed to form the kingdom and each shield contains 5 gold byzantine coins representing the 5 `` wounds of christ '' ^ whatever ^ that ^ means . 
  there 's glorified violence on our flag , i bet you ca n't find many in europe with that . 
  ever heard of nato ? 
  for those wondering , like me , 7.1 inches = 18 cm . 
  ^ ^ small ^ ^ penis . 
  finland above denmark australia above new zealand netherlands 9th ireland above austria uk & italy above germany italy , spain & portugal above france this would be more credible if zimbabwe was first . 
  we can not into business . 
  but who pays it if the one getting the abortion is the pregnant woman who according to you does n't pay ? 
   and pregnant women do not pay the `` moderation tax '' . 
  so who pays now ? 
  hmm ? 
  yep . 
  quite the scandal . 
  i think there are more benfica fans than porto fans in the north . 
  including porto . 
  cosme dami\u00e3o was rejected from sporting was n't he ? 
  and i do n't think it 's just stereotypes . 
  most sporting fans are n't posh anymore but most posh people are sporting fans if you know what i mean . 
  yep . 
  not a strictly geographical thing as much as a cultural and economic distinction .

  no i do n't , i 'm a social liberal . 
   liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality . 
  the former principle is stressed in classical liberalism while the latter is more evident in social liberalism . 
  [ 1 ] liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles , but generally they support ideas and programs such as freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , free markets , civil rights , democratic societies , secular governments , and international cooperation . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  liberalism first became a distinct political movement during the age of enlightenment , when it became popular among philosophers and economists in the western world . 
  liberalism rejected the notions , common at the time , of hereditary privilege , state religion , absolute monarchy , and the divine right of kings . 
  the 17th-century philosopher john locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct philosophical tradition . 
  locke argued that each man has a natural right to life , liberty and property , [ 9 ] while adding that governments must not violate these rights based on the social contract . 
  liberals opposed traditional conservatism and sought to replace absolutism in government with representative democracy and the rule of law . 
  you mean psoe ? 
  holy shit . 
  liberalism in a nutshell . 
  well then you 're a homophobic bigot . 
  i hope you come to change your mind . 
  i see no benefits in an iberian union if we can have a european one . 
  plus , spain is full of internal conflict . 
   considering our `` nationalistic '' tendencies ... none ? 
  we have no nationalism in our country . 
  that died in 1974 . 
  of all the people i know in portugal , quite literally none are against a european federation . 
  from my perspective , i can completely understand this . 
  this is what it all comes down to in the end . 
  a few would , the large majority would stay . 
  you 're speculating but in any case most parties that are n't nationalist or extreme will support it . 
  most people in the eurozone support a federation according to the eu barometer . 
  they way the questions are asked is n't even posted in that article so i have no clue what you 're on about . 
   the possibility of this happening is close to zero . 
  we have to act in reality and not in fantasyland . 
  i completely disagree . 
  i think it can be well explained and politicians certainly have the duty to do so , since the choices we have in the long term are between a closer , more prosperous united states of europe or an irrelevant and dysfunctional asymmetric common market . 
  fantastic , thanks for sharing . 
   the second , and more important question , is whether the eu should develop into a federation of nation states . 
  here , only 41 percent are in favor , but , again , those against are even fewer , at 34 percent . 
  a whopping 25 percent just do not know . 
  i presume you did n't read the article . 
   do you really believe that when the 19 eurozone member countries would hold a referendum about a fiscal union that the majority of people would agree to it in this political climate ? 
  yes , if it is well presented and people are given enough time to study the matter . 
  if it is presented as a scapegoat for nationalistic appeals to emotion then of course not . 
  it depends on what rupert murdoch wants . 
  depends what you mean by `` needs '' . 
  it would fuck literally everyone overnight if they got a drachma .
