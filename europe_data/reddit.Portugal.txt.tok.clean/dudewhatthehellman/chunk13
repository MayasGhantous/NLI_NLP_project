  people would starve . 
   and unpopular with the majority in europe anyways [ not true . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-union-brexit-eurobarometer/ ), 
  if a company profits from being in a country , it has the moral obligation to add value to that country 's society . 
  otherwise there would be no point in having companies . 
  tax havens act as leeches where instead of creating any value , they let firms and people evade their taxes . 
  every country has a foreign aid budget if that 's what you 're asking . 
  just saying something is `` a shitty idea '' is not an argument , sorry . 
  you 've committed both a fallacy of composition and of false equivalence in your example , too . 
  ok , that 's just complete and utter speculation . 
  i personally think it 's cowardly to run a tax haven or to promote any form of tax evasion . 
  i think it 's cowardly to promote ways of denying resources to the poorest of other countries . 
   but is it ? 
  of course , do you enjoy having your legitimate tax revenue stolen from your country ? 
  that 's hospitals , roads , schools , jobs etc. 
  that have gone undone because of some cowardly nations . 
  as for different tax rates , it will be a federation so every nation can set their own tax rates , which will be democratically legitimised . 
  that 's a silly argument you 're making . 
  small countries would absolutely need a federation , you clearly did n't read the article . 
  without one , we 'll be in a position of chronic trade deficit with the bigger central economies . 
  i completely agree . 
  the current situation destroys the southern economies by benefiting the northern industrialised ones . 
  the industrial cartels do not want to be subject to a democratically driven federal government . 
  they want to be able to control their local economies in order to reap the best benefits they can . 
  it 's no surprise that [ it 's the elites ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-union-brexit-eurobarometer/ ) that do n't want a federation . 
  ( and to a less significant degree , some nationalists ) . 
  [ great article ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/08/29/why-is-europe-not-coming-together-in-response-to-the-euro-crisis/ ) about how a federation is the only solution to having a successful asymmetric monetary union . 
  what a bad argument . 
  there will always be disagreement , every country has it , every society has it . 
  every federation has states working in their best interest , as they should . 
  that 's healthy . 
  a political union will stabilise everything and finally make us competitive on the global scale again . 
  it will benefit the richer countries and the poorer ones as we 'll finally have economic instruments to deal with debt problems , corruption and the structural problems present in the local economies . 
  there 's literally nothing to lose but the ` muh country '' attitude . 
   because it 's a common market, 
  having a good economy is more important for society as a whole than achieving marriage equality though . 
  germany does n't have a social liberal party so it 's either economically competent but socially backwards ( cdu ) or the opposite ( spd ) . 
  well that 's a legitimate view . 
  eu gives proportional representation . 
  even more than proportional for smaller countries . 
  the eu does not have authority to implement the packages itself over a sovereign country . 
  we need a political union to give more power to the emu , [ here ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/08/29/why-is-europe-not-coming-together-in-response-to-the-euro-crisis/ ) 's a good piece by varoufakis on it . 
  still forging books ? 
  have the greeks learnt nothing ? 
   also , transfers to countries like greece have to be earmarked in order to secure they 're actually used to invest . 
  you said it yourself . 
  by giving the eu legitimate authority to carry this out on a national level , we can ensure a much better and more transparent process . 
  i thought only the croats had concentration camps . 
  til . 
  it 's *, 
   if the guy tries to push neo-liberal values , he should live them . 
  he 's a social liberal , a movement created in * reaction * to `` classical '' or `` neo '' - liberalism or `` libertarianism '' whatever you want to call it . 
  his brother [ dirk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirk_verhofstadt ) is one of the most influential social liberal political philosophers in the world . 
  in europe , `` liberal '' more often than not means '' [ social-liberal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ) '' . 
  yeah , it 's just really interesting that there 's a region in europe with a buddhist majority . 
  the eu actually saved our agriculture , look up the cap . 
  it would n't exist without its subsidies . 
   the `` gipsi '' countries well at least it was n't piigs this time . 
   700,000 or 0.4 % - buddhists ( mostly - tibetan ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmykia, 
  please be our pm . 
  we need a social liberal that fights corruption and gets shit done so badly . 
  jesus mother and joseph . 
  he 's right though they would never been able to get such cheap loans without being in the euro . 
  i agree with you that it 's a massive failure on the eu that a small economy is dragging the entire continent down . 
  we 're fucked but at least we 're not dragging anyone else down with us . 
  * you just got french 'd . 
  am i blind or is that nowhere near the size of europe ?

  yeah there was a post on / r/atheism on this where people were calling everyone to put down their pitchforks as he is n't that bad . 
  not actually a creationist and does n't put religion before evidence i read . 
  great news , thanks . 
  til , no one that i know went on it in the uk but virtually everyone i know from other countries has done it . 
  is there erasmus in the uk ? 
  never heard of anyone in the uk going on it . 
  it becomes irrelevant and undesirable though . 
  much better off as european citizens than limiting yourself to your little corner of the world . 
  aka aliens . 
  specifically the gulf stream , which also affects spain , especially the jer\u00e9z area . 
  because if it comes from portugal it should say so , that way our olive oil will never get the recognition and hence market value it should . 
  that makes me sad :( at least there 's money coming into portugal though . 
  damn , that 's a shame . 
  it 's because of the altitude in proportion to latitude , not just the latitude . 
  it does n't snow in southern portugal at all really . 
  at least not with the same frequency as in spain and the worst we can get is [ this ] ( http://searadecores.no.sapo.pt/experiencia/alentejo%20com%20neve.jpg ) which quickly melts . 
  olive trees need extreme temperatures . 
  both heat and cold . 
  why ? 
  got examples ? 
  cheers . 
  that difference would be unrealistic , we use olive oil on everything every day . 
  lots of right wingers in austria . 
  ^ ^ they ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ learn ^ ^ the ^ ^ first ^ ^ two ^ ^ times . 
  yeah the same agriculture that would n't exist were it not for the cap . 
  the salazar one is laughable . 
  yes , let 's create a state run oligopoly , that will solve our economic problems . 
  protectionism is what we need .
