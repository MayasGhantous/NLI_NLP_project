  yet you do n't provide a single argument against mine , you 're actually mostly agreeing with what i 've said . 
      nah it was more to do with the fact that poland overcompensated for a previous lack of national identity stemming from centuries of being played around . 
    lack of national identity   `` poland had no national identity before it was suddenly invented in 1989 '' . 
    this alone was a one big `` i have no idea what i 'm talking about '' flag , but , masochistic as i am , i kept reading curious to find out what other revelations i 'll find . 
    stemming from centuries of being played around   literally centuries . 
  two of them . 
    and yes , they are important especially considering how big part of our national identity is `` for centuries we used to be a great empire that lately fallen due to inside and outside factors , but despite that we managed to survive and reborn ... twice '' , which due to circumstances gradually replaced the earlier `` we are the great and powerful country of the free people , with the most perfect type of government in the world , comparable only to roman republic '' one . 
    then again , if poland has a `` lack of national identity '' , i do n't know who does n't . 
  here you 've conflated me saying the polish people struggled for a national identity with some sort of argument that polish culture did n't exist or that poland was n't a country . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  what i 'm saying is that poland went through an unprecedented change in territory and its accompanying socio political consequences over its history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_evolution_of_poland that obviously leads to a crisis in identity , i do n't need to explain why . 
       this backlash is seen mainly in parts that used to belong to russia ,   which also explains why the more conservative and nationalist party has by far the strongest support in the region that in 19th century was ruled by austria , and where poles had autonomy so vast that compared to either russian or german-occupied parts it was almost as good as if it remained independent poland . 
  read : * mainly * . 
  i do n't pretend to know about the austrian part but it was just as tossed about as the rest , if not more . 
     a lack of national identity is also why poland is very catholic compared to ,   at this point i start to doubt whether you have any idea what this `` lack of national identity phrase '' you keep using ever means . 
    catholicism is a part of our national identity . 
  mate , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  you are more catholic because it 's an important part of your identity that differentiates you from the rest . 
   another interesting discovery . 
  so , when exactly was our `` nationalistic phase '' , between 2005 and 2007 ? 
  again , i 've just said it was an effect of centuries of being tossed around and subsequent understandable overcompensation . 
  i 'm not making this up dude . 
   [ modern polish nationalism arose as a movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries amongst polish activists who promoted a polish national consciousness while rejecting cultural assimilation with the states they then resided in , russia , prussia , or austria . \\ [ 9 \\ ] this was the consequence of polish statelessness , as the polish nationality was suppressed by the authorities of countries which acquired the territory of the former commonwealth . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_nationalism#history ), 
  nah it was more to do with the fact that poland overcompensated for a previous lack of national identity stemming from centuries of being played around . 
  this backlash is seen mainly in parts that used to belong to russia , probably because like you said poland got screwed hard but a lack of national identity is also why poland is very catholic compared to , say , the czechs . 
  if you look at eastern bloc countries or areas ( like east germany ) , most of them are more left leaning than right . 
  the exceptions being poland and hungary who both went through more nationalistic phases after the fall of the ussr . 
  mother of christ that must be the most right wing country in the world after the usa . 
  to think it 's ex-communist . 
  one thing i 'll never understand about the uk . 
  i meant a universal healthcare system , i did n't think i had to point that out . 
  i thought it was obvious , sorry . 
  i do n't think you understand how federalisation works . 
  countries already have to meet certain ( copenhagen ) criteria to enter the eu and this translates to an ability to meet european standards for public health . 
  you provide no argument to base your claims on though . 
  federalisation would mean more money pumped to poor countries and a better ability to oversee its usage . 
  corruption , which is the biggest problem for implementation of policies in the southern and eastern countries , would be minimised and thus inequality lessened . 
  the united states and the eu are fundamentally different though . 
  lobbying in the eu is completely unlinke lobbying in the us for example . 
  and quite the contrary , the us does not have a sovereign debt or foreign policy problem like we do , despite several cities and states having declared bankruptcy and there being a big political north/south divide . 
  the us has different problems , yes . 
  for example massive inequality and no healthcare but that 's not related to federalism . 
  federalism is n't inherently good but in the case of the eu it would solve a lot of problems that are currently in a state of limbo . 
  it 's not a sufficient reason for our continent to improve but it 's necessary ,, 
  maybe you do n't understand the difference between debt and deficit . 
  look at any conservative campaign poster and you 'll see the phrase :  labour left britain with the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history . 
  one in every four pounds the last labour government spent was borrowed money . 
  [ after a painful and turbulent decade under the tories , the public finances had finally been brought under control . 
  but after four years in office gordon brown took out the country 's credit card and let rip . 
  by the end of 2009-10 our annual deficit had ballooned to # 170.8 billion . 
  ] ( http://www.debtbombshell.com/britains-budget-deficit.htm ) here 's another source : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/oct/18/deficit-debt-government-borrowing-data so hopefully this puts to rest your worries about both premises being true although i had already shown multiple sources . 
  conclusion does n't follow ? 
  it 's a simple [ constructive dilemma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constructive_dilemma ) , of course it follows , the only legitimate argument you could make would be to falsify one of the premises , not that they do n't follow . 
  and the evidence is there so the argument is sound . 
  p implies q r implies s p is true and r is true , therefore q and s.  ***** labour have bad economic policies , their track record is necessarily bad . 
  labour have even more extreme versions of past economic policies , the future of the economy under them will necessarily be even worse . 
  conclusion : their economic policies have not worked and will be even more unsustainable in the future . 
  yeah that 's a good point . 
  incorrect . 
  i 've presented various sources explaining exactly how labour 's plans to `` balance the books '' are in actual fact just a plan to borrow more . 
  borrowing to their levels has led to the public finance crisis that we are experiencing now , and a major reason why the uk has had to suffer through austerity . 
  ( tuition fees are an obvious reminder of this ) labours track record on public finance is deplorable and their plans for the future are their most economically radical since the 80s . 
  premise a : labours track record is bad . 
  premise b : their future plans are more extreme than their past 's and there is certainly no difference in their intention to reduce the deficit . 
  conclusion : their economic plans are unsustainable . 
  which is such a false analogy to the uk 's situation that that comparison is irrelevant . 
  ukraine is also not a part of nato . 
  well if you read that and think it 's sustainable then no amount of evidence will convince you otherwise . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33wwdm/its_a_week_and_a_half_till_the_uk_general/cqpnzvf the uk 's deficit has been halved in proportion to gdp since labour came in . 
  halved !, 
  marx also knew more about politics than me . 
  stalin did too . 
  oh look at that brilliant economist over there hayek or even friedman . 
  see why this is a bad argument or do i need to point it out to you ? 
  great article . 
  nothing is wrong with sustainable borrowing , but labour [ will borrow far too much for the wealth they create . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/12/david-cameron-labour-path-to-ruin ) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11533790/labour-manifesto-when-balancing-the-books-means-more-borrowing.html [ in the last year of the labour government , the deficit was # 153 billion -- meaning they were borrowing # 1 for every # 4 they spent . 
  ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/deficit ) plus labour are pro id cards , internet surveillance , and prohibitions ( thinking the ridiculous pornography ones and drugs ) . 
  [ on top of that they 're in favour of privatising the nhs . 
  ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/labour-rank-hypocrisy-on-nhs-privatisation ) they do n't sound very left wing after having written all that down . 
  great argument . 
  fallacy of authority . 
  alde are , and the ld are part of them . 
  labour have jumped on the [ anti immigration rhetoric ] ( https://shop.labour.org.uk/media/images/products/2015/03/pledge_4_mug_-_controls_on_immigration.jpg ) though and lost any sympathy i had for them . 
  entirely against the concept of free movement . 
  i do n't dislike the greens but they 're very anti-science ( anti-nuclear , anti gmo ) and quite [ unrealistic with their goals . 
  ] ( https://theconversation.com/manifesto-check-green-party-tax-plans-are-grossly-unrealistic-40649 ) they seem to think there 's unlimited money . 
  they 've also got quite a bad track record in brighton and they 're not in favour of ending the war on drugs or promoting secular equality . 
  labour are not pro federalisation . 
  greens i think are sympathetic to the idea but they 're not as commited to it as alde is . 
  a special kind of insanity called evidence ? 
  no of course not . 
  this only applies to someone with the tuition fee argument . 
  haha yeah it 's so strange but to be honest i blame a lack of exposure to the debate . 
  the eu just does n't make any effort to promote federalism to the public . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i do n't see why he has to be against the democratically elected snp . . 
  that 's a good way to see it , i really hope so . 
  there would literally be no negative difference for the average person and we 'd be well influenced by the richer , more liberal countries .
