  great . 
  you must be the genius around here . 
  you must be stuck in the inquisition . 
   [ according to william nichols , religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds . 
  `` the dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a jew ceased to be a jew upon baptism . '', 
  however , with racial antisemitism , `` now the assimilated jew was still a jew , even after baptism ... from the enlightenment onward , it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews ... once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance , without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews , the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable , even before explicitly racist doctrines appear . 
  '' \\ [ 68 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism#racial_antisemitism ) i also suggest you read up on [ ad hominem . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) regardless if anti-semitism is directed just at jews or also at other semites , my point still stands that criticising an idea is not bigotry . 
   right wing social liberals this is like saying communist fascists or left wing conservatives . 
  what . 
  what 's a hipster ? 
  are n't the centre party social liberals ? 
  in portugal we have one extremely small party ( mpt ) that is social liberal . 
  it 's not even represented in government . 
  great firm ? 
  some old drunk boneheads attacking families is what you judge to be a `` great firm '' ? 
  they 're pathetic cowards . 
  marriage is n't `` supposed '' to be anything . 
  marriage is n't a universal truth , it 's a social construct . 
  this is why / u/thmz is right , it 's reductionist and hyperbole . 
  are you unable to see that the root of the words in these cases are absolutely demonstrative of their meanings ?

  [ the word comes from the greek words \u03be\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \\ ( xenos \\ ) , meaning `` strange '' , `` foreigner '' , and \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 ( phobos ) , meaning `` fear '' .

  [ you 're under the dunning-kruger effect . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ), 
  you provide no evidence for your claims and i have falsified yours . 
  this is a bit late but i feel you 're being unfair . 
   now , if the aim is to target those who have broken pledges pertaining to tuition fees , then surely labour are fair game :  * in 1998 , they introduced tuition fees at # 1,000 . 
   * in 2001 , the party said they would not raise tuition fees . 
   * in 2004 , they went on to triple fees to just over # 3,000 . 
   * in 2009 , they commissioned the browne review , which recommended unlimited tuition fees . 
  as a whole i agree with her conclusion :  frankly , considering the lib dems are the minority party , i am very proud of what they have managed to achieve whilst in government . 
  for example , same-sex marriage thanks entirely to lynne featherstone , mp for hornsey and wood green . 
  making the first # 10,600 of income tax-free and numerous other policies would not have happened without the liberal democrats . 
  we have managed to legislate a lot of our manifesto -- quite an achievement for a minority party . 
   this is not to say that the lib dems are absolved of all guilt -- it 's merely a contextualisation of policy on tuition fees for the past couple of decades . 
  me too !, 
  i suppose this is true . 
  that stupid to what ? 
  [ use the correct definition of semite ?

  you ca n't be a bigot towards ideas . 
  xenophobia does not apply to ideas .

  do you know what `` semitic '' means ? 
  [ it 's an ethnicity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semitic_people ) arabs can be victims of anti-semitism . 
  there are more muslim semites than jewish ones . 
  awesome , shame his local government failed him . 
  and you were just as wrong back then . 
  you 're a cultural relativist , that 's embarrassing . 
  you also do n't realise the difference between inherent characteristics that people are born with ( e.g. 
  being of a certain ethnicity ) and ideas ( e.g. 
  religion ) . 
  imagine a world where you ca n't criticise an idea for fear of insult . 
  what ? 
  how ? 
  islam is a system of beliefs , how is criticising it any different from criticising any other ? 
  he did n't skip leg day . 
  [ so boys , when do we invade ?

   islamophobia in europe . 
  because criticising ideas is now bigotry .

  still , according to another post [ slovenia grew 2.61 % ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/32sof6 ) in 2014 which is really good all things considered . 
  i do n't know what the percentage is but judging by the fact that only [ 700,000 of all the jobs in the uk \\ ( 2.35 \\ ) are zero-hour i do n't think it 's as big of a problem as you make it seem ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/25/zero-hours-contract-rise-staff-figures ) . 
  in fact , for younger people like me zero hours are a blessing . 
  also  currently , people claiming jobseeker 's allowance are not required to apply for zero-hours contract vacancies and do not face penalties for turning them down . 
  i wish we had swedish or dutch politicians . 
  this shit is embarrassing . 
  ireland , teach us how !, 
  you need more sfp and less conservatives .

  i 'm not making a normative claim , simply a descriptive one . 
  obviously that was going to be turkey 's reaction , the impact of the media is negligible and ceteris paribus nothing will change as a consequence . 
  i 'm not changing jack shit , i 'm adding to the fact that the pope 's opinion on international relations is n't taken seriously amongst governments . 
  to his minions sure , and that i 'm not contesting yet it 's what people are replying to me . 
  everyone just missed the point of what i 'm saying . 
  also you have n't * proved * anything . 
  it 's not really the pope 's job to stir debate in international relations though . 
  religious matters sure , but it 's not like the vatican has a strong economic or sociopolitical weight . 
  he means the biggest steel producer in greece . 
   `` he added that he would not be there talking about the greek crisis if the eu had been federalised . '',
