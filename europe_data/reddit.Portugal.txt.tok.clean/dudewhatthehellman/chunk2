  gib and oliven\u00e7a have no relationship other than being an inconsistent point of view from the spaniards . 
  which is exactly what that fallacy is . 
  that final threat is funny because it 's the people of la linea , one of spain 's biggest shitholes , that suffer the most from that . 
  i see . 
  what i meant was that since it 's the same treaty that gives ceuta to spain and oliven\u00e7a to portugal , if they want ceuta , they have to give us oliven\u00e7a back . 
  i do n't care for ceuta if its people chose to become spanish . 
  it 's completely hipocritical to claim both ceuta and oliven\u00e7a at the same time . 
  also regarding the people of oliven\u00e7a i told you what happened already . 
  the right to eez is n't whether they 're islands or not , because it 's an entire archipelago . 
  it 's based on whether people can live there year round , which they do . 
  on top of that spain does indeed claim sovereignty over the islands . 
  never since the spineless jorge sampaio decided to recognise it as theirs . 
  but really , spain are really imperialist . 
  it 's beneficial for the people of algeciras to have a tax haven like gibraltar there and most of the people that work in modest jobs in gibraltar are actually spanish and they get along well . 
  spain already control the strait because ceuta decided to side with them for some strange reason , and the same treaty that legitimises spanish control of ceuta , gives oliven\u00e7a to portugal . 
  afaik the portuguese population of oliven\u00e7a fled so that if there was a referendum now it would mostly be the spanish voting and obviously they would want to stay . 
  even worse , spain claims the selvagens islands which is probably the most ridiculous land claim in europe . 
  this is the original source : http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf page 27 . 
  on a global scale europe is still the best along with oceania . 
  i 'd also say this is somewhat inaccurate seeing as portuguese crime rate is very very low . 
  to add , 2.5-6 .99 is an enormous gap compared to the other ones . 
  i 'd say places like wallonia and algarve are closer to 2.5 and places like eastern europe are closer to 6.99 another point worth adding is that the higher ones could just be a statistical anomaly in that one particular year where the population is small . 
  places like algeciras in spain have an astronomical crime rate compared to algarve but this map does n't show that . 
  edit : i tried to look at the statistics shown by the portuguese government but they do n't seem to exist per region at least in the public domain : http://www.siej.dgpj.mj.pt/webeis/index.jsp?username=publico&amp;pgmwindowname=pgmwindow_635394761127656250, 
  i do n't think it 's accurate . 
  portuguese crime has been [ falling for over 10 years now ] ( http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/houve-menos-crimes-em-portugal-em-2013-mas-violencia-domestica-matou-mais-tres-pessoas-1630188 ) and are at a historic best . 
  no shit . 
  good to know it 's as many as 3 million . 
  * woosh *, 
  good thing she does n't have political influence and power . 
  jesus fuck we 're poor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bratt_system sweden 's alcohol intake is n't different to western europe 's . . 
  yeah much better since they scrapped prohibition . 
  brothels are illegal in spain my ass . 
  i do n't know what `` moralist '' means but sweden has some of the most archaic recreational drug laws in europe , and i include alcohol in that . 
  very well put !, 
  it 's a fucking disgrace that we have to accept investment from criminals and other delinquents coming from countries with no rule of law and institutionalised corruption . 
  our justice system is so poor . 
   portugal dropped the charges agaisnt him can you sauce that ? 
  all from a little place called cabinda which is n't particularly fond of the rest of the country .

  van gall masterclass , destroyed his creation total football . 
  piqu\u00e9 , casillas and ramos were atrocious !, 
   robbens, 
  sauce ? 
  nothing wrong with hearing the conservative opinion , feel free to paint a different picture !, 
   so what you have here is a socialist government that failed to do anything right for 8 years and the eu was ` ok ' with it . 
  haha , i know the feeling !, 
  thanks a lot for your answers , i appreciate it . 
  it just seems a bit shocking is all . 
  and what about this sort of stuff : http://www.euractiv.com/euro-finance/eu-readies-economic-sanctions-hu-news-510987, 
  so how do you explain this : http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2013/december/hungary-sliding-back-to-nazi-era-anti-semitism/ and this : http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/27/us-hungary-antisemitism-idusbrea3q0k420140427, 
  a comprehensive review of the politics really . 
  is there anti-semitism ? 
  why are journalists being prosecuted ? 
  why is nationalism on the rise ? 
  why do people vote for what seems like an increasingly authoritarian and dangerous regime ? 
  i know you wish to emphasize how the crown is surrounded by corruption but that 's a simplistic conclusion to take . 
  here in portugal , our monarchy was taken replaced by a republic as you may know . 
  now , instead of having an a-political head of state , we have one with political ideals that has been [ accused of corruption , outright lied in public about it ] ( http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1248925 ) and would be in jail if we had a minimally efficient justice system . 
  there have even been cases of people [ fined for insulting the president ] ( http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/multado-em-1300-euros-por-mandar-cavaco-trabalhar-1597190 ) , something a functioning democracy would not accept . 
  his popularity is so low at the moment it 's [ actually negative ] ( http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/cavaco-e-o-primeiro-pr-com-popularidade-negativa_116487.html ) , which at the very least hints at national dissonance . 
  this [ blog post ] ( http://anticorrupcaopt.blogspot.pt/2013/09/a-verdade-escondida-sobre-cavaco-silva.html ) in portuguese highlights some good points showing just how much of a screw up the man we chose to become president is . 
  all the links are in portuguese because obviously none of this is written in english . 
   our king was a total incompetent that denied democracy ( not happening in your case ) and spent money on himself while the empire went to shit that 's incredbily untrue . 
  our king carlos i was extremely popular and the republican party had 4 ( !! ), 
  seats in parliament when the regicide happened . 
  the republic was instilled by [ masonic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/revoltosos_nas_barricadas_marcha_com_a_bandeira_da_carbonaria.jpg/220px-revoltosos_nas_barricadas_marcha_com_a_bandeira_da_carbonaria.jpg ) [ terrorists ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/manuel-reis-buica-morto.jpg ) and the republican party advocated violence to achieve its goals . 
  do i want to click that though ? 
  lol, 
  too extreme . 
  i also do n't want uneducated muslims taking over europe but that does n't mean i 'm not happy to take on as many as possible without causing social distress . 
  his use of the `` oil and vinegar '' analogy is very poor and a sign of populism , as well as his use of the church vs mosque example . 
  i think we just have to find a sweet spot where our cultural values are enriched , rather than overtaken , by immigrants . 
  it 's no lie that islam is even worse of a religion than christianity and that even its mainstream followers have some horrible and authoritative beliefs . 
  this does n't mean though that we have to be xenophobic . 
  eventually , far , far into the future , our cultures will be a lot more mixed than they are today anyway , it just has to be a sustainable evolution . 
  even if it is n't though , cultures and countries have gone through radical change before and survived to be healthy . 
   so when the wahhabis and salafis tell us we are dirty unwashed , decadent kafirs , source ? 
  from my personal experience , in portugal more of us speak english and much better than the spanish , french and italians . 
  i honestly ca n't believe the difference is only 5 % . 
  people ca n't speak english for shit in spain . 
  i really do n't have an experience where less than 1/3 people speak english . 
  must be the older generations . 
  we speak much more english than our spanish counterparts of the same age though . 
  for brazilians , i do n't know anyone that uses media in brazilian portuguese . 
  hellno . 
  funniest shit ever . 
  it 's very one way . 
  we understand them , they do n't understand us . 
  i do n't . 
  most of us can hold a conversation in english but not in spanish . 
  we can make out what you 're saying but if we replied in portuguese you would n't understand anything so it 's better to use a language everyone understands . 
  yes they are .
