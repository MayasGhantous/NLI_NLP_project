  they 've also banned facebook because `` it can be used to criticise the state and islam '' . 
  that 's an incorrect inference . 
  lots of irrelevant events get media attention . 
  because anything even close to criticising religion , although that 's not what i 'm doing , is seen as / r/atheism leaking . 
  overcompensating . 
   catholicism is not a religion . 
  i do n't need to read further to disregard your opinion . 
  no , you 're misunderstanding me . 
  i 'm not saying catholics do n't exist ( why would i ) , i 'm saying that on the level of international relations , what the pope has to say has no impact . 
  news outlets report what gets them clicks and views , not necessarily the most significant events in international relations . 
  catholicism is a religion last i checked . 
  that 's an absurd argument . 
  by that line of thought paris hilton 's opinion on the holodomor is more important than a head of state 's . 
  while it 's great pr and i 'm sure many catholics will listen , what i 'm saying is that on an international relations level it will be forgotten come wednesday . 
  nor is anyone 's , what a massive tautology . 
  his opinion has the political impact of a wet rag . 
  he 's the head of a religion , not nato . 
  no it does n't . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  the vatican 's views on international politics are completely irrelevant . 
  most people in portugal prefer it too . 
  personally , i 'd rather have that flag , without a monarchy . 
  those are some particularly silly hats . 
  his opinion is taken as seriously as ours . 
  no one actually cares . 
  are you serious ? 
  nicky was obviously . 
  funny how despite being cousins one was a crazy despot and the other was quite civil for his time . 
  jesus christ , how ? 
  i have fiber to my house and i get 40mb/s on wifi and that serves my needs completely . 
  clearly this is a server or something , that ca n't be your home connection . 
  hey , how about letting women vote in your country ? 
  thanks . 
  analogous to islam and `` islamophobia '' . 
  the one you posted is n't even a mix . 
  judging by the amount of brits here this is all they want . 
  that 's a stereotypical old portuguese woman . 
  how can brazilian women be so different if they 're just portuguese with a little native/black mix . 
  [ this is the closest we have . 
  ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/nrp_sagres_iii#/media/file:n.r.p._sagres,_navio-escola._for%c3%a7as_armadas_marinha_portuguesa..jpg ), 
  aka we give you port [ you steal our colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ) `` alliance '' . 
  it 's ok , coming from americans and a britain drinking port , being based on brazilians supposedly not knowing who we are and the spanish talking , we ca n't really take this seriously !, 
  portugal refuses to take in any refugees that happen to land in denmark . 
  `` confederation of the rhine '' lol, 
  i love how that shows the spanish colonies in their entirety but the portuguese ones are only coastlines . . 
  where is china coming from ? 
  or switzerland . 
  but france is clearly both in the economic centre of europe and the centre of the eurozone . 
  should also mention austria . 
  we 're talking about the core of the euro zone not the bleeding hot banana this is n't gcse macro economics keep up mate . 
  france and italy bruv . 
  70 % first trimester of 2013 http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/producao-renovavel-abastece-70-do-consumo-nacional-de-electricidade-no-1%c2%ba-trimestre-1589896 still , that last 30-40 % should be nuclear , then it would be ideal . 
  loving all these unfalsifiable claims . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita #europe _ 1830 . e2 .80.931938 _ .28 bairoch .29 1938 , guess it was only because of the war and the margin was very small . 
  somehow because we were dirt poor but spain managed to be poorer . 
  this was in the 30s and 40s though . 
  civil war and spain was a poorer country somehow . 
  bullshit was spain richer than us in 1938 !, 
  also greece 's 1990 stats are false . 
  christ / r/europe you went full retard on this one . 
   `` even though there are tough conditions , we need to stand firm on the fact that the country where one first enters is the country where they seek asylum , '' the danish justice minister said . 
  she 's not saying they want less refugees , she 's just saying she does n't want to be responsible for the consequences of other eu countries letting in refugees . 
  all of you that have jumped on this chance to hate on refugees and their acceptance should be ashamed of yourselves . 
  having said that , this is still ridiculous since intaking refugees , if well managed , has no negative effect at all on the country and saves lives . 
  even at the current rate that greece is intaking refugees the eu as a whole can stand that without the slightest problem . 
  plus , if we can give them an opportunity for a better life at no cost to us , it would be immoral not to . 
  they 've seen enough horrors already . 
  overrated coffee . 
  oh shit this 'll get the kebabs going . 
  we have as advanced infrastructure and unfortunately we have much more experience with war . 
  u mad bro ? 
  i seem to have rustled your patriotic jimmies . 
  you probably do n't know but i was referencing this : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary, 
  says the finn . 
  making it all the worse than no one does anything about it . 
  not an exclave . 
  that 's not working very well for denmark . 
  edit : for those asking : http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/03/danish-reserves-hit-record-as-central-bank-fights-for-the-peg/, 
  we ( eu ) are the # 1 economy and soon enough military too . 
  oh really ? 
  even the ones bought in germany ? 
  what a bummer , that 's totally going to affect my life now . 
  speak for yourself . 
  expensive ? 
  they 're cheaper for americans to buy now . 
  crazy how slovenia is a perfectly nice country but bosnia or macedonia are kind of scary . 
   are n't really any more hardcore catholics than italians . 
  so pretty hardcore . 
  hybrids are only worth it for urban areas . 
  people can hardly afford regular cars so they would never buy expensive electric cars , especially without a grid . 
  worse , 70 % of electricity is now renewable . 
  http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/producao-renovavel-abastece-70-do-consumo-nacional-de-electricidade-no-1%c2%ba-trimestre-1589896 now we just need everyone to start driving around in electric tuk tuks or [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gof0tavb9wu ) and for the metro to stop going on strike . 
  andorra is in the eu, 
  big reason why most of spain is drier than most of portugal . 
  once again alde being the only reasonable party . 
  interesting that 60 + are n't as chauvinistic as 40-59 . 
  there were a few posts with the opposite too , bad spanish roads and good portuguese ones . 
  shows how stupid those comparisons are . 
  we suffer from a brain drain , any skilled labour coming our way is good . 
  why do you need a break for beer ?
