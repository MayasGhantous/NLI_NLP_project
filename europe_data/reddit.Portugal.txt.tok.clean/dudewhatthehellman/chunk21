  you 're already at the match , if you 're not then you 're either at home or at the pub , in any of these cases you can have beer whenever you want . 
  there 's also half time , if you need more than 15 minutes to order a beer you need to sort yourself out . 
  those hats look great though but you 're probably just sipping gas . 
  mate , catch up . 
   the liberals in the european parliament have already come out strong against the countries ' version of the rules , stating they `` are more interested in defending the interests of their national telecom operators than creating real competition that would provide cheaper rates for citizens and businesses '' . 
  thank the lord for the eu . 
  national governments seem so keen on just exploiting their citizens as much as possible, 
  seems like shaktar hooligans . 
  no it 's not , it 's because you need an attention span greater than 5 seconds . 
  `` carbonari '' means `` coal burners '' . 
  `` burrowed '' money you 'll only find in colombia .

  there were literal wars in portugal between portuguese people for decades , one example being in the established monarchy of the north . 
  there was no stable government for decades either , no one had jurisdiction or authority anywhere . 
  the main political force during the prec was pcp and they did lots of communist things such as nationalise all industry and agriculture , and taking private property from its owners , i 'm not exaggerating . 
  i know there 's no use arguing with you but all those are true , i do n't know what else to say if you 're portuguese and do n't know that . 
  read up on the monarchy of the north , how there were 39 governments in 16 years , the process of nationalisation of everything and persecution of `` anti-revolutionaries '' during the revolutionary period ( * hint * : communist revolution ) , etc. 
  ethnically we 're one of the most homogenous nations in the world , so not really , quite the opposite actually . 
  i 'd love that too . 
  portugal would be split up into ... portugal . 
  spain on the other hand , wow what a clusterfuck . 
  would n't brussels be the capital of wallonia ? 
  it 's french-speaking . 
  yeah sorry no , that period was from 1910 to 1928 where we had 39 governments in 16 years with lots of crime and [ civil wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_the_north ) . 
   because it didnt work for the people , and because it lost army support , a couple of man would never end a monarchy that 's simply not true , sorry . 
  https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/implanta\u00e7\u00e3o_da_rep\u00fablica_portuguesa  but the will of the poeple allways wins in the end . 
  that 's exactly my point , it was n't the will of the people at all . 
  the `` defeat '' to the british was indeed a big blow to national pride . 
   the republicans had the sergeants and the regular soldiers most of the population was monarchist , including soldiers and the elite . 
  the failure of the government forces was down to pure incompetence , the carbon\u00e1ria cut off all telegraph lines from lisbon to the rest of the country for example and there were over 2,000 troops and police ready to go in lisbon that simply did n't because no one ordered them to . 
   taking the backseat and becoming a head figure of the country , what do you mean , portugal was a constitutional monarchy since the liberal wars . 
  you can read about all this here . 
  the fact of the matter is that the large majority of people did n't want a republic . 
  you again . 
  everything i said is historically correct you can read about it [ here ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/implanta%c3%a7%c3%a3o_da_rep%c3%bablica_portuguesa ) , [ here ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/primeira_rep%c3%bablica_portuguesa ) , and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/processo_revolucion%c3%a1rio_em_curso ) . 
  the carbonaria was instrumental in creating the republic , there were armed revolts everywhere and they essentially created a civil war . 
  iirc the republican party did n't even have a majority in parliament . 
  none of this was done democratically either , they assassinated the king and prince and then faught until they had destroyed the opposition . 
  they were a brutal masonic secret society . 
  the preceding governments were inept sure but that 's not really an argument against the monarch at the time , he was a patron of science and arts , quite progressive for his time . 
  what i 'm saying is that the overturning of the monarchy was a savage affair done by a `` secret society '' and led to nothing but shit . 
  exactly, 
  we are in 2015 . 
  bit of a fallacy there . 
  it 's ok bro let it all out . 
  bit of an oxymoron , what are they going to do volunteer to enter the ovens first ? 
  shame because he was a good king , too . 
  no the monarchy was overthrown by the freemasons and the [ carbon\u00e1ria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon%c3%a1ria ) . 
  our flag is [ still a carbon\u00e1ria flag ] ( https://image.slidesharecdn.com/1294586040abandeiraeohinoaaa-120907183743-phpapp01/95/1294586040-a-bandeiraeohinoaaa-57-728.jpg?cb=1347043199 ) . 
  this is what those [ thugs ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/implanta%c3%a7%c3%a3o_da_rep%c3%bablica_portuguesa#/media/file:revoltosos_nas_barricadas_marcha_com_a_bandeira_da_carbonaria.jpg ) looked like . 
  what followed was over a century of civil wars , total anarchy , fascism , communism and corrupt republic . 
  porto is awesome but needs to catch up on a lot of stuff still . 
  such as losing the complex of inferiority . 
  you do n't need to use @ 's on reddit . 
  it 's also spelt `` yourself '' . 
  great argument too , trying to justify xenophobia . 
  do you have difficulty reading ? 
  it 's not just that they 're anti-federalist , although that would make them against the european project .

  indeed they are . 
  great summary though , thanks . 
  of course it 's fair , it 's called equality under the law . 
  why does poland get to be racist and discriminatory in its refugee policies ? 
  it 's not like poles have n't suffered in the past because of the very same bigotry . 
  this is exactly the type of stuff eastern europe needs to catch up on , you 're like 70 years behind . 
  so why is your new government a little eurosceptic, 
  of course not , but besides the visegrad group , no one tries to collude against the rest of the eu on humanitarian issues . 
  poland and hungary are particularly vocal . 
  just a shame sweden 's has n't grown at the same pace . 
  great news for germany though , yes . 
  they 've still exceeded my expectations . 
  they 're richer than any other ( non micro ) country besides norway and switzerland . 
  haha maybe i 'll walk past you , weird to think that . 
  i hope it 's not true , poland is getting a lot of bad press at the moment , especially with the demonstrations outside your embassies now . 
  this is what i mean about poland and cooperation . 
  haha that 's cool that you 're here . 
  portugal was absolutely ready to do it , none of what has happened has been due to the eu or the euro . 
  that 's cool if you 're not . 
  i remember your new government removing eu flags for example and not accepting the quotas . 
  poland have taken a eurosceptic tone as of recent and they 're very much against co-operating with the eu in dealing with the refugee and migrant crises . 
  poland is also not in the euro yet . 
  i 'm positively surprised in seeing them ( or you ) be proactive in increasing cooperation with other states . 
  this should be the main post . 
  a few thoughts : shame to see finland and sweden fall to and below germany 's level . 
  i wonder where gibraltar stands . 
  good to see the netherlands and slovenia doing so well . 
  czechoslovakia and greece too . 
  ( + finland , monaco , andorra and san marino ), 
  poland . . increasing cooperation !? 
  surely they must consider this heresy . 
  damn , not very liberal huh,
