  no there is no conspiracy by the moroccan government to send people to europe and no not all moroccans go to europe and remain unemployed on benefits . 
  no you do n't . 
  liberalism is a philosophical ideology distinct from the political term ` left wing ' . 
  the usa is the only country in the world where liberal is ( absurdly ) synonymous with state socialism . 
  even in canada the liberals are in the centre . 
   superliberal leftist this is n't / r/murica one thing is liberal , a very different one is left wing . 
   i could not believe she was almost willing to allow him to walk because she felt bad . 
  i ca n't believe you let regular people make your decisions in court for you . 
  are any of the parties social liberal ? 
  where do parties stand on the eu ? 
  maybe that 's not the case in there but it does happen like that . 
  source ? 
  i 've seen a lot of empty houses . 
  but if 1 % are new rich arabs like in london that 's enough to skyrocket house prices because it creates a multiplier effect of attracting foreign investors and speculators, 
  `` brits '' are a lot of people . 
  i 've met plenty that prefer the douro valley and you may not know this but pretty much all port wine manufacturers are owned by british families . 
  stereotypically , working class brits from the north of england prefer albufeira , more affluent ones prefer the quinta do lago area or northern portugal . 
  lisbon is quite popular with youth . 
  we already have one , it 's the oldest alliance in history . 
  * sharpens chouri\u00e7o *, 
  i was going to say , we were around for centuries before spain was a thing . 
  sorry internet . 
  that might be why it happened historically but it 's still not a legitimate reason to justify mechanisms of oppression .

  yeah i have the same experience , most of the portuguese youth i know prefer a common european identity and are n't patriotic about portugal . 
  most of the people i know that travel and have lived in different countries are undoubtedly in favour of further integration . 
  i did , that makes no difference for the tyranny of the majority . 
  you still vote on matters where a democratic vote should never take place . 
   and a significantly worse economy . 
  you 're downplaying how much worse . 
  spain ca n't take that many migrants . 
  false dichotomy . 
  your tinfoil hat fell . 
  you mean an incentive to stay ? 
  i 'm assuming the czech republic has functioning legal and police systems ? 
  simple solution : http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/01/why-the-refugee-quota-system-is-unfair-on-poorer-eastern-and-southern-eu-states/ and i agree , the more union the better . 
  it 's plainly obvious that the sooner we get over the emotional ties of nationalism the better . 
  you would have thought people would have realised by now that nationalism does n't lead to particularly great things . 
  oh here we go . 
  say after me `` fuck other humans '' . 
  direct democracy is really immoral : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyranny_of_the_majority, 
  i do n't know anything about the situation but if this is just a front and he does in fact support sanctions that 's fine . 
  exactly , states like the czech republic and hungary just want to pin it all on greece of all places . 
  insanely selfish and demonstrates a lack of basic morality . 
  i agree refugees should be fairly distributed proportionally to every country and not just given to the richer countries but forcing them to stay in the first country of contact is ludicrous . 
  i agree with as localised politics as possible but an irish system would lead to examples of political insanity like voting on whether women should be allowed to abort . 
  i do n't think it 's `` too distant '' , if by that you mean it does n't affect our day to day : all significant consumer standards are set at an eu level for example . 
  also the lack of democracy in the eu is a [ complete myth ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/myth_european.pdf ) propagated by the likes of ukip and the tabloid press . 
  well opposing sanctions on russia is fairly stupid after what they 've done . 
  absolutely nails it , again . 
  what we need is a true political union , not the 12 different agreements . 
  none of this kerfuffle would happen if we had a common banking system , foreign policy , army , etc. 
  sad to think my country has no social liberal party i can vote for . 
  you should n't be . 
  britain would be banking on that trade surplus just like germany is . 
  an `` artificially '' devalued currency would be fanastic for the uk . 
  that 's complete bullshit . 
  direct representation is awful , especially for human rights/minorities and in no way is the eu anything like the soviet union . 
  we would have far worse consumer rights without it , trade would be a mess , the southern states would have no investment , etc. 
  the eu was the best thing that happened to us . 
  it 's usually beneficial for poor , corrupt countries even if we shoot ourselves in the foot over and over again . 
  are you serious ? 
  go on any immigration thread you 'll be bombarded with ukippers and other nationalists . 
  i checked and you 're correct actually , my mistake . 
  after 3 years of negative growth ( -4 % wow ) we 've grown 0.9 % this year , same as the euro zone . 
  no he obviously does not . 
  false dichotomy and an ad hominem , nice two fallacies with one stone there . 
  his argument is sound and you probably have n't read the article as you ca n't possibly disagree on macroeconomic facts . 
  expresso is a newspaper and the author is a well known economist . 
  command + f `` lenin '' . 
  not really , you 're a bit confused . 
  conservatives are just right wing , they can be libertarian or authoritarian . 
  same as socialists , they can be libertarian or authoritarian . 
  liberalism is a complete other ballgame , it usually refers to the political centre of socially progressive and economically legit ideologies . 
  cds are actually less in favour of austerity measures as psd are , for example . 
  they 're christian democrats meaning they 're not socially progressive but they still have a lot of left wing policies , putting them sort of at an authoritarian centre . 
  they 're more in favour of keeping pensions and helping the poor than psd are at the moment . 
  point 6 . http://www.pcp.pt/programa-do-pcp, 
  be is * not * social-liberal op , nor is livre . 
  the former is marxist the latter is socialist . 
  mpt is [ social liberal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ) . 
  we actually have . 
  finally some sense in this thread . 
  we 're growing below eurozone average , still poorer than 5 years ago and unemployment has increased . 
  not to mention that oil prices have plummeted and the euro was devalued , and we 're still breaking debt-level records . 
  if anyone is interested to read in portuguese , psd massively failed on all macroeconomic indices . 
  http://expresso.sapo.pt/blogues/bloguet_economia/blogue_econ_alexandre_abreu/2015-09-30-o-fim-do-pesadelo i 'm not saying ps were any better but psd managed to increase debt to record levels , reducing it was their sole direct objective when implementing austerity . 
  psd tanked the country too . 
  people do n't vote based on facts . 
  cds are n't as right wing as this psd is at the moment . 
  this is not true . 
  cdu is leninist , take your pick . 
  your english does n't make too much sense , i do n't really understand what you 're saying sorry . 
  100.000 people is 1 % of our population , which would be unsustainable . 
  again , for the whole eu , if migrants are distributed well it 's not problematic . 
  jesus get over yourself . 
  https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/in_detail#myanchor2  if you think portugal is one of the most corrupt countries in the world i never said that . 
  you 're arguing with yourself here . 
  well , migrant intake will have to be reduced while refugees are processed sustainably . 
  does n't really matter where they 're from , literally all of syria could migrate to the eu and it would n't increase the population by 1 % .
