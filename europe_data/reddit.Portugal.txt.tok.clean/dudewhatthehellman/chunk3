  however , they are divorced and jaime is no longer a member of the royal family . 
  she * did * study at exeter but i ca n't vouch for what people call her . 
  with regards to her son , joy has a light soir\u00e9e just like every other club in spain that is for underage . 
  i assume that 's where he worked but if not that is indeed stupid on everyone 's part . 
  also botswana does n't have a king . 
  i still do n't think that makes a case for ( male preference ) cognatic primogeniture . 
  [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/line_of_succession_to_the_spanish_throne ) , it seems the infantas abdicated any pretension to the throne and the law will be changed as soon as don felipe has a son . 
  ah i see , well that should be changed obviously . 
  source ? 
  you only have to look across the border to know a parliamentary republic does n't work in countries with problems regarding corruption . 
  ( same with italy where it 's more expensive and yet another source of corruption ) . 
  i 'm liberal and federalist but there really is n't a better alternative to a secular monarchy if we are to have a ceremonial leader . 
   in its crown the male has preference over the female , but also says that are men equal in rights to women . 
  not true , next in line to be monarch is felipe 's eldest daughter . 
  still cheaper than a republic .

  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10862999/us-economy-goes-into-reverse-as-fears-grow-over-recovery.html ), 
  oh god , i 've specifically said that they did n't directly cause the eu crisis . 
  are you reading something i 'm not writing ? 
  they caused the financial crisis which contributed massively to the world recession . 
  this is what rocard is saying . 
  there are financial incentives to create economic `` disorder '' . 
  that 's it . 
  and yes the developed world [ * is * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) in recession or lower than average growth at the moment . 
  a ) financial crisis + b ) eurozone crisis = c ) world recession ( of which we are still in as i linked you ) cause of a ) us + uk financial institutions therefore , factor of c ) = uk financial institutions . 
  * obviously * there is a vested interest in selling high risk derivatives as low risk . 
  i do n't think i can spell it out for you any clearer . 
  portugal , spain and greece 's issues were entirely unrelated to the euro/eu . 
  they were/are internal structural issues mainly linked with corruption . 
  the financial crisis on the other hand was created by investment banks , of which london has the biggest hub in europe/the world . 
  this happened [ in 2008 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308 ) this , along with the eurozone crisis , which is a seperate thing that happened [ in 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_sovereign_debt_crisis ) and other factors , led to the current '' [ great recession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession ) '' . 
  so yes , the uk is partly responsible for economic recession the world is currently observing . 
  and the city has come out better than it was before so obviously there is a vested interest from the financial world in creating profitable situations like these , which are not what countries want . 
  this is what he was saying and it 's correct . 
  thermal solar power does work at night , especially when using salts . 
  when denmark has wind , so does germany . . 
  anyway , the solution is there , it 's the country that ca n't take advantage of it . 
  financial disorder , along with the us yes they did , look at what happened to northern rock , lloyds , etc. 
  this affected the world 's financial state and therefore the euro . 
  * geothermal [ is n't as experimental ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geothermal_energy#economics ) as you make it seem , it really is worth exploiting more . 
  * as for solar and wind , have you seen the newest episode of cosmos ? 
  the fact that they 're expensive in portugal is n't the technology 's fault . 
  thermal solar power does n't have the intermittency issues of regular pv cells . 
  wind has a [ lower capacity factor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermittent_energy_source#terminology ) of course but they should all be used together , so really it 's not that much of a problem i do n't think . 
  * gen iv nuclear plants can actually [ use nuclear waste as fuel ] ( http://gizmodo.com/5990383/the-future-of-nuclear-power-runs-on-the-waste-of-our-nuclear-past ) . 
  that was creepy . 
   maybe take a page out of merkel 's book maybe not . 
  `` the economy of the eu would fall '' ? 
  what does that even mean , that all the other countries in europe would become bankrupt because the uk decided to leave or would the eu as an institution have less funds ? 
  i want the uk to leave because it 's clearly not in the uk 's plans to become part of a federal europe , which is the point of the eu . 
  we 'll do just fine without the uk , on the other hand , the uk might not be able to say the same thing . 
  as in why do i think they will or why do i want them to ? 
  yet another reason for you to leave , fantastic . 
  it 's very clear that the uk does n't want the eu and i 'm perfectly ok with that . 
  yeah you might vote to stay unfortunately . 
  hear that , farage ? 
  no no no , it 's okay . 
  that 's a good argument for further political unification . 
  there is [ at least gas ] ( http://www.publico.pt/ciencias/jornal/os-vulcoes-de-lama-do-golfo-de-cadis-e-as-ameijoas-gigantes-que-la-vivem-26022174#/0 ) off our coast and it 's pretty much [ given that oil exists . 
  ] ( http://www.psd-algarve.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=219&amp;catid=1:noticias&amp;itemid=11 ) i know alqueva was 70 years too late but that 's no reason to not take advantage of it . 
  we still have wind , solar , wave production and if we can change that stupid law , nuclear since [ we have reserves ] ( http://publico.pt/ciencia/noticia/investigadores-analisam-residuos-das-minas-de-uranio-portuguesas-1162177 ) . 
  like you said , untapped geothermal in a\u00e7ores too . 
  and yeah , the eez is just sitting there waiting to make us all rich but we do n't do anything with it . 
  i think we should form a party and take this into our own hands , what do you say ? 
  lol, 
  [ p\u00fablico then . 
  yeah , was n't there a massive scandal in portugal because the ins data was wrong ? 
  and a comparison of the two . 
  saberdzneti and yunanistan are personal favourites . 
  [ porto is one of the poorest counties . 
  ] ( http://jpn.c2com.up.pt/2007/10/16/distrito_do_porto_25_a_30_da_populacao_e_pobre.html ) i was comparing \u00c9vora to its latitude-equivalent and county-equivalent coastline which is n't algarve but the litoral alentejano/costa vicentina which is obviously much poorer . 
  * no natural resources ? 
  there 's plenty of [ oil and gas off the coast of algarve . 
  ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/repsol-assina-contrato-de-exploracao-de-petroleo-e-gas-no-algarve-na-proxima-sextafeira-1517334 ) we have europe 's only deep-sea port ( sines ) , europe 's biggest artificial lake with a massive dam ( alqueva ) , the entire tejo valley , incredibly fertile ground ( alentejo ) , lots of hydroelectric potential in the north , the 10th largest eez in the entire world , the a\u00e7ores islands ( geothermal and scientific haven ) etc. 
  * our population is [ becoming well educated ] ( http://gpseducation.oecd.org/countryprofile?primarycountry=prt&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=eo ) believe it or not , we just ca n't retain it like you say so there 's something we could do . 
   state actively discourages private investment and new businesses . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i did n't know the state did this , i know it 's impossible to get capital in portugal at the moment though but we still have [ a good environment for start-ups ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/lisbon-s-heart-is-in-san-francisco-style-startups.html ) . 
  * absurdly slow and ineffective justice . 
  agreed , so we need to reform it yesterday . 
  * high taxes ... 23 % corporate tax is n't bad at all , but the vat is too high yes . 
   how ? 
  it 's not that difficult , it 's called supply-side reform . 
  [ michael porter told us what to do step by step in 1994 and the results were obvious ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/portugal-precisa-de-um-novo-relatorio-porter-que-aponte-os-caminhos-da-reindustrializacao-1586584 ) . 
  we need that again . 
  but obviously , [ our socialist governments has kept any chance of that happening well hidden ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/michael-porter-arrasa-sete-anos-socialistas-130570 ) ( see the date on that ) . 
  the issue here , in my opinion , is that a republic [ does n't propose an improved alternative ] ( http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/opinion/why-the-arguments-for-a-republic-are-an-insult-to-the-intelligence-31835 ) ( i do n't agree with the title of that article by the way but with the general content ) . 
  monarchies such as spain 's rely on democratic approval and are subject to change to a republic if the people want . 
  also if you think about it , the country would n't exist had it not been for the particular ancestor of the monarch . 
  that 's not a reason on it 's own but it supports why it should be that particular person and not another to be carry the burden of being the head of state . 
  no worries . 
  i mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-clericalism#portugal ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_october_1910_revolution#anticlericalism ) . 
  it was very healthy in my view to separate church and state . 
  no such thing as religious oaths , religious tax exemption , preferential treatments , etc. 
  which i think would have taken longer had the monarchy survived . 
  in recent years more monarchies are de-establishing religions from state functions like for example in [ sweden ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/01/local/me-49706 ) and the netherlands but with a vocal and strong minority of portuguese people being catholic , i doubt that our monarchy would have done that in the beginning of the 20th century . 
  fun fact : the monarchy was ousted in a terrorist act by freemasons without public support ( i think only something like 7 % wanted a republic at the time ) as the king was [ very popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_i_of_portugal ) and known for his academic prowess and humility . 
  you can see pictures of the `` rebels '' parading [ carbon\u00e1ria flags .
