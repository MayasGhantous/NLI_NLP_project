  eventually you 'll end up like the uk where fees are # 18,000 !, 
  or even the us which is ridiculous . 
   the chief surgeon 's children will get education anway since their parents are well off , but it would be unfair to deprive the nurse 's children of access to education for lack of funds . 
  this is exactly what they mean . 
  it still does n't make sense because taxation wo n't decrease , but it is their reasoning . 
  wow , okay , i always thought western europe had a higher gdp per capita and quality of life than the us , is that incorrect ? 
  says a lot about you . 
  not anymore , [ the purity is increasing and the price is decreasing ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ceuqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.slate.com%2farticles%2fnews_and_politics%2fexplainer%2f2012%2f04%2fcheap_cocaine_why_are_coke_prices_going_down_.html&amp;ei=r5egu9zjfakq0qwtv4ggba&amp;usg=afqjcng41ywpv3e-whayypqnanyhumm98g&amp;sig2=gqpvtub5tsuzgksloxg--g&amp;bvm=bv.67720277,d.d2k ) thanks to the efforts of prohibition . 
  cocaine morphed from being the drug of the upper-middle class in the 90 's to becoming your average joe 's naughty habit in the 2000 's . 
  well said . 
  reality check . 
  this is not true , mdma is ahead of cocaine as the main illegal stimulant in the uk with tobacco being the highest and caffeine on the same level as md. 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/last-12-months-drug-prevalence.pdf ) and in portugal , mdma is higher than cuh-caine , too . 
  they 're ( we 're ) vastly inefficient compared to the nice countries , yes . 
  before someone comments on the site this is coming from , they provide sources for every claim . 
  homeopathy is by definition not the use of natural remedies in a traditional , effective medicinal way . 
  it 's quackery . 
  you do n't have to believe in `` holistic vitality '' in order to know that certain naturally occurring substances are effective in treatment while diluting them to molecularly insignificant amounts and relying on water memory is complete bollocks . 
  for sure but the way it 's looking none of the richer countries want any part of it , which incidently is putin 's , obama 's and china 's wet dream . 
  pj is n't the same as undercover psp . 
  [ in portuguese . 
  * controversial ( and frankly hideous and unsustainable ) dense urbanisation plan for carcavelos ( near cascais ) approved . 
  * lisbon 's mayor officially candidates himself for leader of the socialist party ( centre-left ) . 
  * 92 % of portuguese beaches have water rated as `` excellent '' . 
  * regular police tow away secret police car while on an operation . 
  * rock in rio allowed to not pay taxes ( $ 2.9 million ) after threatening to move from a certain `` borough '' . 
  * media reporting influx of research chemicals ( they just do n't know they 're called that and say new drugs in portugal !! 1 ! 1one ! ), 
  as the second coming of satan . 
  * $ 30 billion worth of tax evasion estimated to be in swiss coffers . 
  * renewables subsidy to be put into place again but this time at a smaller 15 million a year as opposed to 60 million a year * debt interest maintains downward tendency, 
  neo-classical liberalism , not regular social liberalism . 
  thank fuck for the eu . 
  even if we ditch the rich countries , i think us poorer countries can form a pretty awesome country . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  homeopathy \u2260 natural remedies . 
  he 's a teacher at one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the entire world , but do n't let that stop ukip supporters from chatting shit about him . 
  mostly wine though , while they drink heavier amounts of beer and spirits . 
  `` keep those facts away !! '', 
   the problem with this statistic , and it gets published a lot , is that this is just the net total . 
  so there 're going to be people who are net contributors and people who are net receivers . 
  ukip 's argument is that we should n't let people in who are net receivers , so publishing this one frequently is n't going to counter their argument . 
  it still means that the uk can sustainably intake immigrants , so it disproves ukip 's rhetoric . 
   technically , no we did n't . 
  we voted to join the eec . 
  main aim of the eec : `` preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of europe '' . 
  essentially the eec 's main aim was to become the eu , the uk voted yes to this . 
   paying india # 280m a year whilst they are spending huge sums of money on their space programme shows a lack of priority by their government . 
  what . 
  so we should n't invest in art/science until everyone is well off ? 
  a country like india who 's economy has a large reliance on innovation [ only benefits from having a space programme . 
  ] ( http://www.space.com/15310-nasa-budget-future-space-exploration.html )  the problem is , what people consider to be fraudulent behaviour is n't classed as being by the system so ? 
  yes fraud needs to be tackled , everyone agrees on that except anarchists . 
  i 'm sorry but the points you make are few and far between considering how many arguments are made . 
  i 'd be happy to read your rebuttal but honestly you do n't seem to have disproven a single thing . 
  oh you mean neo-classical liberalism . 
  you should just say libertarian to avoid confusion . 
  calm down mate that 's not what anyone is implying . 
  they 're apologising for having voted for a known xenophobic populist far right party which is quite frankly , rather embarrassing . 
  this is not to say they 'd rather not have elections . 
  25 % of 43 % is 10.7 % so it 's actually still a very small minority but you have to consider the other parties got even less than that . 
  man i really hope scotland give `` little england '' the middle finger and become a scandinavian-model country . 
  they have so much to gain , they already have free education and a higher gdp-per capita . 
  this is one of the good things i see from this election . 
  people are finally going to start exposing the anti-eu rhetoric for the baseless populism that it is . 
  where did you get the data for this ? 
  that 's an equally stupid thing to say . 
  it has been empirically proven that far-right parties attract the working class so it 's a fair assumption for him to make . 
  nationalism , chauvinism , xenophobia , racism and reactionarism do n't bode well with the educated simply because they 're logical fallacies . 
  ah yes , appeal to authority . 
  how your years of wisdom have made your arguments so coherent . . 
  as much as i hate pp , i hate psoe even more . 
  spanish politics is truly fucked outside catalonia/basque country . 
  weirdly enough , those two regions have the more sensible centrist parties . 
   eu-hugging super state-friendly party . 
  this does not imply they can not be liberal . 
  alde is the most pro-european party . 
  [  as proved by the fact their lives went happily on while they ignored the election . 
  ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly4rerv8ot1qjj9spo1_250.gif ), 
  i sure hope not . 
  i think you 're confusing an individual the public can relate to with a demagogue . 
  lib dems have more than one policy you know . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i know they 're more likely to vote but i never thought that denmark had any significant level of nationalism . 
  it 's scary seeing them fall to populism . 
  disgusting , really . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.acgrayling.com/the-last-word-on-nationalism ) a good piece by a.c. grayling on the fallacy of nationalism . 
  ok i 'm sorry i should 've rephrased that mr. wittgenstein . 
  the democratic * privilege * to vote . 
  vvd and d66 are members of alde , i checked their wiki and vvd seem relatively social liberal too but i 'm sure being dutch you would know better . 
  i do n't understand the difference between the two though . 
  because you do n't use your democratic right to vote . 
  how is any of the shit happening in your country the eu 's fault ? 
  ( centre left and centre right , respectively ), 
  upyd are liberals , right ? 
  like ceu ? 
  why did the liberals do as badly as the fascists ? 
  16 % is criminal you should get sanctions or something for that almost . 
  yeah exactly that too . 
  it 's just all the more ridiculous consider romania is n't a breeding ground for delinquents .
