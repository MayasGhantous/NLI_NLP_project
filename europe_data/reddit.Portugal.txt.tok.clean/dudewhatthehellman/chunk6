  well you have two social-liberal parties vvd and d66 right ? 
  what ? 
  one of the most liberal nations on earth . . 
  thank you for that !, 
  yeah it 's quite bad . 
  people do n't realise romania is a normal country . 
  their members are racist . 
  why is mpt ridiculed in portugal ? 
  i 'm sorry but in the uk and france it 's all they ever talk about , the `` dangers '' of having romanians and bulgarians come . 
  the policy for immigrants coming from outside of the eu has n't changed . 
  they are also [ racist . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10388725/front-national-member-calls-french-justice-minister-a-monkey.html ), 
  it has been empirically verified that that is [ not the case ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/myth_european.pdf ) , do n't worry . 
   multiculturalism is a naive and dangerous concept !, 
  it 's not your attitude to immigration that gets you called a racist , it 's comments like those . 
  anyway , europe has closed borders to those outside of it , intra-eu immigration is only ever beneficial economically and socially . 
  i just hope the centre rises in france as an answer . 
   it 's amazing to watch this as an american because it feels like europe is 200 years behind us when it comes to racial progression . 
  joke of the century , right here . 
  paris is particularly bad due to its lack of social integration ( la banlieu ghettos ) but the rest of europe is centuries ahead of the us , just look at what happened with slavery and equal rights . 
  ukip do n't vote in the eu . 
  confusingly , the liberals in germany are more classical liberals ( more like ukip but not as extreme ) than social liberals . 
  usually the word liberal in europe is reserved for social liberalism , not classical liberalism . 
  i think cdu , again confusingly , are more like social liberals . 
  however , fdp is part of alde which rejects neo-liberal economics , so there you have it . 
  what parties say they do and what they actually do seems to be quite different . 
  congratulations to the german people for having kept out the extremes . 
  politics 101, 
  you define democratic deficit as voter turnout in european elections ? 
  read my article . 
   `` the result of this analysis is unambiguous : across nearly every measureable dimension , the eu is at least as democratic , and generally more so , than its mem - ber states . '', 
  `` nick griffin says bnp is not racist '' [ here 's a good article explaining why ukip are indeed racist . 
  ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100268508/ukip-are-worse-than-the-bnp-at-least-nick-griffin-has-the-courage-of-his-racist-convictions/ ) in essence : actions speak louder than words . 
  i was thinking about this today . 
  we need someone to engage the public on all the benefits we get from being part of a union . 
  most people do n't understand anything that goes on in the eu and to be honest i do n't blame them , there 's a lot of confusing legislation and the structure is n't simple either . 
  it 's very easy to lash out on a `` eu is literally the devil '' rhetoric and get a bunch of votes simply because most people are uninformed . 
  big congratulations , this makes me very happy !, 
  both are [ myths ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/myth_european.pdf ) propagated by populist parties , just so you know . 
  so well ? 
  so badly !, 
  i ca n't believe liberals only got around 15 % of the vote with the extremists at 13 % . 
  no because he 's anti non-white 's , anti multiculturalism and promotes hate speech . 
  yes it is , yet it 's the 3rd party in the netherlands in terms of european elections . 
  crazy !, 
   if you really want to stop the brain drain from poorer to richer countries , what you need to do is to offer the suitable conditions for those brains to flourish in their own countries . 
  it ought not to be so difficult , but you would have to deal with all the vested interests and extractive elites [ 1 ] holding back our countries , which regard anything that rewards merit as a threat to their own privileges and nepotism . 
  and that is a very tall order . 
  this is portugal 's entire problem socially , politically and economically , and you managed to sum it up in one paragraph , thanks . 
  the man is [ basically a modern day hitler ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-politician-geert-wilders-leads-supporters-in-antimoroccan-chant-9206211.html ) . 
  have we already forgotten the perils of populist scapegoatist racism ? 
  37 % is such a poor turnout . 
  let 's calm down with the racist fallacies people . 
  philosophy 101 : [ principle of induction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/problem_of_induction ) . 
  just because n ^ 1 has these characteristics , does n't mean n ^ 2 will have them consequently . 
  fallacy : [ hasty generalisation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasty_generalisation ), 
  so because they want it to be asymmetrical , it will become symmetrical ? 
  [ europe is richer . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transatlantic_trade_and_investment_partnership#background ) the us stands to gain $ 59 billion dollars more per year than the eu . 
  they have more to gain than we do , i understand your point , but decreasing consumer rights would go against the very basic tennants of the eu . 
  the something in return is economic gains for both parties , that 's it . 
  countries are n't private enterprises . 
  i do n't understand why they ca n't come up with a fta treaty that leaves out anything coercive on copyright , loss of national sovereignty and anything related to decreased consumer rights and goods standards . 
  it 's lke every single time legislators go : `` oh hey i 've got an idea , let 's lower trade costs '' and everyone seems happy and then they think `` but first let me make some legislation to fuck everyone over , for shits and gigs . 
  who knows , maybe i 'll get a job in the sector i lobby for if i can get this through '' . 
  a little bit of common fucking sense please . 
  that 's a good read , thanks . 
  essentially the national governments do n't seem to have enough democratic legitimacy according to karras and therefore need the more democratic , eu parliament to step in . 
   portugal i do n't see the connection between the eu 's democratic transparency and the falling birth rate in portugal , sorry . 
  seems like a correlation like any other . 
   spain oh wow , i did n't know about that , that 's horrible on pp 's part . 
  again though i fail to see a connection with the democratic transparency of the eu . 
  in fact , i see that the eu is much more democratic than spain . 
   greece   greece would n't pull such extraordinary measures ; break charter ( of fundamental rights ) , without extraordinary external pressure . 
  you just mentioned the charter , which was made by the eu itself . 
  also , i do n't believe in extreme neo-liberal austerity either but to say the institution of the eu is to blame for something that was written in greece 's constitution 192 years ago is a bit of a stretch . 
  regardless , that law exists in every country . 
  you mean the emmigration out of portugal ? 
  just so you know the crisis in portugal was caused due to internal corruption and supply side inefficiencies , completely unrelated to the eu . 
  without the eu , portugal would be in even worse state . 
  in addition , birth rates have always been low there in recent history . 
  so yeah , nothing new and completely unrelated to the eu 's `` democratic deficit '' , free movement has actually made it easier for people to find jobs , settle and for example vote in their host countries . 
  you provided nothing for the claim about spain ? 
  i understand the situation in greece is far worse than anywhere else but according to their constitution  under greek law , the government can forcibly mobilize workers in the case of civil disorder , natural disasters or health risks to the public . 
  i do n't see how that is related to the eu as an institution nor how that is a bad thing . 
  if they want to change their constitution , they can . 
   be it forced labor in greece , criminalization of the protest in spain , demographic implosion in portugal i do n't understand any of these things , i 've seen more protests than i can think of in spain and what even are the other two ? 
  considering what happened , can you blame them ? 
  you mean in hungary or something ? 
  this is the eu as an institution , not the entire union of countries itself . 
  what ? 
  exactly . 
  co2 + reef destruction vs. cheap , efficient , secure and independent energy . 
  sounds like a no-brainer to me . 
  plus , invest a bit more to get a thorium reactor and nuclear waste is n't even a problem in the long term . 
  no arguments left for `` hippies '' there . 
  romanians get the blame because many gypsies involved in crime have romanian passports . 
  this [ bbc documentary - gypsy child thieves ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1c8ww9_gypsy-child-thieves-bbc-documentary_news ) really highlights the vast network of theft and human traffic that a large proportion of roma people are involved in ( it also shows the exceptional cases of those that break out of it ) . 
  i am by no means saying that if you are a gypsy you are immediatly born into a life of crime , however , the roma culture has evolved to spawn a very high proportion of its population that takes to crime .
