  yeah it seems you 're right , since july of last year , i did n't know . 
  as for your second point , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
   inferiority complex . 
  sounds like bitch talk to me . 
  but seriously , i do n't think such a thing exists . 
  lux would be inferior to belgium -  netherlands -  germany -  uk -  us -  freedoms it 's nonsensical , a country 's size is n't a measure of it 's success . 
  belgium has plenty of better things than the netherlands or france and vice versa . 
  lgbt marriage !, 
  in reality though , women have less opportunities here and lgbt adoption is n't legal . 
  i hate ps but one thing they do well is bring up those topics to be discussed in parliament . 
  currently , i do n't see psd agreeing to any of it . 
  they 've become far too retrograde . 
  true that , but that came out of nowhere , it 's not really a representation of our country 's politics unfortunately . 
  our constitution kicks ass but the sheer amount of corruption destroys any hope of ever becoming a properly developed nation in my lifetime . 
  we 're ahead of you in equal rights , too . 
  but far behind on economic and political legislation . 
  1/10th of them are . 
  it 's a special case though , i think 1/3 of the country is portuguese if i 'm not mistaken . 
  goes to prove we just need a good government to have a decent country . 
  spanish education is fairly shit . 
  our education is pretty much free too . 
  and their ( your ) glorious pension money . 
  what ? 
  this is fucking ludicrous !, 
  are we the us government 's little bitch ? 
  why does china insist on being a global asshole ? 
  awesome . 
  portugal is beautiful although i 'd hesitate to say porto is a better place to visit than a lot of places in europe , which are also very beautiful . 
  you have plenty of reasons to be proud , belgium is a great place . 
  we are about 30 years behind these countries though , lest we forget . 
  look i 'm not trying to be an asshole here , but if you watch that bbc documentary it shows how the nomadic roma are by and large involved in crime . 
  it also shows examples of some that have managed to escape and contribute to society albeit a small minority . 
  this is fact . 
  what you said is just an attempt at being a smart alec . 
   ironically enough , many european countries engage in far more spying on their own citizens and have fewer oversight or regulatory mechanisms in place than the us does . 
  have you got a good source on that ? 
   they can repeal any law the parliament passes . 
  which goes back to parliament to be passed . . 
  genuine question : can you give me an example of a `` terrible destructive policies that are against the interest of the ordinary people '' that would not have passed if the eu was `` more democratic '' ? 
  thank you for this , a lot of people get hung up on the ` eu is n't democratic ' rhetoric , particularly in the uk . 
  corn is a [ human creation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-e67xefja ) , i 'm not bothered . 
  hopefully we can reduce pesticide use with this . 
  however , if it follows the line of monsanto 's patent trolling then they can fuck right off . 
  in europe our freedom of speech is n't unlimited . 
  you 're not allowed to incite hatred , for example , and i guess they interpreted this as that . 
  personally , i think it 's misguided criticism , it a historically correct statement . 
  [ gypsies do steal * almost * universally . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-e67xefja ) the difference between comparing gypsies to other nationalities is that they are actually organised into a huge crime scheme . 
  til , thanks . 
  you should be one to know what ps has done . 
  i 'm only rustling your republican jimmies , 
  that 's what happens when you get left leaning comunidades !, 
  edit : jesus christ , calm down reddit . 
  the socialist parties in [ portugal ] ( http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/henrique-neto-ps-com-socrates-favoreceu-corrupcao-1379111 ) and [ spain ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1603039/0/alcaldes/corrupcion/imputados/ ) are both known to be [ corrupt ] ( http://wiki.15m.cc/wiki/lista_de_pol%c3%adticos_condenados ) , even more so than pp in spain for example , especially at the local governance level . 
  i 'm sorry if the truth hurts . 
  hahahahaha, 
  thanks, 
  thanks for the heads up . . 
  damn . . you guys are fuuucked . 
  yeah we have a big brain-drain in portugal too . 
  sucks . 
  that 's sad to hear . 
  what 's wrong with limburg ? 
  [ good documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmixrerxfc ) on the mafia behind gypsies , it 's really horrible . 
  so is a communist past the main reason ? 
  i highly recommend it , cheap and super developed . 
  doing very well too , judging from the constantly full restaurants in ljubljana . 
  ljubljana and piran were two highlights , the former being very artsy and lively whilst the latter is simply beautiful and unspoilt . 
  much cleaner than italy and more developed than croatia . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  fantastic , makes me really want to go there and wonder why the uk made such a fuss about immigration . 
  any reasons as to why it 's so poor and has such a bad reputation in other countries ? 
  do n't see where you can deduce that from . 
  wow, 
  west progressive , east russia/corruption leaning ? 
  according to the bbc , the uk plans to exit the eu if they 're forced to joined the euro ( like every other country ) . 
  * oh britain . . *, 
  * oh britain * . . 
  portugal had 58.3 % renewable electricity but it was more expensive than in nordic countries, 
  hey , can i just ask who in their right mind put forward this legislation ? 
  gracias tio , i 'll use this as a template , 
  ** portugal ** - fuck all . 
  - lisbon tube introduces closures one day a week in protest of cuts - constitutional court fails attempt to converge pensions and reduce them by 10 % citing a breach of the principle of confidence - 120,000 portuguese people emigrated this year - unemployment decreases 1.2 % over the summer months ( cyclical obviously ) - wages drop by the biggest amount in the oecd , as does productivity - economic activity reaches its maximum since april 2011 - 6 teenagers died after being taken by a wave during university hazing ( praxe ), 
  . . with dat torque, 
  8th and 12th actually , we got our independance in 1139 . 
  islam is not the religion/culture of europe , albania and bosnia are unquestionably in the continent geographically , however they are both small countries whos muslim population accounts for a tiny fraction of the whole european population . 
  turkey on the other hand is a huge country with much more conservatively muslim people . 
  despite the secularism imposed by ataturk , they 're becoming much more radical and this is something that the eu can not allow . 
  not to mention what they did in cyprus and armenia in recent times . 
  yep . . 
  source ? 
  portugal used to be better off than spain but still very poor . 
  yeah . 
  seems pretty irrelevant now . 
  someone 's got issues . 
  so many man are you kidding ? 
  laine is quite cool . 
  allemanic by the portuguese and spanish too . 
  ` germany ' actually only refers to one particular tribe , the germani . 
  proud .
