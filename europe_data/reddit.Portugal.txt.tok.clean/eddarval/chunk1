the madeira island is in africa and 2 islands of azores are in the american continental plate, 
  well , portugal is also partly in africa and america . 
  iceland is also partly in america . 
  france is all over the place . 
  not saying i mind seeing turkey related stuff . 
  to me they 're as european as cyprus ( which is completely in asia ) . 
  just pointing out that he 's right . 
  turkey is mostly not a european nation . 
  again , / r/europe not / r/europeanaffairs i do n't think there 's a `` for news regarding european policy only '' unless i missed anything . 
  may we be blessed with visions of her bosom . 
  ca n't you say the same about a lot of things in this sub ? 
  it 's europe . 
  everything that happens in europe is kind of relevant to this sub . 
  otherwise it should be called / r/europeanaffairs, 
  to be fair ... you asked . 
  even the summer is leaving the south and going to scandinavia ... 
  that 's because there 's no crime if there 's no body !, 
  i 'd love to even have a unlimited available , but there 's not even one in sight . 
  can we revive our empires ? 
  imagine a mix of roman , spanish and portuguese empires !, 
  we would rule the world !!, 
  ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ were ^ ^ ^ able ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ pay ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ army , ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ is !, 
  wait ... 
  unlimited data for 14 $ ? 
  i pay 30 $ for 1gb and free calls . 
  one would think that the economic policies of the british dude who helped the us and uk leave the great depression would still be upheld a few 70 years later . 
  who would have guessed that politicians do n't know their history ? 
  ( or their economics ), 
  i think he means `` they do n't have an army marching through europe '', 
  i lived in northern spain for about 6 months . 
  saying that spain and portugal are very similar culturally is about right . 
  there 's something i should be expecting but did n't thought . 
  [ this ] ( http://photos.void7.com/images/10_6841.jpg ) is the pavement of streets in portugal . 
  as in , every street of portugal is paved like this . 
  from the main avenue to the nameless alley . 
  the pavement everywhere else is not . 
  which is more practical , and easy to fix , but less pretty . 
  i fine , long , fat baguette . 
  and now i 'm hungry . 
  it 's a mediterranean stereotype , 
  oviedo london berlin athens paris, 
  i meant `` everyone and their mothers '' as in the influential political factions majority of the population knows that either psd/cds ( government parties ) or ps ( main opposition party ) would do exactly the same thing and the rest are just not an option . 
  we 're in a fucked if you do , fucked if you do n't kind of situation . 
  and to be honest , if the government falls , i can see them getting elected again . 
  this bothers me to no end ... middle east is part of asia and scandinavia is part of europe !, 
  new government cuts , the pm is making so many compliments to the coalition partner it 's starting to become embarrassing . 
  sun next week ( huzzah ) . 
  coalition partner to talk about the new cuts today . 
  unions being unions . 
  everyone and their mothers who are not in the government wants the government to fall after the local elections this year , the pm said , `` naaaaah '', 
  there 's several cities that elected as mayor people who have been proven to be corrupt . 
  the justification ? 
  `` they steal like everyone else [ politicians ] , but at least they give back to the people '' the last one got arrested a few days ago , but he 's still the mayor of oeiras , the municipality with more business headquarters in the country . 
  so that 's a thing ... 
  does anyone know the price of an air plain ticket from lisbon to stockholm ? 
  xungas in the south, 
  do n't get upset man . 
  have you seen the people we 've elected recently ? 
  yeah and it 's also very disturbing . 
  as a citizen of a country that before 2009 was a region of spain for everyone including europeans , i feel your pain fellow czechs, 
  have you seen the 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns ? 
  thats reassuring ... 
  it 's one of the longest constitutions around with stuff that makes no sense existing . 
  adding to what / u/rjtavares said : regarding electronic information : giving every citizen of the country a number is unconstitutional , yet we have now a citizens card that everyone is forced to have that takes our biometric info and stores it in government servers . 
  this is just my pet peeve , there 's plenty of stuff like this . 
  yes a human being just died , let 's have a party ... 
  the decision by the constitutional court wo n't affect the program of the government in the slightest . 
  they 'll work over the weekend to present an image that they are committed to figure this out and in a few days they will present the parliament with one of the following : - meeting with troika ( damn it i hate this word ) to increase the leverage on the budget ; - rectified budget to cover the cut the constitutional court gave the original budget which will more than likely imply more cuts on the expenses . 
  i do n't believe they will increase the taxes in the overall population , but i 've been wrong before . 
  truth be told , this `` political crisis '' is to political crisis as a zoo is to a broadway show . 
  this is just to keep us entertained . 
  in the end nothing will change because nothing can change . 
  : i 'm not being cynical here regarding this crap , i just think that this issue is bigger than the parties , the portuguese government and to a degree even the eu . 
  just my 0.02 $, 
  and thought we make a lot of hunger jokes because of the late xx century famine , they are still a major power in the region . 
  semantics matter !, 
  well cuba was partly colonized . 
  you ... yes , i like you and the way you think . 
  ethiopia was never a colony per se . 
  it was conquered , but not colonized . 
   and a funny thing happened to you in this thread : you have been played by the two guys posting above you . 
  exactly why i do n't know dafuq is happening, 
  never read anything by that site, 
  let me see if i get this straight . 
  western europe is the heart of the union , as in , ireland , uk , france , spain and portugal ? 
  but hungary is a peripheral nation like say , greece , italy , spain , portugal and ireland and like hungary they are not at the heart of the union ? 
  that would leave only france and the uk being western europe and not peripheral as the heart of the union . 
  i 'm sorry , but for me , every nation of the eu is at the heart of the eu . 
  so this article was sensationalist ? 
  since may 1st 2004 when it entered the union ... 
  at least you still have them on court rooms . 
  we put ours on the tv screen . 
  mirror mirror on the wall ... 
  how the hell did this happen in the heart of the eu ? 
  or is this over sensationalized ? 
  do n't worry . 
  i 'm sure it wont blow in your face !, 
  he 's portuguese, 
  let me put it like this : if we said the first quarter we 'd be saying `` o primeiro quarto '' which translates to the first room . 
  and if we said the first quarter of the year it would be `` o primeiro quarto do ano '' which again , translates to the first room of the year .
