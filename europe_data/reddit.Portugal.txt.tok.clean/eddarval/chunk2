  meanwhile we divide the hour because saying quarter of an hour comes as `` quarto de hora '' there 's a big difference between do/da and de, 
  because in portuguese we never say quarter for anything but time . 
  everything else is based on the actual number . 
  you should be able to read portuguese and hop into / r/portugal you 'd have a blast !, 
  brb getting a ticket to oslo ... 
  a funny article is bashing ? 
  besides , it 's amazing we do n't have more russian stories , them being the biggest country in the world and being pretty much mostly focused in europe and all . 
  can anyone find an american based journal with an article not claiming the euro is about to collapse ? 
  i really do n't get it . 
  the eu is lending money to countries that need it because elected officials robbed said countries , and because said money has strings attached they are the bad guys ? 
  i agree that the euro implementation was sloppy at best , but who implemented the euro were the same guys who ruined countries by debt . 
  how come the organisations that are now willing to help are the bad guys ? 
  ca n't the same be said for us ? 
  i mean , everyone is watching the damn national team right now . 
  fuck football ... just sayin . 
  i 'll join you and i 'll bring food ... it is going to be a long time . 
   the eus role would have been ensuring that those nations get protection from the wto in doing this . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why i asked . 
  but i meant would you like to see the eu doing the expropriation under new legislation , or the national governments under existing ones ( when applied ) . 
  basically what these two lovely shaps said . 
  eu wise or country wise ? 
  huzzah for cooperation !, 
   perhaps their parents can do better , how do you know that 's not the case ? 
  because their solution to this `` problem '' is asking for asilum . 
   the right to be indoctrinated by the state ? 
  against the right to be indoctrinated in a religion ? 
  * in varietate concordia *, 
   edit : speeling oh the irony loool, 
  yeah well , sorry but their children are not their property . 
  and the children have the civil right to have the best education the system can give them . 
  so yeah , good for germany to fight for the civil rights of children !, 
  what does fyrom stand for ? 
  he 's not comparing it with the eu economy , he 's comparing it with the uk . 
  what did he wrote ?

  you know what 's a cool country ? 
  good to see generalisation !, 
  i like that the word people is so big . 
  makes me fell all warm and fuzzy inside . 
  that just makes them irresponsible and incompetent , but does n't mean it 's not the job description . 
  exactly what i said ... 
  i mean we would have been conquered by spain . 
  you know , like prussia and russia did to poland a couple times . 
  i 've seen where this is heading for ages but i 'm still answering . 
  they should care because it 's their job . 
  we 're still free because demonstrations like this are still possible , we can still say what we want without persecution , we can still assembly , we can still form political parties and oppose the current government , we can still do everything we could before the sovereign debt crisis started . 
  harsh economic environment does n't mean we 're not free or that we are politically oppressed . 
  just means someone along the line someone fucked up really bad . 
  now it 's in our hands to let the same bunch do what they do , or get someone else to do it right , but this does n't mean revolution or extremism . 
  better as in for the entire society and not just a few . 
  a footnote in a history book . 
  because there are other ways to cut public spending like the public private partnerships . 
  and better ways to increase revenue by injecting money in the economy instead of draining it . 
  not at all . 
  i was in sintra enjoying an empty village because of the demonstration . 
  what you 're describing is lose of sovereignty in fiscal issues , one can argue if it brought a decreased level of freedom but i think it 's absurd since it 's still possible for a party that is elected on a `` leave the eu and euro '' platform run for an election and win . 
  now , a democracy is defined by the will of the majority being imposed on the minority . 
  since the majority of the people have n't voted for a party that runs on the leave the eu institutions platform , saying there 's no democracy because what one wants is n't being done is just dumb . 
   it 's not a democracy in the sense that the portuguese people have no say on their future yes you do !, 
  the state does n't forbid you to do anything at all !, 
  you can leave , you can stay , you can try to find a job or you can start your won company . 
  what is happening right now is that the government is n't giving opportunities to stay , find a job or even create your own business . 
  but that does n't make the country less democratic , it makes the government incompetent since it was elect to make all this easy !, 
  like you said , one can argue what led us to this situation , but unlike you said , this is still a free and democratic republic . 
  a rather full of incompetence , corruption , nepotism and unfairness free and democratic republic , but a free and democratic republic non the less !, 
   this is not a anti-austerity protests , people in portugal understood the need for `` austerity '' and there was no protests for a long time [ ... ] is not the job or responsability of people that make 300 $ / month or unemployed to come up with a alternative , it 's the job of the government . 
  agreed . 
   when ** [ 1 million people ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m3cuzlwisqm/tgkzijcr8ri/aaaaaaaanv0/yle1olbmyvw/s1600/dr_evil_one_million_dollars.jpg ) ** sources please ...  but since portugal is no longer a democracy it will have no results . 
  right ... 
   yes , but how ? 
  why would the government stop it ? 
  the how is the reason why i do n't participate in these kind of things . 
  they just make a lot of noise but add nothing to the conversation except saying `` i do n't like this , so fix it '' . 
  regarding the `` why , '' because the government is cutting pensions on people who worked their whole lives but now only recieve 300 $ because before the revolution taxation was poorly documented if done at all . 
  so now you have people who worked 50 + years ( starting to work at the age of 12 was rather common at the time ) and now only get enough money to buy their medicine , at best . 
  but at the same time , because a few years back the government bough the banking pension fund , the state is paying thousands ( between 20k and 75k ) of euros in pensions to a few fellas who build absolutely nothing and just gambled with other people money . 
  ( not trying to pass make a point just explaining something ) . 
  meanwhile we see the unemployment rising every month , and at least once a week there 's a minister or someone connected to the government saying something stupid like `` if the beggars on the street can make it , so can the rest . '', 
  adding to this , we do n't really have an opposition in portugal . 
  since the revolution there were 4 kinds of government . 
  either ps ( social party ) , psd ( social democratic party ) , or any combination of one of these in coalition . 
  the cds ( `` christian '' party/popular ) has in multiple occasions sided with the psd ( both , right wing on the portuguese spectrum ) and it 's seen just as a more of the same . 
  on the other side we have the pcp ( portuguese communist party ) and the be ( left block ) which are n't real options because of how radical they are ( the be even more than the pcp ) . 
  so we get what we have now , and for the last 15ish years ( since dur\u00e3o barroso ) . 
  the party in government says that cuts have to be done on education , health and social security , the oposition says no more cuts nor tax increses . 
  then the government party loses the election and the oposition gets to form government but now they say , oh wait , we need to cut on education , health and social security meanwhile the party that 's now on the opposition says , `` no no no no , no more of that '' . 
  and while these things that are needed to the every day living of the population are getting cutted , we see public/pricate partnerships that never worked being done , old ministers getting high paying jobs on companies that got a good deal while that guy was minister , higher taxes , more cuts on education , health and social security and no real opposition . 
  the pathetic thing is that it 's literally like this . 
  last election was won because of people were completely tired of our former prime minister and the current promised what we wanted to hear , but i 'll give you an example of the political conversation in a typical portuguese election : when dur\u00e3o barroso left the government and went to the european commission , there was no need for elections so he was replaced by the number 2 of the party . 
  not exactly ok with this but this is not where i want to get to . 
  eventually he was fired . 
  the next election the primary topic of discussion was what was the sexuality of one of the candidates , who to be honest , won because he was running against the guy who got fired ( and was also rumoured to be gay , like anyone gives a crap ) . 
  and this is why people in portugal complain . 
  in 1974 our military got tired of the war and retired the regime , now there 's no war but there 's a huge mess and a lot of something that * can * , but will never be , called corruption . 
  the end of austerity , but what i meant was that it was n't organized by any political party of union . 
  it was organized by a group of people that are tired of the damn austerity and stupidity/hypocrisy of the government . 
  few things : - the demonstration was completely apolitical . 
  - the numbers of the organizers were 800k , other sources put them around 500k - there 's a lot of discontent about the policies of the government , but a call to arms is a bit too much ... just my [ 2 cents ] ( http://www.eurocoins.co.uk/images/2002eurozone2eurocentrev240.jpg ), 
  two sandwiches of turkey ham , some strawberries and a glass of water .
