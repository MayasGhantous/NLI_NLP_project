  so healthy !, 
  such a small country has a personality like vald and what they do with it ? 
  they show what they did , as in , for real !, 
  were this western europe or north america that guy would have saved the country riding a bear on top of a mountain lion on top of a t-rex . 
  i 'm looking at you teddy roosevelt , thomas jefferson , william wallace , richard i , bismark , etc. . . 
  to be honest i think it 's not in the interest of the eu to have turkey either . 
  that would put the eu borders in the middle-east . 
  having turkey as an ally and buffer state is , in my opinion , a more suited situation . 
  they could still benefit the same deal norway , switzerland and the rest and not be in the eu, 
  i 'm sorry chap , but your question makes no sense since it implies i do some things without a top hat !, 
  indeed, 
  i stand by my mistakes !, 
  xd still , coolest breed evah !, 
  thanks man , but i 'm not really jobless , my job just gives me time to browse the interwebs . 
  i 'm a doorman . 
  living the life !, 
  edit : suddenly a word . 
  * whistle ^ ^ ^ changed ^ ^ ^ it, 
   do you have an immediate reaction to the word `` islam '' ? 
  how does it make you feel ? 
  it makes me feel hungry ... ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ close ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ lunch ^ ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ reason . 
   what does the skin colour tell us about a person ? 
  their level of melanin  all roma are ... ... lucky bastards who study at a great [ uni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_tre_university )  adolf hitler was ... ... an historic leader . 
   i 'm not a racist , but ... ... 
  i think poodles are not dogs and german shepard 's are cooler than all others . 
  i nominate myself because at the moment i have way more free time than i wish i had, 
  the question is regarding why old colonies citizens travel to colonizing countries . 
  when was poland a colony of the british empire ? 
  i do n't get it, 
   also , europe managed to colonize most of the world because it was already wealthy and more advanced . 
  not the other way around . 
  no ... just ... no !, 
  europe colonized the world because of a great many deal of factors , but wealth and technological advance was not two of them . 
  the colonization of the americas ( or rather how it was colonized ) for example was possible because the native did n't have anti-bodies to the diseases the european were caring . 
  it was the colonization of the americas and the glorified piracy by europeans on the indian ocean that brought the wealth you are talking about . 
  before the colonization started , both india ( the sub-continent ) and china were as wealthy and rich as europe . 
  the reason china did n't colonize the world at the time was a shift into internal policy by the emperor hongxi , but before him , admiral zheng he made several voyages around the indian ocean . 
  we 're living in what is now the remnants of an euro-centric world basically because luck , and shit happens !, 
  it 's not just the language , usually former colonies have better immigration pacts with the colonizing country . 
  i do n't think treaties that brazil/angola signed with portugal could possibly be signed between brazil/angola and france or italy . 
  former colonizing countries have a historic responsibility ( lacking a better word here ) to have more open migration policies with former colonized countries . 
  from my experience ( also lived in spain where i have family and half my family is actually from ) , yes . 
  when portugal and spain are recipients of migration waves it 's usually from former colonies . 
  in portugal it was immigrants from war torn angola that fuelled the growth of the late 90 's . 
  that is quite visible in lisbon where you ca n't take two steps without crossing with an african . 
  the same thing does n't happen in the interior of the country since these workers were usually non skilled construction workers . 
  and construction was manly focused on the big coastal cities ( lisbon , porto , faro ) . 
  on the 2000 's and until the foreign-debt mess we 're in , the flow from african immigrants stagnated because of the stability and growth angola is living . 
  from then on , it was brazilians , who , if i 'm not mistaken , are now the biggest `` minority '' in the country . 
  but they did n't stay just on the big cities . 
  it 's rather easy to see a brazilian anywhere in portugal ( of course there are towns where it 's more likely to see them since like with all diaspora people tend to concentrate ) . 
  the same is pretty much true in spain , but to be honest i could n't tell the spanish american accents apart except for mexicans so i ca n't say which ones were more prevalent ( definitely not mexicans though ) . 
  still on that ? 
  easily available at any store . 
  oh lets see , several things . 
  let 's list them ? 
  - lack of public knowledge when making said contracts - using ** fire ** fighters to get people evicted - evicting old ladies with 85 years of age when they get ** one ** month late . 
  - getting bailouts and evicting the people that bailed them out . 
  shall we continue or you get the picture ? 
  that would make sense . 
  it 's rather depressing , and comic at the same time , to see tourists with a skin tone paler than google 's home page staying under the mid-day sun on summer . 
  the belgian job, 
  yeah fuck rice !, 
  long live the potato !, 
  holy crap that was hilarious !, 
  the world should make it happen !, 
  i really hope not . 
  the best thing that can happen to the anticlerical cause is a conservator with backward ideas !, 
  it 's still possible . 
  the only requirement you need to be elected pope is being baptised by the catholic church and that you have a penis . 
  so hey ... who knows ? 
  what ? 
  really ? 
  i 'm with you . 
  it 's an amazing event . 
  yeah , god bless him ( sarcasm ) . 
  but either way , he did resign . 
  and so did gregory xii in order to try to end the schism since there were 3 people claiming the papacy . 
  on one way or the other it 's a very rare occasion . 
  ca n't believe i 'm alive to see it !, 
  yes , in 1045 , pope benedict ix . 
  wonder if that 's why he chose the name . 
  edit : and pope celestine v in 1294 and the last one was pope gregory xii in 1415, 
  indeed . 
  i ca n't really say anyone could see this one coming , specially from such a conservative pope . 
  [ what ? 
  not saying that . 
  but 1 sardine for 3 is not a euphemism used . 
  you 'd be average and broke by the time you passed the border . 
  [ joke about how the govt is stealing everyone ], 
  oh you 'd have a bad time . 
  that is average . 
  most people i know are as tall as me and i 'm at 1.77 . 
  old folks are shorter though, 
  the famine during the dictatorship, 
  it was . 
  thanks, 
  i 'm colour blind ... which of the two horrible blues is monti ? 
  it depends on a lot of things we do n't know . 
  like was that the only question ?
