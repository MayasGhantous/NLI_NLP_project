  because that is brutal . 
  i 'd guess either one of the polls is wrong or they both are . 
  edit : numbers ... 
  not saying it 's weird , just saying , we 're less imaginative . 
  though i 'll start calling lisbon joyful bay xd, 
  do n't worry about it . 
  we 're worse than you folks . 
  every thing is named after a saint ... go figure !,

  had i read the last sentence only and i 'd think you 're portguese ... 
  let 's agree to disagree . 
  i read it when i was 16 or something . 
  i still shiver when i pass by it on a book store . 
   $ 511 if you mean 10k escudos ? 
  that would be 50 $, 
  conversion ? 
  in portugal we had 10 000 escudos note . 
   ... just remember that when the uk joined it was n't the eu , just the eec , which was basically a customs union , something that was of mutual benefit for everyone involved . 
  ** no one knew what direction it was going to take ** ... just taking on this . 
  churchill :  we must build a kind of united states of europe . 
  in this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living . 
  and him again :  we see nothing but good and hope in a richer , freer , more contented european commonality . 
  but we have our own dream and our own task . 
  we are with europe , but not of it . 
  we are linked but not compromised . 
  we are interested and associated but not absorbed . 
  he was in favour of a federal europe , just thought the uk had no place in it . 
  but this proves nothing so , i give you ... * the solemn declaration on european union * signed in 1985 , the uk entered the eec in 1973 :  the heads of state or government of the member states of the european communities meeting within the european council resolved to continue the work begun on the basis of the treaties of paris and rome and to create a united europe , which is more than ever necessary in order to meet the dangers of the world situation , capable of assuming the responsibilities incumbent on it by virtue of its political role , its economic potential and its manifold links with other peoples , [ ... ] the heads of state or government , on the basis of an awareness of a common destiny and the wish to affirm the european identity , confirm their commitment to progress towards an ever closer union among the peoples and member states of the european community . 
  the treaty of the european union aka the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 . 
  this is plenty of time to opt-out . 
  but maybe the uk was forced to get on board with this since it was already in before there was even a hint of federalization . 
  but now i 'll give you ... jean monnet on the european coal and steel community ( pre eec ) :  through the consolidation of basic production and the institution of a new high authority , whose decisions will bind france , germany and the other countries that join , this proposal represents the first concrete step towards a european federation , imperative for the preservation of peace . 
  and yet again , but this time still during the war :  there will be no peace in europe , if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty ... 
  the countries of europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development . 
  the european states must constitute themselves into a federation ... 
  this is where i 'll take the time to remember you that monnet was behind the creation of the ecsc and eec . 
  to the point that the eec was n't the only community that was going to be created , there was also a political and a defence community , but then the defence one failed to pass on the french parliament he resigned from the high authority and focused on the economic one . 
  what i mean by this is , claiming ignorance of what this was from the start either means that your politicians lied to you , or that your politicians were incredibly incompetent . 
  in either case this means they should have never been your leaders . 
  on the other hand , they might have never lied to you and knew all along what this was , but they just wanted to get the max out of it while it was possible . 
  if this is the case , kudos , but now might be the time to leave . 
  we all got a lot from it , no hard feelings . 
  just do n't say that the uk did n't knew what this was from the start . 
  edit : just to add asterisks edit 2 : i love the uk and do n't really want it out . 
  just to make it clear . 
  well you said it yourself . 
  not that it ca n't per se , but the euro-zone wont let it happen . 
  how i see it , yes the euro will help the economy . 
  and not just with the default thing ( which is more of a fiscal concern than an economy one ) . 
  exports to euro-zone are easier ( our main exporting market , or should we say the euro-zone is a domestic market ? 
  ) , work mobility within the zone is easier , but the best and most important thing is , we have to have a working economy !, 
  we all can agree , i think , that the implementation of the euro was poorly done . 
  but i do n't believe anyone who at least is macro-economical educated ( is this even a thing ? ), 
  will say that it did n't good for the countries ( low interest rates on loans ) . 
  again , the situation the whole zone is in at the moment was made possible by how it was implemented . 
  what i mean by this is lack of fiscal union . 
  but now , with the steps being made by the european commission and the european council towards said union i do n't see something like this happening again ( to elaborate , i think it wont happen again because i truly believe this is the first steps to a full pledge federalization of the eu ) . 
  so yes , things are bad , in fact , things are worse than bad . 
  so bad in fact that i 'm leaving the country , but i truly believe it will get better . 
  and the euro with it 's fiscal union and bank supervision will be what in the future will prevent anything like this ever happening again . 
  but i might just be overly optimistic ... 
  that is scary, 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 i hate you and all you represent good sir !, 
  well on a subject of good writers , i really like luis miguel rocha . 
  my favourite was gil vicente . 
  technicly plays , but damn that was fun !, 
  but it was so long ago i do n't even remember when it was i had to read it . 
  looking at what is on the side of the mediterranean sean from the shores of italy made that mentality change, 
  that is , imho , the worst book i 've put my hand on . 
  so damn boring . 
  why did he need that many pages to describe a damn room ?!? 
  the nightmares !!!, 
  just adressing this one :  it 's better at dragging countries like greece , ** portugal ** , ireland and spain through the mud . 
  what are on about ? 
  it was thanks to the euro that portugal is n't worse at the moment . 
  it 's thanks to the euro that a enormous amount of infrastructural investment was possible . 
  it 's thanks to the euro that we had advantage in sending our corporations to countries like angola and brazil to invest . 
  the situation portugal is in is because of absurd political choices ( by politicians and we the people who voted them into power ) and bailouts that did n't needed to happen . 
  just the biggest exemple : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banco_portugu%c3%aas_de_neg%c3%b3cios this bank was later sold for 40 million euros ... edit : suddenly a letter, 
   if the yankees are the ones saying this , i dunno , the usa already has excessive influence within the eu . . how so ? 
  honest question . 
  at twelve ? 
  well there 's always the the [ other that fits his style ] ( http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6093/6321882448_c54f2f8b41_z.jpg ), 
  just a nitpick out of context . 
  it still bugs me how out of portugal there 's no definitive way to write his name , and if there 's going to be one ever , it wont be how we all know him here . 
  he said britain not england ... 
  o programa do aleixo was the only thing that made me watch sic radical in the last years . 
  and sidra , do n't forget the asturian national sport of escanciar and drinking sidra !, 
  not that true , but thanks xd, 
  as someone with a few brits has friends , they are very proud of that feat . 
  no , nooo , nonononononononono ... no !, 
  yeah , but that 's not voted and the mandate is very limited . 
  i 'd vote that guy for president of the eu ... if there was such thing as voting for the presidency of the eu . 
  well i think we can forgive teen girls for that . 
  but yeah . 
  been ages since i 've seen a woman with the mythic bu\u00e7o . 
  and i could even thank god for that if i was into that kind of stuff,
