  i also think that the uk likes the good things that the eu brings with it , but is too paranoid of the main land to nurture the european project . 
  nice wall of text , here 's a few misconceptions of yours :  the portuguese people vote for their government and their parliament . 
  all parties present a candidate for prime minister and representatives for parliament . 
  each voter votes on one of these parties , and whichever gets more votes , gets to the government . 
  this is not true sorry . 
  you vote for a party on your electoral circle , depending on the number or voters , the circle gets a certain number or appointments to the parliament . 
  depending on the votes each party gets , that party gets a number or people who were previously listed . 
  what happens after the legislative elections is that the president calls the leaders of the parties with seats on the parliament and after consideration appoints a prime-minister to form a government . 
  this pm is traditionally the leader of the party with most sits on the parliament , but it 's not mandatory . 
  the president can call anyone to be pm . 
  the problem is that the pm answers to the president ** and ** the parliament , and it must implement the laws the parliament passes . 
  can you imagine how chaotic it would be to run the government without the support of the parliament ? 
  or with threats of votes of no confidence on a weekly basis ? 
  to ensure stability , the president just ** invites ** the leader of a party ( usually the one with most seats ) to be pm . 
   the portuguese people also vote for their president who has the power to either veto or sign every new laws and has the power to ` fire ' any government . 
  incrdibly , this power has never been abused of . 
  it has happened two times , both in the last decade , both because the governments sucked ( and ` sucked ' state money to useless and destructive policies and measures ) . 
  some what wrong . 
  the president can only `` fire '' a government in case of `` crisis '' that was made by said government , or if there 's a social shift so big that is clear that the * deputados * do n't represent the people anymore . 
  this is because after the government takes power , it takes to the parliament the `` program of government '' that is accepted by the newly elected * deputados * . 
  this is what gives any government legitimacy . 
  if you get a government without an approved `` program '' you can get it fired by the president . 
   those i vote for always keep their word . 
  they 're known by those who respect them as being tenacious , coherent , stubborn and full of integrity . 
  among their enemies , they 're know for being inflexible , pesky and uncollaborative of the great debt market capitalists ( not free market , even if they say so ) ruling all over our mighty democracies of europe . 
  be or pcp ? 
  edit : as an example the pms of the iii and v government were independent . 
  since when is the middle east a continent ? 
  autobans ... autobans everywhere !, 
  18 years in the countries that still have mandatory military service ... 
  lmao you just made my day !, 
  actually reading his comments i do n't think he 's a troll ... just slightly retarded . 
  agreed . 
  last time something [ like this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_two ) happens it did n't ended well ... 
  you 're over simplifying it . 
  never was lisbon subservient to madrid . 
  at the time filipe iios/iop even wanted to bring the capital of both empires to lisbon . 
  quote from [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_union ) article :  when philip ii of portugal ( philip iii of spain ) died , he was succeeded by philip iii ( and iv of spain ) who had a different approach on portuguese issues . 
  taxes raised affected mainly the portuguese merchants ( carmo reis 1987 ) . 
  the portuguese nobility began to lose its importance at the spanish cortes , and government posts in portugal were occupied by spaniards . 
  ultimately , ** philip iii tried to make portugal a royal province , and portuguese nobles lost all of their power . 
  **  several other problems also damaged portuguese support of their union with spain . 
  one of these was certainly the pressure from the center , especially from the count-duke of olivares , towards uniformity and sharing the financial and military burden of castile 's wars in europe . 
  however , the portuguese were hardly inclined to help with that , as spain had failed to prevent the dutch occupation of several of portugal 's colonial holdings , despite the fact that both the portuguese and the dutch were nominally under the same crown . 
  he 's in for the long run i see, 
  hence why i said `` to be a nice guy '' . 
  but here 's the catch . 
  personal union is not the same as unification . 
  there were 2 different courts , 2 different legal systems , 2 empires , one monarch . 
  if you consider a personal union a unification , then the uk , canada and all the rest of the commonwealth is still one single state because they still have elizabeth ii as queen . 
  edit : the moment filipe iv of spain , iii of portugal tried to unify the 2 countries we revolted . 
  let me put it like this . 
  like turnusb said , portugal was never part of spain . 
  spain is relatively new country . 
  portugal is close to 900 years , spain as you know it is around 530 years and i 'm not counting the actual unification here just to be a nice guy . 
  a union like this where spain gains control over portugal would be the day we 'd burn everything in lisbon , politicians included . 
  i 'd love too see any european countries without immigrants .

  why do i have to say this to an american ? 
  i do n't know his plans , but i 'd vote for him !, 
  it 's an almost 20 year old green paper . 
  the www was pretty much invented at cern by a brit and a belgian . 
  / thread, 
  i 'm going against the stream here and i 'll say that the flag is awful . 
  i really do n't like it . 
  imo the colours do n't mach each other and the crests are horrible . 
  never really liked none of them ... 
  i know right ?!, 
  here 's another . 
  blocking the un from doing something in syria , claiming the international community do n't have a say in other countries internal affairs while pushing their own agenda on georgia . 
  the two chechen wars the russia-ukraine relations regarding energy to europe the south ossetia , and abkhazia afairs . 
  the dead spy in london a few years ago . 
  this last decade or century ? 
  true . 
  nato exists because russia is hostile , russian is more hostile because nato exists , * ad nauseum * . 
  yes , germany is the great wall against russia to us in the west . 
  the thing about territorial battles is the distance between the border and the centre of power . 
  nowadays there 's no mere border disputes , when two ** great powers ** battle each other it 's in a state of total war . 
  one will annihilate the other to take all the resources and create a bigger gab between the next rival and the centre of power . 
  this is the main reason the lon and the un were created , the avoid more wars like this between ** great powers ** . 
  an increase in territory from russia to the west is a threat to all europe in my opinion . 
  ok we can agree to disagree , but the matter of the fact is that russia is still a threat to europe , and a unified europe can counter that threat . 
  huzzah deal !, 
  israel gives us money , we 'll pay it back pwetty pwease ? 
  i think the difficulty europe has on projecting power comes from the lack of a central foreign affairs decision making organism . 
  you need to chill and not delete comments because i wrote this to the one you wrote first . 
   good , downvote me please , because you disagree with what i have to say , even though it 's a perfectly viable contribution to the discussion . . 
  yes it is a viable contribution to the discussion . 
  dude , i have n't given you a [ down vote ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unoam.jpg ) ... chill . 
   please , explain why you said this , and what relevance does it have in this discussion ? 
  because the resources needed for conventional warfare was present in europe before wwii and it still is . 
  the relevance is that , though european armies are n't the greatest in the world , the combination of them all are the second greatest . 
  germany alone is a great military power , and so is france and the uk .
