** portugal ** good news : * ( 1 ) announcement of websummit moving to lisbon in 2016 - [ link ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/23/web-summit-dublin-lisbon-2016 ) , ( 2 ) [ jo\u00e3o sousa in a atp final ] ( http://www.meusresultados.com/jogo/ivwvoph0/#sumario-do-jogo ) , ( 3 ) miguel oliveira win in moto 3 - [ link ] ( http://tenplay.com.au/news/2015/09/27/oliveira-wins-dramatic-moto3-aragon-gp ) elections next week . 
  campaign is rolling and stuff that happened include : * ( 1 ) minor party ( pctp-mrpp ) used the words `` death to traitors '' , then removed it . 
  ( 2 ) media messing with a speaker and going for distortion : a guy said `` ps '' , media said - he said `` palha\u00e7o ! '', 
  in an event with [ costa ] ( http://imgur.com/a/c4f8n ) ( ps leader ) . 
  ( 3 ) there are problems with votes from people living in other countries . 
  ( 4 ) meanwhile , ex-pm and ex-jailed , but locked in home , jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates ( ps ) finally has access to his process - timing of these news look suspicious . 
  ( 5 ) a humor program labeled as `` daily show das barracas '' grabs attention , including a psd guy being asked `` is there a chance we 'll see [ passos coelho ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/3lzi5z/passos_coelho_de_2015_em_debate_com_passos_coelho/ ) ( psd leader ) in s\u00f3crates current situation ? 
  edgy , but well done , imo . 
  ( 6 ) edgy stuff includes a minor party guy ( pdr ) saying `` people should pee outside the usual potty '' . 
  then , humorists put somebody peeing in a potty with guy 's foto .

  ** portugal ** another ama on r/portugal - rui tavares this time and more to come lots of debates before 2015 the portuguese legislative election that will be held on 4 october 2015 . 
  uber and taxis in real fights . 
  and some success on sports , with our football national team in a good position ( also ronaldo scoring 5 , not so good for mourinho ) , tiago monteiro 's wtcc win , nelson oliveira getting a vuelta stage while others like jos\u00e9 gon\u00e7alves had good results and more . 
  i do n't know what was j. s\u00f3crates meal last night . 
  and that 's good . 
  at least the ones i heard recently !, 
  politicians now come to our sub and our ex-prime minister s\u00f3crates got out of jail - he ca n't leave his home though and journalists mess with pizza boys that just want to deliver his food . 
  that 's curious for me . 
  portuguese like me are not bad with spanish and i actually think south americans ( not including mexicans here , thinking about colombia , argentina ) are easier to understand because they speak slower than europeans . 
  anyway , most of the time i 'm just reading in spanish , not hearing/talking and in the press i do n't notice that many differences . 
  i guess i 'll try get to get one of these as soon as they 're available . 
  hopefully nobody will care about my inability to differentiate the way i spell the * r * and the * j * of rojo . 
  is the difference really that big to make you think it 's hard to create a standard test ? 
  weird , i thought left bloc kicked the caviar to agir and livre . 
  \\ #weneverhadacoup cavaco ( pr ) suggested that this deal had to respect our commitment to the european project . 
  anti eu politicans from europe ( ukip and such ) just played with his words and created the false coup on twitter based on the assumption that this deal would be denied ( not appointed ) because there are ( slightly ? ), 
  euro-skeptic parties involved . 
  here 's a translation ***** president of the republic appointed the general secretary of ps [ socialist party ] as prime minister following today 's audition that president of the republic gave to general secretary of ps , ant\u00f3nio costa , the presidency presents the following note : `` the information obtained during the meetings with social agents , institutions and figures of civil society confirmed that continuing with the 20th government of portugal , limited to the practice of necessary acts to keep the management of public business , was not of national interest . 
  this situation would keep going for indefinite period , given the lack of possibility , declared on the constitution , of proceeding , until april of next year to the dissolution of the national assembly and a call for elections . 
  president of the republic has taken note of general secretary of socialist party answer to the doubts presented about the documents signed with bloco de esquerda ( left bloc ) , partido comunista portugu\u00eas ( communist party ) e o partido ecologista `` os verdes '' ( green party ) about the stability and durability of a minority government of socialist party in the span of the legislature term . 
  thus , president of the republic , decided , after hearing the parties with a seat in the parliament , to appoint dr. ant\u00f3nio costa as prime-minister . 
  ***** i 'm not used to translate this kind of notes , so i welcome your criticism . 
   it 's undemocratic . 
  you voted in deputies . 
  if you voted be , you are represented by be deputies . 
  now , those be deputies , who represent you , commited to a deal . 
  it 's democracy . 
  people can be unhappy , but do n't be silly . 
  i 'm surprised a be voter thinks this way , but whatever . 
  centre-right government rejection vote completed . 
  not yet . 
  says he is left wing supporter / says a left gov is the ultimate demise . 
  makes sense ... can you help me understand that ? 
  but it 's a 7 pages pdf . 
  ai n't nobody got time for that :p and those who are really interested will use the tools for it , 
  portugal : ps and left parties reached some agreements . 
  in the next days minority right government ( paf ) should fall and then cavaco silva will have to approve the ps government . 
  in portugal euroscepticism is really low , and even voters of left parties ( parties that suggest they want to leave euro when it 's convenient ) do n't really want to leave the euro . 
  a big figure of one of these parties made a study concluding we 'd be 30 % poorer immediately , and now the left parties just say `` it 's a thing we have to study '' not a `` we must leave now '' . 
  leaving euro as soon as possible is just the saying of a little ` eternal 1 % ' party which is quite funny to follow . 
  guys like farage using portugal as an example to leverage his opinion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr-lz5yon5e ( at 0:52 ) - when portugal is not a factual example of what he claims does n't sound too good for us . 
  maybe there 's a crisis coming , but you ca n't use us an example right now , when cavaco silva speech did n't totally shut the door to the left parties . 
  give it a few days and we 'll know more about it . 
  misuse of development funds are a part of the problem and while you bring the example of it success of other countries , we can connect both worlds and see flops like [ pt @ covilh\u00e3 ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/investimento-da-portugal-telecom-na-covilha-esta-as-moscas_v864916 ) . 
  and during my degree , ydreams was touted as big example of the future but later there was a lot of criticism and this year we had news of insolvency . 
  that criticism lies in the idea that technology is an obvious choice , but you should not put all your eggs there and it may be too soon for projects like the datacenter . 
  that 's ambition mixed with eccentric views . 
  during my short work experience i visited other pricey infrastructures that really looked good , but regarding roi those infrastructures are a big waste of money . 
  new funds program , portugal2020 and the whole european ones focus on returns now , since they knew they were wasting a lot of money . 
  you had millionaire investments in spain , with a return of zero . 
  we obviously need an approach based on some clusters but in the long run , in cases like nokia in finland it can leave you with big problems in your hands . 
  a good management of portugal2020 is crucial . 
  and whatever happens , i guess public function will not be particularly favored in the next times . 
  they wo n't get cut , or easily fired , but europe would not ` approve ' any mad measures there . 
  ofc it should not be swept under the rug and there are people reappearing as ps faces that i thought they were politically dead and i was happy with that dead status . 
  however i 'm still convinced that our big bank faces are quite important in our downfall and while troika coming is reduced to a ps was obviously responsible vs but psd rejected pec4 , our banks are as important as them - the links with bpp , bpn and bes may hurt ps more though ( not sure here ) . 
  i focused on my fb and you know it 's cherry picking - everyone reading knows a fb front page with 300 friends is no good for polls unless you live in ohio  what matters there is that psd supporters are more active in social media . 
  they hold extreme views but those views seem quite flexible for me . 
  i always give the example of pctp who said they 'd go for novo escudo and we 'd be 30 % poorer immediately - while pcp and be softened their view a lot during the campaign and while they say they may want to do some pricey stuff anyway , i see that falling once responsibility arrives . 
  and it 's arriving , and i 'm happy to see these parties entering the arch , and not being against everything . 
  and well , i voted in a new center-left party with new ideas  as i expressed before , i guess our next years will depend more on the world and europe than our internal decisions . 
  ps on his own in 2005-2009 did what they wanted , and 2009-2011 they had to please to psd to keep it going until it cracked . 
  now , you may have ps leading , but with new policemen - news like the one we heard about boys nominations of psd two days ago - whenever ps tries stuff like that , be and pcp will raise their weapons and say no more . 
  i guess it will look like having an internal regulator who may ask for too much sometimes ( e.g. 
  min salary 600e ) but i want to see this . 
  and people should not be afraid of a new scenario - we already know what happens in ps solo , and psd/cds - otherwise we 'll just be the eternal good students risking to be a puppet if europe fails ( and then troika here again ) . 
  i do n't know how we 'll increase our negotiation power , but do you think paf is better for that than the others ? 
  i have no problem saying i voted in that little party that wanted `` this '' . 
  we can start in seguro vs costa . 
  back when costa took the wheel you had this scenario in folks minds - passos and his tecnoforma experience was a bunch of non transparent stuff , passos does n't pay ss , and relvas folklore experience was worth some credits in is degree . 
  the irrevocable stuff was on people 's minds too . 
  with all of this , obviously , ps had it in his hands . 
  however , despite a democratic decision inside ps in a solution proposed by seguro , whoever wanted to damage costa could play the coup card . 
  there was the greek stuff and observador sided views and rtp in one or two ocasions ( people do n't hate jose rodrigues dos santos for his books only ) managed to the leverage our aversion to uncertainty and costa did n't know what to say there and whatever he said , i know it was used against him . 
  in the meantime , there 's socrates , whoever voted in a guy and then sees him in jail thinks there 's something wrong with his past vote in ps , unless ofc you 're a member of s\u00f3crates sempre . 
  whatever the good news to ps , others would find a way to get s\u00f3crates in the spotlight and it was to easy to put down ps with such stuff . 
  also , social media psd propaganda machine is many many times better than all others . 
  my fb only has stuff favorable to paf ( perks of my region though ) and man , there are so many `` empty fans '' of paf - once i asked what a girl had against antonio costa and she said `` he 's the worse , the last i 'd vote for '' and i asked if pnr was n't worse and she did n't know what i was talking about and kept saying costa was really bad . 
  i expected him to resign at 10pm , but trying to think as ps man , i understand their decision and those voices asking for that were silent in a day or two . 
  he was a loser , when you compare it to seguro 's victories and ps managed it badly . 
  they had no trump cards in last days of campaign and played what they had too early ( ss , tecnoforma etc ) . 
  i think ps-be-cdu can survive if europe does well in the next times . 
  if a minor crisis erupted somewhere , problems would appear and irrevocable decisions would be no joke , and it would be over . 
  this in a ps + be and cdu support in case cavaco ends up accepting this scenario . 
  a left coalition is not going to happen so soon - we are seeing the first steps - a campaign scenario with them not refusing that possibility after the elections maybe , but never a pre electoral one . 
  for me , ( simplistic view ) ps voters are the almost eternal voters ( them and psd always have at least a 25 % guarantee ) and some voters who think it 's either ps or psd and chose ps this time since they do n't want passos anymore . 
  that sentence of people of `` i would n't have voted if '' is a mystery to me .
