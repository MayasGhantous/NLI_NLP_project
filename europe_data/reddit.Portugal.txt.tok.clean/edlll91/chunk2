  there 's another guy around here who made a strong comment in that direction that honestly sounds like a smart-jsd-boy would say to gather sympathy to his comment - i 'm still waiting his reply . 
  everyone knows that the program will be ps - be and pcp will make their pressure in salary stuff and not much more . 
  i do n't think their views are extreme - they abandoned the leaving euro and eu are an immediate goal and whenever people ask about the cost of it , you can see that their views there are of a work in progress , and not a strong position . 
  i 'm not seeing people claiming to be cheated - except of course paf people who probably see comments like the mystery vote guy and then say they heard about a huge bunch of people feeling that . 
  and since costa rejected the `` arch '' idea , he ~ ~ has ~ ~ was opening a door . 
  things are not going too bad for costa since oct 4 8:01 pm . 
  for a moment paf was dreaming with a majority . 
  few hours later there was no such thing and costa survived and he could choose not to quit . 
  then , pcp opens the door . 
  costa immediately becomes a powerful person . 
  every pro-paf claims he 's hungry for power , but he 's doing what everyone would do in his position ( assis is just playing the game of a ps leader wannabe ) . 
  costa talks with foreign media and everything is okay , markets calm down ( draghi influence ) and media like observador ca n't play that card . 
  and if cavaco chose him immediately , that decision would not be well understood in portugal . 
  instead , cavaco chose passos , while speech destroyed internal differences of ps and assis view no longer exists . 
  the coup stuff was an exaggeration , but cavaco 's words `` made '' it . 
  and with cavaco choosing passos , there 's more time for a deal of costa with jeronimo and catarina . 
  ps is now saying they 'll present the deal just before they present their rejection of paf government . 
  their tactics are being quite good , whether you agree with ps or not . 
   i voted in a left-wing party but if i knew this coalition was coming after the election , supposedly in my name and other voters , i would have voted for the right wing coalition . 
  do you want to elaborate this ? 
  that 's curious to say the least . 
  my take : telegraph is clearly playing with uk feelings about more or less eu influence . 
  there 's no constitutional crisis ... yet . 
  while cavaco silva said a lot of stuff which will not a put a smile on be & pcp voters ( left parties ) , there 's still a chance of an approved deal . 
  if ps , be and pcp reach a deal , with public details and cavaco decides to refuse it , then ~ ~ is ~ ~ yes , you can talk about coups , crisis , threats and stuff . 
  in a few days , we 'll have news about it . 
  my wording may suggest that , but no . 
  he was just `` free '' from the country for a while , after his 2011 elections loss , when he was studying in france . 
  he is not in prison since september , he was ~ ~ in ~ ~ locked in his house , but now he can leave his house and he just ca n't leave the country without permission . 
  a curious fact i heard on tv yesterday - the size of his process : 30000 pages . 
  pages and pages and no conclusion at all . 
  [ s\u00f3crates ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_s%c3%b3crates#cite_note-publico-3 ) is a free man once again . 
  ** portugal ** after the elections nobody knows what 's going on , because winners may be losers and losers may be winners . 
  also , you will not see us in eurovision 2016 . 
  after all , it counted . 
  time for portugal to get the first place of the [ uncertainty avoidance ranking ] ( http://www.clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/uncertainty-avoidance-index/ ) !, 
  my bad then . 
  will correct my comment . 
  thanks . 
   20:00 - paf wins in exit poll with the possibility of majority !!!, 
  38-43 % vs 30-35 % ps op was a bit too excited . 
  not even 37 % for paf in continental portugal, 
  paf wins, 
  come on . 
  these are words to grab the attention of people who were happy with syriza success and ps fear is seeing some voters going to be/cdu/lta . 
  again , what ps proposes has nothing to do with syriza . 
  people who are not happy want something new . 
  syriza was something new . 
  so , he said something new was good . 
  so what ? 
  he still has nothing to do with it . 
  whatever he said , it would not be perfect . 
  the same way he had no good solution when s\u00f3crates was a subject . 
  costs money & some salaries depend on the number of voters . 
  people whose salary depends on the number voters are among those who should care about `` cleaning '' it . 
  obviously , they 'll not do something that will reduce the money going to their pocket . 
  only a top decision trying to do it in the whole country would correct it . 
  but nobody cares , and we have that little ridiculous detail . 
  a reminder for non-portuguese redditors : whenever you see the abstention numbers , you should not trust them , as we have [ 800000-1000000 ] ghosts in the lists . 
  therefore , the abstention is always lower than reported . 
  there are some reasons for that high number of ghosts , in case you 're interested . 
  do n't forget we had a fascist dictator until 74 . 
  and our constitutional statement - which makes us part of [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_socialist_states ) saying we have a socialist state is worth zero nowadays . 
  he just said something to please left voters and what ps proposes has nothing to do with syriza . 
  media tricked you and made you think the opposite ? 
  pan is our likes winner . 
  that means nothing . 
  you can have a direct translation to `` factos alternativos '' , but also hot right now are ` erros de percep\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00fatua ' ( both parts are misunderstanding each other ) , truques ( basically ` tricks ' , not necessarily 100 % lies ) , ` inverdades ' ( ` untruths ' ) , or the basic ` not\u00edcias falsas ' ( fake news ) . 
  [ she actually smiled in reaction to that joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whzoi2y75sm&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m7s ), 
  thanks !, 
  what does it say exactly ? 
  ( besides yes or no to hitler in march 1938 ), 
  what 's the explanation for the shift in the polls from clear lead to yes , to everything pointing no ? 
  i guess you may like / r/languagelearning and the related subs, 
  thank you . 
  that 's a scenario that is quite easy to understand . 
  that was really interesting . 
  you mentioned some internal moves , specially here  but there were still elements within the party that leaned closer to conservatives . 
  gradually , fdp mpp 's left the fdp and joined the cdu , until the government finally lost it 's majority in parliament . 
  is it something that still happens in 2015 ? 
  e : in portugal i guess we do n't have an important shift since a single deputy moved from center right to center , therefore allowing a majority , in 1999 . 
  that 's a quite complex political game indeed . 
   the flemish north and the french-speaking south of the country can not vote for eachother 's parties . 
  so the pm is always from one of the two sides , and the other side , whatever they voted for , does not deliver the pm . 
  just this sentence had me thinking that belgium political system is way more complicated than i previously thought . 
  no wonder you conclude  having a government is kind of victory in itself here  thanks for the details, 
  wow thanks for your detailed response . 
  that 's a lot of knowledge and it took you some time . 
  i 'll reread it later and may ask you to clear some doubts . 
  for now , i found it curious that the pm is from venstre , and one supporter has more seats , but i guess i got why . 
  ***** regarding the portuguese situation , be & cdu ( pcp+pev ) , the left parties , they are constantly out of the consultations . 
  they are somewhat close to some labor unions though and they may be heard that way . 
  a few days ago , there was some outrage , because cavaco silva ( while approving the just-for-a-few-days-right-gov that just fell ) was a bit too critic of those left parties , expressing they were anti-system and diminishing the chance of approving such left government deal ( ( they are anti nato but regular people do n't give a damn about such positions ; and they are somewhat anti-euro/anti-eu , but they are pretty flexibile there , and they do n't care about it in their deal with center left ) ) . 
  the outrage was filled with desinformation in anti-eu uk media and we had a \\ #portugalcoup twitter movement that was a funnier than real . 
  now cavaco will probably end up approving what he was rejecting before . 
  interesting . 
  so , the big debate there is the `` pro-europe '' people vs `` pro-russia '' people ? 
  that 's really relevant information . 
  thanks . 
  i read that 1972 elections were called earlier , and one could guess it since it was only 3 years later .
