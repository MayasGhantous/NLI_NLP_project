lemon tea , iced tea or * \u00c1gua das pedras * , maybe . 
  and it makes sense and is probably why they are doing it , i just do n't think it will make much difference . 
  like spain does already by fishing in our waters ? 
  they just get fined and next week they are back . 
  from what ? 
  migrants ? 
  they go to spain not portugal . 
  invasions ? 
  look at iceland . 
  smuggling ? 
  possibly , but you could just relocate more ships to the south . 
  i agree that it would be a good investment but everything at their time and now is not the best time , especially if there is a lack of transparency and something that should cost 1m $ ends up costing 1.5 m $ . 
  the problem is corruption in the government , not to mention that doing stuff like this in election time is just too convenient , like the construction work on the entrance of faro that was interrupted for 4 years and this year they decided to rush it and have it finished before the elections . 
  we do n't have money and they are going to do this ? 
  it 's the [ whole submarine debacle again ] ( http://blog.transparency.org/2012/09/03/dealing-in-the-dark-portugals-sad-case-study-on-defence-procurement/ ) . 
  * sigh *, 
  [ those finnish people are unusually close to each other . 
  i 'd say s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 and principe , cape verde or macau , since they managed to stay stable and did n't end up as a corrupt cesspool , or ended up with civil wars that wrecked themselves . 
  holy waffles batman !,

   on a side note , wtf with krakow ? 
  my guess is coal , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krak%c3%b3w#air_pollution ) links to [ a pdf which might be more insightful into the matter ] ( http://bankwatch.org/documents/krakowsmogalert-timeline.pdf ) . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/@38.7065673,-9.1359872,3a,75y,84.76h,70.38t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-hikllhmibja%2fvvhpinxi89i%2faaaaaaabkdu%2fs9p9grhc-ymavuxxym4oaymamwpw9x12g!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-hikllhmibja%2fvvhpinxi89i%2faaaaaaabkdu%2fs9p9grhc-ymavuxxym4oaymamwpw9x12g%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i8704!8i4352?hl=en ) ? 
  how disgusting is that water do you reckon ? 
  and over here in the algarve it was cloudy , chilly ( around 10\u00bac less than that ) , and windy , dammit , and it seems today wo n't be any different :(, 
  turkey and russia are getting more and more similar by the day ... 
  does it work ? 
  what does it link to ? 
  see germany , we have enough of them , come and get them while there 's stock from the low low price of nein billion yuros !, 
  and since germany is the best yuro country we 'll make you a special discount , everything you buy will cost 25 % more !, 
  you heard me , it 's a bargain for 1.25 x the price !, 
  well [ we have one ] ( https://euobserver.com/regions/121591 ) if you 're still interested and i heard [ spain also has one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciudad_real_central_airport ) maybe you guys can keep that in mind for next time . 
   tolerance and respect i do n't think those could be considered european values , especially when you look at some eastern european countries . 
  completely missed macedonia there xd must have traded memberships with luxembourg . 
  why did they even bother putting liechtenstein on the right when they have no data for it ? 
  also , one of these countries is not like the others ( norway is not in the eu edit : and macedonia ), 
  metro or bus ( both lisbon and porto have a metro station right in front of the airport and the buses also stop close by ) , but since you 're not in risk of being attacked for using a cab ( unless there are cab drivers protesting there in which cab regardless of being a cab there 's still a risk ) so you can use them ( although there 's a higher risk of being conned if you take a cab in the airport ) . 
  azores is small enough that the taxi drivers could n't afford to trick costumers even if they wanted to , if word got out it would be very bad for their business and would boost the use of rent-a-cars . 
   i had one awesome taxi driver in portugal last year , who spoke no english , but he made an effort and got me to my destination safely . 
  there are always exceptions to the rules and unfortunately since antral ( the cab company ) refuses to punish/fire the bad apples the cab drivers end up with a bad reputation , some of the cab drivers that refused to protest ( worked during the protests or were n't actively against uber ) were also attacked by the other cab drivers and there 's also been cases of cab drivers defecting to other transport companies ( the ones that cooperate with uber ) , if the good ones defect to other companies and leave the rotten apples what we end up with is essentially a rotten organization that has the government 's help and that the citizens have to pay for it . 
  protests have been happening in lisbon , porto and faro , with the majority of reported aggressions ( in the news ) happening in porto, 
  dammit eesti you are making me want to move to your country !, 
  regardless , i do n't want tourists coming to portugal and having their first impressions be a bunch of angry men swearing and throwing rocks/eggs at them/other people , kind of gives the wrong impression of the country do n't you think ? 
  [ did it , and then removed it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4h0h3p/a_warning_to_tourists_visiting_portugal/d2memv0 ) . 
   personally i think that uber should be regulated to some extent if they want to be a legitimate business . 
  at the same time , it would be healthy to deregulate taxis to the same extent so there is an even playing field . 
  exactly , that 's the best course , but it looks like the outcome will be uber will be fully banned and the taxpayers will have to pay for the modernization of the cabs . 
   you 're not from lisbon but you still thought it was a good idea to spread online insults against lisbon 's taxi drivers where have i referred specifically to lisbon 's taxi drivers ? 
   'cause you 're a neo-liberal lunatic , right ? 
  now who 's insulting who ? 
  [ no drama ? 
  translation :  an uber client was attacked in the pra\u00e7a da batalha , in porto , by a group of `` twenty or thirty cab drivers '' . 
  according to ana , the group started throwing rocks at the legs of the people that where passing by and that where leaving ubers . 
  unfortunately it seems very unlikely that uber will win ( even though the population is mostly in favor of accepting uber ) , the communists ( which are protesting alongside the taxi drivers ) and most of the left ( which are in power ) and some of the right are on the side of the taxi drivers . 
  will do , thanks  edit : removed it over there ( was n't in line with the no politics rule they have ) , besides , it 's a bit of a heated topic ( uber vs. 
  cabs ) , it 's probably for the best ( do n't know if i should do the same here ) . 
  i 'm not from lisbon but , depending on where you want to go , it 's likely that there is a bus/metro/train stop nearby . 
  you might want to hop on to / r/portugal and ask there . 
  they like to rob people blind and are very rude ( there are some exceptions of course , but the majority is like this ) and their service is shit . 
  that 's why when uber entered they felt threatened because uber actually has a quality service for about the same price ( or even lower ) , they do n't want their monopoly to end ~ ~ to ~ ~ so they are getting more and more aggressive . 
  that photo is way over saturated and photoshoped , the original looks [ like this ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/@38.787638,-9.390717,3a,75y,34.42h,94.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snevvgxo6n07f5t3vkhyymw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  they should do a test , ask the refugees if they 're willing to go to portugal or another country that 's less appeasing to them , if they say yes then they are refugees , if they say no then they are economic migrants . 
  by cold ( in that case ) i meant not warm :p, 
  depends on the year , some years the water can get a pleasant temperature ( around 27\u00bac ) others the water can remain at around 22\u00bac , usually the water temperature is best ( warmest ) by the end of august start of september . 
  it also depends if you are bathing in the coast ( colder because of the atlantic ) or in the lagoons ( warmer but the sand quality is n't as good and some parts can get muddy in low tides ) . 
  but the cold ( edit : slightly cold/not warm ) water ( between 22-25\u00bac ) is actually quite refreshing because of the warm stingy sun we get . 
  unfortunately the water 's still a bit cold ( between 15\u00bac and 20\u00bac ), 
  it 's much better to establish safe zones in their countries , what i 'm skeptical about is where that money ends up because it 's not unheard of aid agencies that end up laundering that money and do n't help the people ( it 's common especially in african countries ), 
  and to whom do they give that money to ? 
  assad ? 
  well geneva is also home to many human rights organizations and this is a matter of freedom of expression so i like that instead of trying to appease a semi-dictator they 've decided to stick to their principles of human rights . 
  is telling someone to fuck off considered an insult/defamation or is it just an expression of the feelings towards that person ? 
  good for geneva and switzerland , fuck erdogan . 
   do people eat mushrooms in your country/region other than sliced button mushrooms on frozen pizza ? 
  yeah , quite a few recipes contain mushrooms . 
   do they gather them themselves or buy them ? 
  the great majority buys them , only the people that know what they 're doing might pick them up but even then it might not be worth it to risk being poisoned , there 's been a few cases on the news of entire families being poisoned so there 's a bit of fear when it comes to picking mushrooms . 
   what are the most common mushrooms eaten ? 
  the [ white/button mushroom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agaricus_bisporus ) is the most commonly eaten . 
   what 's the most popular mushroom dish ? 
  i do n't know the overall most common dish in the country but , personally , i really like * [ bifes com natas e cogumelos ] ( http://pt.petitchef.com/receitas/prato-principal/bifinhos-com-natas-e-cogumelos-fid-1506897 ) * ( steak with cream and mushrooms ) . 
   not big but they could probably take the azores and blockade the mainland with the other ships . 
  do n't underestimate the power of the [ azorean cow ] ( https://gunnarbye.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/gunnarbye_20100919_2061.jpg ) they may look cute but they 're psychopathic bastards , and if you get hit with one of [ their cheeses ] ( http://radiopico.com/media/noticias/grande/queijo_sao_jorge.jpg ) it 'll knock you out and you 'll just roll off [ the cliff ] ( http://i.slimg.com/sc/sl/photo/c/co/cover_portugal_azores_view-of-cows-grazing-on-sao-miguel-dd.jpg ) .

   iceland iceland 's pirate party proposed and won the [ abolishment of the blasphemy law in iceland ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33378778 ) last year .

  it 's the first one ( country 's subreddit about talking about anything ) , mostly portuguese politics and news but it also consists of a lot of random posts ( mostly questions ) , as long as it 's in either portuguese or english ( but it must be related to the portuguese ) and is not a blatant shit post or spam , everything is allowed ( [ the rules are quite simple ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/wiki/rules ) ) . 
  protests all across the eu against the measure and people voting to leave the eu , the same as if ukraine joins in the state that they are . 
  but do n't worry , in order for a member to join there has to be a unanimous vote by all member states and one of the countries that is very sure to block them will be greece followed by the dutch people and most eastern european countries . 
  also corsica apparently gained independence from france ( some corsicans might approve of this map ) . 
  the guy at 1:40 makes a good point , why have them bunched up in what 's essentially a slum ( which will make both parties angry and having that many refugees in one place will bring problems ) when you could spread them so that there 's one refugee family per x number of citizens in state owned apartments across the city making it a more manageable situation ? 
  and the guy at 8:54 also makes a good point in that swedes having problems finding a home should also have a right to these housings . 
  this video focuses more on the tories, 
  all i get from this is that the tories are like the disruptive students in class that wo n't shut up and let the teacher teach and other students learn . 
   wtf is not actually dutch , but we tend to copy english phrases a lot . 
  same here ( though not as much as you guys :p ) , what 's your version of wtf ? 
  ( if you have one , ours is `` mas que raio ? 
  '' ( safe language ) and `` mas que porra ?
