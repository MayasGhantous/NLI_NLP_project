  we do have a some pretty weird dishes  the snails are a french thing too . 
  i prefer grilled eel myself . 
  [ cabidela is one of the weirdest from portugal , but delicious . 
  none right now , but moldova might join with help from the romanians . 
  if catalonia manages somehow to gain independence ( very unlikely ) spain will block them from entering the eu , so that wo n't happen , and the same with scotland/uk although the uk might leave the eu giving a chance for scotland to join ( again very unlikely ) . 
  uk , and our frenemies spain . 
  you can always form a federation with portugal mhuahahaha  ^ ( but please do n't ),

  he 's not a dumb ass , he 's an asshole . 
  yeah must be that , it 's not like i did n't use reddit before creating an account or got my news from other places . 
  normal in the time stamp of a few decades meaning there were n't as many news of different major earthquakes ( various major earthquakes in the span of less than 5 years ) coming from italy in the past few decades , at least not in the portuguese media . 
  yeah but , such strong earthquakes with this frequency ca n't be normal , even for italy, 
  what 's with all these strong earthquakes going on in italy ? 
  all that 's left is for vesuvius and etna to go into eruption and fuck the entire country up .

  holy crap [ you guys have a lot of right wing parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_switzerland#political_parties_and_elections ), 
  huh , that 's already happening . 
  besides , why are you complaining ? 
  they bring the most money and i 'd rather have boring old tourists that go to local restaurants and actually know how to behave over the young loud drunk ones that almost always end up destroying property and picking fights . 
  you 'd go insane in portugal . 
  in certain parts of certain cities it 's actually safer to walk on the road instead of the sidewalk , especially at night where some sidewalks are n't well illuminated and you risk stepping on a present ( there 's also the problem where some assholes park on the sidewalk forcing you to take to the road , but that 's another matter ) . 
  fortunately the situation has improved quite drastically in the last years and , in addition to people starting to pick up after their dogs , street cleaners are also starting to do their jobs properly . 
  having never heard of that city i have to admit i was a bit confused when i read the title :p, 
   softer brexit = harder pound hihi,

  did france not send at least one volunteer force to the republicans ? 
  why is portugal colored ? 
  http://www.jn.pt/local/noticias/lisboa/lisboa/interior/reformado-obriga-camara-de-lisboa-a-admitir-falhas-em-obra-2761973.html [ the place in question ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@38.7252443,-9.149959,398m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) basically they built it without any water drains and only added them afterwards . 
  and that is just one example of the many spread out throughout the country . 
  lisbon does get big rain storms in the winter ( parts of the city get flooded almost every year but that 's also due to poor city planning ) , the further north you go in portugal the closer it gets to the uk 's cloudy depressing weather but in the summer it 's generally clean weather . 
  as long as you do n't mind the rain , traffic , noise and rudeness of some people ( basically the same as every big city + crappy weather ) , but hey at least it is n't barnsley . 
  but if they do n't get persecuted then it will create a precedent that political parties can do whatever they want and not follow the rules because if they end up getting persecuted then they can just use the `` they do n't want us to succeed '' excuse . 
  according to [ his party 's ideology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/your_movement#ideology ) ( specifically the anti-clerical part ) , he 's most likely going to experience a though opposition . 
  at least he 's running locally and not nationally ( then again i do n't know how that part of poland is in terms of ideology and conservativeness , then again he did get elected so maybe it 's not that conservative ) . 
  i wish him the best of luck , he 's going to need it . 
  yes . 
  whereas duolingo teaches you how to say `` ik ben een banaan '' :p, 
   and every clear minded person should know that ultra left-wing people can have mental problems too .

  edison and tesla were rivals . 
  would be funny if they formed a company called edison . 
  here 's something that might come off as a surprise to you , the uk is n't the only english speaking country in the eu . 
  and even if was , it would still make more sense to have the standard language be english which is already taught in schools and is widespread not just in europe but all over the world . 
  what 's [ the american gothic one ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/65_185135-1024x784.jpg ) about ? 
  that 's a canadian virus disguised as an albanian one . 
  [ he also made some snarky comments about the us ] ( http://globalnation.inquirer.net/144689/duterte-us-forces-must-go ) , that man has some mental problems . 
  what ? 
  voter fraud in russia ? 
  say it ai n't so !, 
  i do n't see how that has anything to do with what i wrote , the portuguese case i mentioned has nothing to do with refugees it was just a comparison of what could be done in order to keep them from going to live in other places without permission . 
  and if any refugee committed a crime in the host country then they should have their status revoked , that 's pretty obvious . 
  too much bureaucracy and would probably lead to a crash in the markets but it would be a bit funny if all the members invoked article 50 while may is still going `` okay , next year we 'll do it , indeed in 2018 the uk will invoke article 50 , you have my word that by 2019 we will invoke article 50 , i know that all the other members have left before us but rest assured the uk will invoke article 50 by the year 2030 '' . 
   you can also assign those people a certain area that they are allowed to move in ( state/city/area whatever ) . 
  if they get caught leaving that area they recieve a strike or whatever . 
  by `` move in '' do you mean `` visit/circulate '' or `` go live in '' ? 
  they should be allowed to visit other areas , they 're not criminals on home arrest , they just should n't be allowed to go live on other areas without permission while they have their refugee status . 
  with periodic mandatory visits to the local unemployment center ( where they were assigned to ) you could minimize that . 
  if they fail to present themselves and present no valid justification for doing so then they could have their refugee status revoked ( or implement a `` 3 strikes you 're out '' system ) . 
  the same way that in portugal if you fail to present yourself to the unemployment center you can have your unemployment benefits revoked . 
  if they wish to move to another place they could request it and if the receiving city/country agreed then they could be transferred , but only if the recipient agreed , and if they get assigned to a country and immediately leave it because they prefer another without a valid reason ( feeling unsafe is a valid reason , the other country having higher salaries is n't ) then , again , they could have their refugee status revoked because as soon as they leave a safe country in favor of another you can no longer consider them refugees . 
  wait , that 's not a mop ? 
  we have the [ estrela mountain dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estrela_mountain_dog ) ( [ pic ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3c/ed/03/3ced03fe39256700582b5c0ec22b62b5.jpg ) ), 
   if any show up .

   at some points it sounded a bit like portuguese it 's not . 
  sounds a bit like russian or ukrainian to me . 
   a new grant , with a total budget of $ 120 million , will allow public authorities to purchase state-of-the art equipment , for example a local wireless access point . 
  if approved by the the european parliament and national ministers the cash could be available before the end of next year . 
  i do n't think 120 million yuros will be enough to cover the entire union with wifi , it may be just enough to cover a country the size of belgium though ( if even that ) . 
   nobody is so stupid .
