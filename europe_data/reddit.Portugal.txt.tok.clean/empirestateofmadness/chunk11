  save some for me , 
  you want unique ? 
  how about `` you keep the profits ** and ** the pasteis de nata , the population will cover the losses '' , try to compete with that dutchie !, 
  ^ ^ pls ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ offer ^ ^ them ^ ^ waffles, 
  lisbon 's pitch : `` you keep the profits , the population will cover the losses '', 
  it 's green with mold and fumes . 
   i 've tried my best to get as many as possible , but for some capitals i could n't find paintings that resemble the others . 
  i could have sweared that i 'd seen a similar one for lisbon ( [ terreiro do pa\u00e7o specifically ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=terreiro+do+pa%c3%a7o+lisboa+pintura&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiord7o1yxpahxmvbqkhztfdpuq_auibigb ) ) but i 've been searching for it and the closest ones i could find were [ these ones ] ( https://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/quadros-de-antes-do-terramoto-de-1755-serao-expostos-em-lisboa-ao-publico-1630846 ) ( most notably [ this one ] ( http://static.publico.pt/files/lisboaantiga/img/terreiro-paco/01-terreiro-paco.jpg ) ) from before the 1755 earthquake , and [ this one ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uhpqs4akpo0/vptgpxahiui/aaaaaaaagwq/gfmjiqnvaiy/s1600/1200%2blisboa%2barte%2bpintura%2bentrada%2bde%2bgiorgio%2bcornaro%2bpara%2ba%2bprimeira%2baudi%25c3%25aancia%2bcom%2bd.%2bpedro%2bii%2b%2b1693.jpg ) which is a bit closer to the other paintings . 
  i think the portuguese do n't pay one might come from the [ `` fare il portoghese '' expression ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/fare_il_portoghese ), 
  any and all types , there 's chocolate for everyone . 
  for example , one of the more known portuguese chocolate maker ( [ regina ] ( http://chocolatesregina.com/en/the-products ) ) makes a few fruit flavoured chocolates ( orange , pineapple , strawberry , passion fruit , etc ) in addition to the normal ( milk , dark , almond , etc ) . 
  we even have a [ chocolate festival in \u00d3bidos ] ( http://www.festivalchocolate.cm-obidos.pt/ ) every year . 
  thank you , could n't really figure that one out :p, 
  i do n't believe there 's one since each country can have very different culinary cultures . 
  maybe chocolate . 
  they 're not that common here . 
  but we do have [ ham flavoured ] ( http://www.supernapoleao.com/images/img_2378.jpg ) and [ countryside recipe \\ ( herbs and such \\ ) ] ( http://www.supernapoleao.com/images/img_2376.jpg ) chips . 
  just saw the news, 
  another one ? 
  ( feels like [ the last one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_de_compostela_derailment ) happened last year even though it happened in 2013 ) update : [ it was a portuguese train that makes the porto-vigo route ] ( https://www.publico.pt/mundo/noticia/comboio-descarrila-na-galiza-e-provoca-pelo-menos-dois-mortos-1743609 ) at least two confirmed dead , the train was carrying 60 passangers  segundo avan\u00e7ou um porta-voz da renfe ao el pa\u00eds , o comboio \u00e9 portugu\u00eas e o maquinista tamb\u00e9m . 
  translation : according to what was divulged by the renfe 's spokesperson , the train and machinist were portuguese . 
  the accident occurred near the porrinho station . 
  the composition derailed after passing ~ ~ some * needles ? 
  * ~ ~ a rail switch and hit a post . 
  it 's the celta train , which makes the connection porto-vigo twice a day . 
  the train would have left vigo at 9:02 and would have arrived at campanh\u00e3 ( porto ) at 10:18 . 
  this connection is simultaneously explored by cp and renfe , and the trains are driven by both portuguese and spanish machinists . 
  the composition was a series 592 spanish automotive , commonly known in spain by `` camellos '' ( camels ) due to the air conditioning boxes looking like humps , and it was rented to cp . 
  due to being a luso-spanish relation , the ciaf and gisaf ( spanish and portuguese train accident investigation agencies ) have been in contact with each other . 
  no , youtube also has [ a very abusable copyright system ] ( https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/ ) where anyone can claim your videos and then you have to dispute their claim ( which takes time and can result in either your video being taken down , the video monetization being either disabled or diverted to the claimant , you [ being forced to attend youtube 's `` copyright school '' ] ( https://youtube.googleblog.com/2011/04/youtube-copyright-education-remixed.html ) , and you get a strike ( get enough strikes and your channel is deleted ) ) . 
   why ? 
  because copyright and the poor portuguese artists that nobody has ever heard of or the ones that are completely irrelevant these days might get their non existent profits cut because someone happened to find one of their songs on the internet ( which , by the way , good luck doing so ) . 
  that 's also why the government introduced a tax on storage devices ( anything with storage , phones , pcs , flash drives , hard drives , cd/dvds , etc. ), 
  making any piece of tech more expensive and giving even more reasons to buy them in spain . 
   is n't it expensive ? 
  expensive to run a department that all it does is receive claims that a certain website ** might ** have pirated content and then just compiles a list to give the isps without even checking if those websites actually have pirated content ( youtube anyone ? ) ? 
  considering it 's portugal , i would n't put it past it . 
  tell that to our government who keeps dns blocking everything that ** might ** have pirated content . 
  on the plus side , if ever a german says to you `` pay debts '' you can answer with `` pay taxes '', 
  they 're friends with saudi arabia so it 's not like it 's a new thing . 
  france too , if le pen manages to somehow get elected . 
  grass and flowers would n't be that damaging and if they grow too much they can easily be removed ( [ they also provide a neat look ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/british_horse_society_head_quarters_and_green_roof.jpg ) ) , trees though are more destructive because of the roots and the way that they grow which could cause a weight balance problem on the structure . 
  i like the look of this building but if it were grass instead of trees i would find it much better looking , even though it would n't filter as much air but it would also be less messy . 
  looks great but would n't the tree roots start damaging the structure as they grow ? 
  yep , they 're jokes and most of us know they 're jokes and we ourselves joke about it , but there 's always the idiots who take it too seriously ( mostly nationalists who think insulting the country is treason ) and end up ruining it , and all that 's needed is for you to have bad luck and meet a few of them to end up with a wholly different impression on the country . 
  luckily we do n't have many people like this . 
  besides , do n't take everything on the internet personally , some people do it to provoke , and others just like generalizing things , and others just do it innocently without thinking it could annoy others ( kind of like how we constantly say that our country is crap but when a foreigner says it some immediately go on the defensive ) . 
  if i received a euro for every time someone said that portugal was shit or that we spoke brazilian , i would be able to afford a new computer . 
  considering there are a few polish users in this sub that immediately attack users every time someone says something bad about poland it 's normal that some users get on the defensive and immediately assume that you 're going to do the same . 
  depending on where you 're from , the s at the end of the word can sound like a j or a sh . 
  and we use the `` ganivet '' ( though in portuguese is [ canivete ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/canivete ) ) when we refer to pocket knives/swiss army knives . 
  they 're just migrating to afd since afd is more popular . 
  to be fair , bathing in copenhagen , dublin , riga or tallin must be cold as fuck ( it already is fairly cold to bathe in lisbon because of the ocean ) . 
  though you could make that argument for other european capitals like athens or valleta , this article reads like an ad so i do n't expect it to be completely accurate . 
  the part where it says `` suspected '' means that the government can start labeling everyone that does n't support it as a terrorist , it makes a system where you are guilty and need to prove you 're innocent as opposed to one where you are innocent until proven guilty . 
  you can be suspected of having ties to pkk and be suspended just because your neighbor does n't like you and started spreading rumors about it . 
  next up are the chp supporters . 
  atheist-muslim-catholic-pastafarian , let 's call it athepastamuslic . 
  more confusing would be an atheist man wearing a burka with a cross around his neck and a plate of spaghetti on his head . 
  this is what i see :  by padraic halpin | dublin  ireland 's cabinet agreed on friday to join apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the european commission has slapped on the iphone maker , despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition . 
   a government spokesman said that following the cabinet 's decision , it would ask parliament to endorse the legal challenge on wednesday next week . 
   finance minister michael noonan has insisted dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the european union began investigating the u.s. tech giant 's irish tax affairs in 2014 , arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers . 
   but at an earlier cabinet meeting on wednesday he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers , whose support is vital for the minority government , to agree to fight the ruling that apple ( aapl.o ) must pay up to 13 billion euros ( $ 14.5 billion ) in tax to dublin . 
   ireland 's main opposition party , fianna fail , also favours challenging brussels . 
  the government should therefore easily win parliamentary support to appeal against european competition commissioner margrethe vestager 's ruling that apple 's low tax arrangements in ireland constitutes illegal state aid . 
   apple , anxious to defend its own interests , has already said it will lodge an appeal . 
  for fine gael , the main irish coalition party , a broader principle is at stake . 
  it wants to take on brussels to safeguard ireland 's decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as apple , creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country . 
   the independent alliance , a group of five lawmakers , had called for a review of how tax is collected from ireland 's large cluster of multinational companies before it considers a challenge . 
   `` we are very , very keen that from now on multinationals should be seen to be paying their fair share of tax . 
  that 's very important that comes out of this meeting today , '' transport minister shane ross of the independent alliance told reporters before the cabinet meeting . 
   a failure of the alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government 's survival prospects . 
  dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal . 
   some irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down a tax windfall equivalent to what it spent last year funding the struggling health service , and the left-wing sinn fein party has led attacks from the opposition . 
   apple chief executive tim cook warned on thursday that if the dublin government did not join it in appealing , this would send the wrong message to business in a country whose economic model depends in part on companies like his . 
  maybe / u/morpheuspt can help you , he knows a few things about trains and such . 
  looking at the size of those buses and going by the finnish stereotype i 'd say the buses can carry up to 2 finns before it becomes extremely uncomfortable for them :p, 
  except in this situation the cycle is actually beneficial for the economy as opposed to austerity leading people to stop spending which in turn decreases companies 's profits which leads to people getting fired and receiving government aid which causes the government to go further into debt needing to do more austerity and the cycle continues . 
   and some of its cheese is nearly as good as english stuff and that folks is how you start a war with france . 
  but it 's still part of russia , stop being so picky . 
  like it or not russia is still partly in europe so this news is fine for this subreddit . 
  in portugal the parties usually blame each other instead of other countries ( though the left sometimes complains about the eu but it 's mostly because the political party in power in the eu ( epp ) is the correspondent party to the one they usually complain about back home ( psd ) so they try to be consistent ) . 
  add to all that the amount of corruption in some countries which can lead to some security measures being overlooked . 
  portugal the red nosed country ... 
  but the 1755 earthquake [ had an epicenter off the coast of algarve ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/1755_lisbon_earthquake_location.png ) , not lisbon . 
  well , to be fair , outside of it we 're not exactly fond of our ~ ~ investment sucking blackhole ~ ~ capital . 
  oh yeah , i forgot about those , you guys are having some earthquake troubles over there :\\, 
  well , if all hell breaks loose , we 'll be sure to send you mittens and sardines as per custom . 
  ^ ^ ^ fleg ^ ^ ^ stealing ^ ^ ^ bastards, 
   how often do earthquakes occur in italy/southern europe ? 
  they are fairly common ( especially in greece ) [ since the eurasian and african tectonic plates collide underneath the mediterranean ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110419-europe-africa-mediterranean-earthquake-risk-increasing-earth-science/ ) , but they 're usually much weaker than this one . 
  [ italy got hit by another strong earthquake in 2009 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_l%27aquila_earthquake ) , which was n't that long ago so let 's hope that the frequency of large earthquakes is n't increasing . 
  are you going to photoshop them next to one of those squatting toilets ( i do n't know the english name for it :p ) ? 
  wait , the title says `` should ** calling for ** legalization of same-sex civil unions or marriages be illegal ? 
  yes : 27 % , no : 53 % , do n't know : 20 % '' which makes it look like the 27 % of the people actually want to make it illegal for people to ask for the legalization and the 53 % are against it , i do n't speak polish so it could be a mistranslation on the op 's part or a misinterpretation on my part but what i got from it was that 53 % of the people polled are open-minded and the 27 % are the close-minded ones . 
   most likely ( temporal ) return to peseta/lira/dracma / escudo you know what would be odd yet make a bit of sense , if greece , italy , spain and portugal created their own version of the euro ( or at least just spain and portugal ) since their economies are more similar than , say , pt and de . 
  i find the vodafone [ lisbon hq ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_afm8v0ka6ou/tril4stfwbi/aaaaaaaaaa4/69no96pyeqk/s1600/dsc_0462.jpg ) with [ its weird walls ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@38.766943,-9.0976455,3a,65.7y,146h,100.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snp93ljk7adamxpkmj7qdcq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) better looking than [ the porto one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/edificio_vodafone_\\ ( porto \\ ) . jpg ) though both do have an interesting architecture, 
  i tend to associate chavs with adidas and nike , not armani , then again when i think of armani i think of the expensive suits and not the tracksuits . 
  i also do n't get this , one thing is to ban clothing that cover your face preventing you from being identified ( like the balaclavas or the burka ) but in this case you can clearly see the person 's face , and while france does have that ban on religious symbols in public places ( which i think only makes sense in schools or public services offices and not the street or beach ) what difference does it make wearing a burkini or a full body swimsuit apart from one also covering the hair ? 
  are they also going to ban full body swim suits and diving suits ?
