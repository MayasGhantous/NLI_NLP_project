  i think so too , especially considering that i doubt that many italians would be willing to spend that much money on armani clothing , ^ ^ then , ^ ^ again ^ ^ they ^ ^ just ^ ^ might . 
  yeah but the more underground garages you build the more power you waste just to pump water out , and what happens if the power goes out and it rains a lot ( in case there are n't backup generators ) ? 
  underground garages are n't really a very good idea for the netherlands unless you do n't mind having to constantly pump out the water . 
  overground on the other hand ... 
  i thought the :p made it pretty obvious, 
  it was a joke, 
  or fill it with gasoline instead of water :p, 
  32k is still a lot of money , and are you a local ( 1k anual tuition ) or foreigner ( 5-6k tuition ) ? 
  that is only the tuition fee , a 3 year degree is 18k plus money for food , residence and other items that you need which can cost you about 800 $ / month so another 28.8 k $ , the final price can reach 50k $ total which while it might be less than in the us , us universities tend to also be better . 
  in portugal 's situation the price is increased [ from ~ 1000 $ annually to ~ 6000 $ annually for foreigners ] ( https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=*%20valores%20de%20propinas ) ( depending on the university ) and they do n't have access to the state scholarship so they could end up accumulating quite a bit of debt and in other more expensive to live european countries it 's likely to be even more expensive . 
  if i remember correctly , the [ eastern part ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/san_francisco-oakland_bay_bridge,_helicopter_view_4-edit.jpg ) of it was damaged by [ the 1989 earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_francisco%e2%80%93oakland_bay_bridge#earthquake_damage_and_subsequent_upgrades ) and was replaced with the one you linked , that part did n't look like ours ( it was a cantilever bridge ) . 
  [ the western part ] ( http://baybridgeinfo.org/sites/default/files/images/background/ws/ws5.jpg ) was retrofitted but architecturally still looks more like [ ours ] ( http://broer.no/bro/b/b58_3.jpg ) than the [ golden gate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/golden_gate_bridge_0002.jpg ) does . 
  i 'm telling you , this is a conspiracy , the similarities are too much , it 's possible that portugal and california might be the same place but in different universes and i believe the link between the two is daniela ruah !,

  [ portugal has been considered to be a good filming location due to its good weather ] ( http://portugalresident.com/top-hollywood-producers-visit-algarve-region ) ( specifically algarve which has a similar climate to l.a. ) and [ there were already talks about producing some hollywood movies here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tvi24.iol.pt%2fcinebox%2fpicture-filmes%2fonze-producoes-de-hollywood-vao-ser-filmadas-no-algarve ) .

  i sense a conspiracy going on here ^ ^ x-files ^ ^ music ^ ^ starts ^ ^ playing, 
  me too , we have earthquakes , droughts , fires and the weather is very close to the californian one . 
  we even share a vertically elongated shape ( though california is more like a broken rectangle shape ) . 
  [ here 's another one from nasa ] ( https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?p=geographic&amp;l=viirs_snpp_correctedreflectance_truecolor\\ ( hidden \\ ) , modis_aqua_correctedreflectance_truecolor \\ ( hidden \\ ) , modis_terra_correctedreflectance_truecolor , reference_labels \\ ( hidden \\ ) , reference_features \\ ( hidden \\ ) , coastlines & t = 2016-08-08 & v = -16.393602229274446,36.4367034331902 , -2.893602229274446,43.1515471831902 ), 
  this has little to do with climate change , this has happened every year and most of the times it 's discovered that it was caused by people to either get insurance money or for other criminal reasons ( [ about 33 % starts at night ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/fogos/governo-faz-apelo-aos-cidadaos-perante-onda-de-incendios ) ) , add to that the eucalyptus plantations that are like powder kegs and you end up with these fires that get easily out of control .

  all you need to know is that [ their flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/flag_of_cape_verde_\\ ( 2-3_ratio \\ ) . svg/2000px-flag _ of_cape_verde _ \\ ( 2-3_ratio \\ ) . svg.png ) shares some similarities with the [ eu one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/flag_of_europe.svg/2000px-flag_of_europe.svg.png ) . 
   every few decades we get like an f4 , or even an f5 . 
  that 's impressive and horrifying , the most destructive thing we have to worry about here is a strong earthquake ( 7 + on the richter scale ) hitting us , though the last one [ was in 1969 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_portugal_earthquake ) and we do n't know when the next one will hit us . 
  our seasons consist of light rain with the occasional f1 strength storm in spring/winter , drought , fire and swarm of tourists during the summer , and okay weather in autumn . 
  i sense that the netherlands is in a state of perma autumn . 
  do you guys even have another season ? 
  i know that , but if the government starts cracking down on the separatist movement then , in addition to increasing the number of separatists , there 's bound to be some idiots who 'll go the way of eta . 
  do you want a new eta ? 
  because that 's how you get a new eta . 
  yep , a troll , poor things do n't have anything better to do with their lives . 
  oh , and no , you did n't piss me off in the slightest , i saw you a mile away . 
  1st of all , europe and asia are considered different continents in most if not all countries in the world . 
  2nd , i said `` it seems we 're going to have ** at least one ** kim jong un in every continent in the future '' and 3rd your answer makes 0 sense to the rest of the conversation . 
  couple all that with your username and yes , you are most definetly a troll . 
   are you from the us ? 
  you 're not a very good troll . 
  i mentioned him more in a sense that if a belarussian says something bad about him then it 's likely that that person will probably be arrested . 
  i think it 's a tie between him , putin and lukashenko . 
  give it a few years and maybe orban might also join the list . 
  it seems we 're going to have at least one kim jong un in every continent in the future ( especially if a certain orangutan with a toupee wins a certain election ) . 
  the first new party in decades that we 've got in the parliament [ is an animal rights one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%e2%80%93animals%e2%80%93nature ) , so far they 've made some sensible proposals . 
  [ just noticed it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agencies_of_the_european_union#decentralised_agencies ) , we have the [ european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_monitoring_centre_for_drugs_and_drug_addiction ) and the [ european maritime safety agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_maritime_safety_agency ) . 
  in that case it could go to countries that currently do n't have one ( like croatia ) . 
  but my point still stands that it could help the economy and we have had some advances in the medical field [ mainly on cancer research ] ( http://investors.varian.com/2014-03-05-leading-cancer-center-in-portugal-becomes-first-in-world-to-offer-edge-radiosurgery ) so we 're not that far away from the medical field for it to not make sense and ireland is just as peripheral as us . 
  we do ? 
  i was n't entirely sure about the netherlands and maps like [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/world-cannabis-laws.png ) do n't exactly portray what you said , that 's why i though that nl had drug use legalized ( keep in mind i 've been talking about marijuana use all this time and not other types of drugs ) . 
  i think only the netherlands has a better system than us in the eu ( i could be wrong though ) . 
  it 's actually not a very good system as the sale is still illegal meaning people have to resort to shady traffickers in order to get drugs , i believe that full legalization and regulation would be better because that way you can at least ensure that the people are consuming what they are buying and not an unknown mixture that could end up being much more harmful , it also reduces the drug trafficking rings . 
  but it 's still much better than outright criminalizing people for taking drugs . 
  it would be very helpful if some of the eu institutions would move to the members with struggling economies so that they give a push to the country 's economy ( creating jobs and incentivizing foreign companies to move there to be closer to the institution therefore creating even more jobs ) instead of just throwing money at the problem ( which just goes back to pay their own loans and do very little to improve the economy ) . 
  if my country 's government was smart it would also ask for it to be moved here in order to improve the economy ( i highly doubt we 'd actually get it but at least it would show that we are trying different ways to improve our economy ) . 
  i 'd probably replace coimbra with [ madeira ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/curraldasfreiras-2013.jpg ) . 
  [ about 20k $ ] ( http://configurador.nissan.pt/leaf ) , but it 's a promotional campaign , my guess is its true price is closer to 25k $, 
  kids find an excuse to bully for everything and that 's the fault of the bully 's parents for educating their sons to be like that , not the parents of the one that gets bullied . 
  i see this excuse being used all the time when this subject appears and many people fail to see that the problem is n't with the parents of the child being bullied and instead it 's with the parents that teach their child that it 's okay to bully because they 're different and that they wo n't be punished for treating gay kids or kids with gay parents like shit . 
   but this could easily be done with a mixture of fine , community service and a tag/curfew rehab is the most important thing , otherwise they 'll just go back to doing it . 
   i for one think that baltics is the only status we need baltic union str\u00f8nk ? 
  you seemed to want to be included with them . 
  those are our submarine drones . 
  you should be afraid , would n't want to swim into one of those while you 're at the beach , would you ? 
  i have yet to see an estonian complaining that only themselves and the us care about nato . 
  besides , to me , eesti deserves to be upgraded to nordic status and leave the eastern european one :p, 
  as if our army did n't train in [ alentejo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alentejo#climate ) for such situations , we 'll get you during your siesta with a little help from the catalans , hehehe ...

  that 's mostly poles , and they , [ according to this map ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/military-expenditures-gdp.jpg ) , follow the 2 % gdp rule . 
   next step : putting regulations on the internet to avoid being exposed to ideas from other countries , because their culture is not necessary .

  this is genius , how do you get the uk to finally invoke article 50 ? 
  you pretend it was just a fit and offer them some more opt-outs to piss them off . 
   like turkey purging the universities ? 
  --  ( i suspect turkey 's programe might also be suspended given current events ) it 's on my comment . 
  it 'd be pretty idiotic if the ec did n't suspend it based on at least the security risk in the country , let alone the purges . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  there 's probably agreements with those countries that if broken could result in the suspension of the programme , switzerland 's agreement was most likely different than turkey 's and fyrom and made in accordance to the free movement rules , and the referendum caused a conflict which resulted in their suspension ( i suspect turkey 's programe might also be suspended given current events ) , the uk leaving could also make the agreement incompatible and require a new one , and it 's possible that the uk government will decide to just not renovate it or the ec could just not give the uk a new agreement out of spite ( which i think is what happened with switzerland ) , do n't forget that it 's the ec that manages the programme and they get to decide which countries they make agreements with . 
  but this is just speculation on my part . 
  it 's quite a possible outcome ( at least a suspension ** after ** they leave or activate article 50 ) , [ it happened when switzerland voted to reintroduce quotes for eu immigrants ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/26/eu-suspends-swiss-erasmus-participation-for-2014 ) . 
  this does n't mean that uk universities are blocked from having exchange programs with other eu universities , they just wo n't be a part of the erasmus programe . 
  why would they ? 
  this will end up profiting them in the end , and how would they go about doing that in the first place ? 
  on a more positive note , if if the pound keeps loosing value until november , black friday on amazonuk will be a steal ( that is if they do n't prop up the prices to account for the value drop but then it 'd be the brits having a harder time affording it ) , if the # becomes equal to the $ ( unlikely , but still ) then it 'd be awesome . 
  the police asked people not to report on their ( the police ) moves as a security measure . 
  read the bottom text on the image . 
  of course it 's yes , have you ever heard them speaking ? 
  their accents would be a majestic addition to the eu ( even though they 're already in the eu ) , they can form the group of awesome accents alongside the irish ( like visegrad but with accents ) . 
  i also propose that all eu politicians that communicate in english start doing so with the thickest scottish or irish accents possible . 
  well that 's good to know , [ though it seems they wa n't to abolish the wealth and inheritance taxes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_party_\\ ( norway \\ ) #policies ) , i understand that it 's a liberal party but would n't removing these taxes ( especially the wealth tax ) increase the ones the poorer have to pay and the economic inequalities ? 
  [ the dutch wikipedia article ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_vlaamse_liberalen_en_democraten#politiek_gedachtegoed ) ( because the english one does n't have as much info ) says something along the lines that the party used to be liberal conservative and through the years became more liberal progressive ( social liberal ) , is that right ?
