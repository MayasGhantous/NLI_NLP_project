  it does n't say much about its current ideologies though :(, 
  that 's unfortunate , i think there 's not a single party in the world that i actually identify with , the other social liberal one was [ venstre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_party_\\ ( norway \\ ) ) though i suspect i 'll get a norwegian making a similar comment to yours on how they are also a flop . 
  i do n't know how the actual party is , i 'm basing my comment on the [ issues tab in wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democrats_66#issues ) which i happen to agree with ( except for the deregulation of the education sector which i think could lead to a similar situation of the us where people ca n't afford colleges or sweden where the quality of education has been decreasing ) :  some of the party 's most important policies include :  * d66 is in favour of a mixed economy combining market economics and government intervention . 
  d66 is also a proponent of increased flexibility in the labour market and tax-cuts for the lower and middle classes . 
   * d66 proposes to increase government spending on education and innovation , for instance increases in teachers ' salaries . 
  also , d66 wants the education sector to be deregulated and introduce more competition in the sector . 
   * the environment is an important issue for the party . 
  d66 favours more investment in sustainable energy . 
  d66 also favours nuclear power , under certain conditions . 
   * d66 is a social liberal party . 
  the first kok cabinet , in which it participated introduced several liberal reforms in the past , such as the legalisation of euthanasia , gay marriage , and prostitution . 
   * d66 is a proponent of democratic reform . 
  it favours electoral reforms such as a binding referendum , abolition of the senate , and direct election of prime ministers and mayors . 
   * d66 favours a federal europe and more european cooperation on issues such as the environment , immigration policy , and foreign policy . 
   * in exchange for an agreed upon mutual support from centre-right legislators in the second balkenende cabinet , d66 helped them implement social security and healthcare reforms , which included discouraging early retirement , reforming the disability benefit system , and introducing market forces into the dutch healthcare system .

  [ but it can also be a very bad thing ] ( http://www.ehow.com/info_8623736_negative-consequences-lobbying.html ) when you have rich companies and people that lobby to benefit themselves instead of the general population , like a company lobbying to lessen regulations and to make it harder for its competitors to operate in the country . 
  figured as much , was curious if there was another one . 
   heck one of the founding members of nato was a dictatorship at the time . 
  are you talking about portugal or was there another one ? 
  my main complaint with [ alde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_group ) is their support for lobbying but of these options i still prefer them over any other ( [ greens-efa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greens%e2%80%93european_free_alliance ) being my second favorite for their [ regionalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regionalism_\\ ( politics \\ ) ) and [ environmentalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_politics ) ) . 
  if only there was a portuguese social liberal party ~ ~ like [ d66 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democrats_66 ) ~ ~ ... 
  to me any water that you ca n't see the bottom is a no go , even if that means the water is warmer i 'd rather have 20\u00bac water and see where i 'm stepping than step on one of [ these buggers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weever ) .

  that sucks , though i doubt you 'd be able to ( or even want to ) swim in the canals anyway .

  [ fekkin humidity ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=faro+weather&amp;oq=faro+we&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.1343j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) making me sweat with these pleb temps . 
  they 're using the coup as an excuse to do it by saying that these people were involved in it , it 's obvious to people outside of turkey but considering turkey 's internet is n't fully open and their media is already biased towards the government , the people in turkey are at a greater risk of being mislead into thinking that these people were responsible for the coup and give the government a pass or even encourage them . 
   i understand why military personal and police is being crackdown on but why teachers , university deans , judges , staff in the finance ministry , people working in the prime minister 's office , interior ministry workers and the media ? 
  replace them with people loyal to the regime . 
  if they replace the teachers with ones loyal to him it opens up the chance for him to start indoctrinating the younger generations , replacing judges means they can pass tougher sentences for people that are n't loyal and the media is a pretty obvious one . 
  [ hihihihi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaemxfi4bwc ) ( the granny is supposed to be greek and is angry that they stole both the style of the yogurt and a greek name ) . 
  no , i meant expelling members not sanctioning them :p, 
  there has to be a clause that at least sanctions a country that threatens and enters conflict with another member , it 'd be a massive oversight if there was n't . 
  the eu already failed by not having one ( edit : having a clause to kick members out ) , i 'd expect nato to , at least , not do the same mistake . 
  yes i am aware and i do n't see how anything that i said could be interpreted as it not being it . 
  that 's why nato has had this much patience with turkey , but there 's only so much it can take . 
  i would n't be surprised if nato intervened in turkey to plant a less hostile government in case turkey actually causes a conflict with another member , with the record nato has , i mean [ what 's the worst that can happen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libyan_civil_war_\\ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ) ... 
  this world is getting more fucked by the day ... 
  why would you want to fuck that thing ? 
  i mean , some people have pretty weird fetishes , but c'mon man , you can do better than that . 
  considering [ turkey even threatened war with the us ] ( http://qz.com/734174/turkey-threatens-war-on-any-country-supporting-exiled-cleric-gulen-like-the-us/ ) and has been acting hostile towards germany and demanding they arrest germans for insulting erdictator , let 's just say patience is n't infinite and is getting thinner by the day between turkey and the other nato members . 
  the only reason they have n't been kicked out yet is because they 're in a strategic location and have a sizable military . 
  depends on who you ask , many right wingers are apologetic towards him and say that they 'd prefer to live under him , their argument is that at that time portugal was economically prosperous , but they always seem to forget the [ secret police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pide ) that arrested you for speaking against the government , the lack of trust among people because of the fear that they 'd denounce you to the pide and the overall oppression towards anything that was n't male , straight and catholic . 
  essentially an ultraconservative dictatorship . 
  it was supposed to be a joke anyway , but the americans got all sensitive about it :|, 
   i love how you assume that there is one way of building homes . 
  i did n't say that , you 're the one that 's assuming that just because your crappy buildings crumble it means other countries have just as shitty buildings . 
   building styles vary quite considerably . 
  and so does their strength . 
   but if it makes you feel better , americans are fat and stupid . 
  well considering your comments i can at least be sure that one of those is correct for at least one american . 
  [ natas ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/nata ) are cream . 
  since you think you are so knowledgeable on this matter , tell me , how are brick houses built in the us ? 
  are they just a brick shell on the outside or do they also have brick walls on the inside ? 
  are they made with rebar , concrete , bricks and steel beams ? 
  do they have wood in any part of the construction ? 
  [ masonry houses are stronger than wooden houses and can handle weaker tornadoes with more ease than wooden houses . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askengineers/comments/1p9lg9/do_houses_made_out_of_brick_or_stone_fare_better/ ) maybe they ca n't handle it because of the way you guys build your houses there . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  that 's what i was trying to say , we can tolerate higher temps over here because the weather is less humid , but the more humidity the harder it is and that 's why tolerating a 35\u00bac in a dry weather can be just as hard as 25\u00bac in a very humid weather , for example . 
  if you build a solid house then you wo n't have to constantly rebuild it . 
  insurance wise i do n't get it , would n't it make more sense for more vulnerable houses to cost more in insurance than solid ones ? 
  okay fine , `` more resistant to tornadoes than your carboard houses '' house , better ? 
  not really , it 's a mix of the empire state of mind song and skyrim 's sheogorath . 
  i appreciate your offer , but i 'm afraid i must decline , the lack of pasteis de nata and bacalhau would drive me to a whole new level of madness . 
  [ the azores ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/lagoa_do_caldeir%c3%a3o,_ilha_do_corvo,_a%c3%a7ores.jpg ) in particular have the same very green atmosphere that some [ irish ] ( http://wallpapercave.com/wp/g6ha7em.jpg ) parts have . 
  we also [ had a vote on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/os_grandes_portugueses#the_top_ten ) , a dictator won it ... 
  holy crap that 's a big difference o.o, 
  no wonder you guys are crazies :p, 
  a 500kph tornado would be ~ 310mph and [ would fit into an f5 category ( incredible tornado ) in the fujita scale ] ( http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/fscale.htm ) , how many of those do you guys even get , they ca n't be that common . 
  as a side note , on the same scale a 200kph tornado would be an f2 category tornado ( significant tornado ) , and we get several gale and moderate tornadoes ( between 100 and 120kph ) every winter . 
  hey , i 'll have you know our shitty houses can handle at least a 5 on the richter scale ( otherwise you 'd be typing to a ghost right now ) and at least once every few years we get a storm that can reach winds of about 200km/h ( at the end of last year/start of this one we even had a few tornadoes , yay for climate change t.t ) . 
  it 's not that different from us ( the `` too cold '' part at least :p ) , just up it to about 35\u00bac for it to be considered too hot for us ( then again you guys have a more humid weather than us , that 's why you ca n't tolerate that much heat as well ) . 
  okay , we 'll make sure to bring our tornado proof houses along with us . 
  maybe something similar to how [ greenland is not in the eu but denmark is ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/countries/greenland_en ) . 
  in the same way , us summer children know nothing of < -15 \u00bac winters . 
   [ the mhp used to be described as a ** neo-fascist party linked to extremist and violent militias ** . 
  since the 1990s it has , under the leadership of devlet bah\u00e7eli , gradually moderated its programme , turning from ethnic to cultural nationalism and conservatism and stressing the unitary nature of the turkish state . 
  ** notably , it has moved from strict , kemalist-style secularism to a more pro-islamic stance ** , and has -- at least in public statements -- accepted the rules of parliamentary democracy . 
  some scholars \\ [ who ? \\ ] doubt the sincerity and credibility of this turn and suspect the party of still pursuing a fascist agenda behind a more moderate and pro-democratic fa\u00e7ade . 
  nevertheless , mhp 's mainstream overture has strongly increased its appeal to voters and it has grown to the country 's third-strongest party , continuously represented in the national assembly since 2007 with voter shares well above the 10 % threshold . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party#ideology ) idk , seems just as bad or even worse than akp to me . 
  you say that as if 49 % is n't a big number . 
  and how many voted for other parties that are just as bad , like the mhp ? 
  in fact looking at the numbers from the [ 2015 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_november_2015 ) 40.87 % voted for akp and 11.9 % for mhp meaning at least 52.77 % of the population voted for a nationalist party with islamic tendencies . 
  it does n't help the the [ uv index ] ( http://www.ipma.pt/en/ambiente/uv/ ) is at 11 ( max , avoid the sun ) in some places and 10 ( very high , use clothing , sunscreen and uv protective glasses ) in others so yeah , you 'd look like a proper lobster . 
   and we grant them something of a mental free pass it seems . 
  the only reason sa gets a pass is because of oil and the royal family . 
   and a considerable population who are nominally religious and oppose the movement towards religious government seeing as a majority of people voted for akp and the demonstrations by akp supporters that happened after the failed coup ( many shouting allahu akbar , beating the soldiers that had surrendered and calling for the death penalty to be reinstated ) , i sincerely doubt that . 
  the number of secularists in turkey has been steadily diminishing ( many chose to emigrate ) and the government is more and more islamist by the day . 
  did they only benchmark 13 countries ? 
  implying akp does n't crackdown hard on the army and plants akp supporters in them to prevent future coups and keep the army subservient . 
  there 's a reason akp is the most voted party in turkey even with some election shenanigans , that 's why , even if the coup was successful , not much would change , because as soon as the people voted again they 'd go back to the same islamist party they 've been voting for . 
  if the turkish people do n't start changing then turkey will be no different from saudi arabia in a few years , and with a government that controls the media and education , and can essentially indoctrinate the population , that change will be very difficult and can even experience resistance with the government brandishing those people as terrorists and imprisoning them for opposing the government . 
  '' [ those who do n't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/george_santayana#vol._i.2c_reason_in_common_sense ) '' of course this does n't mean you should always keep your head in the past but you should always look at the past to prevent the same mistakes in the future , 
  because scotland still needs westminster 's permission to legitimize the referendum ( otherwise it becomes non-binding ) so essentially they ca n't just decide to declare independence on their own .
