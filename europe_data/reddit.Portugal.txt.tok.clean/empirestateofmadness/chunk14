  they 'll just change the constitution or ignore it like they 've been doing . 
  depends on who you ask , [ technically yes ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/domingo ) , but many people use monday as the first day . 
  edit : i believe the country itself follows the [ iso 8601 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_8601 ) but the day names come from before when [ the week started on a sunday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_days_of_the_week#days_numbered_from_sunday ) . 
  in any case it 's complicated and not really worth the hassle , just know that some people consider monday as the first day and others sunday . 
  at least it 's easy to learn , now if only we could rename domingo and s\u00e1bado to primeira and s\u00e9tima respectively :p, 
  there 's still the end of july and august left , do n't jinx it . 
  it 's been [ more humid than usual where i 'm at ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=faro+weather&amp;oq=faro+weather&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3055j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) ( around 50 % ) , to the point where you 're constantly sweating , at least the temp is lower . 
  [ i got belgium while doing a quick google search ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11054187/spain-and-belgium-would-veto-an-independent-scotlands-eu-membership.html ) , then again , it 's an article from the telegraph so take it with the biggest grain of salt in the world . 
  [ it has to be a unanimous decision ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/steps-towards-joining/index_en.htm ) :  membership negotiations can not start until all eu governments agree , in the form of a unanimous decision by the eu council , on a framework or mandate for negotiations with the candidate country . 
  [ something similar happened with greece threatening to veto portugal and spain 's entry unless the eu gave greece economic concessions ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-30/news/mn-29544_1_european-community ) :  but as the summit meeting opened , the threat of a greek veto over entry of spain and portugal still loomed in the background . 
  greek prime minister andreas papandreou has been saying for months that he would block their entry until greece obtained new economic concessions as part of a special mediterranean assistance package to offset the economic impact of spanish and portuguese membership . 
  and that 's why turkish membership is extremely unlikely . 
  if scotland unilaterally declared independence it 's very likely that spain ( maybe even belgium ) would block it from joining the eu in order to prevent their own separatist regions from doing the same . 
  check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_rights_directive ) , it might help you out . 
  i like it more than the blue/grey one of the bundestag , i find it brighter , cleaner and more organized , different strokes for different folks i guess . 
  it 's very clean , modern , minimalist , with the red accents to indicate where faith can jump ( although jumping on one of those rolling chairs is the easiest way to break your neck :p ), 
  [ brandenburg 's assembly room ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bslfwat.jpg ) looks like something out of mirror 's edge . 
  not so sure about that , i guess we 'll have to wait and see ... 
  and i thought my puns where bad :p, 
  spain has autonomous regions with regional governments ( similar to madeira and a\u00e7ores ) making it less centralized than portugal . 
  but in general , i agree that centralism is a big problem in portugal ( and spain ) . 
  what if another franco get 's in power ? 
  at the very least there should be an option to allow for secession if the portuguese people no longer feel like being in the union . 
  yep , that 's basically what i 'm saying . 
  madrid still has a lot of power over catalonia and other autonomous regions , i would n't want portugal to be in the same situation as you guys ( and believe me , it would , considering how nationalist portuguese people can get sometimes ) . 
  besides , if the proposed constitution for the union prohibits secession ( like the spanish one ) i 'll never support a union that could end up backfiring on us . 
  i 'd very much prefer a sort of mini-eu that moves towards a federation for iberia . 
  what 's a porguese ? 
  joking aside , yeah i would n't mind an iberian union as long as it 's a federal one with high amount of local governance . 
  but if we 're to become another autonomous region of spain with our culture slowly being replaced with the castilian one ( language and food wise ) then they can just fuck right off with your tapas . 
  why did i even bother to read the comment section of the article ... 
  for a fake country you guys sure have the best chocolate and cookies ( do n't tell the swiss and danish i said that ) :p, 
  we have a [ butter cookie ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g_dfzs0-dce/u5s6iwr_kzi/aaaaaaaac1s/1iybj3rrytc/s1600/p5030020.jpg ) that 's called bolacha belga ( belgian cookie ) , resembles a waffle but it 's thin , crunchy and very tasty , i do n't know if it 's actually belgian or they just named it that because of the waffle resemblance ,, 
  it 's not that , we just have a sizable moldovan community ( same with romanians and ukrainians ) so there 's more interaction with people from those parts than from macedonia . 
  seems submarine fishing is a hobby in that neck of the woods . 
  there was no need , it 's clear the french did it because they were butthurt , 
  yay !!, 
  not greeks but [ italians do ] ( https://translate.google.pt/?hl=en#en/it/fruit%20salad ) . 
  the article seems to make it look like you guys call it fruit macedonia but i think they meant that fruit salad ( \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 according to google translate ) is a common dessert in greece . 
  learn something new every day =d, 
  brits do n't really give a shit about anything anyway :p, 
  you call salada de fruta macedonia de frutas ? 
  can confirm , we give more of a shit towards moldova than we do macedonia . 
   `` the submarine immediately surfaced and made contact with the trawler , '' was it something like : `` oi cabr\u00f5es , we 're sneaking down here '' - portuguese sub `` pardon connards you can keep on doing le sneaky '' - french trawler `` oi would ` ya look at those knobs , good show '' - british navy heh , it was n't as funny as i thought , i 'll see myself out :(, 
  wow , that 's pretty insane, 
  as opposed to uneducated teachers ? 
  :p teacher shortage is indeed a big problem ( not just in sweden ) , there are teachers managing more classes than they should and it can end up hindering the quality of the teaching . 
  i 've always been told that the best time to learn is at a young age because as you get older the harder it is to learn . 
  it could just be one of those myths like [ having to wait at least an hour after eating to swim ] ( http://www.medicinenet.com/summer_debunking_summer_health_myths/views.htm ) , in which case my bad , seems the answer [ here ] ( http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/1724 ) explains the situation :p, 
  this is actually a very good idea , the old people get to socialize with others instead of staying abandoned at home , they get to learn new things like how to use the computer in a basic way and learn about the changes in society . 
  the only downside i can think of is the poor teachers that have to teach the more stubborn ones ( though the same could be applied to younger people ) ~ ~ and also the older you get the harder it is to retain new knowledge ~ ~ . 
  was thinking more on a whole governing the country sense and not just the brexit negotiations , what sort of politician is she ? 
  is she a female version of cameron ? 
  do you think she will be better or worse than him ? 
  the only think i know about her is from [ the guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/conservative-leadership-race-who-are-the-five-candidates ) , which does n't really say much : /, 
  https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-06-23-telecom-industry-poised-to-win-big-with-eu-net/ ( regarding the previous vote ), 
   i would hardly call the situation in the eu much better . 
  and i 'm not . 
  in some matters it 's better in the eu ( costumer rights , faster and cheaper internet , for example ) and in others it 's better in the us . 
  i was talking about how us companies abuse their customers ( comcast , at&t , etc ) and the government does very little to intervene . 
  on a scale of 1 to 10 how fucked are the brits ? 
  and why ? 
  ( i do n't know her ), 
  keep in mind i 'm talking about mobile broadband ( the ones that have a hotspot or connect drive and only includes internet ) and not mobile plans ( which includes call , text , etc ) . 
  i remember searching about it a few months back and if i remember correctly [ salt mobile ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/switzerland/comments/44wfky/questions_about_salt_general_experience_contract/ ) ( switzerland ) offered a plan with no speed downgrade but apart from them i could n't find anything else ( i looked at the netherlands , uk , switzerland , and portugal ) . 
  the problem in itself is n't that there is n't a plan available ( though that is also a problem ) but that they take advantage of wording to trick people into thinking that the plan is unlimited so they can use their internet freely but then as soon as that limit is reached the connection becomes so slow that some pages do n't even load properly , technically it 's still unlimited since they do n't outright cut the connection but it 's so slow that it becomes unusable . 
  i 'm highly skeptical that the eu wo n't at least water down some regulations due to lobbying ( aka legalized bribing ) , [ they already did so ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34649067 ) in the not so distant past . 
  seriously , there needs to be measures to fight against these companies 's abuse , otherwise we 'll be no different than the us with companies like comcast offering crappy services at a ridiculous price . 
  it already happens in portugal , did you know that we do n't have a single truly unlimited mobile network plan ? 
  the ones that advertise as `` unlimited '' have a secret ( difficult to find ) clause that if you spend more than 15gb or so of data in one month then they 'll reduce your speed to 128kbps in order to `` prevent network abuse '' , somehow 4g network can handle a country with population of about 10million but only if they do n't pass the 15gb mark , it 's seriously infuriatingly ridiculous and every time it reminds me of [ south park ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0savtot2wa ) . 
  the talks between the eu and the uk have n't even started so the current deals that may or may not be in place may change , and the same applies to the uk , for all i know it 's probable that many eu residents in the uk which have n't gained citizenship would be forced to return . 
  germany 's money , all of it , and then lend it back to them with the condition that they impose the same austerity measures that they 've been advocating for in other eu countries for the duration of 10 years with sanctions as soon as they pass the 3 % deficit . 
  ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ a ^ ^ bit ^ ^ salty ^ ^ towards ^ ^ germany 's ^ ^ government ^ ^ nowadays ^ ^ :p, 
   more than 100 journalists have been dismissed or have resigned from poland 's public broadcaster this year , a measure of the major changes underway there . 
  some journalists say that anyone perceived as critical of the law and justice party is now under threat . 
  shortly after the party took office , it changed laws giving poland 's finance ministry the direct power to appoint the head of the broadcaster . 
  now where have i seen this ? 
  \\* * cough ** russia \\* * cough ** turkey \\* * cough ** ^ ^ damned ^ ^ allergies ... 
  it could be worse , [ it could be finnish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9vnqo0t.jpg ), 
  [ tallest eiffel bridge in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_pia_bridge#/media/file:ponte_maria_pia_-_porto.jpg ) ? 
  ( maybe ? 
  idk :p ), 
  it 's too risky and i have zero confidence in both the government , regulators and oil companies to follow strict regulations , if it where norway then my opinion could be different , but since it 's portugal we 're talking about then i remain extremely against any oil exploration in portuguese soil . 
  i feel the same way about nuclear power , i would n't mind if portugal had a reactor but not with this government ( or even future ones ) , while we do n't have incompetence/corruption on the same level as the soviets , i still do n't trust a government that allows itself to be bribed by companies to uphold strict regulations and not change them to benefit said companies . 
  but the country wo n't profit from the oil , only a few politicians that made secret deals and become members of the company after they resign , and the company managers . 
  if the economy gets hit because of it ( aquifers getting polluted thanks to fracking so you ca n't irrigate the fields or drink it , ocean getting polluted so the fish become inedible , and beaches getting those disgusting [ oil sludges ] ( http://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/700/459/stilltarsand.jpg ) leading do decreasing tourism ) it could ( and most likely would ) even lead to more of a loss to the economy than profit , in fact the only ones that would be certain to profit from this would in fact be the deal makers and oil companies , the rest of the population and country as a whole would suffer from it and have to live with the consequences . 
  true , but unless a deal is made between the eu and the uk then the brits that bought houses and retired to portugal would have to move back to britain unless they gained citizenship . 
  by having portuguese citizenship they would also have access to the other eu countries . 
  they can stay through other means though , like through ireland which is what many are doing but not all brits are eligible so the only way for some might be through portuguese citizenship which in itself is very hard for them because of said language requirements . 
  romanian has many similarities with portuguese ( even their accent is more similar to ours than , say , castillian is ) that 's why many romanians and moldovans have an easier time learning portuguese , but they do integrate better . 
  when you take into account the amount of government/corporate corruption and the incompetence that would lead to the inevitable spill that the algarvians would have to pay for and the fines that the companies would somehow manage to dodge , that leads me to no mixed feelings about it apart for the fact that this should have never been on the table in the first place because it brings risks to the three biggest economic sectors of the region ( tourism , fishing , and agriculture ) . 
   naturalisation requires the applicant to have `` sufficient knowledge '' of the portuguese language and that 's why there is n't an increase , many brits living here are pensioners , most of which do n't bother to learn the language well enough to be able to hold a conversation in portuguese . 
  the thing is many houses here are cheap and old ( to the point that many do n't even have an energy efficiency rating , or a very poor one ) , the newer ones do n't suffer from that problem ( at least as much ) thanks to new building regulations but the people buying new houses are n't the portuguese because many ca n't afford them , it 's foreigners like british , german or french , so we stick with the old crappy non insulated ones that get filled with mold in the winter . 
  we have a saying here , `` uns s\u00e3o filhos outros s\u00e3o enteados '' ( some are sons others are stepsons ) , meaning the sons ( germany and france ) get a preferential treatment over the stepsons ( portugal and spain ) . 
  the ideal situation would be everyone that breaks it gets fined , but that 's not what 's happening . 
  i feel the median wage here represents better the salary that many portuguese have ( which is around the minimum wage , between 600-800 $ ) whereas the average one is higher and tends to be more skewered because of the few rich bastards that make tens of thousands if not millions a month ( some of which belong to the electrical companies ) . 
  that 's where you 're wrong , i live in the southern part of portugal and in the winter the temperature frequently drops below 10c\u00ba at night , while it may not seem much , our houses have little to none insulation meaning in the summer they get quite warm inside ( and sometimes just opening the windows does n't work so we need to use ventilation ) and in the winter quite cold ( to the point it becomes uncomfortable to walk inside unless you have multiple layers of clothes ) . 
  now compare this data with the [ median wage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage#map ) . 
   punishing the iberian countries could be a contentious issue . 
  that 's because while other countries including france and italy have all received warnings in recent years after missing targets on deficit or debt , no country has so far been sanctioned .
