  [ do n't forget germany ] ( http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/05/10/german-current-account-surplus-swells-to-record/ ) :  germany has also long fallen foul of eu budget rules which limit member states to running current account surpluses of no more than 6 per cent of gdp . 
  the current account is set to hit 8.5 per cent this year , compared to 8.8 per cent in 2015 , according to the european commission . 
  but a return to our own currency ( in portugal 's case ) would mean a loss in tourism ( eu citizens would prefer spain because they would n't have to exchange the currency ( while having a common southern currency would help prevent this ) and it would lead to a massive inflation , loss of investment , etc. 
  the netherlands might not be as affected though , but it would still have a negative impact in the short run . 
  the euro should be split in two , one for the poorer economies and one for the richer ones . 
  the same way , the eu should be divided in two , one that strives for more integration and one that wants to go back , one can use strasbourg and the other one brussels . 
  not a [ building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/building )  a building or edifice is a structure ** with a roof and walls ** standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . 
  you could argue poland is the bible belt of the eu , also apparently [ the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ) , [ sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) and [ norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_\\ ( norway \\ ) ) also have bible belts . 
  there 's no clear bible belt because there 's people with that mentality spread throughout the country , a bit more in the interior than the coast . 
  in terms of religiousness , a great part of the population consider themselves catholics but they are mostly non-practicing and they only say they are catholics because their families where , the great majority do n't follow the bible blindly as you see for instance in the us southern states . 
  wait , serbia and oregon joined the eu ? 
  while it has that brutalist look , i do n't find it that ugly in this picture especially the western part of the building , maybe when it rains and all the dirt gets stuck in the walls it looks decrepit but that happens to many other buildings :p the tallest ones in portugal are the [ monsanto tower ] ( http://www.engexpor.com/files/.thumbs/projectos-destaques/ee/640x/torre-monsanto.jpg ) ( office building , 17 floors , 120m ) , followed by the [ saint gabriel/rafael towers ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/7805889.jpg ) ( residential with a mall between them , both with 24 floors and 110m ) . 
  we do n't have many +15 floors buildings , i do n't know if it 's because of earthquakes , the municipal councils not allowing them , or just being to expensive to build . 
  would n't dexit be for denmark ? 
  he must be related to paulo portas .

  for that to happen , you 'd need to legalize euthanasia as a first step , and i 'm not sure how conservative romania is so i do n't know if that would even be considered . 
   why is n't there a place where people can donate their body to science if they do n't want to live anymore ?

  [ just a little bit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_nahvvvmk4 ), 
  ukranians , middle easterns and russians would like to have a word with you . 
  wtf ? 
  why ? 
  who did it ? 
  has this been happening or is it just an isolated incident ? 
  [ did n't a similar thing happened that resulted in switzerland being suspended from the erasmus program ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/26/eu-suspends-swiss-erasmus-participation-for-2014/ ) ? 
   why not chinese , or hindi ? 
  because they 're not an [ eu official language ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm )   and i mean really speak , not badly , and pretending not to understand . 
  let 's be fair here , some languages make it hard to pronounce english words properly without a thick accent because they lack some sounds ( like what happens for spanish and finnish , for example ) so you 'll have to stick with broken english , and not everyone speaks english ( especially the older generations ) so there are people who 'll have problems understanding it . 
  but one thing that pisses me off is when tourists travel to a country without even bothering to learn basic english and then expect you to understand them . 
  [ more people have portuguese as their native language than french or german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers#nationalencyklopedin ) ... just saying , 
  with blackjack and hookers ? 
  it 's a fine example of [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) . 
   well , there are 4 main parties now plus the regional ones . 
  there is an alternative . 
  yes , but they are n't direct alternatives to pp or psoe , for example , on the left side you have podemos but they do n't share the same policies that psoe so they 're not exactly an alternative . 
  what is occurring a bit around the world is that the more centrist parties that have governed ended up being corrupt and now the only alternatives are either right or left winged parties so there is a move toward the extremes of the political spectrum , sure cc says that they are center but i doubt that ( actually cc is the only party which i think actually acts as an alternative to pp but since pp gets most of its votes from older people you end up with what i said earlier which is why cc has n't gotten as much influx from pp voters ) . 
   but nowadays with internet and etc. 
  that should not be a reason anymore . 
  it should not , but keep in mind that spain 's population ( and many other countries 's ) is aging and many old people do n't know how to use a computer so the only news they get is from the tv/radio and that 's a big problem . 
  also , if you do n't have prior knowledge about what and where you are searching on the internet you run the same risk of ending up on an extremely biased news website ( like the telegraph , for example ) and if you do n't know at least a bit about what you 're searching for or just search on one website then you 'll end up with a very different opinion than what actually happens . 
   but so far only two of the main parties have had the `` chance '' to be corrupt , because the new ones haven \u00b4 t been in power yet . 
  historically populist parties always end up messing something really bad , what i said was n't pointed at spain specifically , of course we never know if the parties will be corrupt but keep in mind that populists always say things to gather votes , they want to be in power for some reason . 
  having said that i do n't believe that podemos or any other party that has representation in spain is fully populist because no matter how much they try to convince people to vote for them they always stick to their ideologies , so this point was more of a general point pointed globally and not at spain specifically . 
  my guess : - a combination of treating politics as if it were football clubs ( ex : always voting for the same party even if if that party decided to completely change ideology just because it 's the one they 've always voted for ) . 
  - old people , again , always voting for the same party regardless of ideology or policy . 
  - lack of alternative to the big parties ( as in there is no alternative to psoe or pp that defends the same ideals but is less corrupt , and even if there was there 's little chance they 'd change their votes because the people would think that the new party would be no less corrupt ) . 
  - thinking that all parties are corrupt and so it 's better to vote for the known evil than to venture into an uncertain evil that could turn out to be worse . 
  - media emphasizing the big parties essentially burying and making it very hard for smaller parties to actually get their word out ( surprisingly podemos managed to beat this and get a large amount of support ) . 
  - political propaganda from the big parties fear mongering about the uncertainty of the new parties even though they were the ones that ruled and put the country in the state it is now . 
  - there 's also the unfortunate part that most parties that advocate against corruption are populist and end up themselves being corrupt ( with some exceptions of course ) . 
  we can have the tech sector , but please keep the financial sector away from this country , for both our sakes . 
   euro-sceptic - none really well , [ none that actually matter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_spain#nationalist_parties ) ( for some reason wikipedia scrolls down but i 'm liking to the nationalist parties , the [ cnc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantabrian_nationalist_council ) , the [ dn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democracy_\\ ( spain \\ ) ) , the [ e-2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/espa%c3%b1a_2000 ) , the [ msr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_social_movement ) , and a few other nutjobs that have barely any support ( holy crap you guys have a lot of parties ) ) . 
  their `` news '' is always hilarious , until you realize that there are those who actually believe in what they say , then it 's just sad . 
  fox `` news '' is well known for blaming everything on the democrats so this is not really that surprising . 
   i might try to find a job up there to take advantage of that if they do call a second referendum . 
  best of luck to you on that , 
  well , bugger . 
  was under the impression that if you were a british citizen and lived in scotland at the time of the referendum then you 'd get automatic citizenship , at least that 's the impression i got from [ this article ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/eu-referendum/73897/dual-citizenship-are-you-eligible-for-an-irish-or-scottish-passport ) :  in addition , british citizens `` habitually resident '' in scotland at the time of independence will also be automatically considered . 
  there is no fixed time that determines this -- `` habitually resident '' is defined as `` where the person has habitually and normally resided for a settled purpose apart from temporary or occasional absences '' . 
  does that mean cornwall will also declare independence from england and join the eu since they 're also a net recipient of eu funds ?

  some countries already do share a common plug , the [ cee7 standards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ac_power_plugs_and_sockets#cee_7_standards ) are used in [ most european countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schuko#/media/file:europe_plugtypeinuseupdate.png ) ( the [ cee7/7 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ac_power_plugs_and_sockets#cee_7.2f7_plug ) can be used in both the red and blue countries ) . 
  other countries have different plugs but same voltages and frequencies so they you can just get a cheap adapter .

  that 's why i did n't say it ;p, 
  well , spaniards in a sense that it 's from a region of spain and not spaniard as is castillian . 
  i could have said iberians instead ;p, 
  wales has pretty much been absorbed by england , there is n't as much separatism there as there is in scotland or nireland so they 'd just stick to england . 
  heck , even scotland shares their separatism with catalonia , they 're practically spaniards !, 
  the spaniards are crazy folks , but not even them would be this insane , heck even north korea threatens sk everyday but are n't as crazy to actually invade them because they 'd know it 'd be suicide . 
  last time i checked both spain and the uk are still a part of nato meaning if one decided to single handedly attack another then , in addition to there being repercussions for both sides for not being able to handle it diplomatically , the attacker could find itself expelled from nato and have all other nato members attack it provided the defender invokes article 5 . 
  there 's no way either one would do that , it 'd be suicide . 
  the closest we have to that is the [ 4th point of article 46 ( freedom of association ) of our constitution ] ( http://www.parlamento.pt/legislacao/paginas/constituicaorepublicaportuguesa.aspx#art46 ) :  4 \\ .

  meh , if it stops them complaining about it then go ahead , it 's not hurting anyone anyway . 
  why do the polling places have pencils and not pens though ?
