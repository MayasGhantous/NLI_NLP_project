   uefa 's executive board has warned both england and russia that they could be thrown out of the tournament if there are repeats of the violence in marseille guess what , there were repeats , now let 's see if the executive board actually does something about it . 
  ultranationalism is an element of [ neo-nazism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-nazism ) :  neo-nazism borrows elements from nazi doctrine , including ** ultranationalism ** , racism , ableism , xenophobia , homophobia , antiziganism , antisemitism , and initiating the fourth reich . 
  holocaust denial is a common feature , as is incorporation of nazi symbols and admiration of adolf hitler . 
  [ the mountain even threatened to pull an oberyn on ronaldo ] ( http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/cristiano-ronaldo-be-very-afraid/news-story/2bc0e28a604cfe57d336c03ce1dcba08 ) ;p, 
  i do n't think radiation affects that much the water in the river . 
  when chernobyl happened kiev was in the course of the river and yet it pretty much got out without any major problem thanks to the winds pushing the radiation north . 
  edit : but if we end up in a big enough drought to significantly affect the tagus river then the refrigeration system could be compromised . 
  in addition to that [ they 've been working with components that are made to function in a lower electrical output and some of it 's components did n't even pass the quality check ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/internacional/09-06-2016/central-nuclear-de-almaraz-trabalha-com-pecas-fabricadas-para-potencia-inferior ) . 
  time to start treating these people as terrorists . 
  [ three mile island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_mile_island_accident ) ? 
  it was a partial meltdown but i think was the biggest incident ( or at least most known ) in the us, 
  that 's latvia :p, 
   one thing i 've noticed is that while it 's very easy to find foreign high value coins ( 10 cents and up ) , it 's very hard to find foreign copper coins . 
  same here  with some irish and portuguese coins scattered ( guess this is because i live in a touristy area ) funnily enough i happen to have more spanish coins than portuguese ones ( they are very common here )  if you ever need something that could pass for a euro coin , but is n't one , use a venezuelan bolivar coin . 
  our old [ 200 escudos coin ] ( http://www.lisbon-tourist-guide.com/image-files/200-escudos-coin.jpg ) was also very similar to the 1 $ coin ( and 200 escudos also equated to 1 $ in the conversion rate at the time ) , and our [ 100 escudo coin ] ( http://www.lisbon-tourist-guide.com/image-files/100-escudos-coin.jpg ) , while similar to the 2 $ coin , was much smaller than the 2 $ coin . 
  were can you see the results/when will you make them available ? 
  we gave the english tea and they conquered most of the world , what were you expecting when you gave them alcohol ? 
  indeed , but those changes will take a while and will need to be both in the government and in the russian society as a whole , and there needs to be a push towards it , not against it like what 's currently happening , as i see it , with everyday that passes russia is getting further away from achieving that . 
   i hope we 'll finally have one in moscow as well . 
  with the way things are going in russia do you really think that 's even a possibility in the near ( or far ) future ? 
  would n't it be considered gay `` propaganda '' and every participant beaten and put in jail ? 
   the issue is that the infrastructure is in brussels . 
  the parliamentary groups have their basis in brussels , the nation states have their embassies in brussels , the lobby groups are based in brussels . 
  and the main thing : the parliamentarians are in favor of staying in brussels as well . 
   i would agree with you on `` not being the capital of a country '' if it was paris , london , berlin or rome . 
  but nobody is complaining that belgium has too much influence in the eu . 
  ( plus it ensures that there is at least one working government in belgium lol ) . 
  ok i 'll give you that . 
   and about being central : brussels has the optimal position when it comes to infrastructure . 
  it is directly connected to france , the netherlands , the uk and germany . 
  very few countries have selected their capital based on which is the most central city in the state . 
  i was thinking in a more defensible sense , since strasbourg is further inland and harder to reach , then again , it 's not like the eu is at war with anyone so it 's not really much of a concern :p  but in the end , it does n't matter to me if it is brussels or strasbourg - as long as they finally stop moving and settle on one place . 
  i 'm of the same opinion , 
  yeah , moving to germany would n't help considering the amount of people who already say germany has too much power in the eu . 
  [ czechia is n't centrally located in the eu though ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/c/c6/20070414052116!europe_map_eu.png ) that 'd be closer to the [ grand est ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_est ) region ( [ where strasbourg is located ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strasbourg ) ) and the [ baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg ) state . 
  in addition to that , they already have buildings there so you would n't have to build everything from scratch . 
   ... and put an end to that idiotic monthly move to strasbourg ? 
  it 's a bit hard for us remain campaigners to tell the great british public you 're value for money when the entire parliament decamps like a gigantic travelling circus every few weeks . 
  i 'd actually prefer if they left brussels and moved completely to strasbourg because it 's a more central location and is n't the capital of a country . 
   oh , and can the european parliament be allowed to act like an actual parliament for once and actually be capable of proposing legislation ? 
  is that too much to ask ? 
  100 % with you on that, 
   i think he 's pointing out that anti-podemos people are getting downvoted here . 
  regardless , the difference between * to * and * from * in this sentence gives different results . 
  the way he wrote makes it seem like there is hate towards the anti-podemos people in this sub , followed by a sarcastic message of support towards podemos . 
  whereas if he 'd written * from * then he 'd be saying there 's hate towards the podemos supporters in the sub and give a sincere message of support to podemos . 
   the hate ** to ** anti-podemos people is strong here . 
  to or from ? 
    if you elect ~ ~ right-wing ~ ~ extremists , populist and corrupt parties, 
  going back to xnicolex 's original comment :  you 're forgetting that most young people were thrown off the register 2 years ago by cameron ... disregarding the `` most '' part , it 's true , many did get dropped . 
   and a lot of them did n't know that . 
  it could be debatable whether they were informed or not , this part is unrelated to the news article i posted and i have no opinion on this matter . 
   why is there a deadline to begin with ? 
  this part i disagree with xnicolex , but , again , this is unrelated to what i posted . 
  now going to your comment :   most young people were thrown off the register 2 years ago  source ? 
  you asked for the source about people being dropped from the register , i posted one . 
  and finally :  if students ca n't be fucked to re-enroll when they 're asked to do it themselves , why does the government get the blame ? 
  not what was being discussed , the discussion was about the removal of people from the register ( which happened ) , not about the fact that they did n't re-register afterwards . 
   this is just the independent pushing clickbait . 
  except it 's not just the independent , it 's also [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/nearly-800000-names-axed-from-voter-register-officials-figures-show ) , [ open democracy ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/luke-james/camerons-purge-of-young-voters-from-electoral-register-could-cost-him-referendum ) , and probably many others . 
   the ier changes were universal , not just targeting students , and were done at the behest of the electoral commission . 
  while the changes were universal , the students were most likely one of the most affected groups by the change :  students in university towns were found to be the highest at risk of being unable to vote . 
  canterbury has seen a 13 per cent fall , and both cambridge and dundee west have seen an 11 per cent fall . 
   the process was started in 2009 - before cameron even came to power . 
  but the government sped its implementation :  the government 's rush to implement individual electoral registration ( ier ) -- against expert advice to phase-in the policy over a longer period -- has knocked more than 800,000 people off the electoral register over the last year . 
   furthermore , 1.8 % of people is a long , long way from ` most ' 1,8 % refers to the total population that got dropped , not just students ( like i said , it 's not most but it 's many ) :  `` today we see that over 600,000 people have dropped off the electoral register in the last year . 
  what 's more , there has been a shocking ** 40 % drop in 16 - and 17-year-olds registered to vote ** , '' gloria de piero said . 
  [ not most , but many ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/conservative-changes-to-voter-registration-leave-800000-off-election-rolls-a6845796.html ), 
  basically , the eu is damned if it does and damned if it does n't . 
  this is quite misleading as a country 's law does n't always represent its people 's views , you can have a country with lgbt friendly laws but with citizens that are less accepting of them , and vice versa , the fact that the netherlands and sweden are ranked lower than portugal is a perfect example of this . 
  yeah but they 're landlocked and i 'm more of a beach person than a countryside person even if the water is freezing i like to just look at the sea whereas if i lived in the countryside every spring would be hell to me :p, 
  but they have canals and pretty cities . 
  switzerland or netherlands, 
  hopefully, 
  [ the parliament is already set to revoke the law ] ( http://cleantechnica.com/2016/03/10/parliament-spain-removes-punitive-sun-tax/ ) but considering pp is still in favour of it and that there 's a possibility that they 'll be elected it 's still unclear if the law will actually be revoked or not . 
  that 's the alternative , the state cuts all monetary aid to the churches and forces them to pay taxes . 
  churches usually do n't pay taxes and sometimes even receive money from the government , having a tax means that the people who support that church contribute to it financially instead of the government ( or at least reduces the amount that the government gives to them ) and if you are unaffiliated then the tax money goes to the government instead of the church ( at least that how it works in some countries ) . 
  why ? 
  it makes perfect sense to me . 
  i think it has to do with how garbage is separated , you have plastics/metals , papers , glass and then the other `` non-recycleable '' trash . 
  the first three go to recycling centers and is counted in the data , and the last one goes to landfills/gets burned but is n't counted in the data ( that 's why sweden , for example , does n't get a higher rate even though they burn most of their trash ) . 
   we are talking about a backwards faschist country sanctioning one of the most advance , most richest , and most powerful countries in the world . 
  that 's why it 's so ridiculous , but it would n't surprise me if ~ ~ turkish putin ~ ~ ~ ~ m ~ ~ erdogan did something like this . 
  still , you could have edited it before submitting so that your post would n't look as clickbaity . 
  [ please read the reddiquete  ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_new_submissions )  please do n't ( ... ) in regard to new submissions ( ... ) ** write titles in all caps . 
  ** also , that website requires you to disable adblock otherwise all you 'll get is just an empty white page . 
   in-fact i can safely say turkey wo n't join ( even if it wanted too ) with erdogan anywhere near power . 
  and that is how it should be . 
  i kind of want them to sanction germany , that way we 'll be assured that they will never enter the eu , and it could even have an effect on their nato membership . 
   but switzerland , norway and iceland are almost always included in eu thingies . 
  still not in the eu though so it still would n't be considered '' * in the eu * '', 
  did norway , switzerland , iceland and turkey sneak into the eu while i was n't looking ? 
  those sneaky bastards !, 
  [ percentage of waste produced that is recycled ] ( http://www.planetaid.org/blog/recycling-rates-around-the-world ) :  americans recycle ** 34 percent of all the waste they create ** , according to the latest report from the environmental protection agency . 
  the numbers in that [ infographic ] ( http://files.www.planetaid.org/blog/recycling-rates-around-the-world/recycling_rates_around_the_world_full_size.jpg ) are the same so it 's safe to assume the source is the same . 
  considering not all waste is recyclable , you ca n't achieve a rate of 100 % , and 60 % is actually really good . 
  because turkey , just like russia , is [ partly in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_thrace ), 
  it 's just a feeling ( they share some slight similarities in regards to their relationship with the eu ) , [ though one of their minister has stated that it wo n't happen ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/denmark-won-t-follow-britain-s-eu-direction-minister-says/ ) . 
  another one that comes to mind is the netherlands , [ if they end up electing pvv ] ( http://app.nos.nl/datavisualisatie/peilingen/ ) and having a membership referendum . 
  one that comes to mind is denmark .
