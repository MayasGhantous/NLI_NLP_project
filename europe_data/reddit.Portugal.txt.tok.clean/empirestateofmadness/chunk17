  quick , slip it in before anyone notices it ;d, 
  [ monorail !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/zdoi0cq6gzm?t=51s ), 
  who ? 
  yep , all that 's missing is the [ monorail under the bridge ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/c/ce/broken_monorail.png ) . 
  in that case , it 's not as bad as i thought it was . 
  the dead people problem might skew the abstention results a bit but unless they start voting ( as in someone passing as the dead person ) it would n't cause a different outcome and it 's preferable to have dead people showing up as registered as opposed to having people that are alive being randomly unregistered for no apparent reason . 
   most people do n't need to register because they are automatically registered when they pay taxes or claim benefits well that 's good , do they inform you if you 've been unregistered ? 
   first , stop reading plitical tabloids , especially , those heavily in support of one candidate or another . 
  are you referring to clinton news network 's article or the other one that i linked afterwards to replace it , those where the first articles i found in google to try and explain it to you , i did n't get the news from them . 
   second , there was no intentional voter purge , there was no intentional voter purge which affected mostly brooklyn which so happens to be bernie 's home town , yeah right , bullshit , and the fact that [ a clinton delegate was leading the investigation of the purges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqkmstjtfr0 ) makes what you said an even bigger bullshit . 
  that 's like putin blocking everyone who does n't support him from voting and then appoint a member of his party to `` investigate '' it . 
   and voter non-registration would make things worse . 
  what do you mean by non-registration , because i 'm talking about having every citizen who 's old enough to vote automatically registered without them having to do anything . 
  ~ ~ you know , like what already happens in regular elections , ~ ~ what 's so bad about that ? 
  [ voting purges ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/new-york-primary-voter-purge ) , people are getting removed from the voting lists without being informed they were and only finding out after the deadline to register . 
  wait a second , you need to register to vote ? 
  even after what 's happening in the us you guys think thats a good idea ? 
  wtf, 
  not the jon snow i was expecting xd, 
  [ dodd frank is a regulation that was placed on wall street after the recession ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/47075854 ) :  one of the main goals of the dodd-frank act is to have banks subjected to a number of regulations along with the possibility of being broken up if any of them are determined to be `` too big to fail . ''  if any of the banks gets too big in the council 's determination , they could be be regulated by the federal reserve , which can ask a bank to increase its reserve requirement -- the money it has ` saved up ' and is not using for lending or business costs . 
   under dodd-frank , banks are also required to have plans for a quick and orderly shutdown in the event that the bank becomes insolvent -- or runs out of money . 
  basically it 's to help prevent what happened in [ 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308 ) from happening again , only the bill ended up being watered down thanks to lobbying from wall street and to this day there are still many banks in the us that are considered too big to fail and could lead to another recession . 
  sanders wants to reinforce the bill and is tougher on the banks , trump hates regulations and wants to remove it ( along with many other regulations concerning other things ) , and clinton is a populist who will say whatever she can to get elected and in the end turn to her wall-street donors . 
  [ tyt did a quick video about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynja2zifcas ), 
  there was a comment about it in the website :  `` right-wing '' ? 
  do you think that the conservatives in england or the cdu in germany are leftwing politics ? 
  you think 90 % of dutch politics are not right winged , and even 100 % of portugal and spain ... ? 
   or did you maybe mean extremist , far-right racists , with the frase `` right wing '' ? 
   i really hate the devaluation of so called factual charts . 
  you make something that is quite dangerous , look normal and acceptabel with frases like this . 
  to which there was a response from the op :  thanks for your feedback . 
  you can find the source data in this ny times publication : http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html . 
  it differentiates between center-left/center-right ( which includes the conservative party and cdu ) , right-wing/far-right and others ( including far-left ) . 
  like ny times we highlighted the right-wing/far-right share . 
   our main goal was to offer a condensed representation of the original data not a political interpretation of the controversial topic . 
  on the nyt article there 's this :  the right-wing parties included below range across a wide policy spectrum , ** from populist and nationalist to far-right neofascist ** . 
  so my guess is that if the party doesn fit into any of these categories then it 's labeled center-right and not full right-wing , although this seems to be more of a misjudgment on the part of nyt which passed to the other article posted by aploris . 
  it really varies a lot depending on the place , day , and availability so getting a specific price is really hard . 
  yep , scotland was on my list :(, 
  bummer :(, 
  why ? 
  there are several non-eu exchange partners . 
  only if the british government decided to cut the partnership would it be threatened . 
  i think piracy is also legal/non prosecuted in switzerland , so maybe them , some countries also have piracy laws that go mostly unenforced ( like we do , last time i checked it 's illegal to sell pirated material but not consume it ) . 
  they 're not cheap , the price can vary a lot depending on where you 're buying , but it 's usually between 2 ( when there 's lots ) and 4 $ per kg . 
   bbc iplayer only works in the uk sorry , it 's due to rights issues . 
  what 's the point of linking something that only works in the uk on a european sub ? 
  is n't there a british sub ? 
  woops , always make that mistake :d, 
  personally i prefer the feij\u00e3o ones , those things are freaking addicting . 
  the nata ones are quite tasty when they 're warm and crunchy , you add a bit of cinnamon on top and eat them while you 're drinking an espresso ( or a regular coffee in portugal ) , but depending on the recipe some tend to be very greasy . 
  no , it 's the original recipe of the [ pastel de nata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastel_de_nata ) ( egg tart ) very few people know the original recipe and the ones you find elsewhere are copies with a different recipe and taste . 
  i think the one you are talking about is the [ pastel de feij\u00e3o ] ( http://www.docesregionais.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/past%c3%a9is-de-feij%c3%a3o.jpg ) ( bean tart ) , although its made with white beans , not red . 
  [ even the fins attempted to tap into the power of the natas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikfqrgfokh0 ) , but alas , they were unsuccessful . 
  it could have been worse , he could have tried to sell [ the recipe to the past\u00e9is de bel\u00e9m ] ( http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-26/only-three-people-world-know-how-make-portuguese-pastry ) . 
  argh , the suspense !, 
  so we 'll have to wait for tomorrow then , glad to see it 's not over just yet . 
  lets hope so , also [ the map of austria looks like a sad creature right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/95ja6tu.png ) . 
  [ looks like it 's 51.9 % for hofer and 48.1 % for vdb ] ( http://wahl16.bmi.gv.at/index.html ) is there a possibility that the mail votes will be able to switch this or is it over ? 
  [ he also approves/vetoes laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_austria#legislation ), 
  you can always combine the ~ key ( above the tab key ) with the o key , same with \u00e3 . 
  and the \u02c7 seems to be in the 6 key so you 'd probably have do some shift/ctr/alt / altgr + 6 + s/z combination, 
  the dutch use ij like its a vowel ( they use it a lot ), 
   nuclear is not a fossil fuel . 
  it is not , but that was a bit of my fault because i could n't find a way to word it better , what i wanted to say was that the material used in the nuclear plants ( uranium , for example ) is not a renewable energy source , but nuclear energy in itself is renewable . 
  [ from national geographic ] ( http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/non-renewable-energy/ ) :  ** nuclear energy **  ** nuclear energy is usually considered another non-renewable energy source . 
  ** ** although nuclear energy itself is a renewable energy source , the material used in nuclear power plants is not . 
  **   nuclear energy harvests the powerful energy in the nucleus , or core , of an atom . 
  nuclear energy is released through nuclear fission , the process where the nucleus of an atom splits . 
  nuclear power plants are complex machines that can control nuclear fission to produce electricity . 
    ** the material most often used in nuclear power plants is the element uranium . 
  although uranium is found in rocks all over the world , nuclear power plants usually use a very rare type of uranium , u-235 . 
  uranium is a non-renewable resource . 
  **   nuclear energy is a popular way of generating electricity around the world . 
  nuclear power plants do not pollute the air or emit greenhouse gases . 
  they can be built in rural or urban areas , and do not destroy the environment around them . 
    however , nuclear energy is difficult to harvest . 
  nuclear power plants are very complicated to build and run . 
  many communities do not have the scientists and engineers to develop a safe and reliable nuclear energy program . 
    nuclear energy also produces radioactive material . 
  radioactive waste can be extremely toxic , causing burns and increasing the risk for cancers , blood diseases , and bone decay among people who are exposed to it . 
   also `` renewable '' in portugal is a bit vague and tends to include thermic production for things like wood , industrial leftovers and trash . 
  but wood ** is ** a renewable resource ( you can always plant more trees ) , just not one that 's good for the environment . 
  and on the other side , there 's nuclear power , which < quick edit : uses uranium , which is a non-renewable resource /  ~ ~ is a fossil fuel ~ ~ but is more environmentally friendly than wood ( provided the radioactive material is properly disposed of and the safety regulations are met ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.fodors.com/news/how-to-drive-in-europe-10706 ) it says that in the uk and ireland you can use the us one but in other ones like italy , germany and spain you will need the idp :  do i need an international driving permit ? 
   many european countries -- like the united kingdom and ireland -- recognize u.s. driver 's licenses . 
  however , plenty of countries -- like italy , germany , and spain -- require that you also apply for and carry an international driving permit ( idp ) . 
   the benelux kind of union is outdated , it was a predecessor of the eu . 
  it was also considered to abolish it after the treaty of lisbon , but it 's now kind of an advanced version of the eu for the benelux ( some more common market regulation where the eu still struggles with , like a common patent system ) well i was thinking of something between the current eu and a complete federation/centralized government . 
  maybe more like a confederation instead of an actual federation . 
  or if we 'd manage to do something similar to what switzerland achieved ( they 're a federation and they have regions with different languages and even cultures while at the same time having little separatist sentiment inside so they must have done something right ) it 'd be even better . 
   i doubt spain would do that in this day and age . 
  i think , but i 'm an outsider , a unification would bring great potential . 
  maybe it 's the whole catalan thing in the news making me think that spain still acts a bit like that , one thing is for sure i 'd never vote for unification unless they 'd set in the constitution that a state has a constitutional right to secede if the people of said state vote for it ( would n't want to end up in a union that i 'd latter regret and have no option to leave ) . 
  well ... they 're not exactly wrong ...  but switzerland is definitely a very close second , maybe even tied ;d, 
  if spain federalized its regions giving more autonomy/freedom to them and offered to form a union with portugal ( portugal also becoming a federal state like the other autonomous regions ) and change their name to something like iberian federation/union , i 'd actually be inclined to vote in favor of unification ( or maybe the formation of a benelux kind of union ) . 
  but seeing how spain has treated some of its autonomous regions in the past ( basically trying to replace the local culture with the castillian one ) , i 'd also be very skeptical of such a thing happening . 
  maybe one day they can combine wave generation and wind power ( maybe even add photo-voltaic panels on top ) into a single unit and you 'll have solar/wind/wave power generation at the same time , or [ maybe i 've been playing a lot of cities skylines lately ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sgznogi.jpg ) :p, 
  no , they wrote it wrong , [ the data is from eu-28 , not portugal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:net_electricity_generation,_eu-28,_2013_\\ ( 1 \\ ) _ \\ ( % 25_of_total , _ based_on_gwh \\ ) _ yb15.png ) .
