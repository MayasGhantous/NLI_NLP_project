   as recently as 2013 , portugal generated half its electricity from combustible fuels , with ** 27 % coming from nuclear ** , 13 % from hydro , 7.5 % from wind and 3 % from solar , according to [ eurostat figures ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:net_electricity_generation,_eu-28,_2013_\\ ( 1 \\ ) _ \\ ( % 25_of_total , _ based_on_gwh \\ ) _ yb15.png ) . 
  til we have nuclear plants , nice lapse there guardian , it 's eu-28 not pt . 
  the wars were n't caused directly by europe . 
  the us 's interventionist policy dragged its nato partners ( europeans ) into wars like the iraq and lybia which destabilized the region , they also have a history of supporting rebels that end up turning on them , the right wing governments tend to be more militarily interventionist than the left which have been vocal against said military interventions . 
  as long as it 's pure android and not [ that ugly version that they made in an attempt to imitate the windows phone os ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_x_platform ) then this is great news . 
  i find it quite curious how they 've managed to spin the blame to the left when the european parliament and commission have a right wing majority and when it was the right wing governments that voted to intervene in those countries causing the issue and leading to the refugee problem in the first place . 
  i was assuming that they 'd need to go through the whole process for every change that they want to do . 
  if they can pass all the changes at once then yes the old ( current ) method is indeed better . 
   the parliament has to vote on it ( simple majority ) , then the parliament has to be dissolved immediately , there will be a general election . 
  the next parliament then needs to confirm this vote ( simple majority ) . 
  this is the procedure for simple amendments . 
  that 's unnecessarily complicated , it was probably made this way to discourage any constitutional changes by putting the chance of the elected party not being reelected on the table and at the same time increasing expenditure ( with the new elections ) . 
   it has been proposed to change that towards 2/3 majority + referendum where it needs to get 50 % of the votes and 40 % of the people eligible . 
  this has n't gone anywhere however i think . 
  if the pirate party intends to make several changes this might be the first one they 'll do . 
  oh god , as if it the amount of reposts on / r/portugal was n't enough now it 's spreading to / r/europe too . 
  [ enough already , we get it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jlq8i/portugal_ran_entirely_on_renewable_energy_for_4/ ) !, 
  and spain counteracts us with an old failing nuclear plant close to the border , on the plus side , if there 's a meltdown the wind will blow the radiation into spain instead of portugal . 
   people also refer to the netherlands as `` holanda '' same here , but the proper name is actually [ pa\u00edses bajos ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%adses_bajos ) ( spanish ) , [ pa\u00efsos baixos ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_baixos ) ( catalan ) , [ pa\u00edses baixos ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%adses_baixos ) ( portuguese and galician ) , even though most people just say holanda . 
  speaking of romania , [ they could have definitely made it to the top 10 if they were n't removed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqp3405lni ) . 
  how long do you think it will take until she also suffers an `` accident '' ? 
  spain is empty inside , they need therapy . 
  the best song in the entire show , love love peace peace !, 
  exactly , it was the only song that had a message and emotion put into it ( serbia also had one with a message but the emotion was n't really noticeable and the song was poorer ) , it was the only song that had a strong meaning [ and was n't just a crappy pop song ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/11/jamalas-ukraine-eurovision-song-stirs-up-russia/ ) :  russian officials and some politicians in crimea have complained that the song was intended to denigrate russia . 
  but the geneva-based organisers decided the song was not in breach of the competition 's rules against political speech . 
   '' ** musicians should express their feelings , their real feelings , not sing meaningless words like we hear all the time ** '' , said the artist , defending the song in stockholm . 
  that 's what made it stand out and win . 
  and if next year we have a politically charged eurovision so be it . 
  [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/no1v1-2hz6g?t=2h36m27s ) was pretty good, 
  did the [ armenia incident ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/05/12/armenia-faces-eurovision-ban-for-flag-waving/ ) go anywhere or did they let it pass ? 
  [ this one fits better ] ( http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mtywndy3mdu.mta4ndgxotk*mji4oteyodc\\ ( mtq2mzgzntc ~ ! br * otgwntewmq.mje4nzqyotk \\ ( mtiz \\ ) mw ), 
  imo both are ugly and even a bit creepy , the first one looks like something you 'd see in courage the cowardly dog , and the second one looks like a kid 's drawing . 
  row , row , row your mania gently down the danube merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily life in the rowmania, 
  disliked by who ? 
  woops , meant to say europe , not eu :p, 
  if they win i think they have to choose a country in europe to host the next eurovision . 
   do you think they should be permanent ? 
  sure !, 
  why not ? 
  the more dank songs the merrier !, 
  :d besides , eurovision does n't have a requirement for the country to be in ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ europe , i believe they just have to be a part of the [ ebu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) . 
  australia is in between germany and italy , 
   ( youtube stream is not available ) let me guess , gema ? 
  you 're one to talk traitor ... we voted for you !, 
  from what i gather , it 's just an advertisement on the outside of the bus , not preachers annoying people inside it , so technically it 's still a form of shitty advertising . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  forty hobbit-sized australians easily , i 'd just bring a bucket of vegemite and a bunch of toasts and throw them in the middle of the horde and watch them fight for it  , 
  and with an high pitched voice yelling `` oi cunt ! '', 
  that it would , and while you 're at it take san marino too , then the entire peninsula will be united ;p, 
  heh , while i do n't particularly like whole the idea of the vatican , if italy were to annex it , the action would still be condemned by a lot of nations and could incur sanctions ( especially from the very religious nations ) and italy could become a pariah , other countries could also use it as an excuse to annex parts of other countries ( for example , country-x annexes part of country-y , the eu condemns it and country-x fires back by calling the eu hypocrite because it did n't condemn italy when it did the same to the vatican ) . 
  even though i do n't like it , the vatican still has quite a bit of influence around the world and that influence could mean that annexing that tiny piece of territory could cause quite a bit of trouble for italy . 
  maybe when the churches/mosques/etc . 
  start losing influence worldwide then , maybe , italy might be able to make a case for annexing the vatican without many people getting riled up about it . 
  even if it was , nowadays annexing a country ( or even part of one ) is viewed very badly in the eyes of the international community . 
  then that 's a secularization ( or lack of ) problem of italy , but putting that aside , even if they wanted to remove the pope , they could n't because he 's in another country , it does n't help that that country is in the middle of your capital though , but hey on the bright side it gets more tourists , on the darker side it also works like the centers of reformation in eu4 ( just keeps converting the area around it ) . 
  the vatican is a separate country from italy , just like san marino and monaco . 
  are you defending the annexation of a country ( especially one that is also the seat of the catholic faith ) ? 
  imagine the outrage from the catholics world wide . 
   i would say the focus should be the grid . 
  well of course , that too , you kind of have to balance between a lot of things ( storage , production , infrastructure , etc ) if you focus too much on one and leave the others then you end up with an inefficient system . 
  if there is going to be an investment in renewables then there really needs to be an investment in battery/power storage technology , batteries are still very polluting to produce , have crappy storage and degrade relatively quick . 
   and portugal for lack of interest and money too , in fact [ our national tv channel \\ ( rtp \\ ) is only going to show it because they offered a cheaper deal ] ( http://www.jn.pt/cultura/media/ntv/interior/rtp-volta-atras-afinal-habemus-eurovisao-5128567.html ) . 
  yeah , just look at that pink building , it 's blinding .

  cova da moura is one of ( if not the ) worst social neighborhoods in the country , it 's hardly a depiction of the entire country , but i wo n't deny that [ there is racism in portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism_in_portugal#racism_and_violent_crime_rise ) , but we also have anti discrimination laws , does poland also have them ? 
  what about [ this ] ( https://www.neweurope.eu/article/polands-ombudsman-warns-growing-racism/ ) ? 
  were have i , in my comment , even mentioned illegal immigrants ? 
  when i say racist/xenophobic , i 'm talking about [ cases like these ] ( http://portugalresident.com/portuguese-students-offered-protection-in-poland-after-racist-attack ) , not just immigrants ( the ones from other eu countries and others that are legally in the country ) . 
  edit : forgot to add :  present gov 's actions are a swan song . 
  [ yeah right ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/08/polish-abortion-ban-law-poland ), 
  your sarcasm does n't help make a case for your side , it only shows that when someone points something out about your country , instead of debating , [ you attack the other person 's opinion ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bigotry ) while at the same time playing the victim card saying that the others always hate on poland . 
  ~ 188cm in the much superior metric scale . 
  imo : romania is actually an example of a eastern european country moving towards a more western society and , while you guys still have a few problems in regards to church influence in the state and some social issues , at least you guys are trying to resolve it , in fact i have n't seen this kind of attitude towards romania lately . 
  another fine example of it is estonia , which , with a few changes here and there , could even be considered a western nation ( even though their wages are low their society is much closer to a western one ) , estonia also does n't seem to get this kind of attitude from western countries ( at least not as much ) . 
  poland is the reverse though , there is no attempt to stop church influence in the state and to promote a society that is n't racist/bigoted/xenophobic , in fact it seems that the government is going in reverse ( becoming more racist/bigoted/xenophobic and giving more and more influence to the church ) , and in poland 's case this kind of attitude has indeed been increasing . 
  the machines would have to be thoroughly tested before the voting day and it would be encased so that only the slot for the id card is accessible and a mechanism implemented to prevent someone from inserting a malware infected id card . 
  if you could n't make machines tamper proof then banks would n't have atms . 
  you can always implement redundancy mechanisms , you can save the votes locally on the machine in addition to sending it to the database or even have the machine print the votes out out as someone votes ( essentially replacing a pen ) as a backup , for example , on the computer at home you could have a website with a two way authentication where the vote is recorded and you can consult it anytime and change it before the deadline ( closing of the polls ) but when it 's cast into the voting database it 's anonymous, 
  only if the data would be unencrypted , if it was that easy to hack encrypted stuff then no government would dare to use the internet . 
  maybe [ this news article ] ( http://www.tsf.pt/sociedade/interior/um-tunel-de-seguranca-5159305.html ) can help you on some of those aspects ( use google translate ),

  with the amount of divorces they have with denmark , finland and norway , it 's surprising sweden has n't turned into a crazy cat country . 
   why is vilnius called `` portugal '' ? 
  what ? 
  is it ? 
  why ? 
  switzerland , the pedo-stash country . 
  has a nice ring to it does n't it ? 
  why does switzerland look like a moustache ? 
  that part i got , the one i did n't get was robertmurz 's response to thelastgoodemperor, 
  ok then , looks like i have a german sense of humour , because the only one i knew was joking was temporaryeconomist . 
  do tell where 's the joke ? 
  he said the eu would never accept norway and iceland , not the other way around , that 's why what he said does n't make much sense , especially considering i 'm pretty sure none of the eu members are against letting iceland or norway in . 
  are n't you guys constantly in a state of picking on each other ? 
  as long as it 's not submarines we 're okay with the investment,

  are n't oranges called portakal in turk ? 
  so in addition to burning the french flag instead of the dutch , now they are essentially stabbing the portuguese . 
  mainland yes , the autonomous islands also have their separatist movements ( albeit just being some random people ) madeira being the most known one because its former governor was himself a separatist .
