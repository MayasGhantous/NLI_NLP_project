  edit : also oliven\u00e7a / olivenza would go back to us in this map, 
  and croatia , and russia , and yugoslavia ... 
  eh , close enough, 
   not sure why you 're getting so upset i 'm not ? 
  not making excuses for them but saying `` they 're from turkey so what did you expect lol '' makes it seem like you are putting all the turks in the same pot including the ones that actually have a mind and are pissed of at this situation . 
  as if this was something exclusive to turkey ... their nationalities do n't dictate their personalities , every country has its share of morons . 
  it just so happens this topic is specifically about the idiots on turkey 's side . 
  for that to be accurate he would need to have one in the first place, 
  well those `` protesters '' are n't exactly known for having much on the intelligence department , at least they got the colors right so a + for effort . 
  i do n't think that 's possible for him, 
  i 'll take the one on the left please, 
  says the fake german, 
  but you are our colony , how are you going to conquer us when we already control you ? 
  germany is the biggest country in the eu in terms of population and the users are more active posting stuff about germany , it 's not that there are too many german posts it 's that there are too few posts from other countries, 
  someone should tell them that it 's better see high-voltage lines than not being able to see anything because of the smog . 
  germany you got some ` splaining to do !, 
  the locals are n't too fond of it though , especially considering finding long term rental at acceptable prices ( prices that correspond with the average salaries of the city ) is becoming harder by the day forcing many to move the the outskirts which in turn causes much higher traffic , and more strain on the public transport network which is already quite overcrowded in lisbon , it also increases people 's stress levels . 
  [ we have a similar thing ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6439397,-8.656429,290a,20y,358.05h,2.5t/data=!3m1!1e3 ) in aveiro for pedestrians over the canal, 
   if you have trouble identifying an `` official '' video , most spinoffs do n't have the trump accent that 's exactly how i 've been differentiating them . 
  netherlands . 
  nuff said ( love those crazy bastards ), 
  indeed, 
  these have been losing quality over time , now they 're more annoying to watch than entertaining, 
  ( pardon my google translate ), 
  now i kind of wish every country did the `` in case you want to bomb us this is us on the map '' bit . 
  oh cool never seen something like that , given the link you gave , it 's a [ graduation tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graduation_tower ), 
   * i hope that 's the right word , large wooden constructions with salt water running down , creating a healing sort of environment , much like near the sea you mean salinas ? 
  they 're called [ salt evaporation ponds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salt_evaporation_pond ) in english, 
  most likely high traffic , yuge traffic , it 's great it really is . 
  it 's not ? 
  [ the trump parody videos ] ( http://everysecondcounts.eu/ ), 
  it is but it does n't store your data so you get google 's algorithm and the privacy , unfortunately it 's not a complete substitute for google ( for that you 'd need also a video section competing with youtube and other services but then privacy would go out of the window again ) but as a simple search engine it 's quite good, 
  i gave it a try but it still lacks some things , same thing with switching from windows to linux . 
  i 'm just used to using google so i 'm sort of `` stuck '' with it unfortunately , even though i 'm not too fond of it . 
  not even duckduckgo ? 
   and closed [ it 's still open ] ( https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928 ) , the deadline is 29th of may, 
  that was quick, 
  well , i did this in less than 5 minutes and the most of that time was searching for a map with borders that did n't look like absolute crap ... so that 's what you get from a lazy portuguese :p, 
  the top of mexico could use a little rain though :p, 
  you mean something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rphbwdx.jpg ) ? 
  the problem now is where to fit those big ass countries on the sidebar map, 
  do n't forget canada , the eu-maple-syrup-taco-kangaroo alliance will be yuge !, 
  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/chicago-convulsed-by-violence-confronts-trumps-twitter-threat.html?_r=0 https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/24/donald-trump-threatens-send-feds-chicago-response-bill-o-reilly-segment/215115 http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-bill-oreilly-feds-chicago-2017-1, 
  frankly i have never heard of pence 's foreign policies but given his conservativeness i doubt he would be too keen on making deals with the `` amoral '' european countries ( the more liberal ones ) unless their governments were also very conservatives . 
  because days ago does n't translate into the future ( he was recently elected ) , things do n't happen from one day to the next , as the idiot cracks down more and more and starts censoring and removing more and more rights , the people will also get angrier . 
  pence is probably just as bad if not worse than trump , though . 
  i would n't put it past that a lot of trump 's positions are actually pence 's , heck the idiot threatened to put chicago under martial law just because he saw some shitty crime graphs on bill o'reilly , he did n't even investigate if they were true or not . 
  given that the us is looking more like an authoritarian state by the day with arrests on peaceful protesters and journalists , censoring of scientific investigations and propagation of `` alternative '' facts , i would n't be surprised if a civil war happened , the people are getting pissed off and with good reason . 
  the moment you forbid the right to protest peacefully some people will feel the need to resort to more violent forms of protest to send their message . 
  so just like our `` social democrats '', 
  oh god , it 's starting !, 
  everybody to their bunkers before it 's too late !, 
  what 's next ? 
  british cuisine ? 
  meanwhile , [ yesterday it snowed in the algarve ] ( http://www.sulinformacao.pt/2017/01/ja-cai-neve-no-algarve-com-videos/ ) ( it 's a rare occasion and it did n't really cover anything like [ 1954 ] ( http://www.sulinformacao.pt/2014/02/o-algarve-cobriu-se-de-neve-ha-60-anos/ ) , but still ... ) . 
  thanks , that 's what i wanted to know , 
  what is your party 's position regarding the eu ? 
  how are there still people who believe these guys are n't neonazis ? 
  actually , nevermind , that does n't surprise me in the least . 
  aww , thanks mate but the chances are very slim , while we do get the sun for the solar panels on top of their facility , the large lithium deposits and the relatively cheap labour , unfortunately our location is n't very favorable . 
  it 'd be awesome if we did get it , but spain has a higher chance of getting it . 
  or portugal , heck you could even build half the facility in spain and the other half in pt ( between elvas and badajoz for example ) , we do n't mind , 
  still has n't though, 
   beautiful sunny imperial capital this map was clearly made by lisboners . 
  edit :  true capital northern master race now i 'm confuzzled : /, 
  i think the chances of the usa falling apart or entering a civil war is higher than the eu breaking apart , last time i checked there were a few riots after their elections, 
  [ hell freezes every year ] ( http://www.messynessychic.com/2014/04/30/welcome-to-hell-the-norwegian-town-that-freezes-over-every-winter/ ) , it 's not like it 's an unusual occurence , 
  i do n't know about other portuguese people but i sometimes refer to them as a\u00e9reos, 
  our telecom companies would never allow the government to so such a thing because it could lead to some people rescinding their contracts with them , in fact the first thing the telecom companies did when the whole tdt went on was offer a 10 $ / month package with just the 4 basic channels ( rtp 1 and 2 , sic and tvi ) and advertised it as an easy solution for people who do n't want to go through the hassle of getting a new tv ( even though you only needed a new box but the old people did n't know about that ), 
  we also have that stupid channel limitations , our government wanted to add more channels but the big two broadcasters ( sic and tvi ) immediately jumped on it saying it was n't possible ( it still went through though ) , if the technology was so limited then why bother upgrading it in the first place ? 
  you look at spain and they have about 20 channels with no problems and here we ca n't handle more than 7 ( none of which is hd ) ... 
  10 times ? 
  that 's just last year . 
  when portugal switched to [ dtt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_terrestrial_television_in_portugal ) a lot of people also went crazy over it saying they would be forced to purchase set-top boxes/tvs/etc just to watch free tv and that the elderly would suffer from it . 
  fast forward a few years later and almost nobody cares about it anymore even though the service is actually shittier than before ( before , a loss of signal meant a little static on the tv but now a loss of signal means the image and sound gets all corrupted and pretty much unwatchable ), 
  only that `` from spain , neither good winds nor good marriages '' i actually never read don quixote :p, 
   delirious dudes attacking windmills now i 'm curious , what happened ? 
   this solution is reminiscent of the \u00d8resund which connects the danish capital of copenhagen to the swedish capital of malm\u00f6 . 
  you heard it here first swedes , malm\u00f6 is now your capital . 
  also , stuff like [ this ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/editor/j1bg1wx-a5m5dfrufui_vvdns5yplezja39lyf6ofsu.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/editor/m9r6ktpoxey_ajnistzqgznpkpvghn5ulfazrhcriq4.jpg ) would require anchors otherwise the force of the currents would break apart the tunnels, 
  i think even continentals love your queen . 
  no idea , if this is by percentage of population then it might make sense since the actual population of algarve is n't that big we just get lots of tourists so it tends to get quite inflated . 
  but even then , everytime there 's an homicide , the old ladies ( our version of cctv systems ) spread the news faster than the actual media so everybody knows about it , and it does n't happen that often . 
  you do know i was joking , right ? 
  overjoyed that he wo n't have to deal with those idiots anymore followed by the realization that next year he 's going to get another batch of idiots leading him to rethink his life choices ? 
  i only see 1 european language ( germany ) . 
  - english is north american - mandarin , russian , japanese and hindi are asian - french and arabic are african - spanish and portuguese are south american , 
  take that spain !, 
  wait , they 're here too ... uhh ... take that romania !, 
  i know austria is cold but i never though it 'd have penguins, 
  yes , our pm and president both usually make a christmas/new year message, 
  [ one way to divide the world ] ( http://www.essential-humanities.net/img/history/his109.png ), 
   let 's see if the voters are smart enough to make the right judgement now . 
  hahahaha ... yeah , that 's not happening . 
  i think it 's also know to as [ ivory coast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivory_coast ) , i mean , they do have the same fleg, 
  you try travelling hours with such a delicious pastry and not eat it . 
  it 's so colourful and funky , it looks like it could be one of google 's hq . 
  the photo on the left looks like something out of fallout, 
   two steaks , sandwiched together with cheese and a slice of ham , all coated in bread crumbs and fried up into a gooey , meaty plateful . 
  what exactly is the difference between cachopo and cordon bleu ?
