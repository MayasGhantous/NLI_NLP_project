  '' ( not as safe language ) but we do say `` the fuck ? '', 
  a lot ) . 
  til you say wtf in both english and dutch . 
  props to him for managing to keep a straight face the entire time , i bet it helps that he was actually pissed at erdogan and that he 's a comedian but still there had to be someone at least grinning behind the scenes . 
  nah , i just though of adding a ( slightly related ) random fact :p, 
   politicians should lead , and govern with the population 's best interests at heart ( with their consent ) , not follow and give people what they want . 
  it just so happens that a lot of the times those politicians put their own interests above the people 's , and the people have a right to protest when their voices are not being heard , otherwise it 'd be a dictatorship . 
  the eu acted in the wrong by making this deal secret , it opened the doors to speculations ( and made people assume that it had to have had something bad otherwise it would n't have been secret ) and now you have articles that say the ttip is great and will bring lots of jobs and others that say it will cause problems to our workers/consumers rights and could put at risk the european environmental standards ( i found [ this article ] ( http://one-europe.info/the-transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership ) which i think maintains a certain level of neutrality towards the matter ) . 
  it does n't matter , most of the territory still belonged to it and we 're already referred to [ lusitanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitanic ) so it 's not like it would make much of a difference  the most important one ( above douro river ) cheeky bastard , 
   probably because neither parties wanted to rename the whole country from a region it would n't be the country having to rename itself but just one of the regions . 
   one which i suppose was not very large . 
  both regions are/where actually quite big ( the spanish one is an autonomous region and ours was the region that encompassed the metropolitan area of lisbon and its surrounding ) but their names where never considered ambitions of invading the other ( it was just a name ) . 
  we stopped calling it estremadura and now just refer to the area as lisbon ( which includes the lisbon district and the northern part of the set\u00fabal district ) . 
  not so fun fact : both [ portugal ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/estremadura ) and [ spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extremadura ) have had a region called extremadura/estremadura at the same time ( before we changed it ) , never really caused much of a stir between the two countries . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfvlab4sdhk ), 
  well then that 's good for your state , have they also been releasing the people that were arrested smoking pot ? 
  something simple , like : `` the great and totally relevant republic of lusitania , land of the portuguese , explorers of the seas , producers of cork and wine , and the true western europeans '' or , in it 's shorter version , `` tgatrrollotpeotspocawattwe '' . 
  jokes aside , lusitania is fine . 
  why would you build it out of wood in the first place ? 
  it 's much heavier than aluminium . 
  that 's after a night of drinking with the dutch embassador of eesti . 
  they do have some nice looking furniture ( and some not as nice looking ones ) , but still , i 'd expect something more like [ this ] ( http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2010/03/12/omafiets-gt-studio_t479.jpg?ad14627618f647f3902aa65ed5ac8237c798b1ef ) for the dutch embassy . 
  you 'd think the dutch would have a better taste in bicycles , this looks like it was bought in ikea . 
  it 's hypocrisy, 
  a lot of police here are usually hostile and biased towards gypsies and blacks . 
  but the majority of cases of police violence do occur in rough neighborhoods and in sports events or in protests , which is something common in many other countries . 
  actually the [ uk 's tories and lib dems are in favor of the ttip ] ( http://www.waronwant.org/media/ttip-and-2015-election-where-do-parties-stand ) so even if you guys leave ( and the tories remain in power ) there 's still a chance of a similar ( or worse ) deal . 
  every time i see an article about someone resigning because of the panama papers that song jumps immediately into my head xd, 
  dammit !, 
  my plan to release criminals into the streets of the us failed but i 'll get you next time , i swear on me mum !, 
  instead of building more prisons or paying for private prisons ( which , by the way , are horrible ) , you guys could enact a ** retroactive ** law decriminalizing marijuana ( that alone could relieve a lot of the overcrowding ) , change your system from punishment to rehabilitation and increase funding in schools ( including funding some courses for adults to help them get back on their feet ) and help poorer communities . 
   but that used to be a very very dangerous neighbourhood , basically a favela , where police could easily get shot if they gave people they approached an opening still is, 
  we know that we have problems with police brutality and prison overcrowding but it never reaches a point where cops start killing people ( like what happens in the us ) and this is quite hypocritical coming from the us , which also has lots of problems with corruption , police brutality and prison overcrowding . 
  [ they also pointed out police brutality and prison overcrowding in portugal ] ( http://observador.pt/2016/04/14/eua-voltam-apontar-condicoes-das-cadeias-abusos-policiais-portugal/ ) ( which , coming from the us , is extremely ~ ~ ironic ~ ~ hypocritical ) . 
  / r/portugal is pretty good ( the users are mostly friendly and helpful towards both portuguese and foreigners ) , as long as politics is n't involved , then it 's a battle zone between the left and right and you 'll become obese with the amount of popcorn you 'll eat while reading the comments . 
   and build a wall around russia and make the russians pay for it . 
  [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_barrier ) and [ eesti ^ ^ ^ stronk ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34085926 ) have got you covered , sort of ... ^ ^ ^ russia ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ paying ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ them ... 
  [ it 's a commemorative coin ] ( http://www.coinsweekly.com/en/german-commemorative-coins-with-completely-new-security-technology/4?&amp;id=3410 ) just like the [ belgian 2.5 $ ] ( http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-belgium-2pt5-euro-waterloo-coin800.jpg ),

  when you say it does n't reduce the cost are you referring to the cost for the people or for the government ? 
  do you think it causes more or less of a strain on the economy than the public healthcare that germany has ( for example ) ? 
  for instance the healthcare system in portugal takes a major chunk out of the country 's economy , would the system that switzerland or nl have help reduce the costs for the government and help increase the quality of the healthcare or would it be more expensive ?

   are they associated with your nation in any way , like the british bulldog and the uk . 
  are they common pets , strictly wild or working animals ? 
  the portuguese water dog is the most popular portuguese dog breed ( both [ bo and sunny ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/sunny_and_bo.jpg ) are portuguese water dogs , for example ) but there is n't much of an association between the portuguese and a specific dog breed ( that i know of ) . 
  they are also a not so common breed and [ require quite a bit of grooming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_water_dog#coat_types ) , [ they 're working dogs , they 're very intelligent and can be easily trained to help you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_water_dog#temperament ) . 
  [ they have one on the turkish part of the border and are thinking of building one in the greek border too ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-bulgaria-idukkcn0wr0um ) , they also have a tight border control . 
  but you 're not experiencing the same amount of refugees that the southern balkans are so right now it 's quite manageable on your end . 
  only if bulgaria decides to remove their border ~ ~ fence ~ ~ control with greece , which is unlikely . 
  romania joining wo n't affect much , if you are considering the border with ukraine , poland , hungary and slovakia also border ukraine and they have n't had trouble on their side . 
  edit :[ there is n't a fence on the greek-bulgarian border yet ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-bulgaria-idukkcn0wr0um ) ( only in the turkish-bulgarian border ) but there is quite a bit of border policing . 
   that 's why germany decided to do the worst : have both : public + private ... but only the wealthy are allowed to quit the public ... 
  same here , and the government even dumps money to the private system in detriment to the public one . 
   it is like putting the best of both worlds into a system - that 's why it is deamed superior to most other systems . 
  so why are n't there more countries using this system ? 
  question for the swiss , how good is your healthcare system ? 
  you guys have a system closer to the us one ( privatized ) than the one in other european countries ( public ) , right ? 
  does that mean that people also experience the same problems that occurs in the us ( people not being able to afford healthcare ) ? 
  and if not , do you think your system is better ( less of a strain in the economy and better for the hospitals and people , in general ) than the european system ? 
  it 's just the media over exaggerating things like they always do , just nod and keep walking and do n't make eye contact , they 're like jehovah 's witnesses !, 
   but belgium gives no fucks .

  well he 's not exactly my first choice , but his government ( i assume ) has managed to turn a former soviet state into a relatively successful country , estonia is growing quite a bit economically , technologically and socially . 
  of the ones currently in government , xavier bettel ( luxembourg ) , mark rutte ( netherlands ) , or taavi r\u00f5ivas ( estonia ) , in that order of preference . 
  no way , that did n't end well for us the last time,

  [ be careful with hola ] ( http://lifehacker.com/hola-better-internet-sells-your-bandwidth-turning-its-1707496872 ) :  hola users ca n't opt out of being an exit node in the free version . 
  the problem with being an exit node , of course , is that ** when someone is connected through you and does something illegal ** or against your isp 's terms of service , ** you could be held accountable ** -- and since hola makes no promises to encrypt your traffic , it carries the same risk that using a service like tor does ( even if that risk is slight . ), 
  if you are willing to pay for a vpn then you could check out [ tunnelbear ] ( https://www.tunnelbear.com/ ) ( they have a free version with 500mb/month which you can use to test if you like it ), 
  it 's not blocked everywhere in europe ( it 's not blocked here , for example ) , but maybe op and other people should indeed refrain from posting them in order to be fairer to the ones that ca n't watch . 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  i have no specific opinion over this because i do n't pay much attention to polish affairs/society , but from what i 've seen they look like the texas of europe ( just replace oil with coal ) , very conservative , very religious and a bit backwards , but this is just a stereotype and i refuse to believe that the entire population is like this . 
  ultimately it varies from people to people and you ca n't generalize it and i wo n't generalize it , to me this is the image/stereotype that is transmited to the world because the media prefers to transmit loud idiots over quiet smart people , effectively dumbing down the population ( and this happens everywhere , not just poland ) so it just makes it seem like the entirety of the population is a bunch of idiots , but i know there are smart progressive people in the country and they have my utmost respect . 
  and in the language ( pronunciation ) of my land ( algarvian ) : `` um\u00ea ovacreft t\u00e1ch\u00ead ` anguias '', 
  yeah , but it 's just something that you do n't hear about , i never knew there was an issue , at least with macedonia ( fyrom ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ greeks ) you hear about it because the greeks make their voices heard outside of the area of conflict , with the british isles where is this issue discussed besides ireland and maybe the uk ? 
  just curious , is it something controversial in ireland like macedonia 's name or is it just among a few people ? 
   would you be happy if everybody started describing portugal as being on the spanish peninsula ? 
  i think it 's a bit of a different situation , the iberian peninsula was never called the spanish peninsula so it would n't make sense , it used to be called [ hispania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispania ) by the romans a long time ago , maybe then , when the regions were broken up and [ lusitania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitania ) was formed , some people kept calling the lusitanian people hispanics and it took sometime for people to adapt . 
  i 've never heard of irish people being mad about the name british isles so i assumed it was n't an issue , but if there 's a majority of irish people who defend that the name should change then they should try to make their voices heard , not just locally but globally , otherwise , even if ireland decided to change their name , people from other countries would still keep using british isles because of ignorance to the issue . 
  there 's also cgp grey 's video about the [ differences between the uk , great britain and england ] ( https://youtu.be/rnu8xdbsn10?t=1m10s ) where he also says that the british isles include great britain ireland and the other smaller islands around these two big ones . 
  `` o meu hovercraft est\u00e1 cheio de enguias '' , although there are two portuguese words for hovercraft ( * aerobarco * and * aerodeslizador * ) most people prefer to use the english version, 
  if someone is interested , john oliver did a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ushhoch4q8 ) talking about this issue and how the tobacco industry tried to sue countries that did something like this . 
  hey , merkel finally got her hands unstuck , good for her !, 
   dublin is one of the more expensive cities in the uk this is a joke , right ? 
  that 's why galicia looks like it 's part of portugal in the map, 
  it 's okay , we can just name it [ portugalicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal ) and use [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/flag_of_portugalicia.svg ) , 
  my guess is we have many tiny villages spread out throughout the region which means more roads and more spread out lights , whereas on the spanish side people tend to gather more in urban centers leaving the country side more empty , again , just my guess, 
  that 's because you belong to us , this map just reinforces it , you guys even subconsciously selected the same lighting as us , great minds think alike and all that , 
  and what sickens me the most is the deal that 's being discussed between the eu and this country , i hope that deal gets a clear rejection, 
  disasters , the only thing missing in cities skylines that would make that game much more entertaining , i remember in sc4 you could spam the map with tornadoes or meteors , those were times , 
  so , is it safe to assume that now he 's just going full on dictator mode ? 
  what 's next ? 
  no more elections ?
