  any party other than his is going to be labeled a terrorist group ? 
  anybody that says something against him is arrested or fined ? 
  ( oh wait , that 's already happening ), 
  you can kind of see the border between portugal and spain , we appear to have yellower/dimmer lights, 
  and what does that have to do with anything ? 
  they only hosted the live debate with members of both sides and asked them questions ( mainly from the audience ) , the debate does n't lose any meaning just because of the host and the live debate is unedited, 
  now if the rest of the eu members would do the same , in fact the weapons ban should extend to the entire middle eastern region , but at least this is a start, 
  yeah , the debate was clearly a win for the remain side . 
  the leave side constantly presented predictions that are just as valid as someone predicting they 'll win the lottery , and constantly diverted from answering the questions , and when farage would constantly call clegg out , telling him he was lying , it would just make the case more and more for the remain because they themselves ( leave side ) never presented an actual fact about how leaving the union would be beneficial , they just kept to predictions, 
  just leaving [ this ] ( http://gfycat.com/silkyboringhorsechestnutleafminer ) here in case you have n't seen it yet . 
  also [ the guardian 's debate ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/15/guardian-eu-referendum-debate-with-farage-clegg-alan-johnson-and-leadsom-live ) ( [ video here ] ( https://youtu.be/0u4iecc3xr0?t=21m ) ) from yesterday might help you , i find that nick clegg ( i do n't know him , but apparently he 's quite hated , i do n't know why , if someone wishes to enlighten me on that they are free to do so ) did quite well in presenting his point of view, 
  not to be that guy , but offices have had dress codes long before any of this , in some work-places guys ca n't wear shorts/sandals or are only allowed to wear suits or company uniforms , and i do n't see how this is any different , it just seems to me more like a sensationalist article to rile people up . 
  [ porto university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_porto#rankings ) , [ lisbon university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_lisbon#rankings ) , and [ coimbra university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_coimbra#reputation ), 
  putting the capital aside , it has to be [ madeira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madeira ) . 
  it does n't help that [ their former governor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alberto_jo%c3%a3o_jardim#controversies ) was involved in a few controversies , basically he was a big spender , most of the times at the cost of the continent and the eu . 
  we use * bom apetite * , * bom proveito * and even * bon app\u00e9tit * sometimes, 
  coincidentally , today [ there was a news article ] ( http://observador.pt/2016/03/14/navio-da-armada-vasco-da-gama-descoberto-oma/ ) about oman finding a portuguese ship that sank in 1503 ( 513 years ago ) that possibily belonged to [ vasco da gama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasco_da_gama ) 's fleet, 
  [ yes ] ( http://pre14.deviantart.net/f9e6/th/pre/f/2014/361/6/6/praise_the_sun_by_immp-d8bfvos.jpg ), 
  almost none , referendums are quite rare over here and , of all political parties with seats in the government , only one is full anti-eu ( the communist party ) , also one wants the eu to change ( left block , they do n't like that the eu parliament has a right-wing majority ) , and both do n't have enough seats to do anything about it and it 's not like they are going to gain a majority anytime soon seeing as the people here always like to alternate their votes between the ps and psd . 
  besides , being a land of emigrants means the majority of people are pro-eu because they have at least one family member outside the country , in addition to that some view the eu as a way to help control our corrupt politicians . 
   the dutch parliament has already voted in favour of the treaty and the referendum only has an advisory role . 
  if they already approved then what 's the point in having a referendum ? 
  then it 's just like / u/prussicus said , it 's more prevalent in universities and less in high schools , higher level jobs and ones that involve tourism have a lot of english and lower level ones not so much . 
  yes , more so if you intend on emigrating or working in an industry that deals with foreigners ( tourism for example ) 2 . 
  yes to the both 3 . 
  i do n't understand the school part , do you mean if they teach english ? 
  in that case , yes ( they teach it from 3rd ( if i remember correctly ) to 12th grades and then you may even have english classes in university ) . 
  in jobs it goes back to the industry , if you work in companies that have contact with many foreigners ( tourism and even retail ) then english will be quite prevalent , in others not so much . 
  there are several depending on the regions : the [ porto area ] ( http://ihg.scene7.com/is/image/ihg/intercontinental-porto-4164645857-2x1?wid=1440&amp;fit=fit,1 ) , the [ douro valley ] ( http://www.travel-in-portugal.com/sites/default/files/photos/douro_valley.jpg ) , the [ lisbon area ] ( http://pressroom.visitportugal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lisbon.jpg ) , the [ alentejana coast ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/azenhas_do_mar.jpg ) , the [ azores ] ( https://www.visitportugal.com/sites/www.visitportugal.com/files/slideshow/ht_acores_q40.jpg ) , [ madeira ] ( http://www.dorisol.com/media/grupo-dorisol-gallerybeautiful-madeira-island-scenery.jpg ) , [ alentejo region ] ( http://eng.sograpevinhos.com/app/templates/img/areas/regioes/alentejo/big_alentejo_caracterizacao.jpg ) , [ algarve region ] ( http://www.placestoseeinyourlifetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/caves-in-algarve.jpg ) , [ serra da estrela ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/serra-da-estrela_\\ ( 1 \\ ) . jpg ) , [ sintra ] ( http://qualitycoast.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/picture-sintra_credits_emigus-e1442915302645.jpg ) ( [ extra ] ( https://dwellersthreshold.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/sintra-portugal-nature-images.jpg ) ) , and many more, 
  and portugal, 
  probably tastes better than haggis ^ ^ ^ hehehehehe, 
  you can find some nice areas to live in , and if you like sunny weather you can even go live in the algarve and it 's cheaper than the capital or in porto ( on the plus side there 's a relatively large amount of english speaking expats so you might find yourself a bit at home , on the down side you might not have access to the same amount of services as in the capital ) , the most expensive thing will be the housing but it very rarely goes above 1000 $ / month and the ones that do are luxury dwellings , apart from that , food and everything else is cheap and the people are very friendly towards foreigners . 
  here are a few examples of houses that you can rent in the algarve ( [ house ] ( https://olx.pt/anuncio/arrenda-se-moradia-v4-novo-algarve-olho-idyilbh.html#bdf3c8f0b6 ) and [ apartment ] ( https://olx.pt/anuncio/penthouse-t2-em-vilamoura-idysbwx.html#27fb546927 ) ) , in lisbon ( [ apartment ] ( https://olx.pt/anuncio/t2-mobilado-equipado-c-2-lug-de-gar-urb-colinas-do-cruzeiro-idytq9w.html#7436a6e237 ) ) , and in porto ( [ apartment ] ( https://olx.pt/anuncio/ang10769ba-t3-de-luxo-p-arrendar-em-cedofeita-idytwun.html#36ca16c46c ) ) for less than 1000 $ . 
  and that 's if you are feeling more like spending , you can find pretty decent apartments for about 700 $ / month in the cheaper parts of the cities . 
  you also would n't spend more than 250 $ in utilities ( electricity + gas + telecom ) and 350 $ food ( if it 's only you ) . 
  keep in mind though that , i 'm not entirely sure ( because of the nature of your work ) , but it 's most likely you might end up having to pay a part of you salary for taxes and those 3000 $ might drop to about 2100 $ / month, 
  you can live relatively well with 3000 $ / month in portugal even in the capital, 
  i like it , although i would have preferred if each country sang in their own languages instead of english , it kind of takes away the multiculturalism part of the event, 
  looks like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_keyboard_layout#/media/file:kb_portuguese.svg ),

  during the day : mostly traffic at night : a silent street with only the sounds of crickets and the [ occasional yell of a portuguese mother ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgvbqmgyeyo ) or a random bunch of drunk men passing by, 
  but can they actually do anything with 14 seats ? 
  i get the feeling they would get shut down fairly quickly by the majority if they tried anything . 
  still , it 's a bit concerning that nazi and populist parties are gaining ground across europe, 
  what happened ? 
  but it 's easier to clean and does n't require repainting every few years, 
  it also does n't help that [ it was discovered google gathered some wifi data ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/15/google-admits-storing-private-data )  in a post on its european public policy blog on 27 april , google stated that although it does gather wifi network names ( ssids ) and identifiers ( mac addresses ) for devices like network routers , it does not gather `` payload '' data passed through those wifi networks . 
   but yesterday google blogged that the audit had prompted it to `` re-examine everything we have been collecting '' and admitted its mistake . 
   `` it is now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wifi networks , even though we never used that data in any google products . '',

  here you go , a [ swiss tank ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/adaptive-tank_c_4348497.jpg ) , do n't forget to [ say ] ( http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/5/6/4/frabz-tank-you-very-much-0a6d58.jpg ) ... 
  it started with [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48rrsl/the_hellenic_navy_today/ ) , and , since everyone is a bit nationalistic even when they say they are n't , they started posting the same about their countries , one thing led to another and the posts went from actual navy size posts to parodies, 
  it 's pretty . 
  kinda reminds me of a school ship we have , called [ nrp sagres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nrp_sagres_\\ ( 1937 \\ ) # / media/file : n.r.p. _ sagres , _ navio-escola . _ for % c3 % a7as_armadas_marinha_portuguesa . . jpg ), 
  i do n't know much about foreign politicians , but from what i know i happen to like julia reda , she seems to be in contact with the current world and technology and not stuck in the last decade like many other politicians . 
  that 's a result of the country 's poor economy , unemployment and corruption . 
  people decide to emigrate because , why should you stay in a country that refuses change for the better ? 
  that only pays you enough so that you can survive but not live a comfortable life ? 
  all while you watch corrupt politicians and bankers getting away with clear crimes and still maintaining their wealth . 
  just look at our current economic minister and the fact that the current budget has drawn skepticism both from foreign rating agencies and the eu ( which is very understandable considering they are planing on increasing public spending , reduce cuts and somehow they plan on doing all this while [ keeping the deficit at around 2.6 % ] ( http://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2016-02-05-governo-preve-defice-de-22-este-ano ) ) . 
  there has n't been a competent/non-corrupt government in portugal , if there had been , then it would n't be in the state it is . 
  corruption and incompetence in the government , poor economy , and unemployment rates, 
  [ tap ] ( http://www.airlinereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tap.jpg ) is awful , it should have been already sold or dissolved but the government insists on keeping them , they have sub-average quality with high prices , they cause more debt than profit , it 's just one of those companies that just wo n't to die without taking everyone with them . 
  and [ they 're slogan is a freaking creed song ] ( http://www.flytap.com/mediarep/editors/logos/new/logo_tap_enus.png ) !, 
  well that explains it, 
   yet again a vocal minority is giving the wrong image . 
  that happens , pretty much everywhere , maybe there 's a specific word for it, 
  it seems euractiv just translated the german article , i do n't know if * deutsche wirtschafts nachrichten * is politically biased , but in this case , it could have just been a case of a biased writer , poor writing or mistranslation/misinterpretation, 
  the thing is , both this article and the german one were editorialized off the bat to get a hostile reaction from right-wingers against hollande , funnily enough they included what he actually said so they shot their own foot with this , especially considering that with what he said , the title makes it look like right-winged governments are inherently against the values of the eu . 
   in the headline that means nothing , headlines can be editorialized , which appears that this is the case , nowhere did he specifically said the he was in favor of expelling right-wing governments , not in this article [ nor in the german one this article is sourced from ] ( http://deutsche-wirtschafts-nachrichten.de/2016/02/22/hollande-will-laender-mit-rechtsextremen-regierungen-aus-der-eu-werfen/ ) , except for the title . 
   anyway , these rules are unclear and can be interpreted in whichever way to suit someone 's agenda . 
  the entire rules , or just the [ pluralism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pluralism_\\ ( political_philosophy \\ ) ) part ? 
   `` a country can be suspended from the european union , ''  `` europe has legal tools , through articles in treaties , to prevent a country from violating democratic principles , ''  `` when the freedom of the media is at stake or when constitutions and human rights are endangered , europe can not act just as a safety net . 
  it has to put in place procedures to suspend offending countries . 
  it can go that far , '' where does he say that he is in favor of expelling members with right-wing governments ? 
  it only says that he is in favor of suspending the member states that [ violate the values of the eu ] ( http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/objectives_en.htm#values )  the values of the union  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values , which are set out in article i-2 , are common to the member states . 
  moreover , the societies of the member states are characterised by pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men . 
  these values play an important role , especially in two specific cases . 
  firstly , under the procedure for accession set out in article i-58 , any european state wishing to become a member of the union must respect these values in order to be considered eligible for admission . 
  ** secondly , failure by a member state to respect these values may lead to the suspension of that member state 's rights deriving from membership of the union ( article i-59 ) ** . 
   in comparison with the existing treaties , the constitution has included new values , notably human dignity , equality , the rights of minorities and the characterization of the values upheld by the societies of the member states . 
  congratulations switzerland !, 
   official estimates state there were 1.3 + million migrants from the eu8 nations residing here in the spring of 2014 [ also from 2014 ] ( https://euobserver.com/social/123066 ) [ and from 2015 ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/eu-referendum-how-many-uk-citizens-live-european-union-where-infographic-1526116 ) so these numbers are actually pretty balanced , when you compare immigration from eu countries to the uk and vice versa . 
  [ same happens with portugal , they mostly come from eastern europe ] ( https://www.sol.pt/noticia/121734/furtos-por-carteirista-subiram-40 - ),

  as far as i know , we only have the * sim * in our language , we also use * ya * and * yep * although they 're not part of our language , they 're more like loan words or slangs , and there 's also the variants * afirmativo * ( affirmative ) , * positivo * ( positive ) , and * isso * ( that ) . 
  regarding the no , it 's * n\u00e3o * , and then you have * negativo * ( negative ) , and then there 's * nope * and * nepia * / * neps * which are more like loan words or slang, 
  but what about all the toys that they would buy ?
