  it would bankrupt the uk in a week, 
  i find them quite fitting in [ farms ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.37495,5.402732,3a,75y,267.26h,88.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6-sma_zr4bka4w8pve7uyw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) or [ along the water ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.589701,5.554962,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s117637739!2e1!3e10!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2fproxy%2fuwniyrztktt5_hmud3_q_jok9wdsxfi-0in5jt6ag4waub-pdlzzkxq-mn-felldfa17bwofioalpnr2j0jo3btkrc_gnns%3dw218-h100!7i3607!8i1654?hl=en ) although i can see why people might find them ugly and i bet they 're not exactly quiet . 
  why not plop them in the middle of the markermeer or the ijsselmeer in areas where boat traffic is n't an issue and where they 're easier to be maintained as opposed to the north sea ? 
  we also have chama ( means both flame and 3rd person singular of the verb to call ), 
   you might want to check if the sarcasm detector assigned to you is operational , by the way . 
  it is , i was n't being serious :p, 
  last time i checked muslims did n't eat pork , maybe that 's another reason why they do n't want to come here, 
   promise all refugees they will have paid sports channels for free how to get expelled from your own country in one easy step !, 
  it 's the first in order to achieve the second, 
  our government [ wanted to \\ ( probably still want to \\ ) ] ( http://observador.pt/2015/09/03/refugiados-limpar-florestas-costa-acredita-seria-grande-oportunidade/ ) do something similar with the refugees , in order to [ repopulate abandoned villages ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/pais/braganca-quer-fixar-refugiados-para-repovoar-aldeias_n858551 ) and offer them jobs . 
  although , i feel like having them segregated into communities , could lead to new slums forming ( like [ what happened ] ( http://wikimapia.org/4790490/cova-da-moura ) with some of the african community living here ) , i believe they should have the most interaction with our culture, 
  it feels more like a publicity stunt , truth is they know the refugees would n't choose to go to portugal ( at least the ones that are economic migrants ) and the ones that did would just become cheap labor to be exploited the same way ( or even worse ) than what the portuguese already are , on the plus side though , they get a free apartment so there 's that ( at least up until they start working , afterwards i do n't know if they have to start paying for the apartments ), 
  they need to replace the people that left for a country were they actually get paid enough to live and not just survive , the emigrants are n't coming back so they have to find someone else to do ~ ~ slave ~ ~ cheap labor maybe even some unpaid internships, 
  this is either a publicity stunt ( most likely ) , or a play to get cheap labor, 
  this just proves that eesti should into nordic, 
  lume also means flame in portuguese, 
  you need to take thing less seriously , we portuguese make fun of our country so much that it 's normal for us it 's not really a self-esteem issue , it 's just the way we are , 
  i see what you 're doing there , we 're not rejoining with you guys , one time was enough !, 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ if ^ ^ you ^ ^ want ^ ^ to ^ ^ give ^ ^ us ^ ^ galicia ^ ^ we 'd ^ ^ appreciate ^ ^ it ^ ^ ,

  i 'm a bit of an architecture freak so it would have to be the netherlands , specifically amsterdam because of the amount of [ canals and canal houses ] ( https://www.shortstay-amsterdam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/apartment-13.jpg ) they have there , coming in second would be switzerland for their neatness , scenery and also some pretty houses , specifically the old parts of [ berne ] ( https://media.timeout.com/images/101746923/image.jpg ) and [ zurich ] ( http://automata2016.ini.uzh.ch/automata%202016%20%7c%2022nd%20international%20workshop%20on%20cellular%20automata%20and%20discrete%20complex%20systems_files/swiss-zurich-111.jpg ) . 
  well i 'm [ not the only one ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6125068/britains-surveillance-society-beyond-orwells-worst-fears-warns-michael-mansfield.html ) thinking the uk ( and other countries , before you come with the `` but other do it too '' excuse ) is going over board with the surveillance, 
   i was n't aware there were cameras in people 's homes watching them , ** telling them to exercise ** . 
  no , but the [ uk has lots of cctv cameras ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10172298/one-surveillance-camera-for-every-11-people-in-britain-says-cctv-survey.html ) , and [ gchq has been going a bit crazy ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/01/gchq-accused-of-persistent-illegal-hacking-at-security-tribunal ) when it comes to hacking people , also [ apparently ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/gchq-hacking-does-not-breach-human-rights-investigatory-powers-tribunal ) they are free to do so . 
   just a few hours ago you wanted the uk to leave and now you 've deleted all those comments . 
  i admit i went completely overboard in those comments , i just got tired of all the `` britain wants to leave because of this and because of that '' articles that the media has been putting for years , like i said in one of those comments , eventually it just gets to the point were you just say `` if you want to leave , just leave already and stop bothering me ''  so you 're playing both sides now ? 
  weird you want the uk to exit the eu but mention `` oh you 're going to become 1984 if you do leave '' . 
  i always try to look at things from both sides ( also the reason why i eventually deleted the comments ) , and in this matter i was n't saying that if they left they would become a version of 1984 , i said that in the matter of people 's freedoms the eu had very little power in the uk because they also happen to have an opt-out but the little power they had could at least slow the tories increasing surveillance policies which happen to be similar to 1984 's airstrip one . 
  the fact of the matter is that they already are moving towards it , it 's just the speed at which they do that will change depending on if they stay or leave the eu ( and if they stick with the same government ) . 
  true , what i wanted to convey with my comment is that in regards to freedom ( for people not government ) the eu has little say in what happens in the uk so leaving would matter little in that subject , to say that leaving the eu would mean the uk would be free is only as true as the government that the uk has , it would be free from the eu but it most certainly is not free from the tories, 
  yep , [ the uk has an opt-out in the area of freedom , security and justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#area_of_freedom.2c_security_and_justice_.e2.80.93_denmark.2c_ireland_and_the_united_kingdom ) , so they have a bit of freedom to what they can do in this matter . 
  on this matter , leaving the eu would only mean that the uk government would be even freer to do as they please and institute more laws , start blocking even more websites and increase mass surveillance , for instance . 
  that saying the uk would be free if they left is very naive considering they would also be freer to just go full on surveillance mode and the current government that has been pushing more and more surveillance laws would n't just change their mind after leaving, 
  [ if you consider moving closer and closer towards a 1984 's version of uk free ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_surveillance_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  answer me this , ireland , like the uk , are not members of schengen but you guys have a border deal with each other right ? 
  why would you think that the uk would not rectify their treaties with ireland , you are also a big trading partner with them , also many companies that used the uk to enter the eu could start moving to ireland as consequence of them leaving . 
  how about you let them leave first , wait a few years to see how thing pan out and then decide for yourselves if you should leave or not . 
  i also was expecting something like what happens in the eu parliament but i guess having stuff like this televised would prevent them from making shady one-sided deals, 
  it seems when it comes to the refugee crisis the eu ca n't deal with it , if austria ca n't deal with more refugees then it makes no sense for them to accept more , the same applies to every other country that is currently over capacity , why cripple a country ? 
  there needs to be a limit . 
  and why is austria sticking to the cap going against the eu but britain cutting benefits for eu residents not ? 
  it 's definitely spain , looking [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696 ) , even though the data from 2011 , spain 's economy is intertwined with the portuguese , we tend to help each other when we can and sometimes even act as tight alliance in the eu when it comes to matters regarding the peninsula . 
   and psd is n't social democratic at all . 
  they should update their name . 
  among the 5 big parties only the left bloc and the communist party have names that fit their ideologies : psd should be named conservative party , ps should be the social democratic party , and cds should be the christian conservative party but changing ps 's name to psd 's name could cause confusion among the elderly and could even lead to an absolute majority for ps ( and having the most corrupt party have absolute majority in government is not good ), 
  that [ logo ] ( http://www.versiliatoday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sel-si1.jpg ) reminds me of a [ kinder surprise ] ( http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/british-stock-kinder-surprise-eggs-case-of-48-x-20g-eggs-1736-p.jpg ), 
  all i say is , this will mean the government can blackmail people more easily , and if they manage to get hacked and the information leaks it could destroy a lot of people 's lives, 
  what 's funnier is that they are social democrats yet their party names are called socialists , although i can see how calling our [ socialist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party_\\ ( portugal \\ ) ) social democrat party would become very confusing considering our liberal conservative party is also called [ social democratic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_\\ ( portugal \\ ) ), 
  over here [ some companies ] ( http://www.hipersuper.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/compal-vital1.jpg ) have been replacing sugar with [ stevia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stevia ) to appeal to the weight loss people ( although the flavor has also changed a bit ) also i do n't know if they include the natural fruit sugar in the labels ( i assume they do ) so that might make you perceive as they add lots of sugar when part of it comes from the fruit itself ( apples , for instance , [ can have 25g of sugars ] ( http://www.livestrong.com/article/448646-sugar-content-of-an-apple/ ) in it ), 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheese#/media/file:epidemiological_data_and_cheese_consumption.png ) has more countries ( although the data does n't coincide ), 
  i sense a few serbians will be triggered, 
  it sounds ridiculous but it 's in the article  under the proposed law , foreigners would be automatically deported after completing their sentences , without the right to appeal , both for serious crimes such as murder , rape and armed robbery , ** and for two lesser offences committed within a 10-year span such as speeding ** and breaking-and-entering . 
  it makes sense to deport criminals that commit ** serious ** crimes like murder , but when it comes to less serious crimes this is a bit excessive . 
  speeding ? 
  really ? 
  so if i worked and lived in switzerland for 4 years and i happen to one day miss the speed sign and accidentally go over the limit , does that mean that i 'm automatically deported ? 
  i think in terms of crimes like these it should be a three strikes and you have your driving license revoked not a one strike and you get deported . 
  [ it 's beautiful ] ( http://blog.medspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sound-of-music-allergies-meme-300x250.jpg ),

   us losing the entry region of finnmark to a russian invasion that would give you a reason to invoke article 5 of nato , so there 's no way that would happen, 
  what would happen if one day you guys decided `` you know what , let 's not intercept them , if they get even further inside the territory then we shoot the damn plane down and russia ca n't do shit because it was clearly inside our territory '' ? 
  seeing as psoe will never accept a referendum ( and neither pp ) , the only way i can see the government forming right now is by making a grand coalition with pp and psoe , otherwise , new elections incoming, 
  true , ultimately it 's all specific to the country , its allies and trade partners , if it 's more viable to have a king over a president then the country might prefer to stay a monarchy , it 's also a more stable choice . 
  whether a country has a president or a king , both sides have good and bad perks that depend on the person in power , a good ruler is preferable over a bad president and vice-versa . 
   not a very likable fellow , he 's an activist by trait , wanted to make his university ` free of israel ' , is supporter of palestina , ** hates black pete , hates jews ** , the king , ** the dutch ** , and ** practically everything that 's not him ** . 
  guys like that are the reason anti immigration parties have so many supporters these days . 
  there 's an expression here that he would most certainly hear a lot if he lived in portugal , `` se est\u00e1s mal muda-te '' ( if you do n't like it than move ) . 
  it 's so common here to insult heads of states ( mainly ours ) that if that law existed here , every citizen would have been arrested at least once , in fact that law is completely unenforceable here because even politicians and the police insult heads of states . 
  you got anymore of that cvm ? 
  we 're in need of it, 
  just curious , is [ l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a8se-majest%c3%a9#netherlands ) still enforced in the netherlands or is it just one of those laws that no one cares about ? 
   they hold no power depends on the nation , [ queen elizabeth has the same powers as a president and more ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/weirdest-powers-queen-elizabeth-ii-british-sovereign-prerogative-swans-dolphins-2015-5 )  generate tourism the more well know royal families , yes , but they can also spend a lot of money , in some nations they generate more money than they spend , in others the same might not apply , and [ royals are n't free from being criminals ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35278172 )  help on relations on other nations that also happens to be the job of the president , except a president is elected and can be fired if he does n't do his job , you might end up with an idiot for a monarch and then you end up doing the opposite of improving relations .

  the land west of the urals is , the rest is asian , considering most of the population live on the european part and share a culture closer to the european one , then you can consider them as europeans , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_transcontinental_countries#/media/file:europe_asia_transcontinental.png ) you can see were the country is split between the two continents, 
   when philip ii of portugal ( philip iii of spain ) died , he was succeeded by philip iii ( and iv of spain ) who had a different approach on portuguese issues . 
  taxes raised affected mainly the portuguese merchants ( carmo reis 1987 ) . 
  the portuguese nobility began to lose its importance at the spanish cortes , and government posts in portugal were occupied by spaniards . 
  ** ultimately , philip iii tried to make portugal a royal province , and portuguese nobles lost all of their power ** . 
  they are literally to the east of us ( also north ), 
  why learn the cuisine of those bastards on the east when we have a much better cuisine , 
  which says a lot about the state of politics, 
  [ plus they have the statue ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/darth-vader-statue-erected-ukraine ) [ and a russian city elected a cat as mayor in an unofficial poll ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/barsik-the-cat-voted-more-popular-than-other-mayoral-candidates-in-siberian-city-in-protest-of-a6775741.html ) , the world can be silly at times .

  fine you get one pass i do n't know were you 're buying porto wine but it 's not that expensive ( you can get a 75cl bottle for less than 10 $ ) .

  ^ ^ but , ^ ^ if ^ ^ you ^ ^ exclude ^ ^ madrid , ^ ^ then ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ like ^ ^ the ^ ^ spaniards, 
  frankly , that 's the only spanish dish i know , the fact that it 's catalan just shows how horrible spanish/castillian food is , 
  like we were a colony of spain , a colony that eventually got fed up and threw a box full of paella to the harbor, 
  technically , yes , but [ that 's not what happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_union#decline_of_the_union_and_revolt_of_portugal ) , the portuguese were treated like second class citizens , taxes were raised , we started losing colonies , and old allies became enemies , portugal was effectively a royal province under spanish rule . 
  long story short : our king died with no heirs , they inherited our throne and decided to treat us like second class citizens , tax the hell out of us and treat us like crap , in addition to that they lead us to war against england , which was an old ally , breaking the [ anglo-portuguese treaty of 1373 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_treaty_of_1373 ) ( which returned after we regained independence ), 
  both subs overlap quite a bit when it comes to users and jokes , it 's not uncommon to see their jokes over here , there is also quite a bit of paradox jokes ( mostly eu4 and vicky 2 ) in both subs,
