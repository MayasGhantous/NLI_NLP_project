  [ that 's cute ] ( http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/cm_ao_minuto/detalhe/mau_tempo_sobe_para_dez_o_numero_de_distritos_com_aviso_laranja___ipma.html ) , unfortunately if we go to the beach we risk getting taken by the [ 7-8m waves that can reach 14m ] ( https://www.ipma.pt/en/index.html ), 
  are you sure it 's not that [ tumor in the center of rome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vatican_city ) ? 
  while the portuguese population is n't fond of angola ( and vice-versa ) , i do n't think it 's a tense relationship , both governments make deals among each other ( unfortunately ) , we buy their crude oil and refine it to sell , and the angolan investment comes from a select elite ( which happens to be the family of the members of their ruling party namely isabel dos santos ) . 
  the angolan hatred of the portuguese comes from their party diverting the blame from them to us , similar to what happens in many former colonies . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  yeah those guys are horrible , just look at how many families were destroyed by monopoly , they are the scrounge of the earth !, 
  nowadays i do n't think we have any . 
  historically we 've had periods of war with spain and france , but during other periods we were allies , there really is n't a sense of hostility towards the spanish , it 's more of a brotherly rivalry . 
  due to the extent the empire had there was periods of hostility with many countries and also periods of peace , the recurring rival/enemy was the ottomans but that no longer applies . 
  there is a bit of distrust towards the chinese because they have been purchasing many things in the country and people believe our government is selling the country to them , there is also a bit of hostility towards the eu and germany but that is to be expected , there is also distrust/hostility towards russia and middle eastern countries , but again , that is to be expected . 
  but greenland is denmark , and so are the faroe islands, 
  you 're not the only ones, 
  i though it was iceland you did n't spoke of, 
  - spain , galicia to be more specific , because of proximity , language , culture and history - uk , specifically england , because of the alliance - norway , because cod, 
  is finland the awkward silent adopted brother that is always drunk ? 
   nobody wants the apocalypse . 
  ultimately it all comes down to how crazy the governors of those countries are ( not just the presidents but also all the commanders of the armies and all the other people who rule over the country ) , but yes , if russia used nukes it would pretty much be mutually assured destruction , at least until someone finds a way to shoot down the missiles before it reaches the populated areas , similar to israel 's [ iron dome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_dome ) , in which case the borders would just become a no man 's land completely irradiated and destroyed , not to mention the impact on the enviroment . 
   proof number 99999 that portuguese are spaniards in denial of it . 
  :d nah , everybody knows spaniards are just portuguese with a lisp ;p, 
  why ? 
  what 's wrong with calling it that ? 
  they are a national army that is in charge of protecting civilians are they not ? 
  if anything i 'd say the spanish actually have the best name for it, 
   having a militarized police called guardia civil ( civil guard ) is a very spanish thing not really , they are comparable to our [ national republican guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_republican_guard_\\ ( portugal \\ ) ) , the french [ national gendarmerie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gendarmerie ) , the italian [ carabinieri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carabinieri ) or the dutch [ royal marechaussee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_marechaussee ) and they are all joined by the [ european gendarmerie force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_gendarmerie_force ), 
  norway has quite a bit of taxes , i 'd say switzerland , with their high salaries and low taxes , would be even higher, 
  yes , but floats are supposed to be satirical and make fun of certain situations and are almost never taken seriously . 
  whereas newspapers are a source of information ( although i ca n't talk specifically about that newspaper because i do n't know what they usually post ) so they 're usually taken more seriously , sure they have their satirical columns . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that , yes they are both a satirical exaggeration of events , but the medium in which they are convened are different , therefore making it a bit unbalanced , you expect these things from floats so it 's expected and people do n't make a big fuss about it , but in newspapers you might not get them so it makes it a bit unexpected and can end up surprising people, 
  is n't that just a higher minimum wage ? 
  would n't that cause a rise in prices ? 
  ( something that comes up every time some country wants to increase their minimum wage ), 
  really ? 
  for a float ? 
  they are supposed to be satirical , that one is n't even that bad [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polish-press-nazi-imagery-war-of-words-eu-angela-merkel ) is much worse because it 's an actual newspaper, 
   living wage what 's that , some sort of basic income ? 
  never heard of it before, 
  what i said was just my opinion , no way the government will do anything about the situation , they might comment it but that 's just it  why would portugal introduce such s policy oh my sweet summer child , you have no idea how this country works , if something benefits the ** politicians ** then they will pass it , if it benefits the people then they will `` consider '' it up until election year and then they rush it only to have it removed by the next government . 
  portugal has had a long history of crappy policy making and that is n't going to change anytime soon . 
   if portugal removes that they 'd very much be shooting themselves in the foot . 
  at the start , yes , but we also get lots of german and dutch tourists , in fact the past summer i saw more dutch and german people than british in my city , we could as easily make the same deal with them . 
   a tax cut for pensioners is nowhere near the same as in work benefits for eu migrants of course not , but that does n't mean the uk is in the right about removing benefits for people that actually work and pay taxes . 
  if they want to expel immigrants who do n't work and receive money from the government , then that 's something else which i agree with . 
  but removing benefits that should be available to all working members of the eu residing in the uk , borderlines slave labor and promotes discrimination . 
   what benefits to british retirees get from portugal ? 
  read the link on the comment , mostly tax cuts :  it is possible to move to portugal and pay absolutely no tax whatsoever on your pension , whether you decide to take it as one lump sum or as a regular income . 
   this is because the united kingdom has a double tax treaty with portugal and in 2009 , portugal introduced the nonhabitual residents regime . 
   this allows new arrivals who become tax resident to take all foreign sources of income such as pensions tax free for the first 10 years . 
   jason porter of blevins franks , a company that specialises in financial advice for british expats in europe , says this is available to anyone who has not been a resident for tax purposes for the previous five years . 
   to qualify , you need to register as a non-habitual resident with the portuguese tax authorities , and after 10 years you will be taxed at portugal 's marginal rates, 
  well it would only make sense that if the uk decides to cut benefits for working , taxpaying immigrants , then portugal should cut all benefits the british retirees get when moving here , [ which is quite a few ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/special-reports/11519095/the-ultimate-pension-freedom-retire-in-portugal-and-reduce-your-tax.html ), 
  although pretty much every city here has an ugly area which can make it hard to determine the ugliest one , [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.conexaolusofona.org/conhece-as-10-cidades-mais-bonitas-de-portugal-e-as-10-mais-feias-saiba-quais-sao/ ) with the 10 most ugly and most beautiful ( according to the author ), 
  it 's an [ old comedy sketch show ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_enciclop%c3%a9dia ) from 1997 , created by one of the most famous ( here at least ) portuguese [ comedians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_jos%c3%a9 ) ( although he only has german nationality ), 
  mmmm , [ gouda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ole9mttbjha ), 
  yep , it 's the most annoying accent we have , maybe tying with the accent spoken by the younger generations that envolves mixing portuguese and english words while speaking in order to sound `` hip '', 
  meanwhile , i wonder how many protests and strikes have happened in greece during the same time period, 
  one does n't invalidate the other , there 's also the accent that appears in [ revenge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr55ie7le50 ) , which i think is the one trailbear was referring to, 
  i was basing it on [ this comic ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/language-lesson.jpg ) as a joke, 
  or the [ valley girl accent ] ( https://youtu.be/mibg-w6tnle?t=2m29s ), 
  if you know the language well then you can notice ~ ~ slight ~ ~ [ diferences ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrfsn2cu8e ) , if you place the parisian accent next to the marseille one you can notice a difference, 
   this guy has one of the strongest kakker accents i know that guy sounds more danish than dutch ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ in ^ ^ case ^ ^ someone ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ get ^ ^ it , [ ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ making ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/language-lesson.jpg ), 
  i do n't think we have a posh accent , maybe the lisbon one , but i doubt it is . 
  but if you are talking about snobbish accents then i 'd say the '' [ tia de cascais ] ( https://youtu.be/a6a-xuukncs?t=6m16s ) '' accent which has that nasally pronunciation that also includes lots of hand movements, 
  fair point, 
  yeah , but that 's not exclusive to canada maybe that 's why no one mentions it , because their own country might be doing the same, 
   and putting seal clubbing and quebec in the same boat is n't very pleasant i was just stating the negative things that are usually associated with canada , your country has a good reputation so it 's a bit hard to get lots of negative things , and usually the most spoken bad things about canada are associated with the way they treated their natives , the seal clubbing and the crazy language laws from quebec , so even if they 're not on the same level they manage to get bunched together  you would n't be a fan of that either , i bet , if calling portugal shit was common enough that people believed it even we call our country shit so it 's not like it would be a very big insult or a lie for that matter :p, 
  you 'd think a canadian of all people would know why people joke about quebecois ( their stereotype is that they are rude , do n't like speaking english and want independence from canada ), 
  i 'm talking about words like electricity , for instance , in portuguese , we say eletricidade , yet before the orthographic agreement we wrote it as ele ** c ** tricidade , but virtually nobody in the country pronounces the c , same with arctic ( \u00e1r ** c ** tico before , and \u00e1rtico after ) , these changes make perfect sense , of course there are parts of the agreement that are silly . 
   dumbing down the language to make it easier to learn is n't why not ? 
  people are conveying the same message and it makes it easier for other people to learn , they probably did this because they want french to compete with english as a global language , the current generation might have a problem with the changes but if they start introducing them in schools then in about two or three generations it will be just as normal as the current form of communication . 
  then again i believe changes on this level should only be allowed through referendums , but i doubt it would pass , even for simple changes like replacing the * ph * 's with * f * 's, 
   this is not that , this is a regulatory body arbitrarily changing the spellings for the sake of making it `` easier , '' despite it not being spellings that anyone actually uses . 
  in that case , yes it 's a stupid change, 
  yep, 
  seal clubbing and the oil sands come to mind , oh and quebecois , apart from that yeah they 're pretty awesome, 
  love the country and the people ( if the stereotypes about your friendliness is true ) , the weather not as much although the vancouver area has a more mild weather ( i think ) . 
  ^ now ^ pls ^ send ^ maple ^ syrup, 
  there 's also the famous [ aluminium/aluminum ] ( http://grammarist.com/spelling/aluminium-aluminum/ ) ( even though it 's not exactly the same situation ) , and several others, 
  just people and their inability to change , happened here too . 
  it 's not like language changes over the years or anything / s if the population stops pronouncing letters in words and those letters are not important to the meaning of the word , then those letters are unnecessary . 
  just like it would make sense if an english speaking country decided to turn their * ph * into an * f * , and how the us decided to drop the * u * in colour, 
  you 're forgetting ireland, 
  but english is a global language , it 's the language you resort to when you visit a country whose language you do n't speak , and it 's more widespread than french or even german among the eu . 
  they should , but instead went for an over complicated system ( big surprise coming from the eu / s ) probably because the politicians from x and y countries were too lazy to learn english or outright refused to do so and they wanted a `` multicultural '' parliament , but at least they are employing the translators so there 's that . 
  [ even tusk had the decency to learn english when he was elected ] ( http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-10-06/local-news/european-council-president-designate-donald-tusk-learning-english-in-malta-to-take-office-on-1-dec-6736123196 ) . 
  welcome to the eu parliament , where the epp makes laws filled with loopholes and completely ignore the other parties that point out said loopholes in favor of their ~ ~ bribers ~ ~ lobbyists .

   were there a lot of ( naval ) wars the wars usually had their naval parts , especially considering that england was also involved in some of them  i 've always been under the impression portugal and castille kind of left each other alone it seems like that because the borders changed very little but this is due to the conflicts ending in stalemates of the defending side winning because both sides were able to defend themselves , there were actually [ quite a few conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_portugal#after_the_reconquista_.e2.80.93_conflicts_with_castile ) between the two countries and there 's even currently a '' [ disputed territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) '' ( not really , nobody cares about it we just bring it up as a joke ) so we have this kind or relationship of frenemies or sibling rivalry , we also like making fun of each other, 
  that 's easy , castile/spain, 
  [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/england ) , teachers can be wrong , i 've seen a german teacher saying that zurich was switzerland 's capital even after we 'd told her that it was bern , and she would refuse to accept it .

  damn y ^ o ^ u ^ u ^ u ^ u ^ u, 
   sorry , didnt mean to imply they dont have the azores anymore . 
  i was just kidding  in fact , of the two ( azores and madeira ) , the azores are the well behaved child that does n't cry independence every time the continent does n't give them what they want ( mainly money ) , so they are the ones with the least chances of getting independent . 
   portugal ** had ** all the cool places hold your horses , we still have the azores , although the [ us had a contingency plan for them ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/2010/11/us-plans-azores-1975/ ) during the 1975 revolution which could have lead to their `` independence '' . 
  they get lots of rain and even get the remnants of hurricanes sometimes , all that water + volcanic earth = very fertile land, 
  we finally managed to be in the top 10 of something that is actually good !,
