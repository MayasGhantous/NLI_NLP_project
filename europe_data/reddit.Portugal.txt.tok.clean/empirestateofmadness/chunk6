  it most likely has a bit of saturation ( similar to [ this one ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@37.8538883,-25.7761117,3a,75y,72.08h,69.56t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-y0s2gnfsyby%2fvpy9mwshoei%2faaaaaaaaazc%2fv2yg2vyxwbg!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-y0s2gnfsyby%2fvpy9mwshoei%2faaaaaaaaazc%2fv2yg2vyxwbg%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i10000!8i5000?hl=en ) ) , [ but the island is actually very colorful ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@37.8379066,-25.7867394,3a,90y,5.37h,77.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spo-710-2mmm9ldg4cbzfdg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) , unfortunately the weather can be a bit unpredictable .

  aka lobbying, 
   i as a dane will proudly tell whoever calls this unjust to go and take a dump in the sea please do n't , we get our fish from there :|, 
  i too am offended by you being offended of him being offended of us being offended . 
  in regards to schengen , i do n't think they would be forced to join , they would most likely have the same deal as ireland/uk . 
  on currency , there will be problems , the last referendum the uk said that an independent scotland [ should n't use the british pound ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/15/independent-scotland-not-use-pound-english-welsh-voters ) , but maybe they can reach a temporary deal with the eu similar to what the vatican , andorra , etc. 
  have in that they are not allowed to print money but they can use it . 
  but of course these are all a bunch of scenarios , it does n't mean that it would happen . 
  heck , for all we know scotland could declare independence and then decide to be like norway and switzerland and remain on the outside of the union . 
  welp , in that case if they do declare independence afterwards and decide to join the eu , at least they wo n't have much problems getting in ( if there is n't a country blocking them ) . 
  well , barroso is no longer in office and rajoy 's position in government is still uncertain , and with the uk being in the eu , it could threaten to block scotland from joining as a way to deter secessionists , if it leaves then the blocks could be lifted , the uk would have no power over scotland 's entry , but what i 'm wondering is , if in the case that the uk leaves and scotland declares independence , technically it would be the uk leaving the eu , scotland 's status would still remain within the eu , right ? 
  i wonder , if the uk decides to leave the eu but scotland wants to remain to the point that they vote to leave the uk , is it possible for the uk to leave , leaving scotland in the eu or would scotland be expelled along side the uk and they would have to apply to rejoin the eu ? 
  because , unlike catalonia they probably would n't have a country blocking their entry into the eu , that is , if [ spain stops being a douchebag ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/27/scottish-independence-spain-alex-salmond-eu ) . 
   this is why i would n't mind finland taking up fees for foreign students . 
  only for the noisy ones , right ? 
  it 's not about the gmo part , it 's about the hygiene part, 
  maybe it wo n't end up on [ this list ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=447&amp;galleryid=2622&amp;gpid=1 ) afterwards . 
  one can only hope, 
  i do n't think so , [ marcelo is just as conservative on these matters as cavaco is ] ( http://observador.pt/2016/01/25/ivg-adocao-casais-do-mesmo-sexo-marcelo-ja-disse-pensa/ ) , so the veto might remain . 
   ... now it is seeking to lighten oppressive hygiene regulations , and next it may support a new food act that would ban gmos , and legislate for national food security and food sovereignty . 
  and then polish products will be banned from the rest of the eu for not following the safety regulations . 
  swamp-german best german !, 
  the only advantage i can see is for people that have trouble learning/understanding other languages and having to constantly look at the subtitles , but i completely agree with you that dubbing is very annoying . 
  fortunately we use subtitles instead of dubbing movies , with the only exceptions being kids movies like shrek and stuff like that . 
  the hoverboat fleet is mobilizing !, 
  considering most of the other ones are doing his bidding you would have to remove the whole plant in this case , not just the roots , the best decision would , in fact , be new elections , as long as they are not tempered with . 
  probably , we have been dealing with corruption , incompetence and ignorance for centuries . 
  mass emigration as in they ** could ** leave their country to live somewhere else like what happens with people leaving rural areas in exchange for the cities , leaving moldova with lesser population . 
   now tell us how portugal and monaco are the same . 
    well , both are small countries run by old men and both have an a and an o in their names ... 
  there , is it easier for you to understand now ? 
  also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_romania ) , and did you forget about the whole [ incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_romanian_protests ) that happened a while ago ? 
  very prosperous indeed , do they also kill dares as a past time ? 
   then , by your definition all countries are equally corrupt , because there is no country on this planet which is entirely corruption free . 
  no , if 50 people steal 500 $ each it 's more widespread than if 5 people steal 50.000 $ , both are bad but the second is easier to contain than the first one because it 's only 5 people , so , by my definition , no , not all countries are equally corrupt , the more people you have committing acts of corruption , the more corrupt that country is . 
   ... there 's no way moldova would be worse off from a union with romania . 
  never said it would , in fact it would be much better off because in addition to getting funding from romania , it would also be in the eu , although the integration could lead to lots of emigration into romania and other eu countries . 
   romania would be the loser since it would have to foot the entire bill definitely , you could think of it as romania buying moldova , the same way as a company buying another failing one and taking on their debts and changing their administration , expecting it to provide future profit . 
  well , both are small countries run by old men and both have an * a * and an * o * in their names ... 
  it 's not about the corruption in romania , it 's about the corruption in places of power in the romanian government which could end up governing over a unified moldova . 
  not saying it would n't , also they would be integrating the poorest nation in europe and moldova would get into the eu which could cause mass emigration , if the process were to be rushed . 
  corruption is corruption regardless of the size of the money they take , when i said that if they united with romania they would be getting corrupt romanians it is because in the case of unification it would be very probable that romania would be the controller of the union with moldova , are you telling me that your government is n't corrupt ? 
  it only looks like it from above , it 's one of the cities with the highest crime rates , teenage pregnancies , drug abuse , etc. 
  in the region ( although it has been improving ) , employment is low , and the people are quite conservative and fake . 
  also it 's one of the few cities on the * coast * ( not actually in the coast per say ) that actually does n't have a beach ( either you take an expensive ferry to the islands or travel somewhere else to go to the beach ) . 
  besides just because a place is good for tourists , it does n't mean it 's good for the locals , just look at greece and the maldives . 
  like it 's been said here , seems like a reverse maidan on one side you the corrupt pro-eu on the other you have the corrupt pro-russia , i 'd say just unite with romania , but then you 'd have the corrupt romanians , you guys ca n't catch a break :( also , was the cat in the 8th picture also protesting ?

  here 's [ porto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77b6uh4ch1a ) , and [ lisbon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pljfkzwrhre ) . 
  here 's [ mine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2i3apq0wdq ) ( from 4:00 to 5:00 ) , not much to look at . 
  one thing 's for sure , it would help fight abstention , and the vote counting would be much easier and faster , also the issue of voting manipulation is also present in the regular paper voting so there 's that , as long as it 's well implemented with a solid system with solid encryption and solid user verification then it should be fine . 
  it could also be flour , or sugar, 
  nationalizing failing private banks would transfer the bank 's debts to an already indebted country , the best practice would be to have a professional trustworthy national bank that people can trust their saving to and is well regulated and leave the other banks to be private like they want to be without any government bailouts . 
  eventually the people would start leaving the other banks for the state one and you would get the same result without having the economic-liberals and the eu crying bloody murder ( they did with our telecommunications sector , but considering the monopoly that was in effect where they could increase the price as much as they wanted because the regulator was also theirs , then i 'm thankful for the eu , even though it lead to another monopoly among three companies that dictate the prices amongst themselves so the situation did n't change much ) . 
  a country should have its essencial services nationalized , power , water , banking , etc. 
  because they are vital for the country , but when you have a corrupt government , that hires friends for public positions instead of professionals , you end up in the same situation of instability , so it 's best to have an alternative at least while there is n't a strong anti-corruption mechanism in effect . 
  it can still lead to the asteroid breaking apart , all it takes is for them to hit it in an area that 's already cracked under the surface , the only way would be to have the impact far away and make sure that if it were to break apart then the fragments would n't be in a collision course for earth , maybe have the impact near jupiter so that it can pull and absorb the asteroids . 
  and then you 'd have several smaller radioactive asteroids falling all over the planet , it would be best to have a powerful rocket attached to the asteroid and have it propel enough to divert its course . 
  to my understanding there are two major cities in iceland : [ reykjav\u00edk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reykjav%c3%adk ) ( the capital ) , and [ akureyri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akureyri ) ( nicknamed the capital of northern iceland ), 
  or only bail out the state owned banks ( the private banks want to do their thing without having the state intervene and when they fuck up everything it 's the state that has to help them ) and apply severe punishment to the ones responsible for the mismanagement , therefore discouraging future people from doing the same . 
  i do n't know if these types of opinion posts are allowed ( if they are n't please inform me mods ) , but i wanted to leave this here to show the hypocrisy of some people in regards to free speech and other matters . 
  they 'll just start throwing them into the [ eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eyjafjallaj%c3%b6kull ) ( sorry , i sneezed while typing ) or put them in the same room as bj\u00f6rk for a whole week .

  the azores are no stranger to storms ( mostly tropical storms , but sometimes they do get a weak hurricane ) , most hurricanes that hit the east coast of the us divert towards europe passing through the archipelago ( but by that time they 've been downgraded to a tropical storm ) . 
  what 's most worrying is n't the winds , it 's the waves which can damage a lot , while most villages are on top of cliffs by the sea , [ ponta delgada ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/@37.7422618,-25.6703461,7160m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) ( the main capital of the archipelago ) is lower and could get hit very badly by the storm surges , [ the critical period will be between 8am and 11am ] ( https://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/acores-sem-incidentes-nos-primeiros-efeitos-do-furacao-alex-1720289?page=1#/follow ) ( local time , 9:00 am-12 :00 am gmt , 10:00 am-13 :00 am cet ) . 
  azoreans are used to getting hit by the remains of the hurricanes that hit the east coast of the usa , although when they pass the archipelago they 've already been downgraded to a tropical storm , the coast will be the hardest hit but they are a resilient people ( with an incomprehensible accent that make good cheese  ) , they 'll be fine ( it 'll probably just leave a whole mess to clean after and the casualties will be low ) , i hope .

  you could argue that the netherlands also fit into the `` others '' category , considering their name is pa\u00edses baixos , even though its extremely rare to hear anyone call them by that , instead of holanda .

  in addition to that , there were [ two derrailments ] ( http://www.sapo.pt/noticias/dois-descarrilamentos-a-norte-do-pais-ultimo-_5693762652732b8d786fec50 ) caused by landslides . 
  -- the first happening at about 14:10 on sunday , when a regional passenger train derailed in the conten\u00e7as area , in mangualde , causing three minor injuries , according to the fire department of mangualde . 
  the train made connection between coimbra and guarda . 
  the second one happening at 00:05 , on the douro line , in mosteir\u00f3 , porto , involving a passenger train that was carrying 55 passengers , without injuries . 
  meanwhile due to the weather situation , * infraestruturas de portugal * , decided to suspend train circulation in those two lines during all night , and facilitate the workers jobs of re-railing the trains . 
  the work made during te night , and the subsequent inspections , allowed for the reopening of the beira alta line ( sections between pampilhosa and mangualde ) and the douro line ( between marco and porto ) , according to the * infraestruturas de portugal * communiqu\u00e9 . 
  also in the same communiqu\u00e9 , they also add that during today 's morning ( 11/01 ) the status of the affected lines will be re-evaluated . 
  ** translation : ** -- ** by the end of yesterday afternoon , the civil protection had received 657 occurrences . 
  porto and viseu were the most affected cities . 
  ** the bad weather this weekend gave no respite to firefighters and civil protection . 
  tornadoes , floods , road accidents , and cut roads were some of the hundreds of events recorded in the past two days . 
  in maia , porto , heavy rains caused the flooding of the shopping center * maia jardim * 's parking lot , which ended up being evacuated and closed . 
  according to the comando distrital de opera\u00e7\u00f5es de socorro do porto , bad weather led to the collapse of two of the lanes in a roundabout next to that commercial space and land subsidence on freeway 41 , in maia . 
  affecting vila nova de gaia with greater intensity , the douro river burst its banks in avintes , cresuma and afurada . 
  according to the commander of the civil protection of the city , the river rose its margins in the three parishes 's riverside for 15 hours yesterday and was expected an aggravation of the situation to the early hours . 
  at the end of yesterday afternoon , several teams of civil protection were addressed to the most vulnerable areas to warn the public about the risk of flooding .
