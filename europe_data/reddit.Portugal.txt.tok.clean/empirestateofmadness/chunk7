  amarante was another of the cities that saw the river rise to unusual levels . 
  the river t\u00e2mega reached 6.3 meters and reached the lowest town square , causing losses in catering services . 
  in maya , the rising flow of the rio le\u00e7a turned a residence in \u00c1guas santas , maia , inaccessible , forcing the rescue of a resident in the morning . 
  the bad weather also forced traffic to be cut on the national highway 14 and 104 , passing through the trofa county , district of porto , and traffic was diverted to alternative routes . 
  ** tornado : ** bad weather came in the form of a tornado and hit the lavra parish , in matosinhos , in the early hours of sunday . 
  according to ant\u00f3nio lima , member ( idk the title in english ) of the voluntary fire department of matosinhos-le\u00e7a , the damage occurred mainly on the roofs , windows , gutters and shutters . 
  although about 40 houses have been damaged , all remain habitable . 
  also according to this officer ( again , idk the title ) , the roofing of a restaurant `` flew '' towards a house across the street , went through the window and caused damage in the room . 
  due to the flooding , firefighters had to remove two bedridden people from the residence . 
  the house , home to four people , was temporarily uninhabitable . 
  ** floods and falling trees : ** by the end of yesterday afternoon , the civil defense has identified 657 instances due to rain and strong wind , with porto and viseu standing out as the two most affected districts . 
  of the total incidences , the majority is due to flooding , or 315 cases , and fallen trees with 123 occurrences resulting , for example , in the obstruction of lanes that are `` rapidly freed '' by ground officers , said the deputy operations of the national civil protection authority ( anpc ) marco martins to lusa . 
  there were 47 landslide , 73 relate to the process of clearing debris form the lanes due to wind , and 41 occurrences of collapsed structures . 
  the resolution of the situations recorded due to bad weather involve 1,893 operatives with the support of 747 vehicles . 
  according to him the anpc , among the total incidents , 171 occurred in porto , 103 in viseu and 73 in coimbra . 
  ** alerts : ** the portuguese institute of sea and atmosphere ( ipma ) put six districts in orange alert , the second most serious , due to the bad weather . 
  in a special statement , the ipma had already warned of a bad weather situation that would last at least until this day ( 11/01 ) . 
  the institute has registered high levels of accumulated rainfall in the north and center since the 28th of december , setting that has remained largely unchanged until this weekend . 
  for now , the map of portugal published by ipma does n't get rid of the gray clouds , but the situation seems to improve in the coming days . 
  rain will remain intense in the morning , today , with predictable improvement from the lunch hour . 
  for the whole country , it 's predicted a temperature drop and , therefore , it is expected snowfall on land above 1000 meters . 
  tomorrow , the stage goes back to normal , with the prediction of sky slightly overcast , light showers and infrequent and low wind . 
  ca n't he run as an independent ? 
  while i hope bernie wins , i would n't be surprised if trump won . 
  we 're a little busy with [ our own ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_presidential_election,_2016 ) which is on 24th of january . 
  in that case , yes , sintra is definetly on the top , then you have aveiro ( like venice ) , funchal ( the whole island of madeira actually ) , ponta delgada ( the whole archipelago is worth visiting ) , etc. 
  there 's so many cities with different sceneries that it would have to depend on personal preferences to pick one . 
  sintra is beautiful , and is a * must visit * place , but i feel like it would be a bit boring to live there and you would have to commute to lisbon for a lot of things , also i do n't think there are many jobs outside the tourism area . 
  same thing happens in pretty much any big city here , even in mine which is n't that big , the trick is to not look like a tourist or walk alone . 
  [ porto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porto ) , definitely . 
  it 's pretty much our second capital and people from around the country do n't hate it as much as they do lisbon , besides , it has a nice [ scenery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77b6uh4ch1a ) . 
  [ this site ] ( http://www.gooporto.com/ ) has a nice guide to the city . 
  [ they ] ( http://www.jumbo.pt/frontoffice/contentpages/catalogsearch.aspx?q=azeite ) can go from about [ 2 $ ] ( http://www.jumbo.pt/frontoffice/contentpages/catalogproduct.aspx?id=693969 ) ( depends on where you buy ) , to about [ 7 $ ] ( http://www.jumbo.pt/frontoffice/contentpages/catalogproduct.aspx?id=1124405 ) ( for those limited editions ) , you just need to be careful with the ones that say subtle because those are refined ( watery and not that good ) , besides gallo , [ oliveira da serra ] ( http://www.oliveiradaserra.pt/produtos/familia-oliveira-da-serra.aspx?lang=pt-pt ) also has good olive oil . 
  [ they are mostly ] ( http://www.gallooliveoil.com/int-en/products/olive-oil.aspx ) extra virgin olive oil and differ on intensity and flavor . 
  there is no such this as a good fascist , hitler improved germany 's economy and technology and you do n't see people praising him ( aside from nazis ) do you ? 
  just because salazar did n't kill millions did n't make him any less fascist , he was responsible for [ torturing ] ( http://worldwithouttorture.org/tag/salazar/ ) and [ killing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31427521 ) several people in both the mainland and colonies . 
  and there is a good reason that he did n't parade around , he was paranoid , and there was a good chance that he would get shot like [ d.carlos i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_i_of_portugal ) was . 
  when it comes to modesty , he came from a poor , very religious family , so he might have gotten used to the way of living , he was so conservative that he probably could n't wrap his head around changing even his habits ( reminds me of the [ high sparrow from game of thrones ] ( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/high_sparrow ) and how * modest * he was with torturing and killing whoever did n't believe the same as him ) . 
  and let 's not forget [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_de_oliveira_salazar#/media/file:elementos_da_escola_salazarista.jpg ) , which was required to exist in every school ( oh , and teachers were allowed to beat the living shit out of kids , btw ) , clearly the man was not egocentric . 
  thank god for a dictator that turned the country into something like north korea ? 
  where only national products were allowed to be sold ? 
  where only straight catholic portuguese men had rights , and the rest were akin to slaves and freaks ? 
  were the political opposition was arrested ? 
  were people did n't trust anyone because your own family and friends would inform on you to the secret police for saying anything against the regime ? 
  and i 'm not even going to mention the atrocities made in both the country and colonies . 
  the only reason he did n't get into the war was to protect his own skin , he could n't care less about the portuguese people , he was just as fascist as franco or mussolini . 
  [ our ] ( http://www.gallooliveoil.com/images/img-azeite-darkglass.jpg ) olive oil of course !, 
  well . . spain did try to invade us several times with the wars ending in a draw , the first time they * succeeded * was when the spanish crown [ inherited us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_union ) , and the [ second time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_portugal_\\ ( 1807 \\ ) ) they needed the french and it [ backfired ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) on them . 
  ^ ^ ^ serves ^ ^ ^ them ^ ^ ^ right , ^ ^ ^ hehe, 
  hey , if it works for switzerland and ireland why not for us , 
  yep , we were pretty balanced between the two sides , probably because if we went with one side then we would be invaded by the other . 
  [ we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal_during_world_war_ii ) were more aligned with the axis because of the dictatorship and made deals with both sides , we also lent [ an airbase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) to the us , promised the allies to not join the axis and try to keep spain from joining too . 
  but ... we were in the first one and indirectly in the second one :(, 
  now [ that 's ] ( https://youtu.be/bmz2bpjkxui?t=10m45s ) what i call going out with a bang , holy crap !, 
  i agree with you , madeira prefers quantity over quality and you usually end up with a big clusterfuck , it 's impressive in that it 's a lot and is all over the place ( and is also quite expensive ( over 1 million $ ) ) , but i too prefer the london one [ from this year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmz2bpjkxui ) ( and the other years ) over any that i 've seen from madeira . 
  yep . 
  that 's just sensationalism/stupidity on the news writer 's part , the [ other ] ( http://qz.com/400277/norway-electric-car-incentives-were-so-good-they-had-to-be-stopped/ ) article i found about the possible end of the norwegian/danish tax cut for ev had a `` you wo n't believe this '' kind of vibe so i preferred the cnn one . 
  but for [ how long ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/16/autos/tesla-tax-denmark-norway/ ) ? 
  norway ftw !, 
  ^ ^ ^ rich ^ ^ ^ bastards, 
  seems like it 's every year now and is getting worse . 
  oh come on , it 's your country 's flag , if it were the nazi flag then i would understand but this is the flag that represents you guys outside , the flag that makes it possible for us to distinguish you from the australians  it could also mean that you like the flag 's aesthetics and use it as decoration ( i would n't mind having an estonian flag in my house ) . 
  actually , we 're in [ third place ] ( https://www.euro-millions.com/winners ) for highest number of euromillions winners ( france is in first , followed by spain ) , so we can , indeed , into euromillions . 
  german flair ... 
  joke ... 
  i 'd win the euromillions before that happened , 
  looks like [ this flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_austria#/media/file:flag_of_austria_ ( state \\ ) . svg ) to me , then again i do n't have the csi enhacing technology so i ca n't tell for sure . 
  what 's awkward about it ? 
  do you want to be run by a portuguese ? 
  because that can be arranged , 
  agreed , but even those remaining countries might split due to economic reasons , currently germany , france and benelux 's economies are strangling the other countries , so there should be a temporary split to allow the other countries to catch up . 
  and there should be a strong policy against corruption , mismanagement , ~ ~ bribing ~ ~ lobbying and loopholes in laws . 
   i would like to see them/us become a heavily centralized yet to a large extend locally governed region . 
  so great matters ( military , foreign policy , monetary , market etc. 
  policy by a central government , and all members being autonomous regions regarding internal policy . 
  so , a federation like the us ? 
  i think that is the best way to go without having separatists at every corner , in matters of foreign policies they work as one but internally each state enjoys a certain level of autonomy . 
  if c 's form a coalition with pp , and podemos ( plus their variants , en com\u00fa , podemos-compromis , en marea , etc ) form one with psoe , it will almost be 50/50 so they 'll probably be scrambling to win the smaller parties 's favor , it 's still not very clear who the winner is . 
  honestly , i think that pt would be better managed by be ( left block ) than by the socialist or social democrats ( ps , psd ) ( in terms of corruption not much is heard from their sides , and they were never in power so you ca n't judge the way they govern just by what they say , as opposed to ps/psd who are the only parties that have been in power and have been constantly digging the knife deeper and deeper into our backs and have several corruption scandals on their plates ) , be supports debt restructuring ( which was shunned by a lot of parties ) , and has a pretty competent economist ( mariana mort\u00e1gua ) , even the [ imf admits they where wrong ] ( http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/fmi-assume-que-portugal-devia-ter-reestruturado-a-divida_237705.html ) in how they dealt with the crisis here and that the country should have has the debts restructured , in addition to that they also left their idea of leaving the ez , and they are the sister party of podemos . 
  and as the temperature rises more and more will appear . 
  well then i 'd probably be eaten alive ... great ... freaking mosquitoes . 
  note to self when visiting nl bring lots of repellent and probably wear a beekeeping outfit :p, 
  you know ... when a there 's a storm surge big enough that it passes over the ocean barriers , or when the rivers produce more water than usual , or even if one of the dikes fail , not saying it will happen but it 's always good to prepare for the worst . 
  anyway i already had my answer that you guys take it extremely seriously and invest a lot to prevent it from happening , so even in the eventuality that one of these thing will happen you will already be prepared . 
  besides , there are already places in amsterdam ( and probably all across the country ) that are being developed , like [ ijburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijburg ) , that are already man made islands above sea-level and even have some [ house boats ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.3641645,4.985842,3a,49y,250.66h,87.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sy3aogpoizbxrtq4-duhqng!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
   fun fact : 1.4 million liter of water needs to be pumped out every day to keep it dry if it 's fresh water you guys should start selling it to californians i think they are still in a drought . 
  are the floating houses like house boats ou are they literally floating houses with all the utilities ( power , water , sewage , etc. ), 
  connected to the main grid ? 
   right now , the popular thing is to build neighborhoods where the houses are designed to float in case of a flood ; normally speaking they 're ground level , but when a flood happens the foundation of such a house is capable of making the whole thing float without losing stability . 
  the house is also attached to poles ( which may be built into the structure itself ) , to keep it from floating away on the currents . 
  not gon na lie , that 's pretty cool , 
  you could have just read the last sentence , i doubt the french would call you stinky . 
   it is well known that we want catalonia to secede so that we can annex the rest of the country hehehhehehehe, 
  well , portugal , for one , here we had the entire right saying that if people voted left then we would become the new greece . 
  are there current projects to build houses on stilts or add land to increase the height in case the inevitable flood happens ? 
  also , why is the highway sunken , would it not make much more sense to be elevated ? 
  yes , i 'm annoying and like asking lots of questions . 
  does that mean rt is also banned ? 
  question for the dutchies , do all [ these canals ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@52.1111436,4.8464449,1801m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) have water currents or is it more like a swamp with stopped water , also do you guys get lots of mosquitoes when the temperature rises ? 
  we already have them , across the country , one of the more famous ones is called [ cova da moura ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@38.7443141,-9.214482,3a,75y,226.1h,88.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svt8a560nrjpyjm9gvktccw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) also does anyone know why links to the dailymail are not allowed ?
