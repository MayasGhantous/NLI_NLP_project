  i 'll pretend you did n't say spain ... of course there are shelters but they tend to be crowded or in bad conditions or some people prefer to live on the streets over them , some even refuse to shelter people that are not of their religion , that 's not really the point , in this case they are receiving fully equipped apartments and a salary to get their lives started and the support of the people , which is something a lot of homeless people would love to have but ca n't , and while they could apply to receive money from the government many have just given up on life and are treated like trash by the population effectively demoralizing them even more , and this is just our government 's way of doing propaganda and following the new trend , it 's nothing new , they just want to seem relevant they could n't care less about refugees . 
  and [ people are getting evicted left and right there ] ( http://time.com/4007349/spain-evictions-housing-crisis/ ), 
  makes sense , when our schools were being renovated whe used to have classes in containers like [ these ] ( http://www.algarlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/escola-secundaria-vrsa1.png ) ( [ on the inside ] ( http://c2.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b541358be/14814660_7ctjn.jpeg ) ) , maybe it could be another alternative although they did n't last very long ( they lasted until the end of the renovations but were a bit destroyed ) because students tend to be a bit destructive . 
  no , you misunderstood me , i was refering to this part :  their calls for social reform and their opposition to austerity measures have resonated with the struggling working-class , but the other parties have warned of a syriza style catastrophe . 
  where the other parties are playing the fear mongering card to steal voters from podemos , i completely agree that spain is nothing compared greece , heck they where one of the major contributors to the portuguese bailout . 
   and too big for what ? 
  you think eu countries will turn left because spain turned left ? 
  yes and no , some people are afraid to vote left because they think their country will experience the same greece did , maybe this could help them vote for who they want or it could change nothing . 
  it certainly will change things in the eu commission which currently has a right majority , having a more balanced union would certainly help . 
  well , i ** did ** say i ** did n't know ** :p also you have to agree that even peaceful people start getting angry when the government constantly shuts them down especially when they are a majority , of course this does n't mean they will become terrorists but you could see an increase in violent protests and worse relations between the two sides . 
  -- also feel free to shut me down for what i 'm going to say , but if what joavim stated below is correct :  pro-independence parties got 47 % of the votes then you add what you said :  got a participation of 77,45 % then you could argue that out of 77,45 % of the population , only 47 % voted for an secessionist party , and if you bring in math ( seriously though after this point i have no idea of what i 'm saying or doing , proceed at your own risk ) : if you calculate the inverse proportion to find out how much of a percentage 47 % in 77,45 % equates to in 100 % , then : 47 = x/77 .5 ; x = 47 * 77.45 ; x = 3640.15 y = 3640.15 / n ; considering n as the percentage 100 , n = 100 , then : total of population that voted for a secessionist party = 3640.15 / 100 ; total who voted for secessionist parties = 36.4015 % -- and now i hate you for making me do math ( and possibly wrong math at that ) . 
  they may have gotten a majority in parliament but that does n't mean the majority of the population supports it , of course in politics that means nothing so , again , you made me do math for nothing , i hate you !!!!, 
  wo n't happen , at least for a ** very ** long time , these thing require a lot of bureaucracy and treaties and with the level of incompetence and corruption in pretty much every single country involved we will be speaking ^ \\* insert ^ language ^ of ^ country ^ that ^ ** tries ** ^ to ^ invade ^ us ^ next ^ here \\* before that happens , 
  i would like to see podemos in power , spain is too big and economically significant to consider that the same that happened to greece would happen to them and i believe that a change in politics could help with this fear mongering that has been lingering across the eu about electing leftist parties . 
  also i do n't know how passionate about independence the catalonian are , but the constant shut down of the referendum could lead to a new eta forming , although i think that a referendum of such proportions should have a turnout of at least 90 % in the region ( as opposed the [ ~ 40 % the 2014 one had ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) ) , when scotland voted they did n't go independent ( they almost did ) but at least the people had a say in it , unlike here . 
  ultimately it 's up to our loud stinky hateful spanish neighbors , love you < 3 , 
  those are some [ ugly houses ] ( http://inhabitat.com/ikeas-solar-powered-flat-pack-refugee-shelters-offer-easily-deployable-emergency-housing/ikea-refugee-shelter2/ ) yeesh , why not just plain boards instead of those bulges that make it look like a big porta-potty ? 
  but i guess it 's better than nothing ( just fix the fire issue ) ... 
  here , they have been getting [ apartments to live in ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/pais/penela-vai-acolher-um-grupo-de-refugiados_v855849 ) ( which i find a bit hypocritical towards the homeless population ) , but that 's just because there are a few , as more and more come , it will become harder to host them and these might be the temporary solution ( of course the fire issue has to be resolved first ) . 
  yeah but most countries are capable of producing electricity therefore they are not tied to the global oil market as much as they would having to import gasoline ( not talking about norway in this instance ) , of course it is unfair for the regular market and costs the government more as they sell more but when it reaches a point where both electric and regular cars cost the same , then the governments can make the tax equal for both . 
  without something to make electric cars more affordable and attractive to the population , people will just go for the more convenient/cheaper choice . 
  but as you said , when it reaches a point were the market percentage is capable of being self-sustainable and not immediately regress , then the government has all the rights to bump up the tax and make it fair between both regular and electric . 
  another choice could be introducing taxes to the polluting cars ( some countries have them , i do n't know if dk or no have them , they probably do ), 
  is n't this a bit counterproductive ? 
  was n't norway moving to green energy because they knew their oil would n't last forever ? 
  ( they were investing their oil money on renewables ) electric cars are more expensive than regular ones , this move could force people to go back to the regular ones . 
  georgia 's parliament looks pretty amazing , kind of reminds me of the [ quarian ship ] ( http://i.imgur.com/imtxs.jpg ),

  in certain parts of the city where i live , the tap water has a bit of a strong smell of chlorine and is only good when it 's cold ( it is n't bad for you it just smells , but it can hurt fishes in aquariums ) , it really depends on the city/area you live , but in general if it it 's from the city 's water supply then it has to be safe , wells , on the other hand , you never know because it might be contaminated with pesticides or other things . 
  tl ; dr : tap water -  safe ; well water -  might or might not be safe ;,

  in this particular case it is n't about censorship , it 's about preventing people from distorting facts to push their own agenda , when posting articles the best way is to just keep the article title as is , and post the direct link to the article , not a redirecting link nor changing the title according to your interpretation . 
  you can then express your opinion in the comment section . 
  it helps keep a certain level of quality in the posts, 
  now you 're editorializing the title , nowhere in the article it is stated that it was fn members , just because someone wrote their name it does n't mean it was them , this one might get removed too for that .

  it was most likely a bunch of racist punks , even the local [ fn representative denied involvement ] ( http://www.dn.pt/sociedade/interior/clube-portugues-vandalizado-morte-aos-portugueses-viva-a-fn-4923322.html ) and filed a complaint . 
  just the local racist vandal , every city has them . 
  in the midst of the civil war in europe , scotland will sneak out of the uk while the english are pointing their finger and laughing at france , when they finally discover that scotland sneaked out with wales and norn iron , it will be too late , iceland will have already invaded and annexed them and ireland , your only hope of not being annexed is to get rid of any rotting fish , as long as the icelanders do n't smell rotting fish they wo n't invade you , and so what remains of the uk lives in fear of the mighty icelandic h\u00e1karl , muahahaha !, 
  in this particular case it is n't about fn , it 's about leaked proposals involving the current government . 
  but fn 's involvement could definitely exacerbate the problem .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dt7bx-b1mg ), 
  keep going like this and in a few years the spaniards will have to pay for the air they breathe . 
  i approve  there is just one problem , [ that tiny enclave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trevi%c3%b1o_enclave ) in atlantic france, 
  well , there is always the forests , burning wood might have to do for now , not as effective as coal but beats freezing to death . 
  ca n't argue with that , it 's just that , a lot more people might die because this , they were tired of the corrupt government they wanted it to change , all it did was make it worse . 
  unfortunately , at this point , this is going to cost more lives , ukrainians have a cold winter ahead . 
  like / u/lupinechemist pointed out , the issue is already being [ discussed ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/15/france-spain-energy-idukl5n0z12gw20150615 ) , hopefully it wont take much longer . 
  they do n't have to money to pay , this is what happens when a country relies a lot on another , as soon as they cut ties everything goes to shit . 
  but since the eu is paying part of the money , they could offer to supply them instead , even ration the gas for the winter , this is getting ridiculous on both sides . 
  - ukraine already owed quite a bit before all this happened and the previous governments were extremely careless ; - while i accept russia 's rights to cut the gas to ukraine it will cause a lot of deaths , but then you could argue that the same applies for cutting electricity to crimea ; - the eu is trying to pull a switzerland in remaining neutral and failing miserably , they throw money at the problem when the money does n't even reach the people , it stays with the oligarchs and the corrupt politicians ; - there is little humanitarian aid because everyone is focused on the refugee crisis , and at this point we might be getting refugees from ukraine itself . 
  this is just a big clusterfuck where every side is making things worse and it 's the people themselves that end up paying the price . 
  at this point ukraine ca n't afford anything , they are broke , russia was sustaining them and now that they cut ties they might have to default , a similar situation would happen if belarus decided to leave russia 's sphere of influence , in fact that is one of the main reasons people in the eu do n't want them to join the union , the southern countries already are in trouble and stressing the northern ones and for a giant like ukraine to join it would mean massive economic strain , mass emigration from their side , etc. 
  i completely agree with you . 
  but it is always good to have a plan b , and that is what i 'm talking here , in iberia we get our gas from africa , mainly algeria , and there are already pipelines set , it 's just that we have these things called the pyrenees between france and spain making it difficult to connect both countries . 
  but with a bit of investment we could connect both countries and reduce our reliance on russia bit by bit , add to that the other eu countries that produce gas , our increasing use of renewable energy and biofuel and we could become self-sustaining inside the union in terms of energy , of course it would take time and money , but the right way is n't always the easiest . 
  i know . 
  france was a bit unsure at first because they were afraid that it would mean the other countries would buy less from them and that their nuclear reactors would have to close , but it seems they have put that issue aside, 
  let 's hope it helps , and a power link to the rest of the eu could also help us export some more of our power , helping our economy and the union as a whole . 
   did n't all the other signees violate that agreement too ? 
  pretty much shows the worth of it , they all just wanted ukraine not to have nuclear weapons . 
  * ergo * me saying that neither the us nor russia are saints in this matter , but russia is the only one to have annexed parts of ukraine , and regarding the * west * trying to change the ukr govmnent to a pro west one , you could argue russia did the same . 
   if you think that . 
  the baltics are not comparable to crimea . 
  why not ? 
  is n't there a russian minority in those countries ? 
  were n't they also part of the russian empire/republic/whatever ? 
  is n't that what you said about crimea ? 
  that they were russian ? 
  what makes them different ? 
  the fact that they have no strategic influence ? 
  they could be used to connect kaliningrad to the rest of the country , that could be their excuse to annex the baltics under the pretext of defending the russian minority in said countries . 
  there is always the alternative , find another source of gas , our main supplier here is algeria , i know the uk produces some , is n't there a way to reduce our dependence on russian gas ? 
  i know it would take some time to re-organize a build new pipelines , but at least we should look at alternatives to supply both us and our neighbours and reduce our reliance on russia ( with gas ) , and saudi arabia ( with oil ) . 
  crimea was russian , became ukranian , and was invaded by russia under the pretext that it was russian , violating the [ budapest memorandum on security assurances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  the only reason stopping russia from doing the same on the baltics is that they are part of nato , otherwise they would be the next ( or the first ones ) to go . 
  ukraine is n't a saint ( far from it ) but neither is russia , or the us . 
  ca n't they just get the gas from another country and the coal from poland ? 
  [ relevant ] ( https://youtu.be/zuzd9kyidrm?t=3m55s ) ( not really ), 
  well , the other one i [ found ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nekvode.png ) is n't any better , placing l/tda between be and pcp when it is much closer to the center , and placing the dictatorial parties in the center . 
  also the coaliton caused psd to veer to the right and cds to go slighty towards the center but they are in fact right-winged parties , and ps swings whichever way gives them more votes and since they have been trying to steal votes from the coalition they became slightly more right wing , but with the recent events they will go more left-leaning again . 
  `` radicals '' [ the left block ( be ) is in the middle of the left-center spectrum and even the communist party is n't extreme left . 
  ] ( https://aventadores.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/l9pvgo.jpg ) extreme would be the socialists dealing with pctp/mrpp ( known for [ this ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/baqqdffpark/hqdefault.jpg ) ( it reads `` death to traitors '' ) ) or the psd/cds coalition making a deal with [ pnr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_renovator_party#controversy ) ( the portuguese nazi party ( how they are allowed to exist when fascist parties are banned is beyond my comprehention ) ) , funnily enough these two parties that are on each end of the spectrum have more in common with each other than some of the leftist parties . 
  i 've seen a lot worse in this sub , are you sure it was this specific comment that lead to the ban ? 
  if the party members voted for him why is it that the party is losing supporters left and right ? 
  or is this another case of the media blowing things out of proportion . 
  who exatly voted for corbyn ? 
  it seems everyone including the labour mps hate him except for the conservatives who are probably loving that he pretty much destroyed labour 's poll numbers giving them a clear win .
