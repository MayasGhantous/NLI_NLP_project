  i hope they win , but i doubt it . 
  either way this would piss off more countries . 
  seems to work for the un , just say that you are very displeased with his actions , that 'll show him . 
  seriously the guy is a drunk clown like a lot of the politicians both in the eu and in the member states , but he does n't have much in terms of powers , all it takes is for germany , uk and france to say no to whatever he tries to pass that it fails automatically , add to that the eastern countries that do n't want anything to do with russia , and what he says means nothing . 
  was he drunk ? 
  he was probably drunk ... 
  ** -- warning rant incoming ! -- ** not regarding the war itself but the refugee part , i believe there should be a more strict approach : - if they do n't have a passport from a valid nation ( nation in conflict like syria ) or any identification then they should n't be allowed to enter as a refugee . 
  - if they are a known criminal or commit a crime while in the guest country then the refugee status should be removed and they should be sent home . 
  - they should follow the guest country 's rules and laws , if they have a problem with it they are free to stay in their own country , we should n't change our laws and way of life because of them . 
  - having refugee camps causes more problems because , essentially they are slums , instead the refugees should be spread out along the country ( one thousand refugee families across one thousand cities causes less problems than one thousand refugee in one camp in a city ) . 
  - also insert them in a regular community so they can be introduced to our culture , people have a pack mentality and a need to fit in , so if there is one syrian family among a neighborhood composed mostly of the native population ( or culturally mixed ) then they will try to fit in , this ca n't happen if they are in a group composed of the same culture because they already are a part of that group . 
  think of it this way , when you learn a language in school it 's hard and you probably will forget it afterwards , but if you move to a country that speaks that language , the daily interaction with it will make you learn and actually understand it better than you would in school . 
  regarding the military conflict : - stop giving money to the gulf states !, 
  - stop selling weapons to that area !, 
  - stop supporting rebels that turn on you once they are done fighting !, 
  - tell turkey to stop being such an enabler !, 
  ( they support isis indirectly because they are fighting the kurds and once in a while they attack isis to keep the cover ) - apart from that , we are at an impasse , if we support assad we are supporting a dictatorship and one of the main reasons why there are refugees in the first place , in addition to that russia is protecting assad so there is a tough chance that he will be removed from power and even if he is what 's stopping another from taking his place ? 
  - unfortunately , and i hate that i 'm saying this , but a colonial government could , maybe , bring some stability , at least one that attempts to stop this rotten vicious cycle of war and power vacuums that lead to more war and instability . 
  it 's called desenrascan\u00e7o , or a vertical variant of the flag . 
  has he ever stopped being one ? 
  if they increase their support to the kurds it will backfire because of their situation in turkey , there are already conflicts and separatism in the region and do n't forget that turkey is a nato member , the kurds would fight isis and then turn around and use the weapons that they received to attack turkey which could cause turkey to call nato and then you would be in the same situation that you are now . 
  i feel like the uk is the cartman of the eu . 
  when the their government does something good : we are fine on our own , we are the best , the eu is robbing us blind we should leave , they suck !, 
  when they do something bad : you did this eu !,

  let me put it this way , we have businesses here that complain about the lack of workers in the it sector but refuse to increase wages , now why would an it worker stay in a country that treats them like slave labor when they can go to the netherlands and get paid 5 times or more than they would receive here , and send the leftover money ( which can be more that they would receive here ) to their family . 
  companies that only care about profits wo n't go very far , that 's why google , microsoft , etc. 
  are so profitable , people want to work for them because they are treated like people not slaves , so they end up working harder and being more productive all while being paid more than enough to sustain themselves , effectively reversing the cycle . 
  of course this can also have negative impacts , like what is happening in san francisco where things are becoming more and more expensive , and people that work on other fields like supermarkets , can not afford to live in the city anymore . 
  it 's not that they do n't want to pay the debts , it 's that they do n't want to destroy the country in the process . 
  for instance an increase in salary to a point were people are n't searching their couch pillows for change to eat , would mean that they could buy more , people buy more , businesses make more , businesses make more , they pay more taxes , more taxes means they will be able to pay the loans faster . 
  also having businesses owned by the government ( like the power company , for example ) means another source of income for the government , all this as long as it 's well managed which it is extremely unlikely . 
  they want to swim against the current to end this endless loop of more taxes and lower salaries . 
  this referring to the eastern block ( be ) , the pcp has a more extremist approach regarding some matters that make them relatively dangerous to have in power . 
  the only way to prevent this is to have a deal between paf ( right ) and ps ( center-left ) , but both parties are very power hungry and it is unlikely to happen . 
  pcp is quite insane . 
  i 'm wondering how they ( being friends of dictatorial governments like the angolan one ) will get along with be ( which likes to bash said dictatorial states ) , probably there will be a situation were ps will have to choose between the two , at least all three hate the right more than themselves which is why they are doing this in the first place , so even if they lose one they might be able to run the country with more stability than the right . 
  i 'm pretty sure there was an increase in tax declaration ( people that call those tv shows to win stuff , and people that play games like euromillions were probably the ones that most likely started declaring ) , whether it was a very big increase or not that i do n't know , and yes audi most definitely won big money with this . 
  true , there needs to be a change in the constitution preventing any politician from practicing if they were involved in any corruption case be it small or big , and heavy punishments for the ones that do . 
  at least this way they would think twice before doing anything . 
  and plug all loopholes that currently exists , it 's bad when a government is forced to offer cars so that it 's citizens keep declaring their taxes . 
  she ca n't do much , at least the left/greens usually share her views which helps a bit . 
  `` we '' voted for a member of the [ epp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party_group ) / [ ecr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_conservatives_and_reformists ) , both conservative parties that care more about the corporations than the people , and that accept lobbies from everyone that has more money than you . 
  except the socialist party is the most corrupt of the ones in the parliament , so what might happen is the same that occurred when jos\u00e9 socrates was in power , massive money laundering , public contracts to friends that take a large bonus for themselves making said contracts more expensive than they should be ( [ and some do n't even get finished ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.sol.pt/noticia/121500/tgv-n%25c3%25a3o-foi-feito-mas-custou-153-milh%25c3%25b5es-de-euros&amp;prev=search ) ) , etc. 
  at least now they would have to be more careful because if they lose the support of the other 2 parties they lose the majority .

  \\* boom *, 
  imo , because most eu countries still put themselves above the other members and most politicians of said countries are too power hungry to give more powers to the eu throwing fear-mongering campaigns about how the eu has only caused problem when it 's the commission ( the leaders of the countries ) that changes the laws that are passed , the eu parliament has very little power . 
  for instance , to my view , it was germany that invited the refugees leading to problems in other countries , but they blame the eu instead of germany , germany acted pretty much alone on something that affected the whole union . 
  also a lot of them threaten to immediately jump boat every time a problem appears . 
  with this lack of unification where it 's needed the union ends up being just a loose treaty between countries where [ each country has a lot of asterisks that exempt them of something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) . 
  but this is just me ranting , so do n't pay very much attention , 
  what 's wrong with encouraging more people to vote ? 
  [ google did the same .

  [ it has a very colorful flag and everything ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_autonomous_oblast ), 
  be was euroskeptic , but they dropped it a while ago . 
  now they defend the possibility of a referendum on the issue . 
  although they are n't very fond of the $ because it 's not a national currency so they ca n't inflate/deflate the currency according to the economy . 
  i would be down for an iberian federation , provided all regions ( or states in this case ) were treated equally and their cultures and languages respected , we have a close enough culture to make it happen and turning catalonia ( for example ) into a state would give them more autonomy and the possibility to make their own laws ( which would calm some separatists down ) , similar to how the us works , imo it would make both sides stronger .

  [ well , we had our own version of jack the ripper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon_ripper ),

  canada , netherlands or norway, 
  algarve 's economy is largely based on tourism and having people constantly saying `` do n't go there because everyone goes there '' ends up hurting the region 's economy , also this article appears to completely ignore the eastern part of the region which is less crowded and cheaper then the west , if you want to relax go to the east or the countryside , if you want to party then the west is for you . 
  it 's basically a political system that ensures the same groups stay in power , and nothing changes , one term is the socialist party the next is the social democrats , rinse and repeat . 
  it becomes a two party system like the united states . 
  [ unfortunately we do n't have a party , we have a movement that requires signatures to actually be able to form a party . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirate_party_of_portugal ), 
  do the icelandic people treat political parties as football clubs where they keep voting for the same party regardless of what they believe ? 
  because that is one of the main issues here , people vote for the same parties because it 's the party that they always voted for , it 's the one their friends and family vote . 
  if the socialist party decided to become extremely conservative there would still be people voting for it , and then there are people who only think there are only two parties ( ps/psd ) and keep switching between them . 
  also the icelandic society ( and nordic ) is much more progressive in a lot of situations , you are not afraid of changing and evolving , that does n't happen here . 
  unfortunately there are so many tiny parties that if they manage to actually form a party there is very little chances of it getting any representation especially with the current voting mechanism we have ( d'hondt , which favours big parties ) . 
  i want a pirate party here , where 's my pirate party ? 
  how hard is it to move to iceland ? 
  just wondering ... for a friend ... , 
  do n't worry , we 'll elect a new president next year , this one has gone a little bit demented . 
  and it is very likely that there will be new parliamentary elections . 
  basically , new elections next year . 
  probably what has already happened , a frozen conflict . 
  but since transnistria has a considerable military power compared to moldova and the `` support '' of russia , moldova would be safer reunifying ( especially considering romania is in nato ) but transnistria is pretty much gone , just like abkhazia and south ossetia , if they try to take it back what happened in ukraine will happen there .
