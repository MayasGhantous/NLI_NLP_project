  then our public debt which has been on the rise for the last decade , including under austerity measures will balloon up again relatively to our gdp and we will have to go through more cuts and selling more lucrative companies to the private sector . 
  my decision ended up being decided not by the austerity/anti-austerity farce which we can not democratically control as we have seen in greece , but on the lines of agreement or disagreement with the overall economic system of capitalism . 
  the situation is such that we will suffer either way , and neither austerity or anti-austerity policies are likely to fix anything . 
  in the end we are at the mercy of international economic policies : if they succeed we succeed , if they fail we also fail . 
  bloco de esquerda took a heavy hit when they were perceived as having allied themselves to the right in order to take down minority government of ex-prime-minsiter jose socrates ( partido socialista ) . 
  the right subsequently won an absolute majority with over 50 % of the vote , which i think was the first time it ever happened ( do n't quote me on it ) . 
  disappointed electors either voted on the right , turned to minority parties or went to the communists ( which curiously also voted for taking down socrates , but they have always been against alliances with ps , where bloco de esquerda electorate is more likely to look favourably upon a bloco-ps coallition ) . 
  they are predicted to recover somewhat after catarina martins lead a campaign that has been lauded as very successful . 
  for reference psd is roughly the equivalent of the spanish pp . 
   a right-wing party in the economic sense , but very socially liberal and thus considered `` left '' in the social agenda ? 
  neither one nor the other . 
  they opposed gay marriage in 2010 . 
  the names of the parties are a product of the reality under which they were formed after the revolution back in april 74 . 
  the political climate was very heated and left-wing groups had great mobilization of people and thus all parties tried to sound as left-wing as possible . 
  things have gradually shuffled to the right since then . 
  today even partido socialista is at best centre-left , and has frequently imposed right wing economics when in government . 
   personal attacks is for the weak and then  silly third wave feminists you should work on your self esteem , nobody should consider herself/himself weak . 
  i guess if you call merciless exploitation of a bad situation a good thing for the migrants there are two winners in the equation ... 
  given the variety of peoples that have lived in france the idea the author seems to be going for is that this idea of `` white race '' is ridiculous if i had to guess , thus the painting of the grey skin white . 
  i do n't really know the context behind the drawing though . 
  it 's usually the colour you end up with when you mix a lot of other colours possibly ? 
  edit : i mean in terms of ink , not colour of skin . 
  that 's as absurd as closing our borders to israelis because european muslims will quite possibly get a settlement built on their backyard in paris . 
  the circumstances of the conflict in israel do not translate well to the situation in europe . 
  and most of the refugees are not from palestine . 
  and also likely to have a bias against muslims , given the situation in israel , which is the point i think is fair to make . 
  it 's like a palestinian warning europe against accepting any israelis . 
  to be fair his post implied he knew better than most europeans due to being from israel . 
  we are having a election this rainy sunday to elect the new assembly of the republic . 
  the leader of the party with the most seats is expected to be called by the president of the republic to form the new constitutional government and act as prime minister for the duration of the legislature if he can command a majority in the assembly . 
  there are 19 parties running for 230 seats . 
  116 seats are required for a majority , 154 for a constitutional majority ( with powers to change the constitution ) . 
  the election follows the hondt method for seat distribution , with each constituency returning a number of members of parliament roughly proportional to its population . 
  #parties running for election * ** paf ( portugal \u00e0 frente / * portugal ahead * ) : ** a newly formed coallition between the social democratic party ( psd ) and the social and democratic center ( cds ) party . 
  they have lead the country through a bailout programme that finished last year and are considered to be on the centre-right of the political spectrum . 
  expected to come out ahead but are still on the verge of absolute majority . 
  led by current prime-minister ** pedro passos coelho ** . 
  * ** ps ( partido socialista / * socialist party ) ** : a centre-left party which usually alternates in power with psd/cds ( the parties of paf ) , though they have been known to form coallitions with cds when needed to form an absolute majority . 
  they are by and large a social democratic party . 
  they started out as a marxist party but the most far-left elements have been weeded out and they now advocate an economy of market and integration with the rest of the european union . 
  they signed for the third bailout which was requested while the party was in power . 
  expected to come in second . 
  lead by former lisbon mayor ** antonio costa ** .

  they are euro ceptic , want to leave the euro in favour of the escudo and are against austerity policies . 
  their social policies are somewhat controversial in the left , with the party only recently supporting gay marriage . 
  the two parties are seperated but their long lasting alliance has given rise to jokes that the green party is like a watermelon : green on the outside and red on the inside . 
  lead by former metallurgic worker ** jer\u00f3nimo de sousa ** . 
  * ** be ( bloco de esquerda / * left bloc * ) ** : a former coallition of various left and far-left parties that have now fully coallesced into a single party . 
  pro-european union and pro-euro but anti-austerity and strongly opposed to the current european leadership . 
  socially progressive and mildly anti-capitalist they do n't strongly emphasize a radical change in economic structures , preferring to focus on social issues such as inequality and poverty . 
  expected to contest third place with cdu . 
  lead by former actress ** catarina martins ** who acts as speaker for the national table of the party , which represents its multi-party formation . 
  * ** l/tda ( livre/tempo de avan\u00e7ar / * free/time to advance * ) ** : newly formed left-wing party lead by former european parliament mp ** rui tavares ** .

  also held open primaries . 
  their economic policy is somewhat unclear , with the party focusing on the fight against corruption and the reformation of the political system . 
  their leader has been known to state that he is left-wing but also that he would form a government coallition `` even with the devil himself '' , not ruling out being a junior member of a paf government . 
  * ** pan ( pessoas-animais-natureza / * people-animals-nature ) ** : ecologist centre-left party . 
  strongly pro-environment , this forms the core of their policy , they also have social concerns and propose policies to tackle on poverty and exploitation .

  * ** mpt ( movimento partido da terra / * movement for a party of the land * ) ** : centre party , defends environmental and social policies but also economic freedom . 
  was the surprise of the last european elections taking 7.2 % of the vote and returning 2 european mps . 
  their popularity has largely been attributed to the fact the immensely popular ** marinho pinto ** , who has since abandoned his role as eu mp and formed a new party , ** pdr ** . 
  they are not expected to elect any member of parliament . 
  * ** pnr ( partido nacional renovador / * national renovation party * ) ** : * third position * nationalistic party .

  portuguese article here - http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/-ferro-rodrigues-eleito-presidente-da-assembleia-da-republica-1712144 eduardo ferro rodrigues , until recently leader of the parliamentary group of the socialist party , was elected this friday for the role of presidente of the assembly of the republic , with the support of 120 of the 230 mps . 
  the socialist garnered the votes of ps , pcp ( communist party ) , be ( left bloc , think die linke or syriza ) and the greens , who had supported him before the secret ballot was cast . 
  the socialist defeated fernando negr\u00e3o , proposed by the parties of the right-wing coallition that won the october election . 
  together the mps of ps , be and pcp sum 122 mps , while psd and cds have 107 . 
  the 230th deputy belongs to pan and he chose not to reveal who he voted for . 
  the vote was made in a closed poll , with mps being called one by one to deposit their vote . 
  the president of the assembly of the republic has to be elected by absolute majority ( 116 votes or more ) . 
  the ps group was the only one to do a standing ovation as the result was announced . 
  pcp , the greens and be also apllauded , but remained seated . 
  in his inauguration speech ferro rodrigues left criticisms for the right-wing coallition and also the president of the republic , without ever mentioning either of them by name . 
  he demanded respect for the role of the assembly of the republic . 
  i made this short summary of the main points of the agreement for someone in / r/socialism and thought you guys could maybe find it useful or interesting . 
  these are the terms the socialist party agrees to in order to garner the support of the left bloc ( a anti-austerity group of left-wing tendencies ranging from trotskyism to old fashioned social-democracy ) : * a working group on debt sustainability will be formed , which will be attended by the future finmin who will bring the conclusions of the discussion to the assembly of the republic . 
  * ** the socialists shall desist from their proposal of facilitating collective firings . 
  ** * the socialists shall desist from lowering the contributions of companies and corporations to the social security , which is the organism responsible for funding the pensions/unemployment subsidies and other social subsidies . 
  * ** the socialists shall not cut the value of pensions , and shall unfreeze all pensions and raise the value of the lowest pensions . 
  ** * all initiatives to diversify social security funding will first be agreed upon by the social concertation , which is a meeting between unions , employees and the government . 
  * the worker contribution to the social security will be lowered to 4 % . 
  * ** there will be an annual raise of the minimum wage , which shall reach the nominal value of 600 $ by the end of the legislature . 
  ** * ** the powers of the authority for workplace and employment conditions shall be reinforced ** . 
  it shall be granted extensive powers to ** fight against illegal precarious working contracts and false independent workers ** ( those who actually work as a dependent worker but have no access to the rights that condition grants them ) .
