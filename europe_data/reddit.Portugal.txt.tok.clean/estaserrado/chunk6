  if you want a referendum in your country and you are n't given one , blame your government . 
  depending on your point of view , lots of people admire those guys . 
  it 's not really uncommon to lose elections and eventually win one . 
  tsipras for one lost like what , 4 ? 
  some reparations have been paid . 
  a large portion of the debt remains unpaid . 
  if the greeks told you that discussing debt that they incurred a long time ago deeply offended them you would be foaming at the mouth . 
  germany has no morality high ground , they need to stop pretending they do . 
  churchill would be a failed politician by that criteria . 
  what does that have to do with anything we were talking about ? 
   blaming the currents german citizen for something the nazis did is pathetic and desperate . 
  i did n't , please go plant your strawman somewhere else . 
   you 're vile for your suggestions . 
  yes , historical accurateness is vile . 
  losing an election is n't a condemnation to be a failed politician . 
  unfettered bigotry . 
  many central countries of europe ask the same thing of us , but replace turk with spanish and greek with portuguese . 
  after the ridicule of your argument was exposed its kinda sad to see you spin the argument around like this , kinda pathetic to be perfectly honest . 
  first we never occupied or colonized spain . 
  the people from spain we killed have little in common with the people from the colonies we enslaved , slaughtered and oppressed for centuries . 
  if a spanish leader is in a visit of state to an african country who was a victim of our vile acts of colonization of course they would be expected to pay their respects to the dead . 
  nobody would bat an eye at that . 
  furthermore the situation is not comparable because greece also has been a victim of occupation and slaughtering of ( one of the fiercest ) resistances against fascism . 
  that a greek prime-minister pays a respect to the people the nazi invasion of russia killed is very natural and a show of respect for the country you are visiting and for its history and population . 
   then again , maybe nobody in portugal is ashamed of their genocidal past . 
  i guess that would make them different than the germans . 
  the fact that we are ashamed is precisely why we would not childishly lash out against a leader of an oppressed visiting the graves of our victims after his inauguration . 
  to me the german government reaction shows me that maybe they are n't as ashamed as they pretend to be . 
  the matter of war reparations was already scheduled to be discussed in parliament . 
  also demanding for debts to be paid is not extortion . 
  by the same logic germany is extorting greece for money . 
  the issue still needs to be fixed some time in the future if not now . 
  an outstanding debt of that size does not go away , unless germany plans to default on it ? 
  the trust argument is so profoundly childish that it is basically only ever evoked for the purposes of media consumption . 
  governments never trust each other in matters of state . 
  speaking of ultimatums , how 's the pink map ultimatum regarded in current day uk , if regarded at all ? 
   it just feels really below the belt to do something like this . 
  visiting the graves of the victims of an occupation to your country after your inauguration as prime minister is ridiculous ? 
  what ? 
   it just feels really below the belt to do something like this . 
  visiting the graves of the victims of an occupation to your country after your inauguration as prime minister is below the belt ? 
  what ? 
  that 's absolutely ridiculous . 
  who the fuck would be `` humiliated '' if a leader of an african country visits the graves of the people the portuguese state murdered in africa ? 
  ca n't you see how ridiculous that sounds ? 
  i can see a couple of far right parties and three or four old saudosistas getting angry and rambling incoherently about it for a day or two . 
  paying respect to the victims of a fascist oppressor is not using them as a political tool . 
  stop trying to twist the facts to fit into what you want them to be . 
   no , you can have an elected prime minister appoint someone to push through a reform . 
  this is completely beside the point : you claimed the greeks could not be trusted because they had voted no to the proposals last week . 
  so i ask you again : how do you overcome this fear of the people in any fashion but dictatorship ? 
   and why would anyone trust syriza or a new government later ? 
  governments do n't trust other governments . 
  you do n't trust syriza with the money , you do what you already did for all other bailouts : you portion the money out and only give out portions at fixed intervals if the plan is being put in motion correctly . 
   secondly the citizens voted against syriza 's offer basically the only alternative if you do n't want to deal with the perils of democracy is dictatorship . 
  though what i personally believe is that tsipras should be impeached ( or the greek equivalent ) for disobeying the people 's mandate . 
   the way i see it , the coalition in favour of grexit figured out that the only way to save ez after grexit would be if greece walked away voluntarily , and they are trying to force just that . 
  they are trying to ** force ** greece out of the euro ** voluntarily ** ? 
  fuck those guys are more irrational than i thought . 
   yes , referendum is a backstab , when you do not tell about it to your negotiation partners beforehand . 
  you said it in all caps * and * in bold ? 
  fuck i 'm convinced now . 
   you seem to like word `` democracy '' , so let 's organize referendum in finland , germany and 16 other eurocountries to see whether we want to give any loans to greece ? 
  by all means do . 
  and stop trying to take over sovereignty over another country while you are at it . 
  ask your people that : do you believe greece should become a ward of the eurozone . 
   greece 's economy was improving towards the end of 2014 and early 2015 ( similar to spain , portugal and italy ) , and then syriza screwed everything down . 
  there was a portuguese government official who unironically said something i think was pretty revealing ( and he said it as a boast ) : `` portugal is doing better , the portuguese are n't . '' . 
  he thought this was a point in favour of his government . 
  fact is , syriza or no syriza the money was n't there for the huge payments spike in the month of june . 
  austerity does n't work . 
  no credible economist believes it to work . 
  no country where it has been applied has seen positive results in terms of debt reduction or sustainability . 
  inequality is massively increased by austerity . 
  austerity does n't work because the poor are the majority , and if you keep implementing policies to fuck them over they are going to kick you out of government . 
  you ca n't run a economic policy based on spreadsheets and numbers alone and forget that there are people living a difficult to impossible life because of it . 
  samaras learned it the hard way , and the portuguese and spanish government are set to receive some harsh lessons on that come next election . 
  which i 'm sure you 'd prefer were not held . 
   they need to do it anyway and i 'm sure the greek people do n't need to eat anyway . 
  they do n't like the word country very much these days . 
  protectorate sounds much better , does n't it ? 
  also would prevent those silly greeks from making the same mistakes again . 
  all will be well under the benevolent stewardship of the institutions . 
   one of the first things tsipras did in office was go to a cemetary for victims of the nazis . 
  as the prime minister of a country whose population was a notorious victim of nazi war crimes , that really was an horrible , awful thing to do . 
  how dare he ? 
  but yes im sure historical facts are very humiliating . 
  we should all deny the holocaust did n't happen , that the occupation of greece did n't happen and so forth . 
  or else how will the poor germans deal with such humiliation ? 
  if germany does n't want to pay for what some of their grandfathers did why is it so adamant that greece absolutely must pay ? 
  now rank eu governments by how much they got out of the euro project . 
  germany would be right on top of it . 
  the whole refusal to devalue the currency has always been for their benefit alone . 
   backstab a referendum is a backstab . 
  mkay . 
   tsipras advocated for `` oxi '' / `` no '' , greeks voted the same , now he has done 180-turn and now says that he is ready to implement even harsher measures . 
  tsipras should be out of government of course . 
  i 've said as much after he betrayed his electorate and his mandate . 
   greece 's economy went down the drain in one week + it defaulted on imf debt . 
  greece 's economy went down the drain a long time ago .
