iceland as well . 
  i find it interesting how everyone is an inner nordic according to what i 've been reading ... 
  i think this says more about who made the questionnaire than anything else , or at least how the data is used . 
  edit : or perhaps it shows that people in reddit have similar answers that are more convergent than the average . 
  not sure . 
  i know you 're keeping it simple , but j ca n't really be termed `` north african '' since many of the main haplotypes are signatures of greek/roman colonisation , for example , as well of the european neolithic . 
  the label in the map actually says so , even though they do n't differentiate them in the chart . 
  there is a difference between deep ancestry as given by haplogroups and actual `` perceived '' genetic composition , i.e. 
  what is called autosomal . 
  a map like the above ( or like [ this one ] ( http://i43.tinypic.com/14xj7r.jpg ) with the same topic but with slightly different results , just to give an example of how sample size is relevant , or [ this one with mtdna results ] ( http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/nr/rdonlyres/102bae79-9942-4105-ba33-1ef86929b267/0/londonresultsmtdna_b.jpg ) , which is shows an even more homogeneous spread all over europe ) mainly deals with ancient origins , and is useful for that , but bear in mind that throughout the centuries and different historical processes , climates , etc. 
  populations specialise and adapt , and this changes are not really reflected in the haplogroups since they are mostly unchangeable in nature , while other more visible characteristics have a higher change ratio and are more easily influenced by environment , mutation , etc. 
  this is why the genetic map of europe show a [ geographic relation ] ( http://www.molecularecologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/journal.pgen_.1002886.g002.png ) ( [ another one ] ( http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s0960982208009561-gr1.jpg ) ) , even if the haplogroup distribution favours a more east/west split base on r1b/r1a ( and j/i ) , which in this case shows similarities between iberia and the british isles due to specific pre and proto-historic events that had a certain atlantic affinity ( e.g. 
  [ megalithism ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/megawal31.jpg ) and the celts , mostly , also lbk ( see [ the european mesolithisation of a caucasian neolithic , or the origin of the indo european language family ] ( http://rokus01.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/mesolithisation/ ) - nice [ map ] ( http://rokus01.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lbk-genetic-correlation.jpg ) - for a typical exploration of this complex matters , i.e. 
  the continuity or discontinuity of the neolithic ) both ( haplogroups and autosomal ) are interesting , but have different strengths and applications . 
  some caution is needed since many of this maps vary ( sometimes drastically ) and many revisions have been made in the last decade ( there is all sorts of trends involved , from `` we are all from the ice age '' to `` we are all neolithic '' ) . 
  also , having the same haplogroup does n't mean populations always looked the same - each haplogroup has different haplotypes , which are more restricted and generally have a narrower geographic scope . 
  also note that this intra-european differences are noticeable but are extremely small when compared to anything beyond europe . 
  it is trivial to identify anyone in terms of their `` race '' with superficial genetic sampling , and with a bit more effort is it quite simple to give a geographic approximation . 
  this is a very politically charged topic though . 
  exactly . 
  had i read your comment i would have not even commented !, 
  a shortage ? 
  then surely wages will go up , which will make the profession more attractive and the whole problem will fix itself , since the young italians will be able to buy their expensive cars by working in a segment that is clearly in great need of professionals and with a very interesting growth :  but with a slice of pizza an increasingly popular lunch time option in times of economic hardship , * the pizza sector is booming - and an estimated 6,000 new `` pizzaioili '' are needed , according to fipe , an italian business federation . 
  * so : a booming sector , great prospects , a good idea of what `` young italians '' want , it 's all quite clear to me ... ... unless the whole article is just a way to rationalise `` you see , in the food industry we want to pay shitty wages that nobody here views as appropriate , even though we just said that there is a huge market and a lot of money to be had , so we just make sure that there is a steady supply of egyptians . 
  in order to make this appear less sordid we 'll just call italians lazy and make sure to call `` work ethic '' working without schedules , rights and a decent wage . 
  if the egyptians start getting to picky or unionising we just call them commies and import some containers from a country where people will work for food . '', 
  fucking disgrace , even better when wrapped with some pathetic display of jingoism , which seem to unfortunately be not that uncommon even outside of tabloids in the uk . 
  also , and correct me if i 'm wrong ( really , i heard this from a spanish friend but did n't check it ) , basques were quite happy in squashing rebel movements in other provinces , as long as they maintained the fueros . 
  on another vein , `` fueros '' are a strong component of the carlist movement and other similar catholic integrist movements in the iberian peninsula ( in portugal it applies to municipalities , and `` municipalism '' was a banner of the lusitanian integralist party ) . 
  fueros ( `` foros '' in portuguese ) were very important during the reconquest , if i 'm not mistaken this is why they became such an integral component . 
  the ukraine is weak !, 
  and it was about time , immigration reform in europe was in dire need of drastic changes - biopiracy seems a bit clinical but i suppose it 's to the point . 
  ( edit : though crowd ... ), 
  fuck yeah , put that on a pipe and smoke it frau merkel , we do n't need your lot around here !, 
  we have this volkswagen thing going on , you likely ca n't even spell it right :d, 
  no need to run over hoops explaining : immigration policy is a fundamental instrument of any country and switzerland should determine the numbers , skills , origin , whatever is deemed appropriate , for as long as it is seen as sensible . 
  the `` greek influence in south italy '' was quite bigoted ( they should be lucky if the influence was genuinely greek ) . 
  i think you completely misunderstood what i meant , and seemed to have assumed that i was calling arabs `` greeks '' . 
  i was talking about [ magna graecia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magna_graecia ) and the greek influence in southern italy , which is quite relevant and has even genetic and linguistic evidence today . 
  i will not address the rest of your comment since it does n't apply . 
   a german friend of a friend , who lives in spain , was recently asked to leave an unrelated public protest on the sole basis that she was german . 
  mediterranean media need to quit the fear-mongering and hate towards everything northern . 
  it 's neither constructive nor desirable , for anyone . 
  this surprises me a lot , also because i work with several northern europeans in lisbon . 
  quite honestly all the reports of `` northern fearmongering '' i 've read are from people from northern europe that extrapolate what their media says about southern europe ( and the reception it has on the public ) . 
  apart from silly `` merkel with a hitler moustache '' posters here and there , and which are impossible to avoid since there is always someone who thinks it is a good idea even it , `` northern blaming '' in the media is generally not populist in terms at all and is mostly concerned about economic policies . 
  i mean , most people do n't even have a complete concept of `` bad northern europe !, 
  '' , it 's mostly the germans that take the blame , and even then germans that support a certain economic policy ... still , not doubting you , there are idiots all over . 
   the latino thing is pretty bothering . 
  we are n't into that category . 
  i know , and neither are we or spaniards . 
  the thing is , it 's a bit ridiculous to have a word like `` latino '' that excludes those from the region whose name gave birth to the word . 
  it is not unlike `` hispanic '' in that regard . 
   actually if you learn about our history i know your history , at least broadly speaking . 
  i also follows population genetics publications , etc. 
   northern italians are closer to germans than to anyone else as genetics . 
  ugh , i 'm not going to enter * that * fight , which infests every genetics forum that ever existed  i will leave the following maps ( which do not show deep ancestry btw ) for those interested in the topic at large ( and not specifically regarding italy : this is important , they are not a reply to your comment but more a general reference ) : ] [ european genetics show a geographical affinity # 1 ] ( http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/wp-content/blogs.dir/474/files/2012/04/i-840c54aa761e3e917a2cc4f71aacd735-geneticeuropemap.jpg ) and [ # 2 ] ( http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p217/dpwes/lao2008.jpg ) and [ # 3 ] ( http://www.beerkens.info/blog/uploaded_images/geneseurope.jpg ) i will note however that even someone from northern italy can be included in any of the above misconceptions , mainly because the point is that the idea that europeans that are not `` blonde '' are `` swarthy '' due to `` the arabs '' is incorrect and is mostly a product of a political discourse that reflects a certain period of time in terms of power struggle . 
   i do n't really see what we have to do with arabs . 
  sure they conquered spain so maybe there goes the conviction for spain . 
  but us ? 
  because they also conquered part of nowadays italy , as you yourself remark ? 
  your comment could be interpreted as a sort of `` yeah , sure , look * there * , not here '' . 
  i also see that frequently in forums worldwide , hence my remark ( and i hope you do n't take offence ) . 
  as i said the reason why this is used in not because those using it are experts in genetics and history , so it hardly matters if it is right or wrong . 
   i mean , yeah , the south was ruled by arabs but it was also ruled by normans . 
  quite true ( also , the greek influence in parts of southern italy is important ) ; i will note that all of iberia was also ruled by visigoths and others , but around here this is hardly seen as something to brag about : there is no real attachment to the idea , i suppose because spain and portugal have their identity defined more in terms of themselves ( and the reconquista ) than anything else , or more broadly speaking in terms of the hispano-roman population . 
  germanic invasions are important mostly because of the symbolism of the reconquista as a `` restoration '' . 
  this is somewhat relevant here as well , namely the use of usa-derived `` ethnic categories '' , like `` latinos '' and `` hispanics '' and other group descriptions that have either no meaning at all or are extremely badly used . 
  also , as you say , the apparent conviction that is one is n't blonde this is due to arabs or some derivation thereof . 
  although this does n't really fall within the `` have no idea it is offensive '' . 
  yes , that 's what i understood from your previous message , it 's all clear , 
  i see what you mean , although i would consider that more the `` route '' the word took than strictly the `` root '' ( which if i 'm not mistaken is the same in all languages that use that expression ) . 
  but yes , good point , it could have been introduced indirectly , sort of like a latin-based word that reaches a language via an english expression . 
  i think the etymological root is actually the same , since the fruit is named after the country , but i suspected that different terms had likely evolved , thank you !, 
  [ sweet orange was introduced in europe by the portuguese ] ( http://users.kymp.net/citruspages/sweetoranges.html#portugal ) , from china , in the xiv century ( i think ) , which is what i heard underpins the use of this root . 
   it is perhaps worth mentioning that the word orange always referred to the sour orange ( citrus aurantium ) from the 11th century to the end of the 18th century . 
  ** it was only after the portuguese started importing new varieties directly from china in the first half of the 17th century that a new type called portugal orange slowly spread to other parts of southern europe . 
  the first modern type of sweet orange tree was imported to portugal in 1635 . 
  by 1650 it was known also in france and italy . 
  the fruit was sweet and could be eaten fresh , unlike other citrus fruits known at the time . 
  in many countries it was called portugal orange ; in fact the name of orange is still indentical to the name of portugal in many languages : in greece ( portokalo ) , in parts of italy ( portogallo ) and in albania , romania and several countries in the near east . 
  ** elsewhere it was called sweet orange or china orange . 
  its scientific name became citrus sinensis ( chinese citrus ) . 
  the building of special greenhouses to protect citrus fruit from frost ( orangeries ) became more common around the time of the spreading of the new sweet orange . 
  in the green countries , is the name of the fruit the same as portugal the country , or is it a variation ? 
  always was curious about this . 
   `` we should focus in technology and this and that '' . 
  `` the sea '' is one that pops around here every odd year , in addition to `` technology '' and the elusive `` high margin products '' . 
  truth be told that with the recent events the bet seems to be on `` industry and agriculture '' , although mostly in terms of lip service . 
   the relations between the basques and the icelanders were cordial , except for one instance where around 80 basques were murdered by local farmers . 
  today that is considered to have been a shameful episode in the history of the country thank you , that was quite interesting to read !, 
  we were also quite involved in terranova and the north atlantic , but not for whaling , mostly fishing ( and particularly cod fishing ) , but not related to iceland ( reaching newfoundland was in a joint-venture with the danes iirc ) . 
  sorry , i forgot to mention that my reply to you completely disregarded the original topic :d when i said `` founder effect '' i was n't implying any sort of `` icelanders are all cousins and therefore retarded lol '' , this is nonsense and only exists because nowadays there is a certain stigma on genetically homogeneous populations , and the `` incest-related diseases '' is a popular weapon . 
  as you said 8/9th cousins mean little or nothing , especially when there is n't a specific recessive mutation that is endemic . 
   about the number of the original settlers , some estimates are that they were around 20.000 , others are higher . 
  and even if the country was linguistically and culturally pretty isolated from the continent for a long time , there were of course periodic arrivals of ships , full of men ... which had n't seen a woman for a long time yes , correct me if i 'm wrong but iceland was a common outpost for atlantic fishing , and there was even a sort of basque/icelandic creole at one time ...  some towns saw a lot of french ships - and curiously enough people originally from those places tend to have a bit of a darker complexion and darker eyes than icelanders on average i find that believable , although i would note that some caution as to the origins should be taken : it is quite popular to attribute `` darker features '' ( mostly hair/eyes , also complexion ) to recent admixture , but that is not always so . 
  one example that comes to mind are the `` black irish '' , which were thought to be `` descendants of the survivors of the spanish armada '' , but that is not so , it is related to a much more ancient source , namely the celts/pre-celts . 
  could be that your example is spot-on though . 
  you are right , but i think they meant that in iceland `` founder effect '' is amplified since there was a relatively small number of original colonisers , and that most people on iceland are therefore related . 
  this is true for most other places in europe ( even ones which had a more complex history in terms of invasions , here in portugal i have found that most people are related once xviii century is reached ) , but particularly so in iceland because it 's an island and has a very good record of population movement , settlement and progeny .
