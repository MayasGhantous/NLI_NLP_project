  great decision , only suffers from limited scope imo . 
  if people do n't like the constitution , then they should change it . 
  having a president whose first duty is to uphold the constitution using pathetic coup-outs like last yeat ( `` yes , it is likely against the constitution , so i wo n't even send it there since i think we need it , mmkay ? '' ), 
  is bad enough , having a government who thinks that their first duty is with the troika only makes matters worse . 
  and for those who agree with the measures : it 's not a matter of even agreeing with them , is the idea that the rule of law should be bypassed as to avoid `` making waves '' that will upset `` the markets '' . 
  it 's akin to `` suspending democracy '' since that `` gets things done quicker '' . 
  do n't like the `` socialist '' constitution that has outdated things like universal education , universal healthcare and worker 's rights ? 
  just give more votes to those that can change it ( or just abolish it altogether ) . 
  until that day the constitution exists ** exactly ** to prevent this kind of decisions and policies . 
  thank you !, 
  i was n't sure if it would be appreciated but this subreddit was the right place for it , 
  sorry , love you to , went out for some cigs but then things got weird , lost track of time ... 
  we should have thought of that in 711 , much aggro would 've been avoided . 
  that 's pretty much it , and in all honesty you know more than most  there is plenty of stuff in how we got from a small country born of the reconquest , to worldwide empire fighting a global war , our part in the counter-reformation , to pretty much secondary in world politics in the xix century and then the republic and fascistic regime , and then the eu with a lot of areas underdeveloped , but those are i think the major points . 
  as with everything is is interesting to know some of them in more detail since they explain a lot of we are at today , including our limitations and current balance of power . 
  as for the circles , it 's an april 1st thing , we are supposed to be members of team fortress playing against each other . 
  for example , i just used a `` wand of cursory gestures '' on you which changes your cursor , not sure if having an hat affects the effect though . 
  blame merkel !, 
  thank you , it 's an interest of mine so i try my best . 
  should you ever have any specific question about portuguese history just fire it up in the future , reddit is great for this sort of things , i have learned a lot by talking to people around here . 
  ps : just noted that you have a orangish circle , and i a blueish one . 
  i 'm not sure what this means but i have the feeling i should not be talking to you since you are the enemy . 
  yes , we had an authoritarian government for a good part of the xx century - many would call it fascist although this is somewhat disputed . 
  it was partially a result of the instability of the republic and partially because it followed similar movements across all europe at the time . 
  during the 1930 's it was almost given as a certainty that strong nationalist , authoritarian right-wing governments were the only option to `` bolshevism '' , hence the popularity of it . 
  the local brand of nationalism and imperialism was centred around salazar a bit to much for the regime 's sake , apart from that it was a mix of integralism , imperialism , corporativism and authoritarianism . 
  still , you mention one important point ( and note that i come from a family of anti-fascist fighters ) : there was no systematic genocide involved . 
  there was persecutions , people died , but it was not something either common or systematic . 
  the closest i can think of was the prologued war in africa , but i do not think it should be seen as similar at all , regardless of the death toll . 
  still , i 'm not saying that it could n't have happened , especially when we consider that we were doing something similar centuries before , with blood cleanliness laws and mass expulsion of jews , public burnings , etc. 
  one should also note that the current situation as certain elements of the first republic and also seems to be rehabilitating the `` estado novo '' in the eyes of some , while at the same time making it easier for some `` strong leader '' to appear and `` end up with this pseudo-democratic feast of the corrupt few '' . 
  scary stuff . 
  yes , i understand the issues , both the recent ones you mention and even those before then ( the hrr , the outcomes of the spring of nations in 1848 , gro\u00dfdeutschland vs. kleindeutschland , kulturkampft , latter on the anschlu\u00df , etc ) . 
  quite honestly i 'm of the opinion that there is a limit to using nazism as a sort of sword of damocles , a limit that has imo been largely abused for some time now . 
  each country has a different sense on nationhood , and i have found that history is a great help in showing why that happens , and why they are all equally important - they just look `` strange '' because they follow different lines . 
  i think that the average german is not that different from the average portuguese or any other average european in that the analysis is mostly made based on recent history and more or less easy to grasp data ; when one starts talking about long-term effects it all gets a bit messier and is likely much more difficult to explain . 
  not that i disagree with you , and i have the feeling that this is going to end badly . 
  but i ca n't shake the feeling that even this is largely our fault , basically because nobody had to the balls to actually refuse the bailout and see the circus burn . 
  additionally there is one big problem with `` southern europe '' ( i 'm not even addressing ireland ) : it exists in the mind of others , but not in the mind of actual southern europeans . 
  unlike some definition of northern europe , southern europe is hardly something uniform . 
  what we have in common is largely derived from the concept of romanitas , but e.g. 
  for us outside of iberia there is no specific link that really has any emotional significance . 
  which could explain how every single country just turned their backs on the previous victim . 
  i understand what you 're saying , but ... why should they ? 
  i mean , it 's working out for them ... the case could be made that in the medium term it would work out better , but still , it 's not exactly an easy sell to tell germans that they should increase inflation in order to allow others to breath , particularly when they are not so dependent on those markets . 
  you 're all mad , the way you casually joke about this it 's impressive . 
   i 'm a bit far away but felt really uneasy with the map , the idea of simply removing a country like that , even just coming up with the idea , is something that makes me cringe . 
  i know that in central europe countries and borders are a bit more fluid , there is more regional autonomy and overall less dependency of a central , unified state ( my perception by studying it , at least ) , but perhaps because it is so recent something like this makes me uneasy . 
  a very decent question , and one which i had to dig around a bit to find !, 
  i found most of the answers in portuguese media , but see bellow for further sources . 
  the overall idea seems that there is no real difference in terms of actual use ; there is a lot of political posturing concerning this policy so most sources are biased one way or the other , but overall the number of hard drug users seems to be little affected by the policy . 
  now , one must consider that the main opposition to the law was that it would fuel a brutal increase in drug addiction and turn portugal into a `` drug haven for drug tourists '' . 
  this has n't happened . 
  additionally health indicators such as hiv infections in drug users have been drastically reduced . 
  some important social results have been possible , mainly because many hard drug users have little to no family support , are homeless , etc , and the mandatory counselling includes social services that can make a difference . 
  one idea i got though was that decriminalisation by itself is not a magic bullet and that it is mostly concerned with `` damage reduction '' - it is not a prevention measure . 
  it is a heavily politically charged issue and most sources tend to be somewhat biased . 
  personally though , one big different i have noticed was perception ... lisbon during the late 80s/90s had some spots that were unbearable , with drug trafficking made in broad daylight , people roaming around looking for a fix , horrible stuff . 
  that being said , and now that most if not all of this places have been reconverted , perhaps the reason things look much better was because people were all sent to city projects and others ca n't see them :( while searching around i have found some interesting data by the emcdda ( coincidentally based in lisbon ) . 
  amidst all the turmoil and ill-will that the current crisis makes manifest i find that these organisations are one of the most visible proofs of the advantages of european integration ( for different values of integration , not making a federalist plea ! ) . 
  hope this provides some additional `` hard numbers '' , although i found no information comparing drug usage over a decade or something like that : [ 2012 annual report on the state of the drugs problem in europe ] ( http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/annual-report/2012 ) [ social reintegration and employment : evidence and interventions for drug users in treatment ] ( http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/insights/social-reintegration ), 
  i know about that crisis , and note that my comment is not at all meant as a `` buuuh , finns are bad ! '', 
  kind of thing , it is mostly concerned with perception and the way things are said and repeated . 
  there are some differences in terms of the mechanisms available to deal with this situation , namely the fact that we do not have our own currency and that almost all our markets are also contracting , but this are details , overall i ( and actually we , this is the common sentiment `` in the street '' ) know fully well that others have underwent economic depression and cuts and have dealt with them with no little personal cost . 
  everyone knows that something like that is needed and indeed things are fast approaching a state of social collapse . 
  part of the problem for me if that being part of the euro and having the bulk of the debt owned by foreign institutions makes it almost impossible to avoid even accepting a bailout since it would have a detrimental effect and nobody wants that . 
  on the other hand the measures being implemented with such extreme zeal locally have pretty much failed , with the troika saying that `` perhaps we did a slight error , it 's not a 0.5 reduction per euro they achieve , it 's perhaps 1.3 per euro ... ooops '' . 
  so in some ways the policies and the bailouts are themselves stipulated from outside . 
  what you are proposing is quite correct . 
  it is also something that would be within the very first targets of cuts . 
  i know this because in portugal ( where meals are provided ) schools have had to start reinforcing lunches because it was becoming obvious that the only hot meal some kids had was the one in schools . 
  now , they will do this while there 's money , or while they can ** borrow it ** . 
  afterwards they will be called irresponsible for increasing the school deficit . 
  i 'm not really knowledgeable about the situation in greece , and again i stress that i absolutely agree with you , but everything you said is the target behind the austerity measures . 
  indeed many have said that more than anything the measures are strictly political in nature and deal with the privatisation of everything , more than anything to do with being able to pay public debt . 
  yes , that 's right . 
  still , this has indirectly led to a sort of `` natural split '' in terms of the dealers , those who deal mostly will weed , and then the others . 
  not sure exactly what is the reason though but i do not think it is unrelated - note that i have always been a supporter of the dutch model ( and not for personal reasons , even after sampling several different products my poisons of choice remain strictly legal ! ), 
  because of the way it allows removing the contact with the more `` heavy '' stuff when one just wants some weed or mdma . 
  maybe someone else can explain why the decriminalisation also improved `` market separation '' , i will do some research to see if i can find something for you though . 
  in terms of treatment , this is where it all sort of comes together : getting caught with drugs is not something completely indifferent : you do n't go to jail , but you ** do ** go to a mandatory medical counselling session . 
  this provides the opportunity to have access to treatment which would otherwise not be available . 
  on a related note , this sort of stuff is the one that is likely to suffer the most from `` austerity measures '' since it is very easy to just cut from the `` no-good addicts '' that should just be `` disposed '' ( vox populi ) . 
  that would actually be great since it would be somewhat less detached . 
  the eu is great ... 
  i always liked finland and have been progressively starting to dislike it with the years . 
  no offence to finns around here but the eu position of finland seems to reduce itself with `` we just joined the party , but we dislike the music and will put our dicks in the mashed potatoes . 
  also , we 're not paying for whatever since you should n't need it '' . 
  note that i 'm not addressing the issues themselves , that is a different matter , just the perception of finland . 
  correct , it 's decriminalised from a user perspective , it is still illegal ( obviously , since otherwise we would not be talking about decriminalisation but full legalisation , including of selling it , paying taxes , etc ) . 
  i also agree that the effect is much better than the alternative , since it does n't make sense so push rehabilitation at the same time people are jailed . 
  in portugal the main point of contention is , i think , the 16-year-old limit for buying wine and beer ( the rest is 18 ) . 
  there is some pressure to make it 18 but it is still 16 in the last revision , partially because of the wine and beer industries in portugal . 
  smoking everywhere was pretty much the norm until roughly a decade ago , now restaurants can choose and most closed spaces are non-smoking , so there was a rather quick shift in behaviour there ( most people have already assimilated that they go outside to smoke as a rule ) . 
  selling to minors is something that is known to happen , mainly on small towns where everyone knows each other , although automatic vending machines now require remote unblocking . 
  the minimum age is of 18 years ( everything in portugal becomes possible at 18 years ) . 
  as for drugs , it is decriminalised , which is different from being accepted of course . 
  there us really no big debate about the issue , meaning that mostly nobody really objects to decriminalisation . 
  inedded , smith is the most common one !, 
  i picked ferrier mainly because , although rarer , it has the same root .
