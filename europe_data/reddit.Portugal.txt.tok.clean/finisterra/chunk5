  not really a very substantial contribution to the debate , i know . 
   complexity is different from superiority . 
  where did i wrote that ? 
  you did n't , which is why i made it clear that not only you did n't wrote it , i was also not implying that you even suggested it . 
  i took the opportunity to make a comment that was spurred by your words but not directed at them . 
   also the nasal sounds are not even perceived/heard by foreigners as their ears are not familiar with the sound at first encounters . 
  i suppose that is certainly true for many nasal sounds , but my comment about them is based on historical writings of english travellers which mention the nasal sounds as somewhat off-putting , but adding that the way they are actually used is much `` softer '' than expected and hence not a strong point against the language . 
  hahaha , i found it funny how suddenly we were all over the thread , gives real meaning to `` h\u00e1 mouro na costa ! '', 
  which are , to be honest , not especially pleasing most of the times ( the nasal sounds ) ; actually foreign appreciation of the language is that it 's pretty nice and poetic , but the nasal sounds are not that great ( which is also why they are n't `` fully expressed '' by most dialects ) . 
  additionally , having more vowel sounds is not a sign of superiority ( not saying you suggested that it was !, 
  ) , some people actually dislike the sound of to many vowels . 
  curiously portuguese is closer to catalan and valencian in this regard . 
   `` cu carne de vaca nu se moare de foame '' yeah , especially today when we can get all our beef from horses . 
  hehe , no problem at all , i understood but since we are talking to other europeans i thought it would be useful to further qualify it . 
  it also prompted me to investigate the matter a bit more ( which is always good ) . 
  some highlights ( i can provide sources if any of them catches someone 's fancy !, 
  ) : * portuguese vocabulary is 80 % latin , 20 % celtic/iberian/germanic / arabic/others * during the middle ages the arabic-derived words in the mix above words was higher than today , mainly because the concepts were specific to the situation in the peninsula and have since then either disappeared , been replaced by latin words or became less well-known ( example : in brazil they still use the word `` almoxarifado '' for a common stocking area , whereas in europe we use the terms `` economato '' ... note that `` almoxarifado '' is derived from a territorial division in the middle ages and related to the word `` xerife '' ) * during the renaissance there was a reintroduction of latin and greek words , some of who displaced the previous ones . 
  * there is a project number of 1000 words of arabic origin ; in this are included words which are also present in most other languages ( e.g. 
  `` cotton '' is arabic , like `` algod\u00e3o '' ) . 
  * most words beginning with `` al '' are actually * not * arabic , but latin . 
  this is especially true for almost all verbs . 
  this one is quite tricky since people have assumed that `` al '' means `` arabic word '' when it 's a common prefix in latin as well ( and generally say that things like `` almo\u00e7o '' - lunch - and `` al\u00e9m '' - over there - are arabic when they are in fact latin ) * most portuguese names and surnames have a germanic origin or an hebrew/aramaic origin ( via the bible ) * several distinguishing sounds are indeed generally related to the influence of celtic , but to which extent it is had to know * `` oxal\u00e1 '' is a common saying in portuguese and spanish , and is of arabic origin , but it was n't obtained from muslims but , like almost all the other words , from the [ mozarabs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozarab ) , which were christian natives living under muslim rule and which spoke arabic or mozarabic - this included visigoths , and reminds me what would latter happen in jerusalem after the cruzades . 
  * germanic vocabulary is mostly related to warfare, 
   the structure is latin based , much like spanish , french and italian , with a touch of arabic ( which i 'm particulary fond of ) nitpick , but the structure is n't based on arabic at all . 
  some vocabulary ( and seldom verbs ) , like in spanish , is derived from arabic since it refers items that were introduced at the time , in a similar way to most germanic vocabulary ( which also did n't affect the structure of the language ) . 
  the phonetic is , like most other languages , mostly derived from the pre-latin substrate ( a mix of celtic and pre-celtic tribes ) . 
  yeah , that 's my perspective as well , and while this whole `` let 's blame germany '' thing fails : because even when assuming that ( gasp ! ), 
  the german government does what is best for germans and not necessarily for others , ** it 's still our fault for allowing it ** . 
  it 's utterly ridiculous to blame others for doing what one should be doing . 
  if anything i blame local politicians even more because of this since it adds na\u00efvety to incompetence . 
  can we , er , sublet ours ? 
  nobody dislikes germans , as a rule , either now or before . 
  also , southern europe is hardly uniform . 
   i completely disagree with even the way this question was written as it assumes too much . 
  exactly , it seems to be trendy now to repeat a question whose purpose is not so much to get answers but to implicitly crystallise a certain thought . 
  sort of `` why are we so great and you so lame ? '', 
  i have mentioned this in my previous comment , and i see this victimisation as an interesting side-effect of the way the eu has progressed ( or not ) . 
   as a german , i 'm really pissed that we are the scapegoat for all those incompetent domestic politicans that do n't have the guts to tell their people how bad they are really off . 
  one thing to note is that the idea that everyone , everywhere , is always `` blaming the germans '' is something that is also somewhat fostered by the media , which seems to go out of their way to find the one sign that mentions merkel amongst thousands of others . 
  this is because it makes better news , and also because i seem to detect a certain pattern of victimisation of germany , for one , and a sort of revanchism , for other , in the way that things are portrayed . 
  i have n't followed in great detail the reaction in cyprus , but as for the rest of your comment let me assure you that around here the vast majority of people are well aware that the fault falls entirely upon themselves . 
  time is more than ready to put an end to this euro experience , eu-wide trading agreements , etc , etc , i 'm sure that everbody would survive and would mean less drama . 
  self-reply because unfortunately something happened that is relevant : [ youth dies after police chase ] ( http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=3112821&amp;seccao=sul ) ( pt ) the comments in there are rather vile ( by this i mean that they are highly xenophobic , racist , etc , the neighbourhood is question has a majority gypsy and african population ) , and many of them say that `` ahh yes , a `` youth '' , say no more ! '' . 
  this was what i was trying to convey : that even when neutral words are used to remove any reference to the ethnic background of the involved those same words start to be used as `` code '' . 
  i think that this was actually something used in the us , something about referring to black americans by using some other terms which would resonate with those `` in the know '' . 
  also ... this is something that even varies according to country : i have noticed that uk media is quite refrained when describing domestic issues , but whenever someone does a crime abroad and is from an ethnic minority they use the wonderful sentence '' ... an individual carrying an uk passport ... '', 
  i understand , but do note that i was talking about the media and how different words are used to identify something without using adjectives that would be or sound inappropriate . 
  i think that even considering british tabloids `` fucking immigrants '' was never very popular in the media , 
  you are correct , they seemed to be called `` youths '' mostly , at least that is the `` code word '' that i have detected in several countries . 
  should have thought about that life choice before settling then !, 
  plot twist : it 's made from horse milk . 
  well , we for one would start to put into a wider context what really is to have shitty neighbours in a peninsula ... jk of course . 
  more ontopic , i can think of the following possibilities : * i 'm not sure if nk can target europe ... maybe they are crazy enough to go out in a blast * korea is very relevant in terms of tech , that would certainly have an economic impact * we would likely witness a reassessment of the need to be well armed , country-wise , and the tole of nato , etc. 
  * perhaps the whole globalisation thing would suffer a bit ... 
  i mean , things like this show that putting everything abroad is likely not the best idea in the world when shit hits the fan, 
  ... and in two bullet points you condensed what i took several full sentences to say - we 're doing our part in keeping stereotypes applicable :d, 
  agreed . 
  i think most of us react badly because it sounds to much `` i 'm saying this because it is n't french !, 
  '' , but in the end the idea of legitimising a standard european language would do more harm than good imo . 
  actually , and as someone who likes to think that he has half decent english ( or at least whose main foreign language is english ) , i find it extremely convenient when english is used , but the idea of formalising it somehow as one step above the others makes me uncomfortable to be honest , it sort of makes me feel like i 'm `` betraying '' portuguese ... maybe this is something more closely felt by those who attach some kind of imperial prestige ( rightly or wrongly ) to the language ? 
  no , no downvotes , was just afraid to be misinterpreted . 
  your position is clear and it is similar if not the same as mine , so we 're done here , cheers !, 
  oh , i agree , the uk has the strongest claim , but that is imo due to a mix of many different arguments , not * solely * the will of current inhabitants !, 
  that was my point , which was kind of lost perhaps . 
   if they gave a fuck about what an ancient pope once said the other islands they claim would be portuguese !, 
  finally someone discovered my hidden motivation !, 
  i do get what you say though , it 's not an easy topic . 
  in any event , and in another reply in this thread , i mentioned that my main point is that the actions that led to a certain demographic situation must be analysed before using the will of the inhabitants as the definitive criteria , in order to prevent post hoc legitimation of deportations , demographic warfare , etc. 
  first , a foreword : i have seem to have become some kind of argentinian irrendentist in the eyes of many in this thread . 
  nothing is further from the truth , for several reasons , including the fact that i do n't actually have a stake in it , nor any territorial dispute with the uk , or even a strong opinion on the issue itself - the uk is most likel your points are valid and i broadly agree with them - actually , i agree with them quite a lot . 
  they mean , however , that * the will of the current inhabitants is n't the only criteria that should be used * , which is my point from the start . 
  there are additional factors that must be accounted for , namely how those inhabitants ended up in there , if there were deportations of others thus altering demography , etc , etc. 
  ** this ** was my main point in this debate , since i have seen the `` just hold a vote ! '', 
  angle being used in situations that are completely different , and it is insidious in they way it sort of resembles democracy , thus becoming an easy to exploit argument to legitimise all sorts of practices that play on demography . 
   pretty sure it never was . 
  that 's a separate matter though , not directly related to the will of the current inhabitants . 
  and for me it 's something that should be considered , which is my whole point : there is a lot more to consider in this situations than the vote of current inhabitants . 
  furthermore i 'm not implying that argentina `` is right '' in this regard . 
   so there 's spain with highly questionable claim to the islands , and argentina with a way worse one . 
  if the claims were strong , i mean , if they were 100 % certain , would that mean something in terms of how you consider the situation ? 
  would that invalidate the referendum ? 
   i bet next you 'll point out that pope gave it to spain as something someone should give a fuck about . 
  people are free to give a fuck , or not , to whatever you or i point out . 
  fortunately you do n't need to bet on what i would possibly say since i 'm here to reply to any comments . 
   they can inherit the claim , they can inherit the dispute , those are just words , they can not inherit ownership of something their parent country did n't own in the first place . 
  that 's my point . 
  the concept of ownership is implied in their claim , or dispute of ownership - even if they are completely wrong about it . 
  most former colonies inherited territorial disputes as well , which were solved in varying ways through the years . 
  i 'm not , however , talking about who is right or wrong in terms of the ownership claim and i never addressed this in my comments , which are solely related to the use of the will of current inhabitants ad the * nec plus ultra * in terms of final decision , and even this as a general concept in terms of international relationships . 
   i do n't think it 's delicate at all tbh , there is a thousands-strong community that has lived on the islands for centuries , even entertaining the idea that they should be forcibly deported , demographically emasculated or violently eliminated in 2013 is preposterous in my mind . 
  i agree , which i why i find the whole `` let 's just a vote with those that live there right now '' approach extremely dangerous , since it legitimises deportation , demographic emasculation and violent elimination by making it something that can be used as sole criteria to determine ownership , and something that ca n't be reversed since doing so would invalidate the entire principle . 
   the islands were never argentina 's '' property , so even if you bought their flimsy argument , it should be spain staking its claim , no ? 
  i am talking about the `` it 's the current inhabitants will that counts '' argument that was being used , not any other . 
  the falklands seem to be a very delicate topic since it seems that there was always a lot of overlap in terms of * de jure * rulers , i.e. 
  at the same time different countries were assuming that they were the rulers of it . 
  still , my argument is * not * against the uk in this matter , i do not have a completely defined opinion on the topic since i have n't read about it enough . 
  in any event argentina became independent of spain , and there are surely agreements concerning that , so like any former colony it has jurisdiction over the territory that was claimed and recognised ... 
  i think that is what they actually use as the argument :  argentina posits that it gained the falkland islands from spain , upon becoming independent from it in 1816 , and that the uk illegally occupied them in 1833 ( ... ) argentina claims that , in 1833 , the uk expelled argentine authorities and settlers from the falklands with a threat of `` greater force '' and that the uk afterwards barred argentines from resettling the islands, 
   you 're right , `` was '' . 
  they have just as much business there as i have in my former home .
