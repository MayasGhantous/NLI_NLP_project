  one rather interesting development is that while the imf was seen as the `` bad guy '' some weeks ago , today it is being seen as a better partner than the eu . 
  the conditions proposed by the imf are actually better than the ones that the eu is trying to push . 
  some commentators have said that in this day and age the imf is actually adopting more `` left wing '' policies than the eu . 
  indeed , being in the government means compromising and losing a great deal of the appeal . 
  brilliant stuff mate , thanks . 
  i still think that the rise of parties like the `` true finns '' is in general something that is dismissed without taking a look at the roots of their popularity . 
  i know of plenty of left-wing workers around here that would subscribe to more than half of the ideas you ascribed to them ( minus modern art , and perhaps the gay/lesbian thing . 
  and swedish , of course ) . 
  ... do we get the money ... or what ? 
  ( ps : see recent history , i sort of agree with the true finns in terms of the bailout . 
  i could n't help joking about it though ) . 
   could you elaborate on this ? 
  sure . 
  let me however begin by saying that while i have several opinions on the subject i have no illusion that these are complex matters and my positions can be simplistic , wrong , or both . 
  i 'm assuming that finland 's economy is no island and that it depends on the economy of their neighbours , but especially germany and others central/eastern european countries . 
  the bailout in portugal is not something that the rest of europe received by surprise or with concern : strong pressures existed from european bodies for months prior to the capitulation urging portugal to throw the towel to the floor . 
  the reason for this is that the often talked about alternative - defaulting - would have a much broader impact . 
  had portugal chosen to default and restructure the debt ( something i think would have served our interest better ) this would have an impact on the financial institutions that were exposed to this debt , not unlike the drama with iceland . 
  in particular , the banking systems of france , germany and spain would be affected . 
  a look at the situation in spain in terms of the `` cajas '' , but also the ones from several banks in germany which failed the stress-tests ( the value of which are a separate debate ) , would most likely mean that the situation would deteriorate quickly . 
  especially so given the impact in spain , which would then have an even bigger impact on the rest of the countries . 
  my comment was about this : if portugal defaults that has an immediate impact on several banking institutions in several countries . 
  the notation agencies , serving their own veiled interests , would immediately start attacking spain , which would worsen the situation . 
  at that point spain could also default ( even because the sheer size of it makes any debate about a bailout of portugal seem like pennies ) . 
  given that a vast majority of the money was `` borrowed '' from german banking institutions ( among others ) , this would have a huge impact and at the very least would mean mass bankruptcy of financial institutions or , in alternative , an extremely large bailout promoted by the central banks of the affected countries . 
  this would , in any case , have an effect on the economy of said countries , which would trickle down to finland - this assuming that finnish banking institutions were not directly affected to begin with . 
  not that this should change the position of the finns : just that they would have to be prepared to deal with some of the consequences , which i think is something they would be more than capable of doing . 
  i actually agree with a lot of what they say . 
  i think they underestimate the impact that a lack of intervention in portugal would have in finland , but that 's just a detail . 
  which is why i 'm of the opinion that we should have defaulted , and ultimately leave the eurozone . 
  while it lasts there is hardly any hope of real economic growth . 
  the idea that the euro would mean a `` more responsible economic policy '' was nonsense and ultimately dangerous in both ways : it made some think that they could do whatever they wanted since `` we 're in the euro , we 're safe , waste away ! '', 
  and also limited the enactment of policies that could have a real effect . 
  like defaulting , for example , which is what should have happened . 
  honestly , upon reading it i do note that i was a bit partial in terms of not exploring more the `` democratic right wing '' pov ( psd , cds ) . 
  the reason is not my personal bias , it 's just that by the time i arrived at that point i was already tired :p i edited slightly just to separate my `` deportation '' comment from the `` neo-liberal '' one . 
  different things . 
  well , that was fun . 
  who 's next ? 
   enjoy the weather . 
  ouch . 
  so many things implied in such a small statement , 
   unfortunately not just rumours sorry , my humour was highly dependent on context , i said it minutes after the official declaration of the pm on national television . 
   how are things in portugal ? 
  that 's a very open-ended question  i can give you some very general answer , trying to cover many different sensibilities . 
  when i speak in imperative form it should n't be read as `` i support this '' , i 'm trying to convey the * vox populi * ** some feel betrayed , the imf request is seen as a capitulation that should have been avoided no matter what . 
  ** * of these , some blame the government for the policies in the latest years , they should have reduced public spending more , etc , etc. 
  * others the opposition for not approving the latest austerity package , it created the final destabilisation that put an end to the government strategy of pushing on until the eu comes up with something out of fear of the crisis reaching countries tha would need billions and billions more in terms of rescue . 
  * others the previous governments , all the way to the one of the current president , or even all the elected government ( `` during the estado novo we did n't owe anything to anyone and had the coffers full of gold !, 
  those were the days , today this is filled with debauchery , corrupt politicians and africans . '' ), 
  * on this vein , others blame the imf , the eu and the jews that are behind the banking system . 
  this week announcement from the banks saying that they would not lend money and that they wanted the imf gave rise to a sociologically interesting increase in comments mentioned jews , marranos , etc , etc. 
  * others the eu at large since the situation only reached this point to to leniency and outright complicity . 
  leaving the euro is seen as an option since the policies being promoted are purposely made to simultaneously stifle growth and make it appear as a huge favour . 
  * others blame the overall right-wing policies , neo-liberalism , etc. 
  there are signs of a rather marked increase in left-wing ( communist party , left bloc , etc ) rhetoric in a much newer generation ( the portuguese eurovision song is a half-in-jest song that speaks about `` the people marching on , singing against the reaction ! '', 
  and a opo hit song speaks about `` one has to study to be a wage-slave '' , etc ) ** some say that it should have been done longer ago ** * in an opposite movement there are also some that stress the need for neo-liberal measures and the popularity of the christian democrats ( to the right of the right-wing part that generally rotates in the government ) is also rising . 
  * for others immigration is a problem that must be controlled , violence is rising while the natives birth rate is dropping , writing is on the wall , deportation , etc , etc. 
  * others simply think that the shock measures that come with the imf are needed for competitiveness reasons . 
  * others submit that the imf is n't a bogeyman , all 's well , it 's bau . 
  ** some are just still trying to figure out what it means ** * some think that the measures will only affect `` the lazy '' , which are generally public workers , teachers , anyone working for the state * others are concerned about the cuts since they are just barely middle-class ( which is eroding ) . 
  * others do not really care since they ca n't imagine being worse of . 
  * others are actually concerned about spain being next . 
  despite the historical rivalry there is some genuine concern there , which is nice actually . 
  apart from this , things are pretty good in portugal . 
  sure , the economy is fucked , we 're also pretty fucked ( and we have ourselves to blame ) , but the weather is actually improving lately , so that counts for something . 
  we , as a people , are very little inclined to public manifestations of violence , so that 's good i suppose . 
  although this could change , there is a limit for everything . 
  bah , rumours , all rumours i say !, 
  i have progressively seen an increase in comments saying the same in online portuguese news sites , especially so when the banks said this week that they would stop lending money and would force an imf intervention , which is sociologically interesting and an indicator of times to come . 
  weetabix rule , that much is true . 
  we also have some prepared to shout a `` cead m\u00edle failte ! '', 
  to the imf , 
   sure there 's much to improve in the portuguese school system , but i ca n't take this article seriously . 
  there is a saying that roughly translates into `` when a man is down , even the dogs piss on him '' . 
  the present economic situation has given full liberty for this sort of articles , which more or less reflect deeper issues in europe in terms of how different zones of europe see each other . 
  the recent ft article suggesting that `` portugal should be annexed by brazil '' is another one in the same vein , for example . 
  some remarks . 
  i might come up as someone who is `` defending the government '' or whatever , but in reality i just want to add some context to a text that although perhaps a bit to melodramatic here and there is generally correct . 
   it is also the least educated , and that has emerged as a painful liability in its gathering economic crisis . 
  true , but this is in large part due to the older population , since pre-1975 education was seen more as a liability than an asset . 
  so much so that :  employers , she says , `` are asking for higher education . '', 
  ... unemployed is also rampant in those with higher education , and one of the most debated topics is the amount of university educated people who do not find a job . 
  this has an impact in drop-out rates . 
  ( note : i 'm commenting as i go , so they do mention this latter in the article )  portugal must generate enough long-term economic growth to pay off its large debts . 
  an unskilled work force makes that hard . 
  agreed ,  cheap rote labor that once sustained portugal 's textile industry has vanished to asia . 
  also agreed . 
  however i note that ( perhaps other ) editors in the wsj are generally quite supportive of the `` they need to make the labour laws more flexible , the problem is that they have unemployment benefits/minimum wage/etc '' . 
  which goes completely * against * the idea that the issue is with education . 
   better schooling in portugal wo n't come quickly the latest [ pisa ] ( http://www.pisa.oecd.org/pages/0,2987,en_32252351_32235731_1_1_1_1_1,00.html ) study actually comewhat contradicts this , with portugal being one of the countries which has improved the most , especially in mathematics . 
  this could be because there was a lot of room for improvement , but the final score is higher than several other western european countries . 
  this is likely what they mean by :  results last year show students improving on standardized tests . 
  there was an intense debate about this because there were several unpopular reforms in the education system , by an unpopular minister which had to leave due to public pressure ( mostly teachers , etc. 
  ) , and the results were seen ad vindicating the decisions made . 
   dropout rates are high . 
  schools struggle to accommodate an influx of immigrants from portugal 's former colonies in africa , such as angola and guinea-bissau . 
  this is a real problem in several different ways . 
  it should be noted , however , that i doubt that it makes a huge impact on the final numbers . 
  now , what i find the most interesting is what i said previously regarding labour laws : everyone seems to talk a lot about education , how it 's great and will help a lot , how the future is in highly skilled jobs , etc , etc.
