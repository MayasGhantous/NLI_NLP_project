sounds like the us .

  it just means we 're better , obviously . 
  spain is younger than portugal , you dolt . 
  very unlikely . 
  as a recently `` gay married '' guy , i 've had to have my `` gay marriage certificate '' translated into english by hand , and authenticated separately ( i.e. 
  30 more euros , and not more because we did n't hire a professional translator ) , because the standard international forms only come in `` straight marriage certificate '' form . 
  so i 'd like for the international scene to grow up and get over it . 
  but it 's unlikely . 
  people like having someone to hate , someone to point to and say * at least that 's not me !, 
  * it 'll take a long-ass while before homosexuality is completely depoliticized . 
  we 're super cute , that 's why !, 
  or , quickly unravelling . 
  he got a ( presumably good ) job in sweden . 
  how could he be angry ? 
  the point in dividing the transfer by gdp per capita is to show the number of contributors that the eu spending costs . 
  how about gdp per capita ? 
  [ ceta is zombie acta . 
  ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ceta-replicates-acta ) to be fair , that eff post is from october . 
  perhaps ceta is n't still zombie acta ... but it might be . 
  that will never happen . 
  very little information on portugal . 
   just your fascistic desire to impose your preference on others . 
  did you read what i wrote ? 
  i said that it would be fine to have multiple versions of birth certificates , as long as they are accurate . 
   why do you get to impose your preferred appellation on them ? 
  what is your magical solution that imposes no appellation on anyone ? 
   this is just an assertion by you . 
  there 's absolutely no need to stop heterosexual couples declaring themselves ` mother ' and ` father ' except for weird misguided notion that if they were allowed to describe themselves that way then gay parents would somehow be less . 
  so you prevent that by making a pretence in legally recognised official forms . 
  heterosexual couples can still define themselves as `` mother '' and `` father '' . 
  the issue is that , in the legal framework of family law , you have to handle all cases equally , or else there will be discrimination . 
  so in the legal sense , we are all parents . 
  the name that shows up on the pre-printed administrative forms is a minor concern . 
  as a genderqueer gay ( biological ) male , i prefer `` parent '' . 
  i 'm sure many straight couples prefer `` mother '' and `` father '' . 
  i 'm sure many gay couples prefer `` father '' and `` father '' or `` mother '' and `` mother '' . 
  but when it comes down to it , this just is n't very important . 
  but as for birth certificates , it _ is _ important that they be accurate . 
  the easiest solution there is to just have it say `` parent '' . 
  another way would be to have three different forms , with the three different `` mother '' and `` father '' combinations . 
  if the birth certificates are n't accurate , the child is the one who is harmed . 
  this is n't about marriage . 
  yes . 
  unfortunately i do n't know what word to use or how to phrase what i actually mean , which is to say , that the sentences being talked about are very weak , or something like that . 
  it 's that the sentences are very weak . 
  i know . 
  but it 's irrelevant to the point i 'm making . 
  you 're saying that she is n't an authority . 
  unless you meant your comment to be irrelevant , the point of your comment is to say that her argument is not respectable or not that good because she is not an authority . 
  i 'm pointing out that her argument does n't rest on her authority or reputation in any way , so your point is invalid . 
  if you want to devalue or disprove her argument , you have to attack her argument , not her person . 
  zinnia jones is n't making an argument from authority . 
  she 's using reason . 
  [ zinnia jones already defused your argument , ] ( http://zinniajones.com/blog/transcripts/the-non-paradox-of-tolerance/ ) in the context of tolerance vs. intolerance . 
  basically , if our goal is to get rid of fascism , we must be intolerant towards fascists . 
  we must strip them of their power . 
  here , it 's not even on the same level . 
  abuse of power is a crime in every free country . 
  if the cop was reported , then he was investigated -- plain and simple . 
  that is not what i mean . 
  a gay person is someone that has affections for people of the same gender -- exclusively or almost exclusively . 
  the reasons why calling it `` gay marriage '' is incorrect are : - it excludes the possibility that one or both partners may not be gay ( they may be bi , or anything ) , - it excludes the possibility that they are an opposite gender couple , but both partners share the same legal sex ( for example , one partner may be a transsexual who has yet to change their legal sex , or is unable to do so due to the huge legal obstacles ) , - it excludes the possibility that one or both partners may be genderqueer , - the marriage does n't have a sexual orientation -- the people in it do . 
  i realize this is nitpicky . 
  but it is simply more correct to say same-sex marriage , since that 's what 's at stake , not gay marriage . 
  there are jurisdictions ( e.g. 
  most states in the usa ) where a few gay couples can get married despite there not being same-sex marriage , because their legal sex need not match their gender . 
  all gay couples are same-sex , but not all same-sex couples are gay . 
  do you understand ? 
  * same-sex marriage . 
  asexuals ? 
  it 's even better if you do suck cocks . 
  thank you . 
  well , there 's gon na be a 3rd vs 4th match , right ? 
  or is that only for the world cup ? 
  i was using the english `` rude '' in both cases . 
  but no one goes around saying `` rude '' in portuguese , especially as it seems to be pretty `` queque '' . 
  meanwhile , `` rude '' in english is a perfectly cromulent interjection . 
  when someone says something in a nasty way , you can just say `` rude '' . 
  that does n't work in portuguese . 
  do you always attack people when you talk to them ? 
  or just people on the internet ? 
  or just people you do n't think are portuguese enough ? 
  or just me ? 
  what 's the deal ? 
  my question * began * the discussion . 
  i wanted to know what you meant by banana republic . 
  if i was n't sure what you meant , then i 'm certainly not the only person who was n't sure . 
  all words used by all people have a personal meaning that is separate from the general meaning of that word , though the meaning need not be different . 
  i do n't think your answer to my question was without value , i think your first reply to my question was without value . 
  your actual answer ( which was contained in your second and third replies ) was valuable . 
  anyway , this discussion has passed and i 'm afraid that neither of us is contributing anything of value at this point . 
  maybe they just feel like some of your comments are n't contributing to the discussion . 
  i know one comment of yours that i think is n't contributing . 
  ( your first reply to me . ), 
  it is n't implied at all . 
  i asked you what you meant . 
  you replied , but apparently you meant a lot more than what you replied with . 
  that 's annoying .
