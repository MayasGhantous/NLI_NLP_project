  this article definitely said a whole lot of nothing . 
  so there 's some hijab stores with links to salafis ... and ? 
  to me it 's just another in a pattern of articles i 've been seeing the last 1-2 years that seems to try and take responsibility away from young muslims interested in jihad by creating boogymans that are running around ` brainwashing ' people to become extreme . 
  the reality is that the vast majority of these young people are actively seeking extremist media and contacts on their own well before they encounter a jihadi in person . 
  it reminds me of the old propagandas on drug use where a 15 year old who never tried drugs walks down a dark alley and some guy gives him heroin and he is addicted 1 week later . 
  it does n't happen like this in reality . 
  mate like it or not , a sex tape / nude leak can fuck up your career or social life quite a lot , even many years later . 
  you can talk about how things should be , but you should still recognize how things currently are . 
  thats really cool , i did n't even know there was portuguese missionaries in viet and i 'm a bit of a history nerd . 
  crazy how languages get effected by far away cultures like this . 
  yeah i know i just thught something like gathering or festival made more sense in english with the context . 
  maybe ` marketplace ' would be better ? 
  in english if i hear 1st 2nd 3rd market it sounds like specific physical locations . 
  i 'm usually a very proud guy but our system for days is fucking stupid . 
  2nd-6th ~ ~ ` festival ' ~ ~ market for mon-fri really ? 
  i 'm surprised we never adapted to spanish or some other style . 
  is this even possibly true ? 
  i 'm sure they scam but $ 500 ? 
  i would immediately tell him to fuck off and call the police if he made a problem with it . 
  at no point did he say it was immigrants fault . 
  the ` democratic system ' is n't the issue in most of the arabian peninsula . 
  if you give them full open democracy they will still mostly vote for islamists . 
  you 'll end up with something like iran in almost every country not named lebanon . 
  then probably get civil war if the country has sizable shia or christian populations ( e , g syria , yemen ) . 
  it 's almost a miracle egypt is as paceful as it already is . 
  i think you 're misunderstanding . 
  in countries with higher corruption making tons of these municipalities and offices makes it easier to launder/funnel tax money around in shady ways . 
  we have these things happen in portugal too , but i 'm sure it 's worse in balkans . 
  with so many municipalities it becomes more difficult to have oversight . 
  so you get more of a politician giving a 8 million contract to his brother in law 's construction firm for a 2 million job . 
  then the brother in law builds the politician a new house for 20 % of the normal cost ( using money gained from ridiciulous contract ) because they are family and why not !, 
  things like this . 
  no , you 're right . 
  this is sort of the nyt 's schtick . 
  it 's a fairly controversial paper in the u.s. 
  the nyt is effectively the unofficial mouthpiece for the american jewish left , the american haaretz more or less . 
  it 's quite crass but if you 're in nyc even for a short amount of time you 'll hear people openly refer to the paper as the ` jew york times ' . 
  edit : [ i found their response to vall 's response ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/europe/manuel-valls-new-york-times-musulmanes.html?ref=europe ) kind of laughable . 
  ` we polled 1400 people ' and you decided quoting a woman who claims to be ` spat on daily ' was the most reasonable to publish ? 
  iglesias from watching a pablo iglesias ( from podemos ) ` debate ' , and carillo from the colombian general in narcos series i just used first 2 spanish names that came to mind cause original guy was spanish and i 'm a goof, 
  [ some really intense ` mirin ] ( https://youtu.be/gtyez4dzouk?t=231 ) more on topic , i ca n't tell if this is legit or just an advertisement . 
  the intense polyglots who speak 12 + languages seem so unbelievable to me that i 'm a big cynic . 
  i suppose they are just a personality type who is really good at memorizing patterns for conjugations and stuff and intentionally keep somewhat limited vocabularies ? 
   `` blasts '' , `` slams '' . 
  glad i 'm not alone . 
  that shit triggers me to no end . 
  two politicians have a polite disagreement --  `` iglesias slams carillo on new tax policy '', 
  can someone explain to me when the uk and us ` left ' went from wanting warm relations with russia to becoming outright publicly hostile and why ? 
  maybe i 'm just imagining it ? 
  it 's a very pro-israel anti-palestina paper not sure if you 're being intentionally obtuse or what, 
  it will be sustainable , but not with the same quality of life . 
  i 'm no expert and would love to be wrong but if demographic trends continue i suspect many eu countries will look a lot more like brazil or peru ( e , g , a 10 % or less ` elite ' class of people living in gated communities and sending their kids to private schools while paying very high tax that subsidize a poverty cycle in large ghettos ) . 
  i think [ this map ] ( http://rethinkingvis.com/media/viz/brazil_racial_dot_map.png ) in the context of [ this map ] ( http://freedomandprosperity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/brazil-dependency-election.jpg ) wo n't surprise many people . 
  that the richest , safest and whitest state is also the one voting for the hard socialist party in contrast to states with more working class whites probably has some parallels in eu politics ... 
  i sincerely do n't mean to come off snarky or rude here , but are you aware of the reputation of the new york times in america ? 
  i have maybe a stupid question . 
  do people in ngk have right of access to armenia and azer ? 
  can they just drive to armenia and cross borders freely and safely or are they de facto ` trapped ' . 
  would armenia give citizenship to armenians born in ngk if they moved to armenia ? 
  same also for people in the azer exclave , do they need to drive thru iran to access ` mainland ' azeri by road ? 
  nyc area yeah . 
  i did n't study in nj but someone here asked me about a portuguese restaurant there iirc . 
  my only experience with nj was mostly the turnpike on the way to ac or philly . 
  i give a + to taylor ham sandwich though , i should open them in portugal and become rich . 
  that was my retarded comment of the day , lol ty . 
  i will pretend like norway does n't want to join eu out of snus protest . 
  i 'm glad i do n't live in scandi-land , when i was living in the us i was a complete snus addict for 6 months and probably only kicked the habit because i ca n't buy it and could never smoke, 
  what about norway ? 
  i thought snus was moderately popular there as well . 
  well , i visited london as a tourist and saw dozens ( many outside of the grosvenor vic casino of all places ) . 
  no idea if my experience was abnormal but i got the sense that if you live in london you see burkas often . 
  even british who do n't live in london probably visit from time to time . 
  are you 15 ? 
  these talks about basic income are actually of interest to me , because i suspect 100 + years down the road technology and automation will reach a point where 80 % + of the population wo n't be able to find meaningful employment regardless of skillset and motivation . 
  we 're already looking at losing a huge % of general workforce in lorry drivers and shipping if self-driving cars and drones continue to improve . 
  no i want the guy trying to smash a completely unagressive cop with a metal pole to get shot, 
  if i had a superpower to time travel and teleport other people i would 100 % teleport 2 american cops into that car jesus christ, 
   since judaism is a religion , not a race . 
  this is maybe pedantic but jews have such a long history of marrying within themselves that there is definitely ` jewish ' races . 
  jews themselves differentiate between sephardi , mizrahi , ashkenazi etc. 
  and for the most part view them as ` races ' to some extent . 
  why do so many euro countries seem to define ` diversity ' as ` the native population ca n't be a majority ' ? 
  it 's insane , no other region thinks like this . 
  the very idea of imagining koreans debating why they do n't have more foreign people in their politics is so absurd that it 's hard to even consider it . 
  why would 30 % of a population say they have a favorable population of christians but only 2 % of the same population say they have a favorable view of jews ? 
  this is n't exactly a controversial topic , it 's even widely discussed in academia - even in mena countries . 
  lol [ ok ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/07/21/muslim-western-tensions-persist/ ) . 
  see the 4th table . 
  the following countries had < 5 % respondents saying they had a favorable view of jews : - turkey - egypt - jordan - palestine - pakistan there 's absolutely no reason to think other arab countries are significantly different , but since you seem reality-adverse i 'm sure you can rationalize something . 
  it 's not a generalization . 
  i speak arabic . 
  anti-semitism is absolutely a defining feature of muslim arab culture and anyone trying to deny it is categorically dishonest . 
  your ` friend ' is the exception , not the rule , and if he speaks arabic at all he already knows it , all he has to do is log onto arabic language internet sites . 
  i suspect it 's the muslim community in general . 
  [ here 's the malaysian pm speaking at a conference of islamic countries and explaining how jews control the economy and ` invented ' socialism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36c1ptaya2u ) . 
  this was the prime minister of a major asian muslim country . 
  his speech was met with applause . 
  it 's impossible . 
  look at religious dress for example of amish communities in us or [ mennonite ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/be/8e/f8/be8ef86055ef573380162c1fc949216a.jpg ) in south america . 
  100 % of these women will tell you they choose to dress this way , and for many it will also be true .
