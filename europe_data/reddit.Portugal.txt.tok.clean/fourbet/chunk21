  no wey , real man in polski only drink liquor ( yes , wine is fine ), 
  prepare for bad beer ( compared to mex ) and good liquor . 
  i hope you like to drink . 
  i still think for scenery madeira is probably best , but maybe it does n't count idk . 
  it 's common for jihadis to think that shia are crypto-zoroastrian or crypto-jews ` faking it ' , thus the insult that all shia are secretly zoroastrian/polytheist . 
  yeah it 's pretty standard jihadi vocab to refer to any shia as one of ` persians ' ` rejectors ' ` fire worshippers ' etc. 
  to give more background , before the euro , eder was kind of a ` washed up ' player , mostly a substitue , one of the last picked for the international team etc. 
  casual fans did n't even know he existed . 
  he 's still really mediocre , but after coming in as a sub and scoring a hero goal in the euro he has become a national meme all over portuguese internet and r/portugalcaralho , often referred to in religious terms like lord and saviour , best footballer of all time etc. 
   what would be your solution for the middle east ? 
  try to think that trough . 
  how about the middle east gets to solve middle eastern problems and not us ? 
  why are you so paternalistic toward other people ? 
  i want the actual estimate of dead germans required for you to not feel compelled toward shaming them for being angered . 
  20k , 500k ? 
  lets put a number on it . 
  it appears muslims are accepted to be angry due to meddling in their countries , so there must have been a number that made this acceptable . 
  how many europeans need to die so that we can make equal excuses for who has justifiable anger . 
  how many innocent people need to die before you accept anger as a reasonable response . 
  can you put a rough estimate on it ? 
  try reading the article you comment on . 
  she 's obviously more loyal to her ethnic group than denmark . 
  maybe she did n't pay attention in the multiculturalism classes . 
   that stems from moving to a country that speaks and entirely different language with usually no relatives or acquintances and has completely different customs just to improve their lives . 
  glad we agree they can stop moving to europe if it encourages them to go jihad . 
  yes , we should be nice to terrorists or they might become more extreme . 
  also , we should stop investigating mafias , it will only make impressionable youth more likely to join the mafia . 
  we should appease them until they become peaceful . 
  it will be worse most likely . 
  vote for frauke and stop importing people who hate you . 
  let 's see if the upper middle class berlinners learn what their mates in the east have been warning them about for the last 4-5 years now ( they wo n't ), 
   from the rest of the world . 
  i think you mean mena and pakistan . 
  wake me up next time a korean does a suicide attack in pest . 
  isis believes their sole purpose in life should be to establish a global caliphate . 
  winning or losing is irrelevant to the goal , it 's their religious duty to give it 100 % . 
  westerners like to pretend there is some other advanced methodology because they project their own quasi-religious lifestyles onto these people , but you need to understand that 99 % of jihadis are ** true believers ** . 
  or maybe the native populations and their culture is what made them prosperous ? 
  portugal 's most richest time in recent history was during estado novo , and it did n't have a lot of liberal democracy involved . 
  the bigger the muslim population gets in europe the more these things will happen . 
  there 's literally no logical reason to presume otherwise . 
  it should n't matter , but the fact that a guy with 3 children could do something like this makes me more upset because i ca n't help but presume he probably is violent with them as well . 
  ca n't speak for everywhere , but here gypsies often take portuguese or spanish names . 
  i saw this on portuguese media yesterday and thought it was just some stupid kid messing with a chemistry set or something blown out of proportion . 
  12 years old ? 
  if this report is accurate his parents and every adult in his life needs to be investigated immediately . 
  diversity of thought is what makes europe great . 
  outside of your social circle i 'm sure there are many people who think quite differently than you about these things . 
  saying it makes someone a ` trump supporter ' or implying they are n't dutch because of it is quite insidious and you should feel ashamed of yourself . 
  could n't 1,100 be very close to ` natural ' applications otherwise . 
  does n't really seem to be indicative of anything other than a small % of every countries people seek employment/life abroad . 
  i 'm not czech so hopefully someone can correct me if wrong , but when i 've been there i was gambling in a ` private club ' that was basically a small casino . 
  you had to pay like 20 czech crowns to ` join the club ' and enter . 
  presuming it 's possible to do this for casinos , it 's probably very possible to do for smoking . 
  i 'm no russia fanboy but it 's the same with the monthly news snippets about ` russia forces on east ukraine border ' . 
  yeah , it 's a major population center and there is military bases there , so they move people in and out . 
  it would be like articles that canadian army is close to us border every month . 
  i understand they wan na keep people in touch with the donetsk conflict but it 's intentionally misleading and they never mentions that those army bases have had troops there for decades . 
  i 'm not a zealous hater , but the second half ushered in what was effectively a long slow 400 year war . 
  guess it depends on what angle you want to look at it all from . 
  the first half of 600-900 was cool , the second half not so much . 
   impersonating a minor should also be added to the list . 
  amen, 
  ` dont admit youre american or people will hate you ' , not exact quote but something like that . 
   i personally do n't get the gypsy hate . 
  99 % of gypsies i encounter here send their children to steal near cash machines or beg outside mcdonalds . 
  even most of our scummiest indigenous criminals do n't involve their children to that extent . 
  these gypsies are by far the most ` visible ' in our society , so it paints most peoples ' opinion . 
  well it 's 90 % muslim so they obviously do n't hate themselves . 
  yeah do n't do that in south portugal or we 'll think you 're a pansy and dishonest . 
  not every part of europe likes to jack off at how enlightened and anti-330 million people we are . 
  i always find it funny when people call the uk most racist and then try to reconcile it with the fact that it 's * still * the # 1 destination for poles and south asian muslims by an extremely high margin . 
  also the 2nd highest destination for oversea immigrating africans , after the us , which is also another funny conflict of narrative . 
  wow , incredibly bad hit piece . 
  yes , russia 's aircraft carrier is n't on par with french or us ones . 
  just about everything else in the article is hyperbole or outright lies . 
  i 'm so triggered i 'll make a list :  first , there is no military purpose : the carrier was designed to protect home waters , not for strike missions true it was n't designed for ` strike missions ' to some extent , but that does n't mean its ineffectual there . 
  furthermore , russia started using the carrier because they had issues with jihadis and sympathizers tipping off people in other parts of the country when russian jets took off from the various airfields . 
  the carrier strikes are a lot harder for jihadis to prepare for as civilians ca n't watch them take off from their backyard . 
   its distinctive `` ski jump '' prow is an admission of technological defeat -- because the deck lacks the catapults found on u.s. carriers , jets need the extra boost of the ramp to avoid toppling into the ocean . 
  the ` ski jump ' is n't really some ancient terrible technology . 
  spain , india and i 'm pretty sure most countries employ this method compared to the u.s. ships slingshot method . 
  i 'm 99 % sure uk 's ** brand new ** carrier also has it . 
   according to the trade website the aviationist , on saturday an su-33 flanker returning to the carrier crashed into the sea after failing to hook onto the deck-top `` arrestor cables '' that slow the jets upon landing . 
  this is n't evidence of bad tech , there 's literally about a dozen vids of this happening to top of the line us ships as well . 
  these things happen , albeit rarely . 
  none of that is evangelical . 
  it 's a real term and has an actual meaning other than what you 're saying . 
  some super lefty friend of mine , who is an ultra greenwald fan and was all aboard the ` fake news elected trump ' train , had an existential crisis when he read this article calling out his favorite papers lol . 
  i always am a bit envious of people who find these ancient things . 
  if reincarnation is real i hope i get to be an archaeologist in my restart , but hopefully without all that study and stuff - just digging and finding old statues and manuscripts . 
  i hate these false comparisons . 
  poland was also once europe 's premier muslim killers too . 
  poland owes it to us to march winged hussars into latakia and free the holy land right ? 
  if lithuanians were n't a bit selfish they 'd be an oblast and your state media would be in russian . 
  ah so there is exemption for lower income and it 's a static amount . 
  so for example a poor guy maybe only pays 100 of the 5000 , but a rich guy pays 5000 of the 5000 ? 
  interesting thks, 
  well what works for them is clearly that their diet is radically different . 
  i 'm not even sure eu fishing could sustain the amount of seafood needed if everyone was magically forced to adopt a japanese style diet .
