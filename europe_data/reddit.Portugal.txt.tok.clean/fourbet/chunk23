  this is literally a global thing . 
  this data just shows who lies more to surveyors . 
  edit : respect to indians for keeping honesty a viture lol . 
  well to give more background ... 
  this girl was captured a week ago , and iraqi army could n't get her to talk . 
  at first they thought she was russian ( chechen ) cause she could n't speak arabic , then they brought in a russian translator and realized she did n't speak russian . 
  so they put her photos on arab social media / twitter trying to identify her because they thought maybe she was a yezidi or slave girl who somehow did n't know arabic . 
  so , this was actually a big story ( random girl found in isis bunker w/a gun who does n't speak arabic and is very young ... ) in arabic media prior to her getting id 'd as well . 
  got ta really take it on a case by case basis . 
  they allegedly caught this girl holed up in a sniper perch shooting at people . 
  she 's most likely killed directly herself and without question has aided other killers . 
  algeria vs morocco is the most interesting one for me on this map . 
  i wonder if there 's any explanation . 
   which kind of stereotypes exist in your country about argentina ? 
  white , corrupt ( government ) , somewhat rude in comparison to other south americans , pleasant accent , really love chocolate for some reason , proud , confident , anti-american for seemingly no reason , boludos , psychically attractive , either very intelligent or very stupid . 
  that sums up most of them . 
  i live in a very tourist-y area of portugal for reference . 
   which continental model do you use in your schools ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand this question  how do you see americans nowadays ? 
  portugal usually polls quite highly on opinion of america , usually only 2nd or 3rd behind poland . 
  this is accurate in my personal experience as well . 
  most people range from indifferent to very positive . 
  ( fwiw i live in a very touristy area , algarve , and american tourists are usually among the favorites due to being a nice mix of generous , polite , and curious ) . 
   what folkloric songs do you recommend of your countries ? 
  the most popular would probably be the fado , i think [ am\u00e1lia rodrigues is the most famous ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yrivm8sc7m ) . 
  my parents were big fans of the `` celtic '' folk songs , stuff [ like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toizigbubxc ) or [ brigada victor jara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ewpjehanmu ) . 
  we also used to listen to a lot of galician folk music , such as [ fuxan os ventos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzdqv7mxq9a ) . 
  a lot of the celtic influenced folk music comes from northern portugal and galicia , i 'm really not sure how traditional it is ...  what is the most controversial thing that you know about argentina ? 
   what is your opinion about separatist movements in some european countries ( like catalonia , scotland , kosovo , and so on ) ? 
  unless galicia has one i wo n't care about it . 
  i think in portugal in general people are mostly somewhat sympathetic to them , since a lot of portuguese have a `` underdog '' mentality . 
  older people often were supporters of irish unification for religious reasons too i think . 
   what is your position with the problem of greece-republic of macedonia ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm very sympathetic to the greek perspective . 
  it 's silly to name a country after a historic region of greece , particularly when there is a greek province with the same name below you . 
  that said , it can be a bit silly at times . 
   what is your favorite football team in south america and why ? 
  i just liked their kit in early fifa games . 
  i had a river plate kit when i was a kid that my father bought , so i support them . 
  he was a huge fan of enzo francescoli , and that 's part of the reason i know who igancio copani is . 
  when i went to uruguay on holiday i was informed that nacional was something like a sister club to river , so if i ever somehow get uruguayan football on tv i 'll support them too . 
  having their own times of war and peace , like everyone else . 
   `` he was looking for foreigners and he did n't want any egyptians , '' said one member of staff at the zahabia hotel . 
  it also appears he was targeting women , at least all the described victims have been women . 
  i wonder what his motive could have been , making an attack like this by the beach . 
   this is especially noticeable when i come back from the us to visit family . 
  like i do n't know what 's up with the local guys , they are so rude and harbor zero empathy towards other people . 
  could you maybe explain this more ? 
  i 've also lived in the u.s. so i 'm just curious , if it 's too personal and you 'd rather not np . 
  i dislike nothing about our beautiful country . 
  if i had to describe two annoyances though , they would be : - our drug policy is often championed as ideal , but there is a lot of `` enabling '' of junkies and i 'm not convinced it 's the best system . 
  our addicts may not suffer in prison but i think there is little incentive for them to change their habits and sometimes it makes me sad ( disclaimer : i live in an area of southern portugal with a lot of heroin addicts ) . 
  it 's a complicated problem of course , i just get annoyed when people act like it 's a perfect system and all other countries should try it . 
  i genuinely think something like a prison with a focus on slowly working the addicts off drugs ( talking serious drugs like heroin here ) is probably the ideal , but i 'm not aware of many countries trying this type of mix . 
  our junkies maybe do n't commit as much crime or steal as much , but many of them are basically going to be permanently in a shelter or homeless and not productive until they eventually die . 
  i 'm just not sure this is best . 
  - leaving portugal has almost become a status symbol for young people , and although i do n't blame them , it hurts my ( our ? ), 
  out of the people my age i grew up with , i think as many as 15 % or more have left ( mostly for france and uk ) , and i do n't think they 'll be coming back . 
  that 's ok , but it being `` cool '' to leave a bad situation instead of staying to improve it is something that i think might be cultural to portuguese and sometimes bothers me . 
  two pretty controversial ones probably from me , interested what others think . 
  i 'm probably one of the most sympathetic to russia who regularly contributes to this sub , but i just do n't care . 
  history shows us that poles will be the victim of aggression , and they are making the correct ( imo ) decisions to secure their people . 
  many of us in europe can feel a level of safety those in the central and east regions do not have the luxury to feel . 
  even if us is not sincere ( which i 'm not convinced is 100 % true ) these poles should be admired for protecting their country and culture . 
  this has always been a thing , but i think social media penetration makes it worse . 
  20 years ago if you offended someone they can only really tell a few people who may or may not care . 
  now , you can shout it out and even direct it to an audience who one can preselect to care . 
  also , and maybe more controversially , but there have been a few incidents of controversial commentary in recent past that were met with huge response . 
  one example that comes to mind is the greek olympic triple jumper ( i think ) who was banned from the olympics for making a joke like ` it 's good we 're having the olympics in greece , the mosquitos will have home-made food ' ( a reference to west nile virus ) . 
  this got her banned from the olympics . 
  i just do n't see that resulting in a ban even 15 years ago , and it definitely has a muting effect on even less controversial statements . 
  in the early stages if the isis rise ( 2011-2014ish ) they were all over twitter . 
  it was actually shocking to me how long it was before twitter cracked down . 
  anyways , at the height of is power i think a lot of these guys were really confident that their ` state ' would succeed , and they would post lots of pictures about the life in the caliphate to encourage others to leave europe and join . 
  in most cases these guys pretty much self-doxxed their involvement . 
   americans are muh freedoms and cult of personality these are n't the people responsible for high gun crime rates in the us , not even close . 
  [ whites commit 5.8 % of gun crime in nyc for example ] ( http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/year_end_2015_enforcement_report.pdf ) . 
  they are ~ 50 % of the population . 
  you figure the rest out . 
   even the poorest , most corrupt , mafia ridden eu member states tend to have lower violent crime than the most white , prosperous , rural us state this is demonstrably false . 
  the state with the lowest murder rate ( new hampshire ) also has one of the highest gun ownership rates . 
  ** us states with high gun ownership/low murderrate ** - new hampshire : 1.10 per 100k - vermont : 1.60 per 100k ( 2015 number skewed high because of first murder in  a decade ) - maine : 1.7 per 100k - utah : 1.8 per 100k ** eastern europe ** - albania : 2.28 per 100k - montenegro : 2.7 per 100k - ukraine : 4.36 per 100k - belarus : 3.58 per 100k - latvia : 4.11 per 100k - estonia : 3.22 per 100k note that nh specifically does n't even require someone to get a concealed carry permit . 
  [ country source , via un crime survey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) [ us state source , via fbi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_in_the_united_states_by_state ), 
  just an anecdote based off my personal feelings , but i think it 's a combination of some things : - we take a lot of pride in our military compared to the european average . 
  especially our sailors . 
  - maybe a stretch , but accounting for our islands we 're quite geographically close to the us , relatively speaking . 
  - we historically are faithful and honorable allies , even when our allies are ocassionally big jerks like spain and albion . 
  - lastly , like he said , portuguese general opinion of the us is fairly positive and most view this as effectively an alliance with the us above all . 
  i doubt it 's an obsession , and if you moved to america your grandkids would still retain a lot of swedish identity because you 'd import a lot of it into your kids whether conciously or not . 
  furthermore , in every multicultural country whether the us or brasil inter-racial/cultural marriage is about as common as homosexuality , which is to say not very common . 
  lastly , it 's a bit removed now but in the past most americans would meet/form social groups in church and as such those from non-protestant backgrounds ( effectively irish , italians , greeks , jews , russians and poles ) tend to be even more identified with their cultural background than northern europeans who were spread more thinly amongst the endless protestant denominations . 
  lastly , do you tell 3rd generation lebanes swedes that referencig their lebanese background is strange if they do n't speak arabic ? 
  if no , why are you a hypocrite about this ? 
  if you get a chance you should flip through one . 
  each page is like a / r/murica post . 
  it 's like , mount rushmore , moon landing photo , huge eagle , some picture of [ indians and cowboys ] ( http://www.spychips.com/blog/images/passport-page-with-johnson-quote.jpg ) . 
  pretty cool actually . 
  nice so integration still does n't occur after multiple generations , that 's so much better . 
  thanks for this optimistic new take on the situation .
