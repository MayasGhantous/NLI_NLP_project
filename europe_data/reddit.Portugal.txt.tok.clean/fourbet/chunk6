  are we so desensitized to the concept that we expect this behaviour now from center and left political groups ? 
  you probably would n't want to read the pro-islam feminist blogs , but [ here 's one of the more popular ones ] ( http://thefatalfeminist.com/ ) . 
  they generally all espouse the idea that `` islam is and was originally feminist but over time got hijacked by men/the patriarchy '' . 
  this blogger , and many others , tend to take the more controversial verses ( most notably [ 4:34 ] ( http://quran.com/4/34 ) ) and claim that the arabic is misinterpreted , which as an arabic speaker is almost always ridiculous . 
  ex : in her blog she says that `` strike her '' referring to how to admonish your wife actually meant something more like `` strike fear '' or `` remind her of her duty to allah '' . 
  [ here 's the specific blog post in question ] ( http://thefatalfeminist.com/2011/02/12/lost-in-translation-violence-against-wives/ ) . 
   and it was also translated correctly here :  4:94 `` o ye who believe !, 
  when ye leave / go abroad ( darabtum ) in the cause of god , investigate carefully ... ''  here darabtum still does not mean `` to beat '' but `` to scourge '' or `` to leave . '' i mean , she 's right in the context that the verse she mentions was `` translated correctly '' . 
  but it 's very similar to the english word `` strike '' which has multiple meanings . 
  if you say `` strike your wife '' and then later say `` the workers went on strike '' it 's obviously a stretch to say you meant in the first example that you actually meant you calmly requested your wife boycott her work . 
  it 's just an insane way to try to cover for the verse ... 
  i do n't know what the term is in english but they basically start with the conclusion and try their best to reframe the evidence so it points to being `` patriarchy '' rather than other more plausible ( imo i guess ) explanations . 
  you pretty much have to reject reality to try and interpret that specific verse in any other way than saying to hit your wife if psychologically abusing her first does n't achieve your goal . 
  my point being , these people really are insane ideologues . 
  burqa and niqab are almost unheard of in iran . 
  even their typical hijab are far less strict than places like malaysia or the middle east ( showing hair is very common ) . 
  not sure where you 're getting the idea iran has similar dress codes to other islamic nations but you 're wrong . 
  yeah , it 's always a bit alarming to see some praising the ` moderate rebels ' and fsa fighting assad in worldnews or other subs . 
  many of those groups are not even trying to hide the fact that they are sunni arab nationalists . 
  once the assyrians are completely displaced from iraq and syria i wonder if it will be labeled a genocide . 
  it 's also mildly depressing that they 're now `` fleeing isis '' to `` find refuge '' in turkey considering at least some of the people in this video are probably descended from families that were forcibly removed from turkey just a century before . 
  i 'm an older guy and i 've been long wondering when this anomaly will be more under the microscope . 
  even in portugal in the 90 's / early 2000 's i believe there was a somewhat large gender gap between males and females in uni , 45/55 or so . 
  in grade school i felt like courses were generally geared more toward women , with an emphasis on `` projects '' like artsy posters and stuff as opposed to real essays and tests . 
  you could make an ugly poster with all the required information and get a lower grade than someone who made a really pretty poster with 4-5 copy and pasted sentences . 
  it always struck me a bit odd , that they were talking even back then about needing more women in uni/science while nearly all the girls in my school were getting excellent marks and intended to go to uni . 
  as a kid i just assumed everyone in my village was a genius or something . 
  can you define fascism for me ? 
  i see a lot of people casually throwing around the fascist label when i suspect they mean nationalist . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  i also think dutch sounds like someone speaking english with a bunch of marbles in their mouth . 
  i also think greek and castillian sound similar . 
  the only real notable difference is i think greek has a lot more hard `` k '' sounds . 
  yeah , perhaps i should mention that there could be other factors . 
  the basic tl ; dr of the study was that `` when we predict we have x # of homeless , and build an extra shelter so we can house them all , suddenly there are y # more homeless and we must again build another shelter '' . 
  it 's of course entirely possible that more homeless developed organically and not as a direct result of building more shelters and food banks , although they did n't skirt around the possibility that making it easier to `` live on the street '' meant more people would be comfortable with it and choose it as a lifestyle over low skill labor jobs . 
  it 's a controversial theory but i read an article recently about it being discussed in vancouver , canada - a place that supposedly has notoriously generous social benefits and homeless assistance programs compared to na in general . 
  i ca n't find the article unfortunately , but vancouver did some in depth tracking/analyzing of the homeless population while they worked to simultaneously increase the amount of shelters and programs . 
  they found that the more they did for the homeless , the more people ( by % ) that became homeless . 
  in essence , the easier it was to be homeless , the more people that would fall into homelessness . 
  the reality is there is probably some sweet spot in the middle which is the ideal assistance to give if you 're not going to have the state completely subsidize housing and go for a basic income type of system . 
  it does appear that being `` too generous '' can actually have a negative impact . 
  i wish i could find the specific article i had read as it was very in depth but if you just google `` vancouver homelessness rising '' or something you 'll find a lot of stuff that touch on the same ideas . 
  maybe someone already said it , but at lower levels and sometimes the pros too if a catcher is a weak thrower or a base runner is particularly fast a common strategy exists when there are runners on both 1st and 3rd base . 
  the guy on first will attempt a steal and if they try to throw him out the guy on third will dash for home since it will require another throw to get there . 
  i was surprised to learn they have an almost ok brazilian baseball team too . 
  but then , if you look at the roster it 's almost 100 % us or japanese dual-citizens . 
  presumably it 's a similar case in some of these european countries . 
  i always found this funny as well . 
  it 's pretty clear those guys were just never very athletic or good at sport and they want to believe the participants and fans of it are ` stupid ' . 
  frankly , there is just as much strategy or whatever in ice hockey as there is in a competitive cs : go match , maybe even more . 
  also similarly , you do n't have to be a rhode scholar to headshot noobs , but you certainly do need a certain type of quick thinking intelligence of a sort to know how/where to position yourself and predict opponents patterns and behaviors . 
  this same applies to all physical sports as well . 
  if the translations are accurate some of the stuff this guy said is so over the top i almost wonder if it 's performance art or something . 
   he lamented that the concentration camps were closed ( `` kzs sind ja leider derzeit au\u00dfer betrieb '' ) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and accused german politicians of being `` gauleiter against their own people '' , called germany a `` shit state '' ( `` schei\u00dfstaat '' ) and female asylum seekers `` fugitive whores '' ( `` fl\u00fcchtende schlampen '' ) . 
  further , according to pirin\u00e7ci , muslims want to `` pump infidels full of their muslim juice '' ( `` ungl\u00e4ubige mit ihrem moslemsaft vollpumpen '' ) and germany awaits a `` muslim garbage dump '' ( `` moslemm\u00fcllhalde '' ) . 
  he called the german green party a `` party of child fuckers '' ( `` kinderfickerpartei '' ) , and the spokesperson for the mosque in erfurt a `` muslim freak with a taliban beard '' ( `` moslemfritzen mit talibanbart '' ) , who had as much to do with german culture as `` my asshole with the production of perfume '' ( `` wie mein arschloch mit parf\u00fcmherstellung '' ) . 
  [ 4 ] solid burn on that last one though !, 
  i always felt like the assassinations of van gogh and fortuyn made dutch people a bit more willing to talk about these things with less fear of appearing ` right wing ' . 
  perhaps i 'm projecting as well . 
  i 'm curious about the timing of this . 
  `` late thursday '' could mean it took a bit for the news to pick it up and it happened at 6pm , or it could be another way of saying friday 3am . 
  a group of migrants rushing the border in the middle of the night could definitely be a bit frightening with a lack of vision and all . 
  are you aware of the birth rate for `` ethnic germans '' compared to migrants ? 
  people are n't having kids . 
  [ this stuff has been in the news sporadically for quite awhile ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/germany-birthrate-low-falling ) . 
  comparatively , migrant families allegedly have much higher birthrates . 
  so if you do some math wizardry and presume rates will stay similar you get a result of `` ethnic germans '' being a minority at some point in the future . 
  things could of course change , but personally i think the birth rate will continue to go down before it goes up . 
  even in portugal , when i encounter someone who has a child and is < 30 i 'm mildly surprised . 
  it 's * possible * to have 3-5 kids if you start at 30 , but it 's not particularly likely , easy nor safe in my opinion . 
  modern left is the new religion . 
  you are born with original sin via skin colour and must become a true disciple of progressivism to shed yourself of that sin . 
  you should n't necessarily be ashamed but marriage is theoretically a promise to never split up . 
  you 're certainly right , but as an outsider a lot of what you read regarding sweden makes it sound completely fucked . 
  it leaves one to consider two possibilities : 1 - sweden is fucked 2 - there is a general media campaign to make sweden appear fucked they 're both kind of sad possibilities , but it 's hard to find a reason for 2 to be the case . 
  i 've said it here before but there are two major benefits if you 're looking at it from a more `` dark '' angle 1 ) you 're effectively importing voters for your party . 
  you can presume that since most migrants want to go there they will then continue to support the political party that helped them get there . 
  even if they ca n't vote it 's likely a fair % of them would actively campaign/protest on your behalf . 
  2 ) driving down low-skill labor wages has a multi-part benefit . 
  beyond directly economically benefitting oligarchs who own staffing agencies and small government jobs such as people who clean the tubes etc , it also is likely to increase the % of the population who are completely dependent on the government . 
  when you rely on certain government programs to live day to day it 's significantly more likely you 'll vote for the parties that campaign on a platform of continuing/improving said programs . 
  maybe . 
  it 's worth noting that numerous regions of italy were ruled or administered by spanish/aragon kings during that time . 
  the idea of nation-states was n't quite as well established in those times so nationality was a bit more fluid . 
  at one time the king of spain was technically an austrian noble who 's mother language was dutch and spent almost none of his life in austria . 
  europe is weird sometimes . 
  a lot of n/s americans have this bizarre desire to define exactly what is a ` latino ' and a general confusion as to the identity . 
  it 's difficult to explain maybe . 
  i think particularly in america because most white/euro ancestry people there have mostly combined and adopted a universal language they expect all spanish speaking people to be similarly culturally ` merged ' . 
  one of the more annoying aspects of my study in the us was the prevailing concept that all people speaking castellano are unified under this banner of ` latino ' and form some kind of community . 
  more than a few times i had to explain to people that i did not consider myself latino , and that yes i 'm actually european . 
  also had to say a few times ` no , asshole , we are not the canada of spain ' , although that one did make me laugh . 
  the idea that low birth rates are some armageddon status problem is ridiculous to begin with . 
  people have been talking about japanese society collapsing for decades now because of low birth rates . 
  they just invented more robots and worked around it as much as possible . 
  people may not have as cushy retirements in 50 years as they had no , but it 's hardly some looming disaster that we must rapidly alleviate . 
  the same people saying immigration is needed to fix the population probably also think the world is overpopulated and want to reduce carbon emissions . 
  i highly doubt europe wo n't be able to handle lower populations across the board , if anything it 's been overdue . 
  there is two major gains from mass immigration : - a larger % of the population literally dependent on the state - drives down low skill labor wages so companies who employ en masse have higher profit margins - lastly , if you can get enough % of these people dependent on the state , they will tend to dutifully vote for your party .
