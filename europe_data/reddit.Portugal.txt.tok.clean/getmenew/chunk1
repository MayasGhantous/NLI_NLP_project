some will steal or scam to survive . 
  some ? 
  yeah , sorry for the free education , tax exemption , housing and state monetary aids . 
  they also have arranged marriages in portugal . 
  so we are drafting a bill prohibiting arranged marriages . 
  now the portuguese gypsy federation ( this is a thing ) says that they do n't do arranged marriages [ ** but ** ] ( https://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsf.pt%2fpaginainicial%2fportugal%2finterior.aspx%3fcontent_id%3d4190205%26page%3d-1&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) say they are being prosecuted by this law . 
  all of europe does ... right guys ? 
  well , agreed . 
   quiet spanish village near the sea . 
  the brits have ruinned them all . 
  come to portugal , something in the western coast . 
  i 'm not biased at all . 
  for similar service . 
  our taxis are n't that bad imo . 
  just a lot of circle jerk going around . 
  in portugal it 's actually more expensive . 
  in lisbon yes . 
  even more expensive in cascais . 
  portugal stronk,

  the last legislature from ps did n't seem like it . 
  at least before they had no choice then to do a pec . 
  and only pec4 really woke up to reality . 
  because the anti-austerity parties got us here with big public spending . 
  there 's no trust for those political options . 
  great . 
  i love this measure and think it 's highly beneficial . 
  while some shady rich guys may come , a lot of chinese people are willing to invest outside of the china bubble . 
  if not in portugal , elsewhere . 
  that 's actually a problem with jw and [ brazilian sects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_church_of_the_kingdom_of_god ) here . 
   the one major thing i can think of is their pope pushing people to address climate change . 
  this actually seems irrelevant to me . 
  john paul ii was pretty aggressive in the political play-field . 
  specially fighting communism in eastern europe . 
   they have various charitable efforts , but i 'm not sure whether they actually do more good than harm . 
  well , in terms of a secular society , i would say this is the main focus . 
  i can only speak for my community where the whole social support is done by the local parish . 
  the town actually sends everyone towards the parish to get food . 
  beyond food , clothes and toys are distributed . 
  then , there is a lot of half-way houses , orphanages , hospitals , clinics ( especially mental clinics ) , baby-cares ( for poorer parents that need to keep working ) , child-cares , retirement homes , free tutoring for those who need it , day-cares for the retired . 
  basically anything that the state ca n't supply for the needy population , i see the church with replacements . 
  why would they do any harm ? 
  sunday-school for kids maybe does , because it tries to educate the kids in christian theism and i know / r/atheism goes apeshit with that . 
  but sunday school for teenagers focuses a lot more in society value , behavior , how we should behave and what we should become in the society . 
  always pushing for personal evolution . 
  your culture , values and stuff that seems intrinsic to your society was molded by catholicism . 
  even if you 're a non practitioner . 
  one good example , the sheer amount of pork products that exist in iberia . 
  really , we eat all of the pork in many different ways . 
  there 's a reason for that , especially after the crusades . 
  you can find other examples in day to day things of ways to act , react and deal with social relationships that are different in other cultures . 
  our mentalities are clearly different from the germanic protestants . 
  the way to do things , the way to plan ahead . 
   i can not think of anything `` catholic '' that is n't bad . 
  i hope you 're trolling on this . 
  better : you guys should be the new oriental group of the azores . 
  most of them are already there . 
  if not , we 'll just take ma . 
  i do n't know if i should be offended or if it was a compliment . 
  there 's a really good relationship with s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 e pr\u00edncipe and cabo verde though . 
  with timor-leste also i think . 
  if a bull weights 800kg and a man 70kg , 1vs1 is just suicide . 
  yeah i 've seen the velcro spikes . 
  it 's a great way to do it . 
  call the guys on foot [ forcados ] ( http://www.solesombra.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/amadores.jpg ) . 
   outnumbered i ca n't agree here . 
  10 man vs 1 bull to stop him from charging is not that outnumbered . 
   may 30th , one dead in azambuja ( plus 6 injured , 2 of them seriously ) well ... he did die in what 's called the ** table of death ** . 
  basically after everyone 's drunk you go to the middle of the square in a table and the bulls are released . 
  the last one to fall from the table wins !, 
  in portugal the horns have a protection , we also do n't kill the bull . 
  [ we also love to just catch it by hand in fancy suits . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r54meplpcwo ), 
  [ like this one ? 
  pay them in pasta . 
  this is / r/europe . 
  do n't we all have free condoms and pills ? 
  even though it 's amazing . 
  i think we should keep the cod as our great heritage or the cozido . 
  the francesinha is much more recent ( i believe ) . 
  hey , bullying is always better than the death penalty \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  americans : shorts and big tall and thik socks . 
  that was what the prosecution wanted to do . 
  then the british media completely overwhelmed our system . 
  the prosecutor was taken away from the case . 
  he then wrote a book about all of it and was promptly sued by the couple and they stopped the sale of the book ( which was then given away in a portuguese newspaper iirc ) . 
  my grandmother smuggled coffee between montalv\u00e3o and cedillo . 
  i think she brought rice as exchange , but not sure . 
  https://youtu.be/rhd2gocmvca at 7.20 they talk about it with some spanish people also talking . 
  they do travel as far as portugal . 
  and they 're so nice !, 
  do you actually know any catholic missionary ? 
  american missionaries ? 
   in 1996 , the social commission of the french bishops ' conference said that condom use `` can be understood in the case of people for whom sexual activity is an ingrained part of their lifestyle and for whom [ that activity ] represents a serious risk . 
  '' [ 36 ] in 1993 , the german bishops conference noted : `` in the final analysis , human conscience constitutes the decisive authority in personal ethics ... consideration must be given ... to the spread of aids . 
  it is a moral duty to prevent such suffering , even if the underlying behavior can not be condoned in many cases ... the church ... has to respect responsible decision-making by couples . 
  '' [ 37 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_church_and_hiv/aids#episcopal_conferences, 
  do n't be , we 'll craddle you < 3, 
  with the response the civil protection gave them they wo n't be . 
  150 people involded in the operations , a lot , a loooot of ambulances , 2 helicopters and a campaign hospital was erected on the scene as soon as it happened .
