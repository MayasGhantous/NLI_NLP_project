  http://www.thelocal.se/20140730/sweden-worst-in-eu-at-getting-foreigners-jobs its not easy to get a job as an european as well , from first hand experience . 
   middle eastern people are extremely dramatic , disorganized and emotionally intense [ so basically like south-europeans ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-lewis-model-2013-9?ir=t ) ? 
  that 's quite an oversimplification of the whole talk . 
  he does n't mention salary is very important . 
  precisely because there will be a shortage of qualified people it is likely their salary will go up . 
  supply and demand . 
  care to clarify ? 
  [ relevant ted talk ] ( http://go.ted.com/ztn ) about germany and ( the needed ) immigration .

  so nothing actually happened in the video ? 
  everything seemed very calm except for just one yell , but you would get that anywhere most likely . 
  nice to see people of any culture more accepting of lgbt rights in sweden .

  what the hell is up with gibraltar ? 
  time to get the popcorn ... again !, 
  they are showing mean income , not median . 
  if in a region there 's 1000 people , and 999 of them earn 500 $ / month , and one guy earns 10million $ / month , the average for everyone will be ~ 10k $ / month ... 
  thanks for posting , people need to be aware of how what we may perceive to be true may in fact be manipulated, 
  yeah , i said something similar in another comment :  it might be that greece and other countries should reject the emu ( eurozone ) until a better union is formed that binds the countries in a monetary union but also fiscal and budget union , with the central decisions being made by democratically elected representatives from all countries , at all levels of the european union . 
   what 's not okay is to keep insisting in austerity measures that will not enable the greek people to pay the debt ( and the interest from the loans ) and still have a functioning society . 
   perhaps something like the [ ulysses project ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=teixriuqowq ) might be a good first step forward . 
  to serve as an example so other countries that also owe money to europe do n't demand the same treatment . 
  it ~ ~ is ~ ~ used to be , after all , a union of equals ...

  you 'll scare the other tourists away !, 
  what the sea does n't want, 
  we have some lovely german submarines that we do n't really use . 
  maybe germany is interested in buying them back ? 
  yes and that makes one wonder ; the leaks in 2010 were partially the catalyst for the arab spring and all the mess we see now in syria and the refugee crisis . 
  it makes you wonder what can happen next with something as big as this , it 's scary actually . 
  that 's scary , and might be something to consider when discussing the benefits of nuclear power . 
  distributed renewable energy production is more reliable and resistant to environmental disasters as well as terrorist attacks than a centralized station whether it 's coal or nuclear, 
  so that spaniards could n't understand us , but we could still understand them . 
  also because it 's fun to have gendered objects . 
  and hard nasal tones . 
  latin alphabet is too boring without : \u00e0 , \u00e1 , \u00e2 , \u00e3 , \u00e9 , \u00ea , \u00f2 , \u00f3 , \u00f4 , \u00f5 , \u00ed , \u00fa , and \u00e7 . 
  and because it 's fun to invent [ new verb conjugations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_verb_conjugation ) . 
  viva iberia !, 
  that 's three of us !, 
  we 're probably better off creating our own sub for this kind of humor ; does n't seem to be so appreciated around here these days, 
  if they want the free movement of people to stop across europe , then the free movement of capital should also stop . 
  capital has been far more responsible for creating and funding the is , and therefore terrorist attacks , than the free movement of people . 
  keep in mind they have also been killing muslims . 
  far more , actually . 
  it 's not just a question of a certain religion vs another , but an organized institution with resources and access to weapons that can coordinate attacks wherever they want . 
  if anyone still had doubts , this is why refugees are flooding other me countries and europe . 
  if they stay there , they will be killed . 
  you are simply projecting your own preferred outcome to the reality . 
  the truth is that this agreement between the parties is legal , constitutional and possible . 
  they are entitled to make such post-electoral agreements , and if the voters that vote for them do n't agree in such post-electoral agreements , they can vote accordingly in the next election . 
  it might be easy for you to say that they are just power-grabbing from your point of view , and it may be true , but you can [ read ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/3sa3uv/pdf_os_acordos_que_o_ps_assinou_com_be_pcp_e_pev/ ) their agreements and wait to see what they actually do should they ever get in a position of power , only then can you claim that they are being dishonest or that they do n't have a genuine understanding . 
  everything else is pure speculation until then . 
  you 're correct , it was 43 % . 
  regardless , all politicians claim to represent the will of the people , despite the fact that they are usually only elected by a minority of the people . 
  even the coalition with the biggest amount of votes only received [ a fifth ] ( https://tmmv.github.io/abstencao/ ) of the total possible votes . 
  the will of the people can be as much represented by the paf government as it can by the ps+be+pcp+pev coalition . 
  both are legitimate , and it 's all about a numbers game . 
  `` the will of the people '' ? 
  more than half of the population did n't even vote . 
  anyone claiming to be representing the will of the people ( both `` right '' and `` left '' ) is fooling themselves . 
  you ca n't deny they are united in at least one thing : seeing the paf coalition out of the government . 
  while i do n't really support any of the parties with parliamentary representation , i think it 's rather good to see different parties come together and make compromises . 
  it 's good to see people put their differences apart and come together in what unites them , for a greater good . 
  it 's unlikely that any major changes will happen , but it 's a start . 
  democracy is about compromise for a common goal , for a greater good , not about an iron fist every 4 years . 
  i live in lund but i commute to malm\u00f6 twice a week . 
  never have i felt unsafe or have seen any of the horrible things that are apparently common every day if you were to believe the news . 
  i 'm not saying bad things do n't happen , and that jews are not insulted or provoked , but my understanding is that it 's nowhere near as common as other people might think . 
  and we should definitely fight for justice and law enforcement . 
  but thanks to the media we only hear about the provoking or bad news ( `` if it bleeds it leads '' ) , but never about the normal peaceful everyday or even the good things . 
  did you know , for example , that malm\u00f6 is [ one of the most sustainable cities ] ( http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/things-to-do/green-sweden/destinations/green-malmo/ ) in sweden , [ having won several awards ] ( http://malmo.se/english/technical-visits/awards-and-prizes.html ) ? 
  truth is , i feel more unsafe in lisbon , my home city , where i was mugged twice and stolen from once , than in the same ~ ~ time period ~ ~ amount of time in malm\u00f6 . 
  i actually feel safe walking at night in malm\u00f6 , whereas in lisbon i 'm always on the lookout for anyone that might try to harm . 
  and i still love lisbon .
