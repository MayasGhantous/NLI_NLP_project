whatever man , believe what you will . 
  i could n't care less . 
  i 'm not in the evangelizing business . 
   how the hell is anything i 've said somehow me being a dick ? 
  nah i 'm not even going there . 
  have a nice day and i really mean it . 
  [ circlejerk warning ] oh fuck this shit then !, 
  now i seriously question the legitimacy of this whole thing . 
  the timing is too revealing . 
  the us and uk were itching to get a good public support on invading syria to `` fight the isis '' . 
  now they might get it . 
  and it really is n't the isis m.o. 
  to spare on the gore . 
  nor is it to only send the video to journalists so they can hide the gruesome bits . 
  also , how can a video like this , posted on youtube , not be out there on liveleak ? 
  sure . 
  really ? 
  one minute we have to find suppliers who are not fracturing e.u. , the next minute a wild `` portugal '' appears out of nowhere just because i have some flag next to my username . 
  way to shift the focus of the issue at hand when it becomes less convenient . 
  sorry for the rudeness but yeah , way to be a dick , jim . 
  my country , when talking about energy imports , is e.u. . not portugal . 
  portugal does n't have shit to do with algeria , nor spain has for that matter . 
  it 's eu . 
  there 's no sovereignty when energy is concerned . 
  i should know . 
  i 'm here !, 
  same thing goes to algeria . 
  the company that supplies us with gas is the same that supplies oil is the same subsidiary owned by the govt that is an opec member which is a [ cartel ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cartel ) . 
  implying decisions are made on any lower level than that is a bit naive of you . 
  and still , are n't we talking about gas here ? 
  the main gas imports are up north , algeria is a non issue , they can not produce more than they already are . 
  it 's a dead end . 
  production has stabilized and started falling . 
  just by that they 're not an option to go to when we need to `` get better suppliers '' as you suggested . 
  and they are not an answer to my question , not by any chance . 
  as i said , do they not pressure e.u. 
  with prices ? 
  yeah ... they do , they 're part of a cartel . 
  the pressure they exert is deliberate and coordinated . 
  one day is gas crisis , the other is petrol . . and so on . 
  ( edit : this is in portugal . 
  just before you start minimizing the issue like this is not `` trading as a weapon '' . 
  i must insist . 
  to see where this is weaponized we have to look at it at the e.u. 
  vs opec scale . 
  it 's all geopolitic shenanigans from there . ), 
  every energy company uses trade as a weapon . 
  that 's my point . 
  the ones who do n't , are taken over . 
  btw ... you could have said norway and you had a better argument than that ... but you had to pick on the portugal thing did n't you ? 
  damn internet , i just want to have a straight forward conversation without all this bickering shit . 
  thank you for this . 
  hmm ? 
  i do n't follow you . . what is this `` algeria '' and what is this `` portugal '' thing you 're talking about ? 
  do n't you mean `` when is opec threatening e.u. '' ? 
  'cause that 's what we 're talking about is n't it ? 
  ... energy suppliers ... 
  furthermore , were n't we discussing gas ? 
  and lastly , does n't opec trade as a weapon also ? 
  the u.s. of a. govt [ should know ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/tboonepickens/2013/11/07/is-solving-the-opec-threat-our-nations-longest-unfulfilled-national-priority/ ) ... you 're close to them apparently . 
  go ask them about opec , then . 
   get better suppliers that do n't use trade as a weapon who ? 
  really , who 's not doing that in the energy industry ? 
  do n't worry guy . 
  i 'm with you on this . 
  we must always exercise critical thinking . 
  where can i find the complete video ? 
  man , that catalan referendum starting the day after the scots ' vote looks so much like a failed coordinated move that they just went on with it because they did n't know what to do with all the printed leaflets or whatever they had prepared already . 
  is language restriction ~ ~ even an ~ ~ a serious issue in catalu\u00f1a ? 
  edit : de-assholizing a bit . 
  i second this . 
  it 's quatre vingt quatre in french . 
  sounds magical enough . 
  no it 's not . 
  who are you ? 
  where are you from ? 
  what 's your home address ? 
  where were you on april 25th ???? 
  more for us , my friend !, 
  nope nope nope nope !, 
  it 's a bit hard to explain , but they have a very specific function and spectrum of action . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pol%c3%adcia_judici%c3%a1ria ), 
  translation of second link :  violence returned to the streets of cais do sodr\u00e9 , in lisbon , yesterday early in the morning . 
  the incident happened on dom lu\u00eds i street , in front of `` pal\u00e1cio do kebab '' restaurant , at around 7:30 am . 
  beware of the aggressiveness of the images we received . 
  according to sources from the police , the altercations started inside the restaurant when the owner was already closing shop , altercations that eventually progressed out on the street . 
  the police identified seven people involved in the brawl . 
  the owner of said restaurant and six youngsters of ages between 22 and 24 years old that were later identified at s. jos\u00e9 hospital and garcia da orta hospital , in almada . 
  as a firearm was involved , the case is now being investigated by pol\u00edcia judiciaria .

  [ oh you !, 
  spain : caramelos . 
  seriously . 
  and what was that other country 's name ? ... oh yes : spain : picos de europa are the nicest mountains of the iberian peninsula !, 
  they are so beautiful it gives me a bit of a hard-on just thinking about it . 
  i really love/envy you hermanos for this !, 
  nop ... germanish . 
  source : i heard `` frau '' and the dubbed voice said woman/women . 
   one started playing the xylophone in a macabre stunt , `` laughing sarcastically '' at the terrified audience . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/gapgyo0cbbi?t=15s ) is the only thing my priviledged european upbringing makes me think of .
