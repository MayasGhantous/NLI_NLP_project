a think this is a loaded question to convey a pre-defined conclusion . 
   generally speaking , do you think that having the euro is a good or a bad thing for your country ? 
  give a people a two scenarios , a familiar and imaginary one , people tend to choose the familiar one . 
  example :  do you prefer the current reddit or a different reddit ? 
  only if you have a consolidated idea that the `` current reddit '' has really failed you 're going to choose the `` current reddit '' . 
  there is no other reason to prefer a scenario that you do not know unless the familiar is bringing you significant suffering . 
  i would love to see the calculations because it looks bogus . 
  3.500.000.000 loss 700.000 infected computers . 
  cost per infection : 5000 $ 3.500.000.000 loss 4.207,14 reports ( only 63 % may incur in losses ) cost per report : 831919 $ sources : [ data ] ( https://www.cert.be/files/certbe_incidents_reported_2013.pdf ) , [ press release ] ( https://www.cert.be/docs/press-release-cyber-security-coalition ), 
   i actually like the european parliament . 
  they 've done a lot of good imo . 
  except make the eu respect no responses on the eu referendums . 
  [ os filhos do rock ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/programa/tv/p30539 ) `` sons of rock '' tells the story of the generation that went through the 80s and created the creative root what would become the boom of the portuguese rock . 
  i made the same type of comment ( with a lesser scale ) about portugal and the result was the same . 
  average joe prefers to `` defend '' his country than to admit all its faults . 
  background : for a few years the news showed several statics of the eu ( the 15 countries eu ) and portugal or greece were the worst countries . 
  usually the news report usually ended with a remark like `` portugal is 15/20 years behind the ue average '' . 
  now i make comments like `` do you want to jump 20 years into the future , migrate to a northern-europe country '' and my country fellows just go nuts . 
  you ca n't be a criminal lord without the police/the system allowing it . 
  good travel information here : https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/wiki/index unusual tourist places that i 'm aware : * ** a castle in the river ** : [ castle of almourol ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_of_almourol ) . 
  * ** the beaches on the south ** : [ nice beaches ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southwest_alentejo_and_vicentine_coast_natural_park ) with few foreign and national tourists . 
  * ** an alternative community ** : a kind of * hippie * community but might be interesting named [ tamera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamera ) . 
  * ** nazar\u00e9 ** : it 's pretty small city that recently got famous because of [ big wave surfing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazar%c3%a9_canyon ) . 
  * ** the santuary of senhora da pena ** : impressive [ landscape ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-teb14xlniuk/tzozjlw4nti/aaaaaaaaafe/bez553mbffq/s1600/festa%2bda%2bpeneda.jpg ) around the sanctuary . 
  * ** hydroelectric dams ** : there a [ big lake because ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alqueva_dam ) of one and the others might be interesting if you get a tour to see inside . 
  * ** an interesting fort ** : the fort of [ our lady of grace ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/forte_de_nossa_senhora_da_gra%c3%a7a ) [ impressive ] ( http://www.myworldshots.com/p1/m/portugal/elvas-forte-de-santa-luzia-13537.jpg ) but i 'm not sure you can visit it since it was kind of abandoned . 
  * ** kind of extreme sports ** : there a lot of places you can do them but since there is a recreational park that has a [ long zip line ] ( https://www.portugal4fun.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/fantasticable_4e36da558bedc.jpg ) so i point to [ them ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/attraction_review-g2199800-d2190015-reviews-pena_aventura_park-portela_de_santa_eulalia_vila_real_district_northern_portugal.html ) . 
  the good thing from visiting porto ( oporto for english speakers ) is that your close to other interesting places namely [ guimar\u00e3es ] ( http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/guimar%c3%a3es ) and [ braga ] ( http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/braga ) which are both beautiful historic places . 
  if you venture to braga a trip to the [ ger\u00eas national park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peneda-ger%c3%aas_national_park ) is recommended . 
  travel to all these destinations is easy with a car ( most of portuguese 's have cars ) i 'm not sure about if it 's viable for a tourist . 
  ps : porto airport has several low cost companies operating so you can get there cheaply and it 's a cheap place for a lot of europeans . 
  lol as much the italians are ok with the mafia , 
  i just expect that a professional football player to have some resistance to pressure . 
  besides , [ everything is offensive ] ( http://youtu.be/zwoqzb5r6vw ) so what 's point ? 
  maybe the player should grow some thick skin . 
  a degree of self-importance and they think they talk the correct portuguese . 
   the eu student exchange programme erasmus has led to the birth of one million babies , according to a study published monday . 
  nearly a quarter of former erasmus students met their current partner while ** drinking ** abroad . 
  corrected for you . 
   legal drinking age 0-years !, 
  leave the kids alone !, 
  it 's true that some people call the danish the southern people of the scandinavia because they are more easy going and `` chaotic '' ? 
  i would add lausanne ( switzerland ) since there so many portuguese people there :d, 
  when i talk about pushing russia i mean nato arming the countries near the russia border . 
  i think that just means that other countries follow usa but usa does n't follow them :p, 
  three main reasons leaving nato would improve ue countries : * 1 - no more pushing russia for no reason * 2 - break the cycle of usa dependency ( ue has no weapons because usa has too much weapons therefore ue does n't need weapons ... ) * 3 - when nato/usa safety net desapears a ue-country would soon be born . 
  also , it 's boring being in nato just to follow what usa wants . 
  * 1 - a ue referendum to check if the europeans wants this `` union '' * 2 - abide the referendum results * 3 - eu countries leave nato and start their self-defence only military alliance . 
  i would bet the economics of someone who supports all mainstream ideas or lives in a bubble . 
  for crying out loud !, 
  want cheap planes tickets ? 
  yes , please invite any low cost company to use the baltic 's airports . 
  but please , do n't waste money on beer to lower the price of wine because that 's the alcohol talking !, 
  i do n't think you understand how percentages work ... 
  breaking news everyone : there is new type of transportation that 's cheaper than anything else for anything more than 200km ... 
  it 's a fucking plane !, 
  welcome to the 21th century !, 
  i do n't think the lack of definition is the problem ... 
  if means that means taxes most will say no , if just means ecb printing more money ( since nobody understands it ) they will vote yes . 
  the article is good but i pay close attention to the proposed goals :  the action plan has three main objectives : `` effective communication and promotion of eu policies and values towards the eastern neighborhood ; '' the `` strengthening of the overall media environment including support for independent media , '' as well as increased public awareness of disinformation activities by external actors ; and an improved eu capacity to anticipate and respond to such activities . 
  to be against russia propaganda and promote eu policies and values is not independent media , is just to propose an different propaganda . 
  and how can they raise awareness of disinformation by external actors when they are trying to promote a message through several `` independent '' media channels ? 
   the document states that communication towards the east should `` first and foremost focus on the development of positive and effective messages regarding eu policies towards the region . '', 
  their first priority is to promote eu and not promote different perspectives on the same issues because that is independent media . 
   brussels needs to spread the message that reforms promoted by the european union `` can , over time , have a positive impact on their daily lives , '' the action plan says . 
  it underscores that the strategy should highlight the benefits , not the bureaucracy , focusing on clearly explaining the positive effects of eu programs and policies rather than going into details about the policies . 
  they 're trying to promote simple ideas about eu without explaining them ( not going into details ) and avoid some issues with it like the bureaucracy . 
  this is a classic propaganda agenda , simple positive messages ( eu will end poverty ) without details ( how is eu going to end poverty ? ), 
  and clear outcomes of programs designed from brussels to a whole continent ( bureaucracy ) . 
   the action plan also calls for the 28-nation eu to more actively to promote freedom of the media in the `` eastern neighborhood '' region , mainly in concert with the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) and the council of europe . 
  proposals include targeted training and `` capacity building '' for journalists and media outlets in the region . 
  brussels will also `` consider how best it can support training for journalists experiencing conflict situations , to better enable them to report on issues of relevance to local populations . '', 
  all this said , who do think is going to get `` capacity building '' from the local independent media ? 
  those who want to tell the truth , which includes eu , russia and nato wrongdoings or just those who report on russia wrongdoings ? 
  `` in war , truth is the first casualty . '', 
  greetings sir/miss . 
  i 'm sad that it looks irrelevant for the / r/europe that the eu is creating its own propaganda medium . 
  it 's also sad that i discovered this trough the rt , the devil , of russia propaganda . 
  ( video -  googling -  submitting -  found your post ) . 
  i also laughed of the zero votes because it 's exactly what i expected from the / r/europe . 
  news about dangerous behaviour from the eu with russia are outside of the allowable/popular opinion . 
  yes , they are pretty cool . 
  it 's just that the band name is also related to the ramstein air base . 
  do you work/live at the rammestein base ? 
  because they are in the war business . 
  go where ? 
  :o it would be fun to see greece moving to near china . 
   we have a better debate climate than denmark . 
  what about the important things ... how 's the beer ? 
   feminism and lgbt or just equal rights for everyone . 
   1 ) europeans are just as `` patriotic '' as americans are . 
  i do n't so . 
  americans are americans , europeans are germans , french , italians , portuguese ... and then ... maybe europeans . 
  there is n't really a eu or european identity . 
  for that to happen a ue army needs to exist and them someone to attack eu so everyone feels nice and coozy to say they are eu citizens . 
   3 ) eu army is a pipe dream . 
  it 's a pipe dream but it 's going to happen , might just take some time to do it . 
  the eu-elite have this dream for a while but they just lack the political support ... 
  someday someone is going to propose a ue presidential election from a eu wide vote ... then an army will appear . 
  a few years latter the chain of command will be all into eu .
