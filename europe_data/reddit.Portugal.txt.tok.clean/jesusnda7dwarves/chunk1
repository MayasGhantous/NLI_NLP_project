both in the 80 's * [ carlos lopes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_lopes ) - `` he brought home portugal 's first ever olympic gold medal along with a new olympic record '' * [ rosa mota ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosa_mota ) . 
  `` first woman to win multiple olympic marathon medals as well as being the only woman to be the reigning european , world , and olympic champion at the same time '' repercussions were that people were very happy , and very proud , and ... yeah ... that . 
   1 sextillion ( 10 ^ 21 ) is n't a sextillion 10 ^ 6x6 = 10 ^ 36 ? 
  how does this work ? 
  how do you get to claim it without colonising it ? 
  i thought territories far from mainland had to be either colonised , or part of an archipelago that is colonised , or something of the sort to be claimed ... 
  consider spotify . 
  it arrived in portugal only in 2013 . 
  they have to deal with the laws and licences in each country , making it a rather painful process . 
  so it 's difficult to expand . 
   however , for western kids here , yes relationship between girls and boys is common . 
  we need to dig deeper on this !, 
  :d what about pre-marital sex ? 
  is it supposedly common ? 
  is it forbidden by law ? 
  are people afraid of being legally punished for it , and if so does punishment happen often to youngsters ? 
  like i said , i love this sub , and i 'm not going to sub hop because of some ass who wants to take over . 
  i generally like the mod team . 
  the community is great and pretty big . 
  this is the default sub for people from europe and i want it to be a good one . 
  this mod was kicked out of other subs and same should happen here . 
  my comment is about / r/europe and in its defence . 
  it 's about this subreddit and this subreddit only . 
  it 's a great sub . 
  it 's a regionally default sub . 
  and it should n't have shitty mods on power trips . 
  even if true that it does n't ` pay off ' , is n't that analysis a bit misleading ? 
  that is , would n't there be other ` profits ' other than just saving lives ? 
  for instance , people who would end up less time in the hospital or need cheaper treatments . 
  and gains in efficiency , having to spend less time taking information and looking for vehicles ? 
  people often can take quite a while to explain where they are , particularly if they do n't know the area well , or if it 's in the middle of some small area not very well known to the emergency services . 
  because ... ? 
  like i said before all that talk is very noble , however as everyone knows germany and france were the first to break the growth and stability pact , suffered no backlash , and the result were amended rules . 
  i know he was n't in power but what was/is opinion about it ? 
  and how strongly did he express it at the time ? 
  and regardless of his own personal opinion , how does he manage the fact that when rules were broken by germany and france , there was no backlash and instead the rules were amended , with his current stronghold on greece ? 
  i do n't know where he was in 2003 ... do you know if he did happen to voice that opinion back then , when germany broke the stability and growth pact ? 
  maybe you should be saying that to those leaders who were pushing anti-syriza propaganda during greek election times ? 
  for fuck sake , the day syriza won portugual 's prime minister 's [ reaction ] ( http://rr.sapo.pt/informacao_detalhe.aspx?fid=27&amp;did=176139 ) , rather than congratualte them , was to come to public say syriza 's discourse was like a children 's fairy tale , and that they should n't risk their country 's economy . 
  that 's diplomacy ? 
  i agree , but i think the beliefs should be taught as part of a history of religion class . 
  in particular because the beliefs change with society in time , as sects appear and evolve . 
  note also that list , taken from his profile , is sorted by number of subscriptions . 
  and / r/europe , which is huge , is only his 7th biggest sub . 
  the top ones have millions of users . 
  and look at the range of subjects . 
  it makes it obvious this is all about power and controlling tendencies . 
  his behaviour here has made that obvious and ex mods have said as much . 
  yet this is allowed to continue . 
  i 've seen it mentioned that he was mod at / r/canada too and eventually got kicked out ( do double check this info though ) . 
  i honestly do not understand why he 'd be kept around here . 
  or how he got this position in the first place . 
  it 's just some hungry power reddit obsessed dude . 
  the people who demanded a 4.5 surplus from greece calling varoufakis an amateur . 
  do n't let them jump the line then ? 
  yeah but you did n't answer the question did you ? 
  by the way , someone did [ try a post about modding ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330shj/suggestion_integrating_european_subreddits_and/cqgpoxv ) , but unsurprisingly got deleted . 
  here 's the deal , he 's a trigger happy power-hungry karma whore , mod in over 100 subs , and subredditdrama fanatic . 
  he has no business being a mod here . 
  considering he 's been fucking up this place i think it is . 
  where are we supposed to make such complaints in ? 
  modmail where he 'll ignore them ? 
  i guess our all powerful op should remove all other ttip posts and make his own sticky , where he monitors comments and removes all opinions he does n't like . 
  it 's always fun when he does that . 
  can we get rid of him already ? 
  he does so well in subreddit drama ... why come here at all ? 
  i did n't know voldemort was a moderator of 128 subreddits , a big fan of subredditdrama , and liked to censor people with opinions he did n't like . 
  i am of the opinion that everyone should do their part towards creating a better world . 
  and being in a privileged position we have added responsibility . 
  it is however dangerous what i see as a common extreme , where ~ ~ the ~ ~ we are to blame for everything or at least are considered obligate to fix everything in problematic countries , whereas they themselves have no responsibility in their destiny . 
  we are still using these countries for our benefits ? 
  here 's a few headlines from the last few years : http://www.economist.com/node/21528310  ** angola and portugal - role reversal **  `` historically the angolans worked for the portuguese , but now it 's the portuguese who are working for the angolans , '' says paulo pimenta , a portuguese lawyer based in mozambique . 
  `` people have to get used to it . '' `` this is definitely a first for africa , '' says pedro seabra of the portuguese institute for international relations and security , `` that the dynamics between colony and master have been so inverted . '' https://cpj.org/blog/2013/03/portuguese-media-chilled-by-angolan-involvement.php  ** portuguese media chilled by angolan involvement **  portuguese journalists are increasingly concerned by angola 's growing investment and influence in their country . 
  buoyed by petrodollars and diamonds , powerful angolan interests have been indulging in a buying spree in their former colonial power . 
  angolan capital invested in portugal increased 35 times in the past decade , according to news reports . 
  in a process often acidly described in lisbon as a form of `` reverse colonization , '' angolans have gobbled up not only significant chunks of portugal 's banking , telecommunications , and energy companies , but also invested in the portuguese media sector . 
  interesting though how despite that angola is a land of inequality , filled with poverty , and little investment in a proper education of their people and diversification of their economy . 
  surprising ? 
  not really ? 
  their president , jos\u00e9 eduardo dos santos , has now been in power for 35 years . 
  the elites are corrupt to to the core . 
  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/opinion/in-angola-growing-wealth-but-shrinking-democracy.html how do you think his little girl became the richest woman in africa ? 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2013/08/14/how-isabel-dos-santos-took-the-short-route-to-become-africas-richest-woman/ dodging taxes ? 
  in africa ? 
  that happens everywhere . 
  do you think companies are not dodging taxes in europe ? 
  it 's up to governments to fix loopholes and supervise . 
  it 's up to their government to do their job . 
  i gave the example of angola because it is the most glaring . 
  but it 's not restricted to them . 
  nor restricted to africa . 
  portugal has been playing a fundamental role in the development of east timor as a nation . 
  just recently there was a rather serious diplomatic clash , because they 've expelled a bunch of our judges from the country . 
  apparently the portuguese judges decided a bit too much `` against the interests of timor '' , by ruling in favour of entities who sued the state . 
  lets not just blame ourselves for all the shit that happens in these countries . 
  we have enough on our plate already . 
  i understand you were n't referring to anyone in particular , and obviously none of what happened back then is our personal and direct responsibility ( as individuals ) . 
  to be clear , i talked only of portugal and its colonies because that 's what i 'm more informed about ( and even then i am no historian , so double check and feel free to contradict anything i say ) . 
  like i said , i am in no way claiming we did no harm . 
  indeed we took over their resources , did n't care enough for the population , and there was social discrimination ( not so much as a national policy , but white rich assholes being white rich assholes ) .
