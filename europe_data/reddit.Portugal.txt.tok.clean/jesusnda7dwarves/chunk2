  but we have however to be fair in our analysis . 
  remember even in portugal the situation was pretty shitty , with lots of inequality , lack of education in the periphery , and under a pretty harsh dictatorship . 
  despite all flaws and greed , portugal did improve and invested in the region , built some pretty amazing cities , made some attempts and improving social condition and giving them more autonomy , and finally did at least try to leave in a sustained manner , maintaining good relations and leaving the territories at peace . 
  if we 're going to blame someone , it 's only fair that most of it should go to those who instead pressured us to get out , in order for themselves to take over ( via installed governments ) , and financed their chosen military faction leading them to decades of civil war . 
  i do agree decolonisation should have been gradual and sustained . 
  but i would n't say that , e.g. 
  in the case of portugal they themselves are to be blamed for the sudden withdrawal . 
  i 'm not trying to claim in any way portugal does n't have responsibilities on the matter . 
  on the contrary . 
  but it 's not like portugal leaders just woke up one day and said , eh fuck it , lets leave . 
  we were under a dictatorship , and one who was against decolonisation and in favour of more autonomy to what they called oversea provinces rather than colonies . 
  however , we were completely isolated against the international community in this matter . 
  furthermore , with plenty of outside interference , armed rebellion built up and portugal found itself fighting the colonial wars . 
  once portugal toppled its dictatorship , and with the population sick of a bloody war , the decolonisation process begun . 
  portugal did try to set up interim governments and a peaceful transition . 
  it would have been however politically unsustainable to impose very long transition periods , as neither the international community nor those fighting for independence would have allowed it . 
  regardless , even those attempts at a sustainable transition failed ( as should have been expected ) with different groups backed up by different international factions fighting for the control of the country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angola#independence_and_civil_war  following negotiations held in portugal , itself experiencing severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the april 1974 revolution , angola 's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in january 1975 . 
  within two months , however , the fnla , mpla and unita had started fighting each other and the country began splitting into zones controlled by rival armed political groups . 
  the mpla gained control of the capital luanda and much of the rest of the country . 
  with the support of the united states , za\u00efre and south africa intervened militarily in favour of the fnla and unita with the intention of taking luanda before the declaration of independence . 
  [ 16 ] [ 17 ] in response , cuba intervened in favor of the mpla ( see : cuba in angola ) , which became a flash point for the cold war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozambique#independence_.281975.29  as part of their response to frelimo , the portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth . 
   after 10 years of sporadic warfare and portugal 's return to democracy through a leftist military coup in lisbon , which replaced portugal 's estado novo regime for a military junta ( the carnation revolution of april 1974 ) , frelimo took control of the territory . 
  within a year , most of the 250,000 portuguese in mozambique had left - some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory , some fleeing in fear - and mozambique became independent from portugal on 25 june 1975 . 
  in an act of vengeance , a law had been passed by the then relatively unknown armando guebuza in the frelimo party ordering the portuguese to leave the country in 24 hours with only 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) of luggage . 
  unable to salvage any of their assets , most of them returned to portugal penniless . 
   the new government , under president samora machel , established a one-party state based on marxist principles . 
  the new government received diplomatic and some military support from cuba and the soviet union and proceeded to crack down on opposition . 
  starting shortly after the independence , the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war, 
  of course we shot enemy soldiers . 
  not prisoners , but to shoot a prisoner you have to make someone a prisoner first . 
  and you do n't engage a soldier invading your country the same way you do with a common thief . 
  it seems pretty standard to shoot and be shot to kill from first contact until one side surrenders . 
  while i mostly agree with you , there may be an argument that these are actually fighters from some proto-wannabe-state that is at war with france . 
  your criticism is beyond laughable . 
  so a guy makes some [ idiotic claim ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/318mfs/greece_draws_up_drachma_plans_prepares_to_miss/cpzt0ux ) that he simply pulls out of his ass . 
  then / u/fuchsiamatter contradicts him , and backs up his own position with a blog post by a very well respected economist , a post itself based on data sourced from an ocde report . 
  and then he even links to the report itself . 
  and you complain about the latter because he did n't post the link to the report in the first comment . 
  you got to be fucking kidding me . 
  i know that 's not what they are demonstrating about . 
  my point is your argument is stupid . 
  your argument does n't depend on what they are demonstrating about but on the fact that they are allowed to do demonstrations and express their thoughts . 
  i honestly do n't get your point . 
  of course everyone is allied to have their own opinion . 
  but if a community are say pro slavery of black people , want to make rape legal , including sex with children , marriage at 5 years old , a hierarchy with those on the bottom having no benefits and not being allowed to have sex , and public stonings and decapitations to be commonplace ... 
  i 'd say it 's fair to say that such people would n't be well integrated . 
  and it 's fair to be worried about such a community increasing in size and power . 
  this talk about ... oh it was a manifestation and they can do so if they wish . 
  yeah they can . 
  but that does n't mean their ideas are sane , or compatible with out society , or that we should n't worry about them . 
  the problem is not that they expressed their position . 
  the problem is that this is their position . 
  and that the big majority of the muslim population is in line with this position . 
  that is the problem . 
  i do n't see how comparing them with a group of people most of us agree to be pieces of shit proves any point . 
  if you are from copenhagen , which was home to pretty big protests against the cartoons , this in a country where the muslim community is rather small , indeed you should have a pretty good idea of how integrated and moderate they are . 
   i 've found germany to be better at integration than a lot of countries though and yet :  merkel honours danish muhammad cartoonist westergaard  ( ... )  germany 's central muslim council ( zmd ) criticised ms merkel for attending the award ceremony . 
  mr westergaard is under constant police protection and security at the awards ceremony was high  a zmd spokesman , aiman mazyek , told public broadcaster deutschlandradio that the chancellor was honouring someone `` who in our eyes kicked our prophet , and therefore kicked all muslims '' . 
   he said giving mr westergaard the prize in a `` highly charged and heated time '' was `` highly problematic '' . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11236158 well integrated people also tend not to do this :  2006 german train bombing plot  on july 31 , 2006 , two people placed two suitcases filled with bombs on regional trains in germany . 
  the bombs were supposed to go off near hamm and koblenz and according to german investigators , would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people . 
  however , due to faulty construction , the bombs did not go off . 
  it is sensationalising . 
  because it makes it sounds like people can be arrested for no notice with no evidence and not able to defend themselves and it 's quite the opposite . 
  it 's only possible to do so in very particular cases . 
  it requires strong evidence . 
  it 's decided by a judge . 
  it has to be revised regularly to be renewed . 
  and it 's possible to appeal . 
  as for socrates it is n't true that there was no risk of escaping nor that that was the sole or most important argument used to justify his detention . 
  furthermore he has appealed to higher instances , and his case was appreciated and he lost . 
  he 's somewhat sensationalising it . 
  yes people be placed under preventive detention without charges being pressed . 
  but that makes it sound like anyone can be detained for no reason , which is not the case at all . 
  first there needs to be strong evidence of serious crimes . 
  and then you have to show evidence that the suspect could either otherwise : 1 . 
  escape from justice ( e.g. 
  be preparing to fly abroad ) 2 . 
  interfere with the investigation 3 . 
  continue with the criminal activity so with strong evidence , why do n't they just press charges ? 
  it depends . 
  sometimes it 's more a matter of what charges are going to be pressed . 
  in the case of our ex prime minister for instance ( currently under preventive detention ) , apparently there 's enough evidence to charge him with quite a few crimes , and strong leads pointing out also to corruption . 
  but whether he 'll be charged for corruption also depends on how much evidence they can gather . 
  nowhere in my comment did i talk about having a discussion with any opponent . 
  regardless of whomever this opponent you 're talking about may be . 
  any and all of those . 
  they are just human and living in a county with massive propaganda . 
  it is harmful . 
  it crates an us versus them mentality . 
  in situations of tension it is important to try and maintain ties between the people . 
  the people are the one who could ultimately prevent a bigger disgrace from happening , should hostilities escalate . 
  if it 's expected why did n't anyone try to prevent it ? 
  you see politicians constantly making an effort to differentiate between islamic terrorism and islam . 
  definitely all criticism has been directed at the russian government and not russians . 
  but it would n't hurt to stress this fact in the media , in an attempt to avoid this from happening .
