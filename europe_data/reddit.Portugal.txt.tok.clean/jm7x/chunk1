awesome view of the nasa space control center at cape canaveral , florida , usa . 
  ^ ( great subtitles all around . 
  lmao ), 
  you could fool me with the 40 % ( it 's like a once in a lifetime event , so ... ) , but the 27 % ? 
  nope . 
  no way . 
  did the survey only include 70 + years old people or some village in the back of the woods ? 
  yeah , the initials of * for\u00e7a a\u00e9rea portuguesa * just call for endless puns in english ... e.g. 
  their [ official web site ] ( http://www.emfa.pt ) even has a page called `` fap online '' . 
  :-p and `` portuguese air force '' -  `` paf '' does n't sound much better ... ( well , the national airlines company is called `` tap '' -- * transportes a\u00e9reos portugueses * , so you see a trend here . 
  at least they often write it as `` air portugal '' instead ), 
  ** portugal ** * twice his week , russian tu-95 bombers were intercepted , identified and escorted off portuguese coast by portuguese air force f-16 . 
  this type of operation targeting military aircraft had not happened since the cold war days . 
  some photos in [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l0nyf/pictures_of_portuguese_f16_intercepting_russian/ ) . 
  * fap f-16 fighters were also similarly busy [ over the baltic sea ] ( http://www.aco.nato.int/nato-tracks-largescale-russian-air-activity-in-europe.aspx ) as part of the nato [ baltic air-policing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) mission . 
  ireland and bohemia living up to their names . 
  cds ca n't afford to be euroskeptic . 
  they will , however , say anything that can grab some more votes -- and the opposite the same day , to grab a few more . 
  then we have : * pcp - still sturdily on the side of the soviet union . 
  secretly , comrade stalin is considered the last true communist . 
  somebody has still to convince them both died years ago . 
  * be - pcp is too right wing . 
  comrade mao lives ( ? ), 
  which is the same to say : as we usually do follow france fashion , we 'll elect our own hollande , with the usual few years delay . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  never thought the us were so bad in this . 
  not sure what type of corruption you 're talking about , so i 'll assume the type democracy is made of : government pays for things like * social security ( pensions , unemployment subsidies ... ) * national health service ( mostly free health care ... ) * public education ( mostly free ... ) ... in exchange for votes in the next election . 
  got it right ? 
  cutting the money to pay for these things makes the bad guys reduce them . 
  but ca n't see why would they leave . 
  fewer people will vote , but the same guys get elected . 
  you see , bad guys are always interested in running the government anyway . 
  and good guys tend to avoid politics as a career , unfortunately . 
  you 'll have to come up with another strategy , i 'm afraid . 
  i consider myself experienced at detecting sarcasm , but in this case i have to ask if you intended an '' / s '' at the end of that or if you are just trolling . 
  lol on the 1st choice , wtf at the 2nd . 
  wow !, 
  really ?? 
  we are really a backwards country . 
  few here would think that `` umbrellas in many colours '' = = `` lgbt flag '' . 
  even if someone did , it would be probably a reason to make them stay longer . 
  so , i doubt that they had to be removed for that ... 
  more importantly , it appears that after we give the stare ( that is quite intimidating , i assure you ) , we rather sparingly offer the kick or the punch . 
  we even mostly dispense with the verbal insult . 
  but lord , the stare ... ( * shivers * ) the stare !!, 
  ^ ( this comment should be read slow and solemnly by a john cleese impersonator . ), 
  ( [ background music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=avas-u4od6w ) ) but it is indeed a serious european problem . 
  i do n't mean to be mean . 
  i mean ... ok , i 'll shut up now . 
   everythime i 've been in border towns and border regions i notice that everyone speaks portuguese with a spanish accent when you go to galiza ( minho/tr \u00e1s-os-montes ) this happens in both sides of the border . 
   and they also speak spanish . 
  this happens more in the galiza side :-) well , at my mother 's village in tr\u00e1s-os-montes , the 5 nearest villages/towns are all spanish ( it 's in an enclave ) . 
  when i spent some time there in my vacations , we bought fresh bread in spain , because it was the nearest baker shop ( our house was some 300m from the border line ) . 
  when i was a kid , when i brought back the bread ( or groceries ) , i was technically smuggling goods ( before eec ... ) . 
  i could be arrested by the * guarda fiscal * or perhaps the * guardia civil * on the other side . 
  never was , though ;-), 
  for once , your stereotype may be right . 
  italy , portugal and spain were the first importers to europe , and still today you 'll find the finest coffees and coffee houses ( caf\u00e9 is a portuguese word , btw ) there . 
  difference is , we like to savour it in * expresso * quantities , not drown in it . 
  are those numbers right ? 
  for a country the size of russia , 186k is a drop in the bucket . 
  it 's only twice the people that left portugal in 2013 , but russia has a population 14x greater ... cf. 
  [ wikipedia : demographics_of_russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia ), 
  rolling stones beatles police u2 ( i could go on and on ... you catch my drift ) i assume i can ( * still * ) say the british and irish are european ? 
  essentially 90 % of all pop music that survives more than 6 months ( * ) is made by them . 
  ( * ) = `` any good '' i sense there something important that i missed ... 
  i guess the current state is too new for us to already have a new portuguese word for it , sorry . 
  we could just say `` moldova '' , it sounds just fine . 
  back to topic : * dragostea din tei * is one of my all time favourites !, 
  and it 's the only song in romanian i ever heard . 
  it looks like he left portugal for last because he could n't think of anything to write : - citing our greatest xx century poet is n't going to piss anyone off , indeed it 's a very popular verse . 
  we invented the whole self-deprecating concept , see ? 
  - the rest ( insinuating we 're part of spain , or speak spanish ) is a bit better : mildly annoying -- but we 're too used to it to really piss us off . 
  the worse that could happen would be enduring an annoying explanation about portugal existing much before there was a country named spain , etc. 
  ps : i 'm quite sure the last picture was taken in portugal ( two elderly gentlemen having a * sesta * at the park ... ) . 
  the photographer 's name is also a hint ... 
  actually , though it can be argued that the government was doing that before 2007 , since the creation of the euro our growth had essentially stopped ( < 1 % ) . 
  so , not really evident how could we pare down debts and save . 
  on the contrary , every budget added more debt . 
  after 2007 , some say ( not me ) the ecb encouraged eurozone governments to do as you said -- and portugal 's was particularly enthusiastic in 2008-2009 , with disastrous results . 
  oh , and btw , when you say `` spending '' you 're talking of investment , i presume ? 
  not raising pensions and salaries in election year or other political tricks of the trade ... ? 
  so at least , we now have one of the best highway networks in europe -- pity there 's not enough traffic to pay for it . 
  not even the maintenance ... as for the oc statement :  sustainable growth comes from private consumption . 
  this is true when you 're producing what is consumed ( or the equivalent in exports ) . 
  not when it 's mostly imported : in that case , you 're just sustaining the growth of other countries . 
  with debt , no doubt . 
  then , one fine day , you find creditors are reluctant to lend you more money . 
  they realised you may not have enough to pay it back . 
  this was in april 2011 for the government , but the private sector was guilty as well . 
  boom , troika , recession ... 
  we tried that here . 
  did n't work , bankruptcy of the state was barely avoided -- at the cost of some humiliating troika terms ... 
  so , now we have massive debt fuelled austerity instead . 
  it would be better to not have any of this in the first place , i tell you . 
  yes it is . 
   it might be expensive but * also is still a very beautiful city ftfy which city are you talking about ? - ), 
  i did hear and read `` chuac '' from brazilians ... `` mu\u00e1 '' is more like the european version . 
  never heard `` plec '' :-) it 's a pity they did n't show '' \u00c3o '' for the dogs . 
  it 's the phonetically most accurate impression of a ( big ) dog barking in all languages i know .
