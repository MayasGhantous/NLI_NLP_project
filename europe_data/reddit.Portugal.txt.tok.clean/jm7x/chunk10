  let me add another suggestion for a name like supremely high integrated territories , or , in short , ( exactly ), 
  how about : a place where the police are german , chefs are british , the mechanics are french , the lovers are swiss , and it 's all organized by the italians . 
   the tech support is estonian * sorry for taking this out , the original joke did n't have it . 
  no computers yet , then ... *, 
  those communist apples look delicious , comrade . 
  nah , that 's all about our spanish neighbours ... :-), 
  that was in 2012 , it has improved a little since then . 
  unlikely . 
  but i hope he did . 
  well , i said i drink coffee a lot and got `` greece '' , apparently because greeks do n't like coffee . 
  what gives ? 
  at least i have soulmates in the united kingdom and portugal , who knew ... not so many in poland or ireland , they say . 
  lol , even portugal beats norway . 
  perhaps their absurdly high oil-based gdp has something to do with that ... ? 
  it ends at a sharp nude . 
  cool . 
  ah , norwegian oil ... * dollar signs pop out of both eyes , drools *, 
  this reminds me of an old , old joke : in an ideal europe : * cooks are french * mechanics are german * policemen are english * lovers are italian ( * ) * all is organised by the swiss rather instead of : * cooks are english * mechanics are french * policemen are german * lovers are swiss * and all is organised by the italians ... ^ ( * substitute various southern countries at will here ), 
  i see . 
  thanks for clarifying that . 
  / u/sperrel did mention `` shipwrecked in the gulf of cadiz '' , and that can mean spanish ... or portuguese waters . 
  i guess the principle is the same , although here it 's a bit more complicated than that : you have to demand receipts from certain dealers/shops , identified with your fiscal number . 
  only certain services give you not only a discount in your tax ( vat ) , but also that lottery ticket ( 1 per 10 $ of vat ) . 
  those services are chosen among the most notorious in evading taxes , like hairdressers , car/motorcycle repair shops , restaurants ... well , incentives to do things that are mandatory anyway , yes . 
  today they gave me my first tickets , yay :-), 
  interesting . 
  i know nothing about maritime law ; was that outcome based on the location of the shipwreck in spanish waters or in being a spanish ship ? 
  or both ? ... 
  i 'm gon na play dirty and bring up that old trump card : portuguese `` saudade '' . 
  sorry google , `` longing '' is far from a good translation . 
  lol , it was ? 
  please care to expand that . 
  i 'm curious . 
  perhaps being in indonesian waters ( if i read correctly ) will be more important to assert the rights to the treasure , but please go on . 
  but i did n't think of that !, 
  if some 60t of gold came tumbling down from 500 years away , it could come handy to portugal to help with the current financial crisis . 
  :-) ( at least if the bce would allow its sale , a quite unlikely outcome ), 
  nothing , nowhere , i do n't know yet , none whatsoever , and no , i do n't know of anybody that 's even trying to make any sense out of it . 
  great example of `` thought placement '' , repeating no less than three times the sentence `` stolen treasure from the malaccan sultanate '' . 
  it 's almost as they are suggesting that treasure really should `` return '' to the current `` sultans '' of malacca ... 
  it seems that whatever we do , germany always wins . 
  sorry , but portuguese does have a word for `` cool '' : `` fixe '' . 
  ( for laughs , it sounds exactly as the english `` fish '' ), 
  `` internet '' . 
  it 's so perfect not only i do n't know of any translation , i would n't even think of translating it . 
  and i 'm not only talking about portuguese here . 
  however , if any fellow europeans did such a thing , by all means speak up !, 
  for centuries we portuguese liked to adapt many french words , after all it 's usually easy . 
  not the case however with `` logiciel '' , sorry . 
  not easier to adapt directly to portuguese than `` software '' , anyway . 
  i still find it quit elegant , and it sounds great !, 
  well we just did steal it , pronounciation and all !, 
  but i beg to differ : i find it a quite clever , even cunning , invention . 
  the only language i know that managed to translate it was french , and they had to invent it totally from scratch ( `` logiciel '' , see other comments ) . 
  the problem with `` software '' as a start is that it 's really a pun , and these rarely ( never ) translate . 
  i admire the english speakers for incorporating a pun as a full-fledged dictionary definition without any problem :-) origin : computers were the first machines that only worked with two things : the parts , pieces and bolts common to all machines -- and something you could not see ( the programs ) . 
  the first thing is easy : `` hardware '' . 
  so , that other thing could be ... 
  right ? 
  i think this is why english vocabulary easily beats any other language in technical fields . 
  it 's great to write and read tech reports . 
  ok , literature in general . 
  ( too bad about the weak grammar that makes it a nightmare to learn , and how horrible it sounds to speak and hear , but you could n't have it all ...  - ) ), 
  thanks , i did n't know the author . 
  i 'll add the attributtion to my signatures file ... 
  this is one of my all-time favourites . 
  yeah , we simply say `` software '' , english spelling and all . 
  we contemplated saying `` coisas moles '' and it just did n't sound right ... ( ok , it 's downright hilarious ) . 
  in a thesis i wrote in 1990 i translated it as `` programas '' ( = `` programs '' ) , but did n't like it either . 
  even a uni professor that was compiling a computer-related dictionary could not help me . 
  so , `` software '' ( read it in english ) stayed to this day . 
  no translation . 
  software . 
  ( yeah , i work in it ... ), 
  soup . 
  i 'm pretty sure most readers from other countries wo n't notice the sarcasm ... 
   do you honestly believe that sweden has the most sexual harassment in europe ? 
  or that danish men are the most violent towards women ? 
  by their own definitions of `` sexual harassment '' and `` violence '' , it appears so . 
  look , you define a man asking a woman out as sexual harassment ( see other comments ) . 
  then , i guess the only way for danes and swedes to avoid extinction is to engage in those abominable acts of sexual harassment . 
  do women there ask man out , to avoid the aforementioned problem ? 
  but , due to your excellent gender equality , is n't that also considered a crime ( sexual harassment ) ? 
  so many questions ... 
  so , `` inappropriate invitations '' = `` physical and sexual violence '' . 
  right ? 
   if you ask a woman to go out with you because she has a sweet ass and you want to tap that after dinner it 's fucking inappropriate . 
  i guess if you find her looks horrible and cringe at the thought of touching her , before of after any meal , then would be ok . 
  but wait a minute : remind me why are you inviting her , again ? 
  inviting her for her money , status or other anything-but-sexual things is appropriate , i hope ? 
  well , now that we mention it , it does sound sensible !, 
  i was wrong all these years , damn ... could be rich by now , who knows . 
  ^ ( til : if you find a woman attractive and ask her out you are a jerk . ), 
   it might surprise you but some people do n't get it . 
  no , because i do n't get it either ... 
  the 692 listed for portugal are no doubt the us garrison of the lajes airbase , or [ lajes field ] ( http://www.lajes.af.mil/units/index.asp ) , home of the 65th air base wing . 
  there was a nato headquarters also , but i think it moved to spain or something . 
  we are fighting tooth and nail to keep them , but apparently this once strategic airbase in the middle of the atlantic is n't necessary for the us anymore ... 
  so their number has been decreasing in the last few years , and the usa made it clear their idea is to remove all of them in the near term . 
  do people here support their presence ?
