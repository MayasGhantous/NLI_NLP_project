  i assumed birdwatchers would be careful about that and only photographed from afar . 
  perhaps not all are ... 
   the number of irish people with no religion - atheists and agnostics - increased by 400 percent in ireland between 1991 and 2011 to a total of 277,237 . 
  wikipedia says : population : 6,399,115 ( as of 2011 )  the massive increase i lol 'd . 
  why do you want to prevent _ other _ people taking photos ? 
  `` nest of intrigue '' , `` fierce rivalries '' , and stuff ? 
  it 's also the same in portuguese . 
  however , `` 2 weeks '' is also used and generally understood that is the same as `` quinze dias from today '' . 
  oh , and `` 1 week '' vs. `` 8 dias '' as well . 
  except for nitpickers , of course . 
  did n't know it was the same in spanish and italian , lol . 
  great , we 're between germany and the uk . 
  good company !, 
  hi , here in the most western european country what they say is the exact opposite : our qualified people have to emigrate . 
  no jobs here ... just sayin ', 
  well , exactly the same over here . 
  lol ? 
  til : in eu only 8 countries matter . 
  ( * ) this explains a lot ... ^ ( ( * ) ^ ) slovakia ^ appears ^ but ^ does n't ^ count , ^ nobody ^ asked ^ them ^ anything . 
  ^ and ^ only ^ czechs ^ remembered ^ they ^ exist ... 
  here we try hard to follow the example of our neighbour * hermanos * . 
  or so it seems . 
   you need to speak norwegian or possibly swedish for most ( not all ) positions though . 
  i knew there had to be a catch ... 
   the energy costs in portugal are ridiculously high !, 
  the edp company , that owns the energy monopoly , is run by a seemingly mobster type of fellow called antonio mexia , who raises prices indiscriminately and does n't care about the dire social situation . 
  there is something of that , but our electricity prices are essentially screwed for some decades to come due to some braindead strategic decisions made by the government ; they decided to `` go green '' with renewables ( wind turbines ) , which is in principle a wise direction , since we have no oil , coal or any other classical energy source ( nor money to build nuclear , even if we wanted to ) . 
  right ? 
  however , the devil is in the details , as they say . 
  wind turbines are n't economically viable today , so they have to be subsidised . 
  worse , the government agreed to * guarantee * an insane amount profit to edp ( and all others that came later , of course ) . 
  now , if these contracts were made in good faith , after 12-15 of use , the turbines are amortized and begin to compete with the other sources , right ? 
  after all , wind is free ... wrong !, 
  state subsidies are _ increasing _ , not diminishing . 
  current ( well ... i think ) european market price is 59 $ / mwh . 
  we pay 130 $ / mwh . 
  and will pay even more in the future , it 's already stated in the contracts . 
  they call it `` tariff deficit '' or something :-( ( there are other insane details to this sorry state of affairs , but i already wrote too much ; i apologise for the wall of text . ), 
  ok , i 'll bite : perro - c\u00e3o / cachorro ( * ) perrito/perrillo - c\u00e3ozinho / cachorrinho perrazo/perraco - c\u00e3ozarr\u00e3o / cachorr\u00e3o ( * ) perrucho - c\u00e3ozito / cachorrito and yes , hot dog - cachorro quente note the simplicity of the suffixes ;-) ( * ) `` cachorro '' is more used in brazil as `` dog '' ... 
  i think . 
  but it 's common usage here in portugal as well meaning `` young ( less than half a year old ) dog '', 
  i think the portuguese `` haver '' is almost exactly used as `` to have '' in english ( auxiliary verb , etc. ), 
  beyond that , your 2 first castilian examples also work with our `` haver '' . 
  if they spoke like in a tv show for kids , sure , no problem . 
  however , try to understand a normal conversation between spaniards . 
  it 's just too fast and furious :-) worse , some words sound the same , but do n't mean the same !, 
  i do have spanish relatives , but they speak galego and catal\u00e0 ... 
  does n't help ;-), 
  haha , i heard ( ca n't remember where ) that it sounds like a russian speaking french :-) otoh , the russians i know that live here have impeccable portuguese accents ( the various `` s '' and `` ch '' sounds come to mind as quite similar in both languages ) . 
  yes , it seems portuguese has an unusual amount of different sounds and that does help when i try to speak another language . 
  unless , of course , it 's spanish or dutch :-d just another fun fact : spanish and portuguese look very similar when written ... 
  however , speakers of both languages have a hard time understanding each other . 
  nowadays , it 's quite common to quickly give up and just use english ... 
  perhaps that portuguese is ranked 7th ( some say 5th ) in number of speakers worldwide ( 3rd european ) , or the 1st in the whole southern hemisphere ... and it is pretty much ignored in europe ( except in certain eu official documents , of course ) . 
  or so it seems to me , just sayin ' ... :-), 
  portuguese as well ( - inho/a ) . 
  look , the current russia president is a former colleague ( * ) of those guys . 
  i do n't find it strange at all ... ( * ) edit : `` successor '' is more appropriate , sorry, 
  3 - in the middle :-) 10 $ 00 = ten escudos ( not 10,00 $ nor $ 10,00 ), 
   the number of known prostitutes has quadrupled ( from 200.000 to 800.000 ) . 
  ftfy, 
  no , i do n't count that one . 
  :-( and neither `` west spain '' nor `` more spain '' qualify either ... 
  but wow , americans took this ? 
  i think 24/31 easily beats even europeans ... congrats . 
  well , glad you point out that angle : let 's call counting clouds `` art '' and suddenly not only you 'll find a client ( no comment pls :-) ) , but your employees are artists . 
  artists , you know , are socially highly valued everywhere . 
  ok , everybody does win after all :-] for cents an hour !, 
  i 'll give you this business plan for free , even . 
  wow . 
  you mean the german government subsidizes low wages ? 
  that would explain a lot then ... germany please , quit the euro . 
  we will see how far you will compete with us . 
  we have lower wages , work longer hours ... 
  you can , but why would you ? 
  what is your business plan in counting clouds ? 
  even at cents an hours , i bet you will be losing those cents ... 
  but from a social point of view , perhaps your idea has some merit : the government would be paying those guys in welfare assistance to the unemployed anyway , and they get to have their dignity back . 
  people will find you a magnanimous benefactor . 
  everyone wins !, 
  except the economy , of course . 
  you 're producing exactly nothing ... 
  well , it 's really shitty demagoguery then : i already had a 5h/week work hours increase , a direct 10 % salary decrease ( * ) ( an additional 14 % was foiled this year , but had it in 2012 ) , a ton of `` extraordinary '' taxes , and suffered all the other `` troika '' instructions our government is sweating to apply . 
  ( * ) yes , i work for the state . 
  not exactly the kind of demagoguery that wins you a lot of votes , you know ? 
  the only `` reform '' europe expects from us is to lower the salaries ( to compete again with vietnam , i presume ) and pensions ( this is unfortunately necessary anyway , i gather ) . 
  already well under way ... 
  i agree there would be other much more meaningful and useful reforms , like reducing state burocracy , making courts and justice work , stopping corruption ... 
  but hey , we 'll do as eu wants instead . 
  eu ( and germany is seen as the main culprit ) is losing goodwill here fast , i 'm afraid . 
  we just came out of recession ( technically ) , and unemployment is lower -- but still above 15 % -- and exports are growing 10 % ... to countries outside eu , mainly . 
  all in all , this euro and eu thing looks like not that good a deal as we thought , in hindsight : yes , they lent 78000me in a time of trouble , but they 'll collect 41000m in interest alone . 
  oh , and of course the 78000m have to be repaid starting next year , iirc . 
  congratulations for ireland !, 
  we 're next in line , 6 months after that . 
  ^ fingers ^ crossed ... 
  eerily similar to portugal . 
  :-( with the difference we have no dedicated agency to fight corruption . 
   for some bloody reason never annexed the portuguese as opposed to the other  areas previously mentioned . 
  i think `` bloody '' is quite right here .
