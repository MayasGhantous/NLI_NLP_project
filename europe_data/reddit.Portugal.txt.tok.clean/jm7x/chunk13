  literally ... [ wikipedia : spanish -- portuguese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:portugal%e2%80%93spain_relations ) yes , they did try several times for  600 years now . 
  for 60 ( 1580-1640 ) they even succeeded . 
  but for the last 200 we 've been mostly friends :-), 
   you ca n't write off the problem as `` europe is declining , the east is rising '' . 
  of course i can . 
  just the facts , dude . 
   the eurozone has a net positive trade balance and full sufficiency in terms of  food , ( although energy not so much ) . 
  ... so far . 
  the problem is the insufficient growth . 
  seems it will not cope with aging populations and other social disasters wainting to happen . 
   your argument here basically is `` there is a crisis , i see you respond without even reading anything i wrote . 
  no , my thesis is that there is n't a crisis , this is how things are going to be if some trends are n't reverses . 
   therefore my explanation is the correct one '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but logic simply  does n't work that way . 
  yes , you should be ( logically ) sorry . 
   the problem is that there 's enough to cover the basics for everyone ,  yet there 's a ton of people who have to live without them . 
  true . 
  inequality only worsens the problem . 
  even there was enough for everyone , there would be too many poor people . 
  at least around here ...  i do n't really buy that explanation . 
  china 's export model , for  instance , is completely dependent on the west 's consumerist model . 
  this spells big trouble in the not so far future . 
  just look at the growth of china and of europe countries this century . 
  worrying , is n't it ? 
  exports depend on the buyers having money . 
  lending the money for the buyer of our products can afford to continue buying from us is n't a good long term strategy ... 
  if europe continues this last decade trend , china is going to hit a wall . 
  then , i can not predict what sorts of troubles will arise . 
  i do hope they find other markets as good as europe , soon . 
  really . 
  oh , and i did n't even mention india , did i ? 
  oil countries can simply ease the price as needed to at least suck money at current levels ; nobody seems to afford to go to an oil-free economy just yet . 
  or in the near future . 
  back to europe : without industry , i ca n't where money will come from . 
  remember , ip , software , entertainment , tourism and other services are all good , but people need to eat and buy real goods . 
  goods that only agriculture and industry can produce . 
  without those , europe wo n't go far . 
  proof is the current state of affairs , which , i repeat , people think it 's a temporary crisis . 
  but i 'm afraid it 's not , it is structural . 
  look , even germany is struggling to grow . 
  and we all agree it 's the country in best shape here ... at least among those without oil , that is . 
  please note that i did n't speak about the euro project . 
  no need to , it is n't the cause of anything i mentioned ... ok , if the ecb starts churning out euros as the usa prints dollars , we might ( just might ) fool exporters a little longer -- until they realize they 're working for useless piles of paper ... and you ca n't eat paper . 
  i suppose we could sell portugal to china as a giant holidays resort . 
  or another small country they might like better , idk . 
  mmm ... 
  i see some business opportunities like these in europe 's future . 
   our production capacity is more than enough to cover everyone 's needs the key point here is `` needs '' . 
  as currently defined by marketing and consumerism , no : europe 's industrial capacity is n't `` enough '' today . 
  remember that most european industry corporations already moved their factories elsewhere . 
  and they are not moving them back for now . 
  surely it is still enough to live better than , say , in somalia . 
  but that is not we are selling to our own people anyway . 
  this ( letting industry disappear from europe ) is one of the main causes of the current `` crisis '' , which is n't really a crisis . 
  it 's how it 's going to be from now on : a decaying europe and a dominant asia ( + america ? 
  who knows ... ) . 
  if you are wondering , the other great cause is the price of energy : oil and gas , mainly . 
  your country is an oil producer ? 
  you are blessed ... 
   turin , portugal ; sorry , no city with that name here in portugal . 
  i know one with a similar sounding name in italy , but ... makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of the article . 
  look , it 's heavily taxed , therefore expensive ( * ) . 
  always was a rich people 's luxury here . 
  ( * ) even if other europeans would find it cheap , i guess . 
   dropped two percentage points well , literally , it 's a negative change ... :-), 
  do n't know what you mean , we 're above bulgaria and hungary in this `` championship '' ... 
  however , future looks bleak . 
  that 's why from last study we 've gone 73th -  85th place ( -0.5 ) . 
  perhaps a more perspective with more objective numbers : total population ( 2011 ) : 10562178 ( * ) 2012 : 89841 born . 
  107598 died . 
  121418 emigrated . 
  ( ref : http://www.pordata.pt/portugal ) ( * ) the rest live abroad , of course . 
  except in north korea , i think ; yes , some scientists in antarctica , if they count . 
  note how 121418 voted with their feet . 
  and the rest feel reluctant to bring more children over here . 
  for a wealthy foreigner , on the other hand , i guess it looks like a nice place . 
  ok , found it : http://unsdsn.org/happiness/ http://issuu.com/earthinstitute/docs/worldhappinessreport2013_online http://unsdsn.org/files/2013/09/worldhappinessreport2013_online.pdf, 
  nope , that 's the one from 2012 . 
  2012-04-02 to be exact . 
  that 's why the title says `` first world happiness report '' ... 
  the news are about the second :-) now , if anybody could help : i ca n't find the damn thing anywhere online ... 
  over 200 fires _ a day _ over august . 
  some days over 350 . 
  4 firefighters dead . 
  2 men , 2 women , all volunteers , i think . 
  cheers to them . 
  and it is probably a `` good year '' in statistical terms , since it rained constantly until july , which is not common at all . 
   treat meat eaters like smokers a final solution is in the works for all those * untermenschen * . 
  ( however , the article only mentions `` meat '' and `` tobacco '' , not `` meat eaters '' nor `` smokers '' ), 
  we 're talking about the island inhabitants , of course . 
  or ... not . 
  cool !, 
  a little surprised that the iberian peninsula remains essentially unchanged in all scenarios . 
  yes . 
  filling space left after the parliament election campaign . 
  but nobody really cares . 
  thousands of km away , and we already agreed to house some thousands , so , case closed it seems . 
  national dress of the [ republic of french stereotypes ] ( http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/republic_of_french_stereotypes ) . 
  there 's a party here currently campaigning exactly that for next month elections . 
  and it 's one of the favourites in the polls .
