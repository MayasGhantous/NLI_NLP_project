  instead , spain and portugal are probably closest today than most other eu countries . 
  even more since both entered the ( then ) eec . 
  the graph for portugal is totally different from those in the op . 
  it 's a flat line until 2009 , then it dips sharply , only rises again in 2012 . 
  no boom ; yet , we still managed to bust . 
  now , and this is the biggie , ** the end point is lower than the initial ** , and that 's the biggest difference to all those other countries . 
  including greece . 
  yes , greece 's gdp is now bigger than in 1999 !, 
  i do n't know what are they complaining about ... 
  yet , here i only hear sympathy and words of comfort towards greece . 
  nobody gives a damn about the portuguese living ** worse ** today ( check the gdp ... ) than before the euro . 
  no problem , we are used to it . 
  carry on . 
  `` praia das ma\u00e7\u00e3s '' = = `` apples beach '' . 
  `` praia das macas '' = = `` stretcher beach '' . 
  this last version is funnier , i think : \u00ba ) come visit us again !, 
  many places to go , much to see and enjoy , and everybody is welcome :-), 
  elected by 4 people , then ? 
  the name of the show does n't help either ... 
  [ wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seafood#consumption ) `` iceland , japan , and portugal are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world . '', 
  more precisely , portugal is 2nd ( yes , ahead of japan ) , but ca n't find the url of that table right now . 
  that 's cheating , they put all the meat on top . 
  that 's a three-dimensional dish , son . 
  there 's cabbage , rice , potatoes and turnip below . 
  in some regions , several types of beans also . 
  not mentioning the herbs , of course . 
  bring a big belly , you 'll need it . 
  i 'd say it 's the best known cure for vegetarianism * ( apologies to jeremy clarkson ) * . 
   garoupa grouper . 
  but really , sardine and mackerel are the most popular fishes . 
  me too , unless they insist in speaking portuguese . 
  sorry , ca n't speak much spanish . 
  and most people here that think they know spanish are horribly wrong . 
  having many common words does that : unfortunately many of them have totally different meanings ... 
  perhaps english vs. dutch ... ? 
  actually slovenia overtook portugal since the euro . 
  yes , you are richer now . 
  : - } portugal 's median income stands more or less the same now in relation with eu average as ... 
  when it became member of eec in 1985 , at less than 70 % . 
  30 whole years to get to square one . 
  well , not really : eu is much richer now than 30 years ago , surely . 
  and someone has to be the worst , even in the finest team . 
  fortunately , jobs there pay a lot more . 
  that 's why people go there to work in the first place ... 
  you can move to another , not so crazy , place . 
  right ? 
   the sticking point was the size and purpose of a privatisation fund to be backed by sequestered greek assets . 
  ms merkel wanted the $ 50bn of sales to be devoted to debt repayments ; mr tsipras saw that as a national humiliation that would cede control of assets worth almost a third of greek national income . 
  his alternative was a smaller fund , whose proceeds would be reinvested in greece . 
    a compromise was ultimately found after more than an hour discussing nearly a dozen different structures . 
  i 'm proud to say that in the end it was a portuguese suggestion the chosen solution for this particular point . 
  same for portugal . 
   they have superior * free * health care * coverage * than the us ftfy, 
  sovereignty was lost loan after loan . 
  perhaps that path could have been put to referendum beforehand ? 
  and i 'm not just talking about greece . 
  the beauty of a single currency is that an euro in greece is an euro anywhere else . 
  just fucking stop this `` cost of living '' slogan . 
  so , romanians are richer than greeks because of it ? 
  did you compare price indices to conclude that 150 $ in romania is worth more than 1000 in greece ? 
  if a fridge and a tv gets you a 150 $ / month power bill , you are crazy to pay that much to the utility company . 
  here i pay 60-70 and our electricity prices are among the highest in europe ( yeah , we can talk about `` cost of living '' in portugal also ) . 
  if your `` cost of living '' is too expensive , that 's an indication that you are all rich , normally . 
  which in this case goes against your agenda . 
  so , just stop . 
  is the treaty of versailles after ww1 really a good example of clemency towards germany ? 
  do n't care , we 're ahead anyway . 
  til , thanks . 
  yes , goe is a police unit . 
  and in such particular incident as that one , to have a heavily armed police unit is a must :-[, 
  it must be said this approach varies wildly among countries . 
  the ones that arm police ( e.g. 
  in my country ) probably take into account that criminals do not usually follow guns control laws too strictly . 
  here , to wear a gun in the street , there 's two ways : either you 're the police or you 're a criminal ( you 'll be arrested just for being in possession of a firearm ) . 
  it works [ remarkably well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ) . 
  at least we 're just ahead of you in this particular index . 
  only takes one bullet to stop a single man . 
  no need for a full military operation . 
  i 'm sure it is , but it must be quite sizeable to even make a dent on the current debt . 
  if that was the case now , this megathread would not exist . 
   or if the person owning the loan has no option to force greece to pay if they cant/dont want to . 
  at first sight they do , since greece wants * more * money . 
  so , they say , they can pay back the previous loans . 
  however ... 
  i suspect the creditors now understood that greece never meant to pay back anything from the start ; only an inflow of cash bigger than the necessary paybacks . 
  coupled by a convenient timing , of course . 
  what is interesting is what are the creditors going to do now . 
  their situation reminds me of someone who invested their savings in what they suddenly find to be a ponzi scheme . 
  some breivik can come out of nowhere , perhaps ? 
  well , not for us that had to produce proof of our expenses for our employers : - } but yeah , without automation , flat rate was always the best way to deal small * services * businesses taxes . 
  i mean a taxi or a barber shop ( but not a kiosk ) , e.g. 
  for the lazy to click , the prizes here are audis ( a4 and a6 ) . 
  we like to help our german eu brothers . 
  i last visited greece in 1993 ( or thereabouts ) . 
  it surprises me that the same problem with the receipts remains . 
  a colleague tried to get one for a taxi ride and i got to see for the first and last time in my life a receipt written on the back of an envelope . 
  literally . 
  i 'm lying . 
  not really surprised . 
  i begin to suspect they are following those examples .
