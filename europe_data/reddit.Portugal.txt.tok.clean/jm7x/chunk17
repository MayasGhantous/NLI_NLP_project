  * why am i writing this silly comment ? 
  oh ok , no worries :-), 
  `` raising your kids '' above your head could be construed as assault and purposeful endangerment , i wonder ? ... 
  do n't try it then . 
  that must be illegal in sweden . 
  so , any method that is legal there , if you please ? 
  well of course that is n't the case . 
  my signature could be '' / s '' , and was showing my disagreement with / u/poloport . 
  i still do n't know many spanish words , though . 
  gestures work surprisingly well , in a pinch . 
  i suppose an argentinian is also allowed ... ? - ) ( you can talk spanish to me . 
  be aware i do n't know many spanish words , though . ), 
  how do you put the little pests in line then ? 
  or do you just contract a civil responsibility insurance and let them rampage ? 
  always . 
  those types of coffee with any amount of milk are for breakfast use only . 
  strange , i thought you used the right side for passing , as you do for vehicles ... you do these things just to confuse the continentals , right ? 
  how can i get access to these riches ?

  now expecting the french coin commemorating the 200th anniversary of the battle of waterloo , 2015 . 
   lesbian sex rarely results in pregnancy irrelevant . 
  in case you did n't know : a single man can father several children at any one time . 
  the number of women is what 's determinant to continue the species . 
  biologically , men are much less valuable . 
  dangerous jobs always had been `` sexist '' in all history ( and certainly before ) because of this . 
  it 's just survival sense to send men instead of women to eventually die , there 's plenty of men around . 
  you can ascribe to this all cultural and philosophic debates you want , but please remember the basic reason . 
  portugal is in western europe . 
  balance restored !, 
  there 's a tie between portugal , greece , cyprus and hungary for that highly disputed 2nd place , all with 6.2 . 
  croatia comes next with 6.3 . 
  serbia is n't represented ... 
  wait , what ? 
  this policy now including homosexual couples as well !, 
  * payoffs intensify *, 
  * however , it 's all relative . 
  when are pensions `` high '' ? 
  when is gdp `` low '' ? 
  does this chart matter at all ? 
  * these , and other questions will be answered in a series of fine , intelligent comments . 
  i '' ll just see myself out .

  you got that backwards . 
  in a more serious note : it is just one of those gifts that heads of state give to each other during visits which have a symbolic meaning . 
  a keen eye can spot all of them laughing . 
  beware when russia likes you ... ? 
  yes , cows !, 
  cows everywhere !, 
  * many settlers were flemish ( seen those ancient windmills ? ) . 
  i wonder if there 's some connection ... * ;-) the azorean cheeses i know are all cow 's - milk . 
  but i do remember seeing goats in some * faj\u00e3 * * ( sorry , ca n't translate this -- neither google translate , it seems ) * . 
  and food . 
  did you try the fish ? 
  cheese ? 
  beef ? 
  oh sorry , you 're swede . 
  my mistake . 
  i did !, 
  and you forgot the rhine !, 
  well , it is cheap now . 
  but i understand your concern . 
  do n't worry , no way to have mass tourism there . 
  distance and type of place alone selects the people who might want to go ... also , no nightclubs , no disneyland , no eiffel towers ... ;-), 
  i got to visit 8 of the 9 islands ( in two separate trips ) . 
  could n't get to corvo ( the smallest ) because that day a storm shut both the plane and the boat from flores . 
  well , now that easyjet and ryanair fly to ponta delgada , i think i 'll return there . 
  every island has something different i remember . 
  e.g. , santa maria , featured in the article , has a nice feature : climb to the ( only ) mountain in a clear day and from the top you 'll clearly see you 're in an island ... 
  there 's sea all around !, 
  they say it 's the only place in azores you get such a view ( well , i guess the same is possible in corvo , but that 's like cheating : it 's such a small island ... ) . 
  neither of them did anything `` illegal '' , they just cheated . 
  and eu just turned a blind eye and accepted it . 
  probably should n't have , perhaps ? 
  after the troika , we are left with 8 . 
  2/7 of them will fall on a weekend on average ... 
  well , formally speaking , even if there were more culprits , the first question does mention one of them . 
  the point is goldman sachs ca n't just say `` hey , those guys hired me to cheat , i 'm not a cheater '' . 
  beats me . 
  many years ago , as a kid , i 'd watch just to see if my country got any points from france or spain . 
  i remember a year we finished 7th , quite a record !!, 
  now , even that mild interest is n't there , since we do n't ever get to the `` finals '' . 
  oh , btw the music is appalling . 
  there were like a dozen songs that were any good ... 
  in about 60 years of competition . 
  `` silly '' was the defining word . 
  so much fun !, 
  ( of course , adults ca n't have silly things . 
  they are too important for those . ), 
  lol rtp 's el\u00e1dio cl\u00edmaco participating as a player ... 
  i wish i had seen this episode then . 
  answering your question : we kids that loved it grew up , and today 's kids probably struggle to understand games like those , with real people instead of cartoons , etc. 
  americans do have `` wipeout '' , though . 
  it can work , sort of . 
  i gather that party is n't part of current government , though ? 
  that seems a significant difference in political speech . 
  yes , of course . 
  and you will be convicted as well . 
  lisbon without gulf stream = = climate of new york .
