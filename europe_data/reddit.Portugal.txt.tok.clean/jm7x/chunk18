  as a portuguese citizen , i say exactly the same . 
  those pictures ca n't be of actual voting places ; surely they 're from some outside waiting/information room ? 
   johansson went on to say : `` i think that every party that wants to call itself feminist must also be involved to tear away this glass ceiling [ on female advancement in the workplace ] - otherwise it will be just empty words . '' since the government proudly classifies itself as `` feminist '' , i guess this is all the rage in swede politics now ? 
  any party suspect of not being `` feminist '' does n't get the votes ? 
  i recently read an interesting article about these sexist politics in a portuguese newspaper ( article sponsored by the swedish government , who paid all travelling expenses ) . 
  apparently , sweden lags at 4th place worldwide in `` gender equality '' ( ca n't find the source for this , or what they measure ) . 
  they apparently feel they are n't doing enough in this respect . 
  but `` gender equality '' = = `` feminism '' , it seems . 
  other curious topic was the invite to visit stockholm : `` half of the population is single , you may easily find a partner/spouse here '' or something to that effect . 
  odd they did n't provide an explanation to such alarming stat . 
  perhaps half the population is under 25 , or some other great number . 
  * many * *, 
  no need to go that far . 
  sending him here would suffice . 
  there 's the obvious suspicion that law making * may * be influenced by rich people . 
  but that could n't happen in democracy , right ? 
  ^ ( * ahem * ) probably there 's a way to make such laws really work for everyone . 
  but , short of outlawing corporations , offshore accounts , and essentially most modern finance constructs , i ca n't see how . 
  could you please point me to an example of a country who does that well ? 
  an inheritance law that really taxes the big fortunes ? 
  i see . 
  content is a complicated javascript ... arcgis and stuff , no less !, 
  left the tab open since yesterday , but apparently that 's not enough . 
  any idea on the eta ? 
  how it worked in portugal and why the law was revoked : * if you had your own business , owned a house or anything in your name and you died : all that was taxed ( ca n't remember the rate , but it was like 30 % or more ) . 
  * if you had real money , factories , owned corporations , shares , etc. 
  : of course none of that was in your name , because you had created a company/corporation for that effect , say giving 1 % to another partner would suffice . 
  not only no inheritance taxes when you died , but in fact there were several fiscal benefits for the people who got the company then ... 
  guess who . 
  so , no real money from big fortunes ; small proprietors were effectively discouraged . 
  in total , not much revenue for the state . 
  so , some years ago that law was revoked . 
  i 'm sure the `` fat cats '' do n't mind at all laws like these . 
  they may even vote for them , as they spread inequality . 
  i guess that 's what op was talking about . 
  quite surprisingly , i can quote [ demographic projections until 2060 ] ( https://www.ine.pt/ngt_server/attachfileu.jsp?look_parentboui=215593684&amp;att_display=n&amp;att_download=y ) ( national statistics institute ) that already allow us to foresee some facets of that future portugal . 
  where do i begin ? 
  let 's see : * population diminishes from 2012 's 10.5 m to 8.6 m. 
  * people age : from 131 old per 100 young in 2012 to ** 307 ** old per 100 young . 
  * sustainability : 340 active age ( 15-64 ) people per 100 ( not great , 2012 ) to ** 149 ** per 100 old . 
  this is the `` central '' scenario , the `` pessimistic '' scenario is much worse . 
  oh , and there 's some assumptions , like migration balances reverting to positive somehow , i think are just overly optimistic ... what may this mean in 30 years time ? 
  - gnp decreased to 3rd world levels ; - welfare state disappeared along the way ; - probably got kicked from euro due to above described problems crashing the whole economy ; - emigration almost stopped . 
  old people are n't accepted as workers ... - young people only know portuguese as a second/third language ; though probably still in use for some official purposes ; - foreigners own most of land , buildings and all major businesses ; i could go on all night . 
  but i 'm already too depressed , sorry . 
  that page loads blank for me . 
  what did i miss ? 
  better than reverting to old `` bohemia-moravia '' , anyway . 
  but i 'm not english ; i have no vote here . 
  ^ ( in portuguese , can i call it * ch\u00e9quia * ? 
  or * tch\u00e9quia * ? ), 
  there 's something strange about these numbers if we are talking about asylum seekers : portugal received 155 requests in 2014 . 
  40 were granted . 
  in total . 
  with a 14 % unemployment rate , it 's not a very appealing destination for regular migrants either . 
  ca n't read german , so do n't know if i got the labels right : this says that to be fair , eu should exile some 8200 poor souls to portugal ? 
  bet they would flee in short order . 
  probably what already happened to those 445 . 
  they probably do n't ; never seen that particular brand . 
  * ( and i do like canned sardines . 
  fresh ones , even more . 
  interesting . 
  at $ 35.3 , we are below greece , but still a little above czech republic . 
  * and the gdp per head has been rising for many years now . 
  the problem seems to be the falling population * : - }, 
  perhaps the attitude towards europe . 
  10 years ago , we thought that being in eu and in the euro meant we would soon be as rich and developed as the rest of eu . 
  then , these 10 years happened . 
  reality crashed in , and now we realise how silly those hopes look now . 
  most importantly , the standards of living had a significant decrease . 
  and the next 10 years do n't offer a bright outlook . 
  and as we say , the light at the end of the tunnel might just be an incoming train . 
  so , no changes at all ? 
  1000 $ exceeds the median wage here . 
  i can see why : a ) africans do n't come here ( who would ? ), 
  b ) people here emigrate there . 
  well , at least in sri lanka the biggest reason was you brought an army of some 2000 strong , and the portuguese garrison at columbo was rather outnumbered . 
  the siege did take some time , however ( 1652-1656 ) . 
  it is said that the dutch were a bit surprised when it was over , as only 78 men , including the 80 years old captain , left the fortress following surrender terms . 
  let me stop you right there mister !, 
  first , you are a nordic , so you are n't allowed any amount of self-deprecation or self-commiseration . 
  let that for the professionals like the portuguese . 
  second , you know what `` stereotype '' means , right ? 
  so , we agree those things are not really true , just a known legend . 
  third , be warned that a mob of finnish girls is gathering right now to get you . 
  run !, 
  ps : all european girls are beautiful . 
  some more than others ... 
  in any country . 
  so there . 
  * these are n't the nordic girls you 're looking for * * -- says he while waving his hands in a jedi way * i do n't see how finnish girls are inferior . 
  blondes , check ; and everything , check . 
  could you please explain ? 
  have they a dark secret we only find when it 's too late and then you disappear in a hazy mist ? 
  if so , you could save thousands from a gloomy destiny !, 
  thousands !, 
  speak up !, 
  that 's why the term `` bailout '' was used . 
  loans to pay for other loans . 
  those 10 % were probably other obligations , like salaries and pensions ...
