  but i guess that 's alright : nobody would understand it but portuguese speakers anyway ... 
  well , you are right , as the article explains :  because it is a suspension bridge and has similar coloring , it is often compared to the golden gate bridge in san francisco , usa . 
  in fact , it was built by the same company ( american bridge company ) that constructed the san francisco -- oakland bay bridge and not the golden gate , also explaining its similarity in design . 
  thanks for making clear that portugal is eastern europe . 
  the map is clearly wrong . 
  there we are , messing up the map colours again ... 
  damn `` something good european index '' maps . 
  we never fit . 
  interesting . 
  so , the top 10 % in portugal fare worse than the bottom 10 % of poland . 
  for the defined meaning of `` worse '' , whatever it may be , of course . 
  what i like is that we 're ahead of brasil , loool . 
  summarizing all these `` something good european index map '' posts for my country : we really should relocate to the russian or turkey border , we 're always messing up the colours here . 
  many of the biggest ( formerly ) portuguese companies are now based in the netherlands . 
  even if i strongly suspect many of them do n't have any businesses there at all ... 
  besides a p.o. 
  box . 
  natural gas . 
  it 's almost as good as oil !, 
  no it is n't , sorry . 
  just check portugal vs. , say , spain . 
  in this context it 's not clear if we are talking about women 's married status ( like you suggest ) , or about the household being composed of a single female alone . 
  i 'm surprised by such low numbers here , with all those old widows living alone . 
  but they are surely increasing : the life expectancy gap that favours women is . 
  i guess the map is roughly equivalent to the `` ageing population '' one ... ? 
  wait , are you saying that `` nathan '' and `` ellen '' are n't english translations for this map , but actual and literal names french parents give to their sons and daughters ? 
  please tell me i got it wrong . 
  rodrigo and martim at least ( santiago had a more castilla influence ) are the most traditional you can find , pre-independence even . 
  i 'm talking xi century traditional here . 
  ps : `` martins '' as a surname meant `` son of martim '' , i think . 
  the effects were [ like this ] ( http://youtu.be/avnjtqdxfhq ) . 
  quite the thunderstorm ... 
  thought that dutch was a requirement for netherlands citizenship ? 
  i guess he is under 18 , right ? 
  tell him he 'll regret it ... 
  think of all those dutch girls . 
  crazy !, 
   i do n't think there 's history moments that are swept under the rug ca n't really say if `` moments '' apply , but some things like creating the whole modern-era ( i.e. 
  post-roman ) slave market from africa to europe and america were never really - * ahem * - emphasized in our schools . 
  not our finest idea by today 's standards . 
  but it did shape the ethnic content of those continents today . 
  here , it does grant you citizenship if at 18 you opt for it instead of your parent 's . 
  * edit : a word, 
  not really : it was also quite boring before leaving . 
  ** portugal : ** * no national football team coach ( paulo bento was sacked last week ) * less people . 
  more deaths than births , more emigrants than immigrants . 
  * this is n't news , it 's just a reminder that it happens every week for years now , so we wo n't have to repeat it . 
  * so , nothing new and relevant , as is lately usual . 
  i like how our tiny blob still gets historically accurate flags , coat of arms and all . 
  that 's attention to detail . 
  probably . 
  here , a small shop has an upfront cost and a monthly pay to have the pos terminal , and a fee for each transaction . 
  a few cents in a few $ sale can amount to a  10 % overhead for them , which is obviously too much . 
  ... and change in small coins !, 
  extra cost in cashiers time . 
  we had quite a few famous sailors in the xv-xvii centuries . 
  trying to not bore the distinct audience , here are just the highlights , in no particular order : - fern\u00e3o de magalh\u00e3es - vasco da gama - pedro \u00c1lvares cabral - [ these and others ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:portuguese_explorers ) there were even some [ pirates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:portuguese_pirates ) ; however , our navy is more known to chase pirates ( * ) than to use them . 
  ( * ) e.g. , dutch pirates ;-) somalia , present day , also comes to mind . 
  using strict terms , a [ confederation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation ) should be enough for what you describe , although apparently [ some think eu is more of a federation now ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation#european_union ) . 
  citing the wikipedia entry :  thomas risse and tanja a. b\u00f6rzel claim that the `` eu only lacks two significant features of a federation . 
  first , the member states remain the ` masters ' of the treaties , i.e. , they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the eu . 
  second , the eu lacks a real ` tax and spend ' capacity , in other words , there is no fiscal federalism . '', 
  in other words , tax money in europe is still owned and spent by each country -- the eu budget is residual . 
  this is where you see a real difference to a federation , like the usa . 
  the federal budget is not only a thing there ... 
  it 's the real stuff :-) so , answering op : no , i do n't see that happening in my lifetime . 
  there is too much difference between rich and poor eu members . 
  the rich wo n't allow the simple transfer of money to the poor much beyond the current eu budget for development programs . 
  however , other things may be achieved more rapidly , i think : - united armed forces . 
  this will be quickly needed ( as in `` now '' ? ) . 
  perhaps under some existing efforts , like nato ... 
  but really , it 's the only sane solution . 
  - a single foreign office . 
  really needed to end this alarmingly confusing state of affairs . 
  see `` the ukraine files '' if you do n't believe me . 
  ca n't really come up with more examples , i 'm afraid . 
  well , here that 's only in theory : most small shops only accept a debit card for amounts over like 20 $ . 
  the centralized * multibanco * fees become quite heavy for small transactions . 
  i all other occasions , people pay with debit card . 
  few uses for cash or credit cards . 
  the castle , man !, 
  and many other things you just do n't see because you pass them by everyday ... leiria is wonderful . 
  i should probably say i had the same problem about my hometown , lisbon . 
  but i wo n't . 
  i think it 's the best place to visit and live in the known universe . 
  so there . 
  thanks for the link , it 's quite interesting . 
  : ukraine has far more tourist arrivals than greece , and equals austria ? 
  wtf ? 
  ( 2013 stats , before you ask . ), 
  also , turkey is # 4 in europe and # 6 worldwide . 
  i guess they do n't need american tourists to do well ...  - ) and to answer the oc , i think the simple fact that the 2 nearest countries happen to be # 2 and # 1 on the top european tourist destinations and # 3 / # 1 ** worldwide ** explains it quite nicely . 
  i europe , we 're ( [ 2013 wto ] ( http://www.e-unwto.org/content/r13521/fulltext.pdf ) ) : # 16 in tourist arrivals ( 8324000 ) and # 12 ( ? ), 
  in receipts ( $ us 12,284 millions ) we do have some tourists , but it 's hard to compete with france and particularly spain , which also happens to be our only neighbour ... 
  i ca n't believe / u/actimeliano did n't mention the [ food ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_cuisine ) !, 
  beyond the [ past\u00e9is de nata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastel_de_nata ) you mentioned , there 's the ( many types of ) fish , table wines , [ cheeses ] ( http://www.cheese.com/by_country/?c=pt ) ... and much more . 
  the two most usual drawbacks portuguese emigrants point out about being abroad are : 1 . 
  being away from their family 1 . 
  the food ... 
  it 's perhaps fair to warn people who like to eat : i guess a trip to portugal is n't recommended if you 're trying to lose weight ...
