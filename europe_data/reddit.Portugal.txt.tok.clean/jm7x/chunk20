  almost british funny . 
  ( portugal could n't afford it and had to cancel it in 2012 . 
  after spending over 100 million $ in developing the damn thing :-( ), 
  what ? 
  that ca n't be right . 
  our esquadra 501 has 6 c-130h ( 1st bought in 1977 , all still in service apparently ) ... 
  i ca n't understand how can you break a beast of a plane like that . 
  jeez ... 
  the article mentions the transall c-160 instead : `` the equipment shortage was made plain in a defence inspectors ' report last year that showed only 24 out of 43 transall c-160 transport planes were operational . '', 
  yeah , it does n't seem too reliable . 
  perhaps the one that broke was one of these ? 
  it seemed mad to me too , until i read in this article that 21 people were able to document that their ancestors did live here over 500 years ago and were willing to take portuguese citizenship because of that . 
  `` from as far afield as panama , australia and china '' , no less . 
  come on , how can you refuse them ... after all , [ this is n't exactly the promised land ] ( / r/europe/comments / 2xw908/the _ 15_most_miserable_economies_in_the_world_pigs / ) . 
  i agree !, 
  go away dear fascist . 
  go do your non-smoking or whatever else you do for your pleasure in your free time . 
  why ? 
  ok , this font i 'm using does not separate '' \u0103 '' from '' \u00e3 '' too well , which confused me . 
  seen the proper character , is quite different from '' ~ a '' -  '' \u00e3 '' . 
   excuse me ? 
  equality and personal freedom is backwards and patriarchal ? 
  not that part , but simply to suggest women could freely make different life choices than men if they could . 
  that 's a no-go for feminist speech . 
  and , you know , all the rest you said , i 'm afraid . 
  like men not having wombs and other fascist stuff like that . 
  otoh , i agree 100 % with you ... we 're dinosaurs , i fear . 
  i 'm pretty sure all that passed the eu official food regulations , so it may be technically edible . 
  i still would have to be pretty famished to even look at it again . 
  look , i 'm no feminist , but your views are clearly anti-feminist . 
  i 'm not saying i do n't share them , just that your thinking is nowadays considered backwards and patriarchal . 
  politically incorrect , to sum up . 
  yeah , i know what you mean , but there it goes . 
  e.g. , about children : it is now pushed the idea that children should be raised equally by the father and the mother ( or other , like homosexual , combinations ) . 
  so , no excuses for differences in the labour market there . 
  portuguese women have very few children today ( again , a revolution in just one generation ) simply because they are a financial liability ( and more work over the incredibly long hours in job , and the ones you mentioned ) . 
  as most do , if you do well in life , you risk having one . 
  and that 's all . 
  nobody wants to have children like their fathers and grandfathers , they ca n't help in the farm anymore : there are no farms . 
   portuguese sounds very different when spoken by women ( very sexy ) than it does when spoken by men ( let 's just say , less pleasant :p ) . 
  to me , this happens with all languages . 
  weird , right ? 
  i had to read twice your response on horrible sexist conditions , because i thought you were talking about portugal , and that would only be adequate if portugal was in the place of the netherlands in the infographic . 
  so , it shows near equality between the sexes in portugal and horrible inequality in netherlands . 
  is that due to the cultural differences you talk about ? 
  you must change things then , that mentality is not acceptable today ... 
  in fact , i keep hearing that gender equality is so superior in north/luteran/rich / working/honest countries ... and this shatters all that . 
  ( of course , i know that in a single generation there was a complete revolution in the labour market * and mentalities * here . ), 
  now , back to my point : compare what a dutch receives at the end of the month in a half-time median job , with what a portuguese does ** in a full-time top job ** . 
  yeah , right ? 
  there are also different laws and regulations that make part-time jobs hidden under `` private outsourcing and consultancy '' , and other dirty tricks that may explain the apparent low numbers for portugal . 
  but i understand the * economist * bias : these articles are written comparing a few selected countries in the mind of the writer . 
  portugal is never one of them ( * ) . 
  i do n't know why they included so many countries in the graph ... perhaps to give it a credible number of data points ? 
  ( \\* ) except the articles written specifically about ( to bash ) portugal . 
  for * the economist * that is easy and frequent anyway . 
  \u0103\u0103\u0103 ... 
  so i guess we hum it the same way :-) ( funny , did n't know romanian used the ~ ), 
  same !, 
  only , we 'd write it '' \u00e3\u00e3\u00e3 '' . 
  which country/language ? 
   ( ... ) instead , he reckons the high prevalence of part-time jobs is largely down to the wide availability of good quality , well-paid `` first tier '' part-time jobs in the netherlands : jobs often considered inferior in many other countries . 
  ca n't understand anything in this phrase : it does not make any sense to me . 
  as to the `` why '' , the article is certainly very weak :  part of the reason is that dutch women were relative latecomers to the labour market . 
  compared with other countries , few men had to leave to fight in the world wars of the 20th century , with the result that women did not labour in factories as they did in america and britain . 
  ok , then explain the enormous difference in the infographic between netherlands and portugal . 
  i think the true reason lies within this discrete phrase :  thanks to the country 's wealth , a dual income was often not a necessity for a comfortable life . 
  if they substituted `` a full salary '' for `` a dual income '' that could sum up the entire article , i think . 
  you make it sound like the quality or genre of the * music * matters anything at all to winning this . 
   there is no serious argument why greece can be a eurovision superpower but somehow portugal ca n't . 
  there are several , but the only one that counts is rtp stopped participating and that is n't going to change in the foreseeable future . 
  it was a money drain : people realized long ago that - it was a contest , but was impossible to win or even finish in the top 5 ( later , in the top 20 or what 's called `` the final '' ) - only spain would give us votes ; - almost all songs in the whole contest were crap anyway . 
  so spectators lost interest . 
  sponsors and advertisers , and the cash-strapped organiser rtp followed . 
  i gather it still is a big thing in other countries . 
  good for you , carry on . 
  the food , my god , the food . 
  frankly , i could not eat any of that . 
  even coffee is n't * expresso * , just * de saco * . 
  there are differences between european countries after all . 
  big differences . 
  and that 's okay , i think . 
  before that , i have another question : why should i care ? 
   the only thing the houses need to do is do some proofchecking/factchecking they do n't even do that . 
  peer review is the only accepted way of doing that for a science book . 
  and that 's done by scientists , and the pay is exactly nothing ( see other comments ) . 
  yes , the publishing houses acquire the copyrights from the people who wrote the article/book fo nothing ; pays nothing to get it reviewed ; gets all the money from selling the book ... 
  even to the people who wrote it . 
  i know it 's hard to believe for a layman , but there you go ... publishing houses are thieves , by the common definition of the word . 
   ch\u00e9quia / tch\u00e9quia in portuguese nobody here uses those words . 
  we carefully use the official `` rep\u00fablica checa '' . 
  but it appears it would be all right to start using `` ch\u00e9quia '' ; can we ? 
  ^ ( brazilians would have to resort to * tch\u00e9quia * , i guess . 
  they wrote `` tchecoslov\u00e1quia '' ... ), 
  `` the dutch papers '' are expected any time soon . 
  it 's the number the local news media uses when they talk about it . 
  anyway , you grudgingly admit to `` thousands of people '' . 
  how can thousands of people be `` virtually non-existent '' ? 
  `` non-existent '' as in an estimated  50 000 people for a total pop . 
  of 10 million .
