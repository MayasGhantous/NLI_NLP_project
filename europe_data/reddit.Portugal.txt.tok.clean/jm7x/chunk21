  now , the percentage of arabs in those 50 000 is infinitesimal ... 
  if that interests anyone . 
  it does n't take a genius iq to see how bad this deal is for europe . 
  we should instead pressure turkey out of their involvement in syria . 
  it 's only helping daesh at the end of the day . 
  points in favour : - helping ending the syrian war - good for syrians , and perhaps not so many refugees would flee to europe then ; - letting kurds fight daesh . 
  in irak , they 're practically the only effective opposing force to an isis/il/wtf . 
  in syria , right now they 're just another civil war party ( aligned against daesh , and chased by turkey ) . 
  - no ransom paid to turk regime . 
  points against : - turk regime threatening several things , perhaps even expelling ( more ) refugees towards europe . 
  * wait , they 're doing that already * - there must be others i ca n't see right away ... 
  spoken like a true communist . 
  that 's what he said . 
  poles are good welders ; you , only steal cars . 
  / r/wtf ? 
  `` home '' or `` palace '' ? 
  at these prices ... 
  this photo was taken from the iss . 
  that 's a part of it . 
  not necessarily by that order ... 
  good . 
  this will fail and therefore provide some food for thought to publishers . 
  we cleverly avoided that trap of `` paying large sums of money for child birth '' by giving instead a symbolic amount ( that may be enough for the birth hospital bill , on a nhs hospital ) . 
  your suggestion is of course good common sense , which is why the government here totally disregards it . 
  instead , it built an enormous debt for the current young adults generation to pay , and increases taxes on a daily basis , for those foolish enough to stay . 
  needless to say , prospects do n't look good . 
  by 2060 , the projected population will be 7 million , from 10 today . 
  middle scenario : can be way lower than that . 
  however , spain will have bought everything here by then , so no worries : somebody will certainly use the space left . 
  ( otoh , my country could leave with barely anyone noticing . ), 
  now , by `` eu reform '' you are meaning `` end of eu '' or something like that ? 
  your scenario does seem to imply it . 
  cheaper than mine . 
  and it 's only good for 5 years . 
  `` large-scale '' in this context probably means `` one big , rich country exits '' . 
   `` if the french want us to leave , that could very well motivate the english to vote to stay , '' it just so happens i 'm seeing a rerun of `` yes , minister ! '' . 
  and i thought this could definitely be from a dialogue between jim hacker and sir humphrey . 
  i wonder ... 
  good news for eu , bad news for portugal . 
  as usual . 
   in the eu , 68 552 more babies were born in 2014 than in 2001 . 
  ( ... ) in contrast , the highest decrease was in portugal ( 27.0 % ) , it 's as if the euro is really bad for having babies : - }, 
   '' \u00daltimo soldado em angola '' last soldier in angola ( detail of the folded flag to be carried ) - sometime in the mid 70 's / / colle date is likely 1975-11-11 . 
  and a nitpick : he 's not a soldier , he 's a sailor , a * fuzileiro * ( officer , rank first lieutenant , apparently ) . 
  note the anchor on the black beret . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  but still far from 2008 figures , i guess ? 
  at least we have left government . 
  or is it behind ? 
  no matter , it 's left . 
  left is right , right is left behind . 
  wait , what ? 
  * sprinkle quotes as needed *, 
  ^ ( it 's so easy to shatter one 's dreams . ), 
   stuck with ~ 20 years olds . 
  ( * confused * ) no matter , i 'll sacrifice myself for the cause . 
  even if they 're grannies that age !, 
  the article guarantees they 'll be highly educated , so no worries . 
  i 'd learn a lot , of that i 'm sure . 
   i 've heard that latvia is actually better , there 's a serious shortage of intelligent , educated men . 
  yes , but i ca n't apply there : latvia requirements seem too high for me . 
   there were 117 women per 100 men . 
  looks like a place with seriously nice prospects for a guy , at first glance . 
  not exactly , as the * ponte salazar * ( as it was named in 1966 ) was built by u.s.steel . 
  but the design is indeed similar to the bay bridge , and is painted the same colour as the golden gate bridge ... 
  yes . 
  check / u/pyrignis nice and thorough comment above . 
  checks out . 
  now , subtract those that did n't bother to have a navy back then ( some still do n't have one , i think ;-) ) ... ok , the claim does n't seem as far fetched as it seemed first to me . 
  but i would expect at least france , china and denmark to have some kind of a navy before portugal 's foundation . 
  wikipedia marks the phrase with `` citation needed '' . 
  indeed . 
  forgot to add that this specific photo shows the start of the lisbon-c\u00e1diz leg of the [ tall ships race ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tall_ships'_races ) 2012 , joining the * sagres * commemorations . 
  i guess it 's only in the jolly spirit of the other `` navy '' recent posts ... 
  i doubt many countries have a continuous state history beyond the xii century , though . 
   germany ( tyskland ) fascinating translation . 
  i could n't guess it , unlike the other 3 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nrp_sagres_%281937%29 https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/nrp_sagres_iii belonged to germany , usa , brazil and now portugal ...  the ship has sailed under the portuguese flag since 1962 . 
  for that reason , in 2012 there were major commemorations of her 75th anniversary and 50 years in the service of the portuguese navy . 
  this photo is from that 2012 event . 
  ( i posted it here before ;-) ), 
  impressive demonstration of some highly complex manoeuvres , which no doubt took these elite sailors years to master . 
  opposing forces look confused , barking aimlessly . 
  job well done !, 
  glad to know , let 's just hope that goal is reached some day . 
  for now it 's just a worthy objective to aim for . 
  we will check again by 2023 or so . 
  i hope there 's still some kind of eu by then . 
  interesting . 
  there 's some hope for spain then : for those short peak periods , france may in the future import the odd gwh from them . 
  as for portugal , we currently export the excess wind production to spain , at zero cost . 
  do n't really see that change in the future ( well , perhaps the new pumping dams will use more ) . 
   if the price in iberia is lower than that of france now you hit the nail on the head : we ( portugal and spain ) will have to wait for france to discontinue their nuclear plants first . 
  yes , that 's why there 's such difficulty with those interconnects . 
  all of them have to pass through france . 
  and france has all this nuclear power to sell ... now connect all the dots ... * et voil\u00e0 * . 
  * energy union * my ass . 
  did i see some [ fouga magister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fouga_cm.170_magister ) 's ? 
  in the '80s , you say ?
