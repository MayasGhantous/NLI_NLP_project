  of course : it would be censored way before you could look at it . 
  so , you really ca n't . 
  i 'm not and i ca n't either : - }, 
  even with those planned interconnections , there is a problem : look at the map . 
  it does n't look likely we will ever be able to sell excess wind power . 
  hint : when there 's wind here , it also blows in spain . 
  yay , in this map we are a `` big country '' . 
  finally !, 
  we get our gas from algeria ( spanish pipelines , and a lng terminal should any trouble arise with those ) . 
  we are so far from all the things described in the article as , say , argentina . 
  that 's why i do n't get that concept of `` energy union '' . 
  or , more to the point , portugal does not get any of it ( * ) . 
  and that 's fine , i guess . 
  ( \\* ) * ( e.g. 
  : electricity interconnections could be a nice place to start ) *, 
  thanks , i guess ? ... 
  well , history says you are right ... 
  annexations are always popular , and dictators know this . 
  101 class at dictator school : `` when popularity decreases , just start a new war '' . 
  we affectionately call a 20 $ bill a `` 20 $ bill '' / * `` nota de vinte '' * . 
  we love them !, 
  fun fact : only the 20 , 10 and 5 ones are available at the atms . 
  so , one nearly never sees any of the other denominations . 
  ( i personally saw some 500 $ once , some 15 years ago , on a bank counter . 
  had 1 200 $ in my hands ( not mine ) , and owned 1 100 $ once . 
  i think ... ), 
  i was there last summer , and did n't realize that perfectly circular shape . 
  seeing things from above gives you a really different perspective ... what a beautiful city it is . 
  georgeous . 
  ok , sorry for the pun ( again ) !, 
  but you guys post such beautiful photos from your lovely country , i do n't know what else to say . 
  i 'll shut up now . 
  thanks ; euronews changed the link several times . 
  while it was in their front page i guess everybody still found the article ...  as i understand this elections , one candidate placed on kind of right of centre position managed to beat two candidates being on kind of left of centre positions . 
  yeah , it was like 1 centre , 9 left . 
  or so they said . 
  in portugal no politician dares to assume being `` right wing '' . 
  political suicide . 
  `` large depositors '' are those with  100 000 $ , it seems . 
  bank savings accounts are so pass\u00e9 . 
  from now on , a savvy investor will buy a large mattress instead . 
  and a shotgun . 
  funny how most of them mentioned portuguese . 
  in portugal , the idiom for `` i ca n't understand a single word '' is `` that 's greek to me '' . 
  certainly they were thinking of the sound of spanish , but knew spanish enough to reject that . 
  then they thought `` close to spanish but not spanish ... ? 
  must be portuguese '' . 
  `` it 's like spanish ... 
  but i know for sure it 's not spanish ... 
  i know !, 
  must be portuguese ! '', 
  this may bring the expression `` highway robbery '' to a new level . 
  no , we do n't . 
  * i have no idea how would this sound . 
  ( yes , i grokked the probable meaning from the english `` javascript '' giveaway . 
  no need for google translate , i 'm sure ), 
   postwoman waiting for the rain to pass to finish her round . 
  more likely waiting for the bus to get to her round , or returning from it . 
  i may be wrong , but this looks like the square near [ cais do sodr\u00e9 ] ( http://www.lisbonlux.com/lisbon/cais-do-sodre.html ) , lisbon ( public transportation hub ; `` sodr\u00e9 wharf '' in english , if you will ) . 
  so , confirmed it is . 
  sure , but my point was that a quarter of the median income in switzerland means `` very wealthy '' in a country like , say , portugal ( which is even a oecd , or `` developed '' , country ) . 
  in simpler terms , a `` poor '' swiss by that definition may be considered rich elsewhere ... 
  i 'd point out that `` something in an individual country '' is a somewhat irrelevant concept for a chart comparing countries . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  now , i assume that 's the median ... for that country . 
  now , imagine you were comparing to , say , oecd average ... or directly with some other country ... lots of possibilities , depending on your agenda . 
  i was going to write something along the lines of `` wtf switzerland '' , but the image says `` share of 65 + living in relative income poverty ... '' ( my emphasis ) , so i wo n't ( * ) . 
  just a poor title , then . 
  not sure if the lapse was intended , though . 
  ( * ) and without context , we do n't know what that `` relative '' means in this chart . 
  upvoted for showing my hometown . 
   the annual sauna world championship in finland has been called off after a russian man died after spending six minutes enduring a temperature of 110c . 
   vladimir ladyzhenskiy was pronounced dead after being dragged from the sauna by judges . 
  police were investigating the cause of death . 
  uhhhmm ... may i suggest something to the police ? 
   i wish all their socks become slightly damp i lost it here . 
  still laughing . 
  when thousands of romanians came to live here in the '90s they somehow got around all that . 
  in order : yes , and yes . 
  no , no , but yes . 
  extremely negative ( due to successful negative propaganda ) . 
  i 'm very glad to not find a single comment about portugal in a thread such as this one . 
  the chart puts us just a little above ea19 , hidden behind the crowd . 
  we must have been doing something right after all since 2011 . 
  move to iceland , they always appear in these charts . 
  without our countries included , why would we care about it ? 
  actually , 2nd . 
  cyprus wins . 
  although as a mortal enemy for most of that time . 
  not sure what your point is . 
   madrid at 7 am or so i 'm freezing my ass at 3-4\u00bac ... later ... bang , 22\u00bac that 's what you get for building a city in the middle of a landmass : continental weather . 
  well , so `` mass defection '' is a bit of a stretch then ? - ) i 'm also somewhat bothered by those 68 pieces . 
  may be important , depending on what those belonged to . 
  bad pun . 
  probably because we were stuck at the end of it , we only got the temperate climate and the gulf stream . 
  not bad anyway , i guess . 
  24 here . 
  `` st. martin 's summer '' . 
  oh , and same latitude as washington dc . 
  gorgeous .
