  not georgeous , but gorgeous . 
  * the peculiar blue roofs make a nice touch . 
  perhaps the whole force is like 100 ? 
  i liked what he did as prime-minister , and knew he would use his powers in a sensible way -- even when not pleasing his former party . 
  many accused him of not intervening enough , or when he nominated s\u00f3crates fot prime-minister with a parliamentary minority , but i think differently . 
  in my view , he did what the president is supposed to do , e.g. 
  giving advice to the parties to reach for agreements in the emergency the country was in . 
  advice that was unfortunately largely ignored , especially by ps . 
  he now leaves in amidst a political mess , but one not of his doing . 
  or lack thereof . 
   in a conventional parliamentary democracy costa won , his party had the largest single share of the votes . 
  no , ps had 32 % . 
  p\u00e0f had 38 % . 
  psd and cds votes were not counted , they did n't run separately . 
   they are a different type of coalition , as they can not split due to the shared seats . 
  that is correct . 
  although they split the seats between them by the coalition agreement formula . 
   ( ... ) coalition being formed by the left . 
  they have a voting agreement nothing more . 
  as of today , they have nothing but a declared intention to eventually reach a parliament agreement , with ongoing private negotiations . 
  lastly , your comparison of our president with that iffy american politician is so far out i can only say that you are wrong . 
  and that finally he justified my vote , for having the balls to clearly state what 's on the table , something nobody else here seems to have . 
  your article lost me here :  costa won the 4 october elections hahahaha nice try , costa . 
  itt : confusion between `` support for '' and `` equality '' . 
  in this country we have same sex marriage since 2010 and a `` support '' of `` only '' 61 % . 
  that just means that even if i do n't `` support '' it , i do n't care if it exists or if it 's popular . 
  people here like to mind their own business and that the others do the same . 
  i think this is the very definition of * tolerance * . 
  i think he summed it up pretty well . 
   more than 128,000 of our readers rated their favorite all american . 
   favorite cities in the world this year * outside the u.s. * :-), 
  thanks for the video , never heard that one before . 
  but it 's something he might say in a campaign ( as the subtitle implies ) . 
  the one i cited is , however , a clever invention by his opponents : the majority of the portuguese people believe it !, 
  so , did you read their program ? 
  please note , `` marxist-leninist '' is still considered `` communist '' in many countries . 
   many of the * obvious and sensible policies * that will be proposed by the socialist government , lol , i think you 're hoping a bit too much from your purported future possible socialist government ... 
   proud maker of sentences like `` i 'm never wrong and i rarely have doubts '' you should know he never said that . 
  just try to produce the original quote and i guarantee you 'll be surprised ; bear in mind that some parties have ruthlessly efficient and professional propaganda machines . 
  your belief in this sound-bite is proof of that . 
  those machines are proud as the makers of those sound-bites . 
  they just ca n't assume it publicly , which is a shame ... 
  do n't go swim in january then . 
  try it in the summer , like the other folks do . 
  no ; turning them forward is . 
  and about the same number for `` what you drink '' ... 
  did n't you miss , e.g. , `` tea the english way '' ? 
  i was answering aikido , but ... no of course it 's not that , silly . 
  i think it 's about you 're in the army or not ... 
  although the options sound a bit odd for this . 
  the parliament has 230 seats . 
  all listed seat numbers are wrong , except in the phrase  the 116 seats needed to form a majority government . 
  so the big depression did have one positive effect ... 
  not really surprised by carlos burrinho appearance in the list . 
  thank you for your examples of english pronunciation rules ( and some exceptions ;-) ) well , to a foreigner , pronunciation like a native speaker is a nearly impossible dream . 
  dozens of years of practice in place may , or may not , do it . 
  what i did n't know was that the writing also depended in some ways in how some words are spoken ... 
  it 's almost like the native speakers conspired to make learning the language as difficult as possible ( even at the expense of making it difficult for themselves ) , just to more easily spot the odd sneaky foreigner :-), 
  oh man i 'm sorry , of course you 're right : `` baiass '' is more accurate . 
  there 's the german `` airropa '' ( `` oirropa '' ? ), 
  right ? 
  in portuguese : `` baias '' . 
  there 's an american airbase there . 
  i guess some baseball could presumably be played by the military there ... ? 
  never heard of it . 
  might be a troll article ... 
  you mean the spectators , right ? 
  thank you for the reference . 
  i thought i understood this english `` an/a '' rule . 
  i now see how much of a fool i was . 
  it 's beyond my dreams and ability to understand the delicate intricacy of it . 
  that powerful `` depends on how you would pronounce the next letter in your region '' is nothing next to the mighty :  because european is said with an initial y sound which counts as a consonantal sound in english speech , it is said ( and written ) with a not an . 
  i give up . 
  we were set to boss this one , however belgium won by a narrow margin . 
  but just you wait , in 10 years we 'll be over 100 % easily !, 
  see you then !, 
  yes , sure , but i do n't get those . 
  only `` pile of debts '' , `` navigators '' and `` beach resort '' ( * ) ? 
  i find your lack of stereotypes disturbing . 
  * raises hand and op starts to gag * ( * ) in the middle of alentejo , now that 's funny . 
  also , `` indshield '' ? 
  what are those ? 
  i live in it . 
  source : me . 
  probably is n't the public outrage that died down , but the hard limit of 2-4 weeks for focus in the media that kicked in . 
  then they have to move on to the next catastrophe ( * ) . 
  they probably teach these things in basic journalism courses . 
  ( * ) currently `` syria russian attacks '' or something . 
  10c here since a few months ago . 
  production of < 50\u00b5m bags stopped completely . 
  you ca n't use '' - issimo '' or '' - mente '' to distinguish italian from portuguese ;-) and the example `` lento '' + `` lentamente '' are ... 
  exactly the same , in both languages . 
   - accio ( for bad things ) . 
  * catenaccio * was n't bad ... was it ? - ), 
   messrs. hackenberg and hatz i thought they would be dipl.-ing . 
  woot ? 
  ze fake jurman aksant ? 
  well , technically speaking he was n't wrong ... maybe just missing a lot of context . 
  thanks , now i got it : so , in english `` racist '' may mean ( among other things , perhaps ? ), 
  an f1 driver , a 100m runner ... well , anyone who races , right ?
