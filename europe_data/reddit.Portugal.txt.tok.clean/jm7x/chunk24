  thanks again for clearing this up . 
  not a native speaker !, 
  religion is a race ? 
  or even : `` i do n't necessarily agree with those muslims , because i have some reservations about their views on progress , and their potentially excessive use of force '' . 
  is this a better phrasing for your legal constraints ? 
  islam is a race ? 
  so , easier ( and cheaper ) to own a sig550 there than a hunting double-barrel shotgun here ... 
  even easier to own a double-barrel shotgun there than a bb gun here : - }, 
  romania is n't that bad , come on . 
  and we do tend to migrate to almost any place in the world , historically . 
  have n't you read the news since 2008 or so ? 
  offer the gnr a * presunto * if they appear . 
   i think it is illegal only if you want to sell it . 
  for your own consumption it is still ok . 
  possibly , but i would n't risk it without legal counselling . 
  or making sure nobody tells the * guarda * about it : - }  are there some portuguese videos/docus similar to this ? 
  sure ; a simple googling for * `` matan\u00e7a do porco '' * in google.pt got lots of them , [ images ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=matan%c3%a7a+do+porco&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=nkk&amp;channel=fs&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cb4qsarqfqotcibn5_qpmsgcfci5faodcb4cdq ) and videos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctd8mi_5uma https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbpirub1cq ( ortiga - ma\u00e7\u00e3o , 2015 ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiu6gb1w6dy ( a\u00e7oreira , torre de moncorvo ) etc. 
  the procedure looks very similar in all these different regions to the one i described . 
  and many similarities with your video , like the drinking and partying :-), 
  at my father 's village , after the pig was dead ( blood carefully extracted for the * chouri\u00e7o de sangue * ) , the skin was lightly scorched with fire from pine needles for enhanced flavour ( * edit : * and easier shaving ) . 
  at the end of the function , the entire pig was separated into its component parts , all of which had some use . 
  barely anything was thrown away , to my amazement . 
  fast forward to 2015 : all this is entirely illegal , as per brussels mandated laws . 
  licensed industrial facilities only . 
   czech republic can produce cars that hold up to german standards mmm ... vw subsidiaries . 
  ok ...  turns out that poles have a proper work attitude , the czech republic can produce cars that hold up to german standards and the estonians and romanians got this whole it business all figured out . 
  apples , oranges ... you 're hoping that this new wave of immigrants all come from the same continent . 
  well , i hate to break these news to you , but ... no , they come from a very different world . 
  that does n't mean they ca n't integrate with europe , but it 's a lot to get to the point a polish or romanian was when he arrived there to work 20 years ago . 
  another mildly interesting bit : in portuguese , it became `` salamaleque '' , used to mock any kind of ceremonious greetings . 
  oh , and sorry for the nitpick : in english i think it 's usually represented as '' [ salaam aleikum ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salaam%20alaikum ) '' ? 
  here in lisbon it is n't , but we 're shivering right now under some severe 17\u00bac . 
  in portuguese , there is only `` presidente '' , and `` chairman '' can only be translated to `` presidente '' also ( `` man of the chair '' has no word for it ) . 
  probably americans were not willing to concede the title of `` president '' to some foreigner ? - ), 
  thank you for your explanation . 
  it does make sense in the hypocritical communist way . 
  always found this curious . 
  why `` chairman '' and not `` president '' ? 
  the usa have one `` president '' . 
  the word does exist in english . 
  and the meaning is exact and precise . 
  lol, 
  `` independent '' from who ? 
  the public , you mean ? 
   european culture i gagged at this point , sorry !, 
   for the amount of viewers it gets it 's a bargain . 
  how many rtp viewers are you expecting ? 
  just curious . 
  remember that portugal 's singer ( s ) will only be seen in 1 show . 
   the list includes romania and portugal who are returning to the competition after a year 's absence . 
  wtf ? 
  another `` socialist reversal '' ? 
  another useless expense for the taxpayer . 
  great . 
  since they do n't have * any * money for maintaining stuff like pensions and such , they do n't increase the investment . 
  then ... all you say . 
  the ratio between the 2 numbers would be interesting as well . 
  no , it did n't . 
  i believe there was an update in the news yesterday or today ... 
  but in the same line as all previous ones : deficit increased all this year long . 
  care to send me your source on such extraordinary claim ? 
  it appears to know better than all official ones ... * edit : of course i have mixed `` debt '' with `` deficit '' , and apologize if by `` deficit '' you mean the current year 's extra debt , which ca n't exceed 2,5 % x gnp by ue agreements . 
   portuguese growth increased , * bzzzzt * wrong  deficit decreased . 
  * bzzzzt * wrong come on , comrade . 
  this discredits all the other things you wrote . 
  i must be getting old : i was convinced belgium was still a country ... 
  imagine that , lol ? 
  an european is nominated to lead the united nations as secretary general ... 
  these news meet a resounding lack of interest in / r/europe . 
  in the near future , states may enforce assisted suicide for people deemed to have ` completed life ' but are not terminally ill ... * wait a minute ... *, 
  yes , me too . 
  what i meant to point out is that portugal is fairly `` isolated '' in the sense your described . 
  portugal seems on the `` yes '' side . 
  strange . 
  a european gets the highest post in the u. n. people downvote the news immediately . 
  i do n't get it . 
  * dear moderators , no it is not a duplicate . 
  if you care to read at least the titles , anyway . 
  although his economic governance was not really what the country needed ( essentialy he turned a healthy gnp growth into a near stagnant one ) perhaps his other qualities are more appropriate to a ( high ) diplomatic position . 
  he did manage to obtain independence for east timor , against all odds . 
  getting clinton on his side in this was a real surprise ... his 10 years as u. n. high commissioner for refugees are highly regarded as well . 
  perhaps we can hope he gets u. n. to change to a more effective role ... 
  i use reddit instead . 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  all colonies are `` integral parts '' until they are n't any more . 
  thanks romania !, 
   no it is based on foreign born and while you are right that many were portuguese born , there were also people - children obviously and younger generation that was angolan born - considering how huge the number was - even share of 10-20 % would be enought to make angola no. 1 i already explained why you are wrong here . 
  country `` angola '' did n't exist when those people were born . 
  whether they were born in the province of minho , madeira , cabo verde or angola , they were born in portugal . 
  i see you reread my previous reply and edited the post . 
  however , see below :  for example french statistics among immigrants from algeria do not count pied noirs . 
  why use double standards here ? 
  let me guess : because france is an important and respected country , unlike portugal ? 
   if someone asks you where and you say africa well you were not born in what is current portugal i see there 's some confusion about `` foreign born '' , and `` immigrant '' , vs. `` national '' . 
  portuguese law includes the case of someone being born abroad and still having portuguese nationality . 
  and yes , we portuguese are always a bit defensive when others talk about us . 
  we need to . 
   portugal - it should be brazil but map is about foreign born - including retornados - white portuguese that left angola since 70s and , , came back , , to portugal - so if included angola is easily no. 1 but the title of the thread ( and the map itself ) says `` immigrants '' . 
  so , this is wrong . 
  `` retornados '' literally means `` those who return '' .
