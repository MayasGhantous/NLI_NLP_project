  right ? 
  well , many americans i met here do live here now . 
  perhaps it was a problem with the nyt question : - `` would you like to visit this european country as a tourist ? '', 
  30 % : `` yeah , cool '' 70 % : `` hell no !, 
  i want to live there instead ! '', 
  that was my 1st thought , fellow gamer :-), 
  ^ ( i do n't know , it could be read in several wrong ways ... )  - ), 
  it could also stand for , say , `` sufficiently united kingdom '' . 
  let 's be positive !, 
  is n't this as much difficult as recruiting , say , nazi jews ? 
  it seems that either way the name `` uk '' is safe . 
  no need for changes like : - formerly united kingdom or ( opposite outcome ) - finally united kingdom or - scarcely united kingdom ... ? 
  anyway , there would be an abbreviation problem . 
  * ( peace ) *, 
  ok , i understand what you meant . 
  i was just focussing on the brain drain subject , but nowadays every discussion in this sub seems to come back to austerity politics ... well , i ca n't resist giving my 2 cents to that : i understand that germany thinks that what was a success overcoming its own reunification issues will be a success if applied to all of the eurozone ( even all of eu ) . 
  well , i do n't dispute that . 
  i think it 's brilliant , logical and effective -- * given those conditions * . 
  however , it can only work if what i said in my previous comment also applies . 
  and i do n't see any chance of that in the near future ( i can hear the mob screaming `` federalism !!!, 
  '' ) , not in present eu . 
  i 'm afraid the results will then come out quite different . 
  sorry , but are n't you referring to the east vs. west half of germany ? 
  east germans were migrating to the west , not to other countries , right ? 
  comparing the situation there with the one we were discussing ( all of eu ) , i suggest looking into some differences : * east germans were migrating to the same country , probably as far as some hundred kilometers , but to somewhere speaking their language . 
  * german government made massive money transfers and other types of help to the former east germany . 
  * there is only one government and a single policy in germany , one set of laws and taxes ... * ( i could go on forever here ... ) with 80 million people you can make you own internal economic policy . 
  with 10 it just is n't possible . 
  eu has hundreds of millions , yes , but each country is just caring for itself . 
  therefore , not relevant for this discussion . 
   how has growth been since the euro in portugal and how has it been before the euro ? 
  let 's see : [ gdp , constant prices , ref = 2006 ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/growth+rate+%28percentage%29+of+gdp+and+gdp+per+capita++constant+prices+%282006%29-883 ) ( quick exec summary  year | var . 
  ( % ) -- | -- | 1990 | 8 | | 2000 | 4 | | 2001 | 2 | | 2002 | 0,7 | | 2003 | -0,9 | | ... | i guess it 's alarmingly self-explanatory . 
   not all of europe is stagnant : uk , switzerland , sweden , norway , poland are doing great . 
  ( not in the euro . ), 
  well , the `` not in the euro '' bit seems important . 
  or even `` not in the eu '' for half of the examples ^ ( i count the uk as 50/50 here ... ) i 'm not suggesting anything . 
  just the facts . 
  well , if you have one let 's hear it . 
  i do n't have any sure and clear one that only depends on that country alone ( portugal in my example ) . 
  but there are others that can break the cycle ( same example ) : * eu starts an economic growth cycle . 
  like in the 1950-2000 era , that would be jolly . 
  europe would carry our economy forward , buying our stuff or even invest here or something ( one can dream ... ) ( well ? 
  what are you waiting for ? 
  we 're hoping for this since we joined the euro !, 
  and no , < 1 % growth does not qualify , sorry . ), 
  * some other ( emergent ? ), 
  economies suddenly need something they can get here for cheap ( at least cheaper than elsewhere ) . 
  : sines port overtakes rotterdam , or some other impossible dream like that . 
  as long as europe stays stagnant , so will we . 
  rebounding to year 2000 gnp will take years at this rate . 
   benefits to the country by allowing the job market to become relatively less saturated please do tell me about these . 
  i do n't see many aside those for the currently employed individuals . 
   and i do n't see how this will create a loop . 
  well , let me then break that down for you : preconditions : - country invests heavily in education . 
  note : this is expensive , and comes from taxpayers pockets . 
  rationale is that to be a developed country today , highly trained people are key to be able to use and advance technology , mainly bot not limited to industry ; - some world-wide catastrophic event occurs ( e.g. , some lehman brothers whatnot in another continent ) ; now for the loop : - recession ensues , and you 're suddenly left with lots of highly qualified people with nothing to do ; - they of course start seeking jobs elsewhere . 
  they 're highly qualified , remember , so there are lots of nice places to choose . 
  let 's say `` england '' . 
  - after they left , they leave the job market relatively less saturated . 
  nice ? 
  - then , after cleaning up most of the rubble and ruins left by aforementioned catastrophe , the country tries to come out of recession . 
  after years of it , there 's a lot of catching up to do to get to where it was before the crash . 
  - what to do ? 
  being more competitive , silly !, 
  so , let 's do it !, 
  we can lower some company taxes , etc. . . - this , however , hits a wall : how to get more competitive without more highly qualified people ? 
  remember , they left in that bullet above . 
  - no matter , we 'll just train more !, 
  we now know how to do that ... 
  wait !, 
  there 's a problem here : - among the first to leave are researchers and other professors at university level . 
  you are now left with lower standards of education at the higher level , and that will percolate to lower levels ( high school , and so on ) . 
  - compound the above problem with a demographic one : each year you have less students at all levels of education . 
  result : no way to substitute those who emigrated . 
  * please note that in a recession people refrain from having too many children , so this guarantees this demography for a 20 years time frame * . 
  - since you are still trying to come out of recession , not much money is available to lure those guys ( or nationals from any other country for that matter ) . 
  - with a shortage of highly trained professionals , your plan to have more competitive industry and/or services has limited success . 
  let 's face it : it just sinks . 
  - go to step 1 . 
  recession ensues , and you 're suddenly ( ... ) satisfied ? 
  i tried to get it as explicit and detailed as possible without getting too specific to a single situation . 
  * sources : portugal 1995-2014 . 
   just because it 's left spain or portugal or greece or italy does n't mean it 's disappeared . 
  not really sure what you mean , but the point here is that spain or portugal or greece or italy lose those expensively trained professionals . 
  with obvious consequences for that country , which in turn will make that trend more likely in the future , in a positive feedback loop . 
  for the individuals it 's likely ( in general ) a positive move , or they would n't be making it in the first place . 
  the azores are volcanic islands , like most of indonesia . 
  is that what you mean ? 
  ( i never visited indonesia ... ), 
  of course : it 's a volcano . 
  well , there 's a little tower there to make it a much nicer 2000m :-), 
  to my surprise , portugal is n't in the lowest group ... other surprise : the gender difference across the board is shocking . 
  germany is one of the most equal in this respect , kudos . 
  ( this predicts lots of social problems , greater than when the difference was `` on the other side '' ... ), 
  what ? 
  we easily beat italy 64-58 . 
  now , in a real basketball game ... 
  thanks for pointing out we are ahead of italy in one field !, 
  who would have ever imagined .
