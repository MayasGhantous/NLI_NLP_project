  wait !, 
  i see other numbers below 64 , like ... a lot of them . 
  hey , we 're not that bad after all : we seem to be mid-table or so . 
  ( who else would come up with portugal bashing ... ? ), 
  this is a very insecure map . 
  self-doubt everywhere . 
  '' * atlantic ocean ? 
  * '' '' * celtic sea ? 
  `` we do n't know for sure if any of this is true ? '', 
  but it 's the truth , right ? 
   if you 're right , it probably means that portugal 's growth was not due to investments . 
  eu cohesion funds ? 
  now with the last program of 2015-2022 , we 'll have to do some miracle with those 26 g $ . 
  there will be no more eu `` cohesion funds '' after 2022 ... 
  but judging by the previous programs , the prospects are grim . 
   or shifting income from foreign subsidiaries of portugal companies ( things like `` brand licensing '' etc , which count into gdp , even though they are really fake ) . 
  nope . 
  there 's almost no such thing as `` foreign subsidiaries '' as such and they would never do that due to portugal 's sky-high taxes . 
  the exact contrary is what happens : the biggest portugal companies ( shall i say ex-portuguese ? ), 
  now are based , or are moving , to the netherlands or luxembourg . 
  i was talking about sweden . 
  as for portugal , see [ the pordata stats ] ( http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/forest+fires+and+burnt+area+%20+mainland-1192 ) . 
  2005 was a bad year , indeed : 35,824 fires ; 339,089 ha burned . 
  that 's bad . 
  never thought there could be any forest fires up there ( cold + moisture ) . 
  another comment says people are being evacuated . 
  let 's hope nobody gets hurt and no homes burn . 
  ( last year 8 firemen/women died here . 
  iirc , no civilians ... ), 
   deposit rate below inflation is a sign of recession . 
  no , a sign of recession is deflation ( negative inflation ) . 
  that 's what we got here in portugal for years now . 
  but i see what you mean . 
  in growth periods ( in the '90s ) , deposit rates were always following inflation . 
  in the 80 's was in fact recession for people who made deposits at banks in the sense that inflation always largely exceeded predictions and deposit rates were woefully under that . 
  i guess in a country with real growth banks would so much need deposits they would offer rates above inflation . 
  but that 's not the case in current europe anyway . 
  remember -- citing myself from other comment : no risk deposits will always have low returns , when you take inflation into account . 
  compound interest has exponential growth ... 
  in a growing economy , you buy company stocks , not bonds or deposits ... that 's for dwindling or shaky economies . 
  yes , wonder why the difference ? 
  i do n't know the numbers , but i bet the difference accounts for the bank predicting a zloty devaluation to the euro . 
  it 's called `` exchange risk '' , i believe . 
  if your inflation is 1,6 % ** in zloty ** it 's pretty low -- comparable or less to inflation in eu zone ( 2,5 % average in 2013 i believe ) . 
  if you want to compare , you must also calculate what the inflation would be in euros . 
  no risk deposits will always have low returns , when you take inflation into account . 
  compound interest has exponential growth ... 
  otoh , we do n't really have jokes about brasilians . 
  or about any other country , for that matter . 
  we make only jokes about ourselves ( alentejanos at most ) . 
  this is how banks work . 
  to have better interest than inflation , you have to invest and assume some risk . 
  now answering your question : here in portugal it 's possible to find deposits paying < 1,5 % . 
  tax on interest is 28 % . 
  is sweden trying to compete with us ? 
  this summer has been unusually mild here , so not too many great fires -- yet . 
  up to july 15 , only 6495 ha . 
  that 's four times less compared to the same period in 2013 . 
  please note that the lisbon photo shows two closely parked buses , not an unusually long bendy bus . 
  :-) ( we have those too in lisbon , m. benz citaro g , look like sofia 's ) . 
  ** portugal ** nothing much : following its owner , the family esp\u00edrito santo , the biggest economic group here , the biggest private bank ( bes ) also imploded . 
  it will be the first real test for the new eu laws for bankrupt banks . 
  the solution involves creating a new `` good bank '' , leaving all bad stuff in the old , `` bad bank '' . 
  all this will be in effect tomorrow , monday . 
  mmmm ... oh , the `` new bank '' will need the rest of the money the troika reserved for these mishaps . 
  as i said , nothing to see here , move along . 
  we do agree then that until we get real democracy , representative or direct ( i prefer the last one ) , the current choice is between an oligarchic or a bureaucratic dictatorship . 
  let 's hope one day ... ps on the 3rd bullet : robots will be hard to unionise -- that 's why they were bought in the first place . 
  consumers without enough money to choose also have little say ... 
  easy : all of them . 
  boy we do look out of place in this map . 
  alright , let 's compare each one : * capitalism with basic income . 
  besides what / u/willkydd said , remember that if basic income is defined as it now where i live ( `` not really enough to have both a roof * and * a meal every day '' ) , most people ca n't really afford anything from the awesome crapload of goods those robots are churning out . 
  that 's really bad news for the owners , so i guess they will come to a compromise , raising basic income as little ( giving up a chunk of their profits ) as long it guarantees it will all come back to them -- and at the same time preventing the populace to starve to death , that would hurt sales . 
  oh wait , that 's what is already happening right now . 
  so , what changes ? 
  simple : before ( that is now ) all the population was working at their factories , fields , offices ... now they are all idle , being served by mindless robots . 
  frankly , i do n't see this type of society to be stable for long . 
  all theories on capitalism revolve about owners of capital and means of production vs. owners of work force . 
  this scenario removes this last side : the owners of capital own the means of production and the workforce . 
  the remaining 99 % of people would own nothing . 
  bad dynamics there . 
  * socialism this is interesting . 
  now , you know this was tried on big and small countries and did n't work ; people got fed up with the poverty and threw it away ( ok , i know about cuba and north korea . 
  just wait ... ) . 
  are you saying that socialism + robots would work ? 
  but what would really change against `` old socialism '' ? 
  would n't a small elite still reap the crop of the robots work and leave an arbitrarily small chunk to the remaining 99 % as before ? 
  ( note : surprisingly remarkable similarities with capitalism after all is said and done ) * post-scarcity anarchism this one i 'm not very familiar with . 
  what would be the main differences to the present say anarchism ? 
  would law-of-the-jungle and free-for-all no longer apply ? 
  if so , why ? 
  btw , who will keep those robot factories running in this society ? 
  or , for that matter , any utilities , infrastructure , etc. 
  sorry for being such a sceptic : i 'm a grumpy old man and i heard and read a lot of crap in my life about this `` ideologies '' stuff . 
  that does n't mean i did n't like what you wrote -- i think your suggestions are a great discussion start . 
  in that graph , i assume are you talking about `` finance & insurance '' or the various services . 
  sure , they sum up to a big percentage . 
  what this graph does n't tell you is that without `` manufacturing '' and `` trade '' those other items would n't even exist . 
  and that was what i meant in previous comment .
