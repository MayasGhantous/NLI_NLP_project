  us economy is still strong due to those 18 % sales and 13 % employees in manufacturing ( and other small in the graph but huge in importance , like utilities , transportation , mining ... ) . 
  waht i can say is that in my own country the destruction of industry and agriculture and the corresponding increasing reliance in the services sector is n't going too well . 
  sources : search for `` portugal '' in eurostat or any finance press ... 
  yeah , but imagine that all work is done with machines , simply because they are more efficient/productive ( that 's less and less sci-fi everyday ) . 
  note : productivity includes how much they cost per month . 
  what would people do ? 
  i mean the not-robot-factory-owning people . 
  the owners do n't have to do anything but what they do now , so leave them aside . 
  `` work '' is out of the equation , remember . 
  machines do it better . 
  so , again , what would those sad unemployed citizens do for a living ? 
  ( i 'll avoid substituting `` 3rd world workers '' for `` robots '' above , for now ) . 
   most * dwindling * economies are now revolving around services . 
  ftfy, 
  people are made of * argentum * there . 
  everyone knows argentum is hard to tell against the white background . 
  it 's not a crime in portugal for years now . 
   but , please , dont compare `` germany '' and `` berlin '' , berlin is the trashcan of germany , it is hated everywhere - except berlin , of course . 
  there was this sudden temptation to replace `` germany '' and `` berlin '' by `` europe '' and `` germany '' here . 
  fortunately , i resisted it . 
  yeah of course , it was just a joke on a previous comment . 
  we all know the rules for public acquisitions : the cheapest offer is the natural primary criterion , as long as the contractor says he has the product and will comply with all the conditions and requirements ( most of them are standard for all eu countries ) . 
  there is just one thing all those rules do n't have a solution for : the contractor may be lying . 
  and to win a nice contract is a big incentive to lie ... 
  the germans got 25.000 things wrong in a single project ? 
  but ... 
  i did n't  think the germans would leave anything like that to chance . 
  someone said that up thread !, 
  and i believed him !, 
  * mind boggles * my hopes and beliefs lie shattered . 
  \\ - \\ - ^ ( tone : slightly ironic . 
  tongue firmly in cheek . ), 
  could not find the numbers/ratings of `` energy efficiency '' including other countries in the site , but there are some stats on wind and solar , [ e.g. 
  wind power / gdp ] ( http://cleantechnica.com/2013/06/20/top-wind-power-countries-in-the-world-per-gdp/ ) . 
  thanks , quite interesting !, 
  ( no tripoints here , of course ), 
  it depends on what you mean by `` jobs for the government '' : one thing is a minister or other member of government -- he 's openly nominated by his party and if he pays something to them is his business . 
  he will be sacked whenever the prime minister wishes anyway ... other is to be , say , appointed ceo or other important position of a public service/company . 
  or worse , a private one ... 
  it is , however , how it works here . 
  but in secrecy ... party funding is n't too transparent in this country :-( there is , however , an example in portugal of what i think you ask : the communist party ( pcp ) assigns a fixed salary to each elected member . 
  the rest he receives from his public position goes all to the party . 
  or so they say . 
  why ? 
  ( i 'm really curious ... ) but hey , we have more than iceland , slovakia , slovenia , estonia and latvia combined !, 
  so there . 
  hey , this is n't a `` fun index '' , is it ? - ) i mean , i can imagine many funnier things than roller coasters ... well , probably i never rode a `` good one '' . 
  of course not . 
  it 's the wild east . 
  you work for rt , right ? 
  the independent and informative commentary gives you away . 
  their debt is in euro . 
  having its own money and devaluing it will not help paying the debt . 
  that said , that would give a bit more leeway to greece 's own economic governance . 
  which could be good . 
  or not . 
  let them sue . 
  an impartial court will define what is considered `` retroactive '' and you 'll see . 
  as portugal followed spain 's policies on `` green electricity '' almost by the letter , i do n't know if the all the effects are the same , but what you described in the oc already happened here -- with the difference portugal did n't stop this insane run to disaster . 
  other effects : some of the highest tariffs on electricity in europe and a running public debt to the power companies ( the price for mwh is now so high they were scared to reflect that entirely on consumer prices -- yet ) . 
  and they still subsidize new dams and windmills to produce energy nobody wants but is still fully paid by the consumer -- by law . 
  worse , the most insulting is the subsidies to gas and coal powerplants that only exist to provide backup power ( you know , wind is n't always blowing , the sun sets at night ... ) . 
  none of this was required by the consumers ( industry , people at home ... ) . 
  i guess this is what happens when communism meets capitalism and have a lovechild : a policy with the drawbacks of both . 
  one way to recover this thoughtless investment would be to export excess electricity , right ? 
  well , guess what : the only country that we could export too invested in exactly the same energy sources , and when we have excess they have too . 
  so , portugal is only allowed to export electricity at zero cost . 
  tl ; dr : spain recognized the need to change existing energy policies in the country 's interest . 
  portugal still does n't . 
  :-( sorry for the long rant , but this is a subject that makes my blood boil . 
  funny , the map says we have here a 265m mast ... should have seen it already , seems hard to conceal . 
  however , had to resort to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_structures_in_portugal ) to know about it . 
  it 's a radio antenna , not surprisingly . 
  ( normally they do n't have to be that big : we usually just put them on top of a mountain or the biggest hill around ... ) so , yours is bigger than ours ( except for greece and neighbours , apparently ) . 
  oh , and the tallest building is a mere 120m . 
  we do n't like big skyscrapers , they ruin the view . 
  if only our government had the cojones to do the same ... :-(, 
   it is frequently news if a portuguese anything is noticed in a `` big country '' . 
  that 's quite rare , so it really is newsworthy for us . 
  otoh , i ca n't imagine a post like op 's example to get that kind of attention from reddit if it had s/finland/portugal / : all the world * ( read : usa ) * knows that finland is a dream country , at the top 10 of every wealth and well-being index you can imagine . 
  as for portugal ... well :-] let 's just say that there are small countries , then there are smaller countries . 
  and leave it at that : - } ^ ( oh , before you say it : portugal has almost twice the population of finland . 
  that 's not what i 'm talking about . ), 
  : - } never thought of it that way . 
  in a regular job here , to fill a 40l tank , let me see ... 1,6 x40 = 64 $ ... that 's 3 days of work . 
  not bad too !, 
  ( * sorry , offtopic : * it reminded me i work 4-5 hours a day , every day , to pay my taxes . 
  the remaining 3-4 , that 's where my salary finally comes from . 
  miguelense ( island of s.miguel , a\u00e7ores ) . 
  the rest of the country is too standardized nowadays . 
  except mirand\u00eas , but that 's a different language , not just a dialect ( never heard anyone speaking that : it 's from a particular region and almost extinct ) . 
  down to 14,3 % , but kept that 5th place firmly in our hands . 
  yay . 
  we 'll just call her `` catarina '' here . 
  which is a perfectly normal female name . 
   fuel price ( 95 ) : $ 1,82 / l ouch !, 
  and i thought the 1,6 $ / l here was expensive !, 
  countries without oil resources are like that . 
  wait ... 
  yes .
