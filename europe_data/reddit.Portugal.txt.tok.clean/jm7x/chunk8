  so , i short , the million dollar question : how ? 
  ( note : we 're not that small , there are smaller countries that do well , but it 's not an advantage * per se * , perhaps the opposite . ), 
  it does generate growth -- in china , also india and south-east asia ( and other developing countries elsewhere ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think it 's globally good for the world , but countries like ours do n't have really the resources to effectively raise those massive developing countries . 
  we must instead worry about competing with them ( finland is in a enviable position right now , should hold on to it ) . 
  generating growth here in eurozone is not possible today with keynes ' methods . 
  customs tariffs , devaluating coin , limiting imports , sectoral growth , and most of all , industry growth , all are strictly limited or forbidden . 
  europe is still convinced it 's the centre of the economic world , but that is changing fast . 
  especially for industry . 
  that 's why i said : government spending = = throwing water to a bottomless bucket ... ( ok , simply making china grow : substitute that for `` throwing buckets of water to the caspian sea '' or something ), 
   government spending works like a multiplier in the economy . 
  so government spending even through debt will result in economic growth . 
  this is the classic `` keynesian approach '' , which does not work in a country open to a globalised economy . 
  you see , if you inject money to build stuff ( the above approach does n't really care which stuff , but if it 's for the public good the better ) , make sure the contractors are local , the workers are native , and all imports of materials can be reduced to the absolute minimum . 
  otherwise , you 're just helping other countries , not your own . 
  and ending owing them a lot of money on top of that . 
  throwing water to a bottomless bucket is an appropriate image here . 
  european countries seem slow to realise this , however . 
  they appear to still think the `` globalisation '' is only over their internal eu market ... 
  but they may have . 
  remember , `` undetected '' . 
  some finely manufactured robots may be doing press conferences right now without anyone noticing . 
  that would explain many odd things about current politics ... 
    g3  fancy that , we use the same rifles . 
  [ same here and also these countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_g3#users ) * the g3 is still a fine weapon , after 60 years of good service . 
  solid german design . 
  still no point in changing it for those newfangled 5.56 mm toys : 7.62 x51 nato packs more punch . 
  any instructions on how to report `` illegal '' and `` black market '' sales ? 
  i guess smugglers will have to fill vat forms from now on ? 
  ( surely must be a joke ... 
  but unfortunately nowadays it even sounds plausible ), 
  * rock in rio . 
  rolling stones played for 90000 . edit : `` rock in rio in lisbon '' , of course . 
   russia , ** bearly ** any news i see what you did there . 
  but slice him in half ? 
  that 's rough , man . 
   ~ ~ colleagues ~ ~ cousins ftfy, 
  portugal is also divided seaside vs. inland . 
  not sure we 're shittier than the others ... 
  in your link , italy , portugal and germany all have worse gini index than the usa . 
  the best is south korea . 
  so , i 'm not seeing europe doing too well here . 
  dude , what the hell , man ? 
  ? - ) i agree with everything you say , except , as i said in another post , i was not blaming anything or anyone , just looking at the facts ( hard numbers ) and trying to understand them . 
  perhaps we would be worse without the euro ? 
  maybe . 
  would we be worse without the eu ? 
  almost sure . 
  but the numbers say that what we 're doing in the last 14 years must have something wrong . 
  i can only see the euro as the difference . 
  please notice the graph again , 1995-2000 . 
  portugal 's growth was 4.1 % ( four point one ) yearly over that period . 
  then see 2000-2013 . 
  something is going on here . 
  i think we were simply not ready to enter that wealthy gentlemen 's club that is the euro . 
  we were like that country cousin who managed to get admission to the club just for being family with some member , then had to spend all his income just buying acceptable clothes and tipping the doorman . 
  or if you want another crappy analogy : we were the fat-bellied couch potato who was accepted to the euro train , pulled by olympic athletes . 
  problem was , since it was evident the couch potato would not be pulling anything , they just strapped him behind the train with a noose around his arms . 
  since they really run ( ok , they all stumbled and fell on top of each other around 2008 , but they just got back to their feet and started running again ) , the current situation of that poor fellow could be predicted in advance : unable to run since his arms are tied , he 's being dragged on the road , on his face . 
  edit : a word . 
  perhaps . 
  but economists opinions vary ( e.g. 
  see p. krugman ) . 
  i was going to write `` thanks for the kind words '' then i noticed your flair . 
  dude ... that 's not cool . 
  :-) ( i think we 'll pick up , not because we have much going for us at the moment , but because 900 years tell us we always do . 
  not blaming anybody , just saying something is n't working for us . 
   ignoring the massive recession and economic crisis , before that all economies were growing nicely under the euro . 
  sorry , but not all . 
  let 's look at an above-all-suspicion germany so you do n't say i 'm blaming anything/anyone . 
  ignore the recession and just look at the 2000-2008 period . 
  see ? 
  1.4 % growth in average does not look as `` nice '' to me . 
  oh , and please notice a thing that surprised me in the portugal 's graph : it 's really almost flatlined since 2000 , 2008-present just dived a little more . 
  very unlike most others . 
  cool , it works with other countries . 
  let 's just see mine : eu vs. portugal ( portugal/eu ) : * 1995 - 66 % * 2000 - 70 % * 2013 - 62 % the gap is widening ... 
  the so called `` convergence '' turned out to be simple political rubbish . 
  and eu did give money to aid with it . 
  * gdppp 2000 = 14500 $ * gdppp 2013 = 14300 $ wow . 
  since income equality has been * reduced * in this period , this surprisingly ( for me ) confirms the thesis that most people here is becoming poorer . 
  it 's not just a lost decade for us , it now appears it will turn out 2 decades . 
  looks like the euro , the eu , or both , are n't working for us ... 
   there was massive immigration from italy , spain and later portugal in the 30s , 50s and 60s . 
  you should do some research before speaking . 
  you should too ; apparently you do n't know about gaul ( gallia ) being conquered by an italian dude called julius caesar and his band of immigrants ... all this before 1930 . 
  * ps : please fix your irony/sarcasm detector . 
  as a portuguese , it 's hard for me to write anything without it . 
  i do try ... *, 
  sorry for the blot in the map : for us cocaine is still too expensive . 
  of course , e being the `` predominant stimulant '' here does n't say much about drugs use . 
  other types of drugs are far more used , like * cannabis * . 
   they seem to forget people used to complain the portuguese or the italians did n't integrate when they first arrived so , when did they first arrive , in your opinion ? 
  those italians would be the infamous roman legions that bothered so many people around i b.c. ? 
  about the portuguese , i 'm curious . 
  if you are thinking about the 1960 's emigrants , i always heard they integrated so seamlessly as to never being a concern -- contrary , e.g. , to the french returning from algeria . 
  of course , those who visited the * bidonvilles * around paris and other major cities of the era could doubt of such `` integration '' , but probably not in the way you implied ... ( today , the portuguese in france do n't live there ) . 
   pj is n't the same as undercover psp . 
  if you want to underline there were two different branches involved , you may use these acronyms or say `` criminal police '' or `` judiciary police '' for pj , fellow redditors will surely recognise those terms . 
  thanks for the links !,
