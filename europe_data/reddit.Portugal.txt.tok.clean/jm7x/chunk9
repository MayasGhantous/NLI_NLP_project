  important stuff indeed ... 
  well , i was thinking of today , not in cold war times ... `` western europe '' did have that `` non-communist europe '' meaning then ( 25 years ago , * tempus fugit * ! ) . 
  nowadays , it does n't seem to have many uses . 
  well , at least in european media ... 
  i think you should save some of these news for the next issue ; this one was for the week ending in 25-5 , as i understand . 
  just some questions/nitpicks :  regular police tow away secret police car while on an operation . 
  i think you meant `` undercover police '' , right ? 
  pide/dgs are fortunately long gone ...  $ 30 billion worth of tax evasion ( ... ) renewables subsidy to be put into place again ( ... ) these look very interesting . 
  sources ? 
  otoh , nobody says `` western europe '' . 
  strange ... 
  you called ? 
  wine is good for your health !, 
  not just `` alcohol '' , it must be wine ... just do n't drink too much of it in one go , only drink during meals and you should be fine . 
  red wine , surprisingly , seems to reduce heart disease risks . 
  which you see nicely confirmed by the green in the map . 
   only if you 're considering just the population of lisbon 's municipality . 
  yes . 
  some 800 000 , i think . 
  ** portugal ** * ep election : record abstention for any kind of nation-wide elections ( 66 % ) . 
  * for a couple days , lisbon looked like a spanish town ( well , madrid ) . 
  some 20 % increase in population at least , but gone by sunday :-) oh , and real madrid won the cup , 4-1 over atl\u00e9tico . 
  '' - it 's good to be the king ! '', 
  til ... 
  i was n't trying to pass for a belgian , anyway . 
  yes , i think you are probably right on the mark there . 
  i was reading too much into this :-), 
  well , it 's only anecdotal , and it was  20 years ago , but i 'm thinking of the employee at the train ticket booth explicitly correcting me : my destination was n't `` bruxelles '' , but `` brussel '' . 
  note : french people normally understand my french , and i think he understood correctly ... also please do n't read that `` half '' too literally anyway . 
  never thought much of it ; always used french + english in bruxelles with nice results . 
  1st time i visited brussels i was totally ignorant of these matters , so i was a bit confused that when i tried to speak to people in french , half of them were very friendly ; the others not so much , and answered immediately in english ... 
  unfortunately , i did n't know any dutch ( still do n't ... ) , so , to avoid too much awkwardness , i quickly decided to only use english to start a conversation . 
  ( switching to french later if appropriate ;-), 
  thanks for the thought . 
  the uk did bail us out in 1894 with a generous 100 years loan ( it was `` kingdom of portugal '' then ) . 
  i guess we were too shy to ask for another one less than 20 years after the last downpayment of the last one ... 
  i 'm sure your terms would not be as harsh as those of eu+imf . 
  anyway , we still consider the uk our closest friend and ally . 
  cheers !, 
  bbc chose a different title . 
  i thought this one was more to point , though . 
  tl ; dr : [ best european destination : portugal , selected by readers of usa today ] ( http://redd.it/25los2 ) ( / r/portugal ) our west neighbours favour us too much ... 
  thanks america !, 
  thank you for noticing this . 
  i apologise ; did n't explain myself very clearly . 
  i was exaggerating perhaps the role of auto europa , in not mentioning both peugeot-citroen and renault , but what you say is not what i meant : the 9 % is the addition of `` cars '' and `` vehicle parts '' . 
  those 3 car factories make and export cars , but i 'm not sure about vehicle parts . 
  i think the `` vehicle parts 4,1 % '' you see is instead exported by the associated industries ( several thousand businesses ) that supply the 3 car factories . 
  my point is i 'm certain those would hardly exist if there was no volkswagen/auto europa here . 
  that 's why i boldly added 4,9 +4,1 to come to that awesome number for the car industry ( all 3 mentioned this time ! ) . 
  * ps : again , these are not agricultural products . 
  i think . 
  * * ps2 : decimal commas , yes . 
  sue me . 
  do n't discount auto europa , look at those 4,9 % of all our exports !, 
  and it 's the main reason for the other 4,1 % in `` vehicle parts '' !, 
  so , in fact an awesome 9 % of portugal exports . 
  i had no idea ... 
  me neither . 
  we just do n't export food , we import more than half of all we eat . 
  i think we do export some like tomato products or wine ( not exactly `` food '' , but anyway ) . 
  but agricultural products like cork are n't food . 
  just yesterday came the stats of the gnp for the 1st quarter , and growth is negative : -0,7 % relative to last quarter of 2013 . 
  main reason : sines refinery stopped production for maintenance for a few weeks . 
  portugal exports value down the drain ... 
  i think one of the main products is gasoline for the usa , strangely enough ... 
  thanks . 
  top 5 products exported by portugal : 1 . 
  refined petroleum ( 5.9 % ) , 1 . 
  cars ( 4.9 % ) , 1 . 
  vehicle parts ( 4.1 % ) , 1 . 
  leather footwear ( 3.2 % ) , 1 . and uncoated paper ( 2.6 % ) that 's more like it . 
  it seems to only go up to 2011 , however . 
  may be inaccurate today . 
  perhaps they meant that since the site says : `` portugal is the top exporter of agglomerated cork , natural cork articles , debacked cork , and hat forms . '', 
  but i think `` hat forms '' are hardly agricultural products . 
  and `` agglomerated cork '' does n't grow in trees . 
  nor `` natural cork articles '' either . 
  let 's debunk these lies about portugal i see spread in this sub all the time . 
  it makes me question the info i see about the other countries as well , of course . 
  my downvote to this submission then . 
  i suspect this problem is n't exclusive of the uk ... ^ ( * that 's called `` ironic understatement '' for the irony impaired * ) media and its paying public are in a runaway loop : the first trying to only convey things that `` please '' the audience in the most alarming and negative way possible ( so that the news get some attention ) ; the public swallowing all the above as `` facts '' , tilting its opinions just a little in the `` catastrophe '' direction ... party politics , unfortunately , feed in this loop . 
  there seems no politically significant group is interested in telling the truth or speaking about facts or real numbers about the important stuff to the people ... 
  it worries me that this appears to exist in all western democracies , and we ca n't really find a good model to follow :-(, 
   yes , devaluation is basically a hidden wage cut , and a hidden price cut in exports , in order to be able to sell more . 
  this is really the only way how to get out of a recession with high unemployment portugal here ; beg to disagree a bit : although still with high unemployment , we got out of a recession with no devaluations ( our coin is the euro ) . 
  let 's see the differences : * no hidden wage cuts . 
  glaring wage cuts . 
  * brutal tax increases . 
  * no idea if exports got ( explicit ) price cuts , but we do export much more now . 
  since internal spending dropped sharply ( see above ) , exports are the only resort for most businesses . 
  * imports dropped . 
  having no money , you do n't buy stuff . 
  simple . 
  really , i think devaluation would only make this process much less transparent . 
  i guess the outcome would be essentially the same : many businesses closing leading to unemployment , almost everyone poorer . 
  let me repeat the high unemployment part , really the most dramatic consequence of all the crisis . 
  it 's here to stay . 
  there 's much more to it , of course . 
  this economics stuff is really too complex for me to understand .
