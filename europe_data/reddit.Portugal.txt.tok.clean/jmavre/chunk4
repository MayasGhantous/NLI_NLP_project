  education fixes ignorance , not stupidity . 
  you ca n't fix stupid nor crazy . 
  ever . 
   i make use of my right to remain silent not that simple . 
  we only grant that right to someone with the `` arguido '' status . 
  it was something that the brits just could n't wrap their heads around during the madie fiasco . 
  of course you can ask for that status during the investigation , but your freedom will be curtailed . 
  you 'll at the very least have to communicate any change of residence longer than 5 days and a judge may place far more restrictive measures . 
   so does w . that explains so much ... 
  da fuck did i just watch ? 
   why is the anger of religious people worth more than the anger of irreligious ? 
  because irreligious people do n't usually go around breaking shit when someone insults them . 
  no need to `` protect '' them if there are no consequences . 
  and these are the same countries that give you guys shit about lack of freedom and basic rights in turkey . 
  ridiculous !, 
  these laws have got to go !, 
   none of the portuguese characters on the map ? 
  none are considered independent letters . 
  just letters modified by a diacritic . 
  you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_orthography#alphabet_in_spanish ) that in spanish \u00f1 is its own letter . 
   and do n't forget laws against leaders in general we have those and a guy was prosecuted a few years ago because he called the president a clown . 
  he was prosecuted/charged in record time too . 
  this can not be stressed enough . 
  step on a thb note , even inadvertently , you are now fucked because you stepped on the king 's image . 
  and it is enforced , though to this level not always . 
  while in thailand , stfu about anything monarchy related or just ask very innocuous questions and listen . 
   if he bans apples & pens as well japan will let him be our prime minister . 
  an suddenly the [ oppai pen song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bm3qosfry ) makes ( a bit ) more sense ...

  [ yang estern european artist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqmfr8nn_l8 ), 
  which other monarchies in europe still have `` l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 '' laws in the books ? 
  i know thailand is particularly brutal when it comes to this . 
  you tell us . 
  the girl i met 6 months ago said so . 
  never had it but it would probably be amazing . 
  just cook it in the oven . 
  the salt and sweet is probably very good . 
  the word you are looking for starts with zoo . 
   the warning shots were n't warning shots but the police missed . 
  this makes all the difference !, 
   i know this sounds like some far right argument against social housing which its not this is totally generalizable . 
  fix people 's computer stuff for free , they will nag you forever , complain that it was shit and blame every new problem on your intervention . 
  if they pay for it they 'll feel more content about the end result ( even if lower quality ) and will not associate new problems to that intervention . 
  this is why you should never help people for free . 
  thanks . 
  makes sense . 
  i thought you meant venus and i was getting very confused . 
  i 'm only familiar with the first meaning . 
  you are right .

   i guess he could remove himself from the succession by becoming a catholic you ca n't make this shit up . 
   he has some pretty ~ ~ weird ~ ~ * wrong * ideas around homeopathy, 
  the bull certainly is n't missing anything ... 
  is there a 2nd round in france ? 
  guide pineapple . 
   i really wish someone would start a `` serious '' conversation with people such as her , and ask why they carry it as a pet . 
  and this is how you get maced . 
  you ca n't fix crazy and you ca n't fix stupid . 
  you just walk away ... 
   only said hello preposterous in scandinavia . 
  how dare you ? 
   this misuse of the term ` ironic ' is getting painful so what word would you prefer being used here ? 
   also thought there would be more brazilians than angolans in portugal i 'm pretty sure that is the case . 
  edit : i 'm right .

   i could n't even begin to imagine what it would be like to be told by some stupid general to march into those walls . 
  it would be like being spanish , 
   did it see any action ? 
  i think so . 
  it 's right next to the border with spain and near a piece that is still disputed . 
   dutch jesuit padre jo\u00e3o pisc\u00e1sio typical dutch name .

  san francisco =  san tiago, 
  and do n't forget that cultural powerhouse . 
  faro in southern portugal . 
  faro ?!,

   `` nossa senhora '' has no translation ; if you try to translate it to `` our lady '' sounds weird ... that 's the actual translation . 
  how did you go up ?

  empad\u00e3o is made from the others patron 's leftovers . 
  just so you know ... 
  i swam in the ocean on jan 1st 2016 in the algarve and it felt ok . 
   what is the thought process ( if any ) behind those behaviors ... ?

  they have n't learned from their western sisters that they can have their cake and eat it too . 
  i new it . 
  the mfo as been keeping me up at night since the usa election ... 
  no joke .
