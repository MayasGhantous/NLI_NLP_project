good question . 
  you tell me , what is lisbon known for ? 
  asplund 's touch of genius . 
  only skogskyrkog\u00e5rden to make me want to spend some time in a cemetery . 
  do you know what that structure 's use would be ? 
  is it just aesthetic ? 
  enclosing that metal structure ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  are the boarding platforms under that red space ? 
  wo n't it get too chilly there in the winter ? 
  i 'm not saying that was the only reason the prague bridge cost more , there are many reasons . 
  but even if they were both built in the same country by the same people , and there were no problems during construction of either , the czech bridge would still cost more per meter . 
  you just have to look at it , the design is more expensive , i 'm sure the finishing is also better seeing that it 's in a touristic destiantion . 
  to be sure , i meant landmark in a more loose kevin lynch way not as a national or city icon . 
  they are n't angry at anything . 
  this is just cameron pandering to the more populism susceptible among the right . 
  the bridge in prague was also meant to be an urban landmark , that 's also why it cost so much more . 
  how about you get down from your high horse ? 
  you really got me man , me and all my hundred thousand other personalities . 
  because most are tired of that joke ? 
  i know i am , and i do n't even have to listen to it in my country . 
  yeah , the most famous by far , it even made the news here . 
  [ grana padano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grana_padano ) , [ edammer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edam_cheese ) and a home cured local cheese from , i believe , the azorean terceira island , i 've got no clue what it 's name is , as i get it from my sister 's fiance 's father . 
  this is the epitome of ` old but gold ' . 
  to be fair , it 's warmer than usual for this time of the year . 
  i guess it 's just an untimely [ st. martin 's summer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_martin%27s_summer ) . 
  it 's a thing , i 've heard it although i say the other way . 
  [ \u02c8ew\u027e\u0254 ] or [ \u02c8ew\u027eu ] actually . 
  there are two versions . 
  i 'll take it as a compliment . 
  soon to be . 
  is it that obvious ? 
  he was a fantastic and original author but he would never be able to win a nobel , he had very few works published while he was alive and most of his works were only discovered and published after his death - we are actually still discovering some to this day - and because the nobel only awards living people it would have meant that he would 've won just because of a handful of poems . 
  * [ zumthor 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_zumthor ) , whatever the name of the style is * [ school of porto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_of_porto ) * [ bauhaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bauhaus ), 
  portugal has only two nobel prize laureates , egas moniz and jos\u00e9 saramago . 
  ramos-horta and d. ximenes belo are east timorese . 
  i would n't . 
  [ mvrdv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3le15ayt5g ), 
  obviously not true . 
  people down in alentejo for example do n't really give a fuck about religion * . 
  i 'm not really sure where the bible belt would be though . 
  * altough in its coastal areas there is a quite above average interest in `` alternative '' spiritualism and occultism . 
  edit : i found this [ survey ] ( http://www.snpcultura.org/catolicismo_e_outras_identidades_religiosas_em_portugal.html ) from 2012 with some data divided by second level nuts regions . 
  lisbon is the least religious region followed by the algarve and alentejo . 
  the most religious region is norte followed closely by centro . 
  unsurprising when you think about where these regions stand on morality issues . 
   spanish region that meaning for spain as disappeared long ago though . 
  he used spain as a synonym of iberia , which would n't be too absurd many centuries ago before castille-aragon adopted that name for their union . 
  that 's a word . 
  i 'm sure they did . 
  they 're quite different from spanish , especially basque which is n't even in the same family . 
   plus those closer to france can also likely speak french and those closer to portugal portuguese while we only have one border , that does n't really make much sense when you think about it . 
  it would be all about the percentage of people living close to a border , the number of borders would n't really matter . 
  that is the only study i can find , the university of salamanca one . 
  i have doubts about it 's credibility , because as i said , i do n't think i 've ever met anyone who wants it , and i lived all my life in portugal . 
  i know it 's anecdotal evidence , but still , it 's plenty of anecdotal evidence . 
  btw , i think of myself as an hispanophile , having inclusively learned spanish , and i certainly do n't support it . 
   in portugal  i think it 's about 35 % . 
  i 've never seen the numbers but i 'm sure it 's not even close to that . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met anyone who wants it . 
  damn !, 
  reading all this stories makes me feel so boring about my heritage . 
  all the places i can trace my heritage from are closer than 150km from where i was born and lived all my life . 
  no love for [ eros ramazzotti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etokcxiujge ) ? 
  hijacking your comment . 
  the best time is probably late spring/early summer . 
  it 's still not too hot and it 's when the festas populares happen . 
  come on over , it 's cheap . 
  move somewhere else , we 're cheap . 
  the line that separates a potential country from a group of nutjobs might be a blurry one , but that does n't make reduction to absurdity a valid argument . 
   \u2022 desfiladero de despe\u00f1aperros - gorge of throwing-dogs-down-the-cliff . 
  ftfy . 
  a defiler is a someone who defiles . 
  you probably meant defile the noun , but no one would get that you meant a gorge by it . 
   poortugaal what is this place ? 
  even their [ flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/vlag_poortugaal.png ) resembles ours !, 
  economically , technologically , educationally and socially repressive dictartorships in nato ? 
  nonsense !, 
  you mean the `` let 's give it an old historical '' middle class hipster name or the most popular names regardless of any connotations ? 
  f\u00e1tima , the place where this happened , was named after a moorish princess . 
  the same thing happens in portugal with all the baby rodrigos , martins and santiagos . 
  it probably derives from the possibly latin name of a pre-roman tribe , the [ vascones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vascones ) . 
  where this tribe 's name comes from i have no idea . 
  the last rocky patch made us adopt an [ anthem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_portuguesa ) based on an anti-british song . 
  i hope this one sparks your creativity likewise . 
  fried fish is far from uncommon in portugal , the author should be used to it , but then again i have never eaten your fish and chips so i 'm not aware of any differences to our dishes that might have made him dislike it . 
  what 's up with portugal being shaded brown ? 
  there 's no church tax here . 
   and do not deign themselves to at least try speak a bit of spanish elder british tourists , please come instead to portugal , we 'll thank you if you do n't speak spanish to us . 
  it 's not that far from the truth actually . 
  portugal first came to be with the [ emancipation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s%c3%a3o_mamede ) of [ our first king ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_i_of_portugal ) from his [ pro-leonese mother ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theresa,_countess_of_portugal ) . 
  those damn old iberian ladies !, 
  that and showering infrequently too . 
  you would expect the first meeting to start at 9h15 and the second one to start at 10h30 . 
  the delay will vary with the formality of the meeting though , if you 're going to dine with a large group of friends you should n't be surprised if it only starts with a delay of an hour or more . 
  meetings on weekends tend to usually have a greater delay too . 
  this does n't mean that there wo n't be persons who arrive on time for the meetings by the way , it 's just that most do n't . 
  someone has to go over some portuguese history again ... 
  texturewise it 's like eating other molluscs like octopi , squids or bivalves . 
  tastewise it tastes mostly as the sauce they 're prepared in , usually a refogado ( olive oil , garlic and onion ) with spices and herbs like oregano , laurel , pepper and a bit of piri-piri .
