  i do n't know where you 're from but are all the houses there that bad ? 
  edit : who the fuck is the sad sap who keeps downvoting me over such a mild discussion ? 
  sadly , for most things , that 's not how it works . 
  nothing like staying indoors / drinking a cold beer / siestaing through the hottest hours ca n't solve . 
  that might just mean that spanish authorities do a poor job cleaning grafitti . 
  has it ever been proposed to the unesco by the greek authorities ? 
  unesco only approves the sites , they do n't come forth with them as far as i know . 
  because i 'm from lisbon and of the places in spain the weather is the most like lisbon , catalonia seems to be the best off economically . 
  galicia shares a bit more cultural ties with portugal but not to the point it justifies moving to that cold , wet place instead of catalonia . 
  it 's still a beautiful place to visit though . 
  catalonia , tuscany , southern california , new south wales/queensland , rio de janeiro or southern brazil . 
  they are probably the most like home . 
  shit liqueur , implying it 's made whit shit . 
  i had never heard of it but apparently it started out has political criticism back in the 70s but the product was so good it kept selling . 
  from what i gather from the ingredients list it 's just a run of the mill * licor de leite * , milk liqueur , which is in fact made with several other ingredients alongside milk , like cocoa , vanilla , cinnamon , citrus , etc. 
  my grandfather used to make it at home , it 's very mild and sweet compared to other liqueurs . 
  most of northern portugal plus inner central portugal [ has little earthquake risk ] ( http://portal.share-eu.org:8080/opencms/export/sites/default/share/.content/share-images/mean_sa000_rp475_nologo.png ) , nuclear power plants could be built in those areas . 
  nuclear power potential is just not that competitive when compared to large hydro and to an extent , solar and wind . 
  edit : my bad , did n't see you used basically the same map in another comment . 
  you should quit being angry and just come over . 
  well , when you control the lonely central archipelago in the middle of the north atlantic you 're bound to get some perks off it . 
  does n't he have irish ancestry ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.musica-portuguesa-gratis.com/images/quim-barreiros-o-bilau-2011.jpg ) , basically . 
  or [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5ic2pjyxvdg/s8zwuy4_sri/aaaaaaaaaea/pt9x1n1yxvk/s1600/bigodes.jpg ) . 
   i 'm irish , and i 've found ireland to be no more religious than the uk , and much less so than spain/italy/portugal . 
  [ except you 're not much less religious than italy or spain . 
  you 're actually more religious than spain . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2ckvuv/percentages_of_people_in_european_countries_who/ ), 
  ah , thanks for the explanation !, 
  let me play the devil 's advocate to try to understand this better . 
  pp said that they did n't want andalusia to be ruled by catalans , not spain , that does make some sense though does n't it ? 
  andalusians should be governed by andalusians in their own region , they are the ones who are more in contact with the hopes and struggles of the andalusian people . 
  it 's different from saying andalusians should n't vote for catalans to govern the whole spanish nation . 
  i tought you only had to invest $ 0,5 m here to get those golden visas . 
  this is the first book by simon i 'm reading . 
  i really like the way he writes , he 's no gabo m\u00e1rquez but he 's surprisingly good . 
  i do n't think so , many of the players in that team would be playing together for the first time for that game while the opposing team would necessarily have players more used to playing with each other . 
  in general i agree . 
  but i would love it - and we could do it already without federalisation - if there was a football european union representative team that played friendlies from time to time , say , every year on europe day for example , against a top non-eu national team . 
  the green represents our hopes for the future - green is the colour of hope in portugal - and red represents the blood of the patriots who died defending the country . 
  bollocks . 
  utter nonsense . 
  our flag is green and red because those were the colours of the [ portuguese republican party ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/7776/4188/1600/725016/fim-monarquia.jpg ) who changed the flag after the republican revolution back in 1910 that put an end to our monarchy . 
  ` the corner : a year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood ' by david simon, 
  the portuguese communist party has actually a very good reputation when it comes to local governance . 
  i 'm not surprised they would score well when it comes to that , despite not understanding exactly what this study is measuring . 
  it 's hard to tell . 
  i was pretty young when the schengen area was introduced so i do n't really remember ever having to show my passport at our border . 
  i guess i felt it first when i travelled with my parents in the benelux , germany and france , in the late 90s or early 2000s . 
  we went to five different countries , crossed multiple borders and no one gave the slightest fuck about who i was . 
  that made me feel pretty much like i belonged . 
  yet the situation that probably made me feel the most like an european was on the 1st of january of 2002 . 
  i remember i woke up very soon and went out in the cold with my dad trying to find an atm to get our first ever euro banknotes , and an open place to spend our first few euros . 
  i remember thinking about all those other persons from finland , to greece , to germany all using their euros for the first time too , just like us . 
  i bet he/she watches rt too , i have had pcp supporters telling me it 's the most unbiased news source . 
  and politically i tend to vote more to the left , but i really ca n't identify with some of those guys , they are just soviet ` nostalgists ' / conspiracy theorists . 
  the portuguese communist party historically has had very strong ties to the soviet union . 
  but it 's a minority party , and it 's very far from having enough support to win national elections . 
  i guess you were just extremely ( un ) lucky to only ever have met pcp supporters . 
  that 's just the gypsies , did n't you know ? 
  among the congo pygmies and where else ? 
  actually the vandals did vandalise through iberia on their way to africa . 
  portugal hard for z\u00fcrich !, 
  from my experience , and let me underline that this is only anecdotal evidence , younger generations are much more fluent in english than the previous generations were in french - probably because there was a shift from french to english as the most popular lingua franca in the country during their lifetimes . 
   spain , right next to portugal and france ( two related languages ! ), 
  with a 1.7 ? 
  you are overplaying the similarity between the romance languages . 
  while portuguese and spanish are indeed quite similar , french is n't similar to either . 
  as a portuguese , spanish and english speaker , with a little knowledge of french and german , i find the germanic languages ( other than english ) much more similar between them than the romance languages . 
  while that is certainly a reason - as a portuguese speaker you can lead a thriving international business based on the huge markets of brazil , angola and mozambique - i believe the vast majority of portuguese come in contact with non-portuguese speakers regularly in their professional lives , so i doubt that 's the most important cause . 
  this is still probably a consequence of the estado novo 's protectionism and also of our extremely aged population . 
  from my experience most young portuguese ( ~ under 35 ) speak at least two languages , many speak three or more , unlike the older generations . 
  til that the portuguese word for pomegranate - rom\u00e3 - comes from arabic . 
  edit : and yes , i know plenty more words in our vocabulary come from arabic , i just never suspected rom\u00e3 to be one of them , it did n't sound like it . 
   * hundeluft ( dog 's air )  * katzenhirn ( cat 's brain ) should n't these translate to * dogs ' air * and * cats ' brain * instead ? 
  i started learning german just some weeks ago so i 'm still going through my first steps . 
   the only difference between a greek person and a portuguese person is the portuguese person has hope . 
  no we do n't . 
  we are just in denial . 
  my crocodile tears ? 
  i care more for 200 than for one million ? 
  assuming much , are n't we ? 
  and what if in that hypothetical scenario the iraqis who were against the war did indeed try to topple the government but failed ? 
  what if they did n't even try because they knew they would fail ? 
  would they lose their right to complain for it ? 
  why would they not have any right to complain ? 
  they would , and they should !, 
  it does n't matter if it 's innocent iraqis or spaniards being blown up for things they might have opposed . 
  obviously they did n't , but i have n't seen anyone in here saying that iraqis do n't have the right to complain , unlike what you said about the spaniards . 
  and what if there is ? 
  was his post that preposterous ? 
  if you cross a road with a lot of movement or whitout looking if there 's oncoming traffic , yeah , it can be . 
  the galician wiki calls it [ anan\u00e1s ] ( https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/anan%c3%a1s ) too . 
  i swear , of all the nationalities i come across here on reddit , canadians are the ones who act the most like a stereotype . 
  why on earth would you apologise for the quality of the map you used for that joke ? 
  yeah , it 's even more difficult when you ca n't just import new ones because no else has [ your kind ] ( http://www.radiomonsanto.pt/ficheiros/noticias/1286372045lince.jpg ) . 
  i 'm totally talking out of my ass here , but that area is very dry and has very few forests that help prevent erosion . 
  might be the reason why it 's a lot smoother than the rest . 
  the fact that geologically it 's dominated by [ sediments of the current era ] ( http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-maps-geological/12mps-geology-map-western-europe.jpg ) supports this thesis i believe . 
  i 'm always surprised with how similar galician and portuguese are , especially the written forms .
