  [ no , it 's not .

  the frontier is still in the bridge . 
  i 'm not even brazilian portuguese and i miss it too . 
  it 's the one thing i would have introduced from brazilian orthography to european pt orthography . 
  and now they took it from both of us . 
  not really no . 
  our orthography changed more because it kept more of it 's etymological origins but theirs got fucked up too . 
  went there for the first time last september , to the beautiful terceira island . 
  not only is the place breathtaking i ate like a motherfucker too , their seafood and their beef are out of this world . 
  the weather is very predictable . 
  you get all the seasons in a single day , every day . 
  the veto ca n't remain if the parliament passes the same law a second time . 
  [ yum ] ( http://www.mardanoruega.com/recipes/portugal/bacalhau-com-todos ), 
  so , i guess this as good proof as any that we are a rich powerful country . 
  olivenza/oliven \u00e7a is another matter for portuguese irredentists , since they feel that the city is legitimately portuguese . 
  it 's very unlike galicia , whose nobility portugal [ fought for it 's independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s%c3%a3o_mamede ) . 
   portugalicia is only relevant among portuguese nationalists portugalicia is irrelevant among portuguese nationalists, 
  the alentejo got actually [ slightly larger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) . 
  yeah , the [ shoe industry in portugal ] ( http://www.portugueseshoes.pt/ ) in particular is pretty big . 
  as a soon to be architect i find that project silly and gimmicky . 
  and the spaniards did n't incorporate them ? 
  that 's very similar to my case . 
  i 'm from lisbon , speak portuguese natively , english fluently , spanish ( proper spanish , not portu\u00f1ol ) quasi-fluently and i started learning german one year ago , i can only hold a simple conversation so far . 
  i also know the basics in french although i would n't say i can speak or understand much of it . 
   you would n't find houses like that being used as public housing for the locals in need . 
  i do n't know man , contemporary social housing in portugal is pretty nice , i guess if your are thinking about social housing from the 60s through the 90s it can be pretty dismal , although even in that era there were some amazing social housing projects , like many of the saal process during the prec years . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/economia/os-10-concelhos-mais-pobres-de-portugal-que-todos-os-ministros-deviam-conhecer/ ) from 2013 the poorest municipality in portugal was [ sernancelhe ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=sernancelhe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewju68r6oa_jahxfobokham1booq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955 ) , but that 's just a small village . 
  the poorest city , by the official definition in portugal , was [ valpa\u00e7os ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=valpa%c3%a7os&amp;hl=en-pt&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjsg-drsq_jahvdcbokhcbqdhmq_auibigb ) . 
  he went away , this article is already two weeks old . 
  the new pm has been appointed and will be sworn in on friday . 
  including the high speed rail line connecting two of the three largest cities in the peninsula ? 
  edit : btw i do n't see the connection between that strike and poor investments in new rail lines . 
  that article says they went on strike because an agreement could n't be reached in regards to collective bargaining , human resources and their hiring policies . 
  what 's you point ? 
  yes , in that case it was n't needed , it was a terrible investment . 
  but we are n't talking about that airport are we ? 
  we are talking about a bridge that will be used in the future high speed rail line between madrid and lisbon . 
  that railway line will need plenty of expensive infrastructures in the middle of nowhere like this bridge . 
  you know that being built in an underpopulated area does n't necessarily mean it 's not needed ? 
  one day this bridge will be used to connect madrid and lisbon by high speed train . 
  it 's not exactly a white elephant . 
  and constructing bridges in the middle of nowhere is necessary in iberia since there are so many empty areas in between the big cities . 
  i thought it would be either [ soldado milh\u00f5es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an%c3%adbal_milhais ) or [ afonso de albuquerque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_de_albuquerque ) . 
  also xavier or hern\u00e2ni . 
  tbf , they probably got around as much as everyone else in iberia , it 's just that their names are more conspicuous than the rest . 
  if a rodrigues moved to spain he might change his name to rodr\u00edguez since they are so similar , and it 's harder to tell where exactly in the peninsula each name started . 
  in portugal we have at least : franco ( frank ) ingl\u00eas ( english ) m\u00e2ntua ( mantova , italy ) arag\u00e3o ( aragon , spain ) vasques ( son of vasco or basque ) vasconcelos ( basque ) mourinho/moura/mour \u00e3o ( moor ) \u00c1vila ( \u00c1vila , spain ) samora ( zamora , spain ) biscaia ( biscay , spain ) romana , rom\u00e3o ( roman ) albuquerque ( albuquerque , spain ) china ( china ) de holanda ( holland , netherlands - more common in brazil ) alorna ( alorna , goa ) de lencastre ( lancaster , england ) my own last name comes from the name of a small village somewhere in galicia , but that is a bit like cheating since galician and portuguese have always been pretty close , a great number of portuguese surnames of toponymic origin are galician-portuguese . 
  we probably also use \u00ef , but it 's not the case of na\u00efve . 
  [ na\u00efve ] ( https://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/na%c3%afve ) is [ not ] ( http://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/lingua-portuguesa/na%c3%afve ) a word in portuguese . 
  we actually do use it but only in words of foreign origin like [ m\u00fclleriano ] ( http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/m%c3%bclleriano ) . 
  no , they are n't divided in regions unlike the others that are divided in nuts1 regions . 
  you can read it in the map 's legend . 
  [ is n't it the same ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index ), 
  it 's a pity that the uk , france , germany and portugal are n't divided in regions . 
  was n't this the same study that put portugal behind spain last year ? 
  ** half ** of the us speaks spanish ** fluently ** ? 
  maybe it 's my problem . 
  maybe i 'm spoiled with our amazing towels and just do n't know it because i 've never used average quality towels . 
  well , obviously this applies to the obsession spaniards have with portuguese towels . 
  i do n't know what kind of shitty towels they have there that they all want to buy our perfectly normal towels here . 
  do a street art tour in lisbon . 
  he has a point though , portugal was for many decades one of the european countries with the smallest shares of building renovations compared to the total number of construction projects . 
  we simply ignored the old city centres and kept building urbanizations further into the countryside . 
  inwards in portugal . 
  it did n't have to be as pronounced as poland or germany , but even in an extremely homogeneous country like portugal [ political preferences correlate with geography ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gaukvjl.png ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/3qk9yh/resultados_das_legislativas_2015_por_concelhos_s%c3%b3/cwg6i1j ), 
  if by the part closer to russia you mean all of poland , than yes . 
  interesting how there does n't seem to exist any correlation between geography and political preferences . 
  except maybe for the purple dps , but even they are a bit all over the place . 
  you support benfica and porto ? 
  would she have been treated differently if she had another ideology ? 
  or is this law specifically protecting islamists ? 
  well , put yourself in be or pcp 's shoes . 
  would you rather have a ps government or a psd + cds government ? 
  be and pcp know that they do n't have the political strength to pass their most extremist ideas , but they would probably support the more idealogical akin ps in exchange of support for their most moderate ideas , do n't you think ? 
   to force you to return we were never part of spain . 
   nothing special happened here , everything was solved accordingly to the constitution and the votes of the people . 
  has anything been solved yet ? 
  last i heard we 'll have a government that is probably not going to last more than a week . 
  and after it falls who knows what will happen . 
   most of the people here were mad with what the leftists were doing , misusing their votes , not the decision of the president . 
  they were ? 
  are there any polls on the subject ? 
  they could have used the [ cplp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_of_portuguese_language_countries ) flag for portuguese , but since they are teaching brazilian portuguese specifically i think it 's better they used brazil 's . 
  you did n't hear tu/v \u00f3s in lisbon you heard tu/voc \u00eas , that 's the most common version here , only in inner central and northern portugal will you hear tu/v \u00f3s . 
  i would rather they called it brazilian . 
  the first and only time i tried to use duolingo as a portuguese native speaker , it corrected a perfectly valid sentence i wrote in portuguese just because i used phrasing that would never be used by a brazilian . 
  fu duo , i know portuguese better than you , who are you to tell me that sentence is wrong ?!, 
  since then i 've been a ` native ' english speaker there . 
   i have a different theory , namely that radical shift 's in the social and political sphere 's retard a nation 's prosperity . 
  which radical shifts are we talking about now ? 
  [ this ] ( http://guiastecnicos.turismodeportugal.pt/img/museus/47_palacio_nacional_de_mafra/l/palacio_mafra2.jpg ) is how we spent that brazilian gold . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker . 
  then what should i call the inhabitants of the american continent ? 
  in general . 
  it 's probably an american flaw in general , not just in the us . 
  it 's probably the americans fault , not only you . 
  do you have any data to support that ?
