  wtf ? 
  there 's even a portuguese shield there !, 
  how the hell did that happen ? 
  and it 's interesting how several of them were disillusioned , unsuccessful footballers . 
  the footballer bit is the least of it though , that only explains why they all moved from portugal to the uk were they became radicalised . 
   notably dutch royal family coming to canada it 's not exactly the same thing . 
  the portuguese crown still ruled brazil ( and many other territories around the world ) during european portugal 's occupation . 
   but even though he clearly had a boycrush on hitler i had a professor in university who , in his research , had access to some of [ pedro teot\u00f3nio pereira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_teot%c3%b3nio_pereira ) 's documents that pretty much confirmed that . 
  pedro teot\u00f3nio pereira was the one who made the connection between hitler and franco and presented them to eachother . 
  he was also a lover of the british queen mother btw . 
  like the jews ? 
   and portugal thoroughly destroyed the evil spaniards every single time . 
  that 's not true either . 
  all invasions were unsuccessful , both spanish invasions of portugal and portuguese invasions of spain . 
  that would be like getting in bed with a sibling . 
  finland is free to use our heraldic scraps . 
  why would we bother ? 
  i dislike it both in / r/portugal and irl but do n't bring it up . 
  it 's not one of the themes that people usually talk about , is it ? 
  it 's usually football , the weather and bitching about the government . 
  nonetheless they have come a long since the time they elected two mps , and my point was that those two mps were their foot in the door . 
  could you be any more ignorant of portuguese politics ? 
  looks like they are on their way to surpass pcp . 
  be only got two seats in their first election , but they bought them a place in the spotlight and they built on it . 
   so it 's also exploratory , to gain experience abroad . 
  or maybe they got better offers abroad despite having relatively good jobs in portugal ? 
  where is that study ? 
  given that one can buy facebook likes i would say no . 
  people in those areas are more inclined to vote for those parties , but many are surely still undecided either between cdu and ps or ps and psd . 
  it would be way more pointless for one of these parties to put up posters in places people are n't inclined to vote for them . 
  i think the weather affects all sides equally here . 
  alentejo votes pretty much just cdu and ps . 
  in coimbra and tomar it should be between ps and portugal \u00e0 frente ( psd + cds ) . 
  where were you staying ? 
  the amount of posters might have to do with those parties being more popular in that area . 
  and our most right wing party in the parliament is called ` centre ' , centro democr\u00e1tico e social . 
  most parties created after the fall of the right wing conservative dictatorship branded themselves more to the left to try to distance themselves from salazarism and i guess because relative to the previous regime they were indeed ` centrist ' or ` social democrats ' . 
  it does n't really make a difference do n't you think ? 
  it 's not about how many times you pay your employees per year , it 's about how much you pay them in total . 
  being paid twice per month instead of once is n't unheard of in many countries and i would n't think they are worst off economically . 
  this would be way more interesting if it was divided by knowledge areas . 
  dude . 
  [ anna santiago - vai anna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiqk3tlaoey ) to this day i still do n't know if it was meant to be a joke or not . 
  cod , right ? 
  nope, 
  sliced thinly ? 
  diced ? 
  cut in chunks ? 
   1 green pepper raw ? 
  here in portugal when we use green or red bell peppers in our salads they are usually the only cooked ingredient , [ we tend to grill and peel it first ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=pimentos&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi4qoej_2ayaivb2such2o_qwn#tbm=isch&amp;q=pimentos+assados ) . 
  it 's interesting how the french and iberian languages have names for switzerland that look more similar to the high german * suittes * than to the alemannic * schwiizer/schwyz * . 
  is c.c.s.s. 
  yes , i know . 
  do you have a source that their voters would ` almost all ' vote no in a referendum ? 
   and the voters are almost all no do you have a source on that ? 
  is that a fair point though ? 
  i do n't know close to enough about catalonia to know that but i suppose there are plenty of spaniards from other areas of the country living in barcelona these days . 
  sure . 
  just park somewhere in the atlantic , but please not right next to the azores ( or madeira ) like britain there . 
  it 's because in some areas in lithuanian the nickname for vilnius is `` portugal '' . 
  i have no idea why , but i remember there was a thread about it and google seems to confirm that idea . 
  and going by the images i can find on google vilnius does n't look much like anywhere in portugal , or at least not more than any other european city does . 
  you can pretend that 's what it 'll look like in 50 years . 
   portugal does n't have that advantage which is why you ca n't do whatever you want . 
  nor am i arguing portugal should . 
  my only point was that it 's disingenuous to bring up the downsides of being in the eu as a justification for that deficit while ignoring the upsides . 
  would n't you agree ? 
   its in portuguese but this is the socialist party ( party in government ) latest statement about this . 
  http://www.ps.pt/2016/10/25/opiniao-progressos-notaveis/ how does that prove that their mps are turning left ? 
  that reads much like i would expect ps propaganda to read . 
   but they are not anti-eu , ** they are anti-euro ** . 
  and anti this kind of union , that is capitalist in nature , and not as they say `` a true union for equality and generosity '' . 
  that is the narrative they will continue to push , and alot of people are agreeing with them , as seen in the polls . 
  the point still stands , the electorate immediately to their right is pro-eu and pro-euro , their growth is limited unless voters start changing their opinions in large numbers , and that does n't look like it 's happening . 
  the national budget only passes as well if the minority government party who wrote it wants to . 
  if the left wing parties stretch the rope too far the government falls . 
   and also alot of socialist mp 's are going left day by day as they see this working in the polls . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  i doubt the left wing will grow much more while still being anti-eu exactly because the electorate immediately to their right is pro-eu , unless the number of eurosceptics grows a lot . 
  is there anything that leads us to suspect that the number of eurosceptics in portugal is growing much ? 
   we can contribute 0 next time . 
  i 'm sure that 'll help reduce our deficit . 
  we can also close our borders to french produce thus kickstarting the industries that were smothered by it . 
  but that would lead us nowhere , would n't it ? 
   and already `` control '' the minority socialist government quite the stretch there , do n't you think ? 
  the minority government is supported by them and it has to appeal to them within reasonable limits , but the relationship with the eu was left mostly outside those limits . 
  are you a galician living in portugal ? 
  so volume would be even worse , since the average depth of the world 's seas is 3688 metres while the average depth of the mediterranean is 1500 metres . 
   the problem might be that the water might circumvent the dam and flood portugal and coastal africa . 
  how would that happen ? 
  there was terrible architecture in the 1800s as there was in any other era . 
  the terrible architecture from the 1800s likely just did n't make it to today . 
   i think in the last couple years the live transmissions of the oscars ( ! ), 
  in portugal tried to leave a lot more untranslated so people could hear the original ( if you are awake and watching at that time of the night chances are your english is good enough anyway ) . 
  there 's usually a live commented transmission where the commentators try to translate the gist of what is said , and a live transmission with the original sound . 
  then the following day there 's usually a subtitled transmission . 
  except for cinnamon , cinnamon is pretty common , even in traditional dishes , especially desserts . 
  in [ sangria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sangria ) for instance . 
  in lithuania no , but it would be recognised [ in malta or israel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:same-sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg ) for example .
