  it depends on the jurisdiction . 
  olivais is far from the city centre , but i agree with you that much of inner lisbon is inhabited by poorer people , although there many affluent areas as well . 
   but daylight saving time helps massively with coping with the shorter days in winter . 
  that 's not related to daylight saving per se , but to the time zone your country is in . 
  maybe your country 's winter time is closer to your natural time than you summer time . 
  did you honestly expect the eu to react any other way ? 
  do you even think the eu would gain anything by reacting any other way ? 
   how he treated the country that was not lisbon not that the lisboners had it any better if they were in the way of his ambitions . 
  all the urban development that happened in and around the city throughout the estado novo , and there was a lot of it , displaced and threw on the streets everyone who lived and owned those lands , and i 'm talking about poor farmers who got nothing or close to nothing in exchange for their plots of land , not powerful landowners . 
  because leaving the uk may be the only route for scotland to get back into the eu . 
  it 's anecdotal but from my experience many catholics , or people from that background , tend to be religious in more of a cultural sense not necessarily adhering to strict biblical mores than people who follow other faiths , except maybe the jews . 
  music taste might be subjective , quality not so much . 
  or you would be denying the validity of the whole academic field of aesthetics . 
  weird that they separated all the basins from the tagus tributaries that empty into it 's estuary from the tagus basin itself , like the sorraia or tranc\u00e3o . 
   the true believers in the eu are on some kind of deranged moral crusade . 
  or at least the `` true believers in the eu '' that caught your attention . 
  do n't generalise from anecdotal evidence . 
  have you seen his [ past\u00e9is de nata ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtbrxpxjhik ) ? 
  that 's an issue with centralised government as a concept and not european federalisation per se . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of places in sweden being affected by decisions taken by a majority of people who have never been there . 
  well , the flag eu uses is just the council of europe flag , and the uk is n't leaving the council . 
   4 . _ that we 're lazy sombrero wearing people , we actually are the country of the oecd with more hours worked in a year per person . 
  i do n't know about that , we and the greeks are up there as well and we are all lazy bums . 
  it does n't . 
  guterres/guti \u00e9rrez is of patronymic origin and as such it originated in many places at the same time both in portugal and in spain . 
  [ much like any other iberian name of patronymic origin . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patronymic#iberian_peninsula ), 
  well , the name of the site is literally `` hunter from the past '' . 
  it was really popular here in portugal when i was younger , a portuguese channel even created a shitty show inspired by it called inspector max . 
  well , you 're not supposed to eat it with the salt , are you ? 
  the * fo * in * foice * sounds exactly like * faux * , and that 's the stressed part , so it 's the part you 'll hear the most even though * oi * is a diphthong , because the i is quite subdued . 
  some dialects in portugal even [ drop the i completely ] ( https://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/fouce ) . 
  the only thing * faca * as in common in with * faux * is the f consonant , everything else sounds different . 
  yes , that 's exactly why * foice * is more similar to it than * faca * . 
  in portuguese * foice * means sickle and it sounds far more similar to * faux * ( especially in european portuguese ) than * faca * does . 
  and gibraltar . 
  everyone is still too hangover from winning the euro to be able to win anything else . 
  [ how could they ] ( http://amulherequemanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/577704_518054874919625_727477075_n-640x480.jpg ) [ resist our charm ?

  you have a very weird view of what the vatican is as a state , it 's barely more than a glorified campus . 
  it 's immigration policies are utterly irrelevant given it 's size and inability to have an autonomous and functioning economy , it depends on italy for pretty much everything . 
  being europeists ? 
  in / r/europe ? 
  i ca n't believe it !, 
   anyway our biggest emigrant community are from ukraine it 's actually brazil , by far . 
  probably followed by angola and cape verde . 
  green eyes are n't common at all in portugal . 
  hazel eyes are . 
  we 'll create a league of bullied iberian peoples . 
   i could have said iberians instead do n't drag us into that mess . 
  and [ if you ask him ] ( http://www.nhaterra.com.cv/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1330 ) he says he was born in portugal . 
  if only we had gotten zico to play for us . 
  give us griezmann and gameiro back and we 'll give you adrien , guerreiro and lopes . 
  might be worth noting that far more decisive than that was the lack of coal and iron . 
  colonialism has existed since antiquity . 
  are you sure not many people know it with the amount of m\u00fcesli brands that reference switzerland ? 
  does n't the uk have civil unions for heterosexual couples on top of marriages ? 
  i would expect the sets of rights conferred by both to be different . 
   garoto -- kinderkaffee what ? 
  and what the hell is a `` cafe sito '' ? 
  that version is a medley between aquarela do brasil and nega do cabelo duro , elis regina did another version of aquarela do brasil alone but with a completely different take on it , and it 's not even close to how good the aquarela do brasil half of the song in your link is . 
  at my driving school every car had double pedals . 
  kinda . 
  we have one from 1981 about wanting [ portugal in the eec ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjcxdfk-kum ) . 
  does that count ? 
  might be worth noting that the data for spain comes from a very small and self-reported sample . 
  pig : ronc ronc cricket : gri gri monkey : [ \u00e1 \u00e1 \u00e1 u u u ] ( https://youtu.be/47xoewlmrek?t=59 ), 
  [ it 's alright . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklp6qkmt2u ), 
  we are talking about portugal in an hypothetical iberian federation , as protected as any of those cultures and languages are * today * you have to compare their vitality to those of portugal 's . 
  edit : and since you mentioned elsewhere that you are a galician , i 'll leave you with a telling quote from some other discussion around here , `` portuguese is galician with a country , an army and an empire '' . 
  honestly i hope one day we are part of the same country , all of us in iberia , but part of a larger pan-european country not a pan-iberian one . 
  the idea of being part of a federation where a sizeable percentage of the population adheres to this point of view is the stuff of nightmares :  a right that likes to pretend that all spain is or at least should be homogeneous and with a centralised government, 
  the fact that other european countries have an even worse track record - and that 's something i agree with you - does n't make an iberian federation any more attractive for me as a portuguese citizen . 
  so , enough with that bullshit as well . 
  when i was younger there was a population of lynxes in the malcata range national preserve , the lynx is even the preserve 's symbol and it was created mostly for them , that 's why i was saying that . 
  maybe they had disappeared from there in the mean time , or maybe it was n't a wild population , because now i 'm finding news about lynxes being found in the wild in the malcata range for the first time . 
  the map did n't mention those areas were the areas with confirmed litters . 
  if that 's what 's represented there i take back what i said . 
  what 's your point ? 
  edit : spain is five times as large , and almost five times as populous as portugal , no wonder it 's more diverse . 
  the 2010 map ignores the lynx 's habitats in portugal . 
  yeah , fuck that . 
  historically spain has proved a terrible deal for their different cultural regions , no thank you . 
  that 's the second stanza which is n't officially part of the anthem , only the first stanza and the chorus are . 
  but i have to agree , that 's the most beautiful stanza of the whole song . 
  also , i 'll leave another translation here for you , it 's a pity you lose all the harmony of the poem in the translation , it 's far more beautiful in portuguese despite the still beautiful and strong imagery being effectively translated . 
   hoist the undefeated flag ,  in the lively light of your sky !, 
   may europe cry out to the whole earth :  portugal has not perished  kiss your merry ground  the ocean , roaring with love ,  and your victorious arm  gave new worlds to the world !, 
  i 've never really encountered instances of hispanophobia , the saying op mentioned is told mostly in jest . 
  i had a nz teacher at uni . 
  he was pretty good , and the only new zealander i 've ever met . 
   for italian , san marino is obvious why ? 
  we also gloss over the times we invaded them . 
  [ more happy fado .

  hold my pastel de nata , i 'm going in !, 
  as soon as op shares the link . 
  you 're also leaving the council of europe ? 
  that sounds just like uni\u00e3o ib\u00e9rica in disguise .
