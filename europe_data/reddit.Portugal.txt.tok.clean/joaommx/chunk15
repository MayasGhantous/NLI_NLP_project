  we 're on to you !, 
  pdl = ponta delgada , on s\u00e3o miguel island the largest city in the azores . 
  i would love to know if the jewish population really decreased in portugal or if that is just the result of a poor estimation of the 1933 numbers . 
  after using them we dry them in the clothesline alongside the drying clean clothes . 
   actually , no . 
  i guess it depends on the family but one is enough . 
  if you keep everything clean , towels do n't get dirty , they are usually changed after a week more or less . 
  it depends on how much you use them ahah with my family each of us has it 's own ass towel , just like the bath towels . 
  chickpeas are optional as well , just like beans . 
  se europe ? 
  what does that mean , south eastern ? 
  right , it was used in between g or q and e or i when the u is n't silent . 
  edit : apparently before 1945 it was also used to denote the absence of the \u00b4 on a u in words that derive from others , like sa\u00fade  sa\u00fcdade . 
  much like the ` was used for other vowels ( e.g. 
  does n't \u00e7 exist in english as well ? 
  used for example in fa\u00e7ade ? 
  the \u00fc was removed from brazilian portuguese recently through the ao 1990 , in portugal it had unfortunately already been removed in 1945 . 
   amadora is a different ~ ~ county ~ ~ municipality than porto or lisbon there are no counties in portugal , nor anything comparable . 
  we had hail today down here in lisbon . 
  because the deepest part of the river is under there . 
  the view from the 25 de abril bridge has nothing on vasco da gama 's view at sunrise . 
  probably one of the best views of lisbon you can get , with that pinkish , orangey light bathing the city from the east . 
  * your teacher * taught you that , i never heard anything of that sort when i was in school . 
  made in the oven ? 
  with separate layers of meat and rice ? 
  might have been [ empad\u00e3o de arroz ] ( http://www.vaqueiro.pt/image/recipetofacebook/1388 ), 
  we do it as well . 
  the op is portuguese though , he 's very familiar with them . 
  exactly , the name literally translates to * saint martin of the port * . 
  [ jagten ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/ ) is a fantastic danish movie from 2012 . 
  they are n't wrong though . 
  going by what movies taught me it has been around at least since the stone age and it 's spoken pretty much everywhere . 
  he has indian ancestry , hence his permanent tan . 
  toasty in what sense ? 
  because many settlers to the azores were french ( along with the flemish ) and you can still tell the french pronunciation influence on the azorian accents , they say some sounds in a vaguely french way . 
  i bet the basques , asturians and cantabrians are all very confused about why you do n't think they are northerners . 
   portugal 's pm [ it 's this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_costa ), 
  i actually think that in the before picture the building looks much more tasteful and interesting , albeit not very well maintained . 
  the crappy paint job disguised the composition of volumes and makes it look pretty monolithic . 
  yes , i 'm sure it does n't make much of a difference at that latitude i was just pointing out that the canaries are indeed in the gmt-1 longitudes , not in between gmt and gmt-1 . 
  grevenmacher and diekirch . 
  not probably , and far from the frontier between gmt and gmt-1 , [ iceland , the canaries and madeira are all smack in the middle of gmt-1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/timezones2008_utc-1.png ) , even coastal portugal and galicia are already in gmt-1 . 
   just like ~ ~ all western ~ ~ most of france . 
  this really puts in perspective how far the irish society has come in terms of tolerance for homosexuals . 
  in the 90s baby jesus delivered the presents to my family , and we were n't even particularly religious , only one of my grandmas was a practising catholic , and she did n't even go to church on a weekly basis , other than her we only had `` cultural catholics '' among us at most . 
   the more catalans keep behaving irrationally and honestly ... childish . 
  the less support they 'll get abroad for their independence . 
  have they been behaving irrationally and childishly ? 
  and i mean catalonian independentists in general , not particular cases such as this one . 
  pretty sure he was n't since he was responding to someone who was talking about the number of breweries . 
  switzerland has 483 breweries and 8,401,120 inhabitants , which means it has 5.749 breweries per 100,000 people . 
  czechia has 338 breweries and 10,553,443 inhabitants , which means it has 3.202 breweries per 100,000 people . 
  so , yes , i do math . 
  switzerland is ahead of them . 
  might be others too . 
  how do you know they do n't realise that ? 
  [ galandum galundaina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pe0s9ayijk ) should be right up your alley then . 
  they sing in mirandese , an extant leonese language . 
   and then instructions handed down to the parliamentary majorities ( 70 % ) on what to vote for looking at the track record of the s&d and epp mps it does n't look that compatible as you seem to imply . 
  even among mps of the same group . 
  it 's jews all the way down !, 
   the situation in portugal is especially worrying , as it is the only non-english-speaking eu country where less than 1 foreign language per pupil is studied at this level . 
  should n't one already have quite a good grasp of english before starting the upper secondary education ? 
  his conclusion seems quite the stretch . 
  it 's october 5th , the same day the monarchy was replaced by a republic several centuries afterwards . 
  it 's a holiday in portugal although we celebrate mostly ( or exclusively ? ), 
  the proclamation of the portuguese republic . 
  well , looks like it 's solved then . 
  congratulations / r/europe !, 
  we did well today . 
  in that photo it looks like he 's together with felipe and ferro rodrigues has two wives . 
  i 'm sorry if i came off as a smartass , i did n't mean it . 
  meh , at least we are top-10 in something . 
  are personal freedoms still that limited that side of the border ? 
  you 're behind the uk and they ca n't even watch porn . 
  what 's your point ? 
  is n't that the same as [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5fbbvr/christmas_tree_in_lisbon/dajqur7/ ) ? 
   2nd reign of marie ii ( 1834-1853 ) either * maria * in portuguese , or * mary * since you 're writing in english , no ? 
  euronews was a bit like that . 
  in editorial terms it still is , although it 's not under the ebu umbrella anymore . 
  as is [ blood stew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabidela ) . 
  epp are federalists but alde are only pro-eu ? 
  he can be both . 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way , and while i agree with you that you should n't just be downvoted or insulted instead of being engaged in conversation , the truth is that you are claiming all of this unlikely things without supporting any evidence . 
  i mean , should we just take your word for it that there are many vets that say that it 's not good for dogs such as the rafeiro alentejano to sleep outside in the region they were bred in ? 
  [ far less impressive . 
  ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/@38.6848684,-9.1759357,3a,75y,125.34h,87.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxenea_ncrlhgxivtbupjea!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  to be fair , [ so do the italians ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/pizza_fritta_ ( gastronomia \\ ) ) . 
  yes , i know it 's you opinion but i meant that as far as i 'm aware your are not basing your opinion on authoritative sources hence why i said '' * just * your opinion '' . 
   dogs are not made to live always outside i think that is just your opinion . 
  surely some breeds could n't survive in the extremaduran winter , but i do n't think that is the case of a local breed like this . 
  i mean , if he lived in nature he would be living outdoors all the same , and this breed originated in this region , this is their natural habitat . 
  maybe they are right in some of their appreciations in this thread , i would only know it by researching each case . 
  i 'm not sure if they are all ( or any of them in fact ) the responsibility of modernism or a modernist architect in particular , even though some like le corbusier might have developed plans that called for the destruction of built heritage . 
  his plan for the bulldozing of central paris was never taken seriously after all , but aspects of the new paris he planned in it 's place were praised and have influenced urbanism for good in some ways . 
  le corbusier and modernism have been criticised in academia since the beginning , what i do n't agree with is writing off both of them while ignoring the innovations that both brought to architecture and urbanism , as if the flaws of both is what defines them . 
  there is a reason both are studied to this day in architecture schools , and both their innovations and their limits or flaws are studied . 
  fellow architect here feeling the pain reading this sub . 
  yes , le corbusier had some terrible ideas , yes , modernism is far from perfect , hence why both are part of the history of architecture and not trend setters of today . 
  but seeing people take loos out of context or ignore the good that corbusier or van der rohe brought to the field generalising from their bad ideas , and ask for a return to outdated architectural styles and construction technologies makes my soul ache .
