  they should n't freak out . 
  if you 've never eaten a nice plate of [ carac\u00f3is with an imperial on the side ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7rb8fegyawa/s_wgprxxcyi/aaaaaaaaacu/5qv1zy3-y2m/s400/caracois_001.jpg ) on a hot summer day you do n't know what you 're missing . 
  and they play mexicans because of their accent when speaking english , i guess they fit the white mexican mold easier than they do the spaniard . 
  i would n't expect such a low turn-out , even if it 's non-binding . 
  cape verde, 
  what defines a celtic nation really ? 
  i guess the language ? 
  because most of western europe and parts of central europe were at a time occupied by celts . 
  ah , did n't understand it that way . 
  thanks mate !, 
   then there 's am\u00e1lia , which pretty much created her own genre : fado . 
  what ? 
  fado predates am\u00e1lia in at least one century . 
  what are those divisions in portugal ? 
  those are n't municipalities , districts , nor nuts regions . 
  the more knowledge and means you have the easier you amass more knowledge and means . 
  you had him at greek and you lost him at turkish . 
  no way man , it 's hands down east timor !, 
  [ xanana gusm\u00e3o in portugal in 1999 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=n6vxbk2j0ie#t=109 ) [ watch til the end ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pvr5bwvciq ), 
  we can and do . 
  animated movies dubbed in brazil were the norm until the mid nineties , we also got a few dubbed tv series from there like the a-team or knight rider . 
  brazilian soap operas also have a long and successful history in portugal . 
  well , similarity is not the only factor . 
  we are talking about the opposite , non-english speakers learning english . 
  all four of them are in the same language family , just not in the same branch . 
  but semantics aside , that is true . 
  let the estado novo ( pre-1974 ) raised generation die off before you come to any conclusions . 
  in those times few learned english and watched english movies or tv shows . 
  german and english are much more similar being both germanic languages , which portuguese and greek are not . 
  motherfuckers ... 
  it 's like they want us to side with spain on this one . 
  i would say galicia if it was n't for the weather , in spain it 's catalunya , arag\u00f3n and madrid for me . 
  also lazio in italy and probably also tuscany from what i know of it and it 's people . 
  i also felt surprisingly at home in istanbul and the aegean coast of turkey , more than in athens . 
  istanbul is the foreign city most similar to lisbon i 've ever been to , you should come here and see for yourself . 
  obviously . 
  while at berlin , i would say that the pergamonmuseum - for it 's collections - and the neues museum and neue nationalgalerie - for the museum itself , are obligatory . 
  i would also suggest a walk in the tiergarten and the hansaviertel area , a visit to the holocaust memorial ( arrive from the east , visiting the underground vaults first and the memorial itself afterwards ) and a visit to the reichstag 's dome . 
  i was trying to remember where a greek eatery i ate the most delicious yogurt was , but i ca n't seem to find it anywhere . 
  i know it was right beside a viaduct of the s-bahn high line located immediately north of the centre , ca n't remember any more though . 
   how would it be fair to deprive scotland one but give much smaller countries that opportunity instead ? 
  he did n't write that scotland should be deprived of their commissioner , that would be idiotic , as is the idea of depriving smaller members of their comissioners . 
  the way to go should be appoiting comissioners regardless of their nationality . 
  appoint the number of comissioners needed and choose the best possible person for the job . 
  i 'm all for an `` ever closer union '' , but a union of equal - or as equal as possible - regions . 
  not a matryoshka of regions/nations like we have today , especially in the uk . 
  about portugal 's export figures , the largest export sector is either [ oil or machinery ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/portugal_export_treemap.png ) depending on how you look at it . 
  the same goe to [ greece ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/greece_export_treemap.jpg ) and [ romania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/romania_export_treemap.png ) by the way , the other singled out `` poorer countries '' who `` lack sophisticated manufacturing sectors '' .

  [ here you go .

  there is only so much tourism and business these historic buildings can bring . 
  around here every town has quite a few century old sites/buildings and some millennium/millennia old ones , unfortunately you wo n't ever get enough tourists to fuel all the necessary restoration projects they need , hence why alternative uses for them are being sought-after more and more . 
  source : i 'm a soon to be architect in lisbon , who has often studied local restoration projects and who was teached by the ceo of a monument management public company and i also know several professionals who work in it . 
  does the population of roussillon even want to be part of catalunya ? 
  contrary to popular belief this is also the best time to eat sardines , it 's when they 're fatter . 
  they 're much better now than those skinny tasteless things people eat in droves during the festas populares ( in june ) . 
  also plums and we 're still on the melons , watermelons and peaches . 
  it 's still summer here . 
  as a southern european , the only men i 've ever kissed for hello are my father and my grandfathers . 
  drove a diesel seat ibiza for my driving lessons , it drives great . 
  in fact if i had to buy a car for me right now i would probably get one of those . 
  i 'm not sure that 's the issue . 
  portugal has what many would call a socialist constitution since the 1970 's and yet we 're a nato founding member and we 've had a us air force [ base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lajes_field ) in the azores since 1952 . 
  same in portugal . 
  it 's not too uncommon . 
  dating between whites and blacks is a bit restricted to lisbon and it 's suburbs but we have a long , long history of interracial/interethnic dating especially between whites and asians , namely indians and chinese . 
  i know quite a few persons of mixed white and asian background whose families came from goa and macau . 
  there 's also some mingling between portuguese and brazilians , and as you may know there are many brazilians of mixed european / african / amerindian descent . 
  i actually was going to say that i had never dated a person of a different race/ethnicity but that 's not 100 % true . 
  i did hook up with a brazilian girl who had clearly some amerindian heritage . 
  i did n't even ever think about it before writing this comment . 
  i expect only a handful of redditors to be able to do it . 
  i , for example , certainly could n't write countries and capitals names in their native languages for every country in europe . 
  especially the caucasus and cyrillic script nations . 
  and hungary obviously !, 
  is it magiorzsag ? 
  141/141 great quiz . 
   basque country ftfy, 
  i can place every country in europe , but i 'm not going through all that trouble to do it . 
  i expect the majority of redditors here in / r/europe to be able to do it too . 
  i 've never seen it come up when stereotypes are discussed here either . 
  it 's not just about my perception . 
  it is ? 
  i 've never heard of it . 
  no , it is n't celebrated as such . 
  more than half of the population still identify as catholic though . 
  but i do n't know how relevant that might be considering that the majority of countries with gay-friendly policies have catholic cristianism as their most popular denomination/religion . 
  from my experience dealing with other europeans , especially spaniards , portuguese use less drugs but drink more . 
  to know if discriminalizing drugs has worked you would need to compare this values to the ones predating that legislation . 
  m\u00e1rio soares put it forward after he left his position as president , the portuguese government has never pushed for it , at least publicly . 
  yes , their official language is portuguese , but because you used caps on portuguese i thought you meant there was some very close relationship between the two countries , like say , switzerland and liechtenstein or the us and some micronesian nations . 
  why should it when we have european union lands in the caribbean , south america , and the indian ocean ? 
  there are four times more european citizens living in these areas than there are inhabitants in cabo verde . 
  i 'm not portugal , i 'm a portuguese citizen and i 'm sure you would find many portuguese who would n't support an eventual cabo verdean accension . 
  and how is cabo verde a portuguese country ? 
  i 'm not op , but i 'm completely for an eventual accension of cabo verde . 
  there are already more cabo verdeans living inside the eu - many of whom are eu citizens - than there are in cabo verde itself . 
  cabo verde is the only macaronesian archipelago currently not in the eu . 
  their culture is a mixture of europe 's and africa 's comparable to some caribbean nations or territories many of which are part of the eu .
