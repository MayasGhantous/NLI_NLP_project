  politically they are one of , if not the most developed african nation . 
  economically they are worse off than all eu candidates but better than some potential candidates like bih . 
  bear in mind though that they are a very small nation with little resources to draw from , hence their economy being mostly service based . 
  they also have a huge potential when it comes to tourism . 
  and what have they got to offer the eu ? 
  acess to [ a quite large eez ] ( http://www.seaaroundus.org/eez/132.aspx ) that can be greatly extended . 
  a strategically relevant position on atlantic air and sea lanes , midway between europe and south america , the potential for the creation of an airway and seaway hub . 
  and the potential to work as a connection to the western african economies , offering european services and products to a large developable area of the world . 
  plus , look at their [ flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/flag_of_cape_verde.svg ) . 
  it 's meant to be . 
  even coriander ? 
  might get a little too intense with coriander . 
  coriander is intense . 
  what about designing the new towers so that they fit their surroundings better ? 
   yes , you can say one of the most famous portuguese dishes is bacalhau you can ? 
  since when is bacalhau a dish ? 
  it 's an ingredient in many , many dishes , no one eats just bacalhau , you eat it as bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s , bacalhau com todos , bacalhau com natas , bacalhau espiritual , et cetera . 
  if there is one dish that is thought of as the `` national dish '' that is [ cozido \u00e0 portuguesa ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/e8/95/8b/o-monchiqueiro.jpg ) . 
  is there any reuters link to the recording ? 
  i 'm not saying that portuguese people did n't feel superior , mind you . 
  what i 'm saying is that it was n't a significant theme in political or social discourse to the point that women would do something absurd like that . 
  do you have a source on that part of the moustaches ? 
  because i do n't remember ever seeing women with moustaches in old photos . 
  also that `` pure race '' talk does n't sound anything like us ... 
  in general portuguese people are n't aware of that stereotype . 
  btw , i do n't really get what 's so special about our towels , but then again i 've never used foreign towels . 
  throughout history humans have been enlarging their `` tribes '' , it 's an apparently ongoing process . 
  so , even without looking into what the driving forces behind it are , it 's at least not unreasonable to expect the creation of other unions of the kind elsewhere . 
  there are already several projects similar to the eu in some respects althouth none as extensive , like the african union , caricom or east african community .

  russian well , i 'm impressed . 
  i would make a case for [ d. jo\u00e3o ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_ii_of_portugal ) being a more influential monarch , but i do n't have that much free time right now , maybe i 'll write about it later . 
  i do n't really know , i was going by their website . 
  the only station of those i usually go to is areeiro and it 's progressing there , albeit very slowly . 
  `` just '' has in we have been continually upgrading it for the last 60 years . 
  a little bit each time . 
  currently we 're extending the blue line one more station [ from the terminal amadora este to reboleira ] ( http://www.metrolisboa.pt/obras/obras-em-curso/empreendimento-reboleira/ ) . 
  we are also [ extending the platforms of the arroios and areeiro stations ] ( http://www.metrolisboa.pt/obras/obras-em-curso/ ) so that the green line can have six car trains , and renovating the aged anjos and intendente stations in the same line . 
   if you find someone with 25 + years they probably dont speak english no man , definitely no . 
  think more like 45 + . 
  spaniards ca n't do portuguese accent , it sounds spanish the same . 
  even if they 're actually speaking portuguese . 
  that might be offshoring resulting from the centralisation of services in the largest metropolis . 
  the constitution would have to be changed requiring at least 2/3 approval in the parliament . 
  it 's highly unlikely because there 's only one monarchist party and they only got 0,27 % of the vote in the last parliamentary elections . 
  to make matters worse , the best known pretender to the throne duarte pio the `` duke of braganza '' does n't support this party . 
  well , money is the measure of power and serfdom is a type of power relationship . 
  agreed . 
  portugal , spain and france are usually near the top for alcohol consumption rankings around the world . 
  now they are , they were n't by the time this was posted , so much so that the final mandates did n't match what the guardian originally had there . 
  take the mpt for example , the guardian had them with only one mandate when it was first posted . 
  the portuguese mandates are certainly wrong . 
  and as far as i know the final results have n't been released yet . 
  he 's apparently saying that upyd dislikes catalans , not that catalans dislike podemos . 
   some 20 % increase in population at least only if you 're considering just the population of lisbon 's municipality . 
  because if you compare it to the greater lisbon area the increase was far more modest , some 3 % . 
  i agree with you , what i found funny is the implication that it 's any different in the uk . 
   that guy is one of the least corrupt people we have . 
  do you have a source fot that ? 
  i 'm not denying he is n't though , i 'm just curious to know where you and op are coming from . 
   populism is a favourite eurocrat word , meaning ` when politicians do what their constituents want ' -- or , as we call it in english , ` democracy ' . 
  that implication is just too funny . 
  if portugal did n't vote as a whole for the european elections you can bet alentejo would also appear as european united left land . 
  so portugal is the oldest participant that has n't won yet ? 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  we already ate them before ~ ~ being ~ ~ realising we were poor . 
   soccer coaches [ then ] ( http://www.antf.pt/data/uploads/palmares-treinadores/treinadores-com-mais-titulos/jorge.jpg ) [ now :( ] ( http://www.jornalacores9.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/artur-jorge.jpg ), 
  i hear they make good eatin . 
  i was going to write something about it , but then ... meh . 
  some months ago i went to museu gr\u00e3o vasco in viseu with a group of foreigners . 
  there were several paintings there of a local noblewoman of centuries gone with a majestic moustache , more majestic than i can grow . 
  needless to say , that undid all my efforts to dispell that stereotype . 
  the order of christ cross is n't really comparable to any of the other symbols though , is it ? 
  it 's also the roundel of the portuguese air force . 
  obviously if it was a fascist symbol it would n't be used that way . 
  it 's as much a symbol of estado novo as the portuguese flag is . 
  so fitting that you can vote for a pirate party if you are in the antilles . 
  considering the amount of wars and their death toll we have had in such a small area i would n't tell . 
  since when is it failing ? 
  i 've heard that bayern is a very conservative state , i 've even heard it being called the `` german texas '' . 
  but how popular are op 's views there ? 
   every group of people have a right to create their own nation and govern by what they seem fit to their causes and their people . 
  because that has worked really well for all of us in the last dozen centuries . 
  similar to portugal i guess . 
  most pro-russians i 've spoken to since this crisis began were communists who support russia because they believe they 'll stand up against american imperialism . 
  we 'll call britain to save us . 
  you 'll never take us again !, 
  hey !, 
  you leave us out of this . 
  out of curiosity , where do you live ? 
  might have to do with it , most old people i know live in lisbon/alentejo . 
  i guess i 'll be moving to a visegr\u00e1d group country then . 
  i would argue that a footballer like stoichkov , bojinov or berbatov is probably better known . 
  really ?!, 
  i know many .
