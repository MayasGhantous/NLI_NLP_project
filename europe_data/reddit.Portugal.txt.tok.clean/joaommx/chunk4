  have in mind that a 60 to 75 year old is or was working until recently and the internet has been around for quite some time , in most jobs you have had to use email regularly for the last 10 to 15 years . 
  still , that 's no reason to enforce a curfew . 
  many old people under 70/75 tend to use the internet quite often , at least going by the ones i know . 
  did n't you know that portuguese sound like russians ? 
  [ ;-) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4qzpbcfia ), 
  the political campaign has n't started yet , so the media has been ignoring the elections so far . 
  bog , sounds more interesting and wet enough . 
  so irish jon snow would be sean bog . 
  well , other than that . 
  what 's sad is the likely large amount of ignorance fueled votes their going to get . 
  at least going by these posters . 
  those jewfros are glorious !, 
   the second was a friend 's belgian aunt and she just said i `` did n't dress like a north american . '', 
  i 'll just go ahead and guess that you do n't wear white tube socks with sandals . 
  we really have a knack for giving things naughty names considering spanish speakers are right next door . 
  kind of like telecom service meo . 
  did you choose your own country in the beginning or did you just go ahead and answer the uk survey ? 
  i 'm a little surprised that five of the six parties i 'm closer to are green parties . 
  namely the french , austrian , flemish , italian and german . 
  21 % match to ukip was the lowest score . 
   \u2022 i wish we invested a lot more in cycling ways around the city , like some northern nations do , to the extent where it becomes a central way of moving around and not just an eccentricity . 
  it will always be an `` eccentricity '' in lisbon despite the recent investement in cycling lanes . 
  lisbon 's topography is just not good for cycling . 
  i 'll answer with the whole meal !, 
  [ stracciatella alla romana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stracciatella#soup ) , [ carbonara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonara ) and some [ zabajone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zabaione ) to finish . 
  there 's a theme going on there too !, 
  most hiv infection cases in portugal probably come from drug addicts sharing needles . 
  at least that was one of the main reasons for the changes in drug policy that led to it 's decriminalization . 
  you should n't translate brand names like comboios de portugal . 
  we do n't translate volkswagen to `` carro do povo '' or american express to `` expresso americano '' either do we ? 
  great job though . 
  not only is cape verde the only macaronesian territory outside the eu , but over 200.000 cape verdeans already live in europe . 
  for perspective , cape verde has a population of only 531.000 . 
  like an independent force ? 
  the traffic police is a division of the gendarmerie . 
   they cover fields like guarding public buildings , overseeing protests and other major events , riot control , swat teams , and pretty much everything `` special '' that there is to do in law enforcement . 
  here in portugal the regular police is in charge of all that . 
  our gendarmes are a kind of rural police force and highway patrol . 
  honestly , i ca n't really tell if it would be more efficient to have the regular police ( psp ) takeover the gendarmes ' role ( gnr ) . 
  as a regular citizen they look similar in the way they act . 
  that 's a very strong portuguese accent there . 
  and according to himself he played in portugal with cristiano ronaldo , but the only player i can think of who went from sporting to arsenal is [ lu\u00eds boa morte ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu%c3%ads_boa_morte ) and that 's not him . 
  you do n't want that . 
  has an almoravid , i would have to invade you . 
  i 'll give you that , i had n't known the scale of the trade and it 's effects in the region , i only knew that the african kingdoms were in the trade . 
   bes ( banco espirito santo , holy ghost bank ) esp\u00edrito santo , although meaning holy ghost , is a family name , it should n't be translated . 
  it would be like translating goldman sachs to homem-de-ouro sax\u00e3o . 
  edit : and btw , thanks for this summaries you 've been writing , they 're great !, 
  i would argue it was from the `` scramble for africa '' phase onwards and not from the 16th century . 
  until then the african powers were also in on the slaves , gold , ivory , spices trade . 
  i was born after my country joined the eu so i 'm probably not the best suited person to answer this . 
  but still , things like the schengen agreement and the euro have been the eu decisions that have most obviously affected my life . 
  we do n't dislike spaniards , we just hate being thought of as such . 
  what does that have got to do with anything ? 
  one thing i can assure you is there 's no way the eu is going to become more popular in portugal by invanding russia , quite the opposite . 
   and very catholic . 
  really ? 
  i always thought he would be a bordeline nonbeliever , having started his political career in a maoist party . 
  oh , yeah , that 's going to make the eu really popular over here . 
  and bring back [ jeux sans fronti\u00e8res ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57pg8hjdtdy ) !, 
  as a portuguese , i have to say that i found stockholm more exotic than istanbul . 
  the latter was much like other southern european cities , only full of mosques and turkish flags . 
  boy , you really like your flag . 
  just how it should be , not mandatory but a great idea in those scorching summer days . 
  that 's a good approximation , yes . 
  something along those lines also happens here in portugal . 
  when northerners want to make fun of southerners sometimes they 'll call them moroccan . 
  the explanation is that the southern regions of portugal were under andalusian rule for much longer than the northern ones . 
  or any less . 
  being an actor does n't mean he 's neither right nor wrong . 
   your boy like op has anything to do with that ... 
  switzerland and norway are out of the eu for very specific reasons unrelated to any i could think of for scotland . 
  what would scotland gain by moving out of the union ? 
  as a sidenote , i would n't describe the peninsular war campaigns in portugal as an invasion . 
  they saved us from france . 
  i did n't know that . 
  how do you call euskadi in spanish then ? 
  euskadi edit : why the downvotes ? 
  he said it himself he wanted to pick up some basque while there , he might as well start with the basque name for the place !, 
  but our transgender legislation is quite good though . 
  it depends a lot on how you look at it . 
  in terms of progressive legislation in general we have been recovering fast , but i guess that was to be expected , historically , and with the exception of the estado novo regime , we 've always been quite open to new ideas . 
  but for some reason euthanasia seems to usually be forgotten . 
  i ca n't speak for spain , but i can speak for portugal , until the crisis hit our government was being pressured by the eu to build high speed rail lines . 
  we do n't even have it for mature citizens in suffering here !, 
  make us proud , dear snow covered friends !, 
  you 're never going to be taken seriously as long as you keep riding on that germanophobia . 
  that 's a very swedish way of looking at it . 
  i would argue that they do n't have a summer , that it 's just spring until autumn . 
  i thought most british spend the winter here , not the summer . 
  but that same principle applies to any other criteria for nationality , not just this one . 
  fyi portugal also has a [ law of return ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_nationality_law#jewish_law_of_return ) for sephardim of portuguese descent . 
  do you know any muladi ? 
  as long as you can prove it . 
  reminds me of the [ carnation revolution ] ( http://codigodacultura.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/maia-jpg.jpeg ) . 
  agree with the idea that location should n't be the criteria . 
  that being said , we are very far from reaching a point when morocco and algeria will share enough of `` european ideals '' to join the eu . 
  the african nation closest to the eu both in terms of culture and politics is cape verde , and as of this moment they are only comparable to a potential candidate like albania or bih . 
  i would include turkey , the caucasus and russia in my definition of europe . 
  that being said , it does n't mean i would agree with the ascension of all of these countries , at least in the forseable future .
