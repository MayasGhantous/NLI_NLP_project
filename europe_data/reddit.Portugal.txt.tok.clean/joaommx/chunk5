  i would n't mind if the eu went beyond the limits if a given country was culturally or politically close enough , though . 
  can someone translate this one ? 
  thing is , it has some mistakes , but in general it paints a very clear picture of the peninsula 's history . 
  the parliament passed a government led initiative to call for a referendum on both co-adoption and adoption by same sex couples . 
  the left wing parties acused the government of creating a diversion with this to distract the population from the much more serious financial and economical problems . 
  the right wing party in the government coalition abstained from voting . 
  and several mps of the party that led the initiative declared that they would n't have voted for it if the voting discipline had n't been enforced . 
  to any german out there , what 's your opinion on schulz , both as a politician and as a possible ec president ? 
  surprised me too . 
  as opposed to a strongly regulated market . 
  baby steps . 
  first the rest of the planets , then the stars . 
  yes , man !, 
  have an upvote .

  are you implying that a majority of spaniards found out about a gay relative and so the law passed ? 
  or that just came out of nowhere ? 
  that 's because we used xii century royal seals in our coins . 
  but i think they could be a lot better if we dropped all the little castles and escutcheons around the seals . 
  they make the design too `` noisy '' . 
  portugal is spain 's relative , they pick on each other a lot but deep down they know they can count on one another , they 're family after all . 
  they kind of look alike , both are tanned , good looking , with dark brown wavy air . 
  portugal is a bit smaller though . 
  he used to be a great student , but in the last few years had some problems at home and he 's now failing miserably in spite of actually doing an effort . 
  he has always this melancholic look now , and has become a little too much self-deprecating . 
  the uk is one of his oldest friends , they 've known each other since kindergarten and used to hang a lot . 
  once the uk defended portugal from france who was bullying him . 
  france had told portugal not to play with the uk but portugal did n't listen because they were good friends . 
  but that was many years ago , portugal does n't hold a grudge against france , actually he 's always trying to hang with him , and with germany , switzerland , the us , canada even poor little luxembourg who 's completely overwhelmed by him . 
  they do n't care much for portugal , but do n't mind him either . 
  during summer break germany even pays portugal a visit sometimes . 
  in a good way , mind you ! ^ you ^ never ^ know ^ with ^ germany , ^ right ? 
  germany is not the only one who likes to come by though , portugal 's mate the uk comes over a lot too and always drags poor little ireland with him . 
  portugal 's spends most of his time playing football but no one ca n't stand him playing . 
  he 's that little shit who 's always trying to dribble his way to the goal , never passes to no one and if you touch him he 'll just dive and whine . 
  it 's a pity though , if it was n't for his absurd ways on the pitch he might actually be a good and popular player . 
  he likes to fish too , he 's good at it , sometimes he gets in his little boat and just goes off to the sea trying to catch something , or maybe it 's just to be alone for a while , i do n't know . 
  a little known fact by the way , portugal also likes to write , poems mostly , he 's decent at it too . 
  bet you did n't know that !, 
  he does n't talk much about it . 
  portugal has many cousins around the world . 
  big and joyful brazil is his best known , but there 's also nouveau riche angola , unlucky mo\u00e7ambique , guinea-bissau , who 's always getting in some kind of trouble , little cape verde , who seems to know everyone . 
  and his favorite and youngest cousin , little east timor . 
  it 's a pity he lives so far , he 's a good kid , a little wild but a good kid . 
  my favorites are the italian $ 1 coin , greek , slovak and maltese $ 1 and $ 2 coins and all the finnish coins . 
  it 's wrong . 
  at least [ aniki b\u00f3b\u00f3 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034461/ ) is ranked higher, 
  eus\u00e9bio 's funeral was on tv all day long ... 
  thanks for the insightful response , mate . 
  i think portuguese in general are all for european integration as long as europe does n't try to screw us over . 
  even the most eurosceptic parties here , the far left ones , usually only attack the eu for being a capitalistic demon , not for the idea of the union in itself . 
  being a small nation stuck between the ocean and spain must have made us look for opportunities elsewhere , and that led to a centuries ' old experience of meeting , trading ( and fighting ) with foreigners . 
  that probably gave us a very unique perception of our country 's place in europe and the world . 
  or at least i think so . 
  yes , not exactly the main reason but it must have contributed . 
  i remember reading moore 's utopia and being surprised by how important he felt that utopia should be an island nation surrounded by unclimbable cliffs . 
  in the case of the uk it might be for the same thing it is for germany or france , no ? 
  you can use a huge free market to sell at . 
  do you think british ( english in particular ) generally feel that way about the eu because of your geographical situation ? 
  i want more european integration , i want it to a point that it would be indistinguishable from a federation . 
  but unlike what you 're assuming , i do n't want anything with european nationalism , or portuguese nationalism for that matter . 
  i want solely to be a citizen of a larger world . 
  edit : and i suspect most european federalists are in the same boat . 
  their recovery was much faster , there 's no doubt about that , but they also lost a great deal more spending power than we did . 
  and i 'm not even trying to argue that we 're doing fine , we 're doing very bad , but it 's not like iceland got a much better deal . 
  and i actually meant weaker economies , it was a poor choice of words . 
  i 'm not so sure iceland 's experience with the financial crisis was better than portugal 's . 
  and you are assuming the eu will remain inflexible , and wo n't workout better ways to protect it 's smaller economies . 
   \u2022 ** norway ** is all about the oil . 
  they 'll stay out of europe while they have it so as to reap the benefits in full , and join when the oil and the money from that oil runs out . 
  it may take an economic downturn at the right time to achieve this , however , norwegians are very economically comfortable at the moment and have no desire to change the status quo until change is forced on them . 
  even after the oil runs out they 'll still have their fisheries management blocking ascension to the eu . 
  i think portuguese in general are more conservative than average in the way we live our own lifes . 
  but we also tend to let others live their own how they want , hence the progressive legislation . 
  i 'm voting for the s&d not for them . 
  as i , as a lisboner , voted for mayor ant\u00f3nio costa and not for ps . 
  i wish i had that option . 
  i 'm also not that happy to vote for our own socialists and besides that , upyd is one of only three parties with whom i had 100 % correspondence . 
  s&d , as i expected . 
  93 % match , unsurprisingly we only disagree on nuclear energy . 
  not a fan of the most recent acts of the portuguese socialist party but i 'm going to vote for them the same . 
   ** winter ** trip, 
  the czech republic on the other hand is the least religious country in europe and not really that progressive in terms of homossexuality according to that link . 
  considering that two of the most religious countries in europe are also among the most progressive i do n't really see a problem there . 
  hell no !, 
  in portuguese it 's the same . 
  it is dominant . 
  fnac is a french company . 
  [ continente ] ( http://www.continente.pt/pt-pt/public/pages/homepage.aspx ) has it before almost everywhere in their website except that promotion . 
  [ minipre\u00e7o ] ( http://www.minipreco.pt/ ) uses it before . 
  i ca n't find how pingo doce uses it . 
  [ edp ] ( http://www.edp.pt/pt/pages/homepage.aspx ) , [ galp ] ( http://www.galpenergia.com/pt/paginas/home.aspx , [ tmn ] ( http://www.tmn.pt/portal/site/tmn ) , [ meo ] ( http://meo.pt/ ) , [ optimus ] ( http://www.optimus.pt/particulares/ ) , [ zon ] ( http://www.zon.pt/pages/home.aspx ) , [ worten ] ( http://www.worten.pt/store/ ) all used it before too . 
  from what i can tell using the $ symbol after is almost as uncommon as using eur . 
  printed press is were you 'll find the most brands using it that way like p\u00fablico , record , di\u00e1rio de not\u00edcias , sol or jornal de not\u00edcias . 
  they 're still in the minority though . 
  portugal 2 . 
  before 3 . 
  after 4 . 
  before !, 
  almost exclusively , look it up .
