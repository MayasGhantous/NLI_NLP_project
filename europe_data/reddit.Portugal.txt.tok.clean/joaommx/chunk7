  that 's because poland is in central europe . 
  future interests are n't debt yet . 
  i am portuguese and i hope not . 
  why are we stating our nationalities ? 
  with bread . 
  ah yes , they have been fiercely fighting for it for the last 10 years . 
  it 's a big issue there and i think they will legalise it pretty soon . 
  if they are the same thing but we are calling them by different names we might aswell start calling them both by the same name . 
  [ does n't look like it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_greece ) . 
  that only talks about partnerships being introduced by syriza . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  as far as i 'm aware nutrition and diet organisations say that you can have an healthy vegetarian or vegan diet if you plan it well . 
  vegetarian diets can be has healthy as diets that include meat . 
  if you eat sentient animals it 's because you want to , not because you need to . 
  so you would say that you do it for fun ? 
  you do n't need to eat sentient animals to nourish yourself . 
  you do it by choice . 
   you do n't kill the animal just to enjoy its suffering it 's the same for bullfighting . 
  it 's not the suffering that attracts the aficionados to the bullring . 
  in portugal , as far as i know , we only use it to make some desserts . 
  obviously also both ` th ' sounds since they do n't exist in portuguese . 
  i would n't call that a ` scheme ' , it 's more like a context . 
  unless they 're killing off their elderly . 
  what 's good about the scheme ? 
   nowadays we 've like a celebratory coin in like 3 in 3 years and they are n't even about `` our '' country what are you talking about ? 
  we still have plenty of commemorative coins . 
  and fyi , the 1 , 2 and 5 euro cent coins also have royal seals on them , just like the rest of the coins . 
  probably bacalhau . 
  we like bacalhau . 
  until we got fed up with them . 
   it became its de facto name , later becoming its de jure name !, 
  ftfy i suppose . 
  heard the bullying is so damn impressive you wo n't even try to get away . 
  would n't that be a bit impractical given the distance between all of them ? 
   but at least their slaves was n't treated as less than humans . 
  maybe some educated greek slaves were n't , but what about the ones who worked in mines and mills ? 
  what about the ones that worked as prostitutes ? 
  or what about the ones that had to fight for their lives in the games ? 
  you should bear in mind that guns were very limited in that era compared to the following centuries . 
  arquebuses took quite some time to reload and [ volley fire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volley_fire ) was just being invented back then but in europe , so the conquistadores did n't employ that tactic . 
  on the other hand the romans had a far larger population and armed forces to draw from . 
  and they had the same cavalry , steel armour and weapons that also contributed decisively to the spanish conquest . 
  what technologies did the spaniards have that made it so much easier to conquer the americas that the ancient romans did n't have ? 
  the ancient romans were n't the vikings . 
  why 1700 ? 
  the spaniards detroyed the largest american states in the first half ot the 16th century . 
  oh man , does [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0tzyudhfni ) bring back memories . 
  as a child i spent so many of my summer evenings watching this show . 
  i think you are overestimating the relative significance of the last millennium , and yes , i 'm well aware there were very significant epidemics in that era . 
  but smallpox for example had been around for several millennia before the roman republic . 
  do you think all other same sex couples in germany share the opinion you hypothesise your neighbors have ? 
   the romans would not be able to overrun the continent like the spanish did why would n't they ? 
   it 's more of a fad than genes i suppose you do n't have a source on that . 
  but the legislation still passed on parliaments that were chosen by the population . 
  in portugal 's case for example it was passed in the parliament after the portuguese population elected a government that had same-sex marriage has one of their campaign banners . 
  well , actually , if there are genes that make you more likely to be gay in a population , you can be sure it 's because ` nature intended ' it to be that way . 
  ` bad genes ' disappear very fast . 
  in fact there are many examples in nature of genes that make some of it 's bearers less likely to reproduce - like ` gay genes ' - while helping others who might share those genes reproduce more or be more likely to survive long enough to do it , like relatives that for some reason do n't have those behaviors activated . 
  glad i could help then . 
   catholic country i guess you have n't heard the news about belgium , spain , portugal , argentina , brazil , france , uruguay and luxembourg . 
  well , marriage did n't originate with christianity , it predates it by far . 
  in fact many societies have this sort of social contracts . 
   does the word `` marriage '' originate from religion ? 
  not all religions ban same-sex marriages you know ? 
   just without the church you think religions are forced to perform same-sex marriages on the light blue countries ? 
  this kind of laws have nothing to do with churches , churches make their own decisions when it comes to marrying people . 
  maybe that 's a problem with the state budget and not with inheritance taxes per se , do n't you think ? 
  i was talking about the amount of ** unjustified ** police brutality that happens in football games , not about the justified police actions . 
   portuguese police are generally very accountable . 
  except during football games . 
  situations like the one posted are far from uncommon during football games . 
  well , hta . 
  otorrino + laringo + logista but it is indeed fun to say , even your version . 
  we have the same exact joke in portugal . 
  it 's funny though that even if it were true and the word was as long as the alphabet it would still be shorter than our longest word . 
  otorrinolaringologista ? 
  longest non technical : ** anticonstitucionalissimamente ** which kind of means unconstitutionally but not really . 
  shortest are : ** a ** , ** \u00e0 ** , ** e ** , ** \u00e9 ** and ** o ** . 
  there are also three more archaic short words : ** i ** , ** \u00f2 ** and ** u ** . 
  even better , apoint the prior of crato as my heir and step down from the throne as soon as possible . 
  then maybe we can have coins celebrating the end of the war instead of a battle . 
  is it surprising ? 
  do n't working lower classes tend to be more left-wing ? 
  you want us to integrate first with spain ? 
  without you lot ? 
  i 'm no expert but the best i 've drank were ** affligem blonde ** and ** la trappe quadrupel ** . 
  that song is n't recognisable by most portuguese how would it be recognisable abroad ? 
  only because they faced the portuguese . 
  we have a pretty good track record against them considering our relative sizes . 
  we must be seeing different maps . 
  also portugal , france , the uk , belgium and germany , to mention a few , have far more african immigrants than italy , greece , bulgaria , the baltics or central europe . 
  yet the first group has more positive attitudes towards non-eu immigrants . 
  as long as everyone can stay in their relative position on the other side of the ocean i 'm ok with it . 
  california here i come !, 
  many do n't but many non catholics and even non christians do . 
  the vatican is diplomatically quite relevant and more far reaching than the pope itself as a spiritual leader . 
  we all could see it just a few months ago when the pope brought together a protestant christian and an atheist to work on the reestablishment of the diplomatic relations between cuba and the us . 
  they count for roughly half the christians so ` minority ' is quite a stretch . 
   minority christians you mean the largest christian denomination ? 
  you still missed a zero there bud .
