  believe it or not the thing portugal is best known for in spain is for the towels . 
  apparently they all buy their towels here . 
  i do n't know why . 
  maybe they do n't have towels for sale there . 
  as a german learner that 's actually one of my favorite features of your language . 
  and imo it makes everything more simple . 
  genders and declinations are a bitch though . 
  ** drave ** [ 1 ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_h84qgqtm5ra/s-r0qiytasi/aaaaaaaahl8/okiqnp217za/s1600/806501.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://pesnostrilhos.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/0.jpg ) is an abandoned little village on the bottom of a valley . 
  it has no road access , nor elecricity , running water or sewage . 
  there 's a stream going through it though . 
  some of the houses are in ruins but others were bought by a portuguese scouting organisation that has been recovering them . 
  there 's also ** lindoso ** [ 1 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/407080.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://noctulachannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/castelo-do-lindoso.jpg ) with it 's characteristic barns surrounding the castle and giving it a very eerie look . 
   if you meant real guineans from guinea bissau , sure , that would be logic and make sense if they came here rather to another country . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  i said ` refugees from guinea-bissau ' to avoid the confusion if i had used just ` guineans ' . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/multimedia/oratvi/multimedia/imagem/id/5094746/550 ) that was later [ parodied ] ( http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/multimedia/oratvi/multimedia/imagem/id/5169379/550 ) by gato fedorento ? 
   there is no construction . . nothing . . 
  it 's actually bouncing back . 
  but you might be right , i was just pointing out that refugees from guinea-bissau will probably be more likely to stay in portugal than others . 
  i do n't know , if we get mostly refugees from guinea-bissau they might feel more at home with the sizeable guinean community here . 
  and maybe , who knows , repent and become a productive member of society . 
  that 's also what the penal system ~ ~ is ~ ~ should be for . 
  not op , but surprisingly authentic . 
  i mean there are a few italian flavours that made their way into the dishes , like the borlotti beans in the feijoada , but those were very few . 
  in general it looks very authentic , from the dishes , to the beverages and the music . 
  went up to how many ? 
   the eurovision tune gives me a nostalgic safe feeling jeux sans fronti\u00e8res ftw !, 
  let me quote stringer bell on it . 
   well , get on with it motherfu - i would prefer if the uk stayed , but if they 're going to continue electing dozens of ukip meps to the parliament i would rather see them leave . 
  agreed . 
  the one king who is said to be sleeping is the worst king we 've ever had . 
  get your shit together , portugal . 
   trans - ** iberian **  covering everything from the major news of the week and burning social issues , to expat living and la vida local , el pa\u00cds ' team of english-language bloggers offers its opinions , observations and analysis on ** spain and beyond ** . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is this blog about iberian topics in general or is it just about spanish topics ? 
  spain and beyond ? 
  beyond = portugal ? 
  then why did n't they just say spain and portugal ? 
  none of the writers is based in portugal or has any connection to the country , so i guess it 's about spain only . 
  but then why is it called tans - * iberian * , and why is there a [ galo de barcelos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rooster_of_barcelos ) on the header ? 
   far side ftfy it being dark varies . 
  well , you could replace animals with a complex nervous system like cows , pigs or sheep in your diet with insects . 
  i bet it 's way cheaper too . 
   both concern food production as opposed to bullfighting so what ? 
  foie gras is n't an important source of nutrition . 
  no one needs it to survive . 
  it 's as cultural as bullfighting . 
   the first one is an immportant tradition ( way more widespread than corrida ) are you kiding ? 
  you can get away with anything as long as it 's popular enough ? 
  hey , you know what ? 
  slavery and gender inequality were way more widespread than foie gras , good thing people did n't think like you back then !, 
   banning ritual slaughter would be an attack on religious freedom . 
  so it 's cool if it 's religious ? 
  bullfighting aficionados just have to make up a religion to slaughter their bulls ? 
  they do n't have a chance to win in portugal . 
  i actually think they have a better chance to win in spain . 
  portuguese bullfighting is just a sanitized version compared to the spanish one , with a lot less gore . 
  the argument is that the matadores chose to be there and the bull had no choice . 
  i 'm not so sure you would still have that opinion if you had a half a ton beast charging at you at full speed , no matter how tired and bloodied he might be by then . 
  and as of note , no , i 've never had a bull charging at me . 
  and i do n't intend to . 
   other traditionally catholic countries are lagging i wish people would stop bringing up catholicism whenever gay rights are the issue . 
  the [ amount of catholic countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/world_marriage-equality_laws.svg ) with gay friendly legislation should have made it clear by now that there is little correlation between them despite any position the catholic church may have on the issue . 
  but with less anschluss . 
  iberia gets all it 's gas from algeria , they would certainly be happy to start selling some of it beyond the pyrenees . 
   i believe northern europeans work more efficiently . 
  it might be so , but your links only talk about productivity , not efficiency . 
  well , it depends on how they obtained their information . 
  the same thing happens in portugal . 
   in poorer countries you 'll find people working more than 1 job if there are plenty of jobs to be taken . 
  which is n't the case in greece . 
  is there any large city in europe where the majority of the population is a minority in the rest of the country and where there is such a large percentage of disenfranchised and poor neighborhoods ? 
  is there even a city in europe with as many hard drug users as baltimore ? 
  edit : to the people downvoting , i 'm not saying that the riots happened because of the size of the minorities in baltimore . 
  what i 'm saying is that those riots had a clear ` us versus them ' mentality behind them ( bear in mind riots = / = protests ) because those same minorities are overrepresented in the disenfranchised and poor neighborhoods . 
  i took the question as , ` could riots like the ones in baltimore happen in europe ? ', 
  and not as ` could riots happen in europe ? ' . 
  because , obviously , many riots have happened here . 
  but on the other hand you had plenty of leyenda negra to balance it out . 
  plenty of innovation and a low number of ignorants is n't exactly the same thing you know ? 
  still , that kind of diagram should lead people to believe we have two summers and two winters per year . 
  it would never be a plausible explanation for the seasons we have . 
  seems like they would bring a lot of trouble for too little gain . 
  let them keep them . 
  i rarely see earthworms moving around , there are snails everywhere when it rains though . 
  i actually agree with this idea and i 'm a leftist . 
  i want everyone to have access to free healthcare , education , water , housing , etc not because i feel everyone is entitled to it but because i think that if we did n't give it to them some would be pushed to such a desperate situation that they would try to hurt society . 
  and as we have seen it 's becoming increasingly easy for individuals or small groups to cause a lot of destruction . 
  the way to solve this without a social state would be with a police state , and i would rather have the former . 
  the world court should n't prosecute dictators . 
  we should give the assads , gaddafis and husseins a way out to retire in luxury to some caribbean island instead of making them fight for their lives and drag their countries to ruin . 
  i guess he 's implying that spain and greece felt like africa and parts of the middle east when compared to the others . 
  on a related note , i find that opinions towards catholics from the anglosphere on the internet are very influenced by the [ leyenda negra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_leyenda_negra ) . 
  especially when it comes to spanish ( and to an extent portuguese ) history , painting catholics in general on an excessively bad light . 
  because catholics are so much more intolerant of muslims than any other christian groups ? 
   yes , that is true , that is why a mortgage is better than rent , instead of spending money you are basically investing it . 
  in portugal unlike many european countries we tend to try to buy a house instead of renting exactly for the reason you are talking about - which is not necessarily a good idea , btw . 
  but youth in general ca n't afford rent here , much less a mortgage . 
  it is , but there are many different rules . 
  what i find particularly interesting is how much in common we have with french when it comes to what sounds each letter represents .
