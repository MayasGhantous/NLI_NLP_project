  and also being two of the relatively few languages that have nasal vowels . 
  what is it ? 
  the nasal vowels ? 
  especially the half nasal half normal vowel diphthongs ? 
  the several ways to read rs ? 
  [ sjw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_justice#social_justice_warrior ), 
   the real open wound ( and only one ) is not about the selvagens or the ezz and that one of unfortunately far harder to solve . 
  which is ? 
   traditional national ** racing ** colours ftfy, 
  not only that , the labels are often in confusing places ( e.g. 
  nyasaland over northern mozambique ) or are just poor choices like having italian somaliland instead of the more common italian somalia and having british somalia instead of the more common british somaliland . 
  lakes and rivers are represented in the territories of certain countries but not in others , lake victoria for example is cut in half , the niger river disappears on the nigerian frontier and the zambezi disappears outside angola to appear again hundreds of kilometers to the east in mozambique . 
  definitely futsal in second place . 
  historically roller hockey was the second most popular sport but nowadays it fell behind futsal and it must be on par with handball , basketball and volleyball . 
  by number of players basketball came third followed closely by volleyball and ahead of handball and tennis back in 2010 . 
  when it comes to lisbon though i would argue that rugby , surfing and bodyboarding are ahead of volleyball , handball and hockey right behind futsal . 
  maybe on par with basketball . 
  his point is that they have no access to the advantages of marriage . 
  they ca n't take their relationship a step up . 
  that 's actually the case of pristina and podgorica for me .

  i disagree . 
  these are just the european capitals - and it does n't even include all of them - 100 % should be the standard . 
  here in portugal at least i had to learn them all back in the 7th grade . 
   well done !, 
  your score : 100 % 01:11 likewise, 
  yesterday i tried it with bacon . 
  i felt it was danish enough to go well with it . 
  i think i 'm on the right track . 
  got it !, 
  they have already got the tea we grow in portugal - the only european country to grow it other than turkey and russia - we were the ones who introduced it to them after all . 
  and also the port and madeira wines , they tend to like those . 
  hungary will have to step up her game . 
  it 's hard to compete with a partner who 's been doing business with them for so many centuries you see . 
  today for lunch i had chickpeas and bacalhau . 
  boil the bacalhau and an egg and when they 're done had a can of pre-boiled chickpeas to the pot to heat them up . 
  take the bacalhau and hard boiled egg out and drain the chickpeas . 
  mixed them up with a bit of minced raw onion and parsley and season the mix with ground black or white pepper . 
  drizzle the chickpeas , the bacalhau and the egg with a generous amount of a nice olive oil . 
  and [ voil\u00e0 ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d1sybhraqpw/tgjfuqlp5yi/aaaaaaaaays/hcunen-h4a0/s1600/salada+bacalhau+grao.gif ) !, 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ my ^ ^ picture some people like boiled potatoes and cabbage with the chickpeas . 
  if you want to try that just boil them with the bacalhau . 
  my sister went to k\u00f8benhavn for easter and brought me back a rygbr\u00f8d just like the one on the left . 
  do you have any tips on how to eat it ? 
  what is it good with ? 
  also columbus being a portuguese nobleman and not the son of a genoese merchant . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  i 'm as anti-monarchic as they come and i agree with miguelvc . 
  for almost 800 years our national colors were blue and white , and then a political party changed them to their own . 
  i would . 
  i would mind a fucking lot . 
  we tried changing to utc +1 back in the mid 90s and it was horrible . 
  edit : i would n't mind changing to utc-1 and dropping dst though . 
  you 're not the one to decide . 
  estonia can into nordic . 
  btw , i too am against the agreement . 
  actually , in portugal both [ * anan\u00e1s * ] ( http://www.continente.pt/pt-pt/public/pages/searchresults.aspx?k=anan%c3%a1s ) and [ * abacaxi * ] ( http://www.continente.pt/pt-pt/public/pages/searchresults.aspx?k=abacaxi ) are used . 
  they are synonyms although some would argue that * anan\u00e1s * refers to the acidic varieties and * abacaxi * to the sweeter ones . 
  what part of  europeans , if you mean ` the people in europe ' were not always white did n't you understand ? 
  people in northern europe descended from the same swarthy people out of africa , they evolved white skin as an adaptation to the northern european environment . 
   due to the influence of roman catholicism , ** portugal is one of the most socially conservative countries in europe . 
  ** abortion was only legalised through a referendum in 2007 , causing much controversy . 
  a catholic priest vowed to excommunicate all people voting in favour of legalising abortion . 
  damn . 
  give me a moment , i 'll have to ask the ecb to loan me some money . 
  how many of you are you ? 
   how 's the economy in portugal these days ? 
  in the gutter but slowly recovering some say . 
  in alentejo in particular the [ port of sines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_sines ) with it 's lng terminal and the nearby oil refineries brings in some jobs and there 's also the industrial areas on the south bank of the tagus , on the other side from lisbon which is n't really part of alentejo but it still kind of is , especially politically . 
  other than that , alentejo has plenty of potential when it comes to agriculture since the [ alqueva dam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alqueva_dam ) was built , especially if you go for the niche crops or the local products . 
  there 's also some rural or agrotourism potential with lots of farmhouses being converted into charming little hotels , although alentejo as a tourism destination has n't yet managed to become really popular abroad . 
  throughout alentejo and the algarve , just south of it , there are a fair number of british , german and dutch expats , in particular on the coastal areas . 
  they move there for the weather and the slower pace of life i believe , and usually they do either some farming or open a small hotel/restaurant . 
  for some professions like medical doctors , it professionals or in engineering in general you 'll have an easy time finding a job . 
  for others , especially in the highly competitive portuguese construction sector , you 'll only find poorly paid positions at most . 
  if you want to know more , or other opinions other than my own , you should ask on / r/portugal how 's life and job opportunities in alentejo . 
  edit : since you mentioned you or you 're so is australian , for some reason there are always many australian tourists in [ lagos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagos,_portugal ) , on the algarve . 
  i do n't know why that is , but i go there often and it 's the place in portugal where you can find the most australians by far . 
  i would pay to know who the silent downvoting crew in these posts is . 
  i 'm from lisbon , but my mom 's family is from there and i spent many summers in alentejo when i was younger . 
  be warned though that it 's not really a commune , alentejo voters vote for either socialist or communist parties but there is no regional government , only local , so while almost every city and town there has [ a socialist ( ps ) or communist ( cdu ) mayor ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/portuguese_local_elections_2013_result_map.png ) , they are still governed by the [ epp-aligned ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_social_democrats ) central portuguese government . 
  well , i can stand a bit colder than 18\u00ba , altough places where it snows would be pushing it . 
  san diego would be a good option too if i ever moved to that area because i 'm profecient in both english and spanish . 
   i get a ton of happiness just feeling the sun on my face . 
   plus i 'm a full blown socialist and borderline communist these days you 'd fit in just right in alentejo , western europe 's red country . 
  i 've never been to the us but while i agree with you about how awesome the whole west coast seems - and i 'm including vancouver there - i ca n't picture myself living anywhere north of san francisco , it 's too damn cold for my portuguese bones . 
  get me a job on an architecture studio in socal and i 'm off across the pond . 
  i would love to live in the us for some years . 
  i would eventually want to return to portugal though . 
  and do n't even get started on the j. 
  every language seems to read it differently . 
  evangelical churches are on the rise though . 
  and they tend to be creationists . 
  back in school i had a colleague who said she was creationist . 
  when we first started learning evolution theory she told the class she did n't believe any of that . 
  but to be fair , she was n't that bright anyway . 
  everyone started arguing with her and she said she was a creationist because of her religious beliefs , which is odd since the catholic church does n't consider the genesis to be factual or that evolution is untrue - and so we told her . 
  she then shut up and never brought it up again . 
  i do n't know then . 
  but the truth is that racist/xenophobic parties have no expression there .
