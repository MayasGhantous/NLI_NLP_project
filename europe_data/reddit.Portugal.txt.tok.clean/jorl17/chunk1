all i meant was that if the website was bypassing youtube 's embedding restriction ( which is relatively easy to do ) , then it could be infringing on youtube 's tos, 
  the new regulation coming from the eu will probably force youtube to behave in the way you suggested . 
  agreed it 's required . 
  one should note that just because videos are hosted on youtube , it is not necessarily according to their terms of service to embed them , even with their own api . 
  some ( all ? 
  do n't know ) of these restrictions to the tos are present in the api itself , which refuses allowing embedding of such videos , although this restriction might be bypassed . 
  does ultimate music embed videos using the official api ? 
  for _ all _ of their videos ? 
  some videos are not available for embedding , even if you use the official api . 
  these videos , mostly related to music , are lightly protected to only be played in domains such as youtube.com or facebook.com . 
  it is relatively trivial to counter these restrictions , although doing so goes against the youtube terms of service . 
  are you sure that this website did not infringe on these rights ? 
  honest question i am also against most of the blocks , but i think the kind of horde mentality claiming that there 's some kind of mass conspiracy to block useless-to-most-people websites is too much . 
  there is nothing to be gained in doing so , and i think people are just looking with the ever-so-present portuguese take of `` everything is always wrong and the establishment is always out to get us '' . 
  sometimes shit happens because shit people are shit at their jobs . 
  certainly that must be fixed , but people should n't jump to conclusions without concrete evidence . 
  edit : regarding this specific case , once again , it 's bollocks and pathetic . 
  in particular the reply that they received is bollocks . 
  nevertheless , i think people need to think straight and avoid ludicrous claims, 
  i like to see the ~ ~ upvotes ~ ~ downvotes . 
  so many prima donnas . 
   they 're trying to solve it any way they can . 
  exactly . 
  they 're trying to solve their problems , not those of the country . 
  gather them all in a farm , and then unleash the flamethrower . 
  metaphorically speaking , of ^ course ^ i ^ do n't ^ really ^ mean ^ it ^ yes ^ i ^ do, 
   that 's very different from what you said previously that the parties were saying . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that sentence . 
  that 's how all coalitions are formed . 
  you are correct , i was not clear enough . 
  in fact , i was just wrong , to be honest . 
  but i 'll stand by this : a coalition between parties with such different positions and views only expresses a deranged quest for power . 
  ** nobody cares about the people ** . 
  if psd/cds and ps were in their right mind , they would join up -- they have the most similar programs and ideals ; in fact , their only difference is in the name , really , kind of like some prefer fc porto or sl benfica . 
  psd and cds have explicitly invited ps to do so , and have even shown that they are flexible ( if that 's just on paper , i do n't know , maybe it is ) . 
  i personally blame costa * the most * for this -- and for the disaster that is sure to follow . 
  exactly , but their programs were similar ( much like ps 's are to the current coalition 's ) . 
  that , and the fact it was a coalition with the party that effectively won . 
  and you may not have heard the left parties saying that , but i have . 
  just go around facebook , twitter or your local political debate . 
  it 's maybe not out there with those words , but something more along the lines of `` the left has a majority , ergo they have to form a coalition , it is their * absolute duty to the people ! * '' . 
  no , they do not -- again , psd/cds/ps also have a majority ; a larger one , and one with much more compatible ideas . 
  take your shoddy politics somewhere else , damn political parties !, 
  they will . 
  this interesting and unbelievable concoction for power made up of traditional ps pretending to be `` left-leaning '' , coupled with anti-euro parties will try to get power . 
  they do n't care about the people . 
  ** they just want power ** . 
  if they cared , they 'd be looking at our fucking debt skyrocketing and just help setup a damn government . 
  oh yeah , but wait , they have to go to the government and give up 2/3 of their political programs because `` that 's what people voted for '' . 
  sure , * that 's * what they voted for . 
  i am absolutely disgusted by what 's going on this country . 
  note that this does n't mean that i want psd/cds to be ruling . 
  it just means that i do n't want the other ones to get there just for the sake of power . 
  i want what 's best for the country , a country that is part of the world and whose inner battles have a deep long-lasting effect on its economy . 
  just use your goddamned brains . 
  yes , you are right , but what i really mean is that all these claims that `` the people voted for a left coalition '' , which have been implied if not outright said , are as pathetic as the political parties we have themselves . 
  it makes no sense to try and act like you know the ** intentions ** of people when they voted -- you just know ** who they voted for ** . 
  the rest ? 
  ** disgusting political agendas ** . 
  yeah , but then again , using the same logic , ** 69.1 % want psd , cds/pp and ps to join up and form government ** . 
  people voted for parties , not for intentions . 
  stop making them up for your own agendas . 
  from [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pxocz/eurozone_crosses_rubicon_as_portugals_antieuro/cwatojx )  i would advise you to read lots of replies . 
  many , many , many people would consider his decision valid . 
  think of it this way :   * the party with the most votes has ** always ** been appointed  * coalitions have been formed before , but only with the party with the ** most votes **  * the so called `` left coalition '' is made up of parties with ** ridiculously different plans and ideals ** , and have never been considered `` close '' ( i mean the two smaller parties to the bigger one , ps )  * the smaller parties of the left coalition are ** anti-euro ** , ** anti-nato ** and ** anti-lots-of-stuff ** . 
  now you think if it 's reasonable to have those parties leading portugal while the country is still trying to ** kick the crisis and is still very entangled with europe **   all in all , the criticism he gets is because of his words . 
  he clearly wanted to pass the message that it is ** extremely irresponsible to put these parties in power ** . 
  that the people ** did not vote for them because they like their `` anti-eu things '' ** , but because they wanted to ** merely vote against the coalition currently in party ** . 
    it is the president 's view that the ideals of these parties go directly ** against the established social needs of the country ** , its ** reputation in europe ** ( which ultimately affects its economy and trade power ) , and several of the ** values ** of the portuguese people . 
    think about it : ** psd and ps hold a very large majority ** , and have * really * close programs , and ** none of them have any of these anti-eu politics ** . 
  all in all , i think that the president 's move was somewhat of a timid cry for psd and ps to get along . 
    if you want to manipulate the damn results , do it the right way -- ** the people did n't vote for `` anti-psd '' , at least not any more than they voted `` psd/ps '' ** . 
  i 'd like to really note that last point : this is mostly manipulation of the results to fit each and every parties ' agenda . 
  the arguments being thrown everywhere are just as pathetic as the political system in portugal itself -- and the clowns pretending to care at the parliament . 
  one could also argue that psd/cds/ps won . 
  but of course , nobody is interested in that additional manipulation of the results . 
  what this has resulted in for most of the people around me is a much bigger increase in disbelief in any of the political parties -- it has become clear that they are not anything more than just an agenda for their own .

  i think he appointed the minority government in hopes that we do n't really get to the point of having a left coalition . 
  that would be a massive problem for us on so many levels . 
  if we were isolated from the world , i guess it could work . 
  but in the real world , we will crash and burn if it really happens . 
  not that anybody seems to care . 
  everybody `` won '' . 
  bunch of asinine motherfuckers . 
  well , that sort of clears it up . 
  nevertheless , i have a couple of friends leaning towards fascism and they would also disagree . 
  whatever happens , i do n't really give a damn if it 's left or right -- the system is broken by design ( so would fascism be ) . 
  all i want is that progress is made , even if we have to be puppets of europe , cuba or lezoto . 
  this is so delusional . 
  not even my most left-wing friends can be so washed up .
