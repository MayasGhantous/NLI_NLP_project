  it 's quite the infantile tactic . 
  it would only stop if they were to actually win . 
  but if they were to win , i doubt that any election after that would be the same . 
  when europe was that ? 
  [ porto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porto ) is a 30 year old teenager , part-time employed , and with an appetite for life 's simplest of pleasures . 
  all he needs is his friends , music , football and a beach ( or an esplanade ) to photosynthesize is chronic and soul-crushing depression away . 
  let 's never grow up . 
  that is n't the real problem . 
  any other model would have broken down as well . 
  sustainability on planet earth and ecological footprints are the real issue . 
  we 're just living the great normalization that resulted from globalization and free flow of capital . 
  nevertheless , the problem has not disappeared . 
  globalization was just the catalyst . 
  it will all break down and we will have to rethink civilization once more . 
  so , you 're downplaying this recession and rationalizing it 's eventual passing and return to growth ? 
  i do n't see it that way and understand your stance but sadly that 's what most leaders preach and it cripples any political action . 
  the demagogy rages while a growing number of eu citizens slip into 4 ^ th world living standards . 
  i urge to reassess all the signs and try to see the bigger picture . 
  this is n't going to pass . 
  we 're at the event horizon of debt and resource depletion . 
  beyond that , who knows ... but things definitely wo n't ever be like before !, 
  what ? 
  you 're confusing what i said . 
  that 's not the comparison i 'm making . 
  i 'm merely comparing adjacent generations . 
  our fathers gained significant improvements and took part in an upward growth of living standards and opportunities . 
  nowadays the trend is reversing for the first time in history . 
  portuguese here !, 
  my number one would go to moonspell !, 
  their 3 first albums ( [ under the moonspell ] ( http://youtu.be/eglkqffx7dg ) , [ wolfheart ] ( http://youtu.be/fzpjch7mp6i ) and [ irreligious ] ( http://youtu.be/lw0vqpgz16c ) are beyond description . 
  -- but in the pop scenario here are some popular bands and musicians : * [ xutos & pontap\u00e9s ] ( http://youtu.be/jm-zcgru4-c ) * [ david fonseca ] ( http://youtu.be/konqcru9lni ) * [ gnr ] ( http://youtu.be/hfccluvonh8 ) * [ madredeus ] ( http://youtu.be/fzb6l8trek0 ) * [ deolinda ] ( http://youtu.be/qxv9s3ptizy ) * [ humanos ] ( http://youtu.be/ezinamnanuc ) * [ cl\u00e3 ] ( http://youtu.be/wdvv4gh1xd8 ) * [ ornatos violeta ] ( http://youtu.be/yhh_d9e5taa ) * [ pedro abrunhosa ] ( http://youtu.be/xzv8wcthbwg ) * lu\u00eds represas * rui veloso * [ paulo gonzo ] ( http://youtu.be/ggjaezomt7g ) * [ the gift ] ( http://youtu.be/dfoqxrapn48 ) * aurea * mariza * [ caman\u00e9 ] ( http://youtu.be/kawhcgtnvaq ) * [ maria jo\u00e3o & m\u00e1rio laginha ] ( http://youtu.be/kaggwl7wugo ) here 's also some really portuguese oldies i grew up with . 
  whoever is down-voting you has failed to realize that we 're the first generation to live with fewer rights and wealth than the previous one . 
  this trend is here to stay !, 
  and yes , resources will become ever more scarce and fought over . 
  anyone with half a brain can read this in the markets everyday . 
   pretty much every generation ever has thought that they were or would be on the brink of destruction . 
  true , but never in a so scientifically substantiated form . 
  resources are dimming and competition will kick into high gear . 
  a united europe might stand a better chance . 
  also , for that ted talk , how [ many ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_gilding_the_earth_is_full.html ) do you want affirming the opposite and that we are near the event horizon of debt and resource depletion ? 
  do n't be a denialist . 
  you can be optimistic and engaging without denying things . 
  otherwise you 're just being a catalyst for the mess that is to unfold . 
  and they already had it !, 
  back in the days of * abba * . 
  back tehn , they could 've toured into any country and make any army disband !, 
  cuba is the symbol of a successful defiance that accounts for the venomous hostility towards it by the us . 
  also , cuba 's sociopolitical model is the north american opposite . 
  but [ noam chomsky ] ( http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/11/03/an-interview-with-noam-chomsky-on-cuba/ ) really explains it better than anyone . 
  the moment when us dollars are no longer the world 's reserve currency is the moment that shit has hit the fan , big time !!, 
  that will be the time the us will really start shamelessly looking at everything with cross-hairs on . 
  as portuguese , i can confirm the whole desert thing . 
  i ca n't remember last time it rained !, 
  everything 's drying up around here . 
  all it takes is one . 
  and it does n't even have to be a big one . 
  or maybe a prolonged storm or blizzard . 
  the existential risks it poses are not worth it . 
  besides , all the mined uranium in the world would only last a few decades more were we to switch on energy sources . 
  the solution is either nuclear fusion or some other high yield renewable source of energy coupled with a radical change in consumption behaviors . 
  in the growing acidic ocean scientists foresee a sudden drop in fish stocks ( in just a couple of years ) due to mass die off of plankton . 
  this will hike prices on any type of sea food . 
  on land , we 're facing longer and longer dry spells and extreme seasons . 
  depletion of aquifers will lead to conflicts over rivers . 
  dams will cut countries dry ( it has happened between portugal and spain ) . 
  icebergs could be towed in ( happened in the uk ) . 
  farm land will dominate the landscape and everyone will necessarily be living out of it . 
  brutal heat waves and cold fronts will take their toll on the old and the young . 
  tens or even hundreds of thousands could die annually from it instead of a few thousands each year . 
  i do n't believe the current economical system can be maintained any longer with or without agw , but agw will definitely be strong a catalyst . 
  think of insurance company 's losses , or the costs of dwindling resources like food , rare earth metals , minerals ( like uranium ) , energy , etc. 
  all things that are going down in quantity coupled with the added strain on getting them , like energy costs , transportation , environmental costs . 
  health will become a problem given the pollution from industries and shale gas fracking . 
  antibiotics are becoming useless against germs and extreme weather weakens populations favoring diseases . 
  old diseases are returning with a vengeance , like tb . 
  a lot more starvation due to scarcity . 
  return to local food production . 
  violence albeit under control . 
  ever higher taxes . 
  an unavoidable complete privatization of health , education and social security will deprive the majority of it and will create more social asymmetries . 
  eventually people will be living in smaller communities . 
  a return to city states . 
  local currencies , laws and independence from former centralized forms of government . 
  7 billion people are impossible to sustain over time , even with current technology , no agw or any other mishap along the way . 
  the ecological footprint is simply unsustainable . 
  if you have the time , check out this [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomwzjrribg ) . 
  it sums it up . 
  build nuclear plants you say ? 
  is n't it quite the gamble ? 
  what of natural catastrophe ? 
  earthquakes , storms , solar flares , etc. . . 
  between $ 0.60 and an $ 1 . 
  cheap , you may say , but we have significantly lower incomes at our disposal ( minimum wage is $ 485/month ) and also the highest rate of coffee shops and restaurants per capita . 
  edit : with the fuck am i being downvoted ? 
  portugal really stands out as having the lowest crime rate in the capital city versus the rest of the country . 
  not that i ever thought it would n't be peaceful . 
  it merely shows police as more active in the cities while an abandoned rural area remains * wild * . 
  i would love to visit scandinavia and denmark to really draw my own conclusions on it being colder/inhospitable than the south . 
  i love the cold as well as the warm weather and think it 's great to have them both with such plentifulness over at portugal . 
  however , there 's a type of weather that i love here in oporto and that we do n't get that often lately due to agw .
