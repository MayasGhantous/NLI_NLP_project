  fine . 
  even though that 's complete bs with ethoncentric undertones . 
  would you actually mind ? 
  i do n't identify myself with you guys nor do i have anything in common with you or any german . 
  the thing is , we leave and the `` party is over '' . 
  i suspect it 's no different than the portuguese military . 
  nepotism , absurdly excessive number of high ranking officers , huge salaries and automatic career progressions , high levels of administrative corruption . 
  try saying no to those guys . 
  that seems to be the golden rule across europe . 
  whoever has the gold makes up the rules . 
  this thread again ? 
  i can tell you that catholic countries have their stats skewed . 
  it 's common to lie on reports or even refuse coroner examination . 
  families pressure into having religious ceremonies and not even hinting to suicide . 
  who would 've known !? 
  germany profiting from the way the union 's internal market was designed !, 
  maybe , just maybe , it has to do with them calling the shots on nearly everything ? 
  and bullying other countries whenever it suits them ? 
  maybe these presumed selfless and sophisticated do-no-harm poster boys for modern europe are not so selfless after all . 
  in fact , maybe their full of skeletons in their closets . 
  maybe they 're hijacking this union into a modern reich to serve their own greedy interests . 
  love it !, 
  particularly the untied states . 
  the amount of confusion and grammar nazis coming out of the woodwork over this would be very fitting . 
  actually not , but given the self-victimization train has left the station and is going full speed ... everyone jump in !, 
  those poor upstanding roma gypsies are being discriminated against !, 
  it 's okay , because these are serbs were talking here - the most hated people in europe by europeans . 
  and kosovars being the ever self-victimized muslim bunch , can actually get away with everything . 
  from organ harvesting , slavery , brutal levels of criminality ... [ were it in reverse and everyone would be losing their shit at how evil serbs are . 
  ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g1367990406140510432.jpg ) serbia should win a god damn medal for even continuing to exist in that powder keg they call the balkans . 
  and kosovo is a mafia state that should n't exist at all . 
  a union that deals in secrecy , not just from its citizens but sometimes from member states as well , is no union . 
  it does n't want citizen input , transparency or public discussion nor it adheres to democratic principles . 
  it merely wants to strengthen the cronyism and their immense profit . 
  let 's just agree to disband once and for all . 
  i hope that as he falls he brings down the entirety of the political corrupt cohorts that enabled them . 
  if he does that , then all his actions will be redeemed . 
  i suspect well over half of our countries current political heads are tainted with high level corruption and are more worthy of jail than public office . 
  this is the alcohol response everyone is looking for . 
  [ porto wine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_wine ) is simply delicious and ubiquitous in portugal . 
  as is [ moscatel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscatel ) , which is my favorite . 
  [ licor beir\u00e3o ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/licor_beir%c3%a3o ) is also a good liquor to gulp down after dinner . 
  in the summer , i enjoy a slightly sparkling and lighter [ ros\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ros%c3%a9 ) . 
  but tea is my drink . 
  green tea in particular . 
  i drink copious amounts of tea every day . 
  i enjoy mixing green tea leaves with other , like eucalyptus leafs . 
  makes the drink even more refreshing . 
  no milk . 
  milk depresses me and puts me in a torpid state . 
  switzerland ? 
  full circle ? 
  that 's probably the lhc !, 
  omg !, 
  putin wants to create a black hole in the center of europe !, 
  q : hey u/khthon , how much do you feel like a citizen of the eu ? 
  that pic is a long standing joke among us actually . 
  i 've been receiving that old woman 's picture on my email pretty regularly since the dawn of the internet . 
  you see , portuguese excel at making fun of each other . 
  portuguese girl [ pic here ] ( http://ilikeitfunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hot-fifa-world-cup-portuguese-girl-flag-bikini-face-painting-f78237.jpg ) . 
  nothing to write home about but definitely better than [ the one ] ( http://spf.fotolog.com/photo/63/25/20/clauser/1147469422_f.jpg ) i was expecting to see ... 
  bonus [ portuguese girl here ] ( http://www.lapatilla.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sara-sampaio-for-calzedonia-2013-008.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://us.cdn281.fansshare.com/photos/sarasampaio/sara-sampaio-be-magazine-334984414.jpg ) . 
  what you find ridiculous i find hypocritical and discrediting . 
  yes , realpolitik is , sadly , all about self-interests !, 
  just do n't act surprised when things backfire spectacularly like in this situation . 
  as did afghanistan/iraq . 
  as did libya and many others that are following suit . 
  any sort of moral high ground is lost , when you value economic interests alone . 
  this in turn makes for political weakness , public distrust and epic levels of cynicism . 
  you want that ? 
  you think that is the solution to the worlds problems ? 
  it will broker the end of generational long standing conflicts ? 
  that 's the equivalent to building walls and not giving a damn on what happens on the other side . 
  i seriously think we should have moved past that point by now , in terms of civilization . 
  and being complacent or maybe a cynic , while a good coping strategy , does n't help anyone in the long run . 
  water and arable soil . 
  diverting or damming rivers . 
  fishing rights . 
  we 're a hungry bunch , like u/muupeerd said , and our eco footprints is unsustainable . 
  and global warming , which the usual optimists always ignore , will force millions into europe from africa and the middle east . 
  and when europeans surpass a couple of billion , then the stress will be too much . 
  aquifers will dry , food prices will soar and social unrest will follow . 
  also , to the same optimists claiming desalinization as a solution , thirst wo n't be a problem , mass watering of crops will . 
  and the process consumes much energy . 
  waiting for some technological miracle similar to the green revolution and nitrogen extraction . 
  also , peak phosphorous and soil exhaustion will play their part . 
  / u/sasquatchpl was pointing out the typical selfishness that dictates many eu countries foreign policy . 
  zero solidarity towards ailing countries is hardly a founding principle to push forward a union . 
  because it was not a dutch problem , they only cared for their economic interests , regardless of the killing and oppression elsewhere . 
  well , now it is a dutch problem and the diplomatic progression of things reads like a biblical parable . 
  it 's just not reached that tipping point . 
  take into account these are civilized educated and secular people with plenty of grief in their collective history . 
  if things continue to degrade , and all indicates it will , resistance will become organized . 
  future wars will likely be wars of insurgency , over control of natural resources and self-determination . 
  if you think terrorism is an abused label these days , wait for when the world starts hitting the many non-negotiable natural and economical limits . 
  it will be a fast progression from there to absolute chaos and i have no doubt the handling of such crisis by the eu will be poor and will hang the periphery to dry . 
  do n't be so sure . 
  things can go bad pretty fast . 
  wars are on a near horizon for europe . 
  and i suspect it will happen between europeans , again ...
