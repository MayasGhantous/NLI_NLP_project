  it can and probably will be obscure by european standards . 
  but al it needs is to be big in your native land . 
  also , try to add it in list format with a quick link to youtube or something audible .

  uhf - [ rua do carmo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csbct03jo4q ) obviously i 'm just putting a few i 'm reading from the back of a best of i got my hands on . 
  feel free to add . 
  if this gets any traction , we can move on to the 90 's and 00 's . 
  the ideal leader in apathetic times . 
  how can a government , so committed to give up their citizens right to privacy to foreign powers , and that pursues a policy of totalitarianesque surveillance , actually win with absolute majority ? 
  and some here wonder why i have such a pessimistic view of europe and the future ... 
  they could even be inside a swedish river , i do n't think the russians would care . 
  good news everyone !, 
  probably where he lives . 
  say you 'll invest in fracking up the place and maybe he 'll change his mind . 
  planning another invasion ? 
  i ca n't believe southern europe is still being referred as piigs in economic reports ... 
  it 's exasperating . 
  the arrogance and offensiveness is off the charts . 
  the basic truth is israel needs it 's `` lebensraum '' and also a large buffer zone to protect itself from it 's neighboring countries and of course , radical islam . 
  there will never be peace . 
  and israel knows it and is well prepared for it . 
  agreed , but then again many people , governments , historians even , denialists and revisionists will go to great lengths to skew history in their favor or to leave out certain parts . 
  if nothing is said against it , it becomes truth . 
  and reinforces bias against certain peoples . 
  got very little to do with national pride . 
  my country constantly being dismissed , told to pay debts , be labelled lazy , incompetent , inferior , ... has become a bit excessive here and pretty much everywhere , even if made very subtly . 
  funny how that does n't stink or is n't unbecoming and is actually popular . 
  not really . 
  forming a party can totally be for selfish reasons , rather than ideological ones . 
  also , having a party makes you eligible for funding from the state . 
  i would n't be surprised if they were trying out new ways of lobbying for more privileges , more welfare , more land , more immunity from criminal prosecution . 
  completely legal imho . 
  but a complete ideological fraud and far far away from a much needed ( and wished for by many ) serious rehabilitating movement . 
  5 million germans ( bavaria , swabia , etc. ), 
  and 1.9 million dutch in 1650 . 
  portugal had 1.1 million . 
  nothing was forgotten . 
  it was just kept as a secret , due to obvious reasons , one being that the portuguese were being actively corrupted by european powers . 
  a thing that still happens to this day . 
  and i still believe there is anti portuguese sentiment at play here , even though your after comment addresses the dutch . 
  and this is not some inferiority complex . 
  it goes back hundreds of years and has deep and well proven historical grounds . 
  if we dare say portuguese , the argument against us is that australians discovered australia 50 000 years ago . 
  but if were talking the dutch or the british , then that argument does n't even get called for . 
  sure thing buddy . 
  british insularity and demographics/size/resources of their island pretty much guaranteed success , once scotland was absorbed . 
  you may not know this byt we had to plant massive pine fields one hundred years in advance of the discoveries to have raw materials to build ships . 
  such decisions rest on great kings , which were rare . 
  we also had to fend off the spanish kingdoms . 
  we could n't replace the armies and eventually found ourselves spread too thin . 
  our demographics was even a third lower than the dutch in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  there were also greater interests at play , such as the habsburgs , the medici , the rothschilds , capetians , bourbons , who were active in limiting us in our expansion efforts . 
  we were routinely robbed in mid ocean by corsairs at these families payroll . 
  we were more spied and corrupted than most kingdoms . 
  our kings and governments were all mediocre ( as today ) because foreign interests dictated them . 
  we were also 10:1 population-wise in relation to spain and still came out independent and won many decisive battles . 
  but not without it 's toll . 
  and always against the will of the ruling monarchs who were weak and mere puppets . 
  initiative came mostly from the people and spontaneous gatherings of distinct noblemen families . 
  hardly ever they came from the courts . 
  those same issues things still hold true today . 
  it was hard for me not to read your comment as arrogant . 
  implying if there was a germany , that you 'd likely top that list . 
  probably just an issue of mine ... nevermind . 
  this is fascinating . 
  had that population survived ... 
  while on the megafauna topic , there was also a [ giant lemur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megaladapis ) that was still around in madagascar around the time of the portuguese discoveries . 
  do n't worry , the post is still * fresh * . 
  in no time the southern bashers will be here to shoot us down . 
  how dare we - untermensch - claim to have done any kind of historical good . 
  australia and even antarctica was discovered by the portuguese some 250 years before the british . 
  there is proof . 
  it is of course , denied with a passion . 
  blame this on the anglocentric world that almost was n't . 
  i 've seen the 34k number in other sources as well . 
  the question now is related how much of that map is accurate ? 
  we ca n't really compare ourselves to lies . 
  i urge other redditors to call all this data into question like you did . 
  thank you for your inquisitive and skeptical mind . 
  do n't worry , they 're gradually joining . 
  maybe not the geographical country but a relevant part of their demography . 
  as well as other populations from north african and middle eastern countries . 
  i feel somewhat ~ ~ proud ~ ~ saddened of my country . 
  abortion is a legal option here and still , abortion is a very low occurrence . 
  and there are hardly stigmas or people frowning upon it , apart from the odd pious medical worker ( a rarity ) . 
  if it happens , it 's mostly because of the lack of responsibility/family planning and not because some brutish religious reasoning . 
  keep in mind we 're a catholic country . 
  either this or the data reporting is messed up . 
  bu i do believe it to be correct as it correlates with what i see and read about . 
  edit : apparently the map is bs for portugal , and likely to other countries as well . 
  after / u/uyth replied to me , i did some math and came up with very troubling numbers , given the low birthrate in my country . 
  we should be red with 35 % instead of a deep blue .
