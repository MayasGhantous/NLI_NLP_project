  how about 600 years of portuguese sovereignty over [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) ? 
  why is n't there a referendum at all ? 
  why the anxious effort to erase all traces of portuguese culture ? 
  and failing miserably ... [ irredentism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irredentism ) at it 's finest . 
  some countries hypocrisy is mind boggling . 
  this has all the traits of former yugoslavia and none of the temperament , which is why nobody gave took up arms for them . 
  but never mistake that as acceptance . 
  catalonia has n't accepted as well . 
  the basques have not accepted also . 
  only chauvinists still push for this . 
  spain should also follow international law on the [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) issue . 
  the only intolerable thing is intolerance . 
  such highly reductive personality tests = horse shit test that says very little about yourself and basically further empowers whoever has the decision making competences . 
  even the very use of it as a stress test is a very poor choice . 
  i can reason pros and cons for every option and debate them to great lengths on how one is better than the other . 
  maybe portugal should put up ridiculous fees as well because of [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) . 
  oh wait a minute , we already do !, 
  we also make them stand in line by the freeways in the blazing sun to pay in cryptic pay booths that often breakdown . 
  nordic beauty is of kebab only, 
  we have quite a few of those heroes . 
  notoriously [ an\u00edbal milhais ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an%c3%adbal_milhais ) , was one of the most decorated soldiers of world war i. 
  '' [ milhais ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:soldier_an%c3%adbal_milhaisii.png ) stood up with his lewis machine gun and defeated , almost single handedly , two german assaults by laying down intense fire , leaving hundreds of germans dead . 
  his bravery under severe circumstances managed to convince the germans that they were up against a fortified unit rather than just a single portuguese soldier with a machine gun . 
  a few months later , [ milhais ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:an%c3%adbal_%22soldado_milh%c3%b5es%22_milhais.jpg ) again held back the germans , standing alone with his lewis gun and allowing a belgian unit to retreat safely to a secondary trench without casualties . '', 
  another one is [ peter francisco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_francisco ) , who carried an 1,100-pound cannon on his shoulder to keep it from falling into enemy hands . 
  was also a hero of the american revolution . 
  but my favorite , and more epically sung , is [ padeira de aljubarrota ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/padeira_de_aljubarrota ) , which translates as the `` woman baker of aljubarrota '' . 
  this brave and strong woman , during the 1385 [ battle of aljubarrota ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aljubarrota ) , killed 7 castillans who were hidding in an oven . 
  and she did it with her work paddle . 
  definition of * epic hero * : a main character in an epic whose legendary or heroic actions are central to his/her culture , race , or nation . 
  we had pretty successful campaigns against islam . 
  nothing sneaky though . 
  pretty much straight military tactic and force . 
  [ pelagius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelagius_of_asturias ) is an epic hero from that time , establishing a christian kingdom and marking the beginning of the end for islam in iberia . 
  portugal and switzerland also have huge closet skeletons in regards to nazi gold . 
  wo n't stop anyone from trying . 
  oh , we 're paying ... 
  `` skanderbeg spent the following winter of 1466 -- 1467 in italy , of which several weeks were spent in rome trying to persuade pope paul ii to give him money . 
  at one point , he was unable to pay for his hotel bill , and he commented bitterly that he should be fighting against the church rather than the ottomans . '', 
  i 'm sorry but it does n't get any more albanian than this . 
  he 's the reason europe was n't overrun by islam . 
  the feats of this one are hard to beat . 
  long before portugal was formed , in what is today northern portugal , lived a [ lusitanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusitanians ) shepherd turned warrior who united the tribes and successfully fought off the romans until betrayed by his own . 
  his name was [ viriathus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viriathus ) . 
  there is strong evidence we reached australia and antarctica long before any other european explorer . 
  i could n't agree less . 
  our first king was n't spanish , in the sense that spain as a country or kingdom , or as a union of various kingdoms , did n't exist back then !, 
  you should know that the kingdom of portugal precedes the kingdom of spain . 
  spain derives from hispania , which is a roman term for the iberian peninsula . 
  it was later used by the other kingdoms . 
  to me it gives no legitimacy to any claim spaniards may place on portugal . 
  history proves we do n't want it . 
  too bad if some chauvinistic leader see us as a geographical error from across the border . 
  that actually delights me . 
  and he can spend his time drawing up maps on how to invade and subdue us in under 24 hours and recruit gullible fools to his quixotic quest . 
  portugal was founded a long time before spain and has kept it 's borders , culture and language intact . 
  spain would probably disaggregate long before portugal would . 
  i refuse being called spanish and think the whole idea of uniting with the rest of the peninsula is a dumb and ruinous one . 
  history proves it . 
  you appear to have no historic sense/memory nor a feeling of identity towards the many idiosyncrasies of our unique culture . 
  i also do n't call myself a sueve or a visigoth . 
  slavery was in practice long before portugal even existed . 
  in the north of europe and well in the heart of europe . 
  but those seem to be untouchable and beyond critique to you , perhaps because you see them as better and prefer to remain blinded by hatred towards your own . 
  grow out of it and change your bedroom posters . 
  greeks , carthage , romans , gauls , germans , etc. 
  in the old world all practiced slavery . 
  celts , vikings , muslims also did later on . 
  portugal , spain , holland , britain , flanders , berbers , mongols , turks , egyptians , etc. 
  all took part in the slave trade , which we happened to kick start . 
  they would have done it all the same . 
  to claim we 're guiltier is ridiculous . 
  it 's not like we had better choice back then . 
  should we as country also stop using products of child and other kinds of abusive labor done in asian countries ? 
  we should but good old hypocritical eu turns the blind eye . 
  why ? 
  because it 's pretty much an economical imperative . 
  i can only hope it will be this subreddit 's subject a few centuries from now . 
  i merely pointed that the portuguese had little choice but to accept slaves as payments for dealings with african kingdoms . 
  slavery was already a big problem there long before european came . 
  still , nothing to be proud of but also note the other nations silence towards it . 
  but it 's beyond shameful , yes . 
  agreed . 
  to try and put it in today 's perspective is dishonest . 
  but if you were to travel back in time , you 'd see the succession crisis was indeed seen as a major issue . 
  i wo n't further this any longer . 
  downvote all you want . 
  one would notice that by my wall of text that i went beyond what was asked and began mentioning * dark moments * and not just shameful , effectively going beyond the point of discussion . 
  slavery is horrible but you forget it was common practice even amongst the enslaved . 
  in retrospective , by today 's values , you are correct !, 
  but from an historical point of view , consistency and in regard to the historical success of the empire ( important !!, 
  ) , you 're dead wrong and you argue for a very dull thread . 
  please understand i abhor slavery . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  do n't make this into something it 's not . 
  in retrospective , given the amount of crap all nations did when the world was a much more primitive place , this question would only dwell around murder and brutal oppression . 
  was that the spirit of the question ? 
  that we 'd enumerate pogroms , slavery and rapings ? 
  when at the time , they were common a somewhat universal common practice ? 
  please , do elaborate about who started the whole backstabbing .
