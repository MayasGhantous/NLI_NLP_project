  now , that 's the kind of reply i wanted to attract . 
  inb4 african/south american holocausts . 
  u/ravhin put it quite nicely imho . 
  but thank you for the downvotes . 
  also , as i written above . 
  i agree . 
  we were partly responsible for the african holocaust . 
  but just to put some things in perspective . 
  the african tribes were already doing it to each other quite extensively and quite well . 
  we just exploited that . 
  it was against our christian ethos , and it did cause a lot of stir in portugal , having to be authorized by the catholic pope . 
  historically , the portuguese hardly forced or raided villages into slavery . 
  local tribes did that . 
  the economy they encountered in africa was based upon slaves and kicked into high gear when these african kings and tribes wanted to trade with the portuguese . 
  becoming almost as a currency ( slaves throughout history were very expensive ) . 
  also , the portuguese were among the ones that treated the slaves more humanely . 
  the dutch and spanish were legendary butchers . 
  a reason why the portuguese became powerful , given the small population , was the many treaties , alliances and honoring them . 
  even the slaves knew they had to fight the dutch or suffer much worse fate . 
  we were also among the first to abolish slavery . 
  and converted african natives to christianity , which was in itself a recognition of equality and not of superiority . 
  we also protected many peoples from being enslaved themselves by the turks and other islamic caliphates . 
  our navy defeated and repelled the ottoman empire many times in the iranian and indian coasts .

  portugal . 
  removing kebab since 722 ad !, 
  if it 's any comfort , there are little to no cods left in the wild . 
  everyone lost . 
  i 've been downvoted for saying this . 
  the money is n't aiding anyone but predatory lenders . 
  greece is in economic and social free fall . 
  you can post articles mentioning recovery and exports are rising . 
  but that 's obvious after nearly hitting financial rock bottom . 
  greek society will not return to it 's former level of life , and the eu is inevitably be held responsible for this experiment . 
  the eu is also pushing for a shady privatization and will likely drop greece anyway after it 's picked greece dry . 
  the greek people will have to exist in a country that 's no longer theirs . 
  where water , energy , healthcare and food are overpriced and abusive levels of taxation to support a corrupt government of corporate puppets . 
  that is ... if it does n't slide into a fascist belligerent nation , which either way , will end up filling the same corporations pockets and perhaps even justify more abusive tactics . 
  hands downs the [ portuguese succession crisis of 1580 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_succession_crisis_of_1580 ) . 
  it was downhill ever since . 
  to sum it up a bit : a young , inbred , sexually molested as a child by a priest , and overall extremely pious king , decides to invade alc\u00e1cer-quibir , in what is modern day morocco , to further catholic faith . 
  that stunt created a succession void that allowed spain to legally unite with portugal and with it squander nearly all of portugal 's conquests . 
  fuck everything about our rulers and our noblemen . 
  throughout history , we had but a small hand full of good leaders and the rest were fucking retards being puppeteered by foreign interests . 
  it still is today . 
  they just do n't match the many qualities and cohesion our people have . 
  the pre and post revolution period of 74 was also disastrous . 
  disastrous for the people overseas , who were left without any support and many were slaughtered . 
  also , for the peoples of east timor it spelled indonesian annexation and a 30 year violent and bloody occupation . 
  cape verde and st. tom\u00e9 & principe perhaps should have been kept . 
  the political mess that followed april 's revolution led our country to being robbed from it 's major riches and assets , accumulated over decades of frugality and lack of social investment . 
  an entire political culture arose from that 74 brew that had neither quality nor the interest of the people at heart . 
  also led to successive imf interventions . 
  guess what , we 're still at it . 
  the politicians responsible are still around , and all of them are rich beyond reasonable . 
  but still , i hold [ marcelo caetano ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcelo_caetano ) accountable , for not allowing a peaceful transition to democracy and decolonization , failing to seize the self-presented opportunity following [ salazar 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_de_oliveira_salazar ) death . 
  some dark moments in portugal 's history are : the [ 1755 earthquake ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_lisbon_earthquake ) , as a serious blow to the people and the [ empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_empire ) and removed lisbon from it 's european relevance ; the [ royal family escape to brazil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transfer_of_the_portuguese_court_to_brazil ) , during the [ peninsular wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) and [ napoleonic invasions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_wars ) . 
  when we returned the favor and took madrid , perhaps we should have razed it . 
  spain 's backstabbing has been a constant and is greatly imbued in popular culture . 
  we like the spanish people very much , we just do n't trust their leaders intentions . 
  i do n't think we trust ours as well ... '' * de espanha , nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos * '' which translates as '' * from spain comes neither good winds/omens nor good unions * '', 
  i bet giant alien lizards are behind this . 
  there is a serious genetic trade-off . 
  so , it 's not all roses . 
  portuguese are chronically depressed and apathetic towards everything . 
  it 's true . 
  as long as [ oliven\u00e7a ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza ) is under spanish control , they have no moral high ground to lay any claim to gibraltar . 
  it 's a must here in the concentration camp . 
  but still a lot more than the natives . 
  at least it 's not our police . 
  those would be excellent in teaching on how to infiltrate demonstrators , provoke for a violent response and then how to beat up old ladies and small children . 
  just when you think it ca n't go any lower ... how do these people manage politics when they seem the type that ca n't even tie their own shoes ? 
  whoever argues against this new reality is ridiculed or put under the spotlight . 
  even if given voice by a few media , it has no impact in policies . 
  the overclass has realized that there is no more need for subtleties . 
  they know that the population is past the point it could live without consumerism or loans . 
  they know the balance of power is in their favor . 
  they went straight to the policy makers - the ruling parties , bypassing the general public opinion . 
  given they already control the majority of the media , there are now very truncated options being presented . 
  whoever we vote makes little difference , from my experience and perspective . 
  no new party can arise from nothing . 
  no new leader can rise without this kind of support . 
  everything is contaminated .
