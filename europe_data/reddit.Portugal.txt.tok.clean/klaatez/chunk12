   so what do they do ? 
  heard on national tv here that he is on a psiquiatric hospital, 
  there is a battle in ww1 that they also did that , they charged in battalion formation ( just like the napolionic wars ) a german machine gun nest , needless to say that a few germans caused thousand of french deaths . 
  no , we like them , they helped us against the spanish and the french , vote pro-genoese !, 
  wut , we did nothing we 're just traders , we buy in one place and sell it in other place , doesnt matter the cargo ! / s, 
   2 * a direct result of free market capitalism . 
  the brits blocked the irish ports to us food import , that doesnt sound free to me . 
  we dont say putin enough ... putin putin putin, 
  lusitania was a roman province in the portuguese region, 
  thank you, 
   we alone need to grow 5 % to keep the unemployment rate stable . 
  actually most economists say that you need 2 % growth to create jobs, 
  where is cap verde ? 
  [ that and maybe a trade of eez between spain and portugal ] ( http://zap.aeiou.pt/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/f78947724005f5d5cc93e3d5f22a2a98-560x450.png ), 
  [ he also offered one to our dictator !, 
  ] ( http://cdn.sabado.pt/2015-03/img_999x556$2015_03_18_16_56_24_113492.jpg ) what a nice guy, 
  most sources put the number of killed between 40-60 million , i did the average . 
  and also , he had more than `` his population '' to work with .

  privatization isnt capitalism wtf . 
  of course the man that was for a germany economy that could stand isolated , that spoke against loaning from american banks and said `` we are socialists , we are enemies of today 's capitalistic economic system '' is capitalist . 
  this post is so retarded i dont know where to start , so i am just leaving a small note here . 
  capitalism = / = imperialism . 
  edit : 100 million indigenous people ? 
  holy fuck did europe wipe out all life forms from the americas and africa and let them `` regrow '' so they could genocide them again ? 
  you are really good pulling things out your arse . 
  edit2 :  nazi terror/concentration & extermination camps 1939-45 : 25 million hitler was a capitalist . 
  edit3 :  el salvador military dictatorship 1977-92 : 70,000 dictatorships are also capitalist , the more you learn . 
  edit4 :  angola civil war 1974-92 : 500,000  mozambique civil war 1975-90 : 1 million pretty sure those communist are more to blame for those . 
  you may please try to remove your head from your anus , the shit is starting to leak from places it shouldnt . 
  just a little stat : stalin 5 milion in the holomodor only ( its enough to leave the capitalists behind ) and 50 milion in total . 
  mao killed 60 milion +, 
   in fact while were at it let 's ban all capitalist symbols since far more have died under capitalist regimes . 
  stalin is now rolling on his grave thinking he killed more people alone than all the capitalist regimes since their beginning and the next 500 years . 
  except turkey,

  it still can be abused as easly as online voting . 
  well , eu4 + vic2 helped me do [ 1:18 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2ykxz9j.png ) also, 
  a decent suburb , we didnt had territorial organization until a few decades ago which means that every fucking house is build on the side of the road , there is no space for sidewalk , most of our roads are really narrow and a city with 100k pop has severe transit problems . 
   e-voting that a no , no , no , no , no , no . 
  when e-voting comes around , democracy is dead edit : for all of you asking , [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi ) covers almost all points . 
  [ tremo\u00c7os ] ( http://aldeia-de-gralhas.typepad.fr/.a/6a00e00994b3e98833017d3f7b910e970c-pi ) or [ moelas ] ( http://www.chefslittlehelper.com/sites/default/files/userpics_public/moelas.jpg ), 
  you dont talk the real lingua franca : cabe\u00e7a , a\u00e7ucar , cacha\u00e7a ... 
  the problem is , its expensive , people dont care enough to know what they are voting for and the consequences, 
  the latest portuguese start ups either were sold to big american companies , or moved to america themselves to get better access to funding . 
  if spain is vulnerable we are vulnerable , our 3 main rivers come from spain if the cut us our water supply we are fucked, 
  it would be 1904 all over again , but worst, 
  exposed fiber cables would be good also, 
  so you are the bastards that post the youtube videos called `` portuguese arent white !, 
  watch these examples '', 
  yeah i agree , kicking the spanish ass isnt much to be proud off : /, 
  nothing about discoveries or kicking the spanish ass with 5:1 odds ? 
  disapointed, 
  a10 is too easy to shot down, 
  thats the spanish republic , the iberian federation flag is [ this ] ( http://www.oocities.org/capitolhill/lobby/9118/atelier/fict/fdib1.gif ), 
   he was n't accused of anything he was, 
  subtitles available in 18 languages . 
  check out , sob :(, 
   yeah but gypsies usually get the blame for every form of small petty crime and general sense of insecurity in big cities . 
  it will be pretty funny the day i see a gipsy get blamed for macro economic issues . 
  correio da manha : `` socrates blames gypsies for having to call troika '', 
   ( have never been in power but apparently dominate our policy and culture and are literally dictators ) they control the biggest union and use them to push their agenda ... you also forgot the gypsies . 
  haha , our colonies are of homogay , or atleast abstained . 
  disapointed with cap verde though . 
  parents have more to do . 
  so thats how top gear drove around there . 
  if you arent pro-eu , vote for someone anti-eu, 
  nop , we were literally removed from the map ... 
  we lost our chances at it in the battle of nuremberg ... 
  its translated below ... what do you mean not everyone understands portugues ? 
  your country is so small that roads arent that much deteriorating on the end result . 
  yep , there was a roman , i think , philosopher that said that a good war was better that a bad peace , and you can see it happen all the time , ww1 treaty , the punic wars , molova , a case were a bad peace made a ever worse war or just shitty living conditions, 
  i just imagine in the last hours of a mad the british nuking the french just so they go to shit first . 
   bad peace is always better than good war . 
  i think i prefer the old roman version , the exact opposite . 
  where the fuck you think you are ? 
  wherever it is pick a damm side !, 
  you are in the internet things here are black and white so you either right or wrong !, 
  stop running away from my ally , france !, 
  no dota2 or world of tanks ? 
  zurfer75 confirmed not russian !, 
  only 1 more occupation to peace deal ... 
   imagine the cigarette smuggling between moldova and romania !, 
  gibaltrar -  spain and portugal might top that in number of units . 
   they have trade agreements with the eu already . 
  if they join the eu they will lose an industry that employs thousands and gain nothing . 
  if they continue their fishing practices the same will happen , but it will be a lot worse, 
   would be giving tge rebels an airforce rebels cant fly modern aircraft ... 
   bektashi order never heard of that , where does it come from ? 
  they have a huge nuclear arsenal , so that makes them a nuclear super power, 
  in portugal we call it estores , but persianas mean the same as in italian . 
  if you cant kill it , you shouldnt eat it !, 
  they are not legal ... and leaving cristal meth legal , well that would be productive, 
  that is total energy ( transportation , electricity , etc. 
  ) , we hit 64 % on electricity only , and thats what is pretty much carrying us around . 
  ou ao contrario :p, 
  hon jaja ha hon, 
  you can see the portuguese colony of luxembourg if you look closly . 
  `` any day now ... any day . . '', 
  hydro is renewable so its still quite a lot .
