  what i mean is that a fingerprint should be an identification method , not taken as proof of anything . 
  your username identifies you , so does your passport and fingerprint . 
  just because a passport includes a fingerprint and a photo that matches the person presenting it at a border ( for example ) , does n't mean that / u/ajaume is trying to cross said border . 
  no , not proof . 
  identification . 
  so it 's a good form of identification , a pessimal form of authentication/authorization and non-repudiation ? 
  bad idea ; salaries there are both small * and * far away . 
  ca n't say about the czech republic , but in portugal it 's easy to walk up to a bar and get drugs , as long as they 're either alcohol or tobacco . 
  re : other drugs , enforcement is strict , as you wo n't get away anonymously or just paying a fine . 
  hey , our portuguese eid ~ ~ was copied ~ ~ is similar to belgium 's , from what little i know . 
  uh , what ? 
  basic biometrics ( not including a physical fingerprint [ 0 ] ) such as height and age and who 're your parents , a bunch of id numbers ; also your address , provided you allow it ( via a pin ) . 
  the id numbers [ 1 ] will allow them to look your information up in their systems ( hence `` limits of their working department '' makes sense ) , but that other data is not stored in the card . 
  [ 0 ] : having this in our old paper ids was so quaint . 
  [ 1 ] : tax id number , citizen id number and social security number .

  the full article you point to quotes reuters , like i did . 
  the article ** you ** linked right above says `` cheap loans '' which kinda contradicts ** your ** 10-30 % concept . 
  you 're trolling . 
  no point . 
  i had this idea that you nlers had a different approach to life ; was kinda hoping you 'd expand on that . 
  let me replace `` abuse of power '' for `` abuse of trust '' ; i should use the first for public office position , not for your `` big cheese of large company '' example .

  oh boy ... a bunch of banks made bad credit risk assessments , using money they raised through posting bonds . 
  mostly , foreign entities slurped them all up . 
  when the property bubble got popped , these banks got bailed out by the government and now the whole country is suffering austerity measures to pay that guarantee . 
  that 's corruption . 
  why does a bondholder deserve a government backed guarantee for what is , in all fairness , a private stock exchange ? 
  wan na bet the people who are now paying and suffering would not carry a referendum for that guarantee ? 
  and more importantly , why bail out one bank and not another ? 
  you described robbing and abuse of power . 
  banking crisis ? 
  best to try and find out why those banks had a crisis .

  anyone care to expand on the detail that one of the persons working on this law ( i thought it was n't approved yet ) had an employment relationship with the agency that 's going to benefit from the law ?

  hey , 't was memorial day yesterday . 
  too bad they ended up electing bush jr. , and the dream ended ?

  a portuguese and a finn carpool into work at nokia . 
  the finn 's the senior employee , mentoring the portuguese guy . 
  when arriving in the morning , earlier than usual , the finn parks right by the campus exit , farthest from the door . 
  the portuguese says : - `` hey , we got in so early -- why do n't you park over there by our building 's entrance ?!, 
  i do n't want to walk all the way to the door , in the snow , uphill both ways ... '' - `` yeah , but we 're early . 
  our friends who 'll arrive later might need to park in a hurry ; we can go and walk a bit . 
  bring your umbrella . 
  '' , replied the finn . 
  the portuguese was enlightened . 
  it 's the same as the belgian eid thingy . 
  i see how the euro benefits germany 's export-oriented small and medium enterprises -- we have a lot of german-sourced technology here . 
  dutch ? 
  finnish ? 
  sorry , i do n't follow . 
  more money will be spent -- where will it come from , and why would someone expect to get a return on it from portugal ? 
  [ syriza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_of_the_radical_left ) is a whole party , not just one sole idiot . 
  my friends and family are not so interested in politics as well -- but everyone 's affected by political shenanigans . 
  it 's great if you can maintain your interest in how the world runs . 
  and english is n't my first language -- that sure does n't help . 
  `` grey '' is how some describe the portuguese outlook on life . 
  ever been here ? 
  funny how you if ask someone `` what 's up ? '', 
  you get `` meh '' 9/10 . 
  compare to italians : every one 's cool , happy , smiling [ and go `` ciao !, 
  '' ] ( http://youtu.be/-pmuhwpzsky?t=5s ) . 
  [ deleted ] mate , how ` bout i ask you what 's `` the craic '' -- instead of throwing out lame jokes about `` tipsy '' and `` craic '' , eh ? 
  at least i ( eventually ... ) got some sense . 
  take syriza 's election platform : '' * we do n't care , we wo n't pay . 
  let the rest of the eu pay !, 
  * '' money sources are very scarce at the moment ; not-so-funny acronyms like gipsis and piigs have lumped us all together . 
  it 's not surprising that ireland 's noonan and portugal 's gaspar are thoroughly distancing themselves from syriza 's irresponsible behavior .
