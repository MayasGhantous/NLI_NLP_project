the regional government of the azores tries to promote azorean meat as a higher quality product , their logic is that the cows stay in the fields all year around in the lower altitude fields in winter and in the higher ones in the summer and only eat fresh grass ( they also say that the animals are happier but i do n't think there is any valid study that can confirm that ) , there is also a `` quality stamp '' that usually identifies the origin and is used in meat and dairy products . 
  i know that in the region those products are considered to have better quality , but i do n't really know how wide spread this ideia is in mainland portugal .

  what do you think the red in our flag stands for ? 
  :-) never had one , but my 1st car was a mehari plage , and it was a very fun car to drive even if you had to push him every day in winter for him to start , but that was the price my friends had to pay if they wanted a ride to school .

  people usually come to the azores to go whale watching , communing with nature and all that shit , but it is always funny when they get to s. miguel and discover that thanks to a public art festival they can find over 120 gratifies and other pieces in the streets of ponta delgada and other villages around the island .

  in portugal : indian sumer  ver\u00e3o de s\u00e3o martinho milky way  via l\u00e1ctea the sunshower  do n't know if there is an expression for this , my grandmother used to say that `` the witches are getting married '' ... but this year until last week we had a very rainy summer so two people said to me in different ocasions that we are having a `` nordic summer '' , 
  true , call me naive but when i look at things like same sex marriage laws ( even if we are still missing adoption ) , drug decriminalisation , and a somewhat successful immigration policy and i ca n't but feel a little proud for my country . 
  it fills my hearth to know that our government is making an effort to make us go visit other countries !, 
  right on , in fact it was predicted that it will be in a foggy morning that [ d. sebastian i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sebastian_of_portugal ) will return to save portugal ( he should be here any moment now ) . 
   the austerity program was counter-productive and contracted the economy more than productive gains  in order , for ireland to pay even the interest they need a consistent government surplus of 5.6 % of gdp for 10-15 years to get the debt to 60 % . 
  these levels are virtually impossible . 
  you could change some names in your comment and the same would be true for portugal,

  an anecdotal evidence : while not young ( 41 and 42 ) my partner and i , we are looking for work abroad , in fact he is going thursday to london for 2 interviews . 
  for the last 10 years we both had a small company doing graphic design and programming , we had some nice clients and some monthly fees that allowed us to have a somewhat confortable life , even if we never had a huge amount of money to spend . 
  in the last year around 85 % of our small clients closed their business and the big ones merged their portuguese offices with the spanish ones , lefting us with not enough income to pay for all the taxes that our business had to pay , so we had to close . 
  i know a lot of people that used to work in architecture or design jobs that are facing the same situation , and the only solution we have , is to go fing a job somewhere where our talents are needed and we are payed accordingly with our skills and experience , the portuguese marked is this areas is full and the companies use a lot of unpaid interns fresh from college . 
  also because we both were the owners of the company we dont receive any kind benefits for being unemployed . 
  and for the `` not so fast '' chases we have this [ ones ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/segway_policia_in_lisboa.jpg/577px-segway_policia_in_lisboa.jpg ) . 
  i think one solution would be that if you are found guilty of corruption while working in a government or public service or dealing with tax payers money , you should get also a `` can not work in any public or government service , be involved in any transaction that deals with public funds and can not hold an elected position in government etc. '', 
  for at least 20 years , besides the regular sentence . 
  :-) he tried to use the coat of arms of ordem de s. miguel da ala , had to pay a fine because of it and was told `` mr. duarte de bragan\u00e7a should consign himself to be an ordinary citizen , respect the republic and realize that he is not , nor will be , king of portugal '' *** burn ***, 
  i could not find a name for it except '' the moorish invasion of 172-175 a.d. '' this ofc was much earlier than the 711 a.d islamic invasion that conquered the entire iberian peninsula ( except for galicia and asturias in the far north ) from the byzantines and the visigoths . 
  ours acts and talks like he could be a poster boy to warn against the perils of inbreeding . 
  he also marched against the proposal for same-sex marriage with the far-right and the catholic church , and that is a big no-no in my opinion . 
  would love a `` amazing animals of europe '' , can we have this please ? 
  ** iberia ** more or less at 100 a.d. trajan and later hadrian happened , at the time iberia was calm and sunny , but then the moors around 185 a.d. started to look at us from the north of africa and similar to an horde of uk tourists in the peak of summer they invaded the south of the peninsula , ( unlike the northern invaders they were less prone to solar insolation and did not get shit-faced before 8.00 pm ) .

  no c\u00fa de judas - in judas ass, 
  you are right , ofc . 
  that definition must include the cork export industry since we are the biggest producer in the world . 
  so true , as a gay man myself i am very proud to say that i never had the feeling that i was being discriminated in portugal . 
  i know that is not the case for everyone , especially if you are not living in lisbon or other main city or maybe i am just lucky . 
  there you go , sorry about the quality , the original was pure shit in resolution and content  [ 2 conchas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fonjni5.jpg ) i am also sure they do n't have permission from the photo authors to used them so a copyright infringement would be funny  and donate the financial compensation from it to some lgbt group in hungary .

  to be honest we would not want them any other way , from who else would we get our strawberry flavoured nesquik , our pez dispensers and the garish polyester shirts to use in the 70 's theme parties ? 
  i know some people that returned from the usa to the azores thinking that their retirement in usa dollars would be a lot of money in portugal , they forgot that we use the euro now and things are not as cheap for them as they used to be , it is not bad but , it is not that much either , in the other hand they are amazed how cheap our national healthcare services are , and make extensive use of them . 
  azoreans dont think bad of them in any way , we just think they are a bit tacky , and without much taste .

  why is this even a story ? 
  i really dont understand why we have to know details about his private life !, 
  i dont know about the rest of the countries in southern europe , but in portugal the forested area is increasing every year , and has been for some time now . 
  lisbon  portugal cost : 40 $ + 23 % iva download : 100mbps ( no limits to uploading or downloading ) the package includes + / - 150 tv channels + free phone to any national number , does not includes calls to mobile numbers, 
  any country where i would feel that my family ( gay couple for 13 years ) is at least as respected as in my own country and have the same rights , and where our knowledge and hard work would be valued . 
  in fact we are thinking of moving to northern europe or australia/new zealand . 
  i am sad o say that the main reason is that after 20 years seeing my country evolve and become a place that i was proud off , and after almost 10 years trying to build a successful business , i think we have in the last years `` devolve '' into a place where only those with political connections can progress .

  bullfight by rope is a tradicional tradition in the azores ( portugal ) . 
  the bulls are released usually in the village streets , fishing ports or at the local beach , they are tied to a 500 mts rope held by 6 men everyone can try to engage the bull , after the bullfight the animals return to the pastures and can only be used again after a 15 day period rest .

  ** aristides de sousa mendes **  was a portuguese diplomat . 
  he ignored and defied the orders of his own government for the safety of war refugees fleeing from invading german military forces in the early years of world war ii . 
  between june 16 and june 23 , 1940 , he frantically issued portuguese visas free of charge , to over 30,000 refugees seeking to escape the nazi terror , 12,000 of whom were jews . 
  we are petty , we never value what is ours , everything we do must have a flaw somewhere . 
  in what criteria ? 
  spain has a greater gdp than portugal , they have won more eurovision contests than portugal , and ilga-europe gives spain a higher ranking regarding lgbt rights than it gives to portugal , so at least in this 3 `` subjects '' spain is better than portugal , on the other hand portugal population is more fluent in english than the spanish one , our drug policy is more sensible and in my personal experience our beer tastes better !, 
  we also have so much in common , we both are invaded in the summer by hordes of drunken chavs , we have the best looking lynx in the world , our food and wine culture is amazing etc. 
  of course you can have you our opinion about what country you like more or where would you prefer to live , but to say that one is better than the other is in my opinion just dumb .
