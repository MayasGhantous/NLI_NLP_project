  just grab belgium by the pussy . 
   come to think of it , is it any wonder i left the uk ? 
  not really . 
  the weather alone justifies it . 
  in all seriousness , bullying exists everywhere . 
  you too ?!, 
  dam , we should make a club or something . 
  also he 's way out her league , looks wise . 
  pretty unusual . 
  that is so many levels of clusterfuck ... 
  we already provided refuge to a few thousands during wwii in madeira . 
  it 's the least they can do to thank us . 
  better start saving those pounds to spend in europe this next summer . 
  parity will be a bitch !, 
   he went to school to become a drama teacher , and when that did n't work out settled for being a ski instructor you really ca n't make this shit up ...  he won the election because people were tired of the conservatives and the fact that he is the son of a famous pm . 
  and attractive . 
  you forgot that . 
   but we do n't do that anymore . 
  since 1977 . 
  in 1981 it was abolished . 
  france was the last western european country to abolish the death penalty . 
  plenty of people here probably still remember those times . 
   we 're off to a rough start but i 'm confident time will help . 
  if christianity 's history shows anything is that only blood will do . 
  you being french should know that better than most . 
   maybe i misunderstood that but why do you need a special law for that ? 
   vandalizing a temple should be just as punishabe as vandalizing any private property . 
  exactly !, 
  we have laws for defamation , libel and destruction of property , but mix religion and all of a sudden it 's a different crime . 
   and has separation of state and church de jure , yes , de facto no . 
  portugal has a concordat signed with the vatican that gives a whole bunch of privileges to the catholic church and no other denomination . 
  we have judges going to the papers saying that they see themselves as implementing god 's will on earth . 
  judges with very high profile cases . 
  it 's borderline insane . 
  that is the crux . 
  how the hell can you mock religion without insulting the people that profess it ? 
  even just mildly criticizing it is tricky since everything will be perceived as an insult . 
   and then again , even the portuguese law forbade blasphemy it would be no impediment for me to share this link . 
  never said it was . 
  i say that what that guy did is a crime in portugal . 
  most likely it would not get prosecuted though . 
  i wish they came to the iberian peninsula . 
  prices are ridiculous here and there certainly is demand . 
     i dunno , it really seems that us euros pretend to be morally superior to everyone else . 
  it is but a smokescreen . 
  the carlie hebdo was hilarious in here . 
  all the `` i am charlie '' and what they did was a crime punishable here up to 1 year in prison . 
  you may find hilarious what you wish , the fact remains , insulting a religion insults the practitioners and is a crime . 
  i used them 20 eur from stockholm to copenhagen . 
  bought < 24 hours before departure . 
  could n't believe it . 
  buses were decent . 
  for comparison , buying madrid -  lisbon 1 week in advance was almost 40 eur . 
  not a great deal . 
  5 trips max . 
  i made one with this company 3 month ago . 
  bought the day before for approx 20eur . 
  this is not good value for money . 
  might juts as well buy the regular tickets, 
  like guterres he is nothing but a coward . 
  wtf is soares doing there ? 
  he never gained international recognition . 
  sad thing is guterres is the least bad of this bunch . 
  talk about placing the bar really low ... 
  you 're saying that to people that have discussions on whether the tea should be placed into the hot water or the hot water over the tea . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  any examples ? 
  british people ca n't cook !, 
  stop forcing your suckage on other people !, 
  the bike owner ? 
   it s like a time machine , go before it s too late . 
  got told this 3 years ago . 
  a shame i got sick in thailand . 
  next time it 'll probably be too late ... 
  they fixed his back . 
  great healthcare there . 
  you really get your money 's worth ... 
  he 's blander than water . 
  we 're talking pc overload . 
  no awkward questions . 
  maybe that 's why the election happened in such a short period of time . 
  if she 's a female weightlifter from the 1980 's you can check so many check boxes ... 
  near viseu it 's geologicaly very stable , but i get your point . 
   nope , maybe other people know but i had no idea ( and ** i study linguistics ** , go figure . ), 
  wtff ? 
   probably the most linguistically ignorant people in ~ ~ europe ~ ~ the world . 
  fixed it for you . 
  perfidious albion in action . 
  nothing new here . 
  move along . 
  what 's new ? 
  from maoist to goldman 's lackey . 
  he 's sure come a long way . 
  what do you do for a living ? 
  not even to first base . 
  people that think this is not already taking place are na\u00efve beyond belief . 
   funnily enough portugal is the only european country to have ** had at one point in time ** their capital in the americas, 
  [ what could go wrong ?

  for that price you can get someone to do the entire deed for you .
