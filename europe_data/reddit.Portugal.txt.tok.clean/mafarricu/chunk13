   can we open a detention centre in the middle of the sahara and deport these ignorant fucknuts out there permanently ?

  though not a primary source , the information is correct :  the five real nobel prizes -- physics , chemistry , literature , peace , and medicine/physiology -- were set up in the will left by the dynamite magnate when he died in 1895 . 
  the economics prize is a bit different . 
  it was created by sweden 's central bank in 1969 , nearly 75 years later . 
  the award 's real name is the `` sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel . '' it was not established by nobel , but supposedly in memory of nobel . 
  it 's a ruse and a pr trick , and i mean that literally . 
  and it was done completely against the wishes of the nobel family . 
   and proposed building a wall around switzerland nature took care of that . 
  usually only if you are male . 
  there is no nobel prize in economics . 
  i guess you do n't travel much .
