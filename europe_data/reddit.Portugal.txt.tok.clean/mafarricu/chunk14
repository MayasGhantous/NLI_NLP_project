  lawful or not . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  the gay of the village made an enemy . 
   we all know where . 
  i do n't . 
  where ? 
  the bottom one . 
  more fat people ... 
  i can understand not taking action out of fear . 
  but do n't bullshit me saying you did n't know anything when you were goebbels secretary . 
  it 's insulting . 
   this is a hugely important point actually . 
  it 's almost impossible for those of us born in the 2nd half of the 20th century or later to comprehend how incredibly unusual our ability to get informed about things really is . 
  if you think doing something like this is harder now instead of much easier you do n't live in reality . 
   it was only when she returned home that she became aware of the holocaust , she insists , referring to it as `` the matter of the jews '' . 
  * the matter of the jews * . 
  talk about a ~ ~ n ~ ~ euphemism . 
   she quickly resumed a life not dissimilar to the one she had had , when she found secretarial work at the state broadcaster once again , working her way up to become the executive secretary to its director of programmes and enjoying a privileged life of well-paid work and travel before retiring , aged 60 , in 1971 . 
  basically she was an accomplice and suffered nothing but 5 years at a ussr prison camp ( clearly not in very bad conditions otherwise she would n't have made it to 105 )  but it would take her a full six decades after the end of the war before she made any inquiries about her jewish schoolfriend , eva . 
  when the holocaust memorial was unveiled in 2005 , she took a trip from her home in munich to see it for herself . 
  some friend that does n't even care for her fate for 60 fucking years !, 
   those people nowadays who say they would have stood up against the nazis -- i believe they are sincere in meaning that , but believe me , most of them would n't have . 
   after the rise of the nazi party , `` the whole country was as if under a kind of a spell , '' she insists . 
  it always amuses me that after a major societal disruption no one was ever part of the old order . 
  everyone was oblivious . 
  you 'd believe the stasi was a mom and pop operation in some backwater small eastern germany town . 
  no one was an informer , no one worked for them . 
  it 's like it ran with ai entities in the xx century . 
  the few that admit to have had anything to do with the old order were always mindless paper pushing drones ( like the excuse in this case ) . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  good thing the core of the interview did n't elude you . 
  i think by definition ideologies must be unrealistic . 
  america could easily win over europe in any war and i 'm possibly including russia . 
  it sucks but power makes the rules . 
  to think otherwise is almost deluded . 
  those are fictions . 
  why should they take any risks ? 
  you can rest assured , if any of those people were brought to justice it would be a major diplomatic/military incident . 
  eesti can into free world . 
   i really really really dislike her why ? 
  first time i 've heard of her . 
  you just need time , health and money . 
  all the rest is optional and many times superfluous . 
   it 's a fantastic area if you enjoy hiking , cycling and/or outdoor stuff . 
  and crappy weather ... 
  the problem lies in bullshit like diplomatic immunity which de jure and de facto is total impunity according to the law and also with diplomatic suitcases which are used for everything from trafficking drugs and diamonds to kiddy porn . 
  i understand that you personally benefited from this so objectivity is not your goal here , but facts do n't change . 
   additionally , your home country can persecute you for the crime you committed they * may * prosecute you , but are under no obligation legal or otherwise of doing so . 
  and child porn in their diplomatic suitcases ( another great concept ), 
    there literally are no legal consequences for people with diplomatic immunity . 
   this is wrong . 
  you can go to jail even if you have diplomatic immunity , just not in your host country . 
  once you identify yourself and prove immunity you ca n't as this case clearly shows . 
  you either do n't know what you 're talking about or are a liar . 
  as far as the law is concerned , these people are effectively gods . 
  got a reference for that ? 
  if true it 's ** highly ** unusual . 
   anyone knows what would happen if someone were to kill someone with diplomatic immunity ? 
  legally it 's `` just '' homicide . 
  probably the harshest sentence . 
  in practice , i would n't be surprised in many circumstances if the perpetrator was just killed by it 's own home-country in some extrajudicial execution . 
  i really would n't , depending on the countries involved . 
  what were you expecting , them calling for an ambulance ? 
  like seriously ? 
  i 'm surprised the kid was n't doa . 
  i think the demigods probably thought he was and just messed up . 
   this is actually a thing that happens with diplomats or relatives commiting crimes , their countries do give them up for trial if they do n't believe that this is a set-up it might happen but i do n't think it 's the usual route ... 
   what about murder and rape ? 
  any and every crime . 
  no exceptions . 
  i 'm not even joking . 
  but that 's different because he was weak . 
  the usa has more military power than ** everyone else combined ** . 
  all the rest is empty talk . 
  why are you sure ? 
  i 'd reckon they do n't give a flying fuck at least when it 's related to portugal .

  kamelouse would be worse , 
  and sobriety . 
  anti-netherlands ? 
  once in lisbon i saw a taxi driver and a very young guy driving a car with a diplomatic license plate arguing loudly over who had right of way ( i have no idea who was right ) . 
  all i could think was that the taxi driver was suicidal . 
  the other guy could just get out and downright shoot him in broad daylight and nothing would happen to him . 
  people think this is exaggeration but it 's the actual reality . 
  there literally are no legal consequences for people with diplomatic immunity . 
  yes . 
  political immunity . 
  maybe others but i ca n't think of any right now . 
  that 's another league . 
  holly fuck !, 
  how long ago ? 
  russia is right there , ready for the plunder . 
  plus i 'm sure you can just conscript santa claus , a major asset . 
  he 's in rovaniemi , last time i heard . 
   everyone has hopes and desires . 
  and other people do n't have to acquiesce to them . 
  is that the one near the bus station ?
