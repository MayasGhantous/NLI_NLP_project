  then again , i ca n't control every person that reads this . 
   that seems like a lot of trouble since iraq probably is n't going to allow this to go without consequences as you imply . 
  they might put on a show , but nothing of substance will come out of this . 
  i 'd bet good money on it . 
  i think once it happened with multiple shots . 
  the suicidal guy was really determined . 
  another one was just decapitated postmortem . 
  no details on that news . 
  it seems likely . 
  either that or a very hard object ( brick , steel bar , etc ) . 
  [ it 's just been revoked ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwc_iay3bmy ), 
  yes , but i do n't think they can even make him . 
  or is this a possibility ? 
  i 've read huge chunks of the vienna convention but it was more than a decade ago . 
  why the fuck does ~ ~ diplomatic ~ ~ immunity exist ? 
  there , i fixed it for you . 
  because the law is equal for everyone but some are more equal than others . 
  sometimes people in custody even manage to commit suicide with the officers gun while handcuffed behind their backs . 
  it has happened in the past . 
   nothing could be done . 
  2nd amendment might disagree ... 
  it 's different when he does it . 
   even if there is no current ambassador to iraq it still [ there is an honorary consul  ( http://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/ministerios/mne/quero-saber-mais/sobre-o-ministerio/representacoes-diplomaticas-portuguesas/embaixadas-e-postos-consulares.aspx#i ) the actual ambassador is in abu dhabi iraque ( rep\u00fablica do ) embaixador extraordin\u00e1rio e plenipotenci\u00e1rio : o embaixador em abu dhabi consulado honor\u00e1rio em erbil endere\u00e7o : mosul road , baz roundabout erbil - iraque telefone : + ( 964 ) 66\u00a0264\u00a04987 c\u00f4nsul honor\u00e1rio : anwer tahir mahmood dizayee dependente da sec\u00e7\u00e3o consular em abu dahbi, 
  translation : attackers of teenage boy are sons of irak 's ambassador to portugal two iraqi brothers , 17 years of age , where released from custody today after having been detained by the police for the brutal attack on a 15 year old boy . 
  they have diplomatic immunity . 
  the two alleged attackers of a 15 year old boy in ponte de sor ( portalegre district ) where released today after the police confirmed that they have a diplomatic passport and have diplomatic immunity on the account of being children of the iraqi ambassador to portugal . 
  dn ( the newspaper ) confirmed with a judicial source that the two youngsters will not be interrogated officially in criminal proceedings due to having diplomatic immunity since it is extended to all of the ambassador 's family members . 
  the boy attacked on wednesday in a brawl suffered multiple fractures and underwent facial reconstruction surgery at the hospital santa maria in lisbon . 
  he also suffered a head injury and is in an induced coma in intensive care . 
  the public relations officer of the territorial command of portalegre , jos\u00e9 mois\u00e9s reported that the authorities registered an altercation between the victim and the alleged assailants next to a bar at night in that city in alentejo . 
  later , according to the official , the two young men assaulted the victim on avenida da liberdade , in the heart of ponte de sor . 
  the 15-year-old boy , was later found unconscious by municipal workers who collect the garbage , was assisted at the health center of ponte de sor , but had to be transported by helicopter to the hospital of santa maria in lisbon . 
  context : ponte de sor is quite far away from lisbon . 
  this was nowhere near a large urban center . 
  some 5 to 10 years ago a car with a consulate license plate ran over a cop at a traffic stop in downtown lisbon and just ran away . 
  the cop eventually died shortly after . 
  nothing came of it . 
  when people tell you that the law is the same for everyone and everyone is identical according to the law , you can always say that 's false because diplomatic immunity allows a special caste of humans to kill someone in cold blood on national live tv while legally not being able to suffer ** any ** consequences . 
  it 's bullshit . 
   but diplomatic immunity exists for a good reason . 
  and that reason is ? 
  non religious fast to fix what the religious fast was supposed to help with . 
   abhorrent abomination as opposed to what , a not abhorrent abomination ? 
  totally open to it , but : it 's far away and scandinavia is way too expensive for me ( i 've been to developed places that are also a bit expensive and far more interesting ) this is the opinion of a guy that was passing by . 
  totally subjective and possibly unfounded . 
  do n't take it too hard . 
  i 've been to many places and very few turned out radically different from my very first impression though . 
  i just passed by and it looked ** so ** different from stockholm ( departure ) . 
  i was really impressed by how different it looked . 
  it gave me a very bad vibe . 
  it 's not objective , but i was glad i did n't spend much time there ... stockholm was gorgeous . 
  beautiful city . 
  copenhagen was ok . 
  i laughed . 
   yet in the u.s , its just another ** slow ** saturday, 
   grenade attacks what ?!, 
  i was there recently on my way to copenhagen . 
  the place looked like a shit-hole . 
  i was really taken aback by the contrast with both stockholm and copenhagen . 
  yeah , i know that feeling . 
   poland also have very low prices for food and rent food , yes , rent and house prices , not really that cheap . 
   there is nothing but contempt and hate for us soldiers in wwii . 
  come on !, 
  there plenty of monuments tanking the usa soldiers . 
  even in france . 
   100 most popular korean dramas ( part 2 ) holly fuck . 
  top 100 !, 
  it 's worse than porn . 
   there were times in my life where i 'd rather have been killed it 's well within your reach to fix that terrible injustice . 
  the dead guy ca n't resurrect himself . 
   no one 's ever survived being murdered . 
   could n't resist ... 
  is that you , hillary ? 
   living like god in france i 'll take living like god anywhere . 
  all-powerful and all . 
  are children allowed ? 
  because for north americans that would probably cross the criminal line . 
  not much frankly . 
  he is a coward that took the country one step closer to bankruptcy by creating all kinds of bogus social programs that benefited his voters . 
  when the consequences of his actions became inescapable he bailed out like the little coward that he is by resigning . 
  he also had some minor fraud scandals regarding his time at university ( like grading student 's work that was never actually delivered ) . 
  i find it deliciously ironic that he might not be elected on the gender card because he was a white-knight to the extreme as a prime minister . 
  a taste of his own sexist medicine would do him good . 
  as for qualities , at least he is n't dur\u00e3o barroso , i guess that is something . 
  for a solo traveller it 's usually too expensive . 
  plus , you get no guarantee if the property owner cancels and short term booking ( like i usually do ) is problematic to say the least . 
  glad to know it worked out for you . 
  the greece of the usa .

   and if you do n't mind the german spa experience what 's there to mind ? 
  what are the idiosyncrasies ? 
  i suppose you go naked but also mixed gender . 
  is this right ? 
  have n't been there in like 15 years . 
  was really impressed by how seedy it was and the sheer amount of sex related services . 
  krakow is beautiful . 
  warsaw has its charms but is very different and quite modern . 
   35-50 $ for a night that 's nothing special  split between three people ok . that 's actually pretty good . 
  and quite incomplete . 
  dropbears are really dangerous .
