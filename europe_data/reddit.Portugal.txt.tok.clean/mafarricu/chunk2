  then why the `` apparently '' ? 
  what 's the reason ? 
  never said i preferred fewer muslims , only that there are fewer . 
  you 're projecting . 
  that would be when eve was created . 
   nice in nice fewer muslims here . 
  true . 
  i personally like it from 20 to 22 . 
  anything over that it 's too warm . 
  it gets much warmer in spain , even before the strait . 
  and changes nothing . 
  the abuser can continue as if nothing happened and the abused is now dead or near starvation . 
  more like the reverse ... 
  morocco is in europe now !, 
  what happened ? 
  never understood these self immolations and hunger strikes . 
  if you are being abused self harm wo n't negatively impact the abuser . 
  tasty research i tell you ... 
  but you guys are friends . 
  you both like weird ( shitty ) porn and everything . 
  we declared war on germany when it was obvious they would lose . 
  way more than 10 times the population . 
  brazil . 
  just some very mild brazilian love . 
  it 's different when i do it !, 
  welcome to the nordic model ... 
  we have exactly the same saying ... 
  i have the idea that even thought i 'd legal and regulated most prostitute 's work effectively outside the law in the strick sense unlike say germany . 
  is this true ? 
  these dancing laws always crack me up . 
   so the dutch have decided that having their tank battalion commanded by germany is better than having no tanks at all . 
  do these people even have memories ?? 
  [ related older post ] ( / r/europe/comments / 4ahyii/shipwreck _ discovered_from_explorer_vasco_da_gamas / ), 
  color me surprised ... 
  true . 
  also clouds ... 
   europe is full of begging gypsies from romania but not begging gypsies from finland . 
  maybe there are n't that many gypsies in finland ... 
  i 'm surprised they go that far north anyway ... 
  sun , in the uk !, 
   given that port can be red/purple , brown or `` white '' you know more than i do and i live here , 
  no way ?!, 
  well , at least he would be representative of his country 's english proficiency ... 
  when i wrote `` for people here '' i meant portugal . 
  unless he considered us arabs/jews your answer does n't say much . 
   fellow ** free ** masons i fixed it for you . 
  otherwise might be confusing, 
   ** port ** - wine stain oddly specific ... 
   local gendarmes stood by and watched how was this justified ? 
  just out of curiosity . 
  what did he have in plan for people here ? 
  i suppose nothing very different but just curious . 
   possibly the `` victim culture '' which is present in the us and in the uk could be imported into europe that ship has sailed and reached its destination . 
  one of the lowest in developed countries . 
   widespread yakuza presence in rapid decline for decades . 
   land of the vikings one day would be considered the most safest place on earth hong kong ? 
  the money i 'm absolutely sure , all you have to consider is the insane number of exchange booths in kowloon to refute it . 
  it 's a cash society and a strange one with different kinds of money depending on the bank printing the money . 
  totally agree . 
  japan 's position on this list is very suspicious . 
   not to mention that you really ca n't live there without a card and a mobile phone not true at all . 
   several thousand a few percent of the total population ... 
  * portugal 18 * japan 22 no statistics can reasonably corroborate this . 
  i think they can discriminate on residence , not nationality . 
  say you 're living there , they ca n't charge you more . 
  at least that 's what i think . 
  anyone nor knowledgeable feel free to correct me . 
   why would i work for free ? 
  because it 's either that ( no overtime compensation ) or unemployment . 
  i barely ever drink alcohol so that 's useless to me . 
   minifridges and camping cookers wtf !, 
  camping cookers on a boat ? 
  are those people crazy ? 
  that 's why we ca n't have nice things ...  3 . 
  viking line does not allow passengers to bring on board food supplies to be used for preparing meals during the voyage . 
  so this i means can take a sandwich , right ? 
  japan probably is . 
  it 's just severely under-reported . 
   if i work over time , i get more vaccation days i 've never met anyone in my life ( other than my father ) that was actually compensated for overtime . 
  same here . 
  i used to be contracted for 35 but worked an average of 55ish . 
  at least i got to start late when i wanted ... 
   if you can do more in in shorter period of time , you do n't get any bonus or go home earlier -- they just give you more job . 
  so a lot of people just are n't motivated to be more productive it 's called presentialism . 
  am i allowed to bring my own ? 
  pretty decent ... 
  just randomly or was there a `` reason '' ? 
  is that what 's really happening there ? 
  how much is it , typically ? 
  maybe the vests are heated ... nah !, 
  france , the queen of not letting go . 
  very british . 
   i think all vatican residents are in celibacy we can only hope for it but i would n't bet on it . 
  no partly because we do n't have `` such a low age of consent compared to other european countries '' . 
  it 's 14 which is not uncommon as can be seen from the map ( i count more than 10 countries in blue ) and from 14 to 16 basically it excludes sex with adults though at the judge 's discretion . 
  we are not an outlier . 
  spain used to be with 13 but no longer . 
  they were an outlier . 
  you win . 
  so inappropriate ...
