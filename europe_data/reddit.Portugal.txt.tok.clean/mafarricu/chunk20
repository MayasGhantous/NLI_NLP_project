  it 's basically a mediumish city on an island / s, 
  i mean i 've had spaniards admit to me in person that even though abroad they 'll say spain is the best , internally there is a lot of self-loathing . 
  funny thing is i had n't been there in decades but remembered the tolls . 
  every spaniard i talked about that denied it . 
  they are still there though most are automatic . 
  the most retarded and dangerous toll system ever . 
  only for internal consumption . 
  abroad they 'll say spain is the best . 
  i 've had spaniards say this to me outright . 
  i 've been on your highways recently . 
  the tolls on the way to santiago deserve an award for being the most retarded i 've ever seen . 
  come here , ours is better , 
   my wage is just a bit more than half the average salary in spain ( which is 1600 $ ) , just to make things clear .

  btw , been there recently ( galicia ) . 
  your restaurants are really expensive , specially compared to porto .

   they also reveal that they knew who the victims/witnesses that were being questioned were and that legal confidentiality was broken .

  este gajo agora ocupa o segundo lugar mais importante da hierarquia do estado ... 
   and if you know something that proves the guilt of anyone in any crime you 're legally obliged to report it to the authorities no he is not . 
  stop perpetuating this bullshit . 
  very few people are . 
  basically authorities and public servants . 
  if he 's called to testify then he is obligated to tell the truth but he has no obligation to `` report it to the authorities '' . 
   and the phone tappings are available online they are not a conspiracy either . 
  really !, 
  where ? 
  she looks way too anorexic . 
  i do n't think he has `` religiously '' divorced his first wife , only civilly . 
  he 's part of the dictatorial regime de facto aristocracy . 
  spain 's unemployment rate is usually more than double that of portugal 's, 
   spanish people completely ignore portugal let 's keep it that way !,

  the overwhelming majority of restaurants do n't even have the styrofoam boxes that american ones have . 
  i think many times they just reuse the food to cook things like meatloaf  that 's my paranoia talking ... 
  i liked it . 
  in here it 's considered to be extremely crass and a source of social shame to do it . 
   but what kind of brexit ? 
  kind of like in america , you leave the restaurant and take everything with you . 
   meanwhile we 're and where are you ? 
  you have no flair !, 
   and crazy neighbor ( bielo ) russia ?
