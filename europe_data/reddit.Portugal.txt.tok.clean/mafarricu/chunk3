  the law is very vague . 
  it 's whatever the judge does n't like . 
  basically the older person must not abuse his experience and knowledge or something like that . 
  no explicit reference to positions of authority or anything like that . 
  if there 's grass on the field , play the game . 
  so many . 
  never noticed it was shackled . 
  very interesting indeed . 
  thanks . 
  portugal has the lowest fertility and lowest age of consent . 
   national animal : unicorn so that 's why i keep seeing in the royal seals ? 
  that 's actually very reasonable . 
  depends on whether the minor is female . 
  if it 's a 14 old boy with a 30 something woman society is overall ok with that . 
  literally if the age is off the clock , it 's ready for the ... 
  vatican city where the age of consent is 12 . 
  edit : was until 2013 apparently but no longer . 
   naimalupa , fuck licence or permission to marry 007 license to fuck . 
  i like that , 
  just out of curiosity . 
  male or female ( or something less common ) ? 
  i 've heard of people congratulating girls for reaching menarche ( kind of weird imo ) but never this . 
  you 're right . 
  i misread . 
  are you serious or joking ? 
  12 is probably still too old . 
  i think they like then even younger . 
  plus a gender neutral language . 
  turkey , a paradise of gender equality . 
   must n't let 18 year olds drink 21 !, 
  not 18 . 
  so same way as in portugal without the 21 explicit provision . 
  in portugal it 's 14 but from 14 to 16 the older partner ( if older than 18 ) can get in trouble . 
  after 16 everyone is good to go . 
  but you have to have that pre-screening right ? 
   hold the phone . 
  is n't it illegal to discriminate based on race ? 
  it 's different when he does it . 
   but i thought race did n't matter ? 
  not `` did n't matter '' , did n't even exist as a concept rooted in reality . 
  i do n't get it either ... 
  careful . 
  if i were you i 'd shit my pants if someone knocked on my door at night . 
  you forgot to say it was banned ** very ** late . 
  i agree . 
  the only portuguese name there is the last one . 
  then again , when it comes to names , in brazil anything goes . 
  anything . 
   xi jinping is also the general secretary of the communist party of china that 's what really counts . 
  so this guy is just a ceremonial puppet . 
  the real power is in the premier of the people 's republic of china, 
  brazilian lives matter . 
  china has a president ? 
  why swiss ? 
   indonesia and malaysia are countries in different region that has also many non muslim neighbours malaysia has large indian and chinese minorities . 
  you ca n't eliminate such large groups as that . 
  that helps . 
   not even mentioning millions from former soviet bloc we got a lot of ukrainians in the 90s . 
  i still remember all the bombings because doctors where being forced to work as construction workers . 
  wait !, 
  i do n't because it never happened . 
   they just become really passive-aggressive and do their job scrupulously which results in you spending a couple of hours more on the border that 's the usual behaviour . 
  i just wanted to be sure . 
   proper border guards not so bad . 
  they could just confiscate everything since i never carry proof that my objects are my property . 
  authorities can be abusive . 
  where and why ? 
   you can smuggle a polar bear in the bus for 5 euros . 
  but if you do n't pay , you are fucked for few hours . 
  do they actually do anything abusive , say physical abuse , `` confiscating '' tablets , phones or any of that stuff ? 
   since the ** usa ** with its bad marriage laws has more babies than any country in the ** usa **, 
   since the usa with its bad marriage laws has more babies than any country in the usa . 
  you drunk ? 
   and guess why 's that . 
  why ? 
   otherwise what should you eat ? 
  only sandwhiches ? 
  they 're called restaurants . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/srebrenica-20-years-after-the-genocide-the-dutch-peacekeepers-still-haunted-by-memories-of-the-10378913.html  mr zomer is quick to acknowledge that the ** main victims ** of what is believed to be the worst massacre on european soil since the second world war ** are the mothers , wives and daughters of srebrenica ** , who lost their men and boys in july 1995 no !, 
  the main victims were the 8000 boys and men killed . 
  people go home for lunch ? 
  right answer . 
  during june sunset is incredibly late in spain . 
  never bought powdered milk in my life . 
  i 'm surprised no one buys it there because the chinese usually buy everything to the point that some places had to ration it . 
  we never had those problems here but i 've read plenty of stories along those lines elsewhere . 
  whole , medium fat and skim milk are pretty much the same price here to . 
  we sell them in 1l containers . 
  cheap ( lasts 4 to 6 months outside the fridge ) you can get for roughly 0.50 eur per l , so 2 eur for 4l . 
  the nicer one that lasts about 4 days in the fridge goes to about 0.70 eur per l so 2.8 eur for 4l . 
  beyond that it 's really fancy stuff . 
  ( organic , goat milk , enriched for babies or old people , etc ) 4.59 cad for 4 l comes to about 3.10 eur for 4l so about 0.80 eur per l . a little more expensive than our medium range stuff . 
  people make a lot less money here than in canada . 
  how can this be best looking ?!, 
  maybe for the colorblind . 
  i knew `` not a mattress '' but it 's the first time i 've read hammock . 
   a loaf of bread was 5 billion so 20 loafs of bread . 
  not that bad ... 
   and i am just scared that i 'll end up in a situation where i need the money . 
  2 \\* 50 or even 5 \\* 20 does the job and avoids a whole lot of hassle .
