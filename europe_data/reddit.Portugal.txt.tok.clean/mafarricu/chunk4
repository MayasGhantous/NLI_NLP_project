  the only case where i 've done that was traveling , but i kept the note hidden so the fact that it was really only one was important . 
   `` fleshlights made from pornstars ' vaginas '' i 've seen those on sale with the supposed porn star 's vaginal secretions bottled for the users enjoyment . 
  now that 's creepy . 
  you carry a 100 $ bank note ? 
  why not 2 50 $ . 
  in here 100 $ might get you in trouble because people might not accept it and the law only says that they have to but do n't have to give you change ( not that many people even know that ) . 
  but it was n't worth shit , right ? 
  could you buy say 1l of milk with that ? 
  that 's actually a pretty decent price . 
   and after let 's use logarithmic money to make change easier . 
  more like inflation easier to calculate . 
  interesting . 
  never thought about it . 
  thanks . 
  great site btw . 
   you still get quasi-fascist regimes like hungary , poland , slovakia , and denmark , not to mention belarus . 
  belarus i understand , but denmark ? 
  he 'll learn to moan/groan in italian and that 'll be it . 
  not really ... 
   15,257 $ / per year before tax , right ? 
  apparently there 's a [ website ] ( http://esmeraldashipwreck.com/ ) . 
   speak german to a level of b1 in san marino ? 
  ours is only valid for 5 !!, 
  how can i get one ? 
   the oldest shipwreck from europe 's golden age of exploration has been found off the coast of oman , the country 's ministry of heritage and culture will announce on tuesday . 
  the wreck is believed to be that of the esmeralda , which was part of a fleet led by legendary portuguese explorer vasco da gama during his second voyage to india ( 1502-1503 ) . 
   if this is indeed a wreck from da gama 's 1502-1503 fleet , ** it will be the earliest ship from the age of exploration ever to be found and excavated ** . 
   further supporting the theory that the vessel was part of de gama 's fleet are 12 gold portuguese cruzado coins from the reigns of joao ii ( 1477-1495 ) and dom manuel i , which were recovered from the wreck in mint condition , as well as ** a silver coin called an \u00edndio ** that dom manuel had minted in 1499 specifically for trade with india . 
  until the excavation , ** only one other example of this coin was known ** , leading scholars to call it the `` ghost coin of dom manuel i. '', 
  very good article overall . 
  yes . 
  but even the estado novo had some distance from catholicism . 
  unlike spain , catholicism was never the official state religion . 
  at least de jure . 
  in old pictures everyone has their head covered either by hats or scarves . 
  those look like picture from a war-zone !, 
  if i were a foreigner i would certainly try to go there . 
  do you have any serious sources for that ? 
  i 've read that multiple times but never actually saw anything very concrete . 
   most likely this . 
  the right wing dictatorship also used this to their advantage but the state at the time of the miracles tried to crack down on it very strongly . 
  picture 32 . 
  33 is also interesting . 
  we got plenty of that and of good quality . 
  i would personally settle with you stopping any endemol shows , in perpetuity . 
   how the dutch ran the global spice trade for 200 years half of the time it discusses what the speaker describes as the portuguese model ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  fucking eu and its severed head quotas and regulations . 
   whack a few barrel bombs onto regularly scheduled ryanair flights , or just fly them with low fuel as usual and make a few extra circles . 
  same effect . 
  [ herenthout total population of 8,361 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herenthout ), 
  glorious pic !, 
  i thought it was turtles all the way down , not just one . 
   realistically it probably should . 
  why ? 
  this was a complete disaster . 
  during june we did have sunlight well after 10pm . 
  just look at china . 
  it 's beijing time everywhere , even on the afghan border . 
  what city is that with the largest portuguese flag ? 
  i would have found it difficult to do otherwise :p, 
  well he does have a penis and all . 
  it 's not like it is n't his fault ... / s, 
  most places already have much lower sentences for mothers that kill their children under 1 year of age so it 's not like there is n't a precedent . 
   every mother can give up her child for adoption not just when it is born . 
  not to mention kill it during the first year at a highly discounted punishment . 
  ( most jurisdictions include clauses for infanticide on the first year that carry a much lower jail time if it 's the mother that does the killing ), 
  letting them go out of their own volition , suffer for their consequences and then publicize it is the best deterrent . 
   japan is a weird mess but seems to have had emperors dating back -600 . 
  supposedly it 's the oldest continuous monarchy . 
  i 'm sure it 's contentious though . 
   i doubt many countries have a continuous state history beyond the xii century , though . 
  japan , china and ethiopia come to mind . 
  the mccann 's had a far greater compensation . 
  oh god !, 
  i had erased that from my mind . 
   i doubt reddit will share data with russian police . 
  reddit maybe not , but maybe there 's some kind of snooping by russian authorities . 
  you do have snowden   i do n't write on russian forums . 
  that 's probably a great idea . 
  do you post here without any kind of anonymity tool ? 
  what about a translation ? 
   well let 's never speak of that again . 
  seems like a modest proposal to me . 
  your brother is ireland , like it or not . 
  they are very independent and have a persecution complex that manifests in a paranoid military fixation . 
  joining a political ( not purely economical ) community of nations is contrary to that worldview . 
  switzerland was n't even a part of the un at that time . 
   they thought that there was no way the people would vote no i would think they would never vote yes . 
  in fact i 'm surprised it was so close . 
  it depends on who wins . 
  if muslims are successful they 'll rewrite history and suddenly christians invaded and muslims just spread the faith . 
  maybe because you 're not an economy minister . 
  just maybe ... 
   vast majority to the most densely populated area of the eu ( england ) . 
  is n't this the netherlands ? 
  did anyone actually believe that the majority of these people are actually fleeing a war zone ?!, 
  maybe a small minority but that 's it . 
  why are they fleeing the place where they were before austria ? 
  it 's not like there 's war in western europe .
