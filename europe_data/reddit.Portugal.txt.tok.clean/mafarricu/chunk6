  it 's not like portugal could defend it . 
  india just invaded goa and that was it . 
  your comment reads like a really strange non-sequitur . 
  i think the guy is just trolling . 
   in sports , we have produced many gold medalists in weightlifting i still remember the bulgarian female weightlifters , i was a teenager and i was really confused by how they looked . 
  i 'd reckon lots of testosterone or maybe sex change . 
  liechtenstein how can it even exist ? 
  when they say welfare benefits , does that mean if i move there to work and get sick i wo n't be able to use the nhs ? 
  but at least sometimes he did so as a swan . 
  got to give him some credit for being nice about it . 
  thanks . 
  will look it up . 
   essentially , in a part of the bible king solomon tells ( poetically ) that he 's packin ' . 
  really ?!, 
  got a reference ? 
   however i 'm afraid i 'm english so i do n't understand it thank god !, 
  i was really doubting my english ability . 
  regarding spain we ignore each other quite well but i guess there is some nagging going on . 
  france because they got a huge immigration wave in 60s but italy ?!, 
  they just do n't care about us neither do we care about them either . 
  you have a very inaccurate view about this . 
   did n't you like them ? 
  first one was actually quite good . 
  second was , well , kinda did n't matter third one was crap . 
   ** tried ** to make portugal a royal province when an attempt was made , portugal left the union . 
  the first 2 kings were actually kind of decent , specially the first . 
  just to make things clear : from 1580 to 1640 portugal and spain had the same monarch but [ were distinct entities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_union ) . 
  this map is very inaccurate . 
   portugal was effectively a royal province under spanish rule . 
  this is not true neither de jure nor de facto . 
  abandon ship . 
  it 's not like we humans colonized antarctica except for scientific research . 
  there must be something of value in greenland for humans to persist in living in such inhospitable conditions . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  beaches are not really my thing . 
  i 'm more into people watching which i 'm sure india will provide in bucket loads . 
  is n't that honduras ? 
  well , someone must always be first ... 
   478 million euros for a place with fewer than 60k people ?!, 
  that 's about 8k eur per person per year . 
  that 's a lot . 
  and here i was planning on visiting india ... 
  we got the nicest exchange rate : 1 eur = 200.482 pte so 5 eur is 1000 pte which was the large unit used daily anyway . 
  very smooth transition . 
  even in the flea markets the gypsies had no problems and did n't fool many people with change . 
  way too much . 
  specially in lisbon . 
  we do have some very nice graffiti on the other hand . 
  uau . 
  who is this guy ? 
  yes . 
  fixed . 
  finland . 
  it 's a warzone i tell you . 
  still an outlier . 
   ** 17 ** typically developing children ( ** range 7 -- 12 yr ** ) were scanned while presented way outside the kindergarten age . 
  also , 17 is a ridiculously small sample . 
   40 + iranian what 's a +40 guy doing in a university dorm ? 
   innate empathy go spend a day at a kindergarten and see if you leave with the same opinion . 
   he 's the world 's foremost expert on game theory since when ? 
  household saints do n't perform miracles . 
   so maybe the eu is not really the problem . 
  nor the solution ... 
  [ bola de berlim / berlin ball in portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_ ( doughnut \\ ) ), 
  listen and believe !, 
  how dare you ? 
  you spelled money wrong . 
   i.e. 
  two idiot hillbillies get drunk , one hits the other with an axe in the head i 've read something regarding bitter land disputes . 
  is this true ? 
  it 's the methane . 
  i swear it 's the methane . 
   while we can not prevent them from getting middle-aged actually you can but it 's not prettier . 
  if you look 10 they wo n't cat call you . 
  come on . 
  do n't exaggerate . 
  been to cadiz . 
  had no problems . 
  did i miss anything ? 
  the old man does n't resemble danish at all . 
   we are not losing the battle for a unified northem germanic dialect , but almost willingly choosing english as the common language . 
  very interesting ... 
  here it 's the opposite . 
  vocabulary and some lexical differences remain but the accents are usually very mild nowadays , even among people say 50 years old . 
  television homogenized everything . 
   and i was like 14-15 at the time . 
  maybe if you were 10 but 14-15 is puberty , they wo n't care about your age , only what you look like . 
  terrible but not unexpected . 
  why has n't television obliterated all this ? 
  it has to a large extent in portugal and even in remote islands like the azores it 's nothing compared to 40 years ago . 
  their unemployment rate is twice as ours . 
  [ not enough jpeg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qezhxp-pdos&amp;hd=1 ), 
  and the pt/es gap widens ... at least positive growth i guess . 
  i was just joking . 
  unless i move there for work and later lose that work . 
  until now i 've given far more to the system than i 've taken from it . 
   so what 's the catch ? 
  you have to be in a really bad financial place . 
   whether or not a claimant is eligible for arbeitslosengeld ii depends on his or her savings , life insurance and the income of spouse or partner . 
  if these assets are below a threshold level , a claimant can get money from the state .
