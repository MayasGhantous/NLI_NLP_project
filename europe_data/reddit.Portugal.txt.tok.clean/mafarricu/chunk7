  the threshold level in july 2008 was $ 150 for free assets ( at least $ 3,100 ) and $ 250 for fixed retirement assets , both calculated per capita and lifetime year . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hartz_concept#hartz_iv so what 's the catch ? 
  otherwise i 'll move there . 
  i 'm very peaceful and law abiding , nothing like the guys you 're getting currently . 
  on top of that i 'm educated . 
  i just do n't know the language . 
  so you get free rent and heating plus  400 $ a month just for breathing ? 
  i thought you ment euros even though you did n't mention it and i was feeling duped . 
  and where are you ? 
   2000 eur net is pretty standard salary this is quite decent even in most western europe . 
   gold as the toilet putin shits in . 
  dude , funniest thing i 've read in a long time . 
  thank you . 
  more than 400 $ !, 
  may i ask doing what ? 
  now all you have to do is make them enroll in your selective service . 
  was n't it up for discussion soon ? 
   very small window . 
  from 15 to 45 about 30 years . 
  so about 1/3 of their adult lives . 
  edit : 30 years not 29 , duh, 
  do it like norway i think . 
  over 35 without children , you get conscripted . 
  now i know why the war ... ca n't say i blame them . 
  that was painful to listen to . 
  sportsmanship , books . 
  always makes me smile . 
  it 's a very common trope among americans that served in the middle east . 
  they would say that the locals would engage in homosexual ( consensual and non-consensual ) acts because the next day at the mosque the slate would be cleaned so to speak . 
  i have no idea whether this is factual or not but it 's a common trope . 
   it 's about feeling ~ ~ good ~ ~ ** superior ** about the fact that you 're so charitable,

  i knew that japanese people have a lot of teeth related idiosyncrasies so i was very skeptical of the confidence intervals being given here when not conditioned on population group . 
  i laughed really hard . 
  thanks !, 
  from the stories i 've read about what happens right before the holiest day of the week ( thursdays i suppose ) , i suppose they have tried it already . 
   but some finns also created the political whiskey party ( ** official name ** ) which has been surprisingly successful !, 
  one ca n't make this shit up !, 
  they did . 
  at least vodafone did . 
  see my technicals post here . 
   and also some muslims whining about the fact that their dishes have touched a pork dish da fuck !, 
  is this real ? 
  bring your own food if you 're that sensitive . 
   religious people should bring their own special food but that would be reasonable . 
  we ca n't have that ... 
  we should make this happen . 
   is the best when it comes to making children stop being naughty . 
  i thought fritzl would be the best . 
  i 'm old and i 'd shit my pants . 
  lisbon . 
  and look , it 's now 16c ;p, 
  seems to me you 're the one that needs to get over `` your father 's abuse '' , not the other guy . 
  you 're unhinged . 
   is hardly anything but generous . 
  it 's passive aggressive at best . 
  we have 15c now . 
  it 's 11am . 
  12c is our min temperature for today , 
  the non www address also seems to be blocked : host - t a carbongames.com .

   i hope you eventually overcome your father 's abuse . 
  a bit uncalled for . 
   i 'm thinking they had a game insulting a political/religious figure . 
  our lady of fatima rts . 
  you have to build enough chapels and rosary shops to meet demand . 
  the month of may is always a bitch . 
   well at least they do n't have gypsies if only ... 
  once the request is made , the 3 isps are a given . 
  there 's no additional effort . 
  it could have been 10 . 
  the system is in place , all it takes is a bogus request upstream . 
  another alternative is some petty revenge . 
  maybe someone with power had some problem with that company . 
  knowing how things work in here this is equally likely . 
  not allowing the `` refugees '' to decide where they go to . 
  this is insanity . 
  all of the eu is at peace , anyplace will do . 
  you 're reading too much . 
  probably just some random fuck up . 
   pretty sloppy work to implement the blocking on the dns layer only . 
  this is the standard practice almost everywhere , with the exception of china which really is sophisticated . 
  what are the sources ? 
  these are very interesting photos . 
  you got it wrong . 
  you can checkout anytime you like , but you can never leave . 
   there is no statute for limitation for murder under german law this is very interesting info . 
  thank you . 
  ps : in here it exists but i 'm not sure what it is, 
   not as much an issue in southern and eastern europe i think . 
  the south is as screwed by this as the north . 
  maybe not the east but then you get other problems . 
   human rights laws and such .
