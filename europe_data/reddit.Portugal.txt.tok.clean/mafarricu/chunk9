  just use the other hole and please jesus . 
  wtf , america has a 4 % teen pregnancy rate !, 
  good old trojan . 
  you can buy them at convenience stores . 
  keep aiming for the stars !, 
  more than the graphics it was the physics engine and real-time economic simulation that impressed me . 
  too many dumb npcs though . 
   something like that on us tv would create a shitstorm without end . 
  that would start civil war in america . 
  very dark humor . 
  never though the french had it in them . 
  but they can already emigrate to portugal legally quite easily . 
  the reverse is not true at all . 
   we 're in eurovision is this true ? 
   will just tell you that the software development did not yet have its `` industrial revolution '' . 
  it is now on the stage where agriculture was when it uses horses and donkeys for everything . 
  i kind of agree and i work in the field . 
   a preview - google iceo . 
  this software can run even projects automatically . 
  that 's the easy part . 
  management is a make belief job based only on social authority . 
  they add no value . 
  now problem solving ... 
  it can be done , do n't get me wrong but it will take some discontinuous jump . 
  just read this paragraph relating to the software you mentioned :  for information on how graphene is produced , iceo asked workers on amazon 's mechanical turk to curate a list of articles on the topic . 
  the resulting list of articles was passed on to technical analysts from odesk ; elance writers then used them to produce a coherent text . 
  that went on to a pool of experts for review , followed by a sequence of odesk editors , proofreaders and fact checkers for finalization . 
   `` yeah , i am sure there is point to it and maybe even important , but i am not quite sure what it is all about '' ok . that 's not as strange . 
   integration language class what is this ? 
  thanks for the reply . 
  i think this is a constant everywhere . 
  also have a look at crab mentality , very similar . 
  i 've been hearing this for over 30 years . 
  in at least their mother language and a foreign one , preferably from a very different family . 
  give me a break !, 
  how can one not understand the ** concept ** of a calendar ? 
  like , seriously !, 
  well apparently i am a second class citizen because some people can move into my country and live here whereas i ca n't move into theirs . 
  ( not talking about the netherlands but according to you places like curacao ), 
   but they can move to - , and live and work in the eu if they want . 
   vice versa is of course not possible . 
  what 's the fairness and reciprocity in this ? 
  how is this even a thing ? 
  thanks . 
  talk about not letting go ... 
   the kingdom is n't an eu memberstate , only the netherlands is how does that work ? 
  you have people in spain dubbing moans in pornos . 
  it ca n't be more difficult than that . 
  good explanation . 
  thanks . 
  so cokcteasing . 
  they are not . 
  i was being facetious . 
   fanservice what 's that ? 
  replace the poles with mexicans . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  i 'm sure the chavs will love it . 
  is it hentai ? 
  ( i 'm not very knowledgeable about this ), 
  yep . 
  i noticed but did n't want to clutter the title, 
   ye , imho if trump was running against sanders things would n't have ended this way . 
  but that would have implied not rigging the primaries . 
  plus : #imwithher #malefeminist and all that jazz, 
  it 's not like it 's very complex technology . 
  you ca n't really compare the urban areas of china with kl . 
  china is way more developed . 
  rural china is probably another matter . 
  thailand is better in my opinion . 
  i 'd rather live in bk than kl . 
  hands down . 
   around the area of setubal i really love the factory/incinerator . 
  it gives the area a trash chique look, 
   best country on earth if you make a decent living go easy . 
  it 's ok but not nearly that good . 
  minimum wage here gets you a better life than minimum wage in the usa , even though it 's much lower . 
   without even a thank you note are you really surprised ? 
  i 'm mildly surprised they did n't leave a `` fuck you '' note . 
  we had a family housed in a tourist resort and they fled during the night to norway . 
  a fucking tourist resort !, 
   malaysia is a developed safe majority muslim country !, 
  i 'd go easy on the developed ... 
   some german ** trying to study ** art in austria, 
   `` they have a right to decide were they want to stay '' . 
  and yet there are a ton of places that if i want to visit i need to pre-arrange a visa . 
  why are these guys special ? 
   might be ** illegal ** economic migrants there . 
  i fixed it for you . 
  i 've got nothing against legal immigrants and genuine refugees . 
   as long as they make money they can send home they are happy how can they send money home while being illegally in a country ? 
  every time i want to to some kind of international financial transaction it 's a nightmare . 
  you have to understand that latvia is a warzone ... 
  these poor people are fleeing war . 
  the one spoken in portugal does . 
  can confirm . 
   speaking as a russian but you have a brazilian flair ... 
  why not both ? 
   tallinn , riga and vilnius really do n't compete with each other , they are so utterly different in their architecture , all three cities look radically different . 
  do n't skip one as some people recommended me . 
  you 're right .
