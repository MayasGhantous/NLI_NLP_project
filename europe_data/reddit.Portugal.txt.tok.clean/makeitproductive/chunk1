productivity is a funny concept , it means something different in economy than what it does in general terms . 
  a baker can bake 5000 loaves in greece in 8 hours and bake 5000 loaves in 8 hours in germany . 
  since the loaves of bread are worth much more in germany his productivity is much higher there ( value created/time ) . 
  the same applies to a nurse or to a mechanic . 
  and i agree with you on industrialization , we really should have , we were too reliant on the primary sector for too long but most of it is due to a dictatorship that only ended in 1974 . 
  salazar used to say agriculture is the way of getting poor in a happy way . 
  now in our condition its hard to revert anything . 
  portugal was very protectionist under salazer/dictatorship up to 1974 . 
  we basically had no imports . 
  you did n't give me any thoughts . 
  but i just checked your comment history and it 's a series of short `` gotcha '' and 4chan like comments like this . 
  you 're not really worth my time , or anyone 's for that matter . 
  over and out . 
  and i 'm a medical doctor . 
  so what ? 
  nothing i said is wrong . 
  debate ideas not people . 
  i never said that , you just chose to interpret what i said that way . 
  portugal made a lot of mistakes , and no one is entitled to anything in this world - you get what you get , no use whining . 
  however it is a truly arrogant and ignorant to think that circunstances do n't play a role . 
  and that `` working hard = success '' when it comes to nations . 
  just look at the world , just look at history !, 
  portugal was a world power once - when our geographic location and naval prowess were a factor . 
  norway was poor before oil was relevant to world economics . 
  look at the greeks - they work the longest hours in europe - are you suggesting they 're lazy ? 
  my grandparents were some of the poorest people on earth . 
  my grandmother only had tea to drink and nothing to eat for days . 
  she taught herself how to read . 
  are you saying she was n't determined ? 
  do you think the irish during the famines were less hard working and organized than today ? 
  or do you think being an english speaking country next to europe 's biggest finance center with `` special corporate deals '' might have something to do with half the tech companies in europe being there ? 
  i really enjoyed reading `` the wealth of nations '' . 
  it 's a great book that helped shape economy , i would advise you read it . 
  portugal has decreased dramatically as well , it 's just hard to notice because the base line is so low . 
  a good way to understand why this happens is to ask what makes a country rich , instead of asking why is portugal and southern europe poor . 
  you 'll find it 's mainly a combination of big business , industry , banking/financial industry and oil . 
  portugal has none of those things , and wo n't have any time soon . 
  we also have issues like a big public sector ( much smaller nowadays ) and debt . 
  for example imagine netherlands without : heineken , ahold , philips , tomtom , unilever , randstad . 
  no attractive corporate taxes and tax havens for corporations from other countries . 
  now place it away from the center of europe , next to greece . 
  now imagine you 're in charge of making this new made up country grow , and you have absolute power over it . 
  a few other features of the game are : 1 ) over 15 % of your revenue goes to paying interest . 
  about 5 times what you have for your health sector . 
  2 ) add to that a small but very unhealthy banking system that you have no power over ( ecb is calling the shots and half the time it 's adds a couple of billions to the deficit randomly ) . 
  3 ) your working age people has fled to other eu countries , and you have more people receiving pension than wages . 
  that 's portugal . 
  as you can see it 's no easy tasking making it grow . 
  the euro might undervalued in germany ( and overvalued in other eu economies ) but that is only due to over-saving and excessive wage restraint for over a decade in germany . 
  only in the past couple of years have your real wages grown and public expenditure risen , and even then wages only by 2.8 % / year . 
  and your infrastructure ( bridges for example ) could have used more investment in previous years . 
  more expansionary fiscal policy would help , particularly if this took the form of cuts in value-added taxes and lower income taxes for people on low incomes . 
  ( from the article i cited ) but i agree a lot of it is structural . 
  over-saving and underspending is culturally german . 
  i remember the trouble you guys had with big companies threatening jobs and a state wide minimum wage . 
  it 's a hard problem to solve , but let 's not pretend it does not exist . 
  i 'm not saying they are in the wrong for taking advantage of greek instability , i 'm just saying that `` german taxpayers are paying for the greek crisis '' mantra that is repeated so often here is just plain wrong . 
  the greeks are paying for the greek crisis , germans are profiting from it . 
  you are not a hero or a martyr if you benefit from a gambler 's adiction , just an opportunist . 
  it is exactly as you described . 
  now you see the problem with it . 
  the other issue , is that due to societies safety net we are forced to attribute a minimum pension to anyone after a certain age , even if they did n't contribute a cent in our country . 
  so in the end we have guys who worked in france their whole lives come back to portugal after retirement , buy huge houses , keep their money stashed away/in real estate and still get a pension . 
  unsustainable . 
  the 100b $ figure comes from a study from the german iwh that was reported everywhere , including [ forbes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33845836 ) and [ bbc ] ( http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?/sites/timworstall/2015/08/11/despite-losing-tens-of-billions-of-e-germany-is-making-a-profit-out-of-the-greek-crisis/&amp;tourl=http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/08/11/despite-losing-tens-of-billions-of-e-germany-is-making-a-profit-out-of-the-greek-crisis/&amp;refurl=https://www.google.pt/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.pt/ ) . 
  even if greece defaulted germany would still make a profit - from the same study . 
  germany wo n't lose a cent . 
  they actually profited , got another economy to keep down the euro , and got a new source of qualified professionals . 
  do you know who lost in the middle of all this ? 
  the regular greek guy . 
  it 's true no one forced them to join the eurozone when it is clearly a bad deal for any small economy without a gimick ( tax havens , points of entry , huge port ... ) , it was their mistake . 
  they had their own share of troubles as well . 
  but the eu was n't a lifeboat but actually the final nail in the coffin . 
  germany is n't the good guy . 
  the question asked to german people was never what is better for greece , but what is better for germany in the long term . 
  and they acted accordingly as a huge loan shark to keep their own interest , a eurozone that heavily favors them , alive . 
  do n't be fooled by the idea of european solidarity because that does n't exist . 
  it 's every nation for itself with a few cultural and financial alliances in the middle . 
  i do n't really get that . 
  the rule is about protecting the eu as a whole . 
  the rule is about the global surplus which is [ undeniably ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2013/bulletin_93_js_st_article2-8164.pdf ) bad , not the surplus with the eu . 
  this global surplus rule hurts other eu economies and the rule is being broken pointing out it 's not with the eu is just not relevant in any way . 
  hey , i do n't mean to be patronising in any way , actually i used to think a lot like you do . 
  but you should read a bit about the subject , since it 's a lot more complicated than that . 
  there were a lot of structural problems and downright fraud in greece , but the eu didnt help them . 
  it actually made it a whole lot worse . 
  as for germany paying for it ... well , germany profited about 100 billion $ from the greek crisis so far between 2010-2015 , and a lot of the bad assets were private german companies . 
  as for allowed surplus it 's a rule in the eu that states that for the good of the union no state should exceed a 6 % trade surplus , basically the balance between exports and imports , and germany has broken that rule since 2011 . 
  something that hurts your country , mine and every other in the eu . 
  not downvoting you , just know that the world is a complex place , and do n't expect to find good guys and bad guys in world politics . 
  every state looks after itself , and germany is no exception . 
  there have been consequences . 
  a lot of political instability and higher interest on public debt when the sanctions loomed over portugal and spain . 
  and the trade surplus rule does n't apply to the eurozone , but to the global trade surplus - for a good reason . 
  the global surplus hurts every other country just as much . 
  i do n't get the whole `` surplus not being in the eurozone as an excuse '' that i see a lot in this subreddit by german users . 
  it just makes no sense . 
  i 'm genuinely curious , is that something that shows up in your news ? 
  i 've read a lot on the subject , but i like [ this short 2 page document ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2013/bulletin_93_js_st_article2-8164.pdf ) the best . 
  it 's a very consensual topic everywhere .
