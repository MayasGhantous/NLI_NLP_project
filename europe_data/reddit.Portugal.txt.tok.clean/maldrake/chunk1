i have said no such thing . 
  mate ... [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l4ff4/what_do_europeans_think_of_asia/clrl1cj ) . 
  you wrote you agree with the guy that 's saying that europe is not a ~ ~ country ~ ~ continent . 
  maybe i misunderstood ? 
  edit : unless -  maybe . 
  also whoops . 
  why the hell are you turning this on him ?!, 
  it is you and the other guy that are saying that most geographers believe that europe is not a continent . 
  ** you 're ** the ones that should come up with sources !, 
  what is the spanish region , might i ask ? 
  i ca n't seem to find any definition of it online . 
  taxi . 
  i would say perhaps a retiree car too , but the trend started to shift in audi 's direction in the 90 's .

  jorge silva de carvalho , a former director of sied , `` allegedly '' used his post to benefit a private media company called ongoing . 
  he `` allegedly '' fed privileged information about several media mergers in angola and brazil to said company . 
  this scandal broke when he was exonerated of service from sied and immediately went to work for ongoing . 
  after this scandal , our already unreliable secret services suffered their final blow , and were finally isolated from the international intelligence community . 
   i dont know where you get that , you barely even see people talk about them `` ongoing '' . 
  does this word ring a bell ? 
  oh , i never said we did n't have secret services . 
  i just wrote that we do n't have any properly functioning . 
  both sis and sied are run by skeleton crews and were essentially isolated from the intelligence community a few years back after a string of embarrassing leaks . 
  portugal does n't even have functioning secret services . 
  how the hell are we spying on anyone ... 
  wow , for once , portugal did n't fuck up . 
  that 's an achievement . 
  one of my dreams is to take the trans-siberian railroad from moscow to vladivostok . 
  i would love to have a chance of touring the russian far east . 
   how about it 's something like 50 % to blame . 
  i disagree . 
  it goes far , far deeper . 
  i 'd say we maintain serious cultural , structural and demographic problems from since at least 40 years ago .

  haha , they even ignore the horning , goddamn reindeer . 
  also , perkele . 
  what about ... ? 
  it 's not silly . 
  it addresses ( wrongly ) a very valid concern . 
   is the rule really botched though ? 
  i believe so . 
  i think that the basis of this law , which to empower anonymous individuals against misuse of public information by major companies , is pretty remarkable . 
  the execution , however , is terrible because the law itself is vague enough that allows useful and still relevant information to be filtered . 
  the criteria for deletion of content is left for the company to decide , which i believe is a mistake , since the company will probably accept almost all requests so it can avoid being permanently thrown into court . 
   what is there to complain about , eh ? 
  everything ? 
  this is clearly a rule that was made with good intentions , but had its execution botched . 
  so it must be changed . 
  complain on facebook , write to your mep , vote yes , or do whatever rocks your boat ...  you asked , you received . 
  besides , who is you ? 
  ... what ? 
   `` caralho mais longe '' there 's a variation of this in lisbon , i think `` caralho mais velho '' , or the oldest cock . 
  that 's exactly what i 've been saying to my friends that laugh at spain ... we 'll be probably going back to europe in the same plane as the spanish . 
  the same in portugal . 
  being far-right is still a big fucking taboo in a society that mainly associates it with fascism . 
   it 's really weird to me how reddit and especially / r/europe [ 1 ] have gone from being so staunchly anti-war and anti-military to literally calling upon the eu to emulate the us in both strength and activity . 
  that did n't really happen . 
  it 's just the same people that are screaming louder . 
   then i read about them , learned the statistics , accepted a few common sense realities , and realised what a firearm really is , and now i could n't imagine myself without one . 
  can you share some of those ? 
  for science ? 
  i do n't really have an opinion about the right to bear arms and would like some information . 
  you can speak galician to me , no worries . 
  what, 
  if you 're really desperate , you can go to the taguspark dorms . 
  they 're at ~ 1/4 capacity . 
  the lisbon ones are full , for obvious reasons . 
   unfortunately , our assholes in the government decided to buy some american jets . 
  it 's worse . 
  you bought them from ** us ** . 
  they were already f16a/b rust-buckets when they came to portugal . 
  [ these ] ( http://na.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/ ) are the available accommodations for students in my former uni . 
  the costs are the same ( 166 $ single room , 135 $ double ) . 
  left diagram : - dark grey : regular regime non-renewables , - dark blue : big hydro , - dark green : special regime renewables ( check right diagram for share of renewables ) , - light grey : special regime non-renewables ( dunno ) , - red : imported right diagram : - light green : wind , - orange : biomass , - yellow : solar , - light blue : small hydro notes : as usual , portugal is going to `` cheat '' the 2020 target by abusing big hydro ( predicted +8000 mw total by 2017 ) and completely ignore the other renewables . 
  edit : in total the share of the energies is as follows : - 26,3 % big hydro , - 24,6 % regular regime non-renewables ( gas , coal , diesel , etc ) , - 23,2 % wind ( thank 2013 's bad weather for that ) , - 11,6 % special regime non-renewables ( i do n't know what the heck is this ) , - 5,5 % imports ( thanks spain and france nuclear ) , - 5,3 % biomass , - 2,6 % small hydro , - 0,9 % solar ( portugal has very low sunlight , secure sources write ), 
   that 's pretty much what i said . 
  you singled out / r/europe . 
  i wrote that the dislike for russia is uniform in all reddit , but more regular on / r/europe ( the fact that russia is part of europe and that there are plenty of countries that interacted with russia might also have to do with this ) . 
   they can hold those grudges if they like of course , especially if they 're `` not unreasonable '' . 
  but that wo n't do them much good in the long run , neighbours which hold grudges against each other and who can track history of those grudges `` we did that to you because you did it to us earlier , which you did because we did something else even earlier and so on '' to pre-historical times are just forced to continue that chain of violence in the future . 
  it takes two to tango , and in this situation i think it is not unreasonable ( what a buzzword , eh ? ), 
  to assume that russia should take the first step to mend relations . 
   i hope it does n't sound menacing or something , i really do n't want to fight with anyone , i hope it 's clear . 
  but that chain will go on unless we 'll start trying to understand each other , but it 's not the case with / r/europe , it 's not about understanding . 
  how is it not about understanding ? 
  croats and serbs , poles and germans , french and british , portuguese and spanish . 
  all these nations that once were bitter enemies are now steady allies . 
  it 's not perfect , there is discord , but it is far better than it ever was . 
  why ca n't russia try and be like that ? 
   it 's something like this - `` oh , we 're all great people who live in peace and trying to be sensible and understanding to others , we really like everyone in europe , everyone are great and lovely , and now when we finally established some common grounds between our wonderful nations ... let 's crap on some russians together ! '', 
  it 's not about crapping on russians . 
  it is , again , about the fact that russia does n't want to establish a common ground with ** anyone ** . 
  it 's their way , or the highway . 
   yup , it 's / r/europe [ 1 ] , reddit 's official club of butthurted by russia :-) i think that there 's a pretty uniform , i would n't call it dislike , but disdain , for russia in all reddit ( i mean , the other guys are americans ) . 
  it is intensified in / r/europe , because there is a set of europeans that had , and still have , extremely negative interactions with russia .
