  you are right . 
  please do correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't think you can do business in the eu without a physical subsidiary for tax purposes . 
  ironically enough , this submission itself is a violation of rediquette . 
  since you have an healthy shade of green at the right of your name , i 'll go out of my way and explain why i ** would ** ( i did n't ) downvote sturle 's posts . 
  i 'll begin with his first post :  norway do not want to become member eu , and never will . 
  ok , why ? 
   we have had referendums two times were people have turned down membership , ok , why ? 
   and eu is even less tempting now with the euro-mess . 
  ok .  iceland may become member , and more ex-yugoslav states . 
  correct , they 've applied for ascendancy . 
   turkey will probably not get full membership , but some kind of association . 
  ok , why ? 
  have they not applied for ascendancy like the other countries ? 
   and there it will end . 
  ok , why ? 
   they now have more dysfunctional corrupt economies than germany can pay for . 
  there is absolutely no value in this wall of text to the discussion at hand . 
  why i *** would *** downvote his second post :  this has nothing to do with conditions . 
  norway want freedom . 
  i can relate to that , although one might say freedom is a condition , but i wo n't digress by discussing semantics . 
   we have been ruled from copenhagen , stockholm and berlin i can relate , being ruled by an oppressive foreign entity is terrible , and nazi germany definitely was not a kind occupier ( possible grammar mishap ) . 
   we do not want to be run from brussels too . 
  there was no `` logical hyperspace jump '' in this sentence . 
  none at all . 
   besides eu now need someone to pay for south european corruption and economic incompetence . 
  i completely see where he is coming from . 
  however , norway still paid for `` south european corruption and economic incompetence '' : directly through the imf , indirectly through the efsf ( through norway 's state-owned `` oilfund '' investment bank ) ^ huehuehue ^ i ^ take ^ ur ^ muny ^ huehuehue . 
   eu is a mess . 
  but it not our mess . 
  of course it is n't . 
  it 's not like the eu countries are norway 's main trade partners . 
  now lastly , i actually downvoted your post ( sorry ) because it violates reddiquette ; from your link :  complain about the votes you do or do not receive , especially by making a submission voicing your complaint . 
  you may have just gotten unlucky . 
  try submitting later or seek out other communities to submit to . 
  millions of people use reddit ; every story and comment gets at least a few up/downvotes . 
  some up/downvotes are by reddit to fuzz the votes in order to confuse spammers and cheaters . 
  this also includes messaging moderators or admins complaining about the votes you did or did not receive , except when you suspect you 've been targeted by vote cheating by being massively up/downvoted . 
  tl ; dr downvotes possibly justified ( unlikely as it is , after all , my point of view ) , check . 
  self-righteousness at unhealthy levels , check . 
   it seems rather contraproductive to me to then send all the cpus to the uk before exporting them to other countries . 
  they 're not . 
  arm holdings only licenses the cpu blueprints and instruction set . 
  the licensing deals will have heavier import tariffs for usa companies ( apple , microsoft , motorola mobility ) than , for example , south korean ( lg , samsung ) and taiwanese ( htc , asustek ) companies . 
  it could possibly make licensing arm cpus more expensive for usa companies ( * intel rubs hands * ) . 
  the company ( arm holdings ) that licenses the designs is based in cambridge , uk . 
   also the eu is banning coal power in 2015 huh , if that 's true , my country is pretty much is fucked . 
  oh please , get a grip ... do n't twist my words . 
  the book is not meant as a literal example of russian foreign policy . 
  russia might have geopolitical goals in eastern europe , heck , some of them might even figure on that book . 
  using it , however , as a clear indicator of ~ ~ said goals ~ ~ anything is what warrants a `` fucking seriously ? '' . 
  that 's what i meant . 
   they told me how [ russia has no plans for eastern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) and is the e.u. 
  's best friend and would n't impose themselves , so there was no need for a deterrant . 
  you believe that shit ? 
  wow . 
  what next ? 
  adam and eve ? 
  i am a giant among my people . 
  tell that to the people with pipes clogged with limestone . 
   what waste , since you mention it , does portugal experience because of eu regulation and constraints ? 
  what would help ? 
  it 's quite the opposite actually . 
  i feel that the money from different pools ( cap , fisheries ) is handed too nonchalantly , at least in portugal . 
  there was a scandal some years ago , because some smartass decided to form a ghost company in \u00c9vora whose single objective was to rack cap subsidies and do nothing ... 
  they managed to do that for some months until the retards were caught , but this is not a single example . 
  there are many more . 
  still in the area of regulations , i think that scaling down a bit the stuff coming from china would be of great benefit , not only for portugal , but for the rest of europe too ...  where specifically , what private industry , would you want to see investment in . 
  ( private sector being a portuguese aspect of portuguese tax ) luxury textures and footwear . 
  the clich\u00e9d tech startups . 
  expansion of current aeronautic industry ( though embraer only came here because ~ subsidies ~ ) . 
  r&d labs , etc , etc. . . 
   that said , what issues do you think portugal has , considering its current economic issues , with the current eu model ? 
  what changes would help portugal . 
  right now ? 
  money transfers ( unfeasible because no one would be dumb enough to trust us with such amounts of cash ) . 
  for the future ? 
  efficiency . 
  yep . 
  that simple . 
  we spend a similar amount of % gdp in education and health compared to other developed countries , and yet our systems are n't nearly as good as theirs . 
  why ? 
  waste . 
   there 's the argument of lowering eu regulation on small businesses , and thus allowing a fresh line of competition and possibly a rejuvenating line for a struggling economy through innovation , but what other aspects might help portugal ? 
  we already have good conditions for medium/small businesses ... 
  they pay less tax ( both income and employee social security ) , they can use the `` recibos verdes '' * . 
  so what 's the problem , you ask ? 
  no investment . 
  no credit . 
  banks do n't loan money , investors gtfo because of nasty economical conditions . 
  \\* hard to explain , the original `` recibos verdes '' were intended for independent workers ( 1-man business ) to make it easier for them to pay taxes and whatnot . 
  however , it pretty much ended being a legal loophole that allows avoidance of further social security costs , avoidance of 14-month paychecks ( they 're a pay-as-you-do contract ) and avoidance of most labour laws ( you can pretty much fire them on the spot without compensation and previous notice , you just have to stop issuing them the `` recibos verdes '' ) . 
  so in the end , our biggest problem is n't the eu nor it 's institutions . 
  it is mainly internal . 
  sure, 
  thank you . 
  the article is paywalled . 
  it was n't a joke . 
  compare the two shit-tier countries ( hint : portugal and greece ) in southern europe with the two top-tier countries in northern africa ( dunno ... tunisia and algeria ? ) . 
  people are * far worse * anywhere in northern africa . 
   the situation in the south is even worst .
