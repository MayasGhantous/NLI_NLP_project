  however , trying to paint guns as everyday utensils is , at best , faulty logic . 
  they are n't . 
  guns are weapons . 
  the fact that they can harm and kill is not an undesired secondary effect ... 
  it is their main purpose . 
  well witcher is a great trilogy , you do n't know what you are missing . 
  i recently cut my thumb in a rusty chain , had to take a shot of immunoglobulin in the hospital er and had to show up in my usf next day for the 20y booster ( i 'm 27 now ) . 
  got chewed both by the er nurse and by my family doctor . 
  go take the booster portubros . 
  they 're free and only take 10-15 minutes to administer . 
  they also do n't want to stay in southern europe . 
  you , your country . 
  all victims of the dreaded `` european hate-machine '' . 
  so an experiment that began two years ago in one pre-school is already giving results in the teenage population ? 
   this spiteful atmosphere really shows that the european cause has a long way to go . 
  please do explain this logical leap . 
  because their crisis is totally related to the eu and the $ and not with their irresponsible banks which had to be bailed out by the irish taxpayer . 
  whoa , that 's a big logical leap you 're taking there . 
  when he 's not trolling ( which is only about 15 % of the time ) uat2d has a pretty balanced opinion . 
  i 'm afraid that you , however , are mistaking personal preference with substance . 
  there were , what , 500 people protesting ? 
  why would i go and trash the person who has the least blame for our problems ? 
  nononononono y u shame us lacor, 
  they can still be right about the euro-breakup in 2012 !!, 
  you 're so bitter , it 's funny . 
  my whole family drives european cars . 
  my father drives a range rover , my step mother drives a peugeot 407 , my mother drives a mini and i drive a 1994 renault clio bebop ( aawwwww yeah ) . 
  take a chill pill . 
  he probably is trying to write in portuguese . 
  i think `` evolu\u00e7\u00e3o '' is written `` evolu\u00e7om '' in galician .

  how do you even know this ... have you ever left your village ? 
  you sure like to write about something so irrelevant . 
  you 're a victim of the machine , man . 
  they want to kill you . 
  they want your monies . 
  they want your jerbs . 
  they want your freedom . 
  you 're giving yourself too much credit .

  oh man i love generalizations . 
  they are in part shunning the project of their major european partners . 
  what did you expect ?

  quite the contrary , it is time for the people to show what they really want and , obviously , understand the consequences such decision carries .

  haha , nice try . 
  the burden of proof is on you . 
  the only thing i wrote was that you were bullshitting when you wrote the following quote :  its ironic that languages make native versions of new words to preserve their language when that practice is precisely why languages die out . 
  i can do something cool like that too : `` english as a * lingua franca * is going to die out because i said so and chinese supremacy , etc. . . '', 
  `` hey guys , let me just come here and say some random bullshit i just made up and then leave assured i 'm right . '',

  you have to give it time . 
  the government is n't going to fall . 
  you 're being pessimistic . 
  people are angry and will shake angry fists at the sky today , but private workers will turn on public workers as soon as public transportation starts having strikes . 
  besides , even though passos coelho said the measures were set in stone , he 'll probably backtrack a little when the huge public unions start pressuring him . 
  edit : i eased the rethoric a little bit . 
   why ? 
  why is it a good idea to spend money on failed regions ? 
  if a country or region ca n't handle competition , if it fails to produce , if it fails to invest , then lowering of living standards until a balance is achieved is the only solution . 
  that 's some nasty rethoric and pretty much unfeasable wherever you go . 
  what if there are no resources on said region ? 
  not everything comes from lack of inovation or competitivity . 
  portugal 's debt is going to skyrocket from 2015 on due to payments coming from the dreaded public-private parternships .

  he said it himself . 
  which is what sparked this whole exchange . 
  but by all means , keep complaining about karma , it usually works so well . 
  that is why the discusion of the possible bias of these rankings spawned . 
  ok , then . 
  language should not be a factor in the decision of a publications * utility * . 
  regardless . 
  were they worthless ? 
   if you want an audience , you do have to consider what the audience speaks . 
  irrelevant . 
  i changed the metaphor so that it brings it closer to my argument : language should not be a factor in the decision of a publications quality . 
  well , with french being the science lingua franca of that time , would you consider those publications worthless ? 
  what ? 
  but this is worhtless mathematics . 
  they 're not in english ... also : euler did n't publish in french only , champ . 
  i know , [ right ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/cauchy.jpg ) ? 
  actually , no . 
  it is exactly the worthiness that is in cause , at least in crsp 's point of view . 
  a central language is merely a convenience . 
  yesterday it was french , today is english , and tomorrow it might be chinese .
