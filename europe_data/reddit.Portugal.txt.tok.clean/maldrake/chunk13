  your metaphor is irrelevant . 
  a more apt metaphor is that the pie tastes bad , because instead of being given a fork , you were given chopsticks . 
  ninja edit : change the metaphor , mine was wrong too . 
  are mathematics a science ? 
  so only research in english is valid and worthy ? 
  the soviet union was far from being egalitarian . 
  it was a society where there were two extreme classes . 
  even on the worst ez countries today , you have a more egalitarian society than soviet union 's . 
   i lived in the soviet union and i did not see what egalitarianism is ? 
  it was n't even near egalitarianism . 
  following that train of thought , social safety nets and welfare are useless because they do n't work in central african countries . 
   and yes , 50 + % taxes on salaries + other taxes and regulations are the very factors that contribute to the corruption levels that we have . 
  corruption is your fault . 
  the culture , the people . 
  not the money . 
   georgians managed to reform their tax code and got rid of corruption . 
  wrong . 
  they remain a very corrupt country . 
   ok , i live in ukraine . 
  that 's a part of the problem . 
  [ corruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) in ukraine makes other more corrupt ez countries look like havens of honesty ( except greece , maybe ) . 
   if ** i paid all taxes on my salary ** it would be around 50 % you 're the other part of the problem . 
   i do n't think that `` egalitarianism '' is a good idea at all . 
  you have never seen it first hand , how can you even like it or not . 
   and even if there are homeless people , well ... it 's their choice to live such life . 
  this , right here , is a jewel . 
  really . 
   probably because they do n't print merkel with nazi uniform in the newspapers portugal does n't too . 
  spain neither . 
  i think he was ironically criticizing the voting system . 
  well , he could be using that extra money to save the world . 
  apparently all republics in europe are federal . 
  is this some kind of subtle hint ? 
  i just edited italy out then . 
  i think that 's a no-brainer . 
  the moment you remove greece , the markets will look at the rest ( portugal , spain and ireland ~ ~ and italy ~ ~ ) and say `` what 's the hold up ? 
  boot them already !, 
  no way in hell that spineless weakling would put himself in such position . 
   that 's for healthcare in portugal though no , these are the applying rules to a portuguese ehic card . 
   healthcare in the uk is free at the point of delivery , so he does n't need to do anything . 
  i was n't disputing that , i was just showing what he had to do to be able to apply to an ehic through his portuguese ancestry . 
  he probably ca n't . 
  let me just signal the following parts :  como posso obter o cesd ? 
  ou particular . 
   o cesd \u00e9 nominativo e individual . 
  tl ; dr - you need to have a social security number ( more information [ here ] ( http://www2.seg-social.pt/ingles/ ) ) or to have an sns ( portuguese nhs ) usercard . 
  to have either you need to be one of the following : - born and ** living ** in portugal - legalized worker in portugal - legalized resident of portugal - be part of the family of one of the above ( means fiscally dependent family , if you deliver taxes on your own , you ca n't enjoy these benefits ) edit : formatting , : cripes :, 
  lisbon is 1.25 $ ( or 1.15 $ if you use the zapping * system ) for a ticket + 0.50 $ for the card ( does n't count since you can return them for the same price ) . 
  minimum wage is 485 $ . 
  * zapping is basically the same card but you charge them with money ( instead of tickets ) and you can use it in any public-owned transportation in lisbon . 
  edit : corrected portugal -  lisbon, 
   you missed the point . 
  and i said nothing of bush and obama . 
  i was pointing out that the west needs libya to be unstable in order to creeple russia 's and iran 's military and oil trades one at a time . 
  currently , it 's syria . 
  the creepling of the military trade is obvious . 
  the oil one not so much , but may i remind you also that a huge oil reserve has recently been found on the mediterranean seafloor between cyprus , syria and israel . 
  guess who will get it all now . 
  certainly not syria , and cyprus will do as it 's told . 
  no , i did n't miss your point . 
  all i said is that gaddafi was bad , and that we was not the lesser of two evils , mainly because i think a chance should be given to the new government that took office today ( 8/8/2012 ) . 
  i did n't say anything about the geopolitical situation of northern africa and middle east . 
  is this officially supported by the federal government or the bundestag ? 
  theoretically you could choose from spanish , french , english and german . 
  however , as pretty much everyone chooses english , it became a de facto foreign language i study , because usually there is n't enough people to form a different class with a different fli study ( public school welp ) . 
  the `` escola secund\u00e1ria '' ( 10th-12th grades ) that i frequented had german and english classes available for the fli study ( no french and no spanish ) . 
  it varies a lot , but from personal experience from the lisbon area schools , french is rarer . 
   douchebag maldrake : complains about wall of text ; writes wall of text . 
  that 's mean . 
   brace yourself for the clich\u00e9 quotation retort . 
  you asked for it . 
   that 's demagoguery . 
  that 's the truth . 
  stuff like april 25th is the exception , not the rule . 
   libya is riddled with sectarian muslim extremists now . 
  it 's not a case of a convoluted post-revolution state . 
  it 's a case of tribal fragmentation of the country . 
  but each tribe wants the rest of libya for themselves too , and wants everyone else dead . 
  assumptions . 
   gadafi was a way better option than that you do n't know that . 
  you can say whatever you want when you have a comparable timeframe of the current political system . 
   gadafi would have crushed these religious rebellions independent of their ` democracy and freedom sponsored by the west ' propaganda and the rest of libya would thank him for that . 
  again , you do n't know that . 
  again , you 're just making assumptions and conjectures . 
   you 're avoiding the fact that the ` libyan rebels ' are various tribes of muslim extremists who want to restore an islamic theocracy in libya , each group at the expense of the others . 
  by avoiding this simple fact , you validate your argument that gadafi is bad and anything that takes his place is better . 
  but you 're wrong . 
  a revolution is n't always the right process for progressive and constructive change , especially a religion-driven ` revolution ' gamed by western interests . 
  no , my argument is that gaddafi is bad because he did bad things . 
  in my whole text i ask you to point where i wrote that the current system is better than gaddafi ? 
  that 's right , i did n't . 
  what i did wrote , is that gaddafi is n't the lesser of two evils . 
  it is too soon to pass judgements of value on the other ` evil ' . 
   edit : on this note , you might want to acknowledge that the west intervened in libya for reasons that had nothing to do with the libyan people 's freedom and democratic universal rights . 
  this is n't my fucking point . 
  i 'll acknowledge whatever you want . 
  bush did bad things ? 
  yes , he did . 
  bush was a dictator ? 
  no , he was n't .
