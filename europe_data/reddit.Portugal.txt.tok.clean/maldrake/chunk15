  one example does n't set the rule . 
   my job is to keep everyone below me employed and happy . 
  haha . 
  nope , your job is to make money . 
   i can not do that with dead weight that represents a significant portion of our revenue . 
  ` welp , i failed at recruiting people , can i not be accounted for it and simply be able to write a 200 worded polite `` fuck off '' ? ', 
   it 's not like we will only hire in the us ( though it does have good laws for us ) . 
  over half our staff is in canada because the laws there are sane . 
  great . 
   europe is just a horrible place for small business to do business . 
  so we do n't hire there . 
  bzzt . 
  wrong . 
  it 's a bad place for `` start ups '' , venture capitalists and whatnot . 
  and that might not be a bad thing . 
  responsability and accountability are a bitch right ? 
  a mandar vir da mesa do computador . 
  haha he deleted it . 
  terrorists !!!!, 
  all of them !, 
   i 'm sorry but i will stop replying now . 
  do n't bother really , you 're ignored . 
  what part of this [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/w9veh/uk_50000_fewer_students_apply_for_university_as/c5by9ee ) do n't you understand ?!, 
  here , let me quote the important part :  also i am in an income bracket that probably exempts me from any kind of social support ( i have a part-time job more a little money from my father ) . 
  jesus christ , what crawled up your ass ? 
  how is that not clear ? 
  i 'm not going to be able to pay my debts if i take a loan . 
  no , i ca n't afford it . 
  i 'm not rich enough to pay the fees by myself and my parents help . 
  i 'm not be able to pay the loan + interest . 
  how am i using the word affordable wrongly ? 
  what a shameful display by my country ... 
  i 'm not really understanding your point . 
  are you assuming that i 'm going to take student loans ? 
  i 'm not . 
  also i am in an income bracket that probably exempts me from any kind of social support ( i have a part-time job more a little money from my father ) . 
  the best case scenario would be if i was at the lowest income bracket ( i 'm not ) , in which the fees are about 4000 $ . 
  i agree . 
  when i was n't allowed to make a nuclear reactor in my house , i was appalled at the blatant restriction of my personal freedom . 
  this goddamned police state , always telling me what to do . 
  pick up that can citizen . 
  yes , that is what i said . 
  i can not agree more with you . 
  railways are awesome . 
  one of the things that are making me really sad in portugal right now , other than the economic apocalypse , is the fact that railways that i used are being closed , making me go by bus or car , which is n't the same thing . 
  i agree . 
  i got out of london and went to berkshire ( the windsor castle was cool ) and oxfordshire ( loved oxford and loved staying in henley-on-thames ) and had the time of my life . 
  london itself was awesome for 2-3 days , after that i got a bit disillusioned . 
  you have to understand that we portuguese do n't get to see fjords that often . 
  the book pages have a digital signature and two carbon paper copies : one for the customer , other for the owner to send to the ic or asae ( the national force mentioned by [ metaluim ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/w9hbl/where_are_europes_biggest_tourist_traps_where/c5bh6ti ) ) while the original stays in the book . 
  if you suspect the complaint was n't sent , you can submit/send your own . 
  wow . 
  11350 euros is a lot of money for a fee . 
  i was thinking into applying for a md in the uk but this is n't realistically affordable for me . 
  well , off i go to germany/switzerland/netherlands . 
  it is incredible on how thin ice the relations are in europe . 
  someone farts and the porcelain set is broken . 
  this is true for almost any western european democracy . 
  more and more you see young people simply not caring about voting . 
  it is , however , in the interest that things are kept this way , at least in portugal , since these young fellows could bring disruption to the current psd/cds - ps duopoly . 
   rip in peace . 
  n1 m8 . 
  that was fast . 
  heh , that 's a lot of buzzwords . 
  lots of `` coulds '' `` shoulds '' and `` ifs '' . 
  with a `` relatively '' inserted in the most key part of text . 
  i almost gave you a pageview . 
  almost . 
   steal my dear troll . 
  vital moreira voted for ? 
  i bet he did n't even understand wtf it was about ... 
  he 's not greek . 
  he is portuguese . 
  haha this is awful . 
   it is about having less of stuff than others have . 
  then africans are relatively poor when compared to me . 
  they do n't have stuff that i have . 
  like housing or food . 
  wlololol have you actually read the interview in french ? 
  citizens are too busy to have critical thinking . 
  edit : i 'm not taking this phrase out-of-context , this is actually a stand alone phrase she said . 
   maybe it 's like the word `` gay '' , that only recently ( say , last 40 years ) became a synonym of `` faggot '' . 
  oh , you !, 
   oxford dictionary . 
  funny you say that . 
  i also happen to have a copy of an english dictionary by my side , also from oxford university press . 
  it is of course , not up to date ( it was bought some years ago ) but the first entry of mongrel is exactly the same as yours , however there is an interesting second entry , that states the following : * 2 . 
  ( derog sl ) a person of mixed descent * what do * derog * and * sl * keywords mean ? 
  a mistery , i say . 
  you can also check the definition at http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mongrel which is a site that is affiliated with oup . 
  from wikipedia [ mongrel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongrel ) : * among humans , a derogatory term for the mixing of races , known as miscegenation *  just because you have an emotional reaction to the word , that is your lack of testicular fortitude coming to the surface , not my fault . 
  hahahahahahaha . 
  i did n't invent them . 
  i do n't use them . 
  i am by no means accountable by what my ancestors did or what my countrymen do . 
  you , on the other hand , are accountable by what you are writing now ( limited , obviously , by how accountable things written on the internet are ) . 
  so a person that uses a very derogatory term for racial mixing , gets upvotes ? 
  i 'm not blond . 
  i 'm destroying the world 's economy and genetic diversity .
