  oh , you !, 
  drugs have been decriminalized in my country since i was twelve and i have n't done them once , what have i been doing ? 
  haha r/portugal 's best troll in r/europe . 
  welp . 
  this will not solve all the problems . 
  portugal still needs to change a lot of stuff . 
  were n't you using the french flag few days ago ? 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_krugman ) \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  carrefour left portugal before the subprime mortgage crisis . 
  that 's a short title right there . 
   socialists are adorable , are n't they ? 
  you 're adorable . 
  what is truly sad , is the fact that islamophobes are the ones that have to launch such debate , and the fact that they were , while obviously being hateful , not causing injury to anyone , just showing retarded caricatures . 
  all that matters is that the majority of muslims were level headed and ignored these guys . 
  this explains why my brain is toasted . 
  portugal , too , has nice beaches and islands . 
  * cough *, 
  `` portuguese are arabs '' : cripes :, 
  15/04/2013 - germany : eurozone would survive portuguese exit, 
  the same is written about portugal . 
  why does that matter ? 
  it 's just a comic show ... 
  what could possibly go wrong !, 
  so i read these guys want * landmines * in the border to avoid immigration ? 
  if hate means critic , then by all means label me a ` hater ' . 
  this . 
  this . 
  this . 
  this . 
  also those plastic cars with 50cc `` engines '' . 
  i hope so too . 
  it would critically endanger both european union and the freedom of movement . 
   it 's a blackmail situation , and it 's certainly not created by us , it 's created by you . 
  yeah ... we also coerced the banking system into those nasty loans . 
  we also coerced our way into the eurozone and the eu with who knows , our military and political might ( i 'm being sarcastic ) . 
   ok , why do you write this then ? 
  that sounds like complaining to me , and as i 've said before , go to the free market then . 
  it is n't complaining , it 's a statement of the facts . 
  i did n't say it was unfair , i did n't say it was wrong . 
  but the fact you think it is makes me wonder why i 'm wasting my time . 
  i find it hilarious that you 're so hungover the loans and consider them giving money , when they are n't , when you spent the last 20 years providing subsidies to `` southern europe '' , most of which i might add , were either badly managed or completely taken by some crooks . 
  i 'm fully aware ( far more than you will possibly be by the looks of it ) of the bad things that happen in `` southern europe '' since i know them first hand . 
  however , i know that both sides are equally guilty . 
  you , on the other hand , seem to think otherwise and i wo n't bother continuing this fruitless debate . 
  you 're missing my point . 
  i believe that the current imf deal benefits portugal more than the free market would . 
  what i am saying is , the only reason sweden and other countries are `` giving '' the money , it 's because it benefits them more than collapsing the economy and society of the `` southern europe '' . 
  which utterly defeats the purpose of gift . 
  what i am saying is that a loan from the imf and a loan from the free market are two completely different things . 
  so i once again say they 're both far from giving money . 
  the free market does n't mandate you to close hospitals , to close railways , to close schools , to raise taxes , etc , etc ( or if you prefer , `` the guilt free version '' : reduce state spending ) ... what you 're doing is n't charity . 
  i thought it was really cute when you wrote that you hoped that the money is being used to invest in science and technology . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's being used to pay the interest on the massive interest low duration loans we took in 2008-2011 and to pay the state bills . 
  that 's it . 
  imf did n't change their recipe from one day to the other . 
  then sweden is giving money to the imf . 
  i can give you my full assurance that imf sure as hell is n't giving money to portugal . 
   giving money [ giving ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gift ) [ loan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loan ) edit : format fail . 
  probably wo n't be able to afford a new car in the next years . 
  [ uefa euro 2012 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_2012 ) begins in june 8 ... out of your window unfortunately . 
  portuguese media call him `` primeiro-ministro espanhol '' which roughly translated means spanish prime-minister , hence my confusion . 
  is n't rajoy the prime-minister ? 
  83 % energy imports ?!, 
  what the psyduck are we ( portugal ) doing ? 
  that mans computer had a black screen with letters running about . 
  catch him !!, 
  the difference is enough for a portuguese 2nd-hand car salesman to do a deal with a spanish guy and sell the cars with a profit . 
  doubt it . 
  it 'll make buying cars in spain + paying the registration fee in portugal cheaper than buying it in portugal . 
  nope . 
  how convenient . 
   swearing is for weak minded persons http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rfgx8/i_wont_even_know_im_dead/c45hqp4, 
  in other news , applications for health inspectors spiked in ukraine . 
  it was a sarcastic statement . 
   `` tallinn seems to be one of the richest cities in the world , but for some reason its streets are filled with pot-holes and there is no money for kindergartens , '' meaning `` if we 're so rich to the point of offering free public transportation , how come we still have crumbling infrastructure ? 
  : okay :, 
  fine , why ? 
  we are not a super power . 
  natural rotation . 
   ... when it 's 100 % certain that the right person was caught ... suuuuure . 
  oh man , i love generalizations . 
  do you have some about the portuguese ? 
  to be honest , the * only * field right now that 's still recruiting aggressively in portugal is it . 
  taxes are bad m'kay ? 
  so we are cutting carbon emissions ( meaning closing coal plants ) and stopping nuclear ? 
  from where will the energy come from ? 
  it 's kind of normal actually . 
  last year there was a case that went on television of a man that had to return pensions he unfairly collected over a year , because his wife , that had some kind of incapacitating disease ( multiple sclerosis i think , not sure ) and therefore had a right to an invalidity pension , had died . 
  and the man thought that it was unfair . 
  this is the kind of mindset we ( in portugal ) have . 
  it 's wrong and it 'll take time and education to change . 
  not racist . 
  stereotyping is not racism , although both are stupid . 
  nope . 
  i find it over-hyped . 
  which is exactly what sensationalist is . 
  nice sensationalist title you have there . 
  we have cloning technology .
