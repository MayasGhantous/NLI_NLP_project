  lets use it for the greater good \u2122 . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'll never forgive myself for the crimes my ancestors did . 
  who am i to claim justice and equality when there is a high probability that one of my ancestors was a slaver ? 
  business as usual . 
  indeed . 
  i 'll edit it out . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  what i was trying to say is that companies are going bankrupt and used the word `` fired '' to describe what happens to the workers of said companies . 
  anyone who knows a little about portugal understands the hell that is to fire someone . 
  to be honest , the article nails one of the reasons ... we wanted to keep being the sweatshop of the eu while inside the euro . 
  we forgot the tiny little detail that we did n't control our currency anymore ( it allowed us to remain competitive because our money was worthless ) . 
  result , instead of dumping the the cheap model and pursuing either high-end technology industry or even higher quality textile industry we simply let it walk . 
  so , our industrial sector had to sell cheap and borrow money to keep going ( sane business model , right ?!, 
  now all those people that are employed in factories are being fired ( now that the credit fever fountain has dried the companies are going bankrupt ) , because there are other markets that sell cheaper . 
  edit : stupid orthographic error . 
  we asked for it . 
  do n't forget me !, 
  that 's wrong . 
  at least for our country . 
  do n't take his words for it . 
  jos\u00e9 socrates ( the previous pm ) also said that the country would never need financial assistance and the result is visible . 
  iranian state media sure knows it 's stuff . 
  portugal bought a negligible amount ( [ 6 % ] ( http://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt%2feconomia%2fpetroleo-irao-exportacoes-de-petroleo-oil-governo-ine%2f1325640-1730.html ) of total oil imports ) of iranian oil in 2010 and a whooping 0 % in 2011 , according to the national institute of statistics . 
  what 'll screw us are the rising prices , but that 's life . 
  5 degrees is already too cold for me . 
  `` they see extremely high levels of anti-jewish sentiment in parts of poland , hungary and portugal . '', 
  i do n't see anti-jewish sentiments anywhere in portugal . 
  actually , scratch that , i do n't see almost * anything jew-related , wether it 's pro or anti . 
  * except one or other very rare news item . 
  generalize situations then proceed to complain about generalizations . 
  also , greece thanks for your `` help '' burning those woods ( they were in the way , i 'm sure ) . 
  see what i did there ? 
  could n't get more clich\u00e9 than that ( this ) . 
  it 's the only thing i can do ( heh ) . 
  i 'm not nearly knowledgeable enough in economics to actually opinate about the topic ... 
  you contradict yourself . 
  first the republicans bashed europe because of our supposed `` elitism '' , now it 's a `` fundamental disagreement '' ? 
  mitt romney is also `` fundamentally '' against it , [ right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massachusetts_health_care_reform ) ? 
  my [ template ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/oap5i/socialism_and_welfare_us_republicans_bash_europe/c3fxmu7 ) and all its variants are freely available to all . 
  you got it wrong . 
  i did not write that portuguese never watch american tv , i wrote that public channels ( the ones that are freely available ) do not have american shows . 
  you have plenty of csi on premium cable . 
  again , i find it also hard to believe that the elitist atitude ( for you it seems elitist atitude , for me it seems just a little harmless banter ) is the root cause of the republican candidates rhetoric . 
  they are saying what the people want to hear . 
  that , my friend , is what we call [ demagogy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demagogy ) , and wether the candidate is american , british , danish , spanish , portuguese , etc. . . is irrelevant . 
  it is a short shighted idiot 's tool , no matter were you are and were you come from . 
  if you think that here in the europe subreddit we only make fun of american politicians , you 're wrong . 
  search other threads about sarkozy , cameron , merkel , barroso , rompuy and the one and only catherine ashton . 
  heck , sometimes we even make fun of each others countries . 
  you took what people wrote seriously and personally , which you should n't have . 
  that 's probably the objective ... 
  they 'll increase it to 70 and then to 75 ( as stated in the article ) , so that people have increasingly smaller time receiving pensions ... 
  i do n't think that cuts will be enough ... european countries need to step up with some real natality measures , it is shocking that in less than 40 years , portugal will have less 2m people if the current natality rates are kept at the same level . 
  you certainly make bold statements without proper backing , other than `` handful of danish people you 've met '' . 
  also , if you come to portugal hoping to see a lot of american television in the public channels , you 're in for a ** huge ** disappointment . 
  out of your last paragraph , only the first phrase is true . 
  the rest is just pr bullshit you feed yourself . 
  most likely , we 'll have to increase the retirement age . 
  this is the kind of comment that made me realize , after moving from x to y , the y-ans are just as < bad adjective  as x-ans . 
  here 's a template to make your generalizations easier . 
  guess u.k. is now southern europe . 
  welcome to hell boys . 
  are there any polls ? 
  i think it would be interesting to see the different positions of the scottish regarding this issue . 
  best : healthcare , wine , public transportation in oporto and lisbon , low crime rate . 
  worst : public transportation everywhere else , corruption ( justice , politics , sports ... could keep going forever ) , labour laws , media in general , tax delivery system ( fix this shit now !, 
  46/47 . . forgot monaco , i 'm sorry my monegasque friends :(, 
  time to kill some spanish . 
  nope . 
  vitoria-gasteiz is now the capital of spain . 
  irrelevant . 
  that 's a % of gdp . 
  you are speaking about an economic situation you know almost nothing about and , obviously , are jumping to wrong conclusions . 
  the portuguese economic problems did not spawn from the healthcare spending or even military and education spending for that matter . 
  the reasons are far more deep than that . 
  i made a post about it not so long ago , but believe me when i tell you that portuguese healthcare is actually one of the few decent things this country has . 
  the portuguese problem if you want a tl ; dr version the causes are basically these : badly planned public works ( railways , highways , you name it ) , heavy corruption in the state , a whooping 30 % of gdp in tax evasion and the labour laws . 
  public healthcare can not be afforded ? 
  imagine if we had a majorly private healthcare system like the u.s. before 2008 . 
  they had a public expenditure of 15 % of the gdp before the obama reforms ( now probably more ) , while the u.k. , france , germany and other countries with the demonic public healthcare ( including ... 
  portugal ! ), 
  in europe had no more than 11 % ( france being the top spender with 11 % in 2007 statistics ) . 
  source : [ oecd ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=sha ), 
  in your country it might be different , but universities in portugal are awarding the msc to `` old bsc '' graduates with 1 of the 2 following conditions : either show 5 years of professional experience , or do a master 's thesis ( 1 semester ) . 
  you just inserted a lower tier . 
  the old bsc still has the same value . 
  the equivalent degree ( bolonha msc ) is still the same difficulty . 
  exactly . 
  why is that a problem ? 
  then that was a choice of your university . 
  i 'm in a compsci course in portugal and the new 3 +2 bolonha course is almost the same as the old 5 year bsc . 
  there are a few differences of course ( i.e. 
  : they crunched 4 calculus courses into 3 ( still the same content ) , some names were changed and we 're awarded an bsc diploma after 3 years , not 5 ) . 
  how unoriginal . 
  i thought this was a regular situation ... portuguese expats already have their own mps ( 4 in 230 ) . 
  i guess the usa flag flair was n't obvious enough to the fact that he does n't need acceptance as a german . 
  i dunno if it is reliable but : http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=ine&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indocorrcod=0005599&amp;seltab=tab0 . 
  for portuguese unemployment . 
  hmm what does that mean ?
