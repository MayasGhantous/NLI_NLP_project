  who lost a huge part of their autonomy ? 
   richelieu intrigued to make an alliance and ties when the principality revolted . 
  he did n't control the will of the populace , the bad management by royal officers of the situation , the tercios rampaging and pillaging half mad or the insane reaction of the court in madrid . 
  intriguing is a way of inciting . 
   so tell me again after explaining me historical facts that i already know , your legitimacy comes from having kissed some english ass and being then more powerful then than catalonia ? 
  exactly !, 
  catalonia kissed louis ' ass and got curb stomped , portugal kissed louis ' ass ** and ** licked charles ' balls and got to live another day . 
  17th century geopolitics worked this way . 
  regardless of any ass kissing or ball licking , in the end portugal was still stronger than catalonia , any day . 
   that is what guarantees your right to sovereignty ? 
  back in the day ? 
  yep . 
  today ? 
  nope . 
   and the rest . 
  if by chance , decision or faults lost we should shut up and let spain assimilate us ? 
  wow , what double standards that you have there sir . 
   and no , without the circumstantial situation of the hispanic crown ( and our revolt ) you would likely have been crushed . 
  not really . 
  ** catalonia was crushed ** . 
  again , if anyone is to be thanked , the french are on top of the list and following them the english . 
   good for you guys , in general i respect and admire portugal . 
  i do n't tolerate however that you think you have more right for succeeding in your task , things could have gone easily other ways in history . 
  what in the flying fuck are you writing about ? 
   you were independent because some bloke from madrid chose to prioritise and spend resources to the principality of catalonia instead of portugal . 
  be grateful . 
  not really . 
  i 'd say with was more from the fact that spain was fighting france ( both the catalan revolt and the portuguese restoration war were partially incited by richelieu ) and the fact that portugal was stronger at the time than catalonia ( portugal had a standing army , a navy , several colonies from which tax and troops could be withdrawn to feed the war , while catalonia had a militia and french military support ) . 
  it was no cakewalk though , portugal was warring with spain and indirectly with the dutch . 
  it had to fight off both the dutch overseas and spain in the iberian peninsula . 
  when france eventually bailed out on portugal and catalonia , it betrayed both and signed a treaty that chopped catalonia in two and stated that phillip iii ( or iv ) was king of portugal . 
  we still had to withstand ten years of war between the end of the catalan revolt and the recognition of sovereign from spain . 
  that makes no sense . 
  there is a far more clear political , historical , cultural and geographic transition ( or , in this case , continuity ) in iberian kindgoms -  kingdom of spain , than some celtic tribe thousands of years ago -  switzerland . 
  i 'm not the one getting serious over a joke m8 . 
  let me bold the important part for you  the only sovereign state in the iberian peninsula that successfully permanently seceded from the kingdom of spain ( ** in our case , one of its precursors ** ) . 
  firstly it is a stupid joke . 
  high chance of not being historically accurate ( what a shocker ) . 
  secondly we were not a kingdom in the beginning , we were a county ( a vassalage ) and we seceded from the kingdom of asturias , galicia and le\u00f3n making us the only sovereign state in the iberian peninsula that successfully permanently seceded from the kingdom of spain ( in our case , one of its precursors ) . 
  edit : derp derp do n't write the kingdom names in portuguese stupeed . 
  we were independent from spain before it was cool . 
  edit : let it be stated on record that i fully support the right of the catalan people for self-determination , this lame joke is a mere attempt at harvesting the very important imaginary reddit points , so that they can be wasted on future occasions where i want to express controversial or unpopular opinions . 
   europe does n't give a shit about us . 
  welcome to the club . 
   if they start to force people to learn languages or leave ( okay not exactly what is happening but people will see it like that ) it 's not the spanish government that is telling people to learn the native language ... 
  it 's the british government , possibly because they want the embassy to stop being a glorified translation service for those retirees . 
  so the embassy in portugal does the same ? 
   greece has been signing billion dollar deals with china for wine and organic food recently . 
  please give me a citation . 
  those are indeed excellent deals . 
   there is supposedly a greek food craze going on at the moment there . 
  i do not think so . 
   there are dozens of food products that greece has that are criminally non-marketed , i am talking about wines that are as good as anything made on earth but on the label all you see is a puzzle of greek letters and no english which means non-greeks will have no clue what it is or where it came from . 
  there are countless products like this , not just wine i really hope they work on marketing this stuff better like the rest of southern europe ? 
  only france truly markets its agricultural products well ... 
  last time i went there ( 2011 ) they had border checks . 
  italy is almost an island . 
  last one out turns off the light . 
  yes . 
  `` t\u00eam '' is the informal 2nd person plural i.e : `` voc\u00eas t\u00eam '' , `` tem '' is the formal 2nd person singular or the 3rd person singular ( in ops context , it is the former ) i.e : `` voc\u00ea tem '' ( third person case is : `` ele/ela tem '' ) . 
  they are also spoken differently , `` t\u00eam '' is a long `` e '' , `` tem '' is a short `` e '' . 
  it is irrelevant . 
  because both * real politik * and * geo politics * are vague as fuck . 
  there is nothing meaningful to discuss because there is no real , tangible information . 
  you are simply debating whose extrapolations are better . 
  attention : irrelevant military discussion in this comment thread . 
  do not read . 
   why do x politicians tend to fearmonger when faced with y ? 
  ftfy . 
  your question should be : why do they have to resort to such tactics in the first place ? 
   i was referring to the political background of the currently incumbent president of the european council , but you obviously did n't catch my reference . 
   you do n't seem to know much do you ? 
  i mean , other than empty slogans ... van rompuy has always been a christian democrat . 
  you surely did not mean dur\u00e3o barroso , since he is the ** president of the european comission ** . 
  cdu are commies + greens , fyi . 
  i can point you to some retarded portuguese blogs that state similar things if you want to keep that feeling of ~ righteousness ~ . 
  your language is evolving . 
  h is the j. 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ dealwithit, 
   but i also like autumn . 
  summer pls return, 
  why ? 
  before the deal -  american ip was not respected in portugal and vice-versa ; after the deal -  american ip is respected in portugal under portuguese law and portuguese ip is respected in the us under us law . 
  win-win . 
   us is n't obliged to make those distinctions when dealing with outside entities . 
  the same applies to portugal . 
  american ip is valid in portugal with a condition , it is done so under the portuguese law . 
  that 's the deal we signed . 
   and these agreements work tit for tat ok . americans can share portuguese ip for non-commercial purposes . 
  it 's completely fine . 
   us is n't somehow obliged to respect the convoluted nonsensical reasoning for the distinctions you want to introduce . 
  non-commercial use and commercial use are very clear and logical distinctions . 
  these distinctions are also present in the u.s. so i do n't really get what your problem is , once again . 
   legalized wholesale unlicensed use of any ip doing that is still illegal in portugal , so i do not understand what is your problem . 
  do n't let these nasty euros get ya, 
  we can do those things online too ( in portugal ) . 
  only people that either distrust or ca n't use the internet use atms nowadays . 
   other countries have analogous patterns ( spain like greece and italy like portugal ) , but i choose this two cases because they seem the more extreme to me . 
  from what i can see it is the opposite . 
  you see an increase and then a decrease in both italy and greece , while you see an increase and then a stagnation for portugal and spain ( with opposite tendencies though ) .
