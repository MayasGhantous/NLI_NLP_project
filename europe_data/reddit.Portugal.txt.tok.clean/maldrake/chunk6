  also : portugal # 1 poorest piigs country ( so proud ), 
  yes , they do . 
  not only from the treaties with the eu but with pretty much all other international organizations they belong to . 
  i can send a postcard from either vila de cascais or from lisbon proper . 
  pm with your address and preference . 
   and would europeans be in favour the president of the european commission being elected directly in the near future ? 
  seven out of ten say clearly and unambiguously that they would . 
  why ? 
  because they feel that this would give eu decisions added legitimacy and would strengthen democracy in the eu . 
  please let someone interpret this as a message . 
  cabr\u00e3o - motherfucker . 
  cabra de merda - shitty bitch ( literally ) , fucking bitch . 
  ( not recommended in a friendly setting ) filho da puta - son of a bitch . 
  vai-te foder - go fuck yourself . 
  vai para o caralho - go to the cock ( literally ) , go fuck yourself or go suck a dick . 
  volta/vai para a puta que te pariu - back/go to the bitch that bore you ( literally ) , go fuck yourself . 
  ( not recommended in a friendly setting ) edit : these are nasty things to say to someone . 
  expect a punch to the teeth . 
  it was probably bullshit . 
  i was just ironically repeating the mantra everyone says . 
  however , your troll is just too good to be ignored ...  with the tap ( trans-adriatic pipeline ) awarding greece as the new energy hub of the eu it 's just a pipeline . 
   gas/oil drilling set to begin in greek waters around 2018 with a potential of 10 + trillion $ in profits . 
  so , huh , you have more than 1/7 of the current gross world product in oil and gas ? 
  please tell me more about it . 
   organic food industry/tourism industry/shipping/etc all trending upwards and getting more popular every year . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  it 's common in portugal too .

  do n't forget minipre\u00e7o belongs to dia , a spanish corporation . 
  that difference is also present in other european countries . 
  why are you limiting it to eastern europeans only ? 
  maybe there is no infrastructure or companies that support recycling ... 
  i do n't really know , there might be a load of reasons . 
  any of the blue and white flags that are in [ wikabebia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_portugal ) ? 
  republicans were like : how can we distance ourselves further from the monarchy ? 
  someone said : let 's change the current kinda cool flag to one with the colours of the republican party , therefore making it as ugly and retarded as possible !, 
  everyone : yay , we 're not a monarchy !, 
  i 'll remember to say that next time i remove my shoes in heathrow . 
  holy fuck you lived really close to a friend of mine ( he lives in rua das alca\u00e7arias ) . 
  if you believe in the notion of `` bitches '' in the eu , then i do not know what else can i write ... 
   well having a masters in economics i have a masters in awesome . 
   spain is still europe 's little bitch what does this even mean , jesuschristareyoudumb, 
   considering you 're from portugal i can see how you feel that way . 
  i know . 
  trust me , it 'll be tough at the beginning , but then you 'll get over it and accept it peacefully . 
   want to tell you that your language sounds f * cking amazing to me [ like some wicked hybrid of spanish and russian , and that 's a compliment ! ], 
  everyone says that . 
  my laymans guess is that when we speak standard european portuguese , we drop a lot of vowels , making it hard to understand when compared to the high pitched , musical vowels of brazillian portuguese and spanish . 
  a good example i found on the internet :  written : excelente  it sounds like  1 . eh-seh-lehn-tchee in brazilian portuguese ( 4 syllables ) 2 . shlent in continental portuguese ( 1 syllable ) the portuguese-brazillian situation is funny , because the spoken language is very different , while the written language is basically the same and 100 % inteligible . 
  edit : too much `` whiles '' in there . 
  good job !, 
   to arms and ... to arms and ** barons highlighted **  we will pass ... we will pass beyond [ taprobane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taprobane_island ) ( probably meant sri lanka )  forced ( ? ), 
  through dangers and wars * strained * through dangers and wars , though your version is not incorrect . 
  ( in this particular context , it should mean overcoming ) * esfor\u00e7ar * means to strain while * for\u00e7ar * means to force . 
   and among ... people we will build remota = remote . 
  all in all you understood it pretty well . 
  much better than my understanding of romanian !, 
  decent try !, 
  if you pass it through google translate you might get an idea . 
  / u/un _ om_de_cal almost had it . 
   spain is irrelevant now . 
  are n't we all ? 
  they are under british sovereign . 
  this is not debatable . 
  [ it is on the first page of their constituiton ] ( http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/gibraltar_constitution_order_2006.pdf ) . 
  you beat me to it , i was going to say / u/salvaxe the same thing . 
  you do n't need to go that far , gibraltar states that it is under british sovereign several times in their constitution ( [ directly in the very first page ] ( http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/constitution/gibraltar_constitution_order_2006.pdf ) , indirectly several times ) . 
  edit : now with sauce . 
  although i am always very sceptic about these things ( mainly until we get word from the national institute of statistics , our national hope killer ) , please note that the second quarter is not considered high season . 
  portugal ( possibly ) # 1 inverted positive gdp growth chart on the second quarter of 2013 . 
  well , i undoubtedly agree that the purpose of the loans are somewhat self-serving , but they 're loaning us money with interest rates few would . 
  so , huh , you wanted them to give us money for free ? 
   please note : that we have n't included expenses , just base salary . 
  of course there are some very substantial perks at work for some of these politicians . 
  this right here , is why portuguese mps are so low on the list . 
  they have a shitload of paid expenses ( transportation , food , house ) . 
  my country is named after a city . 
  i can deal with it . 
   magadget was clearly hoping the train was owned by a ** public ** operator so he could make some juicy political hay out of the deaths of 78 people . 
  why did you have to go and disappoint him ? 
  see how this works ? 
  check / u/radaway 's comment for futher enlightment . 
  they probably use alternative social networks . 
  is that a picture of merkel fistpumping ? 
  so i 'm an underwater terror ?
