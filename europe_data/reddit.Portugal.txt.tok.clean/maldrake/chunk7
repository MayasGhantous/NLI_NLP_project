  to be honest , it is hard to justify the common person investment in 4g ( even though the coverage is good ) because our 3g infrastructure is awesome ... 
  i can get 15mbps + with 3g pretty much everywhere i usually go in portugal ( even in northeast portugal and alentejo ) . 
   in this article , `` xenophobia '' refers to any political platform that calls for the strict limitation of immigration , strengthened border controls , the reform or abolition of the schengen zone , or even the expulsion of minorities . 
  cds/pp does n't fit that category . 
  the last time they spoke about immigration was in 2008 ( that i recall ) , and it was a complaint about how portugal takes too much time deporting non-national criminals . 
  genius . 
  i thought this was an exit . 
  is it a joke ? 
  i come from portugal , these kind of mistakes usually are n't on purpose , just lack of google translate . 
  what the hell ? 
  for me `` auf wiedersehen '' is one of the most iconic german phrases . 
  edit : accidentally a space . 
  what a shocker . 
  you are absolutely right , i mistook the concepts . 
  voting is tied to citizenship . 
  at least in portugal . 
  i can see the headlines in portugal in a few weeks :  portugal has its own prism-like intelligence gathering program , but it does n't work , contractors ran away with the money, 
  i can not speak for the other countries but an apt analogy for portugal would be saying you 're disappointed that a soldier armed with a folded newspaper did not charge a fortified machine gun nest . 
  welp . 
  we can all start running in panic like headless chickens now . 
  edit : too many `` n 's '' in running . 
  edit2 : see bellow . 
  so that he would stay in austria and achieve the masterplan !, 
  ( i am joking ), 
  [ what if they wanted kurt waldheim elected all along ? 
   not that they used it in a good way ... 
  i 'm genuinely curious about what `` good '' means . 
  this map says that portugal was both efficient ( low waste ) and effective ( expected results achieved ) at using the funds . 
  since eu funds are concretely targeted to specific areas , i interpreted that the funds were well used . 
   i know you 're esl but cmon . 
  it is ironic you say that , because you 're the one who seems unable to read english . 
  the rules are clear as water .

  / u/shuai 's comment :  this downvote was delivered to you straight from copenhagen for your bitchy edit  your edit :  edit : downvoted for a personal opinion/experience on a thread calling purely for personal opinions/experiences , whilst you upvote a guy for saying 3 words ; stay classy / r/europe . 
  so portugal has been really efficient and effective at allocating european funds , more so than germany ( and sweden , finland , netherlands , etc. . ) ? 
  i 'm a little bit sceptic about that . 
  share your internet !, 
   edit : downvoted for a personal opinion/experience on a thread calling purely for personal opinions/experiences , whilst you upvote a guy for saying 3 words ; stay classy / r/europe [ 1 ] . 
  holy shit are you people allergic to downvotes or what ?!, 
  did n't you read rediquette ? 
  never not make incorrect correlations . 
  great start . 
  because you can use your nexus in your country . 
  i 'm not the op man . 
   and how would being french save her money then ? 
  she would be considered a home student and would pay smaller tuition fees . 
  do n't forget about `` o crime '' , `` o diabo '' and the sports newspapers . 
  he is portuguese . 
  in hamburg , only 1.5 % of the houses are vacant ? 
  looks really expensive . 
   edit : reddiquette , people . 
  will do !, 
   downvoted for having a different opinion . 
  you 're aware that you 're not following rediquette , right ? 
   which states have higher taxes in europe ? 
  the scandinavians . 
  which states have the better economy ? 
  the scandinavian . 
  which states in europe have the lower taxes ? 
  states like spain , portugal and greece . 
  how is their economy ? 
  bad . 
  case closed . 
  this line of thought is flawed . 
  just expand the case to either a bigger european context or between the countries that are in crisis themselves to see that your logic does n't apply . 
  oh man , i ca n't wait for the next portugal or piigs article so i can whine too !, 
  i was in the interior of iberia once and it was awful . 
  there 's a lot of empty space in extremadura and alentejo . 
   i 'm surprised our parliament is still standing and a full scale revolution has n't happened over these last few years . 
  people wo n't move their asses and create alternative parties , much less a regime change . 
  besides , where would the revolution be ? 
  our problem is not the democratic system . 
  dat negative number , so sexy . 
  in a twisted way they are . 
  if one of them adopts as a single parent , they can apply to co-adopt , making them de facto gay parents . 
  they all have crosses , if you look closely . 
  hehehehehe so witty ~, 
   what 's that sound in the distance ? 
  i think it 's your worldview just coming crashing down around you as ideology meets economic reality , once more confirming that reality does indeed have a liberal bias , as you americans like to say . 
  you actually proved a part of his point with that link , haha . 
  are you sure you want to be evaluated on the same scale as two shit-tier european countries ? 
  why ?!, 
  i can see several reasons for why our electricity is expensive . 
  overproduction is not one of them . 
  i certainly hope so . 
  i ca n't repeat enough , having an economic power-house on your doorstep on a free trade zone can only bring good tiems . 
  some people just want to see the world burn . 
  incoming : another shitposting party . 
  this thread is shit and you should all feel bad . 
  actually the companies that incurred in most losses last year were , funnily enough , both the metros and the airline .
