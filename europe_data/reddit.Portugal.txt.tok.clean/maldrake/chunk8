  they were responsible for almost 90 % of the loss public companies made ( yes , estradas de portugal made a profit , i 'm shocked too ) . 
  of our transportation companies , the only ones that have new shit are the two metro companies and the airline , and they 're indebted into oblivion . 
  the only privatizations i see in the near future are of ana and ctt , and that 's because they 're highly profitable companies ( and we will sell them horribly because we are in a shitty position ) . 
  the others no sane person would want to buy : well , there was actually one guy that came for tap ... 
  he was a crook . 
  cp pretty much only has decrepit , shitty infrastructure ( except stations , we have beautiful stations kekekekekeke ) and debts . 
  no one wants to get into the tv business in portugal ( fifth channel ? ) . 
  to the radios `` lol '' is pretty much what i have to say . 
  the only solution i see is closure . 
  tl ; dr - we 're fucked . 
  i highly doubt we will make ** any ** profit in privatizations . 
   i say it 's about time we privatise the public tv and radio stations , the public airline , the public transportation systems , no one wants to buy shit . 
  i told you so . 
  you 'll find a hard time finding `` heart '' in european capital cities . 
  they 're usually very densely populated , like american cities in general . 
  if you want to relax , i 'd point you to the alps or the french countryside . 
  i specially enjoyed the time i spent near the pyrenees ( i really liked toulouse , though it is a densely populated city ) . 
  government collapse ? 
  haha , you wish . 
  the ruling coalition probably knew that the constitutional court would reject some of the measures . 
  last year the same happened and they used it as an excuse to raise taxes for everyone ( the constitutional court rejected that only the public workers holiday and christmas subsidy was taxed , something similar happened this year too ) . 
  though i do n't think they 'll do the same this year , they 'll probably cut on health and education , because taxes are already too high for our income . 
  mutual debt can only have any sense if there is an elected , european but country independent body that allocates and supervises the money . 
  any other solution is dumb and will be politically impossible . 
   cheap tacos . 
  we can get mexican food , but only in real restaurants i.e. 
  expensive . 
  i agree . 
  i 've only had expensive tacos in fancy mexican restaurants over here . 
  i would like to try taco bell or something like that at least once . 
  please make it so , we need to export , kkthx, 
  that 's really cheap and well bellow the eu27 average . 
  i 'd say rather than portugal being expensive , it is ukraine that has cheap electricity . 
   is daily cost summed with the cost of consumed electricity ? 
  yes . 
   at a first glance tariffs sound kind of expensive ... those prices do n't have the ren ( infrastructure management ) and erse ( regulating body ) tariffs . 
  notice , by the way , the striking similarity between the prices . 
  here is the pricing used by 3 of the major electricity players . 
  [ edp ] ( https://energia.edp.pt/particulares/eletricidade/casa/tarifarios.aspx ) , [ galp ] ( http://www.galpenergia.com/pt/produtosservicos/gasnatural/mercado-livre/residencial/documents/monofolha_eletricidade.pdf ) and [ iberdrola ] ( http://www.iberdrola.pt/02sicb/corporativa/iberdrola?idpag=ptwcoibreleplacs ) . 
  the total power supplied to you is given in kva and the price is decided in two ways , firstly the daily cost of the supplied power ( given in the column that says $ / dia ) and secondly the cost of used power ( given in the column with $ / kwh ) . 
  when one speaks of leaving the $ , default ( or a ** big ** haircut ) is implied . 
   surely your businesses make use of banks to store their revenues that 's the sad part . 
  there will be minimal capital flight from portugal , because no one invested here in the `` gud tiemz '' , so there is literally no capital to begin with . 
  16 \u00bac and rain in lisbon . 
  it 's pretty normal weather for this time of the year . 
  there is no thing as nationality then , as far as trust or equality is ( are ? ), 
  concerned . 
   they are not your family and the ties are only of water , not blood . 
  this example is actually funny since i have more non-portuguese born relatives than portuguese , even though i 've lived all my life in portugal . 
  they 're free to elect politicians that are n't influenced by those countries interests , then . 
  i ca n't stop repeating this but , you know that the fact your post has more upvotes than downvotes is , by itself , a clear indication of how some people do not understand reddits voting mechanism . 
  if you need to take your money out of italy , you might as well say europe . 
  17 \u00bac in lisbon . 
  / u/syndane probably made the connection between barroso and maoism because barroso was a member , in his youth , of [ pctp/mrpp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_workers'_communist_party ) , which is a maoist party . 
  oh please . 
  barroso is just a pathetic muppet . 
  why would anyone throw a party with other countries ' demise ? 
  we 're not enemies . 
  you ca n't win . 
  what are you implying with that shitty fable ? 
  well , something will be done one way or the other . 
  i just hope it is n't done too late ( `` late '' meaning before bee populations are negatively affected to the point of no return ) . 
  not all politicians are elected . 
  portuguese only knew v\u00edtor gaspar was going to be the finance minister * after * passos coelho was elected . 
  there is no possible way i can read greek , in this day and age . 
   * and keep the cold fusion technology strictly european * . 
  what !? 
  why !, 
  so what would you do ? 
  but , but , i thought my countries geniuses were the best ... 
  come spain , join the dark side of republicanism . 
  officially , in school and in news outlets we use `` pa\u00edses baixos '' . 
  in day to day we use `` holanda '' . 
  i also use `` holanda '' , it 's simpler . 
   true , i ca n't believe that people ruin the life of someone else by taking a job below x wage decided by a bunch of bureaucrats . 
  exactly . 
   implying that murder and working below a random number for all jobs and ages are the same thing ... 
  son do n't go full retard on me please ... no , but implying that laws that are broken should not exist is far more sane . 
   no , these are the consequences of a law that is inherently bad and against human freedom . 
  so you say . 
   people do n't want to work outside the law where they are far easier to exploit , yet if you push them into a position where they have no choice but do so they will . 
  sadly more and more people find themselves working in the black market because of how bad things are getting . 
  again , just because there are people willing to operate outside the law does n't make the law dumb . 
   i could tolerate minimum wage brats like you when the cows where fat , but now this shit is getting way out of hand and you 're acting like a donkey who wo n't move even when it 's clear that you 're wrong . 
  huehueheuheuheuhe  i guess you rather have people stay at home wasting their time when they could be productive members of society and earning their keep . 
  brilliant plan !, 
  create a class of people who do n't develop their skills and instead are reliant on the rest of society !, 
  it 's almost like you 're twisting the incentives to work harder and become more productive to earn more and instead creating an environment where you 're better off not working , huh ? 
  so your solution is to that is having more people reliant on social help ? 
  it essentially is the same . 
  you had 3 guys that paid more taxes and had less social support and one guy who was relying on the state , now you have 4 guys that pay less taxes than those 3 and rely more on the state than the other 3 , all this so that the other unemployed guy could feel productive . 
  good job . 
   i could n't be such a condescending prick even if i tried , congratulations !, 
  the mere fact that you think what i said was condescending tells a lot about the state of our society . 
   doing jack shit at home while feeling worthless must be far higher-skilled . 
  like i said , he can always volunteer . 
  no one is keeping him at home . 
   well who are you to tell someone that they ca n't sell their labour for the price they choose ? 
  who am i to tell people that they 're criminals ? 
  who am i to judge murders ?
