  who am i to say that people should n't smoke ? 
  who am i to say that you should n't run a nuclear reactor in your backyard ? 
  who am i to say that you should n't piss on the streets ? 
  who am i to say that you should n't spank your child ? 
   besides being paternalistic you 're being foolish in believing that you can stop people from doing what they want . 
  outlawing murder is n't keeping people from commiting it , better decriminalize it . 
   more and more people are working below the minimum wage in the black market , this is money that is going untaxed and by forcing people to go outside the law you put them in a spot where they have far less rights than if the minimum wage was abolished and they where legally working . 
  so because a law is badly applied makes that same law incorrect ? 
  genious , i can see the possibilities !, 
   cheaper products wrong . 
  the minimum wage bracket is too small to make market changes . 
   more taxable income haha , are you serious ? 
   less social spending on unemployment so , huh , more social spending on low wage employees ? 
   people working and developing their skills low-skilled .

   instead of staying at home feeling useless and increasingly revolted . 
  they can always do volunteer work . 
  the parishes and municipalities always need help . 
   in one case you have a guy whose skills are being wasted .

   it 's the argument krattr presented and that i 'm trying to deconstruct . 
  i just merely pointed that you were wrong in one of your arguments . 
   to promote a minimum wage is to say you 're against the employment of these people . 
  to promote a minimum wage is to say that i want a reasonable amount of money paid to a low-skilled worker . 
  just because someone is willing to slave themselves off ( : toot : hyperbole : toot  , does n't mean they should . 
   what do you mean with it 's not worth it ? 
  what exactly will be lost ? 
  lower average wages , lower wages per worker , social unrest and these are not even the full package you 'll get . 
   are you saying employment is n't necessarily good for the economy ? 
  yes , yes i am , at least at the wage bracket we 're talking about . 
  what is the difference between 3 guys getting 400 $ with moderate social support and 1 unemployed guy getting full social support to 4 guys getting 300 $ and high social support ? 
  well , better stats . 
  that 's it . 
  state pays the same , employer pays the same , no more money gets into the economy . 
   that 's so absolutely retarded , it 's mindboggling . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it is a quite reasonable way of seeing things . 
   limiting employment conditions limits employment , ** you have to be an idiot that unemployment will ever be reduced by raising the minimum wage . 
  ** where did i write that again ? 
   like laws ? 
  the minimum wage is a law and it fosters unemployment . 
  ok , replace `` like laws '' with `` like other laws '' . 
   but that does n't diminish the role of the minimum wage specially on younger groups or immigrants . 
   `` hey , why should we bother , it 's not like we have an unemployment rate of 16 % and of 39 % for people under 25 years ! '', 
  my point is that there is little difference . 
  you wo n't see a boom in employment if you abolish minimum wages . 
  the costs of abolishing it are not worth the little statistical decrease they 'll bring . 
  besides we can agree that more employment = / = better economy , or then the good ol' soviet union would 've been a paradise . 
   we 're talking about the economy here , there 's no single variable that accounts for unemployment . 
  exactly my point . 
  there are so many variables at play , that assuming a correlation based in one of them is fundamentally flawed . 
   i never said it did n't , though to ignore the impact of the minimum wage upon it is outright foolish . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it is literally irrelevant , when compared with other data points ( like laws and taxation ) . 
  minimum wage is the proverbial drop in the ocean . 
  it is meaningless . 
  yes . 
  if by ` last year ' you mean 2012 . 
  although total expenditure has been dropping since 2010 , 2012 was the first year in which the troika had an input on the government budget . 
   do you see the correlation ? 
  huh , nope . 
  netherlands has the third highest minimum wage and is the second country with less youth unemployment . 
  italy , cyprus and macedonia have no minimum wage yet their youth unemployment rates are pretty high ( particularly in macedonia ) . 
  looking at it , the general economical/social situation ( particularly the strict labour laws ) has far more importance in the general outlook of the job market . 
  we were not practicing austerity on those years . 
  hey let me complain about the circlejerk on reddit . 
  maybe this time it 'll work !, 
  you would n't invest in one of the most powerful economies in the world ? 
  lead the way . 
  i 'd say roller hockey , basketball , volleyball and rugby . 
  no thanks . 
  i certainly hope that this is n't just another scheme to implement shit like acta . 
   you can have customers in the eu without any kind of physical presence at all . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  i did not think that through . 
   you can also do things like hire contractors without a physical presence . 
  if running these services is n't profitable due to regulations , how can contractors make it so ? 
   it 's even more simple in this case as with many of the companies that track users ( not google/facebook , i 'm talking about ones you 'll never hear of unless you 're in the industry ) all you are is a visit to the website in the form of a javascript load or a pixel ... to whom do they sell that info ? 
   and i do n't think there 's much debate around the idea you do n't need a physical eu presence to have one of their citizens visit your website .
