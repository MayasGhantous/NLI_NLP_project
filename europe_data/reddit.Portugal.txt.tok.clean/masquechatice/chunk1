shit is gone hit the fan ... again ... 
  how stupid can it get ? 
  yeahh right ... 
  yes ... pastors here is not in a priest sense, 
   ** in international waters **, 
  what a mess ! ... 
  france is ruled from the streets ... what else is new ? 
  ... french elites are afraid of being burned at the stick , like during the `` la revolution '' , for not give in to street pressure ... is not destined to end well i think . 
  ** now that \u00b4 s talking ** ... don \u00b4 t like the rules ... leave please ... and renegotiate commercial agreements ... ehehehe, 
   comes out of the fight fully intact and with its head held high pride ... one of the seven deadly sins !, 
  strikes me the violent stand from putin ... the author could be using the cult propaganda to get pass the regime , this cult is something they like , to reveal a violent stand in russian foreign affairs , when the same regime tries to pass the idea that there is no war with ukraine . 
  people buy this shit ? 
  bullshit ... russia doesn \u00b4 t represent nothing except mafia , corruption and decadent technology ... russia isn \u00b4 t capable of leading anything besides their own controlled country, 
  i hope you grow old and your stupidity doesn \u00b4 t kill you ... so you can look back one day and realize `` how fucking stupid you where '' you \u00b4 r enemy is russia ... and is using you to pass her agenda on the region ... 
  the things you say look like coming from a horror movie , those horror movies made with oldfashion cameras , low bugdet and distasteful actors ... like those second division russian mobster movies . 
  you should seek help , mental help for disturbed people . 
  the `` brave forces '' are thugs and assassins ... but i guess that is just normal in russian elites . 
  auch ... that \u00b4 s got ta hurt, 
  nato military is far superior to kremlin military in numbers and technology ... this is conventional forces , tanks , planes , troops ... how can you say this is irrelevant ? 
  conclusion : russia can \u00b4 t afford to lose his european customer \u00b4 s on this . 
  just don \u00b4 t pay them all the gas at once ... to show russia who \u00b4 s the boss, 
  sure keep dreaming if you think that bunch of fags running russia now can hold that vast amount of land for their own pleasure . 
  china in one side with is vast amounts of people , west in the other with economic sanctions , and russia in the middles with is vast amounts of natural resources , independence fighting regions , and an economic and industrial sector unable to respond to this country needs , basically needing help from outside to extract and produce oil from siberia from instance ; just sit back and enjoy the show ... `` russia \u00b4 s dance with the death . '', 
  yeah ... spain sucks ... that \u00b4 s why it needs to be dismantled , by dividing it into smaller regions . 
  ** edit : ** they still have kings for god \u00b4 s sake !, 
  how can you expect that russian or any other country by that instance to have normal and prosperous relations with other countries ? 
  in the case of russia this can have implications in other internal regions gaining self determination . 
  not under international law, 
   just because you do n't like it does n't make it not true . 
  is not because i don \u00b4 t like it ... dickhead ... it \u00b4 s because is not recognized by any country except russia, 
   does anybody seriously think it will ever be declared ukranian again ? 
  yes . 
  when russia falls apart . 
  humm ... so it would be something between portugal and russia with none other country intervention ... sounds like a reasonable scenario, 
  what would happen if they `` accidently '' where shot down in portuguese air space ? 
   russia is a pioneer in military/aerospace technology . 
  i know , my point was ... russia \u00b4 s planes in portuguese airspace was to send the message that even the western part of europe is reachable to russia air force . 
  i was joking for them showing their planes here . 
  seems to me that russian strategy to keep nato away from russian borders is working very well ... !, 
  wow ... russians already have planes ? 
  ... that \u00b4 s pretty good ... keep up the good work . 
  in your dreams maybe, 
  is good to know that the money stolen from tax payer and stacked in luxembourg banks , is well managed by luxembourg authorities, 
  close the city and then we can talk about foot the bill, 
  i see ... british divert tactics is gaining followers ... 
  it \u00b4 s the french ... protectionism, 
  i see your point ... but that is lobbying in a board sense ... it \u00b4 s just russia forcing his agenda , is very questionable that it can go trough, 
  doing nothing ... ussr was destined to fail , it was only a matter of time . 
  i don \u00b4 t get it . 
  how can russia make the eu fall apart ? 
  lol, 
  since when accidents happen in moscow ? 
  hahahaha ... 
  i was referring to pro is living and staying in europe ... the ones we see in tv normally go away to syria or iraque to their jihad thing, 
  ... there \u00b4 re people in europe pro is ? 
  ... shit, 
  it won \u00b4 t solve the grow problem printing more money ... the problem is more complex than that ... is just deflation control and real politics for suckers !, 
  i like spanish ... special spanish girls !, 
  thanks for this article , 
  here in portugal i see firefighters setting fires , so money from government keeps pumping in to fight fires ... 
  i can only imagine one tiny faction of what arms industry has done to the world over our history . 
  what unprofessional troops ... looks like thugs that don \u00b4 t have nothing else to do but to grab some guns and shoot some people, 
  3,8 % non eu citizens in france ? 
  ... so why all that fuzz about islamic people , and the extreme right shit ? 
  ... france keeps disappointing every day :(, 
  russia needs some progress ( meaning : more public debt ) to their citizens , directly financed by western financial sector ... 
  doesn \u00b4 t make much sense ... 
  the plane was shoot down in rebel control area , which means ukraine couldn \u00b4 t control the weapons being used there ... makes a lot more sense to sue rebels ... 
  putin \u00b4 s troll brigade will face downsizes ... time to find another job for them !, 
  apparently xxi century russia is going to be a bigger disaster than xx century collapse of urss ... russia \u00b4 s race to the bottom . 
  lol, 
  it would be funny to know who \u00b4 s financing all this break away movements ... maybe our russian or chinese friends have something to say about this, 
  because separation means `` we have to pay our bills , not someone else '' ... sucks ; if you divide a region you accentuate his differences . 
  that south spain density ... it \u00b4 s summer time !, 
  russia has no credibility no demand anything, 
  16.18 $ for a ticket ? 
  ... damm , that \u00b4 s expensive, 
  in what planet does putin lives ? 
  ... not earth for sure, 
  no if i get rich in the process ... 
  i will be a respected person in society then ... 
  no , just a facts reminder, 
  just kill them and take their fortune ... they only get rich in the first place , by stealing or exploring someone else work ... 
  i guess it \u00b4 s time to give back to the people what was taken from them by force ... 
  my thought too ... it \u00b4 s clear on purpose so they can climb the trucks ... 
  beware of the little green men, 
  i agree ; but i also don \u00b4 t see a long lasting partnership between china and russia against the west ... 
  still the portuguese debt value is much higher with the $ than could ever been with the previous currency ... despite the market spotting a difference between portuguese bonds and germany ones, 
   so would that mean that the entire advantage was the result in the commitment to developing a skilled labour force ? 
  and how come they were able to develop such a labour force and no one else seems to be able to ? 
  i believe is not only to have a skilled labour force , but a technical skilled labour force ... portugal saw the rise of graduates from universities in the last decades ; but this labour force is not applied in the production of technical skilled products and services for export ; in the limit you can have a factory where the one who does the job probably can not read and write , and his chief is a graduate with 5 or more years from university ... you see the point . 
   4 ) ( big one ) the introduction of the euro in germany now means that the currency is undervalued for the purpose of german exports . 
  this allows other countries to buy german goods more cheaply than they would be able to if germany had their own domestic currency . 
  there \u00b4 s the other side of the coin ; portugal with the euro can borrow a lot more money from the markets , than what it would with the previous currency ; basically the markets are borrowing money to portugal as they would to germany , because if things go wrong , germany will be there to save the day . 
  so you get peripheral countries like portugal with massive debt burdens and a germany exporter with massive surplus . 
  in part because countries like portugal can \u00b4 t organize themselves to be productive , innovative and efficient ... and have all the resources to do that ;, 
  in case you haven \u00b4 t noticed the only place where is war , devastation and misery in eastern europe is where russia puts their hands on ... 
  good ... where do i sign in ? 
  north korea, 
  eu it \u00b4 s official in war with russia .
