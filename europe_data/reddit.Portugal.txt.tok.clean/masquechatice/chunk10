  there \u00b4 s only one thing for portugal to be perfect ... to have no portuguese \u00b4 s living here ... or in exchange for nordic blond women , 
  something tells me you are very easy to be amazed, 
   so yeah , drop the usual rhetoric of the ruling party in greece which pretends that gd and the greek people who do n't like the ruling party are equally extremist . 
  i don \u00b4 t like a lot of things , but that doesn \u00b4 t mean i go out harming people ; you \u00b4 re accusing me of manipulating words , but the only who is manipulating realities is you ... don \u00b4 t mix what is can \u00b4 t be mix ... extremism in any form is using force and violence to pass ideas or political ideology ... so make everyone a favor and don \u00b4 t blur the lines ; ** everyone who uses force is an extremist ** ** edit : ** have you ever wondered that apart of the failed greek society , the rising of leftish anarchists or extremist left groups caused the rise of gd as a political party ? 
  have you ever asked yourself that violence only leads to more violence ? 
  ... the harsh reality is that greece killed fyssas because it didn \u00b4 t stopped the rise in the first place , of extremist of leftwing extremists or anarchist groups . 
  i guess i have to remember you , that not long ago , in greece , athens , when the country declared bankruptcy a lot of left revolutionary people set the streets on fire , especially a bank , where people inside where killed ... 
  the modus operandis is different but the shit is the same ; ** ps : i \u00b4 m being downvoted by leftwing extremist or rightwing ? 
   leftist garbage correction : **  leftist garbage and rightist criminal garbage ** extremism is all the same , wether right or left . 
  i totally agree . 
  people call me crazy when i say the us will default and that is only a matter of time ... 
  the fed stimulus can \u00b4 t even be stopped because the economy is totally dependent of it . 
  ** edit ** : basically economies like the us , uk or japan than are heavily in debts economies are hanged by their reputation as a good place to invest ... 
  dollar is the most used currency , but the euro worths more than the dollar ? 
  i guess that graph doesn \u00b4 t tell the all story ... far from that !, 
  is it possible a country to buy 5 % of other country ? 
  what happened to the old fashioned conquer by military ? 
  the guy likes nomadic living !!!, 
  ... clear a misfit in the `` capitalist , money is everything , i fuck you now because it suits me '' philosophy . 
   how is the situation in other countries at the moment ? 
  portugal has no record of migrants violence in recent years or decades . 
   there are enough resources to end poverty the poverty problem is not a resources problem ; you can give a million euros to a poor man and after a time it will be poor again . 
  ( at least to a large majority of them ), 
  explain me what \u00b4 s the big fuss for being independent !, 
  isn \u00b4 t the living standard of the population what matters most ? 
  isn \u00b4 t people just going foolish after a new politician class that is only defending their interests os having a job ? 
  i just don \u00b4 t believe in a negotiated agreement when the parts are in extremed positions like a war . 
  some years ago when portugal was thinking about asking for financial help , the now pm went for a elections campaign lunch in a restaurant ; when he and other people where eating and talking some guys in a near by table finished their meal and started to leave ; one of this guys tall , strong 50 or so years old , went to the actual pm table and said something like `` when i get back to my country i hope i don \u00b4 t have to pay for this meal '' ( the meal that pedro passos coelho and friends where eating ) this his a story pedro passos coelho told in the election campaign , and somehow i didn \u00b4 t forgot ... probably because i fell bad being portuguese and in a moment of need i had to ask for help to this kind of people . 
  portugal doesn \u00b4 t default ( because we did get help from fmi , eu and bce ... greece also did get help from this 3 and default anyway ) some years ago when portugal was thinking about asking for financial help , the now pm went for a elections campaign lunch in a restaurant ; when he and other people where eating and talking some guys in a near by table finished their meal and started to leave ; one of this guys tall , strong 50 or so years old , went to the actual pm table and said something like `` when i get back to my country i hope i don \u00b4 t have to pay for this meal '' ( the meal that pedro passos coelho and friends where eating ) this his a story pedro passos coelho told in the election campaign , and somehow i didn \u00b4 t forgot ... probably because i fell bad being portuguese and in a moment of need i had to ask for help to this kind of people . 
  oops ... 
  i admit i have a special sadist side waiting to see how northern well managed countries manage a change in their economical and social status quo ;, 
  wasn \u00b4 t syria a french colony ? 
  ... so this shit is also their colonial heritage !, 
  yeah certainly ... russia and china will always vote against the use of force in the unsc , no matter what happens in syria . 
  this kind of delegates the un to a second place when any-kind of military action is needed . 
  free lunch for everyone !, 
  yeahh ... 
  i know what it feels ... one day you wake up in the morning screaming : `` fuck !!!, 
  i was born in a shit hole country that no one gives a fuck !, 
  whatever ... pays his bills, 
  germany pays is bills ... unlike greece !, 
  that lives on borrowed money, 
  british economy will go bust like any other big economy in the world ... just don \u00b4 t focus your attention on the short term ... what is happening to world economy is bigger than any small short term trend . 
  france and britain only want to divert attention from domestic matters ... nothing like a good small war to change voters focus from screwed up economies . 
  like russia could play in the same level field has the west ... west rules technological and logistical , with no adversary in sight, 
  any investment is always questionably , especially when it goes wrong ; i \u00b4 m not defending big construction firms that made special deals with portuguese government , but the fact is that we are better with a lot or good roads than few and bad . 
  it should be protected by coalition forces , meaning ... check in for people entering the protected zone , police trained by coalition forces to patrol the protected zone and coalition air space protection . 
  they should build a safe zone in syria ... a zone in the ground big enough to accommodate refugees and those who want a new peaceful start ; kind of , rebooting the country !, 
  it \u00b4 s rounded to only two digits ... the difference is below the cents . 
  it \u00b4 s the same problem all over again ; older generations are unable to handle the power to newer generations in a soft way ... 
  in the middle east this is taken to extremes where newer generations have to actually fight against the status quo represented in older people who tend to perpetuate themselves in power . 
  conclusion : no one would want to go live in britain except to buy a new pair of levis, 
   really , the privatisation of public assets and other neoliberal policies did n't bring anything good . 
  i don \u00b4 t know what neoliberal means , because i \u00b4 m not so cult as you , but i guess that a bankrupted state has to sell assets to pay his bills ... it \u00b4 s called fact of life policies . 
  when there \u00b4 s money falling from the sky , life is great ... free money for all ; when time comes to pay the bills : oh my god !, 
  their came the neoliberal again . 
  everybody knows that the prehistoric ancestor of europeans is silvio berlusconi ; this guy is like a political dinosaur, 
  that \u00b4 s because russian mafia uses more eu fiscal paradises, 
   ` go back to subsistence agriculture ' is a pretty bad economic plan this is bigger than any economic plan ... it \u00b4 s called `` put food on the table '' so people don \u00b4 t suffer from poor nutrition or die from it . 
   very quickly the new farmers would want to be a part of a money economy technically a skilled worked could get a job in his or her expertise area , when in time they came up if they ever will ; it \u00b4 s like a temporary survival mode . 
   is the subsistence agriculture our future ? 
  at least you could hope for one future , no mather what future , because in the present you have something to eat ; and more important you can be more self sufficient . 
   and , how would you get the farmland if you are poor ? 
  the governement could allocate land to new farmers , for free or for a small rent ; people could put food on the table , the land would be more clean against fires ... 
   given that greece ( or some other countries ) are n't going to recover so you think that will be some other countries immune to this ? 
  ... like northern countries ? 
  ... france is in his way down and germany grow prospects , if any , are probably below 1 %, 
  just wondering : couldn \u00b4 t this people grow their own food if they lived , not in cities , but in rural areas where they could have easy access to agriculture fields ? 
  tourism season is typical the third quarter not the second, 
  in that case forgive me for being the kind of asshole this guys are . 
  of course not ... but this is not a favor their are doing , and we \u00b4 re suppose to `` thank '' them ; we \u00b4 re bankrupted but we aren \u00b4 t the stupid people they want to make us believe we are . 
   think we 've contributed with over $ 11 bn in loans ** loans ** means your selfish country will get the money back plus interest rates , that will have to be payed by bankrupted countries like portugal ... so fuck you and your charity . 
  this is business and i hope this asshole politicians and people in general in this fucked up country that is portugal will pay every cent + interest back to the lenders . 
   if we were to have a referendum today , it would be like asking your rich friend to join a country club with a really bad reputation . 
  the euro zone doesn \u00b4 t need selfish countries like yours , we \u00b4 re fine like this ... and when in a near future countries like yours knock on euro door to beg to enter we will think about it and see if sweden is of any interest for the euro . 
   i 'm not so sure that it will ever work properly anymore euro has is problems , like his menber states and like anything run by people and for the people ... it \u00b4 s evolving , some problems are being fix , others take a lot more of time ... but one thing i \u00b4 m sure ; the euro will be the reference exchange money for international commercial transactions in a not so far future, 
  i was wondering how a fucked up mind like his , handled he fact that he had n't a lot of followers in his fucked up ideology , like he intendant, 
  that \u00b4 s not what most bothers me ; currently we have a lot of work force available , but there \u00b4 s no work for them ... essentially we are talking of very poor qualified people , for low skill jobs , that can be made in china . 
  so is not a matter of quantity of the people available is the value added they can bring to the market ; that \u00b4 s a problem to solve in generations not in years . 
  structural reforms and world economic slowdown make it almost impossible ; here in portugal we probably won \u00b4 t get a decent grow for the next 30 years or so . 
  that \u00b4 s being worked out . 
  i recently saw news from military exercices by several eu countries in central portugal , ( [ here ] ( http://www.eda.europa.eu/hb13 ) ) and the eu president dur\u00e3o barroso has talked about the need of more military muscle by the eu recently, 
  i don \u00b4 t want to rely on us for military interventions . 
   because it 's unfair for america , france and united kingdom to shoulder the european union 's entire military burden where did you get this idea ? 
  even portugal has troops abroad in countries like afghanistan or kosovo . 
  who pays this troops ? 
  portugal does . 
  ok the level of portuguese intervention is small , but so is the country . 
  there \u00b4 s one thing called nato ; even if that \u00b4 s not enough , the eu can decide to intervene in a political decision , and every single country can deploy troops ... you are missing the point here ... and your vision on this is totally biased . 
  there \u00b4 re reforms in the eu that could take place to decide military interventions without the need of a common military body . 
  why should there be a common military with distributed expenses ? 
  so that lobby military companies know what door to knock ? 
  ... a lot of the us military interventions where , especially in recent times , to give something to destroy to a multimillionaire war machine ... a lot of people in the us depend and live in the military industry ... they never will face the reality that one day they have to come home and do something else , it \u00b4 s a major political/economical lobby . 
  people constantly miss the point that is not an europe crisis ; the all world is coming to an economic alt and an world mega recession is settling in ... 
  i prefer to live in europe on in the us when all hell breaks loose than living in any other recent pseudo developed country . 
   that 's why it 's human , we make mistakes , i totally agree ; but there \u00b4 re mistakes and mistakes ; if you have an employee who showed off the velocity abilities in the past taking photos of it , who probably showed to be unstable in a life responsibility work ... someone should clear solve this problem waiting to happen to this poor guy a long time ago ; i \u00b4 m referring to his boss , who had a employee not suited to the job he was handling . 
  i hope the driver won \u00b4 t get all the blames ; independent of his level of fault , there \u00b4 s one company and one manager who hired him . 
   totally absurd ... is the behavior of this israelis towards palestinians ; west support to this israelite extremist has to end . 
   to make myself clear . 
  i think a lot of the problems in southern europe ( the giips countries ) comes from a really bad constructed euro .
