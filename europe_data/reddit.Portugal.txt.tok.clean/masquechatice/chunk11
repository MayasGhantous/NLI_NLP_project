  austerity , in itself , ca n't fix that . 
  so , asking people to hang on to austerity , while not doing a lot of the other things one should be doing , is giving false hope in my opinion . 
  euro is in construction so is not finished ; it \u00b4 s normal to have problems ... it \u00b4 s the job of politics to solve them . 
  austerity should be used to reform the institutions , so you get a more sustainable economy ; a big problem is in the second part , in the state reforms ... the lobbies won \u00b4 t let go public workers , even if the states are bankrupt and don \u00b4 t have the money to pay the wages . 
   i belong to the minority here at / r/europe who think portugal should leave the euro ( and greece to btw ) , a majority at r/economics . 
  sorry i don \u00b4 t believe in leaving the euro ; first if that where an option greece already left a long time ago ; second leaving the euro would make imported goods so expensive that probably you would have to work all your life to get the money to buy a second hand car , and probably could not afford the fuel to drive it ... just not an reasonable option . 
  the point is the competitiveness war would have to be fight anyway , with or without the euro , the only point is that without would have been a lot less painful . 
  ** edit : ** also note that a lot of this pain cames from a world economy entering recession making harder any country economie to recover via exports . 
  also about painful don \u00b4 t go for the media ; here in portugal although the high unemployment , people can live reasonable ... there are reports of people with hungry , but i \u00b4 ve never seen it and there are a lot of help from government and non government institutions ; getting work is almost impossible , but if you are a working man you always can get something to do , at least there \u00b4 s a lot of abandoned fields to get some food if you are willing to work there . 
  there \u00b4 s also emigration ... we portuguese are an emigrant people ; so we don \u00b4 t get a higher unemployment rate , money from outside comes in and a lot of portuguese companies are exporting portuguese products to this communities all over the world . 
  i hate the people who do this, 
  i think that in insolvent european countries like greece politics is playing a major part in disinformation the population . 
  i get constantly left wing people saying things like `` printing money doesn \u00b4 t necessary leads to inflation '' ... or `` austerity is a bad thing , we should go to economic grow measures . . '' . 
  you seem to know what you \u00b4 re talking about . 
  aren \u00b4 t we assisting here , especially in insolvent countries , to a poor technical people , incompetent sometimes , playing some kind of political game to give some kind of hope to people because of austerity measures . 
  from 2 pick one ; or this people don \u00b4 t know what their are talking about , and they are just incompetent ; or they know the stuff and are playing some kind of political game . 
  i \u00b4 m not economist , but i get information from people who proved to know their stuff in recent times , and points like `` printing more money doesn \u00b4 t lead to inflation '' , just don \u00b4 t make sense to me . 
   this shows a misunderstanding of how monetary policy works do you know the alternative to austerity ? 
  ... printing money . 
  do you know the consequences of printing money ? 
  ... inflation . 
  the political decision is between economic adjustments ... meaning getting what you produce at the end of a working day , or ; injecting money into the economy with the inevitable inflation rise . 
  there \u00b4 s no easy way out , but there \u00b4 s only one way out ... making adjustments in the economy ( what normally left wing losers call austerity ) , because otherwise you will be `` solving '' a debt problem with more debt . 
  makes sense to you ? 
   austerity failed ... what the fuck ?? 
  ... greece is insolvent ; austerity is not an ideology or political mambo jambo . 
  greece is broke . 
  can \u00b4 t buy stuff . 
  where do this people live ? 
  mars ? 
   first , banking union needs to go ahead ... for what ? 
  to give a blank check to corrupt southern countries ? 
  ... jesus even my dog can make up clever arguments to continue receive is meals . 
   what was the lesson that we economists ought to have learnt from the experience of the 1920s and 30s ? 
  this crisis has nothing to do with the 29 \u00b4 s crisis . 
  ** my conclusion : ** greeks like southern countries fail to have clever people leading theirs institutions . 
  a lot of this economic philosophy is crap ... and people totally fail to recognize it, 
  why the bad guy is germany when the greek people like the government is corrupt , lied , cooked the country books so it could lie about his financial health , etc. 
  the bad guy in this story is germany with hers austerity politics , but the fact is that greek economy is a wreck , greeks are losing economic power every day , losing jobs , dependent of the good will of lenders , unable to pass reforms ; while the bad guy ( germany ) has been in the same period the strongest economy in europe ; what the fuck is wrong with this people ? 
   a uniting monarchy are forever . 
  nothing is forever . 
   i dislike the praising of a political person , like the potus, 
  i \u00b4 m unable to understand monarchy . 
  for me is totally absurd to praise someone like a royalty when is just a person like everyone else . 
  but i can respect those countries and the people who like this kind of behaviors . 
  ** edit : ** there \u00b4 re people who get fooled again and again by politics every-time we go on elections , so i guess that \u00b4 s normal to worship faked gods like the royalty ... people aren \u00b4 t very clever or rational, 
  that \u00b4 s not the crashed middle class ... it \u00b4 s the ignorant people disguised of middle class working people . 
  france and germany only accont for 37 % of all european population ; meaning the rest united is more strong than france and germany combined [ eurostat population ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do ), 
  portugueses aren \u00b4 t the only ones to blame on his fucked up economy . 
  is not a matter of southern lazy and corrupt european countries vs well managed nordic european countries . 
  is much more than that , is the aftershock of the 2008 financial crisis ... is a world mega recession comming , and in time even nordic asshole countries will be insolvent . 
  that doesn \u00b4 t eliminate the fact that being born muslim in a muslim country means , with a good chance of probability , born with a gun in your hand to shoot your neighbor ... with nothing to give to the mankind science or intellectual advance of the world . 
  in portugal we don \u00b4 t have problems with muslims , probably because they are not very much living here ; ** fact of life ** all countries with islam have war problems between them with civil wars killing a lot of people ... not a good thing being muslim . 
  i \u00b4 m all for the united states of europe ** edit : ** europe can only make a stand in a new economically mundial order united ; i hate to be on the loosers side , and a non united europe means loosing economic power, 
  because i don \u00b4 t like brainless violent people , but i \u00b4 m ok with brainless non violent people . 
  if they are violent groups , yes ... otherwise no . 
   ps+cds cds will be serious hit by this decision of his leader ; it will be very difficult to avoid the tag : `` cds is to blame for the political crisis '' ; meaning cds will probably be vaporized in the next elections . 
   public workers were reduced by 50k in the past 2 years , without any firings ... you didn \u00b4 t fired them because they went to reform ; you don \u00b4 t pay their working salary but you have to pay for the reform . 
  i don \u00b4 t even go to waste my time answering ( in my point of view ) to the other things you say ... 
  i fell hostage in my own country ; when someone tries to cut jobs or privileges from strong political or economical sectors ... all the hell breaks loose ; you don \u00b4 t need to be a genius to see what \u00b4 s wrong in this economy ... but when you hear the people that should leave their well payed and totally subsidize jobs , is like they leave in some other planet , unable to even grasp tiny parts of reality, 
  this is the end beautiful friend this is the end my only friend , the end of our elaborate plans , the end of everything that stands , the end, 
  it \u00b4 s the foreign ministry , now leaving , that should present the state reform in the coming weeks ... no one wants to get their hands dirty , and fire the public employees . 
  greece is the final example of the status quo defending himself from change ... they \u00b4 re willing to sacrifice the all country in order to save their little interest . 
  portugal is fucked up anyway !, 
   holy shit how can shit be holy ? 
   would you want to trade with a european company that is likely being spied on by the us if you have to share even the slightest sensitive information that \u00b4 s totally unrealistic , rhetoric . 
  i trade with a eu company that \u00b4 s ** good for my business ** period ; disclosing sensitive information in the business is a problem than can be tackled like any other problem , meaning there is measures i can implement to restrict business sensitive information access . 
  everybody knew there is snooping by intelligence agencies from all over the world . 
  what this release of information bring new is the extend and methodology used . 
   severely restricting access of us personnel to eu buildings i agree . 
  also raise the level of counter intelligence on us and uk , meaning debugging actions on people and eu buildings and equipments . 
  eu should be very careful reacting on this ; eu can not , i repeat can not , put at stake economic agreements between eu and us for a `` ego hurt '' vendetta ; eu citizens demand more than an emotional reaction from eu officials . 
  to me us is engaging in this behavior more to gain negotiations inside tips advantages , than anything else . 
  i think that the way animals die has importance on the quality of the meat ; i.e. 
  an animal with a fast death means that is meat is free of hormones released by the suffering in the process of death ; i \u00b4 m not an expert altought, 
  skates should be the option ... or take your own car . 
  inflation will hit hard the bottom too ... you have to keep pace with soaring prices ; it \u00b4 s always the less protected who get hit the most . 
   that 's part of the problem : too little inflation . 
  in your opinion . 
  and why \u00b4 s that ? 
   then nationalize the banks . 
  if we have to pay for the losses , then we should get the profits . 
  my personal opinion , let them go bust ... no bailouts only bailins , preserving the assurance of 100 000,00 $, 
   i know what qe means , the phrase you used it in was what did n't make any sense . 
  i said that qe is the only option central banks have to boost the economy ... that makes it less than an option and more a last resource . 
   they own the currency they are indebting themselves in the us like anyother country needs foreign investors ; with the huge debt they have , it \u00b4 s only a matter of time when investors will stop lending money to the country or will lend based on forbidden interest rates . 
   i do n't even know what this means qe is quantitive easing, 
   for one to have a + in their account another one has a - . 
  if the one with the - defaults , soon enough your bank wo n't be able to make good on the + on your account . 
  the norm until today is : a bank goes bankrupt the taxpayers will pay for that  so , maybe you 're protecting both creditors and debtors with a little inflation . 
  we have little inflation  personally , i think europe should engage in massive quantitative easing and create a banking union . 
  do pretty much what the us has done . 
  we talked about this ; us will default ... in time we will see ; qe is not an option because is the only option any central bank has to reanimate the economy  lets keep it going , it 's always fun to try and guess what country is in the next carriage . 
  italy ? 
  france ? 
  probably france ... and when the all world will be in recession germany will fall too . 
  what it is so inherent wrong with pushing reforms trough austerity ? 
  why shoudn \u00b4 t we protect from inflation the people who gathered and saved is working money ? 
  what \u00b4 s the alternative to austerity ? ... 
  giving out free money so people can embrace spending and fuel bad habits ?
