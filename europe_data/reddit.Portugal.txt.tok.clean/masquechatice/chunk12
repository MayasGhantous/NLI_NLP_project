  ** edit : ** i have one answer to all this questions : it \u00b4 s called ** change ** . 
  people pee in his pants when they sense this word, 
  are you naive enough to think there \u00b4 s only one mep doing this ? 
  one mep ? 
  ... what stops all of them doing exactly the same thing ? 
  this practice is more boardly used ... for years i known people here in portugal , ( ok , probably not a good example ) engaging in this kind of behavior ; arriving at work , checking in and leaving right away , working for themselves in near offices ; double win because they receive the paycheck from the public position and working the same time outside . 
  the cases i know are on local administration , but something tells me this is more common practice every where in the public sector . 
   why not ? 
  simple ... leaving the euro and declaring bankruptcy could miraculous save your day but the consequence to the greek economy would like catastrophic because ; greece imports a lot of goods ... can you imagine working in greece and receiving your paycheck in drakmas and going to buy an imported car and have to pay in euros ? 
  ... you probably had to work all your life just to buy a car !, 
  ... just like gasoline , food not produced in greece , auto parts , etc. 
  ... it would be like going back to the caves . 
  leaving the euro was not an option to anyone , because if it was it had been used at lot of time ago . 
  i don \u00b4 t agree ; imf lend the money for bankrupt countries to pay their bills , because there where no where else to go for this countries . 
  if greeks political system where functioning , this lending could be a good time to pass reforms to an over expenditure state ... but no ; greeks where unable to change , they hold the bad habits and waited for the money fall off the sky . 
  the sad reality is that they lost - eu lost because they shouldn \u00b4 t let greece enter the eurozone ; a reckless state should have a lot more restrict rules ... the eurozone is paying for this too . 
  sad, 
   now that the imf has destroyed the greek economy and the corruption in greece made what ? 
  pull the country to sustained development ? 
  there \u00b4 s only one to blame about the destroyed greek society ... greeks themselves . 
  basically france is run by the government and on the streets ... and the middle voter is like a pin pong ball, 
  probably don \u00b4 t , i \u00b4 m not an expert ... the fact is that the majority elected someone that is oppressing the other half of the population, 
  it \u00b4 s called the tyranny of the majority . 
  for what i see since the beginning of the protests erdogan has proved is incompetence ... don \u00b4 t know what he did in turkey was good or bad , for people to vote on him , but the last weeks has proven totally incompetent person . 
   not always independent we had neighbors with boundaries issues !, 
  ... they had no real power over here . 
  it was called `` condado portucalense '' and was formed in 1139 ... 
  i believe that if not the first probably the second nation state in europe . 
  ( but correct me if i \u00b4 m wrong , 
  the first nation state in europe has pre historic settlements , rich and diverse culture , was one of the colonial powers in europe . 
  brazil , angola , mozambique , goa , macao ... where all portuguese colonies , making the portuguese culture very rich and left also some of the portuguese culture in this places . 
  great weather , warm , sunny , excellent beaches and nice country sides . 
  the cuisine is mediterranean and very tasty ; great olive oil , great wine and an excellent atlantic fish . 
  man i spend so many times complaining about portuguese problems i forget how great my country is !, 
  damn, 
  thanks, 
  vatican in the arms deal ? 
  wtf, 
  who gives a shit what the french think ... ? 
  ... they \u00b4 re the next to go bankrupt in europe !, 
  and they actually pay to people to scan my life and my computer ? 
  ... damn , they could pay me instead and i would give that info !, 
  maybe if europe fostered entrepreneurship like the us same of this companies could had born in the ue ... and then again maybe the ue could have had more control on this matters, 
  don \u00b4 t know !, 
  what i know is mainstream media tagging crisis in every sentence they broadcast , and there \u00b4 s a war going on ... not so silence some times , between those who worked and saved for the future , and don \u00b4 t want high inflation to loose money , and those with hight debt that want high inflation rates so their debts will diminish over time, 
   us inflation between 2-3 % is one of the best things about the american economy . 
  there \u00b4 re rumors that the us is manipulating inflation metrics to distorce inflacion numbers ... there \u00b4 re people who examined prices in 10 years periods since 1970 and between 2002 and 2012 spoted a price increase of 52.1 % compared to 27,5 % by the government, 
  life too ... if you have the power to embrace change, 
   i think this will create quite a terrible future probaly you \u00b4 re right ... but will be a more sustainable future in adjusting the state costs to the economic ability to sustain those costs . 
  is helping making the reforms in the economy that otherwise where postponed ... ok !, 
  this means a lot of pain for a lot of people for a long time ... that \u00b4 s a fact ; but do you think that economic grow will be like a endless rise to prosperity and progress ? 
  ... come on ... especially with the open market in china , the economic game has changed dramaticly, 
  printing money in those countries is making real miracles ... sure !, 
  is the most fragile in society that pay for economic/political misguidence, 
  printing vast sums os money won \u00b4 t solve anything ... you have to address economic structural problems, 
   the text that was put through under this name was never voted by the peoples why should ? 
  when i vote in national elections in a pr\u00f3 european party i \u00b4 m delegating in that party the power to decide this questions , and others . 
  why should we have a referendum every month ? 
  the level of faith that french putted on fran\u00e7ois hollande makes me wonder the intelligence level of the french ... 
  they don \u00b4 t understand nothing what \u00b4 s going on in europe and in the world . 
  ** edit : ** the state pay check for an ( old age ) elite made them totally absent from reality, 
  france is proteccionist . 
  i think europe lived better without france . 
  why do i sense this is a personnal war between britain and france ? 
  it \u00b4 s in the german \u00b4 s best interest to keep the euro . 
   he alternative would have been much worse : a bail-in of the people . 
  meaning that a large portion of greek savings would have disappeared over night , creating a depression much worse than the current one . 
  they have to go anyway . 
  not only in greece but in the all civilized world . 
  we all have to much not payable debt ; debt must be destroyed ... but to destroy debt you must destroy money , meaning people will have to loose a lot of savings , purchasing power ... in fact that \u00b4 s what been happening not only in greece but in the rest of europe . 
  left wing incompetents don \u00b4 t understand this and insist in wiping out countries debt , exposing the countries to a money wipe out from one day to the other ; then again maybe their are not incompetents , maybe they want this for a revolution . 
  a clear try to make people fear of refugees ... and it doesn \u00b4 t make sense at all, 
  wild idea ; aren \u00b4 t coalition flights going on in syria right now ? 
  ( to attack is targets ) won \u00b4 t coalition flight encounter russian flights with transponders off ? 
  ( engage possible hostile ), 
  what a mess ... nice post , thanks, 
  how can people in germany say this things ... especially in germany , after 2 ww . 
  if this was in hungary or greece ... but germany ? 
  people don \u00b4 t learn do they ? 
  the truth is that she attacked refugees trying to escape police line ... this was not the only attack , before , she attacked more people trying to escape the police line . 
  besides the intention it \u00b4 s there ... and the person falls . 
  like that would change anything, 
  genius, 
  let \u00b4 s face it ; eastern european people have a bad reputation for a long time, 
  i believe in you guys . 
  this crisis just put in question , once more , the incompetence of the governments to solve real problems . 
  pcp it \u00b4 s the `` nomal '' communist party , this guy it \u00b4 s more extreme than pcp . 
  it \u00b4 s the same guy for the last 40 years heading pcp mrpp , with the same radical discourse against capitalism ;, 
   even if we create a innovative new `` facebook or google '' the big players will buy them or make their own version and push the newcomer out of the market . 
  where was europe in the 90 \u00b4 s when internet started as we know it today , and when google was a very normal search engine and facebook didn \u00b4 t exist ? 
  it \u00b4 s not a person ; it \u00b4 s the bet that new technologies have the power to shape societies , made by us elites a long time ago , probably in the 80 \u00b4 s or even before , that resulted in us being the avant garde of internet firms , with google , facebook ... etc. 
  this things aren \u00b4 t a decision of a person and don \u00b4 t spring out of nothing from one day to the other . 
  by lack of strategic vision of europeans . 
  that \u00b4 s it , skype ? 
  ... that \u00b4 s the response that europe has to give on us mega internet companies ? 
  ... and it has already been bought by microsoft, 
  who is the typical voter in gd ? 
  the guy only needs to make 1 kind pillow ... 
  this people just keep walking and walking ... do they have any idea where they are going ? 
  one day the land will end and they are faced with only sea ahead ... just saying,
