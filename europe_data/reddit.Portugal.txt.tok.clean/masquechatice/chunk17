  greeks have done every thing wrong man ... over and over again . 
  now they are on their one, 
   sovereign debt is not household debt . 
  it 's not supposed to be paid back . 
  where would banks/savers , pension funds or insurance companies park their money if not in safe sovereign bonds ? 
  what ? 
  the all system it \u00b4 s based on trust , so you \u00b4 re saying that if i invest in state debt there \u00b4 s a good chance i wouldn \u00b4 t be payed back ? 
  ... nice trust you put there . 
  what you probably want to say , and what it \u00b4 s correct for me , every country needs debt to grow , in that sense it will never be totally paid back . 
  the problem here it \u00b4 s the amount of debt ... ** 175 % of gdp it \u00b4 s insolvency ** ... ** 60-80 % it \u00b4 s probably ok ** ... there \u00b4 s a big difference in this numbers and in the way you put your discourse, 
  carl bildt : `` greek finmin varoufakis jumps ship . 
  after having brought it to state of a wreck . '', 
   spain as a nation was technically never bailed out . 
  because it \u00b4 s to big to fail , so they had to call it something else , and saved the insolvent banking sector ... it \u00b4 s different from saving the all country , but an insolvent banking system is as problematic as an insolvent public sector . 
  i don \u00b4 t agree with you . 
  greek debt it \u00b4 s small compared to the ez gdp , but portuguese debt it \u00b4 s also not payable , spain , and italy are on the same path ... this debt relieves combined are the apocalypse of the financial system . 
  i say it again , if you forgive greeks debt you have to forgive all the other debts . 
  eu project it \u00b4 s to avoid war in europe ; putting this project at risk it \u00b4 s assuming you are prepared to grab a weapon and fight for your life and a piece of land ... 
  if this it \u00b4 s what this extremist movements want , when in case of greece , not only did not accomplish nothing to improve greek situation in this 5 months , they also eroded the trust of the ez partners ... if this people want war , then i need to prepare for it . 
   we might as well reduce the eu to the benelux and the nordic council . 
  we \u00b4 re all in this together . 
  not only ez or eu , the all developed world man . 
  the weakest countries like greece are the first ones to go , but after that everyone goes , even the nordic ones . 
  germany will probably be the last one to fall because it \u00b4 s the strongest one, 
  yah right , like that would be reasonable ; so you forget the greek debt and all the other countries with the same problem will have to carry the debt burden ... this is not going to happen . 
  forgive greek debt , forgive all the debts = financial meltdown, 
  printing money to give to greece it \u00b4 s no solution , because without reforms there \u00b4 s no money that can make the economy grow . 
  all the money you poor in it \u00b4 s to maintain old addictions, 
   we all know that the problem with the greek debt is political and not financial . 
  what ? 
  can \u00b4 t be more financial than this ; greek debt is not payable , and forgiving it also means forgiving other debts country ... then we are talking of the all system meltdown, 
  greece has to print his own coin ... the party with someone else \u00b4 s money it \u00b4 s over ... greece it \u00b4 s still more fucked up than ever was, 
  now it \u00b4 s time of the 18 left member states of the euro to give the middle finger to greece from the democrat elected representatives, 
  we \u00b4 re all hostages of greeks now, 
  well i didn \u00b4 t miss you, 
  of course not ... `` no '' is about to win ; people have speak and now money will appear to pay pensions and all the life style greeks need, 
  so greece doesn \u00b4 t want to do the reforms it needs to be self sustainable , and we all have to pay for this ? 
  ... nuke the place, 
  people follow him and vote for him , so i guess he is the least crazy of all, 
  so , what \u00b4 s the difference here with portugal ? 
  ... 133 % of debt means that we lost at least 1 or 2 generations, 
  greece : let it burn , there \u00b4 s nothing we can do . 
  what happens if they never reach an agreement ? 
  ... and bce limits ela, 
  i see, 
  ahh ok , central banks print money , how can they possible go insolvent, 
  wtf ? 
  ecb solvency ? 
  people like him don \u00b4 t have a conscience to be clean ... 
  we \u00b4 re next in line in case of debt relief , then ireland , spain , italy ... and suddenly we are all in a big big mess, 
  probably not ; but they can also argument that the incompetent greek government did \u00b4 t follow the plan , because the troika can point the way , but it \u00b4 s the greek government that carries him out, 
   nothing came off it ? 
  yet, 
   they would n't have said they could save greece . 
  how can they say that if greece can \u00b4 t help her self ? 
  the troika can provide some money so that the greece government can perform their reforms , gaining time for the adjustment ... it \u00b4 s not troika that \u00b4 s running greece, 
  no shit ... nothing new here . 
  so she admits greece is not a viable state, 
  chomsky is a good man , but this edological left wing thinking about economic policies it \u00b4 s no ground in reality . 
  although austerity in recession is bad for business , and it \u00b4 s a good logical clich\u00e9 for left wing propaganda , the fact is that injecting liquidity in an economy that it \u00b4 s not competitive and does \u00b4 t add value , it \u00b4 s just throwing money to a hole ; this countries are paying their incapacity to reform their society , to make it less corrupt and more competitive . 
  if those guys knew what they where doing , they would \u00b4 t had promised what they could \u00b4 t accomplish, 
  neither with a `` no '' vote, 
  europe would be a better place if actual europeans where half of the person this people are ; this people love an europe most europeans despise, 
  i won \u00b4 t change my shit hole for yours ... at least we still have some dignity ... just watch what greece has come to ... 
  i know ... it \u00b4 s the arrogance of the people who have done shit over and over again that bothers me, 
  greeks think they are the most working in europe . 
  the fact that their country is a shit hole , is the result exterior forces , the iluminati , capitalism ... trying to destroy greek superior way of life, 
  the only thing that is not sustainable is the lack of reforms in the greek society and the lack of competitiveness of their private sector, 
   if you paid everyone huge salaries to dig holes and then fill them in again , gdp would soar . 
  if you paid everyone huge salaries inflation would soar . 
  seems to me syriza is doing a good job ... 
  for me nothing is wrong ... is not my pensions or my money that is lock in some insolvent bank ... so go ahead with your referendum that in practise won \u00b4 t solve nothing, 
   mr. tsipras believes -- and plenty of american and british economists are sympathetic to this view -- that this trade-off was driven by bad economics and had disastrous human consequences . 
  austerity without debt write-downs created a depression , making the debt burden even harder to handle . 
  that perspective to me doesn \u00b4 t make sense because without reforms , no matter how much stimulus you pour into a sick economy , grow won \u00b4 t happen, 
  that \u00b4 s suicide, 
  economists ... if this guys knew anything about economy we wouldn \u00b4 t be in this situation without knowing how to get out of it, 
  there are good propaganda and bad propaganda ... but always propaganda , from both sides ; despite the propaganda if you think capital controls is a good thing , go ahead with your vote ... let \u00b4 s all see how deep goes the rabbit hole . 
  but this means people will suffer more, 
  it \u00b4 s like watching a car heading towards a wall ... what can you do to wake up the driver ? 
  this greek government is dead ... it will lose no matter the outcome, 
  you don \u00b4 t know what you say ... give it enough time and 13 % unemployment will be the rule for all developed countries, 
  laugh all you want ... 
  the last one to laugh is the one who laughs better, 
  euro won \u00b4 t fail ... euro will surpass the dollar as the world trade currency, 
  i think it is, 
  russia want \u00b4 s to divide europe ... nothing new, 
   stick-wielding anarchist youths attacked the hq of the antarsya -- a far-left anti-capitalist party -- because the latter had tried to make them pay to go into a music festival when the anarchists thought it should be free . 
  wtf ? 
  lol, 
  so every country debt should be forgiven, 
  everybody wants to stay in the euro ... even eastern countries want to join the euro , and the ones who did are very pleased ... only this guys want to leave, 
  the 25 % gdp drop is not a measure is a result of ... and printing money to a bad economy won \u00b4 t solve nothing, 
  what \u00b4 s wrong with being economical efficient and optimize your resources ... austerity is for starters living within your means . 
  this is like buying the country, 
  the euro is in trouble ? 
   by contrast , a no vote would at least open the possibility that greece , with its strong democratic tradition , might grasp its destiny in its own hands 50 mp \u00b4 s are automatic awarded to the winning party in greek elections ... mp \u00b4 s that don \u00b4 t represent votes ... that \u00b4 s democracy ? 
  yeah , but the problem with economics is that the politicians tend to follow the advices from this `` illuminated '' people ... 
  literature ? 
  so this is what the end of politicians and politics looks like ...
