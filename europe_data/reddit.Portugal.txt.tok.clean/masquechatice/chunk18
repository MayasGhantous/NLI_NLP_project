  worth it ? 
  ... don \u00b4 t know ; inevitable ? 
  ... yes, 
  ok ... that makes all the difference, 
  great euro crisis ? 
  ... euro meltdown ? 
  ... wtf ? 
  ... is this a joke ? 
  there should \u00b4 t exist a nobel prize in economics ... it isn \u00b4 t a exact science and errors following someone or a line of thinking can cause a lot of harm to people, 
  isis is in war with everyone ... even with itself, 
  don \u00b4 t mess with people \u00b4 s head !, 
  no one wins ... we all lose, 
  innocent people die, 
  the stupidity of all this is just horrendous ; this new greek government had no bargain power , had nothing 0 ; and still they tried to play the big game ; what of disgrace . 
  people want their way of life ... pensions , cars , holidays , job in the office , free welfare ... all the things that money can provide , and still they want to impose their conditions to the guys to lend them money ... what a stupidity, 
  greeks are very confident on this syriza government, 
  yes/no to austerity !, 
  ... that \u00b4 s a tough choice !, 
   but something tells me that might change when tsipras tells them the cost of staying in ok, 
   in a recent opinion poll , 7 out of 10 greeks want to keep the euro at all costs . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/06/19/greeks-in-last-ditch-rally-to-stay-in-the-eurozone/ ), 
  don \u00b4 t the polls say greeks want to stay in the euro ? 
  doesn \u00b4 t the polls say that more than 60 % of the greeks want to stay in the euro ? 
  ... referendum for what ? 
  to know the answer we already know ? 
  well it is ... what can you do against terrorism ? 
  good ... then the creditors will have something to sell at the auctions insolvent, 
  lol, 
  russia invades the next day, 
  it would \u00b4 t be my neighbour a long time ago . 
  why \u00b4 s that ? 
  i would build a bunker with dried food for a year, 
  we don \u00b4 t need anarchy . 
  no one does . 
  power to the people, 
   you 're assuming the imf truly really wants what is best for greece and is infallible no i \u00b4 m not . 
  imf doesn \u00b4 t give a shit for greece . 
  imf just wants to protect the money it invested in greece , by being paid back by the greek government ; that \u00b4 s their only interest ; the greek people should be a concern of the greek government ; don \u00b4 t mix the things because i assume that either you don \u00b4 t know what you say , or are intentional doing left wing stupid propaganda . 
  i think the government should take the measures to protect his citizens . 
  to change the laws to promote the private sector grow , fire public workers or privatize public assets ... you need imf approval ? 
  that \u00b4 s hitting the bottom ; besides if wise measures where taken to the imf by the greek government , i doubt they would oppose ... but if that \u00b4 s the case !!!, 
  ... prepare for civil war and country disintegration . 
  without a deal in the eurozone , greece it \u00b4 s history . 
  if now you \u00b4 re against a 5 % pensions cut , after a failed deal you will not have money for pensions ( worst scenario ) ... good luck to all greeks . 
  i think this is the end of greece as we know it . 
   it can not make decisions for itself man those propaganda sound bites ... who makes every day decisions on greece ? 
  who decides to hire of fire public workers ? 
  who decides to raise or lower taxes ? 
  like you said printing your own money makes politician \u00b4 s life more easy , but the ordinary man having to deal with hiper inflation is kind of disturbing ; imagine going for a drink in a coffee esplanade and having to pay the drink when the waiters delivers her ... because if you wait until you leave the esplanade , it will cost you more . 
  imagine with the hyper inflation trying to save some money to the future ? 
  ... the money you saved for a long time will be worthless and on ... 
  i think this is no solution . 
  if you trying to save yourself on the exports rise , with the money devaluation , no one guarantees you that you will have enough exports to run the country ... it \u00b4 s a bad management decision anyway i look at it . 
  i \u00b4 m not question all those results , from the failed imf policy 's ; what i question is the ability of a country to save himself , recovering from years and years of bad social and political bad decisions , hoping that an external entity solve the problems they been gathering all this time . 
  the imf can make bad decisions , basically it doesn \u00b4 t give a shit about the results of that ( ok , maybe some public acknowledge of bad policies ) but the ones who get fucked are the countries ; in that sense have you ever asked yourself , that maybe , just maybe , the imf and germany and ... is just the smallest of your problems ? 
  maybe you sick society is the first one to blame for this ? 
  yahh ok , i \u00b4 ve heard that propaganda manifesto before, 
  it \u00b4 s in the same [ page ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2015/jun/26/greece-crisis-markets-to-open-lower-ahead-of-weekend-talks-live#block-558d0526e4b0ec49dbd1f4b0 ) of the link you posted, 
   greek labour minister says creditors asking for ` suicide of an entire people ' change is a difficult thing for everyone , but this greeks blow up any scale of difficulty in accepting change ;, 
  we don \u00b4 t need leaders ... we need lucid people to make the best options in their life 's . 
  leaders are for the 20st century, 
  lol, 
  na ... extremist is more of a terrorist , that wants to revolutionize for his own agenda, 
  that \u00b4 s the past ... better wake up ; so , freedom , solidarity , diversity , development , culture ... 
  nothing new about putin \u00b4 s support on extremist, 
  one problem of making public your positions during negotiations is that compromise your position making almost impossible to make concession to reach an agreement, 
  are you sure you \u00b4 re not retard ? 
  this [ one ] ( http://www.portalimo.pt/pt-pt/localidade/variacaopreco/1/1/0/1/lisboa/lisboa ) also looks good, 
  this is an interesting topic ; i will search for more info on this and investigate something . 
  if you know where i can find studies on the costs of construction , please share . 
  construction prices are very , very , very inflated . 
  construction costs are very low when we talk about materials , what makes costs rise it \u00b4 s labour . 
  but basically prices from the house market stayed the same from pre 2008 bubble , with a lot less work contractors , that where used to earn a lot of money , run into troubles mostly by bad management . 
  we still live a better life than nordic countries though ... 
  the weather , the food and the people are way better . 
  so that \u00b4 s why no one wants to come live to europe , or be part of the eu ... wait, 
  i \u00b4 m very disturbed by your insult ... wait ... no i \u00b4 m not . 
  your arguments are irrefutable ... i \u00b4 m totally convinced now ... keep the pensions , you guys total deserve them, 
  it \u00b4 s official : syriza wants to destroy what \u00b4 s left of greece in order to keep the privileges for some and to do paymaster \u00b4 s putin job, 
  on the flip side , we enjoy life because living with everything under control is more for robots than for humans . 
  nordics know this and the `` chaos underdeveloped southern countries '' speech , just denotes some envy at the bottom of their mostly cold heart ...  just kidding here \u00b4 s some [ proof ] ( https://vimeo.com/126516612 ), 
  `` greece disrespectful treatment of other european countries '', 
  cuban missiles crisis all over again, 
   either merkel becomes the midwife of a new europe or she will find herself relegated by history as responsible for having killed forever a european dream . 
  this dream is bigger than any person agenda ; there can be bumps in the way but the train is already in motion also syriza lack of trust is also a result of out of reality extreme left ideas ... this is why i never saw syriza as a revolutionary movement capable of anything concrete other than isolate himself, 
  ops sorry , wrong topic, 
   you could just be gone so do you, 
  damm ... no pussies and bad tits ... disappointing, 
   s if to do nothing more than call attention to yourself anything anyone say here calls attention to them . 
  you can just hide my comments and i will be gone ; i don \u00b4 t want to be relevant ... and the venom goes both ways ... 
  i can actually think some postings are insulting by other people, 
  so my unsupported opinions makes you think i want to be relevant ? 
  ... makes sense . 
  people are just that ... people . 
  do you worship people ? 
  ... grow up . 
  krugman is a left wing dick head that earns money because people like you pay to listen to him, 
  stupid questions : how do you know that ? 
  how do you know i want to be relevant ? 
  don \u00b4 t you have no else to harass ... yes i \u00b4 m serious ; this dick head of the paul krugman misses his predictions over and over ... probably paid by some obscure entity to say bullshit,
