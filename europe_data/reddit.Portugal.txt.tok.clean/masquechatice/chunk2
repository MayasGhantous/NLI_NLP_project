  ** edit : ** fuck russia, 
  nothing . 
  thanks, 
   some positive news came from germany , where industrial output recorded its strongest performance in more than two years . 
  where is germany selling their products to ? 
  the west and the us has the upper hand on this ... even in a cold war like situation , economic sanctions against russia could collapse her economy and her government after , in the long run ... so i think putin hasn \u00b4 t got a lot of options here . 
  i don \u00b4 t think you understand the logic . 
  i don \u00b4 t agree with you ; except the part where people can reproduce without sex . 
  the same way he says god doesn \u00b4 t exists , i can say god exists ... and there \u00b4 s no way to prove who is right , it all boils down to have or not to have faith ; i have because i know there are a lot of things i don \u00b4 t understand and a lot of things i can \u00b4 t control in my life ... god and christ fill a room in my life that was empty , giving hope and life where there was none . 
  no one wants to be a part of russia ... not even russians , the problem with them is that they don \u00b4 t get to choose . 
  good one !, 
  ... hehehe, 
  sex exists for reproduction . 
  i agree on the percentages you give about sex and pleasure . 
  adaptation to mammal \u00b4 s sexual behavior ? 
  it \u00b4 s a self destruction behavior in terms of human survivor ; how can that be an adaptation ? 
  it \u00b4 s a bug in human development that probably always existed ... 
  the human mind can \u00b4 t understand the world and the universe we live in . 
  how is she in conditions to respond to the question if god exists or don \u00b4 t exists ? 
  ... sorry pal , but not you , not me not anyone is in conditions to give one definitive answer to that !, 
  in their position you would probably be in favor on the guy in charge ... survival, 
  god exists . 
  usa is forcing eu to get their shit together , raise an army and defend what they stand for against the evil russia and the psychopath putin and friends, 
  not a sin ( for religious people maybe ) ... but more a system error ; not a bad thing if you consider that outliers are part of human development ... 
  fruits : apples , pear , grapes , figs , blackberry , sloes tomato salads ( still hot with temperatures near 30\u00bac ), 
  ahhh france and her race to the bottom ... 
   portubro something you made up or this word exists somewhere ? 
  ... if so , why portubro ? 
  why doesn \u00b4 t nato uses the same technique as russia , to fighr the pro-russian side ; special forces and equipment with no mark ... 
  my personal feeling and some people i talk too ... prices are basically the same for several years , and in some cases even lower . 
  [ for instance ] ( http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/portugueses-compram-cada-vez-menos-marcas-da-distribuicao-1668687 ) : supermarkets are seeing a rise in brand products sells compared with the `` no brand products '' ; big producers like nestle and p&g are making promotions and in case of similar prices with the no brand , people choose to buy the brand products . 
  clothes and shoes stores are always running promotions . 
  uk and france are in europe , and if they intended to use them only if attacked , a nuclear attack on a nato country by russia could only result in a nato response , so ... 
  i don \u00b4 t see your point . 
  it \u00b4 s still a threat ... so i think i \u00b4 m still right . 
  from my point of view : the status quo is going down are they are doing what they can and can \u00b4 t to prevent it or delaying it ... 
  pussies ... 
  yeah ... 
  i don \u00b4 t know where i get this ideas ; let \u00b4 s face it ... this have never happened before and we have no reason to distrust the numbers of big corporations and governments . 
  w. . w. . . well and why \u00b4 s that ? 
  m. . . m. . . maybe the world economy is going to stalling and we go along ; not even the artificial and anemic grow of the us and britain can change that ; this is not that us and britain are using a better strategy than eurozone . 
  the all world economy is fucked up and we all are going down ... 
  well , no ... but fuck the past , we \u00b4 re living in the present and the questions is : are we going to seat and watch russia invasion of their neighbor countries , or are we going to do something to prevent it ? 
  if we \u00b4 re going to do something , what and when ? 
  your indicator isn \u00b4 t feasible : they are printing money to collect more taxes , fueling more economic bubbles , low unemployment and still people are struggling ( even employed ones ) , inflation problems and currency devaluation ( dollar ) ; and yet their debt keeps rising [ us ] ( http://useconomy.about.com/od/usdebtanddeficit/a/national-debt-by-year.htm#&amp;newsissues ) and [ britain ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/ ) . 
  there \u00b4 s also the possibility of manipulation of the indicators by the governments , meaning that situation in the real economy can be worst than that portrayed by the numbers . 
  you can not analyze the economy using 1 indicator ; that is what was done until now and it proves is a shitty way to do things ; man even the books can be cooked and your metrics are worthless in that case . 
  in case of an aggression to a nato member state the numbers can escalate quickly on the west side ... so this map is almost useless, 
   bundesbank will be thrilled . 
  hello inflation . 
  there \u00b4 s a deflation problem in eurozone, 
   another cold war is exactly what the eu/us want yeah , right ... but the boots and the equipment fighting ukrainian troops in the east are russian ... 
  i like this pathetic idea that us and britain are doing fine with their economies and eurozone is in a mess ... that is so naive ... 
  europe not nato should deploy troops in ukraine and kick russia \u00b4 s ass ... ** europe should declare war on russia ** ... 
  they won \u00b4 t use nuclear weapons because we too can use them . 
  the sentence is independent of the context ... 
  apparently russia has started the attack on mariupol ** edit : ** your despair is understandable , but looking at the facts : russian hasn \u00b4 t grabbed more ukrainian ground because of the west support to ukraine ; since the start of this conflict i \u00b4 ve seen battle meals and several non lethal equipment on ukrainian troops ; imf has allocated several millions to support ukraine economy ; several countries have sent equipment and nato is doing training drills and intel, 
  let me guess ... non euro zone countries are seeing a house prices boom ? 
  ... well there goes your qe money ... free money, 
  truces ? 
  ... and what are the conditions ? 
  nato should deploy troops in ukraine ; it \u00b4 s the only language putin \u00b4 s friends will grasp , and unlike escalating the war can even deter her, 
  ok ... we have some investors here who lost their money in bes ( bank ) bankruptcy , months after someone told them that it was a good investment ; they will go haply now , put their remaining money in france . 
  this isis guys are setting a new record on how low people can get, 
  `` brave heart '' moment, 
  nothing to see here ... business as usual , go on ... xuxuxuxu, 
  ahhh ... china and her almighty presence in resolving international conflicts , like ... ???? 
  ... can \u00b4 t remenber now, 
  it \u00b4 s the reunion of the axis of evil ... 
  i think more logistical help to ukraine fight this war is a good thing ... but i have to accept that this cause massive human losses in the ukrainian side . 
  i also think that people are underestimating the effects of the economic sanctions against russia ... bring down russian economy and with time putin \u00b4 s regime and russia itself will fall from inside . 
  when do we start to dismantle russia and sell it to the chinese ? 
  i think russia already reach the `` point of no return '', 
  someone should explain to mr. putin that : it \u00b4 s best not to mess with eu, 
  europe is a much bigger economy than russia , so i think any sanctions against russia will always hit more russia than europe ;, 
  it \u00b4 s time to teach those russia thugs that you don \u00b4 t mess with europe and get away with it ... it \u00b4 s time to russia taste a little of `` freedom '', 
  why doesn \u00b4 t eu and nato send special operations troops to east ukraine and even in russian soil to , for instance destroy the terrorist camps ? 
  ... and deny everything that kremlim says ; why not bring hell to russian border ? 
   offering attractive pay attracts the most talented people , ... bullshit !, 
  the west should destroy russia economy and send `` rebel fighters '' to defend ukraine, 
  let \u00b4 s just declare war on russia, 
  so this is what the losers side looks like !, 
  since when does russia has humanitarian worries ? 
  ... the ruling elite in kremlin doesn \u00b4 t even give a fuck about his own people , ... 
  well the future of europe is in the east ... probably is only a matter of time . 
  the old europe is part of history, 
  the ways people need to go to keep themselves in power !, 
  so does france and britain ... the difference is that some of you guys don \u00b4 t know that ... yet !, 
  lol, 
  southern countries are nicer ... you can almost feel that sun ... 
  troll brigade in 3,2,1 , ... 
  we need new and different economic theories ... and this economists aren \u00b4 t able to respond to that ; because we also need new economists that came from different areas other than traditional economic schools, 
  i thought us foreign policies where responsible for all the world problems ... now this guys are using oil money to finance terrorist who kill civilians ? 
  football is all about corruption ... from fifa directors to small country leagues ... 
  i was actually referring to buddhist in tibet ... but i see your point, 
  that \u00b4 s the true ... but people don \u00b4 t want the true , they want money ... so they do and say what they need to keep the status quo . 
  your argument is based on the idea that if islam is bad is because bad people took over it ; history proves that all other religions , including christianity , when used by bad people caused a lot of suffering . 
  true . 
  but in the same periods of history when christianity was used by bad people to cause harm to people , islam was also used that way ... nowadays apparently only islam is the bad apple of religions, 
  the more poor a country is , the more people own their homes ... makes perfect sense .
