  the only grave mistake here was greece entering the euro, 
   close the fucking border greece closing the border is not for people to get in , is for greeks don \u00b4 t get out . 
  wtf ? 
  well didn \u00b4 t saw that coming ... 
  i guess someone forgot to take their pills today ... 
  thanks to the cleverness of this new greek government , greece is doing so much better now ... this guys are real good ... 
  i bet they had worked in college before they went to the government !, 
  ... only smart and illuminated people give classes in college ; i \u00b4 m sure greece is on the right path now, 
   but european leaders , instead of devoting their summits to the question of how to best defend our economic and military interests , agonise over what to do about greece . 
  greece is the weakest link in the chain  i only hope that no one in athens dreams that debt forgiveness and grexit offer an alternative path to growth . 
  lol  but the euro can not be a substitute for further political integration . 
  indeed , without such integration , the euro can not survive -- and today , greece stands in the way of it . 
  just let them rot and move on ... federalized europe stronk, 
  yes i watched ... british authorities are putting the pressure on truck companies to limit the migrants entering uk , like : `` we have free movement of people in and out of the uk to france , but in any case you will get fined if the entering is made using your truck '' ... it \u00b4 s hypocrite and cynical game from british authorities, 
  so the only concern here from the british is to keep migrants away from british soil ... 
  they have no right to be there because they committed the crime to born in the wrong side of the fence, 
   also , no foreign banks are greece 's creditors lol, 
  if putin says it \u00b4 s true then probably it \u00b4 s true , because ... he \u00b4 s just a reliable source ... 
  there \u00b4 s your old age population solution, 
  it \u00b4 s just a stupid piece of paper , ideological charged ... use your brain cells and start thinking for yourself , for a change, 
  and you \u00b4 re so naive that think that after greek \u00b4 s default there will be a stupid constitution to protect greece from an euro exit, 
   they were elected on the promise ... you \u00b4 re so naive that my heart cries !!, 
  ... jesus is politicians is what they do ... promise ... this doesn \u00b4 t mean that will happen, 
  well ... your government is doing a good business in accomplishing an euro zone exit ... 
  greece strategy is that stupid because it \u00b4 s meant to fail ... they want to leave the euro because they are finding it hard to hijack the commission to their own pleasure, 
  let me add ; dance : [ pauliteiros ] ( https://youtu.be/1vkcf-kfgmq ) food : [ bacalhau com batatas a murro ] ( http://www.francogomes.com/blog_imagens/bacalhau_02.jpg ) [ polvo \u00e1 lagareiro ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5513/10913267863_8e88cb3967_b.jpg ) jobs : [ arte x\u00e1vega ( fishing ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/seine_fishing_in_portugal%2c_at_praia_da_sa%c3%bade_beach%2c_costa_da_caparica_%282%29.jpg/1024px-seine_fishing_in_portugal%2c_at_praia_da_sa%c3%bade_beach%2c_costa_da_caparica_%282%29.jpg ), 
  in case of war with russia ... do we need to attack greece too ? 
  just part of the propaganda ... 
  puff ... portugal is almost like this from ages, 
   has pushed eu leaders to ** consider ** concessions to keep the country in the fold . 
  nice try putin, 
  is there any tolerated minority to those northern europe people ? 
  if you don \u00b4 t go out so much and meet new people , the only ones you get to admire it \u00b4 s you and your \u00b4 s house mirror ... 
  but devaluation doesn \u00b4 t solve nothing ... to compete in a globalized economy you need to have value added products and services , you can not compete on cheap prices, 
  let \u00b4 s face it , it \u00b4 s to late ... greek people will wake up one day and the country is already bankrupted, 
   increases export man you don \u00b4 t know what you say ; that idea that if you have cheap products people will buy them , hence raising exports , is only theoretical . 
  even china is selling less and less `` cheap products '', 
  like i said there \u00b4 s no solution ; it will be like this for years to come . 
  and this won \u00b4 t stop in greece . 
  12 months salary payment working for the state ? 
  forget it ... only get 8 ; same with pensions ... 
  6 % vat for medicine , books and theatres and 11 % - 23 % for the food ? 
  isn \u00b4 t more important to have cheaper food than cheaper books ? 
  after all this months a syriza break up would be like : what the fuck this people went there in the first place ? 
  this is like watching a bad quality soap opera, 
  i didn \u00b4 t downvote you . 
  when that happens we talk again, 
  i don \u00b4 t get it ; this has nothing to do with morality and `` teach the greeks a lesson '' ... greece is simply not viable as a state ; their governments can \u00b4 t make the reforms the country needs , after a serious of disastrous decisions by their governments , led greece to this point ... again and again ; greece history is full of bankruptcies . 
  this is probably a cultural problem in greece ... they don \u00b4 t have what it takes do evolve , reform and grow as a country, 
  did i said something wrong ? 
  i don \u00b4 t see any solution to greece . 
  i think you have problems dealing with reality, 
  save greece ? 
  ... how can greece be saved ? 
  ... it \u00b4 s a dead end road ; greece is like the venezuela of europe or the new som\u00e1lia, 
  let \u00b4 s face it , creditor can lose part or a substantial part of the money they lend to greece , but greece needs the creditors every day to pay the bills ... 
  i don \u00b4 t see what \u00b4 s here to negotiate, 
  and if creditors don \u00b4 t want to negotiate the terms ? 
  negotiate what ? 
  when a bank crashes and burns is not only the bankers that get in trouble ... the customers to ; just tell the people they lost their savings because the bank went bust . . 
  and what \u00b4 s the greek plan or plans ? 
  well there are several points in favour of that perspective of `` fascists red scare '' : 1 - putin is actually financing extreme groups in europe , with the clear plan to divide europe , because an united one is a menace to russia ; 2 - people are actually tired of current state of affairs in europe , economic and political speaking , and see any opposition to the status quo as a good thing ; so people are an easy prey to extreme groups financed by putin to divide, 
  didn \u00b4 t get what you said ... please explain, 
  those anarchists destroying property are a disgrace ... they show to be organized , probably financed by putin, 
  damn ... that street theatre is very good, 
  who the fuck cares ? 
  no ... unlike you i \u00b4 m educated and i know how things should work !, 
  right ; as if greek debt would disappear if greece leaves ... it just makes it more unsustainable, 
  lisboa is a shit hole i agree ... give me one example of ** not ** a shit hole, 
  yes, 
  every developed world has his problems ... the difference with greece is the lack of total planning in all structures of society ... greece is ruled by incompetent ... this makes them in the level of africa \u00b4 s countries, 
  your \u00b4 re not a serious person . 
  your changing subjects ; greece is a shit hole that gives euro a bad name ; portugal has is structural problems and unlike greece is resolving them in a sense matter ; i don \u00b4 t like you ... our conversations end here . 
  maybe . 
  and you should face the fact that greece is an undeveloped country . 
  greece is the weakest link for some reason ... stop pretending and face reality . 
  greece is a 3rd world country ; the level of development is more similar to africa \u00b4 s countries and turkey than a western country ... 
  they should never have entered the euro, 
  clashes happen because they are not integrated in the host country ; either because the host country failed to integrated them or they failed to integrate themselves ... anyway the host country should find a solution , even repatriate them if it need to ... 
  central & east europe ... damn ... the peace time there was only to gather troops to another round there \u00b4 s a thing called tables and chairs ... so people can sit together and talk about problems instead of grabbing a gun !, 
  diversity makes us strong as a society , not weaker has some bad people want us to think, 
   greek democracy greece has a democracy ? 
  i thought democracy was only for the top elite ... the rest had to scrap for a living, 
  who cares about russia anyway, 
  this british holidaymakers should be beheaded ... nothing important would be lost, 
  not so far in the future : russia ... the revolution bloodshed !, 
  but i thought syriza won the elections because greeks didn \u00b4 t wanted to leave the euro ? 
  [ they all have more than 70 % debt by % gdp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_debt#/media/file:dept.svg ) people are living on debt, 
  secret ? 
  ... it \u00b4 s all over the news ... nothing new from a long time ago, 
  those this means that our elites will be living elsewhere ? 
  ... that would be nice, 
   this feeling that nothing will be better . 
  you \u00b4 re right i \u00b4 m not there ; i can \u00b4 t judge greeks because of that ? 
  i don \u00b4 t think so . 
  this feeling that you \u00b4 re talking about , that supposedly led greeks to commit suicide , is a feeling of someone who has no alternatives in life ; you know who has no alternatives in life ? 
  the migrants who cross the mediterranean sea every day to an almost certain dead . 
  you guys have beautiful weather , beaches , land and a government that doesn \u00b4 t chase his population at gun point ... grow up . 
  my media ? 
  i use essential the net to get my news ... several sources of news,
