  syriza like their russia \u00b4 s friends are the propaganda master race . 
  they deny realities in order to accomplish their interests , while greece is sinking with the eu trying to save what no one else wants to save ... greece, 
  where are they ... 
  i only see show off and no work, 
  [ `` propaganda master race '' ] ( http://imgur.com/okbfepw ) - the state of denial, 
  this countries can not have peace again ... there \u00b4 s to much ate, 
  how can greece be committed to reforms when it \u00b4 s unable to collect taxes from tax dodgers and the wealthy criminals to support the vulnerable parts of society to the crisis ? 
  what a stupid thing to do on a sunday afternoon ... what happened to the shopping malls ? 
  83 mln of fake euros entering the market, 
   greek simply will never be able to repay all of its debts , which currently stand at 175 % with current economy ... no . 
  but imagine in the future greece starts to export oil ? 
  ... or something similar . 
  creditors don \u00b4 t want greece to default and greece wants to default ; they both have to give in . 
  hate ? 
  well , no wonder greece is bankrupted ... again, 
  the craft is not the same as the israel counterpart ... the russian version has the propeller in the front of the plane , not in the back like the israel \u00b4 s version . 
  https://twitter.com/ukrwatchtower/status/601279974285451266 those this means that israel is helping russia ? 
  ( israel \u00b4 s directional antenna as part of the russian drone ), 
  the guy being spanked is no saint ; went to high tension football match with his family , and is clear that is being aggressive to the police officer, 
  outrage my ass, 
  the ones who get jailed ... 
  this ones nothing will happen to them, 
  that \u00b4 s inside trading ... people get jailed because of that ... well some small people at least, 
  next they will discover that life can be fun and not a pain in the ass ... 
  wow ... those nordics are gaining some mediterranean brains, 
  yes, 
  libya has a government ? 
  you can almost feel the sexual tension in the air ... 
  no one likes the russians ... not even themselves, 
  that \u00b4 s sad ... it \u00b4 s the same of saying that we can \u00b4 t defend ourselves or that we are too incompetent in doing it, 
  why aren \u00b4 t eu troops strolling through romania ? 
  he \u00b4 s got a point , actually several of them ... 
  the guys wearing dresses don \u00b4 t want the guys wearing trousers to drink alcohol ... oh boy this is going to be fun, 
  of course not . 
  but there \u00b4 s not a solution ... at least a solution that depends solely on the greeks ; is not a solution it \u00b4 s damage control . 
  there \u00b4 s not a receipt that if you follow you will be fine ... at least a political feasible solution ; because if greece would live by it \u00b4 s means , with minimal help from outside , cuts from the state would be probably massive ; like instead of receiving a paycheck of 1000,00 $ at the end of the month , you would had to receive like 200,00 $ ... this is not doable , at least political . 
  greek economy needs to devalue a lot more because is not sustainable ( salaries and reforms and subsidies ... way down ) ... and this is probably one of the only solutions to greece because as a failed state , government can \u00b4 t collect properly taxes and distribute sacrifice in a fairly way , to all levels of society, 
  is not hard to believe that the suggested measures were fundamentally wrong ... 
  i believe that no economist has the solution for the current economic crisis , so is not hard to believe in that , and ? 
  ... your point is ? 
  i didn \u00b4 t said that greece didn \u00b4 t reform ; i think greece didn \u00b4 t reform enough , or probably the level of reform that greece needs is not doable ; anyways the result is that greece is going to be left to rot ... but that is just my opinion, 
   just because it does n't suit your bias . 
  i \u00b4 m the one who has a biased thought , but greece is the one in a dead end road ... right, 
  they are only stealing your jobs because native people don \u00b4 t want them , dickhead, 
  from the strategical point of view it was clear what was done by the greek government ; when it had to choose between fight internal enemies , like the corrupt oligarchs or smaller tax dodgers , it choose external enemies like international lenders . 
  probably it had to be that way to unite the greek people ... but it was a strategy meant to fail , because it \u00b4 s common sense you can not hostility people you need to pay the bills ... maybe this option was taken because of internal greek problems , probably the same problems that are surfacing now of a failed state . 
  you numbers and your graphic meant almost nothing ... 2008 crisis showed that numbers can be rigged to represent the reality i want them to represent . 
  greek state of affairs tell a different reality of your graphs . 
  failed or not failed institutions , i can also say that greece failed to implement them ; in fact , for me , and this is my personal opinion , not only greece failed to implement the reforms but greece is also a failed state, 
  to be respected you need also to give yourself to the respect of others and the institutions who manage our lives, 
  i don \u00b4 t see greece ... ? 
  ... already left the eu ? 
  good ... big corporations are managed by highly corrupt people . 
  better the public knows what they are up to . 
   bad putin decided to invade western europe not going to happen ... only ukraine is too big to russia to swallow , and also west europe as more technological developed and better prepared forces , than russia, 
  impressive show of force and power ... it \u00b4 s impressive how people get stuck in the past , unable to move on with their life , and it \u00b4 s kind of sad that this show of power it \u00b4 s a military one ... 
  it would be nicer a visit to the circus . 
  that \u00b4 s breathtaking ... especially when they died so that a few people maintain their power, 
  the tyranny of the majority ... like a highly subsidized society knows what \u00b4 s best for me ; assuming that all the people go to vote , because a 66 % abstention just reduce the legitimacy of the vote to shreds, 
  that will be fun ; it \u00b4 s like an old lady that still thinks that she \u00b4 s very important to the rest of the family , but everyone is taking care of their own life and she \u00b4 s left in the room alone shouting orders . 
  and what does greeks know about the truth of almost anything ? ... 
  they been living in a fairy tale all this years with the results we see now . 
   pensions below the poverty line with the few in work paying for this pensions `` below the poverty line '' ... because the ones receiving them never discounted enough for what they receive, 
  let \u00b4 s keep the privileges we have , with somebody else paying for them ... sounds like a plan with everything to workout fine, 
  this anti-neoliberalism movements are pathetic ; this guy is saying that the financial sector is creating difficulties to the economy , so he \u00b4 s against neoliberalism ... what \u00b4 s the alternative to fix the problems of what people call neoliberalism ? 
  ** facts of life ** : euro will prevail and will replace the dollar as world trade currency ... 
  the confirmation of the disaster that i thought they would be, 
  ussr all over again . 
  how many times they have to be defeated until they get the point ? 
  ironic ... apparently you haven \u00b4 t noticed that greece is in serious troubles, 
  clearly this is an international conspiracy to defeat greek government , because creditors don \u00b4 t want to receive greek money ... just go on business as usual , everything will end up fine ... 
  this kind of mafias are everywhere ... it just doesn \u00b4 t worth the risk of exposing them ... fuck them, 
   `` their interest may be to put people first , before the banks , but their handling of negotiations has been a mess and their tenure very disappointing . '' people aren \u00b4 t very smart . 
  now they are going to put the blame on bad negotiation tactics . 
  i guess that is easier than admitting that they where wrong in the first place . 
  let \u00b4 s legalize criminal activities so we can collect taxes, 
  a lot of powers outside and inside greece , want greece to fail , ... a lot of people will make a lot of money with this ... and in the end it \u00b4 s always the powerless that are left behind , who have to pay the bill, 
   in which it specifies that payments will be made `` in euros or any national greek currency at the time '' probably sticks , because any other greek currency will be worth less than sticks, 
  if i had the power to , i would make certainty this guys where captured by isis ... beheaded them, 
  this is really bad, 
  krugman !, 
  you can kiss my austerity ass, 
  putin is preparing his country for war, 
  at night he puts is cape and it \u00b4 s : '' ** v ** - for varoufakis '' he \u00b4 s going save all debtors from the claws of evil creditors ... he \u00b4 s going to save greece first , then the world ... one person at a time, 
  portugal rocks ... 
  stupid people need mantras to divert attention on the things that real matter and that mess with powerful people, 
  so let \u00b4 s forget crimea an move on ... business as usual ? 
  ... wtf ? 
  errrr ... muslims ? 
  why are there so many problems with the muslim world ? 
  not only in muslim countries ( war ) , but also problems with muslims in europe . 
  it it because they tend to isolate themselves by their culture , from westerns ? 
   someone in their 20s then the answer is no so they like westerns ... can \u00b4 t cook , can \u00b4 t clean ... basically their are only good for bed !, 
  ... well some not even their are good !, 
  it doesn \u00b4 t ???

  click on the first link in the results page . 
  so greeks are sodomized not only by lenders but by other greeks who will profit from the dracma ... sounds like a nice place to live !, 
  lol, 
  greece does everything wrong ... it should n \u00b4 t be varoufakis their finance minister ; varoufakis is a theoretic ; it should be a pragmatic finance minister who knows what life is and how hard it is ... not only for greek sake but for the all world .
