  let \u00b4 s harm russia ... let \u00b4 s hope russia became a decadent society , with a mafia kind of state apparatus where people are condemn to poverty , illiteracy and the rule of law of the worst kind of criminals alive ... wait , that already . . 
  i got a lot of excuses for that , a very long list, 
  my excuse ? 
  for what ? 
  i don \u00b4 t like greece too ... corrupt and incompetent, 
  lol, 
  unlike greece , portugal pays back the borrowed money ... that \u00b4 s the catch , got it ? 
  of course they donate it ... it isn \u00b4 t their money, 
  yeah right, 
  in a sense yes ; this it \u00b4 s a war , and you need to define your values in order to defend them . 
  i don \u00b4 t think you can fight a war with extreme islam using democracy, 
   i do n't do everything a church expects a good christian to do . 
  good just don \u00b4 t replace a church for a state, 
   what do you mean when you say that europe lacks values ? 
  the family value has been lost for instance ; big families of hard working people , that sacrifice their lives in order to raise their kids . 
  we now live in a materialist society , where people want the easy way out of a problem , and everything that goes with it ... people don \u00b4 t believe any more in something bigger than themselves ; pseudo smart people are atheists , and can not see that they are serving an leftist agenda of getting rid of the church , to replace her for the state , a big one , with big power . 
  i \u00b4 m not defending the church here , it has also a lot of problems . 
   euthanasia , divorce , alcohol , and trying to to be inclusive have to do with , '' lack of spirituality '' ? 
  euthanasia , divorce , abortion , less children 's because we \u00b4 re more individualist are part of some kind of death agenda ... this it \u00b4 s death not life ; alcohol and anti depressive consummation it \u00b4 s just a symptom that people aren \u00b4 t happy with this materialist , individualists very consensual society . 
   you ca n't think of the pros and cons of euthanasia when you are christian ? 
  of course you can , but they need to be discussed not in this culture of ... let \u00b4 s get rid of the church and replace her with a big state agenda . 
   if you are spiritual , does this mean you do n't want to be inclusive ? 
  you are inclusive until a certain point ; islam it \u00b4 s the culture of fear , and extreme islam it \u00b4 s not inclusive ; we can not include this people in our society , because they don \u00b4 t follow our rules . 
  you can have muslins in europe ... but they have to follow our rules . 
   are n't we discussing multiculturalism right now ? 
  yes , and you know what , it \u00b4 s this multiculturalism we \u00b4 re discussing know that it \u00b4 s promoted by the left , not because it \u00b4 s inclusive , but because it needs a big repressive state to control the inclusive people . 
  that \u00b4 s the end game of the left multiculturalism . 
   is n't it kind of creepy and weird to promote spirituality in service of nationalism ? 
  it \u00b4 s not nationalism . 
  we are a multi culture eu ; we just need to draw the line on multiculturalism inclusive people, 
  i like stefan molyneux , and i think this points he and his guest raise in the interview are spot on ; this lack of spirituality in modern europe , where every one tries to be inclusive , even with non inclusive muslims , this lack of values , christian values , that are the foundation of europe , this dead culture of euthanasia , lack of children , people getting divorced or not even getting married , anti depressive pills consummation , alcohol consummation ... it \u00b4 s killing europe and it \u00b4 s cultural heritage ; people need values , family values , to fight extreme islam ... if we have only democracy , we will loose, 
  did you actually saw the video ? 
  it \u00b4 s actually very accurate in finding the symptoms of this fight we \u00b4 re having on extreme islam . 
  holy shit ... the world can be saved ? 
   under the oslo accords - signed stopped reading there, 
   `` portuguese students who are in poland since april 3 , under a student exchange program - erasmus + - have been victims of racism by the local population , in part because they are mistaken for muslims  stanislaw augustine , one of the portuguese host and the responsible teacher , reported the case to the polish authorities , which , however , have identified the aggressor . 
  this is 38 years old military , with 11 years of experience in the military and who has already served a mission in afghanistan . 
   stanislaw augustine , fearing for their safety , took them to the hostel where they were staying and moved them to a house on the outskirts of town , hiring , including private security guards for their protection . 
  during their stay , students have been insulted in english and in polish in the streets , on buses , in shops and markets , and been the target of obscene gestures . 
   `` as a pole , i am ashamed that citizens of other countries are direct target of racist comments , '' lamented augustine , quoted by a portuguese newspaper . 
  `` the polish students were in portugal and were greeted warmly , thought , kind and friendly . 
  portuguese students come here and these things happen , `` blurted '' wtf is wrong with this people ? 
  retard people doing retard things, 
   we live in a sad era for democracy . 
  that \u00b4 s because we \u00b4 re in a war, 
  portugal ... can \u00b4 t you see the flag ? 
   misogynistic oppression of women and violence are you stupid enough to think i was referring to this ? 
   infantile nonsense . 
  yeah right , every knows about how antisocial northern people are ... they live in self-imposed ghettos and much of them only talk to close relatives, 
   who are unapologetically unwilling to assimilate the preexisting and dominant civic virtues . 
  what it \u00b4 s so difficult to understand ? 
  muslim migrants don \u00b4 t want to assimilate a hosting culture , in the same sense that the hosting culture don \u00b4 t want to assimilate them . 
  i think it \u00b4 s obvious that everyone here has virtues to put on the table . 
  ** edit ** : the drama here is that the migrants went to the north richer parts of europe that are also the most antisocial ones . 
  is that what it looks like ? 
  ... a russian military column crossing the water ... shit, 
   who will benefit from pretending that the `` eu institutions are perfectly functional '' ? 
  eu institutions have problems like everything else ... but problems to be resolved with the work of people , doesn \u00b4 t mean that the all system is collapsing . 
  who can benefict from eu implosion ? 
  ... a lot of people , even nations , investors ... a lot of smart people that have a voice on the media , said that the euro crisis and all the economic crisis in eu , and especially in countries like greece , would doom the eu ... well , greece is still in the eu and we are all here , so ... 
  i \u00b4 ve crossed the spanish-portuguese border this week and i \u00b4 ve hardly noticed that . 
  the fact that controls are up in some points doesn \u00b4 t mean the system as an all it \u00b4 s collapsing ... probably it \u00b4 s just adapting to new realities . 
   and what is the russia agenda supposed to be ? 
  take a wild guess  eu is in deep trouble because the political institutions of the schengen and singel currency are flawed and severely dysfunctional . 
  no it \u00b4 s not . 
  eu institutions are perfectly functional . 
  what it \u00b4 s dysfunctional it \u00b4 s news about their supposedly dis functionality . 
   eus own survival is doubtful . 
  no it \u00b4 s not ... except if you serve the russian agenda, 
  he thought he could win the war , didn \u00b4 t it ? 
  since russia became relevant, 
  well ... icij is financed by george soros , cia ... and the big names that came out until now , are almost of non western countries , like russia ... so ... maybe ... he has a point ... ?? 
  no , heaven, 
  just a different cover my ass ... there \u00b4 s no resemblance with the past . 
  [ there \u00b4 s only one flag ] ( http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01837/flag6_1837773a.jpg ), 
  this is going to be fun . 
  holy shit ... name and adress ? 
  ... what can go wrong ? 
  very cool , well structured and sober design ... 
  lol, 
  ** i only saw the video , and in the video he did \u00b4 t said that **, 
  ** i don \u00b4 t think he said that ** ; what he said , and it \u00b4 s backed up by facts , it \u00b4 s that european intelligent services has been failing miserably in france and now in belgium . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t make any sense people being armed . 
  the self-defence reasons people like you proclaim are a security forces matter ; if people start using guns in their pockets and pursues , then i \u00b4 m entitled to have a gun myself , just in case someone looses his mind in the street when i \u00b4 m passing ; this will end in an arms race and the general population killing one another . 
  sorry but i don \u00b4 t believe this has nothing to do with islam or religion ; it \u00b4 s a different agenda . 
  the guy couldn \u00b4 t save greece , and now wants to save europe ? 
  this terrorist attacks look like the fight against isis . 
  the politicians show up on tv with harsh words against terrorist and then , trucks full of cargo to isis controlled territory show up in turkey border with syria ... this all stinks, 
  whatever ... the assimilation failed and now we see some of the results . 
  the seed was planted when their parents where putted in ghettos , whether by their own options or imposed by the rest of the hosting society, 
  the refugees are being used by crazy people with their paid agendas to destabilize europe . 
  eastern european countries and england are doing the enemy job , with their anti migrant propaganda and policies . 
  ** edit ** : history will judge those countries against migrants ... and they eventually pay for being in the wrong side of the fence . 
  people are depressing, 
  i bet the ones not sunk/disabled just ran away as fast as they could . 
  it depends on who \u00b4 s asking ... 
  good ... so europe just needs to keep accepting refugees , show them the good life so one day they can return to their home countries and stablish close economic and diplomat relations with eu . 
  it \u00b4 s an investment in the future then . 
  cool, 
  well , migrants should be registered in the first country they enter ...
