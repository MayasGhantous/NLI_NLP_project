  don \u00b4 t mess with the propaganda guys ... i \u00b4 m lizard the king i can sell you anything, 
  isn \u00b4 t he confusing eu with italy ? 
  hahaha ... \u00d3rban is going to build a better fence to protect europe from those people that want to menace our superior way of living !, 
  i like all europe ... they have more positive things than negative ones . 
  some one should tell them about [ this ] ( https://videos.sapo.pt/etf8rndr3y0q0fwkofey ), 
  i got ta say i \u00b4 m curious on the intel the secret services have on me ... maybe they know stuff about me that i don \u00b4 t. 
  or maybe i \u00b4 m not that important , who knows . 
  just ask the nsa ... why double the work ? 
  that \u00b4 s not multiculturalism ... that \u00b4 s lost , brain washed , youth . 
  too late ... 
  why they have to be naked and why they are all men ? 
  this all thing of war it \u00b4 s just nonsense ... 
  people are shit ... just watch people \u00b4 s attitude in any organization with more than 2 persons ... 
  the war in the middle east , how people treat their fellow man when in a situation of power over the other . 
  i \u00b4 m afraid your lost faith in humanity it \u00b4 s perfectly reasonable, 
   athens was failing to observe its obligations it \u00b4 s good to know that some things ... never change , 
  the vultures of the right where always circling , and europe in not dying , on the contraire . 
   but whom would you blame then for all your bullshit . 
  they would find someone , believe me ... they always have some else to blame, 
   and i ca n't help myself but wonder , why ? 
  probably because the hoax of prosperity in the western world it \u00b4 s coming to shreds , and they need a war to `` entertain '' the masses, 
   dry water actually consists of 95 % liquid water , but the silica coating prevents the water droplets from combining and turning back into a bulk liquid that \u00b4 s not water !, 
  no comment on the square wheel, 
  in another news flash : the water is wet and the wheel is round ; ... keep tune in for more info in a minute . 
  this is portugal ; people here are too dumb to start a war and smart enough not to die in one . 
  well history books don \u00b4 t give votes , do they ? 
  i think the problem it \u00b4 s deeper than simply make up on the regime , so it looks more attractive to people participate . 
  the hierarchical power structures of the industrial revolution are slowing dying ; in the 21st century we need a network collaborative economic and governance structures . 
  in this regime i have to choose the less evil , the people i trust more to make decisions for me ... and if i want to take my own decisions in my hand ? 
  apparently the last news say that they where all african migrants ... which it \u00b4 s weird when in the initial news from the incidents , i recall being named german citizens among the offenders, 
  we probably need a new democratic system ; what \u00b4 s the point of all this voting when there \u00b4 s a big probability of more than 50 % of the voters don \u00b4 t even vote ? 
  it \u00b4 s a sadomasochistic thing ... 
  so that \u00b4 s how the end of the world looks like !, 
  correct . 
  a lot of people don \u00b4 t know portugal or where it is ; some run away for economic reasons , and portugal it \u00b4 s not attractive for that matter , others want to go next to their families , and there are some that just want peace ... this last group isn \u00b4 t hard to bring to portugal . 
  thanks to all countries blocking a response to this crisis ... because of their own political agendas . 
  just add `` ya '' ... 
  in portugal they would be all crowded in the bus stop to avoid the cold and the rain ( rarely snows ) ... more like [ this ] ( http://thumbs.sapo.pt/?p=http%3a%2f%2fsm1.imgs.sapo.pt%2fmb%2fl%2fs%2fo%2fp%2fvmij%2c6sd%2ctjjklzmjocbe6o_.jpg&amp;w=625&amp;h=468&amp;q=100 ), 
  looks like we have another [ sucessor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/flag_of_albania.svg/700px-flag_of_albania.svg.png ) , 
  i have to agree ... and i would add some more `` institutions '', 
  it \u00b4 s there anything left in syria to be destroyed by airstrikes ? 
  ... that country must be huge . 
  the leaders ? 
  ... probably ; but i take my chance that 99,9999 % of western population don \u00b4 t see russia as a friendly , prosperous place to live . 
   i think a lot of countries would die to have what putin in russia has . 
  lol, 
  what a joke ... the ones responsible for the attacks in cologne just need to be brought to justice like any other criminals ; anything more than that it \u00b4 s passing someone \u00b4 s agenda . 
   if you ask a citizen of one of the eu 's member states , it 's unlikely you will hear a positive word about the eu . 
  shut up . 
  no , they are just false flags ; the attackers probably had someone organizing them , with a political agenda . 
  there are 2 little buts in what you say : one it \u00b4 s inflation that rises with more money in the market ; the other it \u00b4 s that you assume that even with cheaper products to export there will be someone to buy them ; especially when you will be competing with the chinese . 
  i don \u00b4 t get it , what \u00b4 s so hard to understand that : printing more money to solve a debt problem it \u00b4 s not a solution ; structural problems in the economy need to be addressed ... but ok , it \u00b4 s not a very popular political measure to get your numbers right ; it \u00b4 s way more easy to give free money and just wait for things to work out ... 
  you just spoiled the comment i was about to make on this . 
  what will happen to the money that was already created by the commercial banks ? 
  everything stops ... now !, 
  [ here \u00b4 s an area in uk homeless can call home ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02934/anti-homeless-spik_2934649b.jpg ), 
  welcome to europe 2016 ; hope that when europeans time will came to flee this place , they will have a better treatment anywhere they went . 
  `` 149,5 more terrorists are on their way '' ... one blow himself up while trying to prepare his suicide jacket . 
  i \u00b4 m i missing anything here ? 
  direct [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/p979hai5qlk ) to the video, 
   theoretically speaking , portugal is also a spain . 
  in your dreams ; kicked your asses several times , and will kick the more times needed ... besides no one wants to be part of spain any way , not even their own regions . 
  if this it \u00b4 s not wwiii i don \u00b4 t know what it is, 
  they have to justify the millions spent on that shit ... even if it boils down to nothing, 
  they are used to fuck the younger generations ... it \u00b4 s a principle thing . 
  it has to be a fight in the parliament ? 
  you should check it out the ones that are already there . 
  let \u00b4 s not forget that hitler was democratic elected ... 
  this it \u00b4 s big stuff , and ... explains a lot, 
  now i \u00b4 m sad ... 
  lol, 
  so i assume it \u00b4 s ok to greece and hungary what \u00b4 s happening in the israel settlements ... 
  this is the only response a state can give in the short run ; move the military in ; but this it \u00b4 s clearly a social problem , with terrorist being recruited in france . 
  a military action will have a very limited effect , if not counter-productive , with the recruitment of more jihadist, 
  because this has worked in the past ... bush jr. can attest that . 
  it \u00b4 s kind of disturbing to watch people speaking on tv about the atrocities of this crimes , committed in paris , when this kind of stuff happens on a daily basis all over the world , especially in conflict zones , and it \u00b4 s like no one cares ; it \u00b4 s like we live in an artificial world , that from times to times get some doses of reality , and everything falls apart . 
  2\u00ba generation migrants . 
  don \u00b4 t feel integrated in the resident country and don \u00b4 t have ties with their parents homeland . 
  face it europe ; failing to integrate migrants and pushing them to ghettos it \u00b4 s a recipe to disaster . 
  run a scan on that face and tell me who he works for ? 
  ... on the other hand , who would be that stupid to be so fucking obvious ? 
  ... in front of the cameras ? 
  so poland it \u00b4 s taking advantage from this tragedy to pass her agenda ... 
  i think we deserve better treatment from poland , after all that happened in paris . 
  ** edit ** : poland , respect the victims and the relatives of this tragedy . 
  people i know that went to jerusalem said ... never again , thanks . 
  they went on those tourist excursions . 
  they complain about the militarization of the city . 
  what peace efforts ? 
  i only see land grab , death and destruction coming from that place, 
  the irony on those images ; the bad quality of the images makes people move like puppets ... like they all actually where . 
  is volkswagen the only one manipulating the emission tests ? 
  mexico of europe ? 
  on what basis ? 
  ... drugs cartels ? 
  i don \u00b4 t think so that \u00b4 s the best shot you can give ? 
  estonia ? 
  it \u00b4 s that a dish or something ? 
  you should admit that you lost the discussion , because clinton personal life isn \u00b4 t a prerequisite to be or not to be elected ; on the contrary a right wing xenophobic that publicize it it \u00b4 s another matter . 
   it means , that americans are atheists , liars and they tend to adultery , because what 's the other point of choosing such a president ?
