  the nytimes comment section is way better than any other comment sections i \u00b4 ve seen ... 
  you over rate people, 
  you are all a waste of time . 
  i \u00b4 m out, 
  like you said ** did ** maybe it \u00b4 s time for ee countries fo heal their wounds , or at least go on with their life 's and not being in constant afraid of a not existing invasion ; like i said before , is a stupid thing to do , putin \u00b4 s invasion of ee, 
  if i \u00b4 m panic of closed spaces i don \u00b4 t use the elevator , i use the stairs ; no matter the reasons ee countries have against russia i don \u00b4 t understand all the hysteria about a hypothetical invasion ... it \u00b4 s a stupid option for putin to invade ee countries . 
  by historic reasons ee countries are afraid of the big bear ; but this is only a collective hysteria , fuelled by the warmongers . 
  i get that russia is a bad unstable neighbour , with a violent past , and probably ee countries have all the reasons to fear/hate russia . 
  but let \u00b4 s be rational here ; russia can hardly handle crimea and eastern ukraine and invading ee countries will be a declaration of war against the west ... and if putin can be a lot of things isn \u00b4 t stupid , that \u00b4 s for sure . 
   are ready to kill and destroy just to prove themselves that they exist . 
  unfortunately to their victims , this whole `` battle '' exists only in russia 's sick imagination . 
  the same can be said from eastern european countries ; in this sub for instance , people are real afraid of russia and for them the russians are coming , so is perfectly reasonable the military build up by nato in those countries ... they supposedly fell more safe , with all those weapons and troops around them . 
  the same you said for russia can be said here , especially for eastern countries . 
  you don \u00b4 t understand shit, 
  the only military deterrence is called nuke . 
  what you are doing is creating an russian enemy , more or less fantasized , to promote your military agenda , to counter this more or less fictitious enemy . 
  i \u00b4 m not saying that russia or putin are trustworthy , but one thing i \u00b4 m sure , you are not trustworthy with your belligerent positions . 
   i agree , a lot of people in western europe do not really understand how much of a threat russia is . 
  says the guy that defend brexit as a good solution for the uk . 
  do us all a favour , go home , and don \u00b4 t quit your day job , because this subjects are clear not your strong predicates, 
  military what ? 
  your logic is hard to grasp ( not logic at all ) . 
  you don \u00b4 t avoid a conflict sending weapons to that `` conflict '' ; doing that will only ignite more the `` conflict '' ... the technical name for that is : escalation of the conflict, 
  portugal was an international power until very recently in human history , with colonies all over the world . 
  522 years ago portugal signed a deal with spain to divide the world between the 2 [ tordesillas treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) study history before bowing to portuguese power ; study anything by the level of your response ... makes you a better man . 
  it was a good vote then ... 
  not true ... 
  looks like the populist/nationalist is in the other side of the english channel this time ... 
  people are over rated, 
  eu believes is the budgets presented by the countries ? 
  ... they put there all they want , and especially what others want to ear . 
  for one suspicious person in a suspicious place to kill 2 cops at 2am , they have to be all smoking pot and drinking beer ... and even in this situation is not easy to kill two armed and trained men . 
   the study results relate to the population that can not meet financial needs in at least three of the nine following goods and services :  * payment of monthly bills ( such as rent , loan installments etc )  * food , which includes meat , fish or vegetables of an equivalent nutritional value every other day  * heating  * telecommunications  * color television  * washing machine  * passenger car  * week-long vacation none of this points is a sign of extreme poverty ; greek institutions shouldn \u00b4 t make fun and use people \u00b4 s suffering to get what they want ... because i strong believe that there \u00b4 s a lot of people suffering in greece ; shameful leaders . 
  why not both ? 
  ... it depends, 
  the article also mentions malta and greece support to russia ; not taking sides here , but this all situation in syria and the all middle east is beyond repair , totally fu ** up, 
  where can i watch this ? 
   just against stupid decisions in eu wtf of argument is that ? 
  ... life is not what you want , is what it is , is up to you to fight for what you believe is right for you . 
  the protesters used the tank against the police ? 
   the agency 's goal would be to `` embarrass '' top russian officials i mean , more than they embarrass themselves !, 
  i like that attitude ... eu only when it suits us , other time it can go ... it \u00b4 s so british, 
  wait ... i \u00b4 m going to grab some popcorn, 
  good point, 
  wtf is your problem italy ? 
  ... war is coming you need to choose sides !, 
  that ship didn \u00b4 t passed the inspection, 
  thanks for your knowledge comment . 
  do you think industrialization was a mistake ? 
  it \u00b4 s like a plague ... once the economy it \u00b4 s in a down phase , like it \u00b4 s suppose to be ... economic grow it \u00b4 s not eternal , low skilled workers , the most affected by a down cycle , start voting in this populists/nationalists like adolph hitler ;, 
  you hurt my feelings, 
  exit is that way -- , 
  oookkkk ... the problem is start thinking , them !, 
  because is part of recent racist attacks in the uk ... why not post it ? 
   mum please don \u00b4 t hurt me ... run for your life , mum is coming, 
  that could also be applied to any major government or corporation , especially when the world economy contracts ;, 
  more of a bad taste joke ; i just don \u00b4 t trust newspapers with economic news predictions , or the numbers they put on the table . 
  the idea i have , based on comments and opinions , is that newspapers around here are not a profitable business ; the big ones are keep by big corporations for propaganda purposes . 
  so you \u00b4 re trying to convince me that most of the newspapers around are profitable ? 
  `` booming '' ... is he referring to the economy or to isis militants ? 
  couldn \u00b4 t care less ... 
  also ... they take kids from portuguese parents living in the uk [ portuguese newspaper ] ( https://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/portuguesa-em-inglaterra-luta-para-recuperar-filho-que-lhe-foi-retirado-com-9-dias-1728625 ), 
  so unlike the french riviera , i don \u00b4 t like conchita wurst or burkas ... is this a problem to you ? 
  oh god ... now we \u00b4 re gon na have a conchita wurst dressed with a burka taking sun baths on french riviera ... 
  i would like to see brexiters backing up sturgeon on an independence move ... you can \u00b4 t go against the will of the people can \u00b4 t you ? 
  greece wanted to leave eu and join russian/euroasia union ... looks a perfectly reasonable position from tsipras ; in the same level of reasonability of a brexit for instance . 
  work is finally over ... behold the new dawn, 
  why would they want that , or anyone in their right mind ? 
  ... maybe they just want to project themselves as a powerful country , mainly for internal consummation . 
  i was not referring to the author opinion or opinions , which i only read the first lines . 
  extremists are a menace to everyone no matter where they are , especially if they have access to power, 
  this populist governments and political parties are a menace to europe . 
   i am however sorry for the working class leave voters and the elderly . 
  when british economy inevitably tanks they will be the first to be thrown overboard . 
  they where probably the support base for farage and friends in the referendum ... so ... it \u00b4 s kind a full circle, 
  this world is a very strange place ... [ what \u00b4 s a `` foreigner currency store '' ? 
  ] ( http://chrisniedenthal.com/en/works/pewex-1982 ), 
  why notes with more lifespan when a central bank can print all the money they want ? 
  why even print more paper/plastic notes when digital money is more traceable for taxation purposes ? 
  lol ... do you know any credible regulator ? 
  totally true ... and if this was only between very big corporations and big ones ... it actually is like this in every day life, 
  they are related . 
  governments are broken , they will go after money where they can and can \u00b4 t ; do you think volkswagen was the only one cheating on the emissions ? 
  ... it \u00b4 s a war !, 
  is russia habited ? 
  what an illusion ... there \u00b4 s no free markets , except in somalia and other 3rd world countries . 
  open the gates to hell of free trade . 
   but do n't expect the slap in the face of the idealists who believe in united europe would go unnoticed . 
  i \u00b4 m an idealist for believing in a united europe . 
  but what do you call brexit promoters or the greek way to solve is debt problem ( the tsipras and varoufakis way ) ... not realist that \u00b4 s for sure ; incompetent ? 
  you don \u00b4 t get it . 
  how would you define the basque identity ? 
  the world has changed a lot , especially since china joined the wto ; a lot of people didn \u00b4 t understood that fact , and are now stuck between a hard place and a rock . 
  there is in fact a european spirit and brexit is a betrayal on us ... we that identify with the european ideals . 
  at this point i think we , rest of the eu won \u00b4 t forgive uk for that betrayal . 
  they where probably the useful idiots in someone else play book, 
  uk lays between a rat lab and a joke, 
   suspicion of inciting racial hatred for throwing bacon ? 
  ... people are over rated, 
   how would you feel if people threw stuff into a church ?
