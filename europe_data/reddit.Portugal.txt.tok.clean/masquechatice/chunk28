  my comment was disrespectful to the uk as an all ; ukip members don \u00b4 t represent the all country , but the all country as to answer on the kind of people they bring to international organizations, 
  uk pushing eu to new levels ... again . 
  it \u00b4 s starting to happen already ... looks like a prophecy to me . 
  the us continuous imperial expansion is going to send us all down the drain ... 
  it \u00b4 s part of the economic war ...

  people can go for a bank run whenever and in quantity they want ... the bank will only deliver the money they want . 
  is as if greeks are greeks worst enemies !,

  i like what you did there ... nice, 
   i found out the other day that my wife 's uncle voted for brexit because his son is training to be a doctor , and does n't like jeremy hunt , who campaigned for remain . 
  hummm ... ok ...  `` here i am , ishmael , '' he told me recently , in his office at the european parliament in strasbourg , invoking the old testament as he gestured around him . 
  `` every man 's hand is against me . '' ... looks mental disturbing ... 
  so leave ... 
  farage could be the dictator ... there \u00b4 s potential in there !, 
   the first thing the italian dude did , when he got money was to buy a horse as a gift , like he won the lottery . 
  this mentality is not very encouraging . 
  i don \u00b4 t necessarily agree with you , because i don \u00b4 t know the all story here , but in the story i \u00b4 ve eared in the video , the guy uses the pony in festivities to take a ride with the little kids ; well , maybe he gets payed for this service , so is putting the investment to rent, 
  ok , but this is a start ... the principles are there ... and to start a fire , you only need a spark in the right spot . 
  this is bad news for the incompetent populist ... 
  i get this i get this ... `` asian skeleton found in romanian place , on a polish neighbourhood , in britain '', 
  looks like a 4 year old letter, 
  `` failed to declare '' ... because we all know how this things work . 
  looks like he is the populist of the place, 
  rich cultures ... people had time to spend on those things ; dresses , cuisine , traditions ... 
  the fence is to keep people out or to keep people in ? 
  is not about getting there , is how you get there . 
  they tell here in europe that gypsies eat children at breakfast ... and migrants have diseases and are cannibals ; europe is getting very nasty with all this bad people . 
  this only happens in third world countries . 
  first world countries are so developed that people think they vote in consciousness ...

  didn \u00b4 t get that reference or what do you mean . 
   i simply defended hungary 's right and obligation as a country to defend it 's borders and it 's interests as it perceives them it \u00b4 s women , children , old people and some younger ones , but unarmed ... it \u00b4 s not a fucking army , this people want shelter and some food to keep going their journey . 
   i as a citizen of serbia , a european fucking country ( i checked it on a map ) , had to pay 100 euros and wait in lines bad things happened in your country not so long ago ; really bad stuff . 
  probably precautions measures . 
   who is selling the weapons to terrorists ? 
  well let me elucidate you on this one [ 27-7-2016 ] ( https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewi0xpyrlozpahxfvrokhd6ca-iqfggemaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.theguardian.com%2fworld%2f2016%2fjul%2f27%2fweapons-flowing-eastern-europe-middle-east-revealed-arms-trade-syria&amp;usg=afqjcnglkz3sajtbpyqpcjuyq03ahnq42a&amp;sig2=qclooet1p6p23lk8yy-plq&amp;bvm=bv.132479545,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja )  but lets talk about consequences and shame countries that defend their borders and interests dictated by the constitutions of said countries . 
  all what was asked from a decent country was to receive , register and process those refugees in a human way , for good sake . 
  is that so difficult to accomplish that you need to stop those people at a barrel of a gun ? 
  we can be poor , no one wants to came here because no money and no jobs , but we still have mothers to teach us something . 
  thanks . 
  i try hard to be called douchebag by someone who defends treating people like shit , just because they are refugees or whatever ... 
  so hungary is run by scumbag people , that threat other people like shit , razing barber wire fences to stop people getting in their shitty countries . 
  this refugees don \u00b4 t want to stay in shitty hungary , because who on his right mind want to stay there . 
  at the same time hungary and other eastern countries sell weapons to isis that help foment the wars that bring refugees to hungary doorstep . 
  luxembourg on the other hand is a rich country , with high standard of living . 
  this tiny country gets his money to feed his people from money laundry and tax evasion from around the world . 
  i \u00b4 m confused ... which is lower by the scumbags standards ? 
  judging by your comment you don \u00b4 t even know what values are , how can you talk about them ? 
  i agree with the idea that hungary has a shameful behaviour towards refugees , press independence ... apparently they are now selling weapons to isis and building fences to stop refugees that ran from wars created by isis , but let \u00b4 s check luxembourg toward tax evasion !, 
  where does luxembourg gets it \u00b4 s money to keep his standard of living ? 
  it \u00b4 s all the same shit with different names . 
  could not agree with you more . 
  i just hope you where \u00b4 t referring to me as the guy who owns the idea and not the reasoning that lead to that idea . 
  there are ways to mitigate the pain ; in the limit you can always choose to shut down the machines . 
  that idea to die or live in constant pain i believe is not a correct one . 
  there \u00b4 s a big difference between shutting down a machine that keeps someone alive , and to use euthanasia in a decision made by someone consciousness before the big troubles caused by a disease . 
  i don \u00b4 t agree with you . 
  i \u00b4 m not judging , i \u00b4 m question their options ; i \u00b4 m entitled to one opinion and i \u00b4 m free to communicate that opinion to the world . 
   you can not deny another person the choice because you can not fathom her reasons . 
  by this level of thinking , anything is possible ; i have an hot discussion with someone and by accident or not i kill the other person ... was self defense , who are you to judge me ? 
  if she wants to die , let her die ; in some parts of the world they still use a bullet in the head ; like i said , it \u00b4 s all fucked up ; people are capable of the best and of the worst ... this is not the best of mankind face , that \u00b4 s for sure . 
  why suffer ? 
  ... like suffering wasn \u00b4 t part of life ; let \u00b4 s erase the bad memories from our minds and only keep the good ones . 
  like in between the euthanasia and natural dead she couldn \u00b4 t have good moments !, 
  ... what a disgrace of society ... 
  how to put this into perspective , without insulting anyone ? 
  wtf, 
  let \u00b4 s face it . 
  the system is broken ; the only way out of this is fragmentation , with small regions or communities gaining more independence . 
  states are broken . 
  yes u can, 
  glad to hear that ... thanks, 
  looks like a nice step towards integration ... separate to segregate . 
  what can go wrong ? 
  [ first imgaes ] ( https://youtu.be/qiqm86ee5q8 ), 
  i \u00b4 ve mixed feelings ... part of me wants to cry and the other part wants to laugh ... but i guess i \u00b4 m not the only joke , that makes my misfortune more bearable, 
  3.8 in greece seems very low ; also 8,2 in portugal seems absurd high ; looks crappy stats to me, 
  how do you suicide .2 ? 
  ... shoot both legs ? 
  the lack of respect for their fellow man , in a time of need , in a position of despair ... more of a psychopath,
