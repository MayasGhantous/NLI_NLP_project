  ** edit : ** someone need to reevaluate the wealth metrics, 
  i see buddhist setting themselves on fire but not blowing themselves up in crowded markets, 
  i have to say that , for me , islam only brought suffering to the world ... 
  i don \u00b4 t see radical christians or buddhist blowing themselves up ... 
  if this guys want me to hate islam , they are doing a good job . 
  if i understand what your saying ... they subsidize production ? 
  but ... that \u00b4 s only good for domestic consumption !, 
  ... the products they export have to be sell in this destinations with high prices, 
  wow ... how can switzerland , france , italy be any competitive with such high production costs ? 
  ... ** edit : ** wow ... they can \u00b4 t ... top 5 export destinations for this countries are in eu and us ... meaning they are fucked with the lowering imports from this destinations !, 
  [ link ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/profile/country/ita/ ), 
  why should an ignorant psychopath decide what i should do , believe , think ... fuck this people ... just nuke saudi arabia and all this shitty countries that support this crap, 
  this idiot was saying a few months ago that euro would collapse after the greek \u00b4 s bailout ... why does he have any credibility ? 
  we need people to arrange and deliver this food , and people to take care of all logistics in a centralized way ... like a brain of the operation and the legs and arms ... 
  russia is a big fake !, 
  did you take your pills today ? 
  it \u00b4 s just russia playing his game of ... `` let \u00b4 s put the west in suspense '', 
  now this psicopats with kalashnikovs are a threat to west countries ? 
  ... aren \u00b4 t you people getting paranoid ( playing the middle east countries game ) ? 
  france already lost the deal ... if the warships are delivered , france risks never seeing the money . 
  this people are pathetic ... they have to get support from some pathetic state to keep up all this propaganda shit . 
  russia mobster money is like any other money, 
  yes please ... maybe then we can have some justice working in this country , especially for the wealthy who can pay their way out of criminal responsibility, 
  i think is a sign that russian doesn \u00b4 t want a declared war ; this rebel leader is a russian citizen and considered a terrorist by kyev ... the new rebel leader is ukrainian, 
  apparently you \u00b4 r right ... gdp figures are normally adjusted to inflation, 
   `` the euro hasn \u00b4 t collapsed ... yet '' give me a break , we \u00b4 ve been there , the euro is on it \u00b4 s way to became an international monetary reference for commercial transactions . 
   '' ... leaving the eu , england can arrange new partnerships with , brazil , china ... and we estimate a gdp grow of 1.1 % a year , in this scenario '' with that anemic grow inflation will eat your wealth !, 
  ... people buy this shit ? 
  what ? 
  so when you say the gdp in 2006 has been 293939 trillions pounds , for instance . 
  i \u00b4 m i suppose to believe that this value is the same today ? 
  ... ** no ** it isn \u00b4 t ... it \u00b4 s less in pounds than the equivalent in euros . 
   `` the gdp grow in eu is less than in the us , australia ... and even england '' and the inflation ? 
  ... the inflation in eu has been lower , in the same period , when compared to the inflation in those countries !, 
  well he got facts to back his positions ... 
  religions brought to society among other things war and destruction ... it still does, 
  putin bought a war he can \u00b4 t win ... it \u00b4 s destined to lose, 
  sorry man but i feel offended by the treatment uk has given to an effort made by 27 countries representing millions of people to build a better future for europe . 
  it \u00b4 s insulting and illogical ... uk wants to be more isolated in a more globalized world . 
  and banks to finance the reconstruction, 
  not again this shit ... just fucking leave the eu . 
  europe has the power to pull switzerland plug ... switzerland exist because it serves the interests of many people in developed countries ... but with countries going bankrupted ... they will probably start to talk the small talk, 
  switzerland : `` when money talks the truth shuts up '' , or like the portuguese mafia says : `` quando o dinheiro fala a verdade cala '' ** edit : ** the same portuguese mafia that has the money in swiss bank accounts, 
  youth is the hope to shake the corrupted system ... 
  what happens if russian peace keepers start blowing up in ukraine ? 
  that bird insulted all mother russia ... 
  i wonder what father russia has to say about that !, 
  the problem with democracy is when the majority is wrong , and the minority has to pay for that . 
  isn \u00b4 t israel promoting this anti-jew segregation ? 
  ... maybe to bring more jews to israel and keep the ones already there , inside . 
   and all it took was a downed airplane . 
  it \u00b4 s disappointing that countries like germany need a downed airplane to realize the threat in putin \u00b4 s actions, 
  `` strangest economic recovery '' = cooked books, 
  let us sit and watch live , the extermination of the palestine people !, 
  ... maybe give them a hand to fight israel so this can be quicker, 
  i won \u00b4 t talk about ira because i don \u00b4 t know a lot of what happened there ; but in gaza hamas extremism is fueling a war they can \u00b4 t possible win , and palestinians are dyeing because of that ... hamas attitudes are killing palestinians ... it \u00b4 s clear that palestinians enemies are israel and hamas . 
  this people are real stupid ... it \u00b4 s insulting to think that hamas isn \u00b4 t responsible for what is happening in gaza ... they are for me the first responsible for the bloodshed , even before the jews ; the extremism in both sides is responsible for the war in gaza , and this people want to fuel more extremism ? 
  ... shitty people that \u00b4 s what they are . 
  old school ... they probably don \u00b4 t have nothing better for president ... the mafia is closed for new memberships . 
  this is politics that is being played with kremlin ... in the lack of a military invasion from russia , this people are sending the message that they will tell what they know about russian involvement in this conflict , trying to force a military invasion . 
  i \u00b4 m afraid there \u00b4 s a good chance of that to happen ... but i don \u00b4 t think russia will go to all ukraine ... it \u00b4 s to big . 
  probably will try to install a small buffer state in eastern ukraine . 
  that reminds me of one of capitalism problems , especially before 2008 crisis and in big companies ; it \u00b4 s a common place to ceo \u00b4 s and executive boards to make decisions that boost short/medium term profits at the expense of the company survival in the long run . 
  for now everybody is happy ... the ceo gets his bonus and the shareholders their money for the great results of the company ... in the long they will be out of business , but who cares the ceo probably won \u00b4 t be the same anyway, 
  good to see some humanity in the treatment that innocent people deserve, 
   also , what makes you say they 're drunkards ? 
  people with something in their heads don \u00b4 t do what they do , grabbing weapons a 4 day crash course on how to handle those guns and go to another country to fight nazis ... that and the images of their interviews with them being drunk, 
  that will be the end of russia as we know it, 
  well , that explains a lot ... 
  stock market is a colossal bubble thanks to the cheap money from the fed, 
  hamas is a disease that with the help of israel is slaughtering palestinian population, 
   this is a facile argument . 
  the jobs `` locals do n't want '' have traditionally been filled by the young and struggling . 
  wrong . 
  in portugal we have high unemployment and there are employers who ca n't find workers , especially in agriculture ; it \u00b4 s true that this jobs are bad paid and people prefer to stay at home and receive unemployment pension , but this jobs are typically filled by immigrants , that are better workers , more trained in this kind of jobs , and often bring their families to portugal after some time here ; young people don \u00b4 t want this jobs , because they are bad paid and because is perceived as a 3rd class job by this youngsters , but still relevant to emigrant workers  but the contributions of unskilled , uneducated immigrants are negligible . 
  more than 20 % of switzerland population is made of immigrants ; skilled or non skilled you tell me that this is negligible ? 
   there 's no reason european populations need to keep growing . 
  right , so where are you going to charge your taxes to pay for the pension of the elderly ? 
  amen, 
  actually the immigrants workforce benefits the country that receives them ; in part they do the work that locals do n't want , contribute to the welfare state and contribute to the working population for coming generations having more kids in average than locals ; you need to have someone to pull those elderly in wheelchairs !, 
  eu should deploy troops in the crash area , hunt down the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice ... russia ? 
  fuck russia ... if the west doesn \u00b4 t want a militar confrontation with russia , so doesn \u00b4 t they . 
   the satellites are sensitive enough to sense hot spots in forest fires , according to the air force . 
  damm ... probably can detect the heat generated by sexual intercourse, 
  i don \u00b4 t know people are downvoting you ... you made a reasonable assumption ... people are real stupid . 
  clear flying a very common route in a war zone at a commercial altitude did not prevent the disaster ... 
  i wonder if the people in that plane where warned about the fly plan ... 
  i wouldn \u00b4 t get in that fly in the first place . 
  sounds to me that air carriers want to avoid costs , choosing the shortest route, 
  very interesting ... there are clear 2 moments in the artistic representation ; the first one is a choreographic of a lot of people representing manual and repetitive work in a coordinated form ; the second one probably represents a more educated kind of worker , probably engineers , appearing not in vast numbers but in small teams playing and chanting , not like the first ones ... and speaking some kind of mantra , that they repeat endlessly ... kind of mind control thing ... creepy stuff, 
  it \u00b4 s complicated !, 
   ~ ~ america ~ ~ russia , stop meddling and mind your own business . 
  the world already hates you . 
   should n't you be looking for madeleine mccann ? 
  naahh ... british metropolitan police is already in the field solving the case ; apparently bush cleaning companies in algarve aren \u00b4 t very happy with it , they are facing the unfair competition of the british police with all their tax payer money ... but i think they are doing a good job cleaning derelict land  do n't worry about where russian money is going . 
  is not that i lose my sleep because of it , but yeahh, 
  look on the bright side ... this will make a lot of people rich , on bribes alone , so they could send their new stolen money to london , and the british can brag about how good they are dodging the crisis, 
  what \u00b4 s the point of learning french anyway ? 
  ** edit : ** unless your a darkskin or roma emigrant and want to tell people to stop beating you in the head ... ** edit2 : ** downvote brigade , downvote this . | . 
  up your asses,
