   the strongest economy on earth take that eu saboteurs ... 
  1-why in the world of globalization , the uk want \u00b4 s to be isolated ? 
  2-what if the uk breaks apart after the yes in the referendum ? 
  thanks, 
  it \u00b4 s like a death sentence ... to a country ; `` there \u00b4 s no pulse ... it \u00b4 s dead '', 
   the eu just fundamentally doesnt make sense . 
  the eu makes a fundamental sense ; we as individual countries can not live separated from the rest of europe ... history proves that , sometimes in a very destructive way ; we \u00b4 re doomed to get along , no matter what . 
  [ look again ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/12/norways-pm-not-sure-uk-should-copy-its-approach-to-eu.html ), 
  i believe the part of germany benefiting from the euro it \u00b4 s true ... but comparing what we have now , to the fourth reich ... that \u00b4 s intellectual dishonesty . 
  what \u00b4 s the economic logic of leaving the eu ? 
  i got bored and turned off the speech , but all i saw in his words was a power problem imposed by eu in his pseudo democracy ideal . 
  uhhhh ... the bogeyman is out there to get you ... be afraid , be very afraid ... 
  brexit : `` the forefront of populism in europe '' , or `` how to shoot yourself on the foot , when the economy goes down the drain '' ** edit ** : for any doubts , ask syriza supporters how to endure the pain from the trauma . 
   ... continental europe, 
  or : `` how the people was desperate enough to vote for him '', 
  several explanations , but for me resumes in ; - external powers ( regional and world ones ) see eu as a power house and don \u00b4 t like to be threaten in their world hegemony ; so they try to break the union apart . 
  - people in general don \u00b4 t understand very much of economics , so they tend to follow the opinion leaders they sympathize most ; if this opinion leaders defend the eu disunion they go for it , like blind fools . 
  probably the best president portugal ever had , at least in democracy ( last 40years ), 
  and if the attack was against two heterosexual men ? 
  ... this trend would also make sense ? 
  reality will came back to bite them in the asses ... 
  brexit supporters, 
  nothing good comes out of right wing nationalists , nothing . 
  not great , but compared to the rest of the world ? 
  ... good, 
  is going to be a tough ride , because is in both parties interest ; the eu will make an example on the uk , and the uk will have a scapegoat on the eu for the bad economy, 
  here in portugal we have a popular saying : `` com doces e bolos se enganam os tolos '' , something that translates to `` with candies and cakes we get to fool the fools '' .

  this `` democracy '' thing is getting out of control !, 
  sangria ** not ** wine, 
   the european negotiating team , in practice led by germany , argue that the problem is not the size of greece 's debts but the country 's slow growth and failure to reform . 
  they point to the experience of spain , which has carried through massive economic reforms and is now growing strongly , with 3.2 per cent growth last year . 
  brexit is a farce . 
  yeah ... 
  i google it ; was the best picture i found . 
  people are smart enough to take care of them selfs ; we have institutions that have duties to keep societies working , making governments a waste of money and a waste of other things as well ... 
  that \u00b4 s some confusion notions right there . 
  expenditure isn \u00b4 t necessarily debt . 
  this has nothing to do with gdp . 
  deficit is when you have more expenditure than revenue . 
  surplus is when you have more revenue than expenditure , so why are you talking about gdp ? 
  why we have governments ?

  the us works ? 
   grexit is a solution don \u00b4 t agree with that . 
   devaluing the euro is a solution ok , and for what ? 
  for exports ? 
  and whose buying ? 
  ... do we still have any industry ? 
  ... besides the german one . 
   debt that is channeled towards high pay-off infrastructure investment is a solution , enterprise support is a solution . 
  sorry i don \u00b4 t see a solution here ;, 
  austerity is a short fix to stabilize the economy , is not a grow strategy for a never ending economic grow and prosperity that we all ear when we were kids . 
  yeah , and how much of it reaches the people and the real economy ? 
  ... not an expert on this , but it looks to me that intermediaries like banks are using this money to cover up the holes in their accounts ; if this is true maybe we \u00b4 re seeing the inflation of a new bubble . 
  you \u00b4 r a theoretical , but in all that manbo jambo i agree in ~ ~ one ~ ~ two thing : big corp. fucked us all big time and creditors where not interest in debt repayment ; the rest you said is just political party propaganda , with no bases in reality . 
  do you want me answer that ? 
  you don \u00b4 t know what you say about austerity . 
  austerity is bad ? 
  agree . 
  alternative ? 
  print more money = inflation = get fucked anyway . 
  why ? 
  because there \u00b4 s no demand for more economy ; someone called this a depression for some reason . 
  solutions ? 
  no one knows , probably because there ain \u00b4 t one . 
  nato won \u00b4 t think twice ; it will go for a direct confrontation ... it \u00b4 s a war machine all gear up waiting for the go sign ; it will make europe the battle ground not the us, 
  i see your point , it \u00b4 s a damm good one ; but russia or nato can not initiate any major invasion with limited nuclear or non nuclear bomb but highly lethal strikes , they would have to put all cards in the table . 
  for instance , you can grab parts of ukraine or any peripheral countries with this strategy , but to go far away than donesk , you would have to denounce your conquering strategy ... russia troops in kiev are an in facto invasion , no turning around ; the conflict would escalate quickly . 
  you \u00b4 re right , but the nuclear armageddon is a good deterrent to any flaw \u00b4 s strategy exploitation , it \u00b4 s a game changer ; there \u00b4 s a reason why superpowers changed the conflicts to proxy wars . 
  do you realize the consequences of a full scale war in the west ? 
  this is not 1939 all over again ... 
   if it were n't for nato there \u00b4 s a reason for nato \u00b4 s invention . 
  what if the sky wasn \u00b4 t blue ... what if there was no poverty in the world ... what if ...
