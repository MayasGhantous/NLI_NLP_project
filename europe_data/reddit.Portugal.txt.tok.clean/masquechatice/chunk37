  even if i don \u00b4 t want to post about it it \u00b4 s hard to avoid . 
   the left has become so preoccupied with civil rights that it seems to have forgotten about social rights , you \u00b4 re totally right . 
  the problem i see with the left being again the left of the working class is the conflict it raises between the working class itself . 
  for instance ; i finish my school and i want to work . 
  i don \u00b4 t get a job because : 1 - economy is a mess , and 2 - there \u00b4 re other people taking jobs that i could easily do . 
  in order for the left to defend my interest it has to go against the interests of the working class that already has a job ; ** conclusion ** : left has to focus on civil right that touch everyone in order to avoid divisions in it self . 
  this guy still thinks of left and right ? 
  ... should n \u00b4 t he be thinking of liberals ( free movements of people and capital ) and conservatives ? 
  ... because i can \u00b4 t distinguish between left and right any more and for a good reason, 
  i want that to ... 
  he \u00b4 s right you know ; i \u00b4 m also tired of people and society telling me how to behave and how to run my life , how much should i get at the end of the month in order to be a good farther or a good husband ... i \u00b4 m tired of this sick perverted society , where the most evil person in the room wins ; i \u00b4 m tired of this poor and sick country . 
  i \u00b4 m going to emigrate to russia and drink vodka until i die . 
  who \u00b4 s with me ? 
  americans don \u00b4 t understand eu ; that \u00b4 s why almost all the current american \u00b4 s intellectuals fail their predictions about eu \u00b4 s future , and listening to them speaking , you quickly understand why they fail miserably, 
  that means that the west has to close eyes on crimea, 
   ukraine no way . 
  ukraine is to important to russia to let it go to the west . 
  crimea is a precedent that the west can \u00b4 t close eyes ... it says that boundaries are not to be respected . 
  at least that ... the uk is a big meme, 
  did anything positive came to the uk after the brexit ? 
  how can it be worst than the middle east ? 
  see the / u/dnarg answer ; i agree with him . 
  slave is a strong word here . 
  `` voluntary '' if you need the money how can it be voluntary ? 
   low-paid job is not slavery . 
  it is . 
  and not only low paid jobs are slavery . 
  fake news, 
  if you say so ... must be true, 
  you can even feel the heat radiating from rocks ... floor , anything that has mass ** edit ** : it gets more hotter during the day than what it \u00b4 s marked in the map . 
  i bet is everyone fault , except the greeks ... 
  eu is not dysfunctional . 
  uk is dysfunctional . 
  visegrad group is dysfunctional . 
  if you \u00b4 re going to start the visegrad union because of opening of the sanctions procedure , you starting the visegrad union to coordinate efforts to stop the sanctions procedure ... like when bullies , bully someone and get together not to suffer the consequences of their actions . 
  so scared of you little bullying groups, 
  yes . 
  good . 
  hope they get exemplar punishment . 
  human values are not for sale . 
  and do they wear white socks with sandals ? 
   nigel farage warns over new referendum, 
  no , i don \u00b4 t mean `` the one that get most attention '' ; i mean `` the most internally divided country in politics '', 
  uk politics are the worst in europe ... by far ; brexit referendum , this elections and this possible new referendum are all ways to try to solve internal issues in the parties ... the consequences to the country overall have been disastrous . 
  don \u00b4 t worry , be calm ... uk will be unmanageable ... run ... 
  go ukip ... go farage ... 
  [ quick , taxi follow that car ... go , go , go ] ( https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/05/29/putin-visits-france-hopes-to-mend-strained-ties-with-west/macron-2.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x567.jpg ), 
  to be fair was the 80 \u00b4 s, 
  like all other \u00b4 s carmakers, 
  trump is a disgrace to america and to the world . 
  this sanders is a good guy that knows what is best for people . 
  and i thought that american voters couldn \u00b4 t go more down than bush jr. ... now they started to digg . 
  her desk is at a corner , like being ... cornered, 
   julian fa\u0142at , return from bear hunt did putin approved that ? 
  i feel rage ... heads should roll , literally, 
   say what you want , but terrorism has won . 
  unfortunately i tend to agree . 
  in spite of the usual `` terrorist will never change our way of life '' or `` terrorism will never win '' , the fact is this things kill a lot of people and change the life of a lot more ; not only that , it won \u00b4 t stop here , this is the new norm and the constant fear of dead will only grow with time, 
  wwiii already started , so ... better be ready than sorry . 
  thanks ... 
  it was a strange experience to watch, 
  makes sense ... 
  this ~ ~ erdogan ~ ~ brexit thing is getting out of control, 
  i have no words to express the horror of only reading the words on wikipedia ... 
  what are you referring to ? 
  maybe ; but it happened . 
  want to ignore it ? 
  now i get a little bit of that trauma in the baltics against the russians ... 
   as exports rose 0.4 percent and imports jumped 2.4 percent . 
  gut ; at least buy our stuff, 
  germany has constant trade surplus , since 1952 , and a lot of this export partners are eu countries [ link ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/balance-of-trade ) ... someone has to put this people in their place ; what are we , clowns ? 
  ... how is possible to maintain current status quo without massive transfer of wealth to poorest regions ? 
  judging by the article , it \u00b4 s man that advertise sex-for-rent deals ... if that \u00b4 s ok with you ... 
  elaborate ... 
  italy was one of my favourites ... good song don \u00b4 t get the votes they deserve . 
  one day i would like to know what drives some people to power ... absolute power, 
  fanks ? 
  the level of alienation from this comments is unbelievable ; you guys live in a bubble ... you can \u00b4 t even imagine what is like to escape death , even if you have to put your own life at stake ; if this weren \u00b4 t so dramatic you guys would be laughable, 
  do you realize that the trump thing and the brexit thing are not eu falling apart , more like signs of us and uk falling apart ? 
  keep dreaming, 
   but i think macron had the correct approach when he chose to debate with le pen and confront her ideas head-on . 
  he made clear the lack of ideas and policy of the fn by confronting her . 
  this tactic won \u00b4 t stop populists nevertheless ; they can use soundbytes , with no real down to earth politics , because they don \u00b4 t intend to rule ; populists from right to left , and we in portugal have the be and pcp , only objective is to build troops ... it \u00b4 s war , either against a foreign country or against is own people . 
   even though brussels and berlin were wrong again and again about the economics -- being wrong is all about you . 
  this is a problem ; macron is going to be a disaster in 4 years if he keeps saying that is a establishment guy . 
  it won \u00b4 t solve france problems , because it ca n't irritate the established interests and will face the anger of the people for being a puppet of the same establishment . 
  this elites like obama are morally bankrupt . 
  so ... now we have two turkey, 
   the crisis in greece the crisis in greece isn \u00b4 t and never was only about greece . 
  it \u00b4 s the all developed world that is at stake here ; we \u00b4 re all interconnected by this financial markets . 
   how can these smart people be so deluded that \u00b4 s what i think , when i think of yanis . 
  and i thought i had problems ... talking about marring your mother ... 
  a lot of strange things happen in uk this days ... 
  that nazi stuff went very well in recent past ... 
  that would be fun to watch ; one day more than 50 % concluding that the brexit was a mistake . 
  what would they do then ? 
  dig a hole and get underneath ? 
  this people have an agenda ... they are brought by foreign powers . 
  they say the euro has failed , but the return to the old currencies will collapse the economies , forcing this maniacs to became dictatorships in order to control the populace . 
  the virus is unstoppable ... we all know where this will end , like always did in the past ; macron just brought us time .
