  russians - if we ignore them hard enough ... will they go away ? 
  wow ... first the russian emigration to britain , now this warning , next russia has to invade parts of britain to protect russian interest ... britain your fu ***, 
  it was something i said , that letted you think i \u00b4 m a stupid heartless right wing loser ? 
  yeahh man , digg this ... you should go to the front line in this war ** with ** russia ... how cool is that ... 
  nato should declare war on russia ... or just wait that russia gets bangged from behind from china ... yeahh let china do the hard work, 
  apart from the serious of the matter , i can \u00b4 t separate this news and findings from russia \u00b4 s interests to divide the alliance ... 
  but , erhm , islam has a little bit of both ... 
  if i can \u00b4 t walk naked in public ... why should people be allowed to walk with a burka ? 
  ... just downgrade islam from religion to political movement and their done . 
   greeks can not repay their debts no matter how much austerity they exercise your \u00b4 re right , unless something changes in greek future , like finding oil they won \u00b4 t  even more : more they commit to austerity masohism , less then can repay and printing money will solve their problems like it din \u00b4 t solved for britain , us , japan ... still running on deficits  but to understand this , you must understand first , why household metaphor does not work for a country . 
  you obviously do not ( it has nothing to do with `` complexity '' ) . 
  google it . 
  google what ? 
  the household metaphor works for countries , especially countries who don \u00b4 t have their own currency ... 
  i won \u00b4 t google shit , it basics account notion ... you don \u00b4 t know what you say . 
  yeah ... that \u00b4 s because even with austerity measures they had deficit in their public accounts ... meaning the continued to spend more than what they could raise , by taxes for instance, 
   but i find it annoying that people who do not put any effort in understanding how currencies work are so fanatic in their beliefs about what policies should be chosen . 
  look let \u00b4 s get some things strait ... economy is busted as a science that never was ... it failed to predicted 2008 crisis and it failed to point a solution to get out of the aftershock of this crisis ... tell me one thing , can any economist explain how value is created ? 
  ... economy explain things by cycles , and we have economic bubble bursting all over . 
  sorry but we need new answers that only a new economic theoretical paradigm can provide , and ground political decisions in the old economic school won \u00b4 t reduce the risk of this political decisions  a country spending its own floating rate currency does n't have to worry about running out of money of course it hasn \u00b4 t ... but does greece or portugal have their own currency ? 
   your `` good sense '' might slightly misunderstand the basics of economics though . 
  countries are n't households and the `` common sense '' you try to apply is a gross oversimplification . 
  right . 
  you are the one who doesn \u00b4 t understand basic economics ... countries aren \u00b4 t households , but ignoring the fact that a country doesn \u00b4 t have money to pay his bills as a complex economic matter is stupid ... a country has responsibilities , to pay his employers for instance , and hasn \u00b4 t got the the money to do it is a busted country no matter what you say . 
  do me a favor don \u00b4 t insult my intellect telling me that countries are governed by different economic or accounting rules than a household ... they may be a lot more complex but you can escape the fact that there \u00b4 re 2 sides of an account if this kind of speech is good for brainless leftist ... you have to try harder for me, 
  i stopped reading when the author says that greece is a victim of psychological disturbed people in imf and brussels , failing to acknowledge the responsibility of greek elites and greek institutions in the current greek situation ... sorry but the article is ideological biased ; apart from the mistakes that could and probably have been committed by this internationals institutions , only weak countries and weak societies putted himself in the situation they are now ... including portugal ** edit ** : austerity was for me a good response to a debt problem , that economists failed to comprehend or even point a solution ; sorry but my good sense tells me that you don \u00b4 t solve a debt problem raising more debt ... for me austerity failed when the level of expenditure cuts is so high that is virtual impossible to any government to accomplish that , and part of this impossibility is made by a world that is stuck in a big economic and financial problem ... so part of this austerity failure is caused by commercial partners of this countries that just don \u00b4 t grow . 
  crazy stuff by crazy people, 
  for this idiot free money for all solves everybody \u00b4 s problems ... dickhead, 
  the ruling class in russia doesn \u00b4 t deserve the people it has to rule or their cultural heritage, 
  ahh soccer : 11 players vs 11 players , and in the end ... germany always win . 
  after leaving ue , the british island will gain propulsion jets that will propel them to the middle of the indic ocean where the sun always shine and where they can make more cool friends ... not this european snobs, 
  in your dreams , maybe ... in reality you guys are screwed and don \u00b4 t even know about it . 
  russia is a rogue state characterized by extreme levels of corruption , mafia state and society and generalized underdevelopment of this same society ... frankly your arguments defending russia are insulting, 
  lavrov !, 
  ... you can kiss my ass, 
   the eu is doomed to bankruptcy , and the uk ... uk has is debt out of control ... it has been raising since 2008 and last year was over 90 % of gdp , unlike the vast majority of eu countries , uk is bankrupted in a matter of years . 
  is just like defeating urss ... to defeat russia the west has to do ... nothing, 
   how do politicians then convince voters that economies do not work like a monthly household budget ? 
  they don \u00b4 t ? 
  ... where \u00b4 s the difference in eu countries where they have no ability to print money ? 
  bad choice ... to save the bank and everyone with interests in it ... bulgarian people will have to pay a high price ... probably cheaper to let it go bust an risk a bank run, 
  austerity failed ... especially because we assume that grow is a never ending story !, 
  soon ... 
  in a theater near you !, 
  and the name could be uslr ( united states of liberal republics ), 
  i like it ... but national identities should be preserved ... 
  agricultural production is highly subsidized in europe, 
  this guy is a pathetic paranoid / schizophrenic manipulator, 
  france revealing his true face , behind the democratic mask ... a little taste of the french revolution ... 
  so the `` great country that is free , independent , safe , prosperous and proud of its history and read to fight for its future and that of its children . '', 
  can \u00b4 t be all that in a eu , but can only be that alone in a `` savage globalisation '' ... makes perfect sense, 
  uk your are fu *** ... you bought a war you can \u00b4 t win ... congratulations, 
   you have a crazy stereotypical view of swedes if you think a truckers life is all happy and no pain i was trying to make a difference between a swedish truck driver and a bulgarian one ; if the swedish life is hard , imagine the bulgarian one  this is an economic loss for the swedish society which could be avoidable . 
  well it couldn \u00b4 t be avoidable , unless the globalization process can be inverted ... try to tell those millions and millions of chinese field workers who migrated to the city to work in factories to go to the field again ... they won \u00b4 t go, 
   if a bulgarian truck driver take over the job of the swedish truck driver the swedish truck driver suddenly has no income or has to compete with the wages the bulgarian truck driver gets , which is around half . 
  welcome to globalization ... life was probably ok for a swedish truck driver , but not so bright to the bulgarian one ... so things need to be rebalanced ... and very probably the swedish truck driver will never drive a truck again in his lifetime, 
  you said that people rushed waving the racist card ... and i say that probably is because that is racist in the first place . 
  the videos in your link can only be seen in sweden ... any alternative ? 
   easy to go with the racist card well ... first of all is racist , so ... 
  i think that the fact that there isn \u00b4 t a debate is because there isn \u00b4 t an alternative in the left ... left is so broken as his the right capitalism , and it can \u00b4 t present a credible alternative, 
   like europe is against all non-white not all europe , he made reference to extreme left parties victories in this elections, 
  i think the guy presented in an eloquent way the stupidity of the people who voted in extreme right wing parties in europe ... 
   does he really believe the reason why people vote for right winged parties is because they suddenly become nazis ? 
  i think the professor was clear in saying that people voted right wing parties because it was a vote of protest and they perceive immigrants has a threat to their way of life ( `` killing immigrants and getting out of eu will solve our problems '' ), 
  this has to be stopped not in italy or the mediterranean sea , but in lybia , tunisia ... 
  well ... europe should expose putin \u00b4 s cracks too ... 
  german people are very understanding of putin \u00b4 s actions ... 
  i guess they will accept this as normal business ... , 
  are there any conclusions on the eu investigations ? 
  they did ??? 
  i see a lot of them here in portugal everyday , and they seem they went nowhere, 
  yeah ... probably it \u00b4 s my problem ... 
  actually i have the average russian in a very low standard, 
  like i always believed ... ( and got down-voted here for expressing it ) ... france lost bargain power with the fn win ... is like a shot in your own foot ... suckers, 
  i think is inevitable a west armed confrontation with russia ... the big questions are ** how ** and ** when **, 
  there are book stores in russia ? 
  i thought people there only watch media channels !, 
   or would they just make up excuses nato wouldn \u00b4 t had any excuse not to go to war on russia if such a thing happened . 
  i agree that the west is doing nothing to russia despite putin \u00b4 s aggressions to his neighbors , but an aggression to a nato state is an aggression to all nato states ... nowhere to go then . 
  i only make prognostic at the end of the game ... sorry, 
   but social problems are often the consequence of the choices people make . 
  and often people are victim of circumstances outside of their control ... and can \u00b4 t get out alone ... dickhead, 
  someone forgot to remove the white background from those glasses ... 
  you anticipated yourself to me, 
  haven \u00b4 t seen the link , but this idea of measuring who contributed most to war effort is to me ... a total lack of respect for everyone involved and a nonsense exercise . 
  who cares what russia thinks ... screw them, 
  putin go home, 
  i \u00b4 m not turk , i don \u00b4 t live in germany and i don \u00b4 t feel appreciated, 
  thanks, 
  apparently your opinion isn \u00b4 t a valid one ... judging by the downvotes, 
  neither you ... or the french for that matter, 
  i like the style of the article, 
  low interest rates for too long isn \u00b4 t a good way to create economic bubbles ? 
   also it was southern europe that watered down the sanctions . 
  makes sense ... we have a lot of commercial ties with russia , like ... can \u00b4 t remember now, 
  dialogue to reach a peaceful solution is not by any means a less unwilling way to get europe interests accomplished ;, 
  this is vlad \u00b4 s tactic to the meetings , in the next days , with uk , france and germany ... to divide the west playing the friendly game , like `` we want dialogue and cooperation '' and `` we don \u00b4 t want any kind of war '' ... and then their actions tell a different story, 
   and cut a multi-billion dollar legal deal france isn \u00b4 t loosing the deal , i think is possible nato buy the ships instead of russia, 
  people go there to work , because uk is more well managed than portugal , and presents more working opportunities than portugal ... whether uk is in ue or not ; is a labour necessity . 
  so i don \u00b4 t see your point as anything to do with uk leaving ue or not,
