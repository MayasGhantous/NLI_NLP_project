  no one wants uk back !, 
  ... close the door on your way out ; thanks, 
  not yet ... but the russia \u00b4 s confrontation attitude can lead to a confrontation ... is not `` business as usual '' with russia anymore . 
   they 've always been the only western european country to have the balls to stand up to the us since the end of ww2 very poetic in a romance ... but i have to remind you that being against us nowadays is being pro-russia ... and this weaponry and training france is selling to russia can be used to invade other countries or in the limit being used against nato forces . 
  wtf ? 
  ... first le pen , now this ? 
  i think is necessary to declare war on france too ... dam, 
  time to start counting weapons ... this is going to get ugly, 
  aahhhh ... get real ... extreme left or extreme right are shit ... they don \u00b4 t solve problems ... they invent more problems they are the response of the status quo that sees his privileges eroding and don \u00b4 t want to change because don \u00b4 t want to lose privileges ; they are some kind of atomic bomb , to destroy everything and built it again , acording to the old status quo interests . 
  as anyone bother asking if eu wants britain to stay ? 
  ... thanks, 
  we can dream high can \u00b4 t we ? 
  hey man this is europe you \u00b4 re talking about ; did you expect we could work together to take care of our own business ? 
  ... come on get real ... we \u00b4 re responsible for 2 world wars and centuries of battles between ourselves ... the best we can function together is to elect eurovision \u00b4 s song contest winner . 
  and i tough that eu inability to grow and to produce wealth was responsible for an unsustainable social model destruction !!!, 
  ... after all was austerity !, 
  ... man !, 
  thanks america for saving europe \u00b4 s ass ... once again :(, 
  on portuguese taxpayers backs too ? 
  ... yes . 
  big corporations and individuals get their money and dirty money here , and avoid taxing to portuguese authorities in this places . 
  luxembourg , switzerland ... a laundering machine on dirty money ... and even get all xenophobic ... look we are so good managing our business , and we even get to get massive hordes of strange people to mess with our superior way of life ... f *** them, 
  this countries are living the good life on eu tax payers backs ... 
  this comes in line with other france experiment ... `` paying to people to pretend they are working '' ... 
  creepy ... the guy is filming even after the dyeing woman asking for help, 
  thanks for your answer ... i \u00b4 m being down-voted here and i don \u00b4 t really get why . 
  china is one example of overcrowded cities ... fog problems and people living in unthinkable conditions, 
  putin \u00b4 s friends all over again ... 
  i don \u00b4 t want to force my choice ... i \u00b4 m questioning people \u00b4 s choice ... it \u00b4 s a little bit different . 
  people \u00b4 s vote don \u00b4 t count anymore ? 
  dominate this . | . 
  now is the succession circus ... 
  i \u00b4 m against serfdom , but overcrowded cities are a problem ; life is great in a city if you have a good salary at the end of the month to pay a good life that only city can provide ... but if you fail to have a good salary life is miserable in a city ; in the country side people live with more dignity because the land can provide you food ... apart from all the other good things . 
  want them to go to school ? 
  pay them something at the end of the month and demand their children 's to go to school ... we had some results with this ... 
  eu importance in the world is over rated, 
  france negotiations capabilities is serious compromised with this results by the nf ... no one wants to be in the photograph with this guys, 
  your assuming that american bases don \u00b4 t go to ukraine border now ... i \u00b4 m not so sure of that, 
  people buy this shit ? 
  apparently this loser now needs the west to stop the `` chinification '' of mother russia [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/26m808/putins_shift_on_ukraine_result_of_his_visit_to/ ), 
  and the bad guys are the germans ? 
  ... people are real stupid, 
  yap ... and the king goes naked, 
  i totally agree ... china \u00b4 s regime has some tuff economic problems ahead ... and i wouldn \u00b4 t want to see that massive population angry ... 
  shouldn \u00b4 t : uk should : novarussia, 
  right ... the million euro question is ... how ? 
  damm ... central portugal rocks !!!, 
  no ... it \u00b4 s because the comment in that unrelated subject represents a campaign , in this case performed by robots , to manipulate public opinion in this case against emigration . 
  well , socialism ends when other \u00b4 s people money ends, 
  yes ... but the eu project it \u00b4 s bigger than any country alone . 
  far from being perfect it \u00b4 s the only way to european countries don \u00b4 t start to kill each others , like they did for more than 2000 years ... so eu is not an option if you don \u00b4 t want war ... eu it \u00b4 s the only option . 
  a lot of people in europe believe in this too ... 
  i think, 
  i think it \u00b4 s a protest vote ... people feel disappointed in their expectations on the economy and their life and want to shake the system . 
  i don \u00b4 t think that this parties will have enough power in eu parliament for big changes on eu ... maybe to pull off some circus stunts , but nothing like eu disintegration, 
  france ... you suck !, 
  now i \u00b4 m getting mad with the germans ... forcing my country to this austerity measures is one thing ... but this is way tooooo much, 
  euroskeptics : oops !, 
  this people are pathetic ... they are like kids playing grown up games, 
  nothing to worry ... 
  the sociopaths ( north and central europe ) are trying to take control of the asylum ( eu ) , and the piigs ( mainly south countries ) won \u00b4 t let them because that is bad for their business ( mafia kind of business ) ... in the end it will all be ok , because they have to live in the same house ( europe ) , and have nowhere to go ... either that or the sociopaths will try the suicide and we all be in wwiii, 
  ok i \u00b4 m listening ... 
  and what are your credentials for having one idea of what your talking about ? 
  ... what do you know about economics and monetary policies ? 
  there \u00b4 re reports of helicopter use by the pro-russian forces during this attacks on ukrainian army ... the kind of fighting helicopters you can buy in eastern ukrainian shops . 
  portugal : there isn \u00b4 t any talk about europe problems in this campaign . 
  it \u00b4 s all about next year pm elections and who brought us here and who supposedly pulled us out of the mess, 
  france is the next in line , after the declared bankruptcy of greece , ireland , portugal , spain and italy ... anemic grow , loss of competitiveness and most of all a political system totally committed to the status quo and unable to perform structural changes . 
  yeah pretty much is a fucked up economy and i don \u00b4 t need the rating agencies downgrade to tell me that, 
  i don \u00b4 t understand your answer . 
  after reading this comments i believe that people fail to realize what was the nazi regime and the atrocities it committed in this continent ... here \u00b4 s a reminder [ caution advise ] ( http://youtu.be/26ebr7fnswi ) ... there \u00b4 re limits to our freedom ... when we step in other \u00b4 s freedom . 
  in this case is respect for those who suffered at the hands of the nazi regime . 
  why would germany want a bloc with bankrupted france ? 
  i don \u00b4 t know who \u00b4 s more hateful ... jean-marie le pen and her party or the people who vote for them ... disgraceful people, 
  commarade : russia needs this deal like water to the mouth ... russian exports are almost all oil and gas ... if the west reduces his dependency on russian oil and gas exports , putin \u00b4 s ass his on the line . 
  russian \u00b4 s economy his weak and underdeveloped ... 
  i bet putin was china bitch just to get the deal ahead . 
  if that \u00b4 s true then putin \u00b4 s ass belongs to china and china ass belongs to us ... 
  if we bang hard china ass , china has to bang putin \u00b4 s ass, 
  face it putin ... your ass belongs to us, 
  is it true that china put his products in europe with 13 % customs tax , and europe places his products in china with 50 % customs tax ? 
  wow ... that was weird !, 
  there \u00b4 re rumors that even the pizza guy doesn \u00b4 t deliver pizzas at kremlin address anymore ... last time didn \u00b4 t receive his payment and was expelled from the propriety at gun shots . 
  portugal didn \u00b4 t help to save deutsche bank for this !, 
  ... stop now, 
  conclusion : no one gives a shit for what putin orders ... not even their own troops, 
  i was thinking more like [ this ] ( http://www.tabletmag.com/images/features/feature_823_story2.jpg ) ... but that \u00b4 s a good one too ... that \u00b4 s a sexy women by austrian standards, 
  wow ... an austrian men with beard ? 
  ... what \u00b4 s next an austrian women with mustache ? 
  people should realize that although this countries have high salaries they also have high living costs ... making normal life in this countries no different from life in the piigs ... in many aspects even worst . 
  the world hates americans ? 
  is like ... killing the postman for bringing bad news !, 
  i can hear putin creaking his teeth !, 
  the lousy portuguese workers , work official 42h/week ... by my personal experience in some small and big companies ... real working goes at most to 5h/week ... the rest of the time is spend doing everything except work . 
  your numbers mean nothing and are only good for political purposes ... people who know reality know they represent very little,

  europe doesn \u00b4 t dislike america . 
  the west must support separatist groups in russia ... 
  eurovision song contest is a circus ...
