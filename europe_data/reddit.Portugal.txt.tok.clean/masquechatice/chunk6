  a lot of people die everyday around the world . 
  putin already bought several of this ... 
  this is how a suicidal europe would look like, 
  europe just proves his irrelevance by not actively defending a country that is being torn apart in europe itself ... putin is playing his game and his using west willing to solve this by diplomacy to win what he wants to win in the grund  this conflict can only be solved with russia together . 
  russia doesn \u00b4 t want to solve this conflict , unless it gets it \u00b4 s buffer territory from ukraine . 
  leman brothers had aaa rating one day before filled bankruptcy, 
  the west supporting uprisings in russia is not a bad idea ... it shouldn \u00b4 t be a problem to find territories that want to succeed from mother russia, 
  i agree that nukes are only good to the negotiation table , anything more than that is suicide ... but you never know what a trapped putin can do !, 
   he must have a good backup plan for russia something tells me that his troops will start to move after the referendum blow up ... to the ukrainian side, 
  i don \u00b4 t know what could be worst to sweden or europe ... a military confrontation with russia or an nuclear disaster in one plant !, 
  they don \u00b4 t have to do their maths ... the incompetent people who vote for them can \u00b4 t do any math , so why should they ? 
  is this us military industry lobbying again to ue spend more money in weaponry ( so it buys more stuff to us ) ? 
   ukrainian army has to pull back is military to deescalate the situation ... 
  this is so pathetic ... it would be funny if it wasn \u00b4 t so dramatic ; this people is using the same arguments has the west , and even comparing maidan movement to separatist movements in east and south ukraine ... this people are an insult to my intellect . 
  maidan was a people movement against one government that didn \u00b4 t represent them ... this separatist movements are pro-russian thugs armed by russian government to destabilize this parts of ukraine in order to make a buffer zone against democratic and freedom movement in russian soil ... basically preventing russia corrupt regime to be accountable for their action and not getting their asses burn . 
  well ... now the west has a new enemy ... is called russia ... terrorism fight has to wait, 
  hahahahahaha ... 
  only putin believes that russia has nothing to do with eastern ukrainian uprisings, 
  that \u00b4 s because they were younger than now ... 
  wow ... next they will want an independent state in germany so they can make a referendum to join mother russia, 
  something tells me there \u00b4 re a lot of things you don \u00b4 t get ... 
  no one wants to join russia eurasia barrel of a gun `` sovereignty '', 
  crap ... my pathetic government is reticent in sanctions against the russian thugs [ shame ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/visuel/2014/04/28/sanctions-contre-la-russie-pourquoi-l-europe-est-divisee_4408376_4355770.html ), 
  it \u00b4 s a good vehicle for russian roads . 
  i agree with him in the point of the political problem in france is far left parties in that country aren \u00b4 t eurosceptics and anti euro ; this changes the votes of workers who don \u00b4 t see improve in their working conditions to radical right anti euro , and is this europe policies they see as the source for their problems . 
  in portugal we have the communist party and the be as extreme left parties who get the votes from uneducated workers and typical very educated workers associated with intellectual work ( not practical work ) , respectively, 
  turkey has nothing to do with european values, 
  russia doesn \u00b4 t stand a chance against nato , so doesn \u00b4 t make sense to putin buy this war, 
  so basically russian troops will start bombing and invading ukraine to defend russians from the genocide the ukrainian government is doing ... like they did in georgia ... this people are so full of crap . 
  this is happening in europe . 
  where the f *** is the ue ? 
  this are everything but normal citizens ... the level of defiance can only be crazy or paid for that, 
  if germany fails to defend his own interests and the union interests because the kremlin was able to intoxicate germany public opinion enabling germany to act or making it to act to late , i think germany has to answer for the damage this can cause , meaning if key people in germany society where bought , germany role in eu is at stake and the eu has to cope with that , so it can move forward, 
  the video is very clear on denouncing this as crimes against humanity, 
   `` a fine crony capitalist in his own right , putin has learnt how bribe friends and influence quislings , from british trading firms to the german foreign ministry . 
  this is why european sanctions on russia are thus far anemic and will likely stay that way whether or not russian tanks roll into kiev . '',

  shocking . 
  uk has to settle his debts to the past , put his ass on a trial and respond for his crimes, 
  only who \u00b4 s not in a good faith spirit doesn \u00b4 t admit russia is beyond the pro-russia militias . 
  this pro russian people are a disgrace to their own country, 
  before i thought russians where losers after i know russians are losers governed by a madman, 
  u. . . ss . . r . . i \u00b4 m back into the u. . ss ... r ... 
  europe should consider the costs associated with the conflict escalation in ukraine ... 
  it should put more pressure on russia, 
  the arguments presented in this video are pathetic ... for me this is clear a disinformation initiative backed up by russia, 
  what \u00b4 s wrong with this tank ? 
  `` it \u00b4 s time to grab some guns and start to kill some russians '' - l\u00falia timochencko, 
  this news date from 1.1.2014, 
  in case of invasion by russia , portugal will only send military help to finland in case finland can prove it can defend himself ( ** note : ** there \u00b4 s not a connection with financial help to portuguese economy ), 
  russia has been destabilizing ukraine for a lot of years ... even the corruption levels and criminal levels in ukraine all this years has russia hand to discrediting kiev government and win popular support in a overthrown, 
  it can \u00b4 t be only that . 
  south spain has a lot of tourist too and it appears to have a very low homicide rate . 
  yeahh !, 
  you guys are in but want to be out , and when someone says get out , you say ... well i don \u00b4 t know i got ta ask someone , maybe we want to be in after all ... dammm, 
  you \u00b4 re so full of bull shit, 
  only in exchange for the uk, 
  go portugal go, 
  basically they are anti-everything, 
  like i said putin is a loser, 
  [ luhansk ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-luhansk-standoff-police/25324437.html ) this is patethic ... nato should send special forces to storm this ceased buildings, 
   please stop projecting like russia is invading poor ukrainians and taking their home well it is ... first crimea anexation and now very likely the eastern part of ukraine will be invaded by `` donesk self defence militias '' that are stationed in ukrainian/russian border . 
  if you are going to wash russia dirty hands on this , you have to try harder and distort the facts even more to make some people believe in your arguments ... take a course on russian media technics . 
  nato should send help to arrest this pro russian thugs, 
  that is true but it misses some points ; 1 - the devaluation occurs when competition with similar products , and similar production methods push margins down in order to cash in profits , keep or expand my market base and stay in business ; 2 - i can differentiate my product from competing ones with new variations in order to cash in some premium ; 3 - this devaluation occurs over time , normally long periods of time , and is a direct result of competition and other external variables to my production process , not a result of my own production , and there \u00b4 re always measures i can implement in my own product or process to keep it `` afloat '' ... so this is a highly dynamic process not static ;, 
  thanks for your time and explanation . 
  i will not discuss communism because i \u00b4 ve never studied it ; what you said about soviet union and politicians makes sense to me . 
  i will have to agree on your explanation on the capitalist crisis , except on these points :  in effect raising the ratio of machines to human labourers in the organic composition of capital , which means that the cost of investment becomes ever greater while less and less human labour is needed , meaning that less surplus value can be extracted the idea of adding machines to the production process is because they raise productivity and because a lot of works can only be done with machines ; so this idea that you \u00b4 re advocating that the massive capital investment in machinery will cause the collapse of the system does n't make sense ; for example : i have a factory and in order to keep my profit margins or even raise them , i invest in new machinery ; the only reason i \u00b4 m investing is because i thinking that this investment will generate the return it needs to pay herself and give me my profit . 
  that \u00b4 s the only way i will get the massive amounts of money to buy the machines ... so this can \u00b4 t be the root cause of the collapse . 
  in my opinion the root cause of the capitalism crisis lies in the inability to create new machines and new production systems that sustain the current level of investment ; so my grow ceiling was hited not because the massive amounts of money to buy new machines that will never pay themselves over time , but because you don \u00b4 t have machine capable of supporting your profitability needs . 
  this puts the focus not in the capital problem but in the scientific problem , that was unable to create new machines and new process . 
   capitalism can only become more and more inadequate as time passes , except if massive amounts of capital are destroyed , say through war . 
  ( as in world war ii ) you don \u00b4 t need a war to destroy massive amounts of debt or money ( just invest him in the portuguese economy -- just joking :-) you can always default on your debt . 
   the problem of apparent poverty in a state of material overabundance is an incredibly stupid one , and will only become more jarring as time passes . 
  this is a psychological riddle to me ... you never had this development level in the world and people fell unhappy and are unable to find solutions to their anxieties . 
   the whole demagogy about the greedy rich and the poor only confuses the real issue . 
  is not a demagogy ... it really happens that way ; i can only get massive amounts of money , or be extraordinary productive if i appropriate myself from part or the totality of profit made by others . 
   this fetter on further development posed by the commodity form and a system in which production is the master of its human subjects ( be they capitalists or labourers ) and not the other way around that is the problem . 
  i totally agree . 
   it 's worth noting that the soviet union was never truly communist . 
  like the other communist attempts in other failed countries ... that only tells me that communism is not even practical ... it boils down to philosophic theory, 
  let me guess ... the response to the failed neo liberal capitalist bull shit model is ... communism ? 
  ... the same communism that led to the economic downfall of soviet union and all the other \u00b4 s pathetic countries who had the missed fortuned to adopted it ? 
  ... give me a break !, 
   a capitalist crisis is not some elusive theodicee , it can be explained in terms that are not superstructural , vague , or cultural . 
  and what \u00b4 s your explanation for that ? 
  us is insolvent , there \u00b4 s no way it will ever pay his massive debt ... 4 % grow in 2014 ? 
  ... ok that \u00b4 s good , but i wouldn \u00b4 t take a bbc or economist prediction very seriously ... like any other major news outlet everything was great before 2008 crisis . 
  you \u00b4 re pathetic . 
   and partly , it seems , out of frustration with the muddled way that the union went about saving itself . 
  yeah ... like the us is in a good economic situation to : `` ei guys look how we have done ... injected massive amounts of dollars in the economy and now we aren \u00b4 t bankrupted '', 
  it \u00b4 s a managing problem ... the worker only wants the money for him and his family , but southern countries like portugal are so poorly managed that this countries are almost always in economic trouble ; and i strongly believe that is not simple a corruption and bad politics problem ; the majority of firms in portugal are very poorly managed ... big or small . 
  those guys should be enlisted in the army ... they have a new enemy ... russia, 
  i don \u00b4 t think there \u00b4 s one in this country ; the electricity market is being liberalized ( for some years now ) and all current players in this market ( portuguese and spanish ) offer a mix of electricity sources ; if existed here a company that offered 100 % renewable energy i would give it a try, 
  my energy supplier tells me that more than 60 % of the energy i consume comes from renewable sources ... so only 24 % for portugal is a surprise, 
  despite i agree is time someone look at this , the article uses this idea to rethink austerity measures ... like the socialist using putin \u00b4 s fear to pass their agenda ; maybe the reaction to anti-euro parties rise in europe should be to close the gap between rich and poor caused by austerity measures, 
  thanks comrade reuhka for bringing the glorious times of the soviet union back to our minds and hearts . 
  our comrades took over europe to glory of our mighty leader ; we are now the most powerful force in the known universe and we will crush the enemies of our nation like ants, 
  wowdy comrades from our glorious nation, 
  i guess in the next presidential elections , that will be won by the right , we will see massive numbers of people on the streets praising the new leader that will solve france 's economic problems ... and then again maybe not !,
