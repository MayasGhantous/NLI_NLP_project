  i would try to guess a future title in this sub reddit : `` crimea : the failed promises '' ... in a so not distant future, 
  80 \u00b4 s is probably the more creative, 
  after being deprived of love the children are gone be physical deprived of their lousy parents ... the 90 % of them , who have lousy parents !, 
  great ... now greeks can start working to pay their debts . 
  that \u00b4 s the spirit, 
  some guy decided to put a poster speaking on behalf of roma citizens !, 
  ... that is so so so putin, 
   the left has basically abandonded the `` white '' working class . 
  in portugal we have the pcp ( comunist party ) to defend the `` white working class '' ... it \u00b4 s the 3 rd or 4th political force in this country, 
  thanks , i got ta it now . 
  this map is wrong ... portugal doesn \u00b4 t use russian energy !!, 
  i bet this neonazis like europe \u00b4 s neonazis are low skilled workers who see a threat in undifferentiated emigration ... like the rise of neonazi parties in europe is grounded on the votes of low skilled factory floor workers who see mass emigration as a threat to their low skilled work . 
  russian thugs = russian nationalists, 
  that \u00b4 s why i don \u00b4 t understand euro skeptics . 
  russia wants to buy a war with basically ... everyone, 
   told the press that kyiv and chi\u0219in\u0103u were a `` priority for vladimir putin who wants to rebuild the soviet union . 
  bad losers ... want a revenge, 
  nice flag !, 
  ... very similar to the russia \u00b4 s one ... hope crimea won \u00b4 t end up like [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/south-ossetia-crimea.html?_r=0 ), 
   our international partners have much to lose if they continue to pursue the current austerity policy ** new policy update : ** free money for all ... solves everybody problems ... or not ... anyways solves this guy problems ( more votes on him ), 
  because it \u00b4 s a loser, 
  i totally agree with the idea that this move by moscow is fear ... fear of a similar maidan revolution in moscow, 
  it \u00b4 s not persecuted ... it \u00b4 s putin \u00b4 s democracy your fascist, 
  there will alway be stupid people in the world, 
  comparing the ukrainian war preparation measures to the russian ones only tells your lack of integrity . 
  outrageous ... those pro russia thugs should be shot ... nothing important would be lost, 
  he \u00b4 s probably refereeing to russia neighboring syria 's ... 
  there are people in russia and other countries in the middle east that think that the arab spring and the proliferation of popular rises is a west scheme to overthrown regimes ... although some true in it is clear a schizophrenic reaction to popular democratic regimes in the doorstep of rogue states, 
  what do they have to loose ? 
  . . a lot ... refugees , humanitarian crisis , war escalation to neighbor countries , economic sanctions with impact in the west ... 
  it \u00b4 s going to happen ... russia is going for a full war with ukraine ... what will the west do ? 
  that old man , in the end : `` think with your head ... your head is for thinking and not just for carrying your brain ... '' sums all the pro russian side . 
  after the 2008 financial crisis , especial with the greek bankruptcy , this guy preached the certain disintegration of eu ... several years later nothing like that happened ; i rest my case on soros vs eu, 
  first crimea , then ... 
  the world !!!, 
  right ... but at least in the ** `` wall-street dominated , industrial-congressional-military complex controlled us '' ** you can express yourself ... is not a perfect system ... 
  sure ... but the ukrainian government wants to be a democratic with less corruption possible country ... russia smashes opponents that dare to speak against the corrupted status quo . 
  everything in russian democratic regime sweats legitimacy ... especially the corrupt/mafia oligarchs . 
  i like it, 
  invade military a part of the russian federation, 
  it \u00b4 s official a part of the russia now ... they even imported the same democratic regime as russia . 
  i see ... so greece is like a virgin in the hands of the gigolo ? 
  there are a lot of scheme variations , but it all boils to `` get the money that the government gives to pay part or the totality of medicaments or operations '' for instance : 1 medic passes false recipes to a fake patient that `` byes '' this medicaments in a pharmacy ... the pharmacy then collects the money from the state that represent the state subsidy to the medicaments ... there are cases where this medicaments are exported to under development countries where they get sold again . 
  1 operation that could be done in a state hospital for an amount gets done in a private hospital for a much bigger amount ; the state subsidize part of the operation to the totality that gets payed to the private hospital ... 
  greece lost part of his sovereignty , but it still chooses where to spend or where not to spend the money, 
  when brain cells start to appear in their little brains, 
  extreme left brainless people ... 
  when the state is responsible for what you eat or what you say , there \u00b4 s no free will of the people , so everything that \u00b4 s wrong in the world is government fault ... there \u00b4 s no i in communism , only we . 
  ** edit : ** the same goes for extreme right ... with few catches, 
  i admit some lobbying from us and german military industry , but assuming that greece is a sovereign state , greek government has to sign the purchase . 
   i guess pensions and healthcare do n't benefit the us and german military industry i tough greeks made the decisions in their own country ? 
   the biggest population and the biggest economic but can \u00b4 t match the rest of the eu combined ... so this is still a democratic eu and not an autocratic russia \u00b4 s putin style eu, 
  the man nailed it ; the europe \u00b4 s future is at the east not west ... with france like almost every other european country ( except germany ) bankrupt but `` still doesn \u00b4 t know it '' situation , the current eu relies heavily on germany decisions, 
  in portugal new mafias to steal the health care system are dismantled almost every week , with millions in lost to the public treasury avoided ... 
  so basically russia invaded crimea to prevent a civil war that never happened ... 
  lol ... me too, 
   naive it \u00b4 s a matter of prespectives ... 
  i personally think your an radical anti west who knows nothing about what is talking about ...  your wealth is determined by chance wake up  anyway watch oliver 's stone presentation of american politics i don \u00b4 t need to watch nothing ... capitalism won since the fall of the iron wall , so get real or get lost ... 
  whatever ... if brazil is to big for you to swallow don \u00b4 t ... and grow up ... sorry :(, 
  not all the decision ... some , mainly related to money . 
  the level of incompetency and corruption in portuguese society ( including politicians ) led the country to almost bankruptcy ; that \u00b4 s why there are more developed country than others ... 
   by that logic only wealthy countries have competent leaders . 
  simplifying ... yes ... that \u00b4 s why they are wealthier ... in reality is more complex than that and you can be a competent leader in a corrupt country who never gets to lead , because institutions there are all fuc ** up . 
  your right i \u00b4 m all pro usa . 
  russia doesn \u00b4 t have the economic and militar power to `` digest '' other parts of ukraine ... it \u00b4 s to big for them, 
   just like portugal is fake imitation territory of spain . 
  we don \u00b4 t even want to be a spain imitation ... we run with the spanish several times ... portugal is portugal and spain is spain ... 
  i don \u00b4 t understand why you get this idea, 
   also people living there speak a language ( tutejszy , \u0422\u0443\u0442\u044d\u0439\u0448\u044b\u044f , tutejsi - `` local '' in english ) that no one understand , just like portuguese . 
  hold you horses ... portuguese is the 5 th most spoken language in the world according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers ), 
   however what you are really asking is that ukraine let foreign powers decide its faith `` ukraine has been independent for only 23 years ; it had previously been under some kind of foreign rule since the 14th century . 
  not surprisingly , its leaders have not learned the art of compromise , even less of historical perspective . '', 
  well ... viktor yanukovych , yulia tymoshenko and the ukraine today are the example of failed politicians , that \u00b4 s why we arrived here . 
  i don \u00b4 t know about his past ... but it seems a very lucid view of the situation ... people change . 
  today is eu members meeting in brussels to decide matters on ukraine ... this russia reaction says something about the importance of the conclusions in brussels ... putin is open to a fair solution . 
  nice to see russia major exports are natural good , and major imports are manufactured goods ... which means they have poor industries and need the imports to maintain their \u00b4 s living standard . 
  the man is right ... eu should find a diplomatic solution to ukraine where east and west can be part of the same country without trying to dominate each other ... ukrainian politics don \u00b4 t have the expertise to do that ... that would be a major victory to eu . 
  economic and diplomatic sanctions to isolate even more russia ; europe and us should talk the same talk and put heavy economic cost to puttin \u00b4 s actions ; why i haven \u00b4 t eared of any eu official going to kiev to show support to the new authorities ? 
  ... economic support also, 
  ** conclusion ** : russia is ruled by lunatic people, 
  if i was ukrainian president i would bribe russian official to go back to barracks ... they are used to it, 
  [ this ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=uk&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pravda.com.ua%2fnews%2f2014%2f03%2f3%2f7017384%2f%3fattempt%3d1&amp;act=url ) one is very good, 
  probably true , but still is a situation that it can be solved isolating russia and with economic sanctions force a regime change in kremlin ... 
  you \u00b4 re dreaming ... were not in 5 years from now and ukraine annexation is not totally clear it will happen ; my opinion is that kremlin that has already annexed crimea will probably go for some more regions in ukraine ... not the all country , and then back off has it did in 2008, 
  well escalating the violence won \u00b4 t solve anything , would it ? 
  the ultimatum has been confirmated [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26424738#tweet1060896 ), 
  russia is going to pull the trigger with or without justification from ukraine ... we will probably see when the fights start to russia annexing other parts of ukraine, 
  because to do that they had to be clever than a monkey , which they clear aren \u00b4 t, 
  lost yanukovich and now lost touch with reality ... bad looser, 
  eu did some serious damage with that yanukovich \u00b4 s deal ; you are unde estimating ue diplomatic and economic power . 
  can russia loose is war with ukraine in the home front ? 
  let \u00b4 s kick some asses with a join military force ... yeeeaahhh ... use use use, 
  this idea of russia defending russian citizens in crimea is total crap ; defending them from who ? 
  are russian citizens being killed in crimea ? 
   i believe the general animosity against russians that stands from the cold war is partly to blame . 
  my opinion is that russia is portrayed in western media , and probably very true , as a rogue state ; corruption levels in russia are high and the lack of a democracy in russia makes them look very suspicious to western eyes . 
  clear this makes the russia as the bad guys and the west as the good guys . 
  let russia have crimea ... is like a leper attaching with spit falling parts of the body ;, 
   why are they bullies ? 
  they 're not bullying ukraine so putting troops on the ground in a foreign country is what ?
