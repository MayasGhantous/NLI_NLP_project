  ... they haven \u00b4 t done anything , but they are armed , an in normal conditions the army of the country invaded is supposed to respond and expel the foreign troops ... they have no right to be there if ukraine is a souverign country, 
  russia is clearly acting like bullies waiting for an ukrainian hostile reaction to pull the trigger, 
  the use of force by russia has nothing to do with russian \u00b4 s safety in crimea . 
  resuming : there \u00b4 re russians living in ukrainian soil , who want to form an independent state with the help of russia \u00b4 s army ? 
  ... a lot of thing don \u00b4 t make sense in this sentence . 
  fu ** switzerland, 
  leave them there ... cut the electricity and water supply and surround the building don \u00b4 t letting no one in or out ... eventually they will die by hunger, 
  great job, 
   but not necessarily a study killer from the scientific point of view the conclusions of this study are worthless , a good exercise but worthless ; 1-he assumes that every comment represents a valid opinion ( which doesn \u00b4 t ) ; 2-even he assumed that his base for the study is intoxicated by manipulated data , i think is nearly impossible to determinate the percentage of biased comments . 
  [ study killer ] ( http://translate.google.pt/translate?hl=pt-pt&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvisao.sapo.pt%2fascensao-e-queda-de-passos-versao-20%3df758352 ), 
  what \u00b4 s next ? 
  ... jobs for all your fellow compatriots ? 
  ... creepy stuff !, 
  this is the extreme right parties nightmare !, 
   hating entire countries and there people i don \u00b4 t hate russia or there people ... is a fact ; what does russia stands for ? 
  i sincerely don \u00b4 t see what , so this thing of west vs russia thing is nonsense to me ; is like a 2 division team trying to steal the premier champions league title ... it won \u00b4 t happen because they don \u00b4 t even play in the same league, 
  dostoi\u00e9vsky ... yes, 
  not much ... sputnik , communism , gagarin ( the first man on space ) , matrioska , faberg\u00e9 ( . . ) 2, 
  sorry to inform you , but although important , life is much more than beautiful untamed wilderness or fascinating culture , ... besides this is something they inherited , not something they made from their own collective work . 
   so that the mortgages that the execution of the foreclosure paid for do n't create massive losses for the banks . 
   what is astonishing in my opinion is the degree of organization of the protesters i agree , although i think that a lot of the groups in maidan where extreme right groups very well organized and para-military forces . 
  the differences here are astounding when compared to syria initial stage crisis, 
  stinks to corruption, 
  why should anyone want to be pro russian ? 
  ... apart from vodka what else is good about russia ? 
  in portugal the number of empty houses is probably bigger ; rent and sales market is being manipulated by the banks ; they own much of this empty houses and are not putting them in the market ... what happens is that houses renting and sales prices are basically the same for the last years ; with unemployment higher than ever and salaries shrinking , people have to pay the same for a house, 
  like i said is not a racist insult ... is just an insult, 
   could reforms not have happened in a less painful way ? 
  maybe , but that \u00b4 s the job of the government ... dose the austerity not to deepen the cliff between the richest and the poorest . 
   level of emigration from portugal , a generation of your brightest and best will have left for foreign shores and may never come back, 
   how is having the commerce money reference working out for portugal ? 
  fine thank you . 
  1 or 2 more generations and we get rid of incompetent people who almost left the country in an insolvent financial situation . 
  inflation is under control and the pathetic entrepreneurial are getting their asses burn to be more competitive and export more . 
  change comes with a lot of pain , although , especial to less protected people, 
   russian values that will be the mafia/gangster values . 
   to join a bad currency union maybe ... but the euro is slowing becoming the world commerce money reference ... so it can \u00b4 t be that bad , can it ? 
   that 's the idea behind a democracy . 
  governed by the people . 
  that \u00b4 s why the actual president was elected in democratic elections by the people of ukraine ; what you are saying is `` a country should be ruled by the people for the people on the streets '' ... elected official will be to afraid of riots and will do whatever the people on the streets want,

  fuc *** the demagogic left or right, 
   but if the average salary there is only 1/10 of the salary in switzerland that is a misconception ... altought the salary cliff you present is probably true ( don \u00b4 t know the exact numbers ) you are forgetting that the living cost is switzerland is probably 10 * higher, 
  fact of life : the north of every land always works more than the south of that land . 
   purely fantasist point of view don \u00b4 t agree with you ; i \u00b4 m referring to scientific achievements that boost productivity in approximate levels like industrialization did in the past, 
  portugal is a member state and contributor for cern [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cern ) ... so shut up and do your home work first before speaking so you won \u00b4 t get burned, 
  funny how the last decades saw a never seen investment in science , with so poor results that the pseudo-science called economics don \u00b4 t know what \u00b4 s happening to world economy or how to solve it , and even highly computerized works fail to obtain real boosts in productivity, 
  i don \u00b4 t know what \u00b4 s your problem , but apart from the fundamental work done by science to human development , the current economic situation around the world is in a great part the result of underachievement in practical scientific work for the economy ; i \u00b4 m talking about achievements to boost productivity in industrial , agricultural or in the services fields of economy ... so fu ** you and your `` inter-generational contract '' , because : 1 - i \u00b4 m not only thinking in myself ; 2 - i know my place in the world ; 3 - i know what i \u00b4 m talking about . 
  keep dreaming it won \u00b4 t happen in your life time , but expenses are there to pay every day !, 
  it would be nice to see something useful for the economy coming out of this science ... 
  well , that \u00b4 s probably exaggerated , the idea of `` stay with us or you will face the consequences '' but there \u00b4 s some true in it . 
  if you produce something in britain and try to sell it in eu , without britain being part of eu , britain products will have to be more expensive due to the taxes from border cross , loosing market for their eu competitor . 
  although they need very much the secrecy around the fortunes from mafias around the world that leave their money in their banks , you can ignore the fact that bankrupted governments around the world need to get a hold on those mafia moneys , so pressure will mont on switzerland government . 
   why do people think that not being part of the eu = no more trading . 
  i didn \u00b4 t said that , ... don \u00b4 t know where did you get that idea . 
  the idea itself makes no logic to me !, 
  more than 50 % of switzerland exports go to eu . 
  i think that switzerland was victim of his own success and forgot the importance of eu to their economy . 
   the jews and gypsies because they were and still are parasites it \u00b4 s all a matter of perspective ; i personally think is people like you that are the problem ... like a sub product of decadence ... economic , moral , intellectual ... 
  the idea i have in reports from people who visit the region is that portuguese culture is still very present in local traditions and people feel very proud for that heritage ... although i \u00b4 ve never visited the place myself, 
   and none of them mention any popular support for portuguese rule, 
   india liberating goa from the evil , oppressive portuguese europeans '' . 
  i believe that people from goa , dam\u00e3o e diu not only liked the portuguese presence but also fight side by side with the portugueses against the indian forces , in the brief time the fights lasted ; portuguese authorities refused to send more troops and equipment to the territory because where afraid of indian reaction to it ; i believe that even withdrew equipment months before the invasion . 
  british allies where no longer portuguese allies because they didn \u00b4 t need portuguese harbor \u00b4 s anymore ; portuguese forces in the territory where in small number and poorly equipped ; where ordered to resist at all cost , so that lisbon could buy some time to raise support in the region against the invasion . 
  the number of the soldiers killed in combat where different from the link you give from wikipedia ; only in dam\u00e3o the heroic resistence from the portuguese and natives left 26 pro-portuguese forces killed in action and an estimated ( never revealed ) 300 deaths from indian union . 
  portuguese incompetence in managing colonies in the world stage had his corollary with mario soares after portuguese revolution in 1974 signed a treaty with the indian union , making an illegal invasion in the light of all international treated , legal . 
  `` grapetooth '' ... is to vague ; are they calling us drunks for drinking wine ? 
  or just a good grape eaters ? 
  `` what might come as a surprise is that the number is not considered by the french government to be particularly high . '', 
  business as usual in nutsland, 
  oh my god ... we \u00b4 re all gone die !!!!, 
  the asylum is taking over this shit, 
  hahahahaha ... hahahahaha, 
  how can the most disgraceful country in eu be an example in anything ? 
  ... corrupt , liars is endemic in greek society , with a political elite that not only sunk the country with their politics but at the same time was totally unable to change the status quo ; here in this shitty country that is portugal , when our shitty political elite wants to state that we are in the good path as a nation , they just have to say `` we \u00b4 re not like greece ! . '', 
  in your face anti europe supporters ;, 
  i believe the correct form is ** lose ** ... 
  people have to realize that the currency monopoly by governments and banks led to current economic situation ; more than 1 kind of currency is central to economic recovery, 
   they are creating and unleashing a monster there \u00b4 s a reason why extreme right parties in europe haven \u00b4 t put forward and alternative plan to current politics ; in their case it would be dictatorship . 
  people are expressing their anger against current economic situation voting in extreme parties ... 
  but i doubt they continue to vote in this parties once all the cards are on the table , meaning what the rise of this political parties represents to democracy, 
  this are the same french that believed hollande was same kind of saviour , rescuing them from their own fate ... look now where they are and where they are heading ... 
  no news about this in portuguese media, 
  no those are the corrupt or just incompetent experts, 
  seems to me you don \u00b4 t understand monetary policy ... 
  i also don \u00b4 t , i \u00b4 m just saying what valid experts on the matter said . 
  yes i think that france , like us and uk and other major economies will default in the near future . 
  ** edit : ** not exactly by this order, 
  if s&p and other rating agencies reflected the actual state of the economy with no delay , france as other big economies in the world where well below their current rating, 
  brain wash tactics ... and it works , according to the amount of suckers in the room . 
  from greek stand point portugal is an economic super power , because we pay our bills ;, 
   it 's far better that greeks buy cars they can afford than that they borrow euros to buy things they can not afford . 
  if someone borrows money to a greek person , for that greek person to buy a german car ... there \u00b4 s a good chance that this someone deserves to loose his money . 
  if that someone is a portuguese bank i don \u00b4 t want my money on that bank , and if this bank goes bust , let him go bust and don \u00b4 t bail him out . 
  let the market function . 
  you have to excuse this people ... they are like kids when going to the supermarket with grownups ... 
  they want everything they see and like , because they don \u00b4 t have to pay for anything . 
  you have to understand that this people are actually suffering , and their suffering is mainly psychological ; anti-depressive pills , suicides and marital violence went sky rocket ... people are dying faster because of this . 
  their living standard when back several years , and probably will continue so , unemployment soar ; if you are used to a kind of living and one day you wake up , and have to abdicate , if not all , from a part of it ... that \u00b4 s massive suffering inflicted in people \u00b4 s life .
