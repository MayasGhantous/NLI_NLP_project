  in the end of the i think the crime didn \u00b4 t compensate and the bugler is actually paying for their lack of touch with reality . 
  i don \u00b4 t understand your point, 
  how do you define reality then ? 
   ( yes , i 'm from greece , by the way ) i bet you are also a philosopher apprentice , where reality is an abstract entity moulded to everyones twisted thoughts . 
  ** edit : ** ... or interests . 
  this is the end of the line for the economic grow for a lot of time ; even germany economy , the strongest economy in europe , is heavlly dependent on china exports ... the same china who is facing several economic bubles ... look all around ... france , us , uk , japan ... 
  like i said your mental paradigm is wrong, 
   the economy in germany is slowly growing . 
  0.7 % isn \u00b4 t growing ... hell not even 2 % ... portugal need 3 or 4 % grow for a lot of years just to pay his debt . 
   it is evident that we were doing something wrong all those years . 
  we aren \u00b4 t doing anything wrong all this years ... well somethings are ... but what is fundamentally wrong is your mental paradigm ; you assume that this all sadomasochist reforms are wrong because unemployment is high and economy is not growing , as a matter of fact the economy is shrinking ... well , my point is that the economy will not grow anytime soon , no matter what you do ... you assume that economy will endlessy grow ... well , it won \u00b4 t ; grow won \u00b4 t happen anytime soon , not in greece , not in germany , not in portugal , not in us ... guess what , you have to live with what you got , and for a lot of us . . ain \u00b4 t much . 
  there \u00b4 s a reason for that ... greece with his own currency has to import goods , like now . 
  what in yours everyday life is fully produced in greece ... probably almost nothing , except the agricultural goods ; do you imagine a greek buying a car in euros or dollars with their worthless money ? 
   he just goes along with the neoliberal game that is going on . 
  one thing i don \u00b4 t understand in the extreme left thinking is `` why all this sadomasochist reforms ? 
  '' ; so the all thing is a set up from the neoliberal to dismantle state wealth-fare ... but why ? 
  wouldn \u00b4 t it be good for every one if the status quo was maintained , like corruption , state subsidized citizens ... is like entering a restaurant with 11 million people and saying : `` eat what you want , the count is on me '' ... being me the state . 
  every body was happy ; the restaurant guy has full house , people lunch for free , and the guy who pays the bill gets the votes . 
  wouldn \u00b4 t it would be simpler to think like this ; `` there are no free lunchs '' , and someone , someday would have to pay the bill for all this good life ? 
  well , you still can count on us to fight the francius, 
  if the britons where good people , god wouldn \u00b4 t had putted them in an island . 
  ** edit : ** this is my today zen moment . 
   the younger mr gurlitt had kept the works in darkened rooms and sold the occasional painting when he needed money , `` let \u00b4 s see ... hum ... this one , i \u00b4 m going to sell this 400 000,00 $ painting to pay the electricity bill !, 
  ... and take a vacation ... and buy a new car or a new house ... whatever !, 
  got ta love the iii reich ! '',

   the level of schooling in portugal is the lowest of western europe expected years of education over lifetime ( source : [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00052&amp;plugin=1 ) ) geo \\ time 2009\u00a02010\u00a02011 ** eu ( 27 countries ) 17.1 17.5 17.5 ** spain 17.1 17.5 17.8 france 16.3 16.4 16.4 italy 17 17 16.9 luxembourg 14 14.1 15 austria 16.8 17.1 17.1 ** portugal 18.7 18.6 18.4 ** sidenote : i don \u00b4 t know yours education level or where did you get it , but seems to me it lacks a lot, 
  there \u00b4 s a lot of land to work in this country ; not enough money ? 
  ... do you think you are going to leave the country and get rich , working in switzerland , germany or france ; get real , you can win a lot more at the end of the month working in this countries than you can earn doing the same thing in portugal , but you want to eat meat once in a while , or get out with some friends you will never get rich in this countries like you will never get rich in portugal . 
  you can get some money for your retirement in this countries , if you probably work 70 hours a week , pay no rent and not going to the supermarket . 
  i don \u00b4 t know the figures for this affirmation ; although this is common ground on portuguese media . 
  from my personal experience i know a lot more people going out with no qualifications at all , meaning no college degree , than people leaving with higher education . 
  no way !!!!, 
  ... get out of here !!!!, 
  ... seriously ? 
  people insist in going to shit holes like pakistan ... shitty things happen ;, 
  i thought he was talking about portugal in some parts ; the status quo at his best ; good article . 
  roma again ? 
  ... why \u00b4 s so difficult for this people to understand : that \u00b4 s their way of life and , with some rare exceptions , they don \u00b4 t even want to integrate western way of life ; just leave them alone ; if they do something illegal , punish them , but stop this nosense of integrating like `` we \u00b4 re all the same '' ... we \u00b4 re not . 
  for instance if 30 % of norway gdp comes from selling oil , means that gdp per capita is inflated when compared to a country that only produces agricultural or industrial goods . 
  in the limit you can have a country that only sells oil and doesn \u00b4 t produce anything and have the highest gdp per capita . 
  well i guess the gdp index is crap . 
  didn \u00b4 t saw it coming ... 
  i always thought it was maiden \u00b4 s fault , seriously ... everyone was working at that time of the day !, 
  but wealth transfer is happening right now ; portuguese \u00b4 s large companies are going to the netherlands to fiscal home to escape heavier taxation . 
   you have no idea what you 're saying . 
  you \u00b4 re right i \u00b4 m not economist . 
  ** edit : **  if what you say would actually happen most of the eu countries would be bankrupt in 5-10 years from where i stand a lot of then will be bankrupt in 5-10 years or less with or without common fiscal policies ; with lower exports in world mega recession or without the ability to attract capital for a record of being a good place to invest a lot of european countries including the north ones will be in serious troubles with their public numbers . 
  so basically you are saying netherlands , sweden or finland are poor states because they also compete on lower tax rates on capital . 
  [ eurostat - see the `` implicit tax rate on capital subtopic '' ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ), 
  so if you have a virtual `` empty '' hi-tech , state of the art hospital , you are at the top of your game ? 
  ... nice prosperity metrics ... 
  i think the technical name is crap index, 
   but a common fiscal policy and a more integrated economy also means far more permanent transfers to poorer regions you could have common fiscal policies without money transfer to poorest regions ; like same level enterprise profit taxation or common capital profits taxation ... portugal is a poor country and i don \u00b4 t want rich countries to pay me nothing . 
  us number 2 in health ? 
  ... so why the fuss about obama care ? 
  i agree that he has a point . 
  if you don \u00b4 t have a common fiscal policy in euro member states , you get parasite and rogue states between their members ... tax heavens or more tax friendly states , in the bottom line to attract capital to mask their public countability, 
  altough the context of the message is important , i think this translation is what is intendent by you . 
  yeah right ... like french people are really that important !, 
  . . puff, 
  oops !, 
  nice work, 
   `` greece has not met its obligations good old same greece, 
  do nothing !, 
  ... that \u00b4 s why we live in a `` democracy '' ? 
  i still have one excuse for not caring about portugal ... 
  if they start to play football , them i have to pretend i care again . 
   unless they are european penguins . 
  portuguese get laid with everything that moves ... so not a misplaced idea !, 
   all slightly postive comments about right wing politics is there a positive side in right wing or left wing extremism ? 
  are you an right wing extremist ? 
  she \u00b4 s missing for sure , but probably dead and not kidnapped ; their parents where formally accused [ link1 ] ( http://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsf.pt%2fpaginainicial%2fvida%2finterior.aspx%3fcontent_id%3d879978%26page%3d1&amp;act=url ) [ link2 ] ( http://translate.google.pt/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tsf.pt%2fpaginainicial%2fvida%2finterior.aspx%3fcontent_id%3d915196&amp;act=url ) signs of blood in the trunk of maddie \u00b4 s parents car where sniffed by dogs but not enough quantity , in part because the trunk was cleaned the parents where accused of negligence too , and probably the kid was killed with an overdose of tranquilizer ; the parents where doctors and something was said that they used this technic to settle a reckless child . 
  one of gerry \u00b4 s friend ( the parent ) was the british pm back them , and it was said that a cover up campaign was on , to exculpate the parents, 
  because they are years away of getting the life standard you get in europe or the us . 
  i can produce in brazil almost at the same production prices of china ... get it ? 
  ... china won \u00b4 t sell a shit to brazil, 
  it \u00b4 s a theory exercise of predicting the future with a mental framework ; developed countries are going down , and underdeveloped countries are the next big hit !, 
  ... crap is what it is 3rd world countries can \u00b4 t go up much longer in a sustainable way , if developed countries are going down ; who \u00b4 s going to buy the chinese production ? 
  ... brazil ? 
  the islamic presence in turkey is the main problem i think ; not that muslims are a problem per si , but extremist are basically anti social creating problems all over the world ; so unless turkey government is able to refrain all kind of extremism in the country in a stable way , is like trying to admit in eu a constantly time bomb, 
  political and social mess and economic laggers . 
  it \u00b4 s questionable if the government can hold muslims extremist ; they have political and military problems with the kurds minority and cyprus, 
  political and social mess and economic laggers . 
  it \u00b4 s questionable if the government can hold muslims extremist ; they have political and military problems with the kurds minority and cyprus, 
  and all nordic procreate with their daughters in jailed in basements and produce political leaders that want to conquer the world by force, 
   maybe it 's because you have less immigrants ? 
  it \u00b4 s because portuguese have a vast history in dealing with other cultures . 
  portugal in his beginnings was conquered from the north to the muslims ; we still have old women 's using scarfs in rural areas as a result of muslims traditions . 
  ( although they are catholic ) [ image ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1374970_660024827348960_393632569_n.jpg ) in the discovering ages we had vast lands in our colonies all over the world , including africa countries , india , japan , south america , as a result not so of our limited small army , but of our ability to peacefully interact , learn and teach , with other cultures . 
  after the recent 1975 revolution that brought us the `` democracy '' , portugal received thousands of portuguese that lived in ex-colonies peacefully . 
  people that although in their majority where born in portugal , lived a great part of their lives in ex-colonies , with different ways of living that of our mainland . 
  we are a peaceful people because we have respect for other ways of living ; we like to learn ; we like diversity ... because that diversity is what we are in our deepest sense of community . 
   i do n't think anyone voted golden dawn for what they represent as a party so basically greeks got what they deserve ... in every aspect of it . 
  i think the majority of people in eu don \u00b4 t want turkey as an eu member ... 
  i surely don \u00b4 t. 
   oeiras is crazytown . 
  in oeiras people elected one candidate that had full support , including his name and image , from a convicted former president . 
  isaltino was sentenced 2 years in jail for fraud and fiscal evasion and this people would have voted in him again if he could run for mayor . 
  porto the second biggest city in the country was won by an independent ... with no party affiliation ... that will help to set the grounds for a political system change,
