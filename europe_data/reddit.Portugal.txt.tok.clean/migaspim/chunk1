no one really cares actually ... 
  they are just friends i guess, 
  o esplendor, 
  same thought ... 
  [ grandola vila morena ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlessdqgydi ) was the song that was broadcasted on the radio on the 25th of april of 1974 in order to alert the soldiers that the coup of the carnation 's revoltuion had begun ( marking the end of our dictatorship ) . 
  it 's more about freedom than about patriotism but pretty much every portuguese person knows the song and its lyrics . 
  thanks for your answer , and once again i do n't intend to be rude, 
  it could be biased, 
  source ? 
  i think i have been misinterpreted ... 
  the problem was not `` how they mourn '' ( people do the same in portugal ) , the problem was the amount of memorials/accidents, 
  not that often , i guess found [ this ] ( http://etsc.eu/wp-content/uploads/map_twitter-720x360.png ), 
  one of the best [ sagres ( tallest man on earth ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0qippbv1d0 ) i never forget when i hear a swedish song about portugal . 
  the netherlands by far !, 
  the bikes , the freedom , the people , the way everything is close to each other , and everything, 
  wow !, 
  i had no idea !, 
  that 's scary, 
  if they are the same fuckers i do n't see how the rest of bulgaria could be celebrating ... who puts them there then ? 
  it 's unbelievable !, 
  people have died for democracy and now they do this ... it 's just irresponsible . 
  i was n't aware of this regreting movement . 
  the rising right wing movement in germany is weaker than in many other countries , is n't it ? 
  like the netherlands , france , hungary , poland , greece , italy ... 
  it seems that many countries already have it ... 
  i wonder how can we make it the norm . 
  is there any way we can make our countries make this the norm ? 
  then it 's more or less similar to what i was thinking ... 
  i wish there was something like that over here . 
  we have had enough of it in the xxth century , i think, 
  then what you have is different from what i was saying . 
  it 's still a good idea , but that was not the point . 
  i was not talking about knowing how the government works ( like what is the executive power , the legislative power , how do the elections work etc ) . 
  i was really talking about learning what each party and each ideology thinks . 
  because what i think is that democracy is under threat because it is no longer a question of ideas but a question of marketing . 
  take the us for example : i believe many people were n't exactly aware of what voting trump meant because almost no one knew what his ideas concerning specific concerns and political strategies were . 
  in the us it is difficult because the president is the president , and getting to know the republicans guidelines is not the same as knowing trump . 
  but take the netherlands for instance . 
  what do you think about each dutch student having to attend to a presentation of vvd , pvda , sp , cda , pvv , d66 cu , gl , sgp , pvdd and 50plus spokerspersons ? 
  ps : i guess was not clear in my question , sorry, 
  nice ... can you tell me a bit more about what you talk about in those lessons and how is it teached ? 
  normal teachers ? 
  are n't they biased ? 
  i see . 
  anyway , teaching about politics would be difficult with common teachers . 
  i remember a philosophy lesson where we watched a movie about euthanasia and my teacher said `` you will see that , by the end , people are quite reasonable and more inteligent than what it seemed '' and i believe she should n't make these kind of statements , and she should let students discuss their own ideas . 
  so maybe the best option would be to have some sessions troughout the year and the schools would have to invite one spokesperson of each party to go there and he would have to present his party 's ideas and answer questions . 
  and of course , it would be compulsory for the schools and the students to do this . 
  not sure if i get it ... could you please clarify me ? 
  not here actually ... we got this front controled !, 
  thank you , i shall sleep well tonight, 
  i agree with you . 
  but i also think you can not steal too much time to the philosophy lessons ( has there are many other things that must be adressed in those lessons , besides politics ) . 
  and i think it would be a good idea to give economics classes to everyone but it may take to much time and resources , and politics seems much more important to me . 
  i am actually glad to know that !, 
  it would be nice if other countries made the same ... of course the baltics are more concerned about this stuff than many other countries , but still it would make sense to have it in other schools and even in all schools in each country . 
  well , i believe almost every studen in europe learns about the rise of comunist in the sovietic union , the rise of the nazis , the french revolution , the magna carta , the creation of cee and eu , etc but i was thinking about something more related to the present situation of each countries politics . 
  a space where each party had some time to show what they think and people would have to know it . 
  well done , croatia !, 
  so it 's impossible for wilders to get to the power , is n't it ? 
  you could have asked us too ... why are we always ignored ? 
  even in the bad things ? 
  oh god !, 
  i wish i could unsee it ... 
  no , it is not spain !, 
  i would say i have a portuguese identity . 
  even tough there are many differences between some regions , i would say we 're a very united and homogeneous nation ( compared to others ) . 
  besides this i would say i am , first of all , ** portuguese ** , then i have a ** portuguese-galician ** heritage , then an ** iberian ** identity , then ** mediterranean ** ( i tend to feel more conected to any european country over any other , but i believe this is a bit of an ilusion and , in reality , my culture might be more similar to a moroccan 's than to a , let 's say , finn 's culture - it 's just that we followed different paths because of different religious influences ) . 
  so , basically , my identity is portuguese or lusitanian . 
  ( i know nothing about this subject , this is just a common citizen 's perspective ), 
  this is also a problem in portugal , very hilly . 
  and i was wondering if in the future , when ( or if ) the cars business starts decaying , if governments will find strategies to overcome this problem . 
  would n't it be possible to build some kind of bicycle lifters in big hilly towns where you could put your bike and then just nicely ride it in a smooth `` no ups and downs '' lane over the cars ' level ? 
  it 's interesting to know that some elderly ride bikes because it 's difficult for them to walk . 
  because here , at least in the main cities ( lisbon and oporto ) , people who cycle are in a really goodshape . 
  in fact , lisbon is called the `` city of the seven hills '' and oporto is no better . 
  here there are very few cycle lanes as well ... 
  but the government is building a lot more . 
  the thing is that they 're all empty because people do n't cycle and they are made in a very dumb way : a bicycle lane goes on the right of the road and then suddenly ends and if you want to turn left you have to cross the cars ' lane and , guess what , they wo n't let you , the drivers will simply ignore you if you have a lane for you , even tough it is stupidly placed . 
  i think they just build these lanes so that repports portray our cities as more developed . 
  you have never been here , am i right ? 
  flags that do n't have anything to do with any other for the win !, 
  european , over anything else ( secially after going to brussels ... ) . 
  and the only country i can relate to ( besides mine , portugal ) is spain ... we do hate them , but a hermano is a hermano , nonetheless, 
  a lot, 
  [ this is nice ] ( http://thetruesize.com/ ) spoiler alert : you will be disapointed with the size of russia, 
  and it 's much warmer , and there are good beaches , and there 's the sea that does n't freeze . 
  i say it 's worth it ... 
  i would n't say it is about good manners tough . 
  i think we find it too much informal to be barefeet . 
  which is interesting , since for what i have heard and seen , we tend to be much more easygoing and informal in almost everyway . 
  shoes on ... actually , here it is kind of rude or at least weird if you have guests and you do n't have your shoes on, 
  from my point of view , things are very clear in my country . 
  but in order to answer this i have to make a quick ( or not so quick ) history explanation . 
  basically we have two major books/ideas/writers in portuguese literature : os lus\u00edadas ( by lu\u00eds vaz de cam\u00f5es , xvith century ) , and mensagem ( by fernando pessoa , xxth century ) . 
  they are as important for us ( portuguese speakers , and not only portuguese people ) as dante is important for the italians , goethe for the germans , shakespeare for the english , and cervantes for the spanish ( or at least that 's what i suppose ) . 
  ** 1 ** basically , when cam\u00f5es published os lus\u00edadas , the portuguese empire was starting to fall apart in the east ( 70 years after we had discovered the sea route to india ) and that was a big deal , because the east was our greatest achievement by that time : macau , inida , sri lanka , trades with japan etc but specially the sea was ours - people could n't simply sail the indian ocean , they would have to be allowed by the portuguese . 
  so yeah , that was what made us the best of the best at that time ( i remind you that brazil , even though it was discovered before that , only got to be really important in the xviiith century because of the gold that was found there ) . 
  and so cam\u00f5es wrote this epic poem : os lus\u00edada ( it 's a bit like odyssey or iliad ) where he tells the story of how vasco da gama got to india and along the way vasco da gama tells all the great history of portugal to an african king . 
  in this poem , cam\u00f5es makes vasco da gama a very special carachter like those in the greek epic poems of old : as if he was half human half god .
