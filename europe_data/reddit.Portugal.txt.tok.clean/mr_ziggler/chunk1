moonspell is probably the most recognizable one from portugal . 
  this is something that i 'm actually really curious about but the google searches i did offered no explanation . 
  how did suddenly portugal became a country that so many people are aware of ? 
  maybe im wrong but it really does n't feel like this was a thing 10 years ago . 
  is new hampshire going trough some crisis or something ? 
  that a huge jump in numbers . 
  iirc from my visit they always had someone next to them who would do all the talking . 
  portugal here :  where are you from and how are argentinians seen in your country ? 
  we do n't usually mention argentina that much , brazil tends to be the main focus of our attention in south america , sorry . 
   what 's the best place to visit on holidays ? 
  here , lisbon . 
  europe in general , italy . 
   what 's the best food on the continent ? 
  italian  where can you find the prettiest women in europe ? 
  sweden . 
  i would definitely watch that movie .

  i did !, 
  but i probably lost like 2kg in sweat . 
  measuring dongs and balls i assume . 
  so , new jobs are being created i guess . 
  i live in the 40 area and tomorrow i have to walk to work at 15h30 ... gon na be . 
  edit : good news , i made it !, 
  that 's an impressive list on the iberian peninsula , til . 
  to give some context . 
  the whole point of the eu seems to be , `` instead of fighting with each other like we have done for hundreds of years , how about we just work for a common goal ? '' . 
  then the uk decided `` nop , screw you guys ! '' . 
  it 's not difficult to see why people got pissed off about it . 
  from what msn news was saying ( yes , im using edge , im too lazy to download another browser ) two of the guys have most of the charges on them . 
  apparently one of them was arresting some dude that did n't do anything , shot a woman with two rubber bullets that was just watching then chased and shot another one in the nose . 
  in portuguese : http://www.msn.com/pt-pt/noticias/portugal/cova-da-moura-um-dos-pol%c3%adcias-%c3%a9-acusado-de-22-crimes/ar-bbefeqa?li=aal4orz&amp;ocid=spartanntp, 
  it only happened once , but yes i did get to keep it ( :, 
  i have literally seen two . 
  i was friends with the people from the supermarket across the street and they showed me one and one christmas my parents wanted to give me something nice/strange so they went to the bank and got one as a gift . 
  we actually talked about the minitel in school here in portugal , i was always so jealous about not having one . 
  nop , quite the opposite . 
  i know very few people that have ac at home ( most workplaces do have them ) . 
  i do !, 
  it was actually a little windy today so it was n't that bad . 
  i also got the gypsies one growing up in a rural area in portugal , it 's kinda messed up . 
  continente supermarkets had a knock-off version of it for a while , never tried the original but that one was pretty good . 
  isnt that annoying dude [ agir [ ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-l-c4kw_z0 ) still around ? 
  learn the language , eat the local food and that 's pretty much it . 
  showing up at local parties/festivities is a big plus . 
  as about foreigners that integrated successfully , the ukrainians seem to be the the most successful at least in my town . 
  it is kinda cute that my neighbours daughter who moved here when she was 8 not only lost all her accent , but she actually has an alentejo accent . 
  azores is a popular destination for whale and dolphin watching , here is a page with some [ info ] ( https://www.visitazores.com/en/experience-the-azores/whale ) about it . 
  that 's what i have and it is the only type of relationship i feel confortable with ( for me , you guys do what you got ta do ( : ) . 
  ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/63/5b/de/bitoque-com-ovo.jpg ), 
  in the last few years portugal became somewhat of a popular place to visit/move to . 
  im not sure exactely what prompted this change and made us more relevant but i am really impressed by it . 
  just fire drills, 
  literally the only reason i would use it ( im assuming tor counts ) would be to access torrente websites , which of course i do n't do because it would be ilegal . 
  ca n't speak for all latin countries but a general rule seems to be shoes on unless asked not to ( if it 's a family that requires shoes off they will tell you ) . 
  oh , i did n't know about tf1 . 
  that makes sense , thanks . 
  im familiar with these channels because of my work but there is something i was n't able to find out yet , why is n't there a france 1 ? 
  pretty much the same here . 
  the only people i know that use them nowadays are people that are trying to stop smoking . 
  holy crap that haircut . 
  me and my wife always refered to it as `` the dutch middle age woman who has given up on looking good '' ( sorry !, 
  there was a actually a bunch of comments on askreddit a few months ago , and that marilyn manson ribs thing is a urban legend everywhere !, 
  it 's one of the countries i 'm really curious about but i 'm not sure if i could handle the cold . 
  by participation : football , handball and volleyball . 
  by viewers : could n't find sources but football , roller hockey and handball seem to be the most popular . 
  for each continent , these are the countries i would feel more confortable moving into : north america : canada south america : brazil europe : france/germany africa : angola/mozambique asia : india oceania : new zeland, 
  we have pineapple , grape , passion fruit , lemon and orange , i only buy it if there is a promo for it . 
  there is a national brand called [ sumol ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/sumol ) that is more popular . 
  we have a ~ ~ weird ~ ~ situation here where the party that had the most votes is n't actually in charge . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.progressivepost.eu/portugal-historical-political-pact-left/ ) explains better then i would be able to what happened . 
  this one actually required some googleing to explain it . 
  according to the searches i made , sometimes we get [ * dust devils * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dust_devil ) but full blown tornadoes like we see in movies or the news are not a thing around here . 
  slippers in the winter , flip flops in the summer . 
  wow !, 
  how are you aware of h3 ? 
  in-n-out is the only one im curious about . 
  every christmas i end up watching home alone 1 and 2 so we also have that going . 
  during the rest of the year ( at least it used to be like this , have n't watched that much tv in a couple of years ) every weekend i would end up watching either armaggedon , independence day or men in black . 
  nice choice . 
  personally im going with [ am\u00eaijoas \u00e1 bulh\u00e3o pato ] ( http://c7.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b73149a08/17094374_cpkij.jpeg ) . 
  pride might be a too strong word . 
  i respect someone that dedicates himself to something so physically intensive and i assume mentally taxing . 
  i do n't think we have any special holiday/celebration for them ( might be wrong about this one ) . 
  i remember how in the 90 's my grandaparents loved it . 
  they were actually as interested in it as football if the national team played . 
  i never really cared for school tbh . 
  it 's not that i hated it or was badly treated , i was just saw it more as chore then something that was in any way to be enjoyed . 
  while there i did had my groups of friends but as soon as i finished secondary school i pretty much lost contact with everyone and met a new awesome group of people . 
  nowadays the only contact i have with people from secondary school is wishing them an happy birthday on facebook . 
  as for the learning , yeah i really dropped the ball on that one . 
  doing the bare minimum to just have a passing grade was a terrible , terrible mindset and my life would definetely be better if i had at least just tried a bit . 
  totally agree . 
  i was going add it and beach soccer and basketball but went with just those 3 to make it more succinct . 
  i think we only have aloe vera in shampoos and some yogurts as a general rule . 
  our traditional music is [ fado ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6at0lvngmq ) so i guess i would have to go with that ... 
  football is incredibly more popular then everything else , but like by an insane margin . 
  there are a few other that are somewhat relevant but on a completely diferente level , the 3 most popular are probably [ futsal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/futsal ) , [ roller hockey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roller_hockey_ ( quad ) and [ rugby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_union ) . 
  despite being really far away , either new zeland or australia . 
  this might depend from region to region , but as a general rule immigrants from former portuguese colonies , ukrainians and chineses tend to integrate well . 
  worst integrated , gypsies .
