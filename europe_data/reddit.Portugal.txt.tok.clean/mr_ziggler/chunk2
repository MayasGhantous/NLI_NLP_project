  nop . 
  and this one kinda feels like it needs to be seen in a move theater to get the full experience . 
  this one might be complicated . 
  i have never heard of any type of lebanese community here and my google searches did not help at all ( apart from some website to meet expats ) . 
  im assuming there are n't that many lebanese people around , maybe we might get some lebanese/brazilian descent people since brazil seems to be apparently a destination for a lot of lebanese and portugal is a destination for a lot of brazilian people . 
  not related to your question but i ended up searching what lebanese food is like and it looks amazing !, 
  this is definitely something i want to try . 
  people really liked obama . 
  when his second term ended i saw both right wing and left wing supporters making posts about how they respected him on facebook . 
  i want two , my wife one . 
  its still a discussion in progress . 
  teenage me would hate this answer but ps ( socialist party ) . 
  i used to support either be ( left wing bloc , far left ) or cdu ( coalition of the communist party and the green party ) but some of their ideas are now awful in my opinion ( leaving the eu , dropping out of nato , etc ) . 
  same for me . 
  my only exceptions are sometimes i buy a coke in the cinema or have a few beers if at home . 
  despite the crazy amount of drunk tourists in the summer , i would actually like to live in algarve . 
  probably the worst aspect of going out to a bar is the amount of reggaeton i end up listening , almost as bad as the hangovers next day . 
  and this is n't something new around here , i 've had to deal with this crap for 10 + years . 
  the game that i hear mentioned the most is probably monopoly . 
  recently i got interested in trying some new and bought munchkin , last night on earth and pandemic : reign of cthulhu , i think this might be one of `` my things '' now . 
  i grew up in a rural area so there were a lot of them around . 
  no fortune telling , mostly selling stuff with `` suspicious '' origins or knock offs . 
  most of them nowadays live in social housing , their relationship with the rest of the population is ... lets say complicated . 
  edit : just remembered , there were a few nomad familys that would camp just outsider of town and stay for about a week at a time . 
  im sorry if i sounded like a jerk , that was not my intention . 
  i always assumed that people in your situation would be refered as , for exemple , a french with portuguese ancestry . 
  the type of police chases that we associate with american tv does n't seem to be a thing here . 
  it 's not like we do n't have crime here , but that grand spectacle of dozens of police cars chasing a single criminal is really not a thing . 
  you might be aware of some tragedy that was n't solved or some criminal that is on the run but the news seems to centered around `` we dont know where he is '' or later , `` we found him '' . 
  obsession might be an overstatement , it just sounds kinda silly . 
  do you want to know who we consider portuguese ? 
  literally someone who was born and raised here . 
  that 's it . 
  someone smarter then me will probably have a way better cultural/economical insight into this so im going in the table tennis route . 
  china apparently really upped europe 's ( and the world apparently ) level on table tennis : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/sports/olympics/at-least-44-table-tennis-players-in-rio-are-chinese-born-six-play-for-china.html, 
  pretty much the same as in portugal . 
  the only thing i would add is some ultras do follow some nationalist/racist agenda . 
  [ map ] ( https://fogos.pt/ ) of active fires . 
  bulls and wild boars might be the the scariest thing while hiking . 
  and ticks , lets not forget those fuckers . 
  he was really in panic mode , i do n't even remember him doing any any noise , just scrambling to get away . 
  if he wasnt from such a big breed ( he was around 50kg at the time ) that might have had a way worst outcome . 
  it was mostly is ego that got bruised luckly . 
  he ran into that small pond that can kinda be seen in picture 2 and swimmed to the middle , after a few minutes the cows got bored and went away . 
  he did look kinda depressed for a couple of days but then he went back to [ normal ] ( http://imgur.com/v5wmugk ) . 
  that one time my dog tried to attack a group of cows [ 1 ] ( http://imgur.com/htqqj0q ) , [ 2 ] ( http://imgur.com/kfpyvab ) , [ 3 ] ( http://imgur.com/tlk1gyz ) . 
  not pictured , he tripped and the cows beat the crap out of him . 
  no idea . 
  as far as i know ( like 3 or 4 generations before me ) , everyone seems to be from the same 3 regions ( that neighbour each other ) . 
  lol , yeah . 
  some of them are kinda strange , might have something to do with immigrants ( yuri is also allowed now ( : ) . 
  one of the first things we would learn in english classes was that names are not supposed to be translated but there are names that sound quite similar , in your case it would be [ sim\u00e3o ] ( https://pt.forvo.com/word/sim%c3%a3o/ ) . 
  not iceland but here we literally have a list of [ allowed names ] ( http://www.irn.mj.pt/sections/irn/a_registral/registos-centrais/docs-da-nacionalidade/vocabulos-admitidos-e/downloadfile/file/lista_de_nomes2016-06-30.pdf ) . 
  a mix of keeping the heritage and protecting the kids from being called something stupid . 
  here in portugal . 
  the most popular area is probably the [ algarve region ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=algarve&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg1iy1_5dvahvbvxqkhsv7apmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1438&amp;bih=685 ) but i usually go for the [ alentejo coastal areas ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=algarve&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg1iy1_5dvahvbvxqkhsv7apmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1438&amp;bih=685#tbm=isch&amp;q=alentejo+beaches&amp;spf=1500317820920 ) . personal favorites are [ vila nova de milfontes ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=algarve&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg1iy1_5dvahvbvxqkhsv7apmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1438&amp;bih=685#tbm=isch&amp;q=vila+nova+de+milfontes&amp;spf=1500317820922 ) and [ odeceixe ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=algarve&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg1iy1_5dvahvbvxqkhsv7apmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1438&amp;bih=685#tbm=isch&amp;q=odeceixe&amp;spf=1500317820924 ) . 
  my vacation is usually at the beginning of october and the weather is still ok-ish to go to the beach . 
  i assume it might be the same in most mediterranean areas . 
  i saw a dude in a youtube vlog describing it as `` everyone thinks they are a rally driver '' . 
  the only different sauce that i can remember from portugal is [ piri piri sauce ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/41gkkmfqmml.jpg ) . 
  caf\u00e9s and restaurants in tourist areas will have it , you should be ok . 
  for a first trip i would probably recommend the classics , paris , rome , london , berlin , barcelona . 
  gets kinda [ hot ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6n0gjh/portugal_is_lava_again/ ) in the summer . 
  usually 40 hours week , monday to friday ( except for people who work shifts and/or weekends obviously ) . 
  one hour for lunch ( not included in those 8 daily hours ) . 
  in the beginning there was a little of backlash from some people ( as is usual when a big number of immigrants arrive in a country ) . 
  nowadays the ukrainian population is mostly assimilated around the country and usually seen as hard workers . 
  whenever an american starts a rant about foreigners moving to their country i immediately think about them . 
  as far as i know i never met one . 
  kind of a poor selection here ( 2360 ) titles so i end up re watching the same a lot ( i 've seen s1 of daredevil like 10 times ), 
  here is what i could find ( results from ine ( national institute of statistics ) ) : [ immigration to portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_portugal ) . 
  tl : dr : former portuguese colonies , ukranians and chinese are the majority of non-eu . 
  depends : interior - little to none ( mostly elderly german and british couples ) . 
  lisbon - a lot . 
  costal areas - the further down south you go the more there are . 
  algarve region ( mediterranean ) - like locusts . 
  i always assumed that it was a portuguese thing until i saw an episode of modern family where the colombian one wanted grapes for new years . 
  we still use them unfortunately . 
  for some reason we do it with raisins ... 
  in the top 10 of the most common . 
  mother side does n't show up in the top 100 . 
  never done any of them despite being portuguese but every year i see the madeira one on the news and it looks amazing . 
  if you do decide to go , you really should think about booking everything as fast as you can as hotels tend to sell-out . 
  around 2200 $, 
  portugal is n't mentioned so that seems accurate . 
  the bo kinda pissed me off a little personally but it is true that some random lazy person can fuck it up for the rest of us . 
  does n't that create situations where the parents ( or you in this case ) get stuck on something and really ca n't understand it ? 
  i remember kids that had to be explained stuff in like 5 different ways before they got it . 
  i dont like it . 
  im not familiar with the studies but it just seems cruel to deprive children of that experience . 
  since we are on this topic , just a couple of questions you might be able to answer me : how can we be sure that parents are qualified to teach ? 
  is there like homeschool material that parents buy ? 
  because i definetely could not teach a child . 
  do the kids still have to do tests or exams in schools to prove that they are being teached ? 
  if yes , do they do it with the other kids or how does that work ? 
  recently i ate what my wife called `` the closest to the pizzas that i tried in italy '' ( i have never been there ) . 
  i really was not expecting it to be that good . 
  a little strange at first but past the initial shock there would be no pressure for you to do it . 
  `` so , this is like a province of spain ? '', 
  or `` you guys speak brazillian right ? '',
