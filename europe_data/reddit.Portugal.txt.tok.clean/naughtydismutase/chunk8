   wine ? 
  do n't even think about wine . 
  a bottle that costs 6 chf at a supermarket is sold for 50 chf at a restaurant just because they open that shit for you and pour it into your glass . 
  one time i nearly shit myself after seeing my bill for a 2 person meal ( no first , no dessert ) was 130chf 'cause of wine . 
   in ~ ~ angola ~ ~ , 20 $ . 
  luanda, 
  what kind of coop is this that sells such cheap salads ... 
  more than 15 euros . 
  ( switzerland ), 
  welcome to the club , ireland . 
  nope . 
  all saints day ( 1st of november ) , or st martin 's day ( 11th of november ) . 
  you foreigners are taking this way out of proportion . 
  there 's no constitutional crisis . 
  spain or italy . 
  i currently live in switzerland , though . 
  200 people representing 10 million does n't look bad to me . 
  this man is a filthy pig , so gross . 
  agreed . 
  and that 's what 's going to happen . 
  the budget will be failed in the parliament , the government will fall , new elections will be scheduled , and psd+cds will win with majority . 
   claiming that they are radically anti-european strong language ? 
  they are . 
  the left parties did not come to an agreement strong enough to form a coalition . 
  seems very simple to me that the next step is to appoint the winners as the government . 
  no , it 's not . 
  the centre-right won the elections ( without a majority ) . 
  the president had a deadline to appoint a new government . 
  the left parties tried to come to an agreement in order to form a coalition that would give them the majority . 
  they failed to do so in time for the appointment , which means the winner of the elections is elected for government . 
  simple . 
  it 's the best time to send a message . 
  because you are drunk ( or pretend to be ) , you will be more straightforward . 
  if you regret it the next day , you can blame it on the booze . 
  if you say something _ really _ straightforward , for sure they will remember you . 
  am a portuguese girl ; surprisingly accurate . 
   1689 , borns john v of portugal , the portuguese sun-king or the magnificient . 
  he was a very religious man , granting several donatives to the church and special to the vatican , pope benedict xiv granted him the title of `` most faithful majesty '' , churchs , monsteries , embassies to france , rome , china , etc. . . john v did n't spare any costs in order to proclaim the name of portugal outside of its empire . 
  thus began our financial decline , later greatly accelerated 5 years after john 's death with the 1755 earthquake . 
  is it only eu business or countries like switzerland would end up adopting this shit too ? 
  holy shit that 's too much golden, 
  people were fucking stupid back then . 
  they still are , but still ... 
  funny thing is switzerland has and fosters some of the most advanced bio/pharma industry/research/r & d in the world . 
   was offered drugs everywhere those were not drugs , they were cooking ingredients . 
  drugs are one hell of a drug . 
  very far away . 
  i failed sunday school . 
  yes , you can fail it . 
  you 're not nordic , that 's for sure !, 
  [ we 'll always be there for you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cenzhro8aaq ), 
  ... you single ? 
  which part of swiss romande are you from ? 
  i 've been living wrongly all my life then . 
  i love you too . 
  come at me bro, 
  we were never part of spain . 
  if you were about to negotiate getting billions of euros you would cover your dicks too . 
  of all the things you could show , you decide to show barreiro ... 
  i hate you all . 
  correlation does not equal causation . 
  he 's a ridiculous twat and i do n't know why anyone gives him attention . 
  i 'm not that proud of that moment in our history , because it came at the cost of a regicide ... 
  really ? 
  only today ? 
  desenrascan\u00e7o has lead me to where i am today . 
  and i 'm not that bad . 
  if we can hold our borders until 2043 , that would be ~ ~ 1000 ~ ~ 900 years of independence . 
  that 's big . 
  thank you !, 
  honestly , portuguese people do n't count spain as being `` abroad '' !, 
  you know there 's something seriously wrong when even hitler ca n't stand you . 
  salazar hated franco though . 
  election yesterday , center-right pro-austerity coalition won . 
  i suppose that 's why he 's so down . 
  jealous ? 
  25 , is that good enough ? 
  i 'm not living in portugal and now i want p\u00e3o com chouri\u00e7o . 
  but apparently it makes germany hot in their swimsuit special places . 
  thank you !, 
  i will always admire those sneaky bastards that shifted the line a little bit ... yay brazil !, 
  we have one , pnr , but they are racist criminals and no one takes them seriously . 
  thank you !, 
  ^ send ^ help, 
   so salazar time is counted as republic time ? 
  yes , it 's called the `` 2nd republic '' . 
  we are living the 3rd republic in the present . 
  i was not aware of this . 
  anyway , it 's good to know !, 
  this is news to me . 
   portugal may be the first country to reelect a pro-austerity coalition it 's just one of those things that you 're not sure whether it 's brilliant or stupid . 
  they were once social democrats . 
  now they 're just shit . 
  few things are better than a [ salada de polvo ( octopus salad ) ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/2779770896_211eb761de.jpg ) or a [ arroz de polvo ( octopus rice ) ] ( http://c4.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b5e07a58d/10363195_2deyv.jpeg ) . 
  one of those things is squid . 
  squid is just amazing . 
  pretty sure we have the best stereotype in this list . 
  was n't aware snails , octopus , and liver were weird . 
  because they taste absolutely delicious .
