  what country in western europe can be considered more backwards than italy in these issues ? 
  in western europe ? 
  portugal is on the same level as you your examples and we have gay marriage and abortion . 
  `` importance of religion '' hardly means anything . 
  what happened in 77 in afghanistan ? 
  that 's my birgitte, 
  is that a joke on his name ? 
  he 's got a website . 
  that 's pop . 
  no because im 21 . 
  you can even see the bridge in lisbon . 
  i hope someone someday says you 're the same as piss . 
   as an example of an awful architectural mistake , one of the worst buildings i can think of in lisbon would probably be franjinhas [ 2 ] please , franjinhas is a great building . 
  yea , you would probably have to ask specifically for a heineken , asking for a beer will get either sagres or super bock . 
  it 's not like that for same sex marriages , it does n't have to be like that for married children . 
  jesus , bugger off , it was a light hearted comment . 
  they recently ( about 4 years ) introduced `` moderation fees '' as an incentive for people not to use the nhs so much . 
  but poor people do n't have to pay it and and those who do , it 's like 20 $ tops . 
  however pregnancy related things never had to pay moderation fees , except for abortion which is now the same as other pregnancy things . 
  and there was also the issue with the forced appointments with a psychologist before an abortion , which are now optional . 
  i like to trust german work ethic . 
  selva 's jungle in portuguese . 
  privatize the psas ? 
  no wet team photo, 
  pretty sure the imf is talking about a keynesianism effect . 
  migrate to portugal . 
  in portuguese mans\u00e3o is the word for manor/big monumental house, 
  that 's the name for one of the greek yogurt products in portugal , but pronounced oikos . 
  i would guess it 's the personal definitions of assault . 
  one might consider behind pushed twice assault and someone else might only consider being punched to the ground assault . 
  and more people to work with . 
  and we 're not spain !, 
  it 's not he same islam so to say , i 'm not the best person to explain this and i ca n't really cite anything so only believe me if you want , but from what i 've read some time ago there was a shift in most of the islamic world where critical thinking start being heavily discouraged , i think this was around the same time sharia started being actually implemented as a power move by a certain political group . 
  i wish someone could refine my explanation . 
   all that will happen is less educated demographics will doubly replace the native one less educated demographics are not inherently foreigners  populations start dying off in the next 20 years , and the 20yr old cohort then is primarily made up of those demographics , not the native educated one 's children . 
  which should n't be a problem if there 's a good education system to back up social mobility . 
  what are family safety nets, 
  i would just like share a personal story about the portuguese nhs . 
  some years ago i sprained my knee , i stayed home recovering the first few days and tried to get an appointment with my family doctor , waited about 2 weeks for that , he sends me to an orthopedist , waited 2 months for that , he has me have an x-ray , waited 2 weeks for that , meanwhile i already had scheduled another orthopedist appointment for 2 months after the first one . 
  when i finally get there with the exam , i 'm told to wait until it heals . 
  it was n't bad enough to have an expensive treatment used on me . 
  a couple of months ago , i sprained my knee again , this time much worse , and in canada . 
  i went to the doctor after 1 day in bed , my very expensive international student insurance covered all the appointments ( and 1 cab ride ! ), 
  but i still had to pay a little bit too much for the painkillers and anti-imflammatories , they also told me to get crutches but i did n't because they were too expensive for the few days i would need them . 
  the same day of the emergency appointment i get an x-ray , also covered but it does n't show anything because it 's too swollen , the nurse advises me to go the er , i did n't go because it was too far away and i could tell that i was getting worse because of all the walking/limping around that day between healthcare services and pharmacies and i was running tight on money so a cab really was n't an option . 
  i just go home and spend one week in bed with ice and painkilers and lots of protein so i could go back to school asap . 
  when i arrived in portugal about 1 month later i scheduled a family doctor 's appointment , at this time it 's not longer urgent enough to go to the er , and i had to wait 3 weeks for that appointment which is this week , and he 'll probably send me to the orthopedist and then i 'll probably have to demand to have this looked at again because it 's the third time i sprain my knee . 
  all hail the supreme leader, 
  lined up behind the pillar so security would n't see you ? 
  let 's see for portugal ; * april 25th , [ the carnatian revolution of 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ) , a military staged coup that ** terminated the dictatorship ** ( because of the military dissatisfaction with their treatment by the government , not really a grand gesture toward democracy as it came to be celebrated because it did result in democracy afterwards ) , no blood was shed from the military side . 
  * july 10th , [ the day of portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal_day ) , a nationalistic holiday , established by the first republic , on the day that marks the anniversary of the death of the portuguese epic poet luis de cam\u00f5es , this day is also used to ** celebrate the portuguese diaspora ** , and is heavily celebrated by portuguese communities abroad . 
  * october 5th , [ the establishment of the republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_october_1910_revolution ) - removed as a holiday as part of austerity measures but it will probably be restored soon - in 1910 when after a series of events over the past 20 years that lead to dissatisfaction with the monarchy and a ** regicide ** , a republic was established . 
  * december 1st , [ the restoration of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_restoration_war ) - also removed , same as above - when in 1640 , portugal regained it 's i ** ndependence after a 60 year dynastic union with spain . 
  shit , yea . 
  he 's 21 . edit : my mistake, 
  funny that it does n't have an article in portuguese . 
   a literal wasteland before 1 may 2004 . 
  was n't it though ? 
  nc 's got more facebook like 's than livre though . 
  does that mean anything ? 
  alentejo is the only place where cdu ( communists ) get majorities . 
  a lot of cities are ruled by them . 
  it 's probably based off her wealth, 
   we are not a tropical country . 
  it rains a lot in tropical countries . 
  kids playing online video games . 
  what 's obvious about houston ? 
  yea . 
  i was an exchange student in halifax , ns for 4 months . 
  loved ns , would go back . 
  that 's such a german way to be . 
  portugal is lisbon . 
  the rest is landscape . 
  without knowing norwegian history i can guess that that was a dynastic union . 
  ahah do n't worry i was n't talking about myself but you 'll need a project to build a house . 
  ( also , a good architect saves you money  wet , yea , north , near geres . 
  check out geres national park for landscape reference . 
  around ponte de lima/viana do castelo/braga . 
  yea . 
  low cost of living . 
  almost everyone under 30 speaks decent english . 
  good internet . 
  it may be a bit too hot in some parts but it 's very manageable , especially if you 're building a new , nicely insulated and ventilated house . 
  and we have a program going on right now where if you 're qualified and move here u do n't have to pay irs ( income tax ) for like 5 years or something like that . 
  and if you invest more than 500k $ in your house you automatically get a green card . 
  hmu if u need an architect , 
  this is an article about the way kids are raised in portugal ( lisbon ) by an english lady ( lucy pepper ) that moved here some years ago . 
  http://observador.pt/opiniao/nao-e-tempo-de-as-criancas-irem-para-a-cama/ english original text after the portuguese translation . 
  here as well : ** no time for the children to go to bed ** `` last night , walking home at midnight , after an evening out , we were passed on the street by a family with a tiny kid , happily being bounced around on his mother 's shoulders . 
  it reminded me of one of the main reasons i love bringing up my kids here in portugal . 
  here , children are treated as a blessing at all hours of the day and night , and make up an integral part of all of life . 
  you can take kids almost anywhere in portugal . 
  we 're all in it together . 
  in the uk , it is an entirely different story . 
  try taking a small kid to a restaurant that does n't supply a kids ' menu and a massive supply of wipeable high chairs , and you will not feel entirely welcome . 
  there are places that are designated as `` family '' where you are allowed to take small kids , and they are invariably awful . 
  `` family restaurants '' with kids ' menus supplying unspeakably bad food from the freezer , or `` family pubs '' with special foamy rubbery wipeable surfaced play areas . 
  `` family friendly '' anything usually denotes somewhere that has sticky patches , brightly coloured plastic or foam rubber , bad coffee and an all pervading smell of wee . 
  they are awful because that 's where all the children are , because they ca n't go anywhere else . 
  they are awful because that 's where kids are facilitated in their awfulness , allowed to run amok and be crazy , threatening to break their necks or lick some norovirus off the bouncy castle walls .
