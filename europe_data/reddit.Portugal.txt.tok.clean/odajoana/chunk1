view from my workplace : [ downtown lisbon ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kx5cv ), 
   will these removals just have a streisand effect though . 
  after reading this article i am now going to look up who stan o ` neil is now . 
  that 's the thing i do n't get about this . 
  surely , anytime something gets taken down , it 's going to get mentioned or generate even more curiosity therefore getting even more attention . 
  that 's how the internet works . 
  so what 's the point ? 
   `` santa cona do assobio '' i 'd never heard this one . 
  it 's so beautiful . 
  that are very few jobs here that require german . 
  english , french and more recently spanish are the ones worth learning , when it comes to getting a job . 
  again , i apologize for this thread . 
  we 're usually nice people . 
  you 're right , there would be a difference . 
  pepe would have headbutted everyone in the face . 
  on my behalf and of other wiser portuguese redditors , i do apologize for this thread . 
  they 're still trolls . 
  you ignore them , you do n't step to their level . 
  stop feeding them . 
  they 're trolls !, 
  they 're not suposed to be taken seriously . 
  how is this hard to understand . 
  you ignore them , and in the morning you delete their posts . 
  internet 101 . 
  oh , for ... do not take this seriously . 
  they 're coming from / r/murica . 
  it 's a satirical sub for americans . 
  they 're trolling , they are just doing it for fun and for some reason it 's been taken seriously . 
  * facepalm * edit : also , posting this to r/europe ? 
  `` mommy , mommy , the big kids are making fun of me . '', 
  seriously ? 
  there might have been a couple of debatable cases , but i do n't think the referree was the issue here . 
  portugal sucked today . 
  reeaally sucked . 
  surely someone forgot to tell jo\u00e3o moutinho that his mates were the dudes in red , not in white , and oh my god , pepe is just the dumbest player in the whole world . 
  seriously . 
  it was ronaldo and jo\u00e3o pereira against everyone else . 
  i 'm surprised germany is n't winning 6-0 or more , really . 
  i think some of the portuguese players are actually playing for germany . 
  is reboleira still in progress ? 
  i heard the works were interrupted due to lack of financing , but maybe that 's just a rumour then . 
  i believe work on arroios , anjos and intendente has n't begun yet ( and i 'll be very surprised if it starts at all ) and areeiro has being going on for ever . 
  there are many other stations that need improvement , though . 
  campo grande for instance almost falls apart when it rains for 5 minutes . 
  same with marqu\u00eas and avenida . 
  so , is everyone in europe building/renovating their metro lines ? 
  god , it must be good to have money . 
  it 's generally ignored but i think everyone still knows it 's around this time of year and it 's still taken seriously by television . 
  also , i know a lot of people that watch . 
  but then again , it might be mostly because i make them do so . 
  great performance , totally deserved it . 
  not really . 
  i get it 's not everyone 's cup of tea . 
  personally , i love it . 
  the one week a year every country does their best to make a fool out of themselves , while being fully aware of it . 
  watching eurovision and browsing twitter at the same time or watching it with some friends makes for a totally different experience . 
  and going through the portuguese selection is awesome . 
  it 's been 50 years , we never won a thing , but still , every single year , people get outraged like it 's the end of the world . 
  they never like the winner or the song , so they come up with the best rants ever on the internet , saying how much undeserving it was and how songs were so much better in the 70 's . 
  the drama and the sillyness of it are worth it . 
  makes me go to my happy place . 
  personally , i feel like the whole experience of watching it and following twitter at the same time is rather fun . 
  as a country , we just do n't care anymore . 
  it 's been more than 50 years after our first time there and we never won . 
  ever . 
  i even doubt the common portuguese person knows any of the songs that were on through the last 10 years . 
  heck , we could n't even financially afford to participate last year . 
  we have a deep amount of respect for most of our entries up until early 80 's , though . 
  we had some great songs . 
  amazing ones , in fact . 
  i linked facebook as to direct to the page of the photographer , but sic did a report on him and showed some of the pictures . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://youtu.be/vpj2mjq56v4 ) , if you do n't mind a youtube link . 
  i just was getting ready to post that very same picture of [ salgueiro maia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salgueiro_maia ) but you beat me to it . 
  that 's definitely one of the most iconic photos we have from that time . 
  there are others like [ this one ] ( http://c6.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/g8d1646fe/16873650_fcifw.jpeg ) and [ this one ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vmzxjeluijq/sbifo0w4iqi/aaaaaaaabo8/w04cczpkhbi/s1600-h/2-fmaia\\ ( salgueiro + maia-rua + do + arsenal \\ ) . bmp ) , i believe , depicting the events at rua do arsenal . 
  ( i ca n't find it with a better resolution , unfortunately ) . 
  also , a while ago some color photographs emerged from that day , [ which are very cool ] ( https://www.facebook.com/jorge.dasilvahorta/media_set?set=a.10206509262760289.1073741829.1531882724&amp;type=1 ) . 
  yeah , i think it 's pretty much a reddit thing . 
  my perception is that irl people are ok with the current flag and its colours . 
  to be honest , i think the most probable outcome of a fight between a portuguese and brazilian would be one of them inviting the other over and watching whatever football match is on over a few drinks . 
  ** a cr\u00f3nica dos bons malandros ** is not a masterpiece and i have no idea if it translates well to english or if it 's even translated at all , but it 's one of the most fun books i ever read . 
  ** os maias ** is a bit bulky and wordy but it 's absolutely worth it . 
  in my opinion , it 's one of the best books ( if not * the * best ) ever written in portuguese . 
  [ ricardo parreira ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdf-bbweicg ) is quite good and usually works with a lot of famous fado singers . 
  but [ carlos paredes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sysypbakiqq ) is `` the big name '' when it comes to portuguese guitar . 
  it 's not * entirely * innacurate , but the overall tone of the post makes me a bit uneasy as well . 
  it was probably not intended , but it comes off as a bit offensive and rude . 
  we love having tourists around . 
  it 's great to see foreign people being surprised by our little country . 
  and we love providing them with a great experience too . 
  even if you say `` gracias !, 
  '' , believing it to be a portuguese word , we 're still going to be helpful and nice to you . 
  there might be a slight twitch in our eye and we might go on for a couple of hours explaining all the 10.000 ways we 're different from spain , but we 'll still help you . 
  we do make fun of the portuguese emmigrants that come from france , though . 
  but that does n't count ; that 's making fun of ourselves . 
  how could i forget that ? 
  it 's beautiful . 
  i 'll see your handshake fail and i 'll raise you [ our president happily hoisting our flag upside down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zmxme2hvda ) . 
  came here to say this . 
  no love for azores .
