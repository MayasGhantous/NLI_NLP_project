  :( but honestly , we 'd be totally fine with this . 
  it 's a joke act . 
  that particular song is actually a good attempt at a proper song , but the whole act and the band are intended to be taken as a parody/homage of portuguese intervention singers and the revolutionary spirit in the 70 's . 
  [ jos\u00e9 m\u00e1rio branco ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a41vqms1zmk ) , for instance , [ is definitely a major influence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl49toe9_3e ) . 
  they are actors and they had a semi-popular comedy show , where they created these characters and whould crash events and protests and just be silly , shouting stuff like `` the politicians take all our money !, 
  we want bmws too ! '', 
  and that sort of vague complaints . 
  it eventually lead into song writing . 
  a lot of people resented them for winning , saying that the contest was not being taking seriously . 
  honestly , i enjoyed it a lot . 
  we have never won and we are never going to win , so might as well have some fun . 
  their press realeases were absolutely amazing . 
  we 've sent songs in portuguese with some verses in english , but other than , i believe you 're right . 
  50 years and we 've never sent a song fully sung in english . 
  that 's actually pretty impressive . 
  senhora do mar is a good song that was very well performed . 
  regarding last year , i found her voice to be a bit lacking , but maybe she 's just inexperienced ( she 's rather young ) . 
  honestly , we have n't been trying to send a decent song in a long , long time . 
  which sucks because portuguese music has never been in such a good phase as now ( a lot of good bands and songs going around ) . 
  and we 're not in it . 
  exactly , that `` competition '' was totally not taken seriously by anyone . 
  [ spain - portugal ] ( http://www.limitezero.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dsc_4631.jpg ), 
  that 's a comedy sketch , btw , so it 's deliberately exaggerated to mock the accent / u/empirestateofmadness talked about . 
  even the woman in the white dress , who is the `` celebrity '' we most associate with that accent is joining the fun and making fun of herself . 
  so , during summer , everyone just wakes up at 5:30 am even at weekends ? 
   coffee is always an espresso . 
  anything else is ` dirty dish water ' . 
  hear , hear . 
  i get that there is n't much sun in the uk , so houses getting hot is not an issue , but the light ? 
  how can anyone sleep with full daylight coming into their room ? 
  it just blows my mind . 
  portugal too ( we even spell it the same way ) . 
  it 's usually one of the biggest culture shocks that portuguese people feel when they have to live abroad . 
  [ does fog count as a white christmas ? 
  what exactly is a christmas market ? 
  i have to admit i 've never seen a frozen mass of water in my life other than in pictures . 
  heck , i 've only seen snow a couple of times really . 
  tomorrow 's going to rain , though . 
   in lisbon sometime you can get 5/6 \u00b0 c is very rare to go below that . 
  and that would be at around 5 am in one of the coldest days of the year . 
  in lisbon , more of imaginary . 
  you 're more than welcomed . 
  bring money . 
  fair point , but the other pictures mention winter and are very winter-like . 
  it was meant to keep to the theme . 
  yeah , 16\u00bac is definitely chilly for our standards . 
  indeed , according to [ ipma ] ( https://www.ipma.pt/en/otempo/obs.tempo.presente/ ) , 15.6 \u00bac . 
  translation of the article ( apologies for any mistakes ) :  ** `` pop galo '' , a barcelos rooster planted on the tagus waterfront **  `` pop galo , '' the new project by artist joana vasconcelos was set last wednesday at ribeira das naus . 
  the ten meters high piece means to celebrate the web summit . 
   *  it 's ten meters high and weighs nearly four tons . 
  pop galo , the new work of joana vasconcelos , was placed this wednesday by the tagus river , in avenida da ribeira das naus , to mark the beginning of the web summit , which starts next monday . 
  the giant galo de barcelos , lined with 17.000 tiles , is one of many projects that make up the `` portuguese showcase '' that the government wants to create to promote the best of portugal . 
   ana mendes godinho , secretary of state of tourism , explained that `` what joana vasconcelos did was take advantage of our much known traditional galo de barcelos and turn it into a technological cock , ten meters high , built with tiles '' which by night will be illuminated by 16,000 led lights . 
  `` during the day will look as one thing , at night , another '' she said . 
   the piece began to be built about a year and a half ago , and was lined with tiles from the vi\u00fava lamego factory , founded in 1849 , as it was explained by the artist to rtp . 
  in addition to the led lights , it includes nine meters of electrical cables . 
  `` it 's a large-scale object , '' concludes joana vasconcelos . 
  the public can interact with the piece through a qr code and `` select a color and with that color select a piece of music made by jonas runa '' , a lisbon composer . 
   speaking to the newspaper p\u00fablico , the artist said that the work is a revisitation `` of pop culture '' . 
  `` the mix of unusual materials that combined give a kind of new version of our environment . 
  here , what i mix are leds with tiles , and it 's the leds that give a technological side to this cock . 
  and it 's the technology that allows greater interaction with the public . '', 
   the construction work was completed on wednesday , but the pop galo will only be officially presented on sunday at 17.00 , at a ceremony that will be attended by prime minister ant\u00f3nio costa . 
  from ribeira das naus , it will be then taken to beijing for the celebrations of the chinese new year . 
  do check the picture gallery on the article , it 's pretty cool how they assembled it . 
  also , for a better look at it , from the lisboa live facebook page : [ photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jwwk0cm.jpg ), 
   i got ta ask , were you serious when you said people wear winter coats at +25 c temperatures instead of sweating their balls off in t-shirt and shorts ? 
  because it sounds like a joke finnish people might say at southern europeans . 
  to be fair , it 's been raining now and then and it does get a bit chilly early in the morning and in the evenings , after sundown , which is mostly when people commute and are on the streets . 
  but yeah , we definitely have a total different concept of cold . 
   por portuguese  por pora portuguese ( any other )  por porb portuguese ( brazil ) do n't know about the others , but this division makes sense . 
  last time jamie oliver decided to share a recipe for * bacalhau \u00e0 br\u00e1s * , a typical portuguese dish , [ everyone was all over him too ] ( http://portugalresident.com/jamie-oliver-creates-humungous-%e2%80%98bacalhau-%c3%a0-br%c3%a1s%e2%80%99-furore ) . 
  he should know better not to mess with iberian food . 
  edit : typo . 
  if it 's any consolation , i did n't know what it was either . 
  and [ naperons ] ( http://c5.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/b3205d75f/7407651_ormlo.jpeg ) . 
  personal taste should n't matter . 
  you ca n't deny he is very popular , both here and abroad . 
  they 're our version of coldplay , basically . 
  great sucess at first , now it 's the band it 's cool to hate . 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ said , ^ ^ their ^ ^ album ^ ^ `` o ^ ^ caminho ^ ^ da ^ ^ felicidade '' ^ ^ is ^ ^ probably ^ ^ one ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ best ^ ^ portuguese ^ ^ music ^ ^ albuns ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ 90 's . 
  it still hurts . 
  you can do it in just one word . 
  we spent all our money on highways and let the railroads rot . 
  so , the same way portuguese people `` speak spanish '' , when what they actually do is speak portuguese slower and louder ? 
  not the op , but this [ wiki section on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_lisbon_earthquake#effect_on_society.2c_economy_and_philosophy ) should give you a general idea . 
  this is beautiful . 
  it 's also originally a brazilian `` forr\u00f3 '' song . 
  that song is not actually a fado , but a pop song with fado influences . 
  same with `` desfado '' posted above . 
  [ it 's mostly the lack of hat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/216_2310-fernando-pessoa.jpg/200px-216_2310-fernando-pessoa.jpg ) . 
   olivenza ( oliven\u00e7a ) - spain ( portugal ) i see what you did there . 
   and [ portuguese guitar ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b1/0f/98/b10f981fad6489cbaf71d77b4005a3d9.jpg ) ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ portuguese ^ ^ guitar . 
  i know the guy , but i do n't think he has the most popular song right now . 
  if anything , probably something by anselmo ralph . 
  or d.a.m.a. 
  honestly , snow is beautiful and all that , but we have to work and move about and our [ * cal\u00e7ada * ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gtve6mpkubu/td0mmzi1cji/aaaaaaaadio/qefivu1draw/s1600/rossio%2bbaixa%2bchiado%2bportuguese%2bpavement%2blisbon%2bcity%2btour%2bportugal%2broc2c%2b%2bstreet%2blimestone%2bdetail%2bstars%2bpattern%2bstone%2bcal%25c3%25a7ada%2bportuguesa%2bestrela%2bpasseio%2bsidewalk%2bpreta%2bbranca.jpg ) is slippery as it is . 
  also , traffic becomes insane when 3 drops of rain fall , i ca n't even imagine what it would be like if it snowed . 
  so no , thank you , i 'm ok with these cold sunny days we 're having . 
  no , he 's not .
