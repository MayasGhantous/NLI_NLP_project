  only a very small minority has salazar in high regard and half of it are internet trolls . 
  that whole contest/poll was trolled and not taken seriously , because of how silly it was to try and elect `` the best portuguese '' via text message . 
  and obviously it would all take place at a restaurant , over lunch . 
  i 've replied to another user about this . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ly7ud/sao_martinho_do_porto_portugal/dbzn5wt/ ) , 
  while i agree there should be a lot more thinking going into urban planning , lousy accesses and no accomodation near the beach would mean fewer visitors . 
  i 'm not sure it 's doable in this place ( the rocks act as a shield from the wind ) , but there 's definitely a very good spot just a few kilometres south , at [ foz do arelho/lagoa de \u00d3bidos ] ( http://oesteportugal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lagoa1.jpg ) . 
  [ lots of praticioners there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eawp42yzl54 ) . 
  also , a few kilometres north and you have nazar\u00e9 , home of some of [ the biggest waves ever surfed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdtrmscxbg ) . 
  the sea seems to have been a mess that day ; [ the waters are usually a lot calmer and bluer ] ( https://youtu.be/zdjzc1q4pmy?t=396 ) . 
  [ is n't this actually in the pena park ? 
  ] ( http://www.serradesintra.net/parque-da-pena/lagos-no-paque-da-pena ) regaleira is different - though no less awesome - place . 
  [ the place seems to have been restored a couple of years ago ] ( https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/noticias/conclusao-da-recuperacao-do-vale-dos-lagos-e-jardim-das-camelias-no-parque-da-pena/ ) .

  i just love that we welcomed the king of spain in [ guimar\u00e3es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_s\u00e3o_mamede ) which is the place where we founded our country back in 1128 , and during the week of the 1st of december , a holiday which celebrates [ our independence after 60 years of spanish rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_restoration_war ) . 
  it 's like we 're saying : `` spain , we love you but do n't get any ideas . '', 
  this is absolutely hideous . 
  in fact , the christmas lights this year in lisbon are overall terrible . 
  see , this is why your ~ ~ your ~ ~ education system gets praised . 
  possesion under a certain amount is decriminalised . 
  you wo n't go to jail , but authorities may still confiscate them and you may have to go to a sort of `` counselling session '' to assess whether you need help with ~ ~ addition ~ ~ addiction or not . 
  but internet - and especially the american audience in reddit - lives to boast how portugal is doing well on its `` war on drugs '' by allowing people to use them , when that 's not the case . 
  not a week goes by without a tourist creating a thread in / r/portugal on how to buy drugs while they 're on holiday here . 
  it gets annoying after a while . 
  edit : typo . 
  oh my , a repeatedly widespread piece of information that is n't true ? 
  \\* gasp * shocking !, 
  what are they going to say next ? 
  that drugs are n't legal in portugal ? 
  in portuguese we do n't say `` swallow camels '' but `` swallow frogs '' ( `` engolir sapos '' ) , but i believe it 's same meaning as the norwegian one . 
  to be fair , a flower vase would be better than the last one . 
  indeed , we have to wear coats . 
  it 's preposterous . 
   to be fair it was originally called salazar bridge . 
  and lisbon was originally called olisipo . 
  things change . 
  all being still within living memory , it 's hard to take a neutral approach to analysing that period . 
  people 's stance usually depends a lot on the status quo of those people 's family at that time . 
  if those families had possesions , land or were a part of the retornados group ( the refugees who had to flee the african colonies after the revolution ) , yeah , they 're going to have a pretty favourable opinion of salazar . 
  if they were the ones who were starving and had to abandon school at the age of 11 because they had to financially help their families , they 're pretty much going to be against him . 
  i still believe it was a result of massive troll voting . 
  the whole contest was idiotic , by equating historical figures with soap opera actors and everyone saw through that . 
  if ever the tagus river has waves that can overcome that pier , that means lisbon in trouble . 
  in portugal , if we do n't see the sun , it 's a terrible day . 
  more so in lisbon , where the light reflected in the river [ gives the city ] ( http://cdn.olhares.pt/client/files/foto/big/845/8453749.jpg ) an extra brightness . 
  crap weather in the photo , though . 
  :( guess you were unlucky . 
  lisbon is so much more beautiful under a bright blue sky . 
  what you described is what we do at wakes , but minus the food . 
  the family sits with the body , friends and distant family come by to pay their respects , everyone deals with it the best they can and then there 's the funeral . 
  after that , everyone goes home . 
   food is not even served in portuguese funerals !, 
  this . 
  we associate food with pleasant moments , happy family reunions , celebrations , that sort of thing . 
  it 'd be incredibly disrespectful to eat at a funeral or a wake ( and who the hell gets hungry around dead bodies ? 
  oh , by reading your comment i thought you meant there were ads instructing people how to use facebook , which would be weird . 
  but that 's a privacy warning ad , and with info that many people might not be aware of , so it makes sense . 
  people can be quite careless with the info they share . 
  i have to say those complaints are baffling to me too . 
  : / i have heard some complaints regarding food in portugal , but most were to do with the fact people were vegetarian or vegan and portuguese cuisine is very meat and fish based , so it 's harder to have that lifestyle . 
  i also get that lisbon might not be as multicultural as other european capitals , so it may be harder to find diversity in restaurants . 
  i 've never heard anyone call our food `` oily '' as well , but people will have different tastes , so there 's that . 
  but to say that you ca n't find vegetables ? 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's just bizarre . 
  august is the peak of summer , so obviously it 's going to be very hot . 
  do n't forget your jackets then . 
   we find the food and available options to be lacking . 
  that 's weird . 
  are you vegetarian or something ? 
  because if so , then yes , you 're going to have a hard time in portugal , but other than that i find your complaint , well ... odd . 
  you can find pretty much fresh food and good ingredients anywhere in portugal . 
  i 've never been to spain , so i ca n't compare . 
  why do you say it 's different here ? 
  the atlantic says hi . 
  sintra and caldas da rainha . 
  those are the spots where you want to be during heat waves . 
  according to [ wunderground ] ( https://www.wunderground.com ) , right now , in lisbon , it 's 31\u00bac , but in sintra , it 's ** 22,9 \u00bac ** and in caldas , ** 21\u00bac ** . 
  this is what , a 100km radius , overall ? 
  it 's insane . 
  it just rained intensely for 5 minutes in lisbon . 
  gets the portuguese flag right for once , explains a brazilian-only idiom . 
  indeed , vila real de santo ant\u00f3nio is [ a lot ] ( http://cms.cm-vrsa.pt.vf-host.com/upload_files/client_id_1/website_id_1/noticias/2017/pra%c3%a7a%20marqu%c3%aas%20de%20pombal_vrsa_dr_cm%20vrsa.jpg ) [ nicer ] ( http://cms.cm-vrsa.pt.vf-host.com/upload_files/client_id_1/website_id_1/slideshow/2016/slide-cmvrsa-iru.png ) than that first picture shows . 
   furthermore , iirc state security ( pide ) agents shot at a mob which formed around pide 's headquarters in rua do carmo . 
  small correction : pide 's headquearters were at rua ant\u00f3nio maria cardoso . 
  but indeed , 4 people died when pide 's agents shot fire at the mob . 
  [ there 's a plaque with their names on the building . 
  ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fegnbmj3pk4/teoyzwnv84i/aaaaaaaabpi/kz1j9_xwuf0/s1600/rua+amc.jpg ), 
  i was also expecting the event to gather a lot more money , but honestly , any help at all is probably welcomed . 
  at least , it might cover the most immediate expenses for those who lost everything ( clothing , food , health expenses , basic repairs and so on ) . 
  we 're like that with everyone , actually . 
  glad you had a good experience , though . 
  santamaria , how i could i forget them ? 
  give oliven\u00e7a back and we 'll let you have a bit of this wonderful atlantic breeze . 
  did portugal even ever got into the eurodance train ? 
  i ca n't think of a single song . 
  in fact , salazar died thinking he was still the president . 
  no one had the heart to tell him he had been replaced . 
  all the bacalhau would be ours .
