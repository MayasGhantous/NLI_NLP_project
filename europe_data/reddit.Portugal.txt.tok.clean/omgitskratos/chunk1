  this goes down on reddit history books . 
  as someone who was born and raised in porto and has travelled to a fair amount of countries within europe , i must say i feel like porto and lisbon ( or portugal as a whole ) are * really * underrated by people who want to go abroad . 
  edit : but only by people who * have n't * visited yet . 
  sell your tickets and go to belarus . 
  i heard it 's much nicer there . 
  ~ ~ this year was my last year in high school and i did n't actually have the same timetable as the other portuguese posting here ( maybe he 's from a private school ? 
  ) . ~ ~ ~ ~ well , i would normally only have classes all morning or all afternoon . ~ ~ ~ ~ - all morning classes : start 8h25 , end 13h25 ( 3 classes ) . ~ ~ ~ ~ - all afternoon classes : start 13h40 , end 16h55/18h40 ( 2/3 classes ) . ~ ~ i had 90 minutes classes with 15min recess between each of them . 
  ** edit ** : before high school : start at ~ 9am , lunch break was shorter and i would have classes until ~ 17h , i think . 
  ** edit 2 ** : i begin to realise that / r/rebur was correct . 
  if i had all day classes ( which was maybe once a week ) , it would go from 8h25 to 18h40 . 
  but normally it would be from 8h25 to 16h55 . 
  as you progressed through the years , you 'd have less classes and start to have only all morning classes or all afternoon classes : 8h25-13h25 ( all morning ) , 13h40-18h40 ( all afternoon ) . 
  ** edit 3 : lunch breaks ( in high schol ) were from 13h25 to 15h25 - so yeah , 2 hours . 
  ** to take this into context , most people would either go eat at home ( like me ) or they would eat at the cafeteria or nearby cheap bars/restaurants . 
  for the people who would eat at the school cafeteria 2 hours was too much , but for people who would eat at home ( most of them , i 'd say ) , it was fair . 
  thank you for proving my point . 
   did you honestly just imply that german , brazilian , spanish & french fans do n't shit talk over soccer ? 
  no , i did n't imply that . 
  i just meant that despite having better teams , they do n't view themselves as the best in the world .

  it 's not about that , i actually think we should n't make it out of group stage . 
  not with this lack of quality , anyway . 
   if i went on a portugese majority website the fact that you ca n't even spell `` portuguese '' correctly says a lot . 
  considering it 's a small subreddit , it 's not nice . 
  and even if it was n't , it 's just something disrespectful . 
  even more so considering that the us is n't even that good at the sport . 
  you could look at germany , brazil , spain ( well not in this wc ) , even france - who are some of the best teams in the world - and question why they do n't feel the need to say they 're the best . 
  i was kidding . 
  ^ ^ ^ damn ^ ^ ^ spaniards ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ any ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ jokes, 
   as now even a portuguese mechanic can easily work in a polish tank i feel slightly offended . ^ ^ ^ damn ^ ^ ^ spaniards, 
  you should really try to enhance your `` mildly humorous '' comments , as at least 7 people did n't get it . 
  i respect that . 
  but why do you feel the need to post that on a comment ? 
  it does n't contribute at all to this discussion . 
  i guess so . 
  that 's one of the reasons i would n't be a very good politian , i guess . 
  i also did something along those lines for geography class . 
  i picked macedonia for some reason - or maybe i was assigned that country , i really do n't recall . 
  althought it 's not an eu member state , i still remember the macedonian flag and talking about skopje , for example . 
  although i do n't really concur with the first bit , that last part is an interesting idea - i must say . 
   as we 've been fighting one european country or another for thousands of years until very recently . 
  pardon me , but i really do n't understand this argument . 
  sure , the uk is not the most pro-eu country in the world but , following your train of thought , portugal would n't be pro-eu just because we fought the spaniards , the dutch ( in the discoveries ) , we participated in ww1 , etc. 
  oh , and because we fought other eu countries ( in a sense ) as we wanted to keep our african colonies despite all other europeans countries had already given them independence . 
  i 'm always really astonished , though , everytime i hear brits calling europe `` they '' and not `` us '' . 
   well , i did n't meant `` intensity '' like that , i meant more if you studied it with a particular detail . 
  yes , we did in fact study the end of the iberian union with detail - it was a very important date in our history ( both portuguese and spanish history ) . 
  when i hear `` restaura\u00e7\u00e3o da independ\u00eancia '' i always remember the three filipes ( the spanish kings ) , the amount of years they ruled ( 60 ) , the lack of a legitimate portuguese sucessor to the throne , d. jo\u00e3o iv in [ this ] ( http://files.antigo-regime.webnode.pt/200000069-8a5508b4e4/12-1.jpg ) image for example . 
   i can tell you many spaniards wish they had concentrated in portugal ahah , that 's funny . 
  i really did n't want portugal to be just another region under spanish rule , but i do think we 'd have a pretty good football team , though . 
   history should be about understanding relationships and principles by example , applied anthropology so to speak , not about memorising dates . 
  sure , but that was n't what i talked about in the previous comment . 
  the thing that my teacher declined to be part of were those `` what if ? '', 
  i mean , when teaching/studying history , i 've always been taught that there is no place for speculations - that 's all . 
  like : what if the allies had lost ww2 ? 
  what if catalunya had stayed an independent country like portugal did ? 
  what if africa had not been colonised by european countries ? 
  you 're not supposed to be sorry . 
  you 're free to have your own opinion and i get what you 're saying , i really do . 
  i , myself , feel a lot more portuguese than i feel european , although i 'm pro-europe and would like to see a federalised europe one day . 
  exactly because we 're part of the solar system and that involves planets from all over the world . 
  you clearly missed the `` inter-planetary community '' point of the post and that it was the wold thing behind this idea . 
  care to keep going ? 
  we basically talk about important revolutions ( e.g. 
  the french revolution or the industrial revolution ) , the world wars , as well as the roman and the greek . 
   but not to create ` european identity ' - we are diverse and let it stay like that * in varietate concordia * , i guess . 
  i guess you 're right in a sense . 
  while valuing this idea of a `` european feeling '' , i do also think that - as different , individual countries - we should help each other and work together towards a cause . 
  i think i already answered this somewhere in the comments . 
  it may be because i 'm probably from a different country , but i do not feel that we only talked about glory when we studied portuguese history . 
  there were many times when we criticised out country , especially economically-wise ( it goes back the alliance with the english in 1386 , for example ) and during our dictatorship that ended 40 years ago . 
  edit :  i get what you 're saying but i disagree . 
   when i was maybe on the 8th grade , we were discussing the `` share of africa '' and we came to when the portuguese proposed the union of angola , mozambique and the territories between those colonies ( we called it the pink map ) . 
  while every other european country accepted the idea , the british opposed and gave us an ultimatum to leave the lands under dispute ( they wanted to colonise from cape to cairo ) and , as a result , the portuguese backed out of the deal . 
   i , then , asked my teacher if the british would really attack us considering we had been allies for a lot of centuries before that and if not insisting on keeping those territories was a good decision for us ( the so-famous `` what if '' ) . 
  my teacher answered me that we are required to learn about what really happened and not what could 've happened if things went through a different pass . 
  so : we wanted those lands , the british gave us an ultimatum , we backed off . 
  period . 
  brussels ? 
  you 're probably right on that that 's why i said `` i 'm not so sure about how those european history classes would be put into practice . 
  it 's probably an unrealistic propostion but it all started with this silly idea that people from the eu should know at least the bare minimum about other countries within the union '' . 
   it was merely a thought that came to me at 6 in the morning - so please , bare with me . 
  i 'm not so sure about how those european history classes would be put into practice . 
  it 's probably an unrealistic propostion but it all started with this silly idea that people from the eu should know at least the bare minimum about other countries within the union - and , despite disagreeing with the european history class stuff - we can all agree on this , right ? 
  this is probably the wisest comment here , especially the last part . 
  i think that 's a good point . 
  ironically enough , though , and going along what i said in the original post , i do n't know much about swiss history to be sure . 
  i 'm not talking about an albanian kid learning about the siege of lisbon . 
  i 'm talking about him learning that the portuguese were the first to initiate the discoveries , for example . 
  or maybe a estonian kid learning about the iberian reconquista . 
  you have a different view on the topic and that 's alright . 
  ~ ~ although , you should maybe try to emphasize that the fact that you think this a terrible idea is your opinion and not that the idea itself is , in fact , terrible ~ ~ ( you actually did in your first comment , sorry ) . 
  also , read edit number two . 
  exactly because we 're all part of a union which happens to be european and that involves several other european countries . 
  you clearly missed the `` european feeling '' point of this post and that it was the whole thing behind this idea . 
  i get what you 're saying but i disagree . 
  when i was maybe on the 8th grade , we were discussing the `` share of africa '' and we came to when the portuguese proposed the union of angola , mozambique and the territories between those colonies ( we called it the pink map ) .
