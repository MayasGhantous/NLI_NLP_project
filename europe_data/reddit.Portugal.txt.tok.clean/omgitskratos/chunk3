   touch without warning i ca n't really relate to this . 
  only if you 're referring to our habit of kissing as a form of greeting - only between two women or a man and a woman , though ; never between two men ( unless they 're like father/son ) . 
  can confirm , i 'm from portugal and we 're the same, 
  not in spain/portugal at least . 
  i 'm portuguese and have no clue about what he 's talking about . 
  ahah good one :p, 
  as long as those pesky spaniards do n't bother us , it 's all good . 
  first and foremost , thanks for sharing your point of view - it really means a lot to me . 
  and yes , although you 're totally right about the weather conditions here in europe i think i can handle that pretty well . 
  i 've visited most northern/western europe ( except scandinavia ) and the weather is definitely not the same as here in portugal , in the iberian peninsula or even southern europe in general . 
  of course , there 's a lot of small things i will have to get used to , a lot of homesickness - we , in portuguese , have a little word that describes this feeling and has no translation to any other language ( including english ) : * saudade * . 
  but i 'd definitely rather have a little * saudade * for a couple of months than , in the future , looking back at the things i could 've done if i had the guts to do them at that time . 
  this version is awesome !, 
  although the one i transcribed - the one we had in portugal - was the spanish one with portuguese subtitles . 
  ahahah yes , completely true, 
  can confirm . 
  i went to netherlands this summer and after a week of reading stuff on the streets of amsterdam i began to think that if i 'd smash my head on a keyboard i would most likely get a word in dutch ... let 's try it : smashing my head on the keyboard in 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... * gemeenschappelijk * this means `` common '' in english . 
  see ? 
  i was right . 
  thanks for the response . 
  copenhagen is indeed a tempting option . 
  although one thing i do n't really understand is that the admission deadline ends in march for the it university of copenhagen and , for example , in sweden it 's on the 15th january ( both deadlines are for the winter/autumn semester of 2014 ) . 
  the thing is : how am i able to apply for a bsc if i have n't even finished high school then ? 
  thanks a lot . 
  these types of websites are so incredibly helpful for someone in my position . 
  but of course , if i had to learn a different language from the ones i know now , french would probably be one of the easiest as i 'm already familiar with it . 
  i did n't mean that french was n't relevant as a language because it is one the most important languages in europe . 
  had i studied more thouroughly french and i would have much more opportunities right now . 
  it 's just that i know very little french which would n't help me that much . 
  thanks for the website by the way , i had come up with sort of a swedish version of this and it was really helpful . 
  thanks for the response . 
  i 've been to scotland and loved it , to be fair . 
  went to glasgow , edinburgh and another small city i 'm currently not recalling . 
  it would be really good for me to move to scotland as i speak the native language fluently , of course - something that does n't happen in other european countries . 
  by the way , how can i have access to other courses that are offered in scotland , for example ? 
  and perhaps more importantly , how can i have have access to the grades that i have to have in order to be accepted in those said courses ? 
  thanks for the response . 
  i 'm fluent in english , spanish and portuguese ( i also know a tiny bit of french but that is n't relevant , in my opinion ) . 
  i thought that in scandinavia i would do just fine with only english . 
  or even if i decide to graduate there - which should n't be a problem as english is the main language in those said it courses - maybe those 4 years would be enough for me to learn the language . 
  thanks for the response , i really appreciate it . 
  firstly and regarding the language barriers , let 's just say i 'm perfectly capable of speaking english on daily basis - i 've been to several european countries ( including english-speaking ) and i have no problems on that matter . 
  other than that , i can speak spanish quite fluently , portuguese and a tiny bit of french - which is n't that relevant . 
  secondly , how can i have access to other courses that are offered in those countries ? 
  and perhaps more importantly , how can i have have access to the grades i have to have in order to enter those said courses ?

  * ( sorry for copying and pasting this bit from a previous answer but i have a class in a bit and need to hurry ) * secondly , the scandinavia is indeed a preferred place and the kth seems to be a really good fit . 
  i 'm , however , clueless about what grades you must have to be accepted on that university - is there any way i can have access to this type of information ? 
  on a last note , in terms of housing and daily costs , it 's not that relevant compared to other aspects . 
  sure , sweden - as do other north european countries - has a high standard of living but i 'm fortunate enough to have my parents ' support and also to managed to save some money through jobs i did over the last few months/years . 
  p.s. - i just realised i have n't answered your first question . 
  i am currently considering either enrolling on a bsc abroad and then perhaps work abroad after that or maybe a bsc here in portugal and then a msc abroad afterwards . 
  i 'm currently leaning towards the first option which is the most tricky as well . 
  this is also a possibility . 
  one that came up recently and that is bugging me ever since . 
  the thing is that i do n't even know what i should do . 
  if i should start looking for unis in the it department in europe and see if i 'd fit ... 
  i mean i do n't even know the grades you have to have in order to enter a specific university . 
  all i know is that i must get a certificate that would verify my qualifications and make sure they 're suitable not only for portugal but for the rest of the eu . 
  is anyone able to give any help/inside on this matter ? 
  this is going to be a completely different answer from all the ones that are in this post - so bare with me please . 
  but anyway , when i was little , there was a kids tv show called `` doraemon '' which was hugely popular here in portugal and was also dubbed in spanish with portuguese subtitles ( for some reason ) . 
  nowadays , i still know the exact lyrics to this show 's theme song . 
  [ right now i even cried little tears of joy when i was listening to the song on youtube . 
  i 'm sure every portuguese kid my age can relate to this . 
  this is so magical . 
  * oh memories ... * edit : other from that i really like spaniards . 
  they 're * nuestros hermanos * ( our brothers ) and even though they were big cunts when they ruled our country for 60 ( yes , sixty ! ), 
  years , i still love them as my own . 
  okay , maybe not during football euro or world cups - but other from that , they 're cool . 
  i 'm gon na go on a limb here and say that i would n't find any place on earth that managed to be as beautiful and with as good food as portugal . 
  i really love my country . 
  but yeah , for this post 's sake , i would say ** spain ** , ** italy ** , or ** the netherlands ** . 
  from all the fifteen countries i visited in europe , these are the ones i find the most interesting and that suit me better . 
  [ better resolution ] ( http://www.radicalcartography.net/discoveries.png ), 
  going to paris , brussels , cologne and amsterdam . 
  i think i 'll stick with english xd, 
  i 'm going to brussels in a week but as it is a bilingual territory i really do n't know what language to speak . 
  i mean , i do n't know any dutch but me and my mom can speak a bit of french . 
  i guess i 'll just speak english :d, 
  that 's awesome . 
  i find the name `` magellan '' hilarious , though - it 's supposed to be the translation of `` magalh\u00e3es '' . 
  we only dub animation films ( like monsters inc. , toy story or something like that . 
  we find it hilarious when we go to spain and watch films dubbed in spanish . 
  thiago alcantara even quoted pessoa in his goodbye letter, 
  here in portugal it 's safe to say that we have good internet connections then ( only in the big cities on the coast , though - i 'm from oporto btw ) . 
  i myself was paying 60 $ for 60mbit ( w / unlimited downloads ) + tv ( almost 160 channels ) with pause/restart and whatever + home phone ( w / no limited number of phone calls , if that 's a thing ) . 
  a couple of months ago they upgraded my connection to 120mbit with no further expenses . 
  i love those guys . 
  edit 1 : now i was even offered 15 $ every month to use in the company 's movie library . 
  edit 2 : for all the portuguese out there yeah , i have a contract with zon , not with meo . 
  that 's why . 
  edit 3 : [speedtest.net link of my connection ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/2820799385 ), 
  i like how in the iberian peninsula almost all the coast is lit up . 
  and then there 's madrid right in the center . 
  in portugal the two things occur : surnames can either have its origin connected with something related with nature ( toponymics , names of trees , or geographics ) , or they can simply be originated from a popular first name ( usually the father 's ) . 
  take a look : * ** silva ** ( from `` selva '' ( later , `` silva '' ) or `` floresta '' = forest , woods ) * *** santos *** * ( = saints - religious origin ; an exception to the rule ) * * ** pereira ** ( = pear tree ) * ** rodrigues ** ( = son of `` rodrigo '' ) * ** costa ** ( = coast , toponymic origin - family who used to lived near the coast ) * ** oliveira ** ( = olive tree ) * ** martins ** ( = son of `` martim '' ) * ** sousa ** ( geographic origin ( river in the north of portugal ) - you can find more about this , [ here ] ( http://www.bit.ly/xty6gi ) ) * ** gon\u00e7alves ** ( = son of `` gon\u00e7alo '' ), 
  other from our [ national anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouvzjqlwpte ) , [ gr\u00e2ndola vila morena ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci76ckwflds ) ( from jos\u00e9 ` zeca ' afonso ) is also a famous song within our people .
