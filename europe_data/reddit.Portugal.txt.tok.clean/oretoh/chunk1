thank god really , i honestly rather not have a single refugee in here . 
  no but my country does not have a shitton of states that can have different values . 
  yep and then we will have an ukranian hymn ... or any other country that russia decides to attack next that will come to eurovision to make a sad song about it . 
  in public they will congratulate him . 
  in private they probably facepalmed themselves so hard they actually need 2 tons of makeup to go and congratulate trump . 
  honestly , between trump and putin , i think i would rather have some politics veteran pulling the usa 's strings ... at least they wo n't use nukes ... for now . 
  guessing mother nature got tired of always using the same boot ? 
  i mean it 's quite obvious that if you want to leave , you leave , you do n't just take the rights the same way you 've been doing . 
  it would be nice if i could properly hear it without that huge fucking beeping !, 
  wait ... portugal ?? 
  ^ spotted the typical voter , how you guys failed to see brexit was going to take a major hit at uk is beyond me ... 
  i 'll say it , some italians should make a funny cartoon out of it , ya know , an eye for an eye . 
  no , i 'm calling them idiots because they willingly made their own lifes worse . 
  you mean ... 52 % of the population are not idiots ? 
  honestly if you voted `` leave '' while you 're in the uk , getting more benefits than demands then you 're an idiot . 
  because it was not their obligation to . 
  on the other hand you ( not you in particular , the whole `` leave '' party of your country ) should 've checked your benefits before voting `` leave '' . 
  idiots like you are the reason the pound is falling , just in case you have n't noticed yet . 
  aye someone 's got ta pay dem nukes and it ai n't gon na be putin !, 
  good , let them kill each other . 
  two birds , one stone . 
  that 's because in most european countries every random nutjob ca n't really get a gun easily . 
  not really a matter of how the police reacts more like country policies . 
  notice the word stabbed . 
  if the suspect had a gun i 'm sure the shot would n't have been in a leg . 
  can you people stop and think a bit before you start rambling random nonsense ? 
  the fuck !, 
  that 140,000 $ income based fine better be applied only to some millionaire going 200kph above the speed limit . 
  thousands for speeding ? 
  what are you drunk on so early in the morning ? 
  vieram roubar-nos as terras !!!, 
  it 's not like we know your pm either ... i mean you 've been having so many recently . 
  first the sports reports , then the eiffel tower 's flag colors , the news and now they send a kid to interview the president of another country which he does n't recognize . 
  i 'd say the french just keep embarrassing themselves more and more . 
  president of pornography presenting for duty , i will make porn great again !, 
  funny that you would say that disclaimer , since i 'm using 3 ad blockers and nothing blocking me appears hehe . 
  so you do n't know what privacy is ? 
  i guess you would n't mind your naked childhood photos all over the internet . 
  you would n't mind having one or two pedos fapping to your baby photos would ya ? 
  what does that have anything to do with this news ? 
  are n't you just bashing people for having money ? 
  i think an appropriate answer to this charlie hebdo issue should be the following : take a few italians to nice , get them a truck , get them pillows and red paint , place red painted pillows in front of truck and then proceed to ride over them while playing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4vmvwd24c ) . 
  i 'm sure everyone would find this * hilarious * . 
  `` losing his job '' i 'm pretty sure he said `` fuck it , you created this mess now you deal with it . '', 
  got a problem with being threatened ? 
  whatcha gon na do bout it brah ? 
  oh ... wait i 'm not spanish why am i even here ? 
  so many downvotes for people that do n't actually support this shit of a `` tradition '' . 
  shame on you redditors i actually thought this sub was better than that . 
  `` you 're expected '' , the only expectation i have of people is to not kill/hurt physically other people , i mean it 's not that hard and i 'm sure that if you actually bothered to talk with the people you know they would n't give a crap about whether you breed or not . 
  if , in fact , people do expect that from you , here 's a tip : you should n't hang out with people that stress you out . 
  oh right i forgot canada exists , sorry apple syruppers . 
  but honestly , with their new pm i do n't think things will remain this nice for canadians much longer , maybe it 's because i do n't really like the guy but i have a bad feeling . 
  err i 'm portuguese not italian buddy . 
  hey at least we did n't lose two world wars so we 're doing pretty good probability wise . 
  screw you guys , next world war will be started by greece and portugal and after that we 'll see who comes out on top !, 
  i think there 's an epidemic with english speaking countries . 
  apparently they have been losing a lot of things nowadays . 
  you 're the one trying to present studies without giving a source . 
  you 're trying to pass facts without anything to back them . 
  i did find some articles like [ this ] ( http://time.com/money/4285838/money-can-buy-happiness-study/ ) that leads to [ this ] ( http://time.com/money/2802147/does-money-buy-happiness/ ) but most of them only mention income money growth by which i mean for example 75k/year to 100k/year they never mention millionaires that can get to incomes like more than 10m/year . 
  now if you want to prove me wrong state your sources , else you can stick your insults in your place where the sun does n't shine . 
  yeah , well , then i guess studies do n't apply to me . 
  either way i doubt those that made that study had any decent chance to talk to several millionaires but if you say so . 
  with 100k/year you ca n't buy 90 % of the things you would really want , in my case i would love a yacht but the price + maintenance would go way beyond my paycheck . 
  heh , i mean if we 're talking about an income of around 100k/year then yes money does n't buy you happiness but if you happen to win euromillions jackpot of 100m , well , as the saying goes around the internet , i never saw a sad person on a jetsky . 
  * sigh * your lack of ability to analyze sources is starting to annoy me , really . 
  i will just give you this one more thing . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_london ) 's the ethnic groups in london by location . 
  now compare the ethnic areas on those maps with the mp report i gave you earlier and see how they check out . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_london http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/ http://www.numbeo.com/crime/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016-mid&amp;region=150 london at 17th place in europe , birmingham at 6th . 
  what areas ? 
  london has many areas and the ones that are being cautioned about are areas where mainly ethnics population live at . 
  also as someone who lived in london for about 4 months i 'm pretty sure london is a lot more dangerous than lisbon specially when it comes to getting assaulted for being in the wrong `` neighborhood '' . 
  i said not sure about indians , i did n't exclude anyone . 
  i mean , if it 's true ( when it comes to areas populated by blacks/pakistanis not sure about indians ) there is no reason not to be advised about . 
  * sigh * once again , portugal does n't even reach the top 30 . 
  i like to think the owners of those doom bringers would choose not to use them . 
  history might say otherwise but still ... 
  oh no but the eu was already trying to force the british leave , but of course they made it so it 'll take a while . 
  in time i doubt that without and economic and social alliance the countries would stick together like they are now and then it 'll just take a few bad apples to completely fuck this whole thing . 
  oh and i 'm sure nato would remain just fine if all the eu 's countries decided to be on bad terms with each other . 
  if you think the eu disbandment would n't lead to an eventual world war you 're more naive than the average voter and the average voter is pretty dang dumb, 
  end of the world ! = wwiii, 
  if she actually gets to power and the referendum ends up as the brexit ill just say `` fuck it , humanity is doomed i 'll move to my basement and wait for wwiii '', 
  did you know he ran 27 marathons in 27 days earlier this year ? 
  by the way the isis part was a joke ... i think . 
  i always wonder why the fuck people choose to make relations between countries worse than they already are . 
  just light up the stupid monumento , either way it wo n't make a difference but the people of russia will appreciate it . 
  fucking scrubs think things like this do not matter when it comes to country relations , they expect them to be `` rational '' the problem is , rationality is a lot easier when the whole country does n't feel like they are treated as second class by the other country . 
  it wo n't grant you any advantage either way . 
  no one is going to assume you 're `` more free '' because you wear it . 
  can you try to at least formulate an argument without saying `` lots of examples '' or `` generalized '' . 
  you know , an actual argument . 
  it contradicts your point because if it 's a tool for liberation why wo n't other women wear it too ? 
  you are not frequently talking with muslim girls . 
  in fact you probably only hear of muslims in the news . 
  so get out more and you might find that most of these ladies do wear this because of one of two reasons : * they spent most of their lives with the blankets as mandatory wear and now they feel naked/unprotected without them . 
  * what / u/x9t72 said about the families/friends shunning them if they do n't wear it . 
  usa bombs middle-east , the same way the un does .
