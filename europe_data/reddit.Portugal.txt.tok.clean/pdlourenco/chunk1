not sure whether you mistook slovenia for slovakia or you did that on purpose :p, 
  actually `` feira '' probably comes from the ecclesiastical latin word for [ day ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/segunda-feira ) , and not from market . 
  it does n't have to be recognized by every country , just by the two ( or more ) involved in the matter . 
  not saying that it is feasible , just that it is less impossible than an international court recognized everywhere . 
  edit : i forgot to say that this would require that the diplomatic immunity treaty specified that both involved countries had to agree in selecting a neutral court , in the case where they did not agree to allow prosecution at the host or at the sending country . 
  not trying to excuse my countrymen , but i guess it is much more common to have austrian tourists than aussies here , which could lead to that confusion . 
   if you search portuguese are ... in portuguese you will be also returned racists . 
  yeah , i know , my edit says just that . 
   google does n't separate countries , the results are for sure being caused by searches originated in brazil . 
  did n't think of that !, 
  yeah , it seems so . 
  but , then again , i just tried searching `` x are '' for a bunch of western european countries and for most of them the first search was either `` x are racists '' or `` x are arrogant '' . 
  so , nobody likes us , but we call everybody racist/arrogant . 
  that 's fair , i guess :p ps : everything changes when i search for the female version of x , then all are beautiful or gorgeous , except the british . 
  edit : i just typed `` the portuguese are '' and it seems that for our own search engine we are rude and also racists , and our women are dumb , beautiful , but also ugly . 
  i never liked or voted for him , but i really think that he is the president we needed right now . 
  he 's really close to the people , in opposition to the very strict `` mummy '' we had before , and he just knows how to empathize with the public . 
  i remember when there were big fires in madeira and he immediately flew there to be with the people who lost everything . 
  [ this is a strong image ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qqcteh-t47q/v629k-tj-oi/aaaaaaab4fo/lg-tzua2nremj2xucststgd7pdpegtewwclcb/s1600/538755.png ) from that time . 
  i do n't care whether it is a pr stunt or something real , the image he 's projecting is one of spontaneity , sincerity and care which is what people needed there . 
  it 's very similar , though set\u00fabal does have the lowest registered temperatures and the lowest average low of the two . 
  the thing is that the cold weather in set\u00fabal is much more humid than in alentejo . 
  the real perceived cold/heat depends a lot on humidity . 
  i beg to differ ( unfortunately ) . 
  a couple of sources ( in portuguese ) : http://rr.sapo.pt/noticia/75753/portugal_continental_tem_situacao_de_seca_em_98 https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/pais/barragens-a-sul-estao-abaixo-do-nivel-medio-para-a-epoca-do-ano_a985515, 
  brisa is from madeira , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  this lady seems to agree with you :p https://www.twitter.com/jonkay01/status/854300093142511621/video/1, 
  no , * lulas * or squids are used to make calamari . 
  choco is cuttlefish , but i do n't think it is eaten as often in other countries as it is here . 
  well , in all fairness you did make a mistake :p ( too vs to ), 
  we 'd be in the second cauldron . 
  we would complain all the time about it , but the second a passing imp criticized it we would defend the big qualities of our cauldron to death . 
  if , by any chance , someone escaped we would praise him when speaking with people from other cauldrons , but piss on him within ourselves . 
   they average about 1 % of the total votes every election not even that , fortunately . 
  their [ best ] ( http://www.eleicoes.mai.gov.pt/legislativas2015/ ) result was 27k votes , which is about 0.5 % . 
  they 're not just illegal , in fact they 're forbidden by the constitution . 
  edit : there 's an article forbidding armed or ( para ) military associations and racist/fascist organizations . 
  there 's another article stating that an mp will lose his mandate if he takes part in racist/fascist organizations . 
  yeah , pretty much this . 
  there was a thread here about patriotism/nationalism that sparked some discussion . 
  i liked [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/57lhg5/would_you_say_youre_very_patriotic/d8szp0q/ ) answer , i think it is an interesting view of what it may mean . 
  we do n't differentiate between maternal or paternal relatives . 
  in fact , we do n't even have a special word for the group ( like parents , grandparents ) !, 
  it 's actually funny , because our word for parents ( * pais * ) also means fathers ( and it is a masculine word ) and our word for grandparents ( * av\u00f3s * ) also means grandmothers ( here it 's the gender that differentiates , * os av\u00f3s * is the grandparents and * as av\u00f3s * is the grandmothers ) . 
  there was a thread about this a while ago [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/55trqt/europeans_what_idioms_referring_to_other/ ) . 
  lots of interesting answers !, 
  feynman is such an interesting person , i 'm definitely going to read that one whenever i get hold of it . 
  thanks for the short review !, 
  around 40 books per year . 
  i finally got around to reading war and peace , and i 'm really glad i did . 
  absolute pure bliss . 
  i 've been meaning to buy one of feynman 's books , what do you think of that one ? 
  edit : happy cakeday !, 
  there were settlements here since the neolithic . 
  later it was a celtic port named caetobriga before the roman invasion , and afterwards it was very much developed by the romans , with fish salting and ceramic factories . 
  during moorish occupation it pretty much disappeared , and only after the * reconquista * was the municipality of set\u00fabal properly reestablished in the 13th century . 
  well , there are lots of blog posts about our idioms , so here 's one that translates some idioms and tries to explain them : https://matadornetwork.com/notebook/20-funniest-portuguese-expressions-use/, 
   you are here you are there put yourself at stick !, 
  we have that one too : `` desenmerda-te '' even though we use more `` desenrasca-te '' which could be translated to `` take yourself out of the mess you 're in '' . 
  there was a post here some time ago about this : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5kwycj/portuguese_of_reddit_how_is_the_second_republic/, 
  i ca n't say just one dish , i 'll have to divide it in seafood , meat or bacalhau ( codfish is so special for us that i ca n't bundle it with anything else :p ) : ** seafood ** : * [ salmonetes com molho de f\u00edgados ] ( http://cdn.mytaste.org/i?u=http%3a%2f%2f1.fotos.web.sapo.io%2fi%2fg0a048c2d%2f19396166_seiyd.jpeg&amp;w=1200&amp;h=628&amp;c=1 ) * or red mullet with a sauce made with its own liver | * [ polvo \u00e0 lagareiro ] ( https://www.pingodoce.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/617_polvo.jpg ) * or roasted octopus and potatoes with lots of olive oil ( * lagar * is the place where olive oil is made ) ** meat ** : * [ arroz de cabidela ] ( http://www.petiscos.com/fotos_utilizadores/113cc66c849c5b1f028704d20a9e62ad6_cabidela_galinha.jpg ) * or blood rice with chicken and of course ** bacalhau ** : * [ bacalhau \u00e0 gomes de s\u00e1 ] ( http://gastronomiaefotografia.com.br/br/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/110.jpg ) * or baked codfish with potatoes , boiled eggs , a kind of onion stew and lots of olive oil, 
  we do . 
  near my place ( in a rural area ) there 's at least one crossing with sensors like that . 
  i always have problems with that when i 'm on my bicycle , because all the other traffic lights turn green and red and mine does n't change from red if i 'm there alone . 
  i do n't know if that 's the real reason , but it makes a lot of sense !, 
  actually the translation is even more absurd . 
  it translates directly to `` i am [ here ] '' , some people even say `` estou sim '' , which would translate to `` yes , i am [ here ] '' . 
  never quite understood why we do it . 
  thanks !, 
  it may look strange sometimes ( this is certainly a case :p ) , but i like when languages adapt foreign concepts into their own writing system . 
  young portuguese tend to do the exact opposite , use english words when there are perfectly good portuguese synonyms . 
   en la viqui a bit off-topic , but ... is `` viqui '' your word for `` wiki '' ? 
   who does n't wan na vote will just invalidate his vote sheet anyway . 
  yes , but then you can actually draw political conclusions from those numbers . 
  it 's very different to have 40 % abstentions and 3/4 % of blank/void votes or 40 % blank/void votes . 
  in the former , the politicians dismiss the abstentionists as lazy , and the blanks as not really significant protest votes . 
  in the latter case , they can not do that anymore . 
  not saying that i 'd agree with compulsory voting per se , but i might if there were political consequences from blank votes , say , above a certain percentage elections would have to be redone , or even having vacant seats in parliament according to blank votes . 
  our borders last changed in 1999 when we gave macau back to the chinese . 
  before that , it was 1974/1975 with the independence of east timor , and all the african territories ; 1961 with the annexation of goa back to india ; 1825 with the official independence of brazil and 1801 with the occupation of oliven\u00e7a by spain , which is still currently disputed ( our only active dispute ) . 
  it 's hard to choose one song , but [ cento mani , cento occhi ] ( https://youtu.be/wnl_7vxutbo ) is one of my favourites . 
  in fact , the whole album is extraordinary . 
  these are my three dogs : [ plut\u00e3o ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aoamdt9.jpg ) , a sweet but very territorial [ portuguese mastiff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rafeiro_do_alentejo ) , [ pit\u00e1goras ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o48jinh.jpg ) , his half-brother , a mix of labrador and portuguese mastiff , and [ pipas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wnjlilw.jpg ) , the elder . 
  this photo is more than 6 years old , he 's getting old now but still going !, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.visitsetubal.com.pt/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/baia-de-setubal.jpg ) 's a view of set\u00fabal , portugal . 
  this is taken from the xvi century city fort , and is one of my favorite views from the city . 
  the city is bordered by a series of mountains as well as by the river/ocean , so there are some very nice sea views and beaches nearby . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.fotosantesedepois.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3890249025_3cb8156f19_b.jpg ) is a view of a very small village just 10km away . 
  people call it maced\u00f3nia ( the c is soft ) . 
  officially it is called rep\u00fablica da maced\u00f3nia or antiga rep\u00fablica jugoslava da maced\u00f3nia ( direct translation from fyrom ) . 
  the ancient greek region has the exact same name , we do n't differentiate as the germans do , for example . 
  in portuguese there are several adjectives which meanings have completely changed in the last century , but can still be used in their original meaning . 
  for instance , * brutal * which meant originally the same as the english word , now also means something that is awesome ( it 's mostly used by young people ) . 
  the word * bestial * has followed the same road : while it originally meant something with the qualities of a beast ( as in english ) , now means something similar to amazing . 
  not many people use * bestial * in its original meaning , but * brutal * is still used both ways . 
  the verb * despoletar * that comes from the word * espoleta * or fuse in english , originally meant `` to remove the fuse '' or `` to disarm '' . 
  from bad use of the word , most people have come to use it for the complete opposite : `` to trigger '' . 
  in some contexts this can be somewhat confusing :p * manga * is mango ( the fruit ) , sleeve , and a form of the verb * mangar * - to joke with someone . 
  there are several other examples , especially with words used to describe nationalities that are synonyms to other things but they can be seen as a bit racist : * galego * is both galician and someone who is a workhorse , * judeu * is jew or someone cruel in a childish way , etc. . 
  spain ( lived there for a couple of months and visited two or three times for a couple of days each ) 2 .
