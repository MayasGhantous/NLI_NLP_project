  i think that estado novo is viewed with mixed feelings by the population . 
  it was a time of stability and economic recovery after the two very turbulent decades after the end of the monarchy . 
  i think most people recognize that salazar did a `` good '' job in the first couple of years by recovering the countries finances , but he did that at the expense of the people , which were quite poor . 
  after that , the regime got stronger and stronger with the creation of the state police and the restriction of most freedoms ( speech , association , etc. . . ) . 
  furthermore , he was an advocate of the `` proudly alone '' policy and that stopped the development of the country for almost 5 decades : the country was kept largely agricultural and the people were held back from developing themselves . 
  in the 1930s he initiated the state-backed construction of several much-needed infrastructures ( universities , the lisbon airport , roads , etc. . . ) to , `` allegedly '' , kickstart the growth of the country . 
  however , repression was and would still be very much an issue for the coming decades until after his death . 
  there were lots of political prisoners , and there was even an [ assassination of a presidential candidate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humberto_delgado#murder ) . 
  when marcello caetano came to power , in 1968 , the country was better than when the dictatorship started : economy was growing helped by the reforms and , perhaps , also the marshall plan ; and the widespread mandatory elementary schooling was starting to improve the education of the population . 
  so he initiated something that is called the `` marcellist spring '' with apparent political freedom ( elections were held in 1969 allowing for opposition to run , even if with zero chances of winning ) , social reforms ( pensions were introduced to the rural workers who had no social security ) , and new industrial investments ( the new refinery , and the greatest dam of the `` empire '' in mozambique ) . 
  so the now-growing bourgeoisie thought that this meant the political opening of the country . 
  however , this was somewhat a sham . 
  due to the colonial war that had been going on for over 10 years , due to the fact that the political establishment did not really want the political opening , and many other factors , there was continued discontent . 
  6 years later , there was the revolution . 
  all in all , some older people that were dumbed down by the regime and did n't rebel at the time/didn ' t have close relatives that were repressed look back with some nostalgia . 
  people that only remember caetano 's time also fit here , i think . 
  and , of course , do n't forget that the longing for older , most of the times erroneously deemed better , eras is something that is very deeply entrenched in portuguese culture . 
  younger people are able to distance themselves from that nostalgia and can see the estado novo for what it was : a dictatorship , less populist and extremist than others in europe , but still a terrible dictatorship that closed the country to industrial/agricultural/technological / societal development and repressed those that were against it . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the dictatorship stabilized the country , and , if you did n't rebel against the regime , you could live quietly . 
  people were far from rich , but had their families , their jobs , their religion . 
  a few old people long for these times and end up forgetting the bad things that happened . 
  younger people that lived through it see this period in far worse eyes . 
  younger people that did not live through it do n't think too much about it . 
  there 's also an important detail that some times is forgotten : portuguese people living in the colonies , which ended up returning after the revolution/independence , had a much less strict restriction of freedom than the people in european portugal at the time . 
  from what i hear from my maternal family , which lived in the rural part of portuguese angola for over 20 years , life there was hard but pretty good - the state police did n't have that much influence . 
  so while my father 's family recalls episodes of suppression here in the `` metropolis '' and does n't think that much of the era of dictatorship , my mother 's family tends to look to the `` days of yore '' as a time when life was simpler/safer/better and think of the revolution as something sweet and sour : it brought freedom to the people but `` robbed '' them of what they had there because when they came back the country was in a far worse economical/social shape then what they knew from the colonies . 
  thanks for the suggestions !, 
  i will definitely give them a try . 
  which books by walter moers would you recommend that have been translated to english ? 
  and also , would you consider his books very difficult for someone with almost b2 level in german ? 
  saramago is great , yeah !, 
  and there are a couple of newer authors that are very good too : valter hugo m\u00e3e , afonso cruz , within others . 
  i 'm glad that saramago is appreciated by nuestros hermanos , 
  my favourite portuguese author is [ e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_maria_de_e%c3%a7a_de_queir%c3%b3s ) , who introduced realism to the portuguese scene . 
  i really like his prose and love the social criticism that underlies most of his books . 
  in europe , i 'm going to have to go with tolkien , perhaps followed by dostoyevsky . 
  a good ginjinha is always welcome , yes , 
  fair enough , but i find it funny that people think my language is sexy . 
  especially when put together with italian :p, 
  any specific reason you 'd like to learn these two ? 
  definitely lusitania . 
  ( or perhaps ederland after our lord and saviour ), 
  yes , but the rule is not very strict . 
  people have every combination from 1 to 4 surnames , as long as the last one is from the father . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  i was just trying to explain the reasoning for full names . 
  most people use the second option i mentioned . 
  here in portugal the naming custom is slightly different . 
  the father 's surname ( s ) is/are always the last . 
  so a complete name would look something like this : < first name  < second given name  < first mother surname  < last mother surname  < first father surname  < last father surname  most people only pass their last surnames , so their children 's names would be < first name  < second given name  < last mother surname  < last father surname , 
  there are also some pretty funny ads from the time immediately after the revolution . 
  pinheiro de azevedo , a presidential candidate , used mostly comics and humor as his ads , for example [ this one ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yfsrn6qby4w/to8es4uicvi/aaaaaaaablc/zsxkvq27pvm/s400/m.jpg ) ( where he advocates `` pluralist and democratic freedom of speech '' and azevedo exclaims a curse word that expresses repulsion or dismissal - i ca n't find an equivalent in english ) . 
  til . 
  had no idea they were here . 
  you 're right , sorry !, 
   cuba and lagos in portugal named the lands outside portugal , not the other way around . 
  yes , i know . 
  that 's why i said exactly that :  ( well this one is probably the origin of the name of lagos , nigeria , and not the other way around ) , 
  we have places called [ cuba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuba,_portugal ) , calif\u00f3rnia ( this is a very small village in [ loul\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loul%c3%a9 ) , i could n't find anything in english ) , [ lagos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagos,_portugal ) ( well this one is probably the origin of the name of [ lagos , nigeria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagos#history ) , and not the other way around ) , [ bel\u00e9m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bel%c3%a9m_\\ ( lisbon \\ ) ) ( bethlehem ) , [ nazar\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazar%c3%a9,_portugal ) ( nazareth ) , and i 'm sure there are a few more . 
  we have very similar words for bride and groom , * noiva * and * noivo * , which is unsurprising given how similar our languages are in writing . 
  however , we do have separate words for boyfriend/girlfriend , * namorado/namorada * . 
  well said . 
  * venda das raparigas ( girl sale ) * cabr\u00f5es ( bastards/motherf * ckers ) * picha ( dick ) * quinta da comich\u00e3o ( itch farm ) * rabo de peixe ( fish tail ) * vila nova do coito ( new town of coitus ) * colo do pito ( chick ( as in small chicken ) lap , can also be p * ssy lap ) there are many others , but these are the ones i can remember out the top of my head . 
  thanks for reminding me of him . 
  just mentioning a few for each category going from the middle ages to current times : * poets and authors : [ luis de cam\u00f5es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lu%c3%ads_de_cam%c3%b5es ) ( wrote an [ epic poem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/os_lus%c3%adadas ) that greatly influenced the portuguese language , also known as the language of cam\u00f5es ) , [ fernando pessoa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_pessoa ) , [ e\u00e7a de queir\u00f3z ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_maria_de_e%c3%a7a_de_queir%c3%b3s ) ( major symbol of realism and great critic of the society of his time ) , [ jos\u00e9 saramago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_saramago ) ( nobel prize in literature ) * scientists and engineers : [ pedro nunes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_nunes ) ( great mathematician , invented the [ nonius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonius_\\ ( device \\ ) ) ) , [ egas moniz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_egas_moniz ) ( nobel prize in medicine , invented the lobotomy ) , [ ant\u00f3nio dam\u00e1sio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_damasio ) ( neuroscientist ) * generals and admirals : [ nuno \u00c1lvares pereira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuno_%c3%81lvares_pereira ) ( helped maintain the independence on a succession crisis with a major battle against castile ) , [ duarte pacheco pereira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duarte_pacheco_pereira ) ( this guy won the [ battle of cochin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cochin_\\ ( 1504 \\ ) ) where , along 100 portuguese , he fought an indian army of around 80k men by expert exploitation of the terrain , the tides , and the available equipment ) * navigators/explorers ( given our history , i feel like these should have their own category ) : [ henry the navigator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_the_navigator ) ( not really a navigator/explorer , but , as son of the king and administrator he helped start the age of discovery ) , [ pedro \u00c1lvares cabral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_%c3%81lvares_cabral ) ( brasil ) , [ diogo c\u00e3o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diogo_c%c3%a3o ) ( angola/congo ) , [ vasco da gama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasco_da_gama ) ( sea route to india ) , [ fern\u00e3o de magalh\u00e3es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_magellan ) ( circumnavigation of the earth ) , and many others . 
  more recently , [ sacadura cabral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_de_sacadura_cabral ) and [ gago coutinho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_viegas_gago_coutinho ) are honorable mentions ( first flight across the south atlantic and invention of several flight instruments based on sextants ) * philosophers ( i 'm not very knowledgeable on this area , maybe another countryman can contribute here ) : [ padre ant\u00f3nio vieira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ant%c3%b3nio_vieira ) , [ agostinho da silva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agostinho_da_silva ) * humanitarians : [ aristides de sousa mendes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aristides_de_sousa_mendes ) ( our own schindler , saved thousands of jews during wwii by issuing visas and passports to refugees against the explicit orders of the dictator , salazar ), 
   edit : to add all these , we have a word `` palavra '' which means `` bullshit , lies , bragging '' . 
  it also meant `` promise , i promise '' in portugese , and `` palabra '' had same meaning in spanish ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  i have read somewhere that ottoman sailors adopt this word while trading with spanish/portugese in mediterrenean who rarely kept their promises xd this is very interesting , even if demeaning for us :p you are quite correct , the main meaning of `` palavra '' and `` palabra '' is `` word '' , but they can be related to a promise , like in `` i give you my word that i will do something '' . 
    trabalhar como um galego ( work like a galician ) : work really hard  this one may be sarcastic ? 
  here the stereotype of galicians is being reeeeaaaallyyyy sloooooowwwww . 
  no , actually it is not sarcastic . 
  it has to do with * galego * being also a synonym for someone that does hard labour , like agriculture . 
  i think it may be due to seasonal migrations to work in farms here . 
  for slow people we already have the * alentejanos * ( people from alentejo , a province south of the tagus river ) :p  here we say ( something ) is spartan to mention if something is really austere ... we have that one too . 
   branlette espagnole ( spanish wanking ) : nice name for a tittyfuck we also refer to this as something spanish : * uma espanholada * . 
  i 'm curious as to what they call it . 
   `` to speak french like a spanish cow '' we also have that one !, 
  in portuguese : * * \u00c0 grande e \u00e0 francesa * ( the big and french way ) : do something sparing no expenses with ostentation * * para ingl\u00eas ver * ( for an englishman to see ) : do something that will have no real impact but to make a good impression * * ver-se grego * ( see oneself as a greek ) : having difficulties doing something * * agradar a gregos e troianos * ( please greeks and trojans ) : favour everyone ( usually said as something that is impossible to do ) * * de espanha nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos * ( from spain neither good mariages or good winds will come ) : this is more of a proverb than an idiom , it just means to beware of spaniards * * a vingan\u00e7a do chin\u00eas * ( the chinese revenge ) : a well-thought and prepared reaction to something * * despedir-se/sair \u00e0 francesa * ( say goodbye/leave the french way ) : leaving without saying goodbye . 
  * * fazer judiarias * ( do jewish neighbourhoods - yeah , this one sounds silly ) : do something that you should not do , especially when the perpetrator is a child . 
  actually the portuguese word for jew is also a synonym of perverse/cruel normally in a childish way . 
  * * trabalhar que nem um mouro * ( work like a moor ) : work really hard * * andar mouro na costa * ( there 's a moor in the coast ) : this is usually said when a girl has an admirer . 
  * * um neg\u00f3cio da china * ( a chinese deal ) : a very lucrative business deal * * trabalhar como um galego * ( work like a galician ) : work really hard * * em fila indiana * ( in a indian line ) : organize people in single file * * ser chin\u00eas * ( to be chinese ) : characteristic of something that is incompreheensible there are probably more , but these were the ones i could gather from the top of my head . 
  edit : i realise some of these sound racist and apologize if someone is offended , but they have lost their racist connotation and people use them traditionally . 
   portuguese ( by adding caralho after every sentence ) yeah , you 're pretty much right there . 
  xd  anyway , if you want to learn any other romance language is extremely easy . 
  i know romanians speaking a decent fluent spanish after only 6 months here . 
  totally agree with this . 
  it may be hard to get the accents properly , but it 's fairly easy to start speaking any romance language when you already know another one . 
  speaking as a portuguese , we can understand spanish , as long as it 's not from andalusia - those guys speak too fast :p . from my experience , the reverse is not true : spaniards tend to not understand portuguese .
