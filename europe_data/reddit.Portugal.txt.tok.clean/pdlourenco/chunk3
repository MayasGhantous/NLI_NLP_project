  the written languages are , however , very similar . 
  i can also understand a bit of italian , especially written . 
  i ca n't speak much about * natural * comprehension of french , because i studied it in school . 
  as for romanian , some written words i understand , most i do n't . 
  it 's uncanny how most of this would apply to us here . 
  yeah , apparently going to badajoz and buying caramels was all the rage in the late 80 's . 
  we have one official language , portuguese , and one recognized regional language , mirandese . 
  there are around 15k speakers of mirandese ( 0.14 % of the national population ) , and they are mostly confined to a northeastern town , miranda do douro . 
  there were n't much news about it until a few years ago , when the language was officially recognized and some publicity and attention were brought to it . 
  personally i 've never met anyone who speaks it and have never been to miranda , but i know that there is a regular column in mirandese in one of the most important newspapers in the country , and that ( some ) asterix books have been translated to mirandese a few years ago . 
  other than that , i suppose that , being an official regional language , street signs and perhaps municipal documents are bilingual and that it is now taught in schools there , but this is merely an educated guess , sorry . 
  what !? 
  there are people who dislike it ? 
  yeah , it 's the same here in portugal . 
  everybody criticizes everything , but it 's heresy if a foreigner does it . 
  nowadays there is a greater recognition of what is good in the country , though - but criticizing is still a national sport . 
  totally agree with this . 
  i have a ( sometimes very ) firm handshake and loathe `` dead fish '' handshakes . 
  i mean , you do n't have to break my bones shaking my hand , but a little strength is welcome and , as you so well put it , reassuring . 
  how could i forget !, 
  i 'll add it to the post . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i thought of including that , but that is closer to a full meal than to a sandwich , i think ... 
  anyway , [ here 's ] ( http://www.projectofrancesinha.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/raza-francesinhacortada.jpg ) a picture . 
  [ p\u00e3o com chouri\u00e7o ] ( https://easyportugueserecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/img_9849.jpg ) - bread to whose dough is added a portuguese smoked sausage [ prego no p\u00e3o ] ( http://www.iguaria.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/iguaria-petisco-prego-no-pao.jpg ) - bread with grilled/fried beef [ bifana ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/traditional-portuguese-pork-beef-sandwich-bifana-32387855.jpg ) - bread with grilled/fried pork with sauce made with olive oil , garlic , white wine and bay leaf [ sandes de leit\u00e3o ] ( https://webookporto.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/nelson-dos-leitc3b5es-sandes-leitc3a3o.jpg ) - bread with a roasted suckling pig , with pepper sauce . 
  depending on the part of the country ( we 're small but rich in gaastronomy ) , there may be more common sandwiches . 
  furthermore , we basically put anything possible in bread if we need to have a fast meal . 
  edit : i forgot the [ sandes de presunto e queijo ] ( http://www.iguaria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandes-de-presunto-com-queijo.jpg ) as suggested by / u/walkdownstairs, 
  native portuguese . 
  i speak english and spanish fluently , b1 in german , studied french in school for three years ( even though today i ca n't speak it today ) and can understand very little italian . 
  in portugal kids study one foreign language for 8 years ( from 5th to 12th grade - i think that today it may start earlier , i 'm not sure ) , and another for 3 years ( 7th to 9th grade ) . 
  most common languages are english as first and french as second . 
  some schools replace french with spanish , or a few times german . 
   on the basis of your results , we estimate you know 80 % of the english words . 
    you said yes to 80 % of the existing words . 
    you said yes to 0 % of the nonwords . 
    this gives you a corrected score of 80 % - 0 % = 80 % . 
    you are at the top level !, 
  interesting test . 
  but as someone said before , i recognized some of the words without knowing precisely what they meant . 
  it may be because i read a lot in english , and , being a phd student , i have to read/write scientific papers that sometimes have a more `` select '' vocabulary . 
  does anyone know any similar tests for other languages ? 
  i guess that any dish we prepare with blood would fit your criteria :p from `` cabidela '' , which is chicken or rabbit stewed with their own blood with rice , to `` sarrabulho '' which is a paste made with pig blood , corn flour , and minced pork , we have some strange foods that are , for my taste , delicious . 
  i could add snails , most of the sausages ( pig intestine filled with pig fat and minced pork , sometimes with blood too ) , a soup we make with all the insides of a pig ( lungs , heart , spleen , kidneys ) , `` iscas '' ( fried cow , lamb , or pig liver ) , lamprey ( the living proof that the worms in dune exist ) rice , `` mioleira '' ( cow , lamb , or pig brain scrambled with eggs and some herbs ) , `` t\u00fabaros '' ( pig/bull testicles ) , white ham ( smoked pig fat ) , and so on . 
  but do n't let this prevent you from visiting and trying all the other non-disgusting sounding delicious food we have here , 
  we also celebrate st. martin 's day here . 
  we eat chestnuts , drink '' \u00e1gua-p\u00e9 '' or `` jeropiga '' ( made with the pomace residue from wine making ) . 
  usually this occurs in the last remnants of good weather , so we call it st. martin 's summer . 
  yes , it was . 
  and thankfully i never experienced first hand the promotion , because i was only 10 the last time we were in the second league , but in the last few years some teams managed to get promoted for the first time ever and people were ecstatic in those teams ' hometowns . 
  i also forgot to mention that most countries have a national cup , which is usually composed of knockout rounds . 
  these are a great opportunity for smaller teams to have a shot at winning something . 
  in portugal 24 different teams have reached the finals , 12 different teams have won it , and 19 out of 76 times the winner was a team out of the `` big three '' . 
  this opposed to 5 different teams winning the league , and only two times a team out of the usual culprits . 
   what is your favorite football club ? 
  vit\u00f3ria futebol clube ( from set\u00fabal , portugal )  how many games do you go to per year ? 
  i have n't gone to a match in quite a while , but to be honest i 've pretty much only watched international matches recently . 
   do you have a favorite supporter chant ? 
  ( please translate it if it 's not in french of spanish ) . 
  does your team or fanbase have any unique traditions ? 
  yeah , i suppose they do , but i 'm not a very involved fan . 
   how heated is your biggest rivalry ? 
  would you feel safe wearing your team 's jersey alone in your rival team 's city/territory ? 
  what about in their stadium ( outside the designated visiting fan section ) ? 
  given that vit\u00f3ria in the last two decades usually finishes in the lower half of the table , we do n't have any real rivalries . 
  there is a sort of rivalry against another club named vit\u00f3ria ( sport clube ) from the northern part of the country , but nothing like benfica-sporting or benfica-porto . 
   is football ` hooligan ' culture a big problem in your country ? 
  a few years back there were some problems with the organized supporters from the three main clubs and those of the northern vit\u00f3ria ( from guimar\u00e3es ) . 
  most of these guys were either white supremacists , right-wing fanatics or somehow connected with organized crime . 
  i think that today this is much more under control . 
   for those who support mid and low-finishing teams : do you get sick of seeing the same 2-3 teams win your country 's title every year ? 
  well , we certainly like when some underdog team cuts through the big three and manages to be close to the top , but i guess that those top teams are very interesting to watch and therefore it is not so `` boring '' to have them win . 
   do fans celebrate things like getting 6th place ( or not getting relegated ) if their team normally does much worse ? 
  definitely . 
  for example , my team had a wonderful run in the first part of the league , and was on the top 6 . 
  then when the winter market opened , they sold the best players and we tumbled all the way to the third place from the bottom . 
  we only managed to avoid relegation in the last match , and boy , did people celebrate here . 
  in the beginning of the 00 's , we were on the second league , and manage to go up also in the last match at home . 
  our stadium was [ completely full ] ( https://youtu.be/epegtnhkog0?t=30 ) and the whole city partied hard . 
  as for nationalism , i ca n't comment on the austrian situation mentioned by him , but here in the south it means more of an etnic proudness that is maintained even by emigrants . 
  for example , portuguese emigrants in switzerland or france are fairly well integrated in their receiving countries , but they are still very connected to portuguese culture , and feel very proud of their heritage . 
  i think this is true for most of the poorer , emigrant-exporter countries . 
  there is also a recent rise in far-right parties in france , germany , the netherlands , etc. , which may be what he refers as nationalism , i do n't know . 
  as most have said , you are probably going to get more `` dumb american '' comments/looks than anything else :p, 
  it is good to know that the feeling is mutual !, 
  hahaha , thanks !, 
  portuguese here . 
  we have many sayings against the spanish , the best known of which is `` good winds or good marriages will never come from spain '' , even though we actually call them `` nuestros hermanos '' ( our brothers ) . 
  some people call them this pejoratively . 
  this is due to a large history of wars to define our borders , and to unfinished businesses , like oliven\u00e7a / olivenza . 
  in football we have a major thing against the french and everybody hates them , because we lost 3 semi-finals against them ( euro 84 , euro 2000 , wc2006 ) , so this year 's win was even better because of that . 
  napoleon 's invasion is probably a factor here too ( we still remember :p ) . 
  the fact that the french call us masons and concierge as a stereotype for the portuguese immigrants fuels this too . 
  in more recent times , there is a bit of an anti-german sentiment , because people blame merkel and sch\u00e4uble for the austerity our last governments have had to enforce . 
  not sure if we have many more of these . 
  we are a very peaceful country , but we sometimes we like to say small bad things about everybody , and especially about ourselves ( but if a foreigner does it we go apeshit !, 
  portuguese guy here . 
  we dress for the season , but tend to adapt it according to whatever weather we have at the moment . 
  i for one start using shorts as soon as the outside temperature is , say , above 25\u00ba and use them regularly sometimes until october . 
  we have a national holiday on october the 5th , and it is not uncommon for people on the southern part of the country ( where i live ) to go the beach that day , so that should tell you something .
