we are, 
  did you see ochoa vs brazil ? 
  i 'm not saying this is an ugly spot but italy probably has 400.000 places a lot prettier than this . 
  i literally pass by 2 or 3 places pretier than this on my way to work . 
  right to sovereignty ? 
  lol . 
  we are the country with the oldest mostly unchanged borders in europe . 
  we were a country 350 years before isabel and ferdinand married . 
  that 's pure semantics . 
  the province was hispania . 
  any of the kingdoms of iberia could have called themselves that way , or none at all . 
  absurd = very large, 
  by that logic , switzerland seceeded from france ( or in this case , one of its percursors , gaul ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helvetii get a grip . 
  spain did n't even exist for another 350 years . 
  that did not happen . 
  there were a bunch of kingdoms on the iberian peninsula , one stayed a kingdom , the others gathered hundreds of years later to form what is called spain . 
  99,5 % of the news i get regarding catalonia 's `` seccession '' are from / r/europe . 
  the rest from newspapers , tv and all other internet sites i browse . 
  there 's an absurd amount of catalan seccessionists on this subreddit . 
  i 'm not expressing an opinion on the matter . 
  just that there are a lot . 
  this is more like / r/independentcatalonia than r/europe, 
  result : sweden, 
  you mean , english , portuguese and spanish ? 
  the map would be the exact same . 
  if this was a england , portugal and spain diaspora map , it would be the same map . 
  except maybe canada would be slightly lighter , perhaps ? 
  average of -10 ? 
  oliven\u00e7a is not a normal part of spain . 
  it 's not even a part of spain de jure . 
  yes , treaties shoul be respected , huh ? 
  `` during the wars , portugal had lost its town of oliven\u00e7a to spain and moved to have it restored . 
  portugal is historically the oldest ally of the united kingdom , and with its support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of oliven\u00e7a decreed in article 105 of the final act , which stated that the congress `` understood the occupation of oliven\u00e7a to be illegal and recognized portugal 's rights '' . 
  portugal ratified the final act in 1815 but spain would not sign and this became the most important hold-out against the congress of vienna . 
  deciding in the end that it was better to become part of europe than stand alone , spain finally accepted the treaty on 7 may 1817 ; however , oliven\u00e7a and its surroundings were never returned to portuguese control and this question remains unresolved . 
  [ 26 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_vienna it 's funny that spain says the treaty does n't say exactly that , while if it was the opposite they 'd be screaming and moaning about getting their lands back .

  what is this nonsense ? 
  a good list that we actually lead ? 
  so did the portuguese in all likelyhood . 
  seems a bit off at the beginning . 
  portugal is portugal since 1143 but it only appears on the map in 1188-89 . 
  every country has a variation of the dish .

  til !, 
  not really , you just do n't easily go to jail in portugal for possession , it takes a big ( ish ) amount to be criminal court worthy . 
  yours is actually from an existing administrative division . 
  that guy 's is from a republic that was overthrown in the 1930 's . 
  nothing against the flag , just the text when you hover over plottip 's flag , not yours . 
  same flag , different hover text . 
  nothing against your flair , but hover over plottip 's flair . 
  same flag , diferent text . 
  nice insult , dude . 
  have nothing against the flag , just the text . 
  hover the mouse over the flag . 
  it says republic of catalonia . 
  a republic that does n't exist . 
  i might as well ask for a flag of the visigoth kingdom of iberia or the kingdom of the algarves , but those actually existed and/or were recognized kingdoms . 
  why does this subreddit allow a flag flair of a state that does not currently exist nor has ever been recognized ? 
  can i get a roman empire flag or something ? 
  perhaps atlantis ? 
  two things : 1 ) why on earth is this an / r/europe news ? 
  because one of the contenders is european ? 
  2 ) why do these spanish guys have a flag from the republic which was overthrown 80 years ago ? 
  does this mean i can get a portugal coat of arms from 1143 ? 
  downvotes ? 
  i upvoted you . 
  if i downvote you right now you 'll fall from 3 to 1 . 
  about your reply , most of it is true but irrelevant . 
  question is `` shameful moments '' and starting a damn global business of intercontinental slave trade is more shameful than a royal family escaping to brazil . 
  i 'm not talking about whether other countries were more barbaric , just that we started it at that scale . 
  i disagree heartily . 
  check my reply to him . 
  you are , imho , way , way off-course . 
  most shameful moments in our history ? 
  - starting mass worldwide , transcontinental , transoceanic slave trade . 
  - the portuguese inquisition . 
  by all accounts much worse than the spanish . 
  i think we can sum it up in two words : starting globalization . 
  ps - the first expedition to circumnavigate the world was spanish . 
  it was , however , captained by a portuguese , magellan . 
  yeah , it was optional on the 12th . 
  it 's not only france . 
  i had 3 years of philosophy from the 10th to my 12th year , and the questions referred to in the article could very well have been on my exams .

  read the link , man . 
  you used a fallacy called `` no true scotsman '' in your sentence . 
  read this , regarding your fallacy : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman, 
  all those , except jairo , are relatively common in portugal . 
  a spanish name i ca n't remember an equivalent of is rocio . 
  best song ever ? 
  [ spain 2008 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzhombhboeg ) i also like [ belgium 2003 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj79oodk7pi ) , [ denmark 2000 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du1qg6tkn2a ) and [ estonia 2009 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pggivnhfxs0 ) [ france 2008 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8tdnn6vrtq ) was nice too .

  have you been to the uk ? 
  the 2 pence coin is gigantic . 
  so , one can only refer to a country/region by the name given by the locals , in their own dialect/language ? 
  sure ...
