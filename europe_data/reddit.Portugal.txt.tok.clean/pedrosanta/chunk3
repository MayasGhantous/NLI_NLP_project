  but those investments help the economy too . 
  and in a greater extense than that subsidy to the building of an f1 track - since it seems there are n't perspectives of direct return of share of ownership . 
  e-v-e-n s-o , there are priorities right now not only in greece but also in another . 
  even if it generated a cazillion of euros in revenue , ** right now ** , there are hospitals , schools , social and ( real ) economic emergency investments that are in more need of this $ 100m . 
  priorities !, 
  you got ta get them straight !, 
  like jim yong kim from the world bank dixit , we have to ** invest in the people ** : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8seofu4zqk, 
  we will on the europarl 2014 elections . 
  i think under lisbon treaty each europarl group must pre-nominate a comission president . 
  see here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014#candidates_for_commission_president anyways i guess none of the groups nominated barroso so , no barroso after 2014 . 
  cheers . 
  slavery , nice . 
  anyway , i seriously do n't buy this/don ' t believe the troika asked for this , because this is beyond insane , and if it were to be true the troika should be sent to a madhouse right away . 
  no , seriously . 
  one year of university education in portugal : ~ 1000 $ ( public schools ) ~ 3000 $ ( private schools ), 
  agreed , please refrain your opinions to the comments section and keep headlines as neutral/faithful as possible . 
  bitch ahead in the comments after . 
  another one : [ are jobs obsolete ?

  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/opinion/09/07/rushkoff.jobs.obsolete/index.html ), 
  lol what ? 
  you 're right , i was only criticising the overly optimistic faith on greece defaulting and leaving de ez will solve the problems . 
  they 're lying and misleading the people . 
  the neoliberal creed !, 
  am\u00e9n brother !, 
  what i find funny is how the article ends like `` if we let greece go everything will be allright , everything will be fine and rosy again '' . 
  lest they know , lest they know ... 
  cue in imminent ned !, 
  nice post .

  one of those retards where the comment says it all, 
  in 2008 lehman brothers public capital injection into the finantial sector happened . 
  lol , actually that 's sad but true . 
  moreover , a federal anti corruption agency would have much more power to deal/face corruption than national agencies . 
  looks like a fair speculation-proof solution , upvoted . 
  sure , i just do n't think we need to go into this level of harassment and more into serious negotiations - and by serious i mean for both parts . 
  now what i do n't like is the false superiority and the arrogance of some people of countries ` holding the wallet ' . 
  i think that 's neither respect for the people of troubled countries , nor for the officials of every country trying to solve this out , nor for the past leaders that fought and worked hard to build the european project . 
  lastly , sure it 's a greek problem , but not all help involves the transfer of money - help could be offered as know-how and fiscal best practices , for example . 
  saying simply ' i do n't care , it 's a greek problem ' i guess , since we 're in a union , is n't for the good of neither greece nor every other country . 
  oh , too bad you did n't think of that before the introduction of the euro . 
  then you should pay war reparations to greece that you , germans , owe greece . 
  afterall greece does n't have fault that you voted for a maniac that blitzkriegd their whole country . 
  there you have , a german problem . 
  if greece is n't germany problem so why there 's a union set in place ? 
  eu do n't work like it is , so or we move to a full monetary and political union or get back to national currencies . 
  yes , because international markets never screw up , like in the lehman brothers case ... oh wait ... 
  the greeks are n't the only ones responsible for the state of things - there 's much more to the story . 
  moreover are we a union or not ? 
  or we are a union or gtfo !, 
  true , constitutional courts are like the citizens last line of defence . 
  downplaying them like this is a dangerous path to take - a path where everything goes . 
  yes the article does n't have that bias , true - it 's more informative and unbiased . 
  i was only refering to the headline - which is the part most people will see . 
  i always find a little uncomfortable when i see sensationalist and biased ** headlines ** like this , imo . 
  i mean , is n't the court only trying to enforce the rule of a law voted by germany citizens , the very own thing it is supposed to do ? 
  this headline portrays the court as a bunch of grumpy old ones spoiling the party . 
  if we ignore our democracy , our values and our beliefs what will be left to fight for ? 
  europe is in dire ( very dire ! ), 
  situation , but i think sacrificing the little democracy there is left should n't be a solution . 
  so there , let the democracy work , wait for the ruling and [ deal with it ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/052/812/deal_with_it_dog_gif.gif ) . 
  every country has them , sigh .

  sorry , i think it already has on the occupy protests . 
  yes , pretty please . 
  lol , nice one . 
  wow , just realized that 2 years have passed since he wrote/i read that - and we 're pratically in the same spot or worse . 
  just , wow . 
  ( wondering how confidence fairy looks like ... ), 
  yep , i really do n't know what ` signs ' are you talking about . 
  in portugal the deficit just increased to higher levels than last year ( when we had the bailout ) , the internal demand and economic activity is speeding it 's way down - thanks to wage cuts , which due to the deficit fiasco could happen again this year - , external demand is slowing , so i really do n't see what ` signs ' you 're talking of . 
  and last time i checked irish economy is n't exactly taking off as projected . 
  i dunno about you guys but i loved the pun . 
   cheers , mate . 
  sure , no probs . 
   if you look at it i think it 's a us like dual chamber : one where citizens are proportionally represented and one where states are equally represented , like today 's council and us senate . 
  the problem of today 's eu council imo is that it only have the heads of state ( only one per country ) and that does n't quite reflect the political diversity of that country , it should be like 2-4 eu council members per state imo . 
  this is stupid . 
  period . 
  nope , i think they only appoint the 2nd chamber . 
  i mean the ` alentejo ' region is all good - the food is probably the best in portugal too . 
  i do n't know much about the spanish coast but the ` alentejo ' coast / ` costa vicentina ' is a top also - it 's the southwest coast of portugal . 
  have fun !, 
  trudat , same goes for portuguese . 
  * facepalm *, 
  lol , what 's this supposed to be ? 
  euro cup ? 
  yields ? 
  ca n't find the pattern . 
  i told you ... here come the bond vigilantes/crooks : [ spain 's benchmark bond yield hits euro-era record on bank deal angst ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/12/markets-global-idusl5e8hce8e20120612 ), 
  misleading title . 
  he 's not opposed . 
  downvoted . 
  no , [ it 's now that the shit is really going down ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/business/global/monti-struggles-to-keep-italy-from-being-the-next-domino-to-fall.html?pagewanted=all ) . 
  meanwhile ... `` 2010 is calling , he says he needs this thing fast ! '', 
  imo , i think it makes more sense for the irish to be fairly annoyed at this - since it 's a similar situation , banking bailout - than the greeks and the portuguese ( state bailout ) .
