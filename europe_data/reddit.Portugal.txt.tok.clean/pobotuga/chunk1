if history really repeats itself , europe will be `` fine '' . 
  the usa had a financial crisis and received lots of european refugees before the second world war . 
  the problem was for the regions already at undeclared war . 
  it is hard to wait and see , thinking what can i do now to have a better future . 
  years ago , it was the financial crisis that would change europe . 
  now it is the refugees crisis . 
  europe will just keep changing and adapting . 
  still , i do n't know if / r/theydidthemath . 
  maybe he guessed . 
  revenue management is getting harder inside europe ... 
  they must be sleeping ... 
  it will be an exception . 
  i do not know how they will make the law , but they will have to change it . 
  sources in pt : [ law that defines the exemption of the taxation ] ( http://www.min-saude.pt/nr/rdonlyres/637e141e-4f77-4654-8410-2d9d35995ab3/0/declei117_2014.pdf ) [ document about exemptions ] ( http://www.acss.min-saude.pt/portals/0/guia%20de%20acolhimento%20aos%20utentes-%20taxas%20moderadoras%20janeiro%202014.pdf ), 
  from what i understood , pregnant women are still exempted from taxes since the first medical appointment to six months after the birth . 
  however , abortion is now a paid service , an exception to the general law . 
  one of the last places where the portuguese gov. 
  sent them was the [ hospital-col\u00f3nia rovisco pai in pt news ] ( http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/infancias-de-vitrine-1663305 ) , in the center of the country . 
  portugal was less affected during the middle ages , since there were less crusades and was on the `` end '' of europe , far from the main battles and commerce . 
  yes , as i said the poorest do not pay , but forget to source that information . 
  based on that same link , in order to obtain exemption from the moderation taxes you have to fill a requirement , you can have help to fill it in the health center or other locations indicated . 
  you are exempted if you receive less than $ 628,83 . 
  if you are a couple , the salaries are putted together and divided by two to achieve the average monthly salary . 
  the minimum salary is $ 505 , and on average a supermarket worker receives $ 600 . 
  according to the news , it can reach a maximum of $ 63 and includes everything regarding the abortion . 
  regarding other services , here are some of the prices : * general appointment - $ 5 * urgency - $ 15,45 ( with a maximum of $ 50 ) source : [ ers - health regulator ] ( https://www.ers.pt/pages/142 ), 
  what ? 
  i think this bill has nothing to do with insurances . 
  one of the reasons for forcing counselling is that they will be informed about the benefits and social support that exists source : [ portuguese news ] ( http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=4694237 ) still , i believe this was a harsh measure , with good and bad measures . 
  this is in public hospitals , and you pay a `` moderation tax '' . 
  a small fee that was created to finance the national healthcare service and to avoid people going to the hospital with minor problems . 
  it will still be accessible to everybody and the poorest will not pay anything . 
  before this law , abortion was not paid because it was under the maternal services , and pregnant women do not pay the `` moderation tax '' . 
  it was good to change the law , but i believe they changed too much to appease the conservative people . 
  the problem that i see is that they receive a benefit over the income tax , and it does not matter where the income comes from . 
  in portugal i know farmers can get discounted fuel and subsidies but you must follow some rules . 
  it is not perfect but sounds better than what is stated on this article . 
  i guess farmville was the real deal . 
  the problem is about the real farmers , the ones that live from agriculture . 
  but after reading the advantages the greeks have just by declaring themselves as farmers , i wonder how did they make these laws in order to have so many people taking advantage . 
  i do n't know many policies or in deep information , but here is my knowledge . 
  ten years ago the tax collecting department modernized , with a great investment in modernizing and having the information online . 
  this was great for cross information and to easily track who is fleeing from the taxes . 
  in the recent years , with troika , the great measures were the ones above . 
  the modern software and equipment continues and it crosses information with several government departments . 
  it is estimated that next year most irs papers ( the ones that people will have to deliver ) will be pre-filled , with companies having to send information to the irs department and then the people will just accept and/or add/change information . 
  the idea behind is turning people in fiscals , which improved the vat collecting . 
  however , if you look at the information at the side of the image , it says it is from `` source : \u00c0 la recherche de la cit\u00e9 id\u00e9ale , institut claude-nicolas ledoux , 2000 . '', 
  original link with text : [ link to the site ] ( http://www.radicalcartography.net/ ) - then go to * yummy * europe network le syst\u00c8me des villes du monde denise pumain , 2000 `` straight-line distance between cities of 100,000 people or more '' ( heavy lines are < 100km , light lines are < 150km ) source : \u00c0 la recherche de la cit\u00e9 id\u00e9ale , institut claude-nicolas ledoux , 2000 . 
  2000 and yuguslavia is there ? 
  very weird, 
  some of those cities ( if not all ) are less than 100km away from madrid . 
  that map was made with some crazy rules . 
  according to the news , the expense was 3.4 million euros . 
  regarding the advantages : * 190,000 offenders/cases were caught due to this measures . 
  ( [ pt source ] ( http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/economia/325374/fatura-da-sorte-poe-a-descoberto-190-mil-infratores ) ) * vat revenues increased 9,2 % , but not all from the measures ( [ pt source ] ( http://www.sol.pt/noticia/399049 ) ) it was a very good incentive because it was a positive measure and people like to win , instead of negative rules such as higher fines or jail time that people just find new ways to escape . 
  in portugal the government modernized the tax collecting department , but in the last years there were two important measures . 
  * if you ask invoice with your tax identification number , you can get a benefit of 15 % of the tax you paid . 
  ( only available in certain services ) * every week an audi a4 is drawn for a tax payer , by raffle . 
  you get raffles by asking the invoice with your fiscal number . 
  ( unfortunately it is believed audi was chosen due corruption by the importer ) in restaurants , this had a great effect . 
  how is the price of bread capped ? 
  a value per 100grams ? 
  capping such a good must decrease the variety in bread . 
  in portugal we have such a great variety of breads and prices that capping would be hard . 
  that 's why i put genetic in italic , it 's not necessary genetics , it 's the unique type of body that part of that population has . 
  i did not have a better work than `` genetics '', 
   how does alternative medicine take into acount genetic differences ? 
  if that 's what you were saying . 
  experience . 
  and in this i am talking about home made syrups , fresh air for baby 's with cough or [ this tinitus cure ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/3l3uri/these_guys_lighting_a_mortar_shell_in_their_garage/cv3474n ) edit : sorry , forgot about the genetic part . 
  but basically experience in the rural villages lead to advances in their * rural * medicine . 
  yes , i understand the principle of vaccines . 
  and regarding your example , i believe sugar and other ingredients may affect your concentration , but that is proved with some regular medicine . 
  my problem with homeopathy or alternative medicine is how the regular medicine still lacks some studies on our * genetic * differences . 
  for example , i remember a documentary that studied the indian population and their sugar intake . 
  due to their diet and evolution until now , the indian population would suffer from diabetes faster than the western population . 
  the explanation until now was due to their diet with vegetables and rice , and less fruit than the western culture . 
  but that would take another topic . 
  thanks for your inputs . 
  i 've already read before trying . 
  did n't dive into without knowing . 
  that 's why i also tried . 
  it would be hard to do any damage . 
  regarding $ , i 've probably spend between $ 100/150 . 
  regarding your principle , `` treat problems with substances '' , is n't that what vaccines do ? 
  my experience took some months . 
  it grew for months and in the months i took the homeopathic remedies , it started to reduce and stop it . 
  my lifestyle was more or less the same , continue to do sports/gym and did not change my diet . 
  i do n't know much about biology but i 've read some theories about the ph of our body , and the influences of it . 
  about allergies , i have a friend that is now allergic to cats , but that allergy was never * active * since she always lived with cats when she was with her parents . 
  the doctor ( regular ) told her it is usual , since she had contact with cats everyday the allergies would not not appear . 
  now that she has contact with the cats with low regularity , the allergy appears . 
  i can speak of my experience with homeopathy . 
  tried it after having a pilonidal cyst , it was growing and pus would come out . 
  homeopathy made my life much better and the cyst diminished its size and stopped the pus . 
  i remember that i took 5 different things at the same time in water and one of them had sort of an alcohol smell , it did not seem pure water . 
  after my experience , i liked what homeopathy can do . 
  however , i went first to a doctor and he told me the pilonidal cyst was not urgent to treat , so i tried homeopathy . 
  if i ever need to go to a doctor , i still go first to regular medicine .
