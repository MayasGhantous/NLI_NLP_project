  hard to say since there are poor that do n't mind being poor , and poor that work hard to improve their life . 
  portugal is great to be poor and working the minimum wage if you like sunny days , cheap beer and live near the coast . 
  correlations are beautiful, 
  nice one for the * piigs * i know the reason for such a number of `` fighters '' is not for money , but this graphs show integration are a real problem and in the future the distrust will be a bigger problem . 
  i know some people do it and there are several routes known as the route to santiago . 
  and even for people [ with reduced mobility ] ( http://www.correiodominho.com/noticias.php?id=93160 ) . 
  the recent problem is that some local business ( hotels and cafes ) are changing direction signs so that the road to santiago passes by the business and are not so direct . 
  as a portuguese , i agree . 
  have done some good road trips to the interior of spain , passing by the interior of portugal, 
  thanks , any expectations for the future ? 
  new elections before or after the summer , is this influencing the nationalism in * catalunha * ? 
  what about the regions ? 
  do you feel they have more to gain now with the national instability ? 
  probably : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escrava_isaura_%281976_telenovela%29 such a great success that it needed a `` remake '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_escrava_isaura_%282004_telenovela%29, 
  unless he emigrates ... 
  paris was attacked by * muslims * , everything else is forgotten . 
  yes and they usually work for private transportation companies . 
  lol next referendum , leave nato because they allow foreign soldiers on the queen soil, 
  if you look at this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_football_association_board https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_association_of_wales you 'll notice that the first members were part of gb but have separate associations . 
  for the olympics , they use gb since the first games https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_britain_at_the_olympics, 
  it 's true and i know it , but if someone told me that they were going to spend tax money on a `` military and weather '' project that would give return in a hundred years . 
  i would be against it . 
  i have visited and it 's worth it . 
  nice one eiffel, 
  today it is , but when it was built , not so much . 
  those parisians were still right . 
  they did n't take much benefit from the tower . 
  and if suddenly every city would have a steel tower , it would no longer be unique . 
  finnish saunas are quite hot ... usually over the 70/80, 
  true but when the capital and royal court are an ocean away , your noble power is less significant than the nobles in brazil . 
  well ...  really good at football . 
  won euro2016 . 
  i 'm not catholic nor good at football , but still portuguese . 
  generalization is what it is . 
   they were n't ruled by brazil the capital and royal court were in brazil , so the orders would go from brazil to portugal . 
   it 's had the same borders for the past 800 + years . 
  [ removed ], 
  sort of `` is someone there ? '', 
  a bit stupid when i think of the direct translation sort of `` are you there ? '', 
  they are present and i 've seen a `` shop '' in lisbon avenue ( almirante reis ) . 
  but that 's all . 
  churches that have grown are iurd ( * universal church of the god reign * ) and igreja man\u00e1, 
  not in portugal . 
  i already visited wal-mart , while in the states , and there is almost nothing to compare . 
  the worst are probably gypsies talking loud and letting the kids run around the supermarket while grabbing things . 
  but after visiting france , gypsies in portugal are calm . 
  in portugal we usually have 1 hour lunchbreak . 
  equality and fairness would be good , but unfortunately lobbying is far more powerful . 
  regarding the example i know , in the small portuguese villages , they would be worse . 
  they would save at max 6 % on food , but some is still produced locally . 
  an increase from 6 % to 23 % on taxi which they use monthly would hurt more . 
  it may be unfair and the rich benefit from that , but it 's a small industry and the rich can pay more for * exclusive * rich stuff like bigger houses or better cars . 
  hotels and restaurants are a difficult subject . 
  hotels are 6 % in portugal because they are in the `` housing '' , and because that vat is helping the tourism industries that creates several jobs . 
  the rich may use it , but a lower vat is supposed to help to create jobs . 
  regarding restaurants , the same thought may apply , but in portugal we 've had the standard rate . 
  keeps people entertained . 
  what do you think is good for people ? 
  just lower vat for food and have a society that ust enjoys free stuff ? 
   taxi i know plenty of small villages that only have a taxi to take older people to the city centers . 
  they are dependent on the taxi to go to the bank , supermarket , services offices . 
  they are poor and old , they share a taxi and the alternatives would probably be much worse . 
  if you want to see what happens in a city or locally , of course it is unfair . 
  but nationwide the vat should be fair for everyone . 
  like i said , it 's culture . 
  culture should have a lower vat because it 's good for people , meaning books , newspapers and others have a low vat . 
  it 's like saying golf , tennis and football should have different vat because of the people who practice it . 
   taxi is used more by wealthier people wealthy people can have a driver , a car , or richer taxi services by phone ( instead of the one that is available to everyone ) . 
  it 's hard to say who deserves what . 
  i think taxi is in `` transportation tax '' , deserving a lower vat , the same as public transports . 
  it is unfair , but that would be a very specific job to differentiate vat by specific subcategories . 
  overall vat is for poor people since it is a consumption tax and poor people consume more as a percentage of their wage than the rich . 
  because it 's culture . 
  opera is the same as music festivals and concerts , and some poor people save to go to these . 
  just because they do n't go to opera nowadays , does n't mean that cultural events should get a higher vat according to the attendees . 
   taxi and bus taxi may be the only alternative to poor people if they need to get somewhere that public transports do n't get . 
  i believe essential food already has the lower vat . 
  at least they do where i live . 
  regarding lowering taxes , the lowest/minimum wages already have ~ 0 % taxes in some countries . 
   services these are n't subsidies . 
  they are not necessarily fair but they help services that employ poor people . 
  they still pay taxes . 
  just because the vat is lower , it does not mean someone is paying for it , and if the vat was higher , it does not help poor people directly and maybe not indirectly . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf if you check the link you will notice that `` admission to sporting events '' is not consensual in europe , some apply the standard vat , others apply the reduced . 
  it 's hard to define which products and services deserve which vat . 
  opera is a cultural service , it deserves a lower vat . 
  taxi and public transportation are the only solution for those who do n't have a car . 
  but these are services , integrated in areas like `` culture '' , `` tourism '' or `` beauty '' . 
  physical products are usually more well definable as essential/non-essential, 
  i do n't know about the other taxes , but they are probably high too . 
  it 's a tax over consumption , and it ends costing more to the poor , but then there are taxes for buying a house or a car that cost more to the rich . 
  the govs. 
  need money and they tax wherever they can, 
  that 's why there are usually two vat in most countries . 
  lower for essential products higher for all products except essential . 
  in european countries the vat has been high since it is one of the easier ways to increase the government revenues . 
  what do you mean ? 
  vat in europe is over the products and is the same for most products . 
  after thinking about it , i believe it is a math problem . 
  also how did you calculate the vat ?
