  keep in mind we really like to go out and drink a beer and wine , so you will find that and nightlife anywhere you go . 
  algarve is only more touristic . 
  think mallorca or ibiza comparing to the rest of spain . 
  portugal is a small country , so you can easily rent a car and travel around all these places in a week or so , and the price of things will constantly put a smile in your face ( mainly if you keep away from lisbon and algarve ) . 
  i am glad to answer any help you have . 
  i know really well the north in particular ( porto and up ) . 
  i have travel a lot around the world , and porto is one of the most beautiful cities i know . 
  i am obviously biased , but i think it 's totally worth it , 
  this is already more or less true even for straight people . 
  when you donate blood in portugal one of the gazillion questions they ask is if you had more than one sexual partner in the last 6 months . 
  i think the equality with which you see the human nature is a great argument in favor of gay couple adoption . 
  yes some of them will be crappy parents , some of them will be ok parents , some of them will be the best they can and much more . 
  we have all seen all types of parenthood around us , and the important part to understand is that it does not depend on them being homosexual or straight or chinese or spanish or what ever . 
  why do n't you come over for your summer holidays mate ? 
  for a northerner everything will be very affordable ( if you 're from norway then , you 'll be a king ) . 
  since the 19th century ? 
  we have come a long way much more recently , since the 80 's . 
   so it 's germany/france 's fault that greek polticians are corrupt and that they overspend money that they lend on french products ? 
  let me turn the question around : is it acceptable that [ german companies ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html ) abuse a corrupt system . 
  and is it acceptable they go over the german government when their corrupt deals fail ? 
  i do n't think they would go as far if greece was not on the eu and with the euro , because they know how institucionally protected they are , which is bad . 
  ask yourself : how would you feel if you knew corruption was not through exports , but rather affect your internal finances ( tax evasion , for example ) . 
  would you feel and act differently ? 
  would your moral response be different ? 
   so if i go to an electronics store and they offer installments instead of upfront payment it 's their fault if i buy too much shit ? 
  if a bank starts to say yes to every 1 million euros loan asked , and it suddenly everybody stops paying , fuck them they do n't know how to do business . 
  do n't go over the government if you ca n't manage your loan risk , as a restaurant does not go over the government if they make crappy food , or your electronics store does not call merkel if clients stop paying installments . 
  there is an associated risk they have to be aware of , they have to manage . 
  you fail , you go bankrupt , you disappear , someone new and smarter will come . 
  i think there is greek responsibility , of course . 
  i think that is undeniable ( although wether or not the normal greek should morally carry that burden is more of a philosophical question ) . 
  but the country itself has their share of responsibility , of course . 
  and be sure , they will carry the burden for a long time . 
  what i feel is that this overprotection is prejudicial and unhealthy to a good economic climate in europe . 
  the pressure banking and other strong industry sectors puts on governments is bad . 
  is bad for you and is bad for me . 
  the sense of power and protectionism this actions create is bad , and is bad if it happens in portugal , or in the states , or in germany or in europe . 
  because a company only makes good , smart decisions under the fear of their well being and under the pressure of competitiveness . 
  far more powerful , absolutely . 
  more useful , maybe . 
  an actual country , no way . 
  something old school from portugal : [ sam the kid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufcsbzp4lh0 ) [ dealema ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-ckjcaqznm ) [ da weasel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pllopdaphas ) something more trendy : [ valete ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxrllgm9ye ) - i wo n't put a nsfw tag here because yeah , but the lyrics are hardcore in this one [ capicua ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58awapajrma ) - our rapper girl edit to had this album : [ beats vol . 
  1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=topfu5f26t0&amp;list=pl5f591ab3fd96e81f ) . 
  super chill sampling , very well executed , one of my favorite albums ever for relaxing time . 
  and since it 's only instrumental and the little lyrics are english , you call all enjoy it my dear europe . 
  let me just had this here to say that there is n't one ` camino de santiago ' , there are multiple routes , some of them all the way from russia . 
  check [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/stjacquescompostelle1.png ) for example . 
  i have never done it myself , but i know a lot of people that had , by foot or biking , and they all love it . 
  some take only a few days by bike . 
  and if you really liked it , you can try another route next year  i can had some more information or answer questions if someone is interested . 
  and 26 % unemployment . 
  i do n't know if we are talking about the same thing , but my point is that it is an unfair distribution for spain , not germany . 
  i 've always seen the earlier responses to italy 's ask for help ( economic or otherwise ) as so damn selfish . 
  a good example of how the lack of european cohesion can make everything worse for everybody . 
  i was giving an example , but funny enough , see this [ answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nuhfw/czech_president_zeman_if_you_approve_of/cvrx73b ) below . 
  that was an interesting read , thank you for the link . 
  on the first sight that seems like a reasonable suggestion . 
  the actual commission 's proposal looks definitely of . 
  spain takes half the migrants germany does !, 
  i think one of the biggest problems is on the definition of ` fairly distributed ' . 
  what is this ? 
  by population ? 
  but portugal and spain have 16 % and 26 % unemployment , respectively . 
  by gdp per capita ? 
  but then the netherlands or luxembourg can , understandably , be afraid of the impact of a substantial % of the population becoming migrants . 
  i agree refugees should be fairly distributed , but i also think there has to be sustainability , and each country has it 's own reality and it 's own concerns , even if we all agree there is important morale in ` trying our best ' . 
  maybe this is an example of where more economic and political cohesion in european would suit everybody better . 
  but this is another topic . 
  haha i came here to say the same . 
  best neighbor : spain . 
  spain is chill worst neighbor : spain . 
  motherfuckers, 
  haha . 
  the good old times . 
   and look at what voting useful did ? 
  if you voted ps , you already knew costa would lose and you would waste your vote on more money for ps . 
  if you voted psd , you already knew psd would n't get the majority and you wasted your vote on more money for psd . 
  good job . 
  i agree with you here . 
  i believe it is a good alternative voting on the smaller parties . 
  you serve a continuous grow and it 's healthy they have representation in the parliament . 
  but if it is a close call between psd and ps i think it is understandable your vote shifts to ps . 
  if i lean to the left , i think i would rather have ps to psd governing , or at least i see it as reasonable reasoning . 
  and let 's not forget ps was the [ biggest winner ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/eleicoes/autarquicas2013/?candidato=&amp;distrito=&amp;concelho=&amp;freguesia=&amp;ano=2013&amp;eleicao=am ) in the municipal elections of 2013 , which if anything makes it more amazing . 
  the south is definitely much more left leaning . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.publico.pt/autarquicas2013/resultados ) for the local elections of 2013 . 
  by far the biggest group of municipalities that elected left oriented mayors are in the south ( in black ) . 
  i can not give you an educated guess on the reason . 
  [ a country split in half ] ( http://imgur.com/m4zqoqa ) ( [ source ] ( http://www.publico.pt/ ) ) . 
   often two patrols go on the alarms in these areas so that one patrol can guard the vehicles . 
  i am not sure why this means they are cowards . 
  and while i agree with american police force responding aggressively , you seem more concerned with the fulfillment of your sense of justice rather than it 's truth impact on crime and safety . 
  that seems like appeasement shit to me . 
   the independent deterrent was seen as necessary in case the soviet union believed that it could threaten nuclear attack on western europe without the risk of us retaliation , because of us fears of a soviet counter-strike against its own population centers . 
  [ 2 ] without a credible us umbrella , european leaders would be susceptible to nuclear blackmail which could force them into major concessions . 
  [ 14 ] - [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_trident_programme#cold_war_policy ) let me correct my statement , as the [ original source ] ( http://fc95d419f4478b3b6e5f-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.r87.cf1.rackcdn.com/6ac6fe79ae5e485db3a2b579b6ae0654.pdf ) ( read point 5 . ), 
  says the concern was the ussr could perceive an attack on the uk would have a stagnant response by the us . 
  if this statement was only political ( an ally can not doubt on another ally ) or it was truly a concern , is arguable . 
  but it shows different geographic interests .
