they are retreating . 
  someone is going to get a letter at home to appear on court . 
  as good as this may sound , this is not a solution to the problem . 
  even if europe wanted it 's impossible to take so many refugees and they would still come . 
  i did n't post on the ones that i was n't sure enough . 
  north ( porto , braga , guimar\u00e3es ) - people that speak loud , friendly . 
  alentejo - people from there do n't do nothing , literally nothing , or if they do , they do it as slowly as possible . 
  throwing a grenade in there is just being an asshole ... 
  you go to a stadium to watch football , not to discuss politics . 
  i do n't know why is it impossible . 
  were n't the nazis already extinct ? 
  i 've seen the flag but just because morocco , the state never had ceuta does n't mean it is n't rightfully his . 
  that land was conquered in the start of colonization and should be treated as an overseas province . 
  in terms of borders spain still has a imperialism mind : + did n't return olivenza to portugal + did n't return ceuta to morocco + claiming `` ilhas selvagens '' stop spain , we are not in the 16th century . 
  however if portugal joined the allies , spain would join the axis . 
  portugal 's dictator was pro-allies even though he was a dictator , he hated hitler 's dehumane actions but he wanted to be neutral at all cost . 
  thankfully we could help uk and u.s. by invoking the old treaty of windsor ( 1386 ) with u.k.  upon the declaration of war , the portuguese government announced that the anglo-portuguese alliance remained intact , but since the british did not seek portuguese assistance , portugal would remain neutral . 
  in an aide-memoire of september 5 , 1939 , the british government confirmed the understanding . 
  ** from the british perspective , portuguese non-belligerence was essential to keep spain from entering the war on the side of the axis . 
  **  the portuguese and english agreed that neutrality for portugal was the most viable stance though portugal helped the alliance in other ways like evacuating civilians from gilbraltar to madeira and allowing later in the war , bases in the azores . 
  portugal even discouraged franco from an alliance with the axis , even signed the iberian pact where spain and portugal agreed to fight together any invading army . 
   september 1940 , winston churchill wrote to salazar congratulating him on his ability to keep portugal out of the war , asserting that `` as so often before during the many centuries of the anglo-portuguese alliance , british and portuguese interests are identical on this vital question . ''  november 1943 , sir ronald campbell , the british ambassador in lisbon , wrote that `` strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from portugal 's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in allies ' favour spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of germany . 
  if this had happened the peninsula would have been occupied and then north africa , with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the axis . 
  agreed !!, 
  turks only fight when isis attack them . 
  they usually relate to either football ( soccer ) or friends hanging out in a bar . 
  [ sagres youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/sagresscc ) - they are sponsors of benfica ( portuguese team ) and the portuguese league . 
  focus more on people cheering for their team . 
  [ super bock youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/cervejasb ) - focus more on friends . 
  this is good to know out of curiosity where tourists come from , just look at the car 's license plate . 
  this gave me chills !, 
  it 's sad they just do it after being attacked ... 
  french comedy movies are ** excellent ** [ [ pt ] a guerra dos but\u00f5es | [ fr ] la guerre des boutons | [ en ] war of the buttons ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861375/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 ), 
  for me it 's the eu member 's politicians . 
  they are n't pathetic like american/brazilians candidates/politicians and they have an image of respect and openness to dialogue with . 
  if i could name the best person who would embody it would be alex tsipras , because it 's not about being wrong or right , it 's about how they handle the situation . 
  linked to the wrong one . 
  not the first time :  the 2001 beach soccer world championship was the seventh edition of the beach soccer world championship , an international beach soccer competition contested by men 's national teams , which came under the auspices of fifa in 2005 and was renamed fifa beach soccer world cup . 
  for the first time since its establishment in 1995 , the tournament took place outside of rio de janeiro , namely in costa do sauipe , from 11 to 18 february . 
  it was also the first time that brazil did not win the title -- ** portugal beat france 9 -- 3 in the final ** -- and finished outside the top three . 
  not the first . 
   the 2001 euro beach soccer cup was the third euro beach soccer cup , one of europe 's two major beach soccer championships at the time , held in february 2001 , in maspalomas , spain . 
  ** portugal won the championship ** , with hosts spain finishing second . 
  italy beat germany in the third place play off to finish third and fourth respectively , replicating the result of the 1998 euro beach soccer cup . 
  but it 's different to never join the ez ( like england ) than to join and then leave it . 
  it 's like double or nothing . 
  but if interests are too damn high you will never get out of the situation and you 'll end up paying only the interests . 
  for someone who did n't pay his ww debts having his money taken away and given to the greeks is not so bad in my pov . 
  debt has to be paid but only the money that was lent not the non stop growing interest and not at a rate that ruins all your economy . 
  i 'm happy they voted no and i hope they are n't going to leave eu . 
  but we ca n't denie it 's a step closer, 
  and there are records that say salazar wanted the allies to win . 
  thanks for the info man . 
  could you please name some more movies about the uprisings ? 
  i wonder what 's their backup plan to leave that place ? 
  obviously not , we can just watch them die ... 
   mr juncker , 61 , who has been president since 2014 , said that refugees can not pick and choose where they are housed in europe and that they have a responsibility to go where there is space . 
   he said it was `` outrageous '' and `` not acceptable for refugees in greece and italy to refuse to take the plane for desinations other than germany . ''  mr juncker added that eu governments are willing to accept refugees from greece and italy , who were struggling to cope with the influx , '' but there are very few refugees who agree to be relocated . '', 
  so you can stop saying that eu governors are dumb / naive , and that they never thought economic migrants would try to come to europe . 
  just because there are economic migrants it does n't mean there are n't real refugees seeking asylum . 
  is there any audio / video of this ? 
   measures against tax evasion they have been working on it . 
  go to the european comission twitter or facebook . 
  look at portugal and you 'll see that we have currently the pm and president on opposite parties but they are getting along really well . 
  it 's not the system that 's wrong , it 's the unwillingness of thoso that do not put aside their differences to work for a common goal . 
  what about him ( the dad ) ? 
  when someone declares war to a nato member it 's like they declare war on every nato member . 
  just because us can sail out does n't mean the rest of europe will . 
   invasion of baltic states sweden and finland have got their backs . 
  you 're not really getting it , the possibility of the eu court to intervine is to make sure that they decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  it depends on what eu law it can be . 
  i do n't think they will appeal to the eu court but if in any of the treaties or eu law mandates something about national parliament sovereignty it 's possible to go to eu court . 
  yes , so hard to get information about the council : http://europa.eu/rapid/latest-press-releases.htm, 
  do you need a drawing ? 
  it 's not about the article 50 itself , it 's a matter of constitucional law . 
  it always do . 
  eu law  national law, 
  if she cuts the deal with turkey your country is the first to suffer the consequences , so i think you should think a little bit before you talk . 
  when you build a border you do it on your territory . 
  we have all saint 's day in 1 november and day of the death in 2 november , but since only 1 nov. is an holiday people `` comemorate '' both in 1 nov. 
  and if you are only in the eu to get money from italy , germany and france voters will get angry that you 're not contributing to the union . 
   i remember being 8 years old and in greece and wondering : `` why do they have snow on the mountains in summer ??? '', 
  they just made it official for `` professionalism '' purposes . 
  the examples you gave were not examples of racism but instead of xenophobia . 
   xenophobia is not only aversion to a person but it is a fear or dislike of other cultures and beliefs . 
  maybe i 've wordled it wrong . 
  i translated some words in google translate and it 's more like tissue , embroidery and stuff . 
  it 's not really a big thing but in the northern border we see many spanish mainly buying these stuff . 
  it 's cool to see if it 's not in a battle , but i wonder if the crew likes to be on that ship . 
  we are actually proud of our tapestry . 
  tell me about it !, 
   ca n't wait until people realize this movie , is in fact , pretty fucking bad really cool to see you were one of the lucky ones to get the chance of seeing it in one of the three public screenings !, 
  well , people have to do something with their spare time , before the industrial revolution there was no football clubs and now look how much money is involved and how much people live by it . 
  no , they are only done in villages on the north of portugal , in the region of [ tr\u00e1s-os-montes e alto douro ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr%c3%a1s-os-montes_e_alto_douro ), 
  we had to wait for our dictatorship to end :( but in 1911 we had our first woman to vote ( by a legal void that was changed in 1913 ) [ carolina beatriz \u00c2ngelo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carolina_beatriz_%c3%82ngelo ), 
  you ca n't compare guys beating the crap out of people to ours just harassing people . 
  i guess tourism and all the entertainment industry will get a bigger boost than in the industrial revolution . 
   what if i told you , that living with other people your age who are also studying and partying , is fun . 
  and ** expensive ** . 
  but wallonia is not an indepent country .
