  because african countries have sovereignity . 
  do you think some african country could go the czech republic to prosecute a czech citizen ? 
  did they take them ? 
  yeah because eu decisions do n't need unanimity / s, 
  no , they are busy with [ `` right to repair '' ] ( https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/621424/eu-lawmakers-call-right-repair-electronic-equipment/?fp=16&amp;fpid=1 ) . 
  but this is n't an issue that can be solved easily , and it 's even worse if we consider the recent backlashs about soverignity . 
   2 years that 's a eu law so everybody here has it . 
   however in this this bill ... 
  i did n't see anything of that in the article , mainly because it makes no sense . 
  yeah , because boko haram only targets blacks . 
  comparing terrorists attacks in nigeria to those in europe is a bad joke . 
  boko haram is a terrorist group in nigeria . 
  no , i want to do whatever the hell i want with my goods . 
   nigeria what is boko haram ? 
  how is it giving a right to a costumer decreasing its rights ? 
   you have the right to buy whatever you like i do n't know about you but i think we should have the right to repair our ** own ** products if we want . 
  if companies want money they better sell good products instead of scamming costumers . 
  i only have 1 . 
  which was n't really pleasent when heavy rain wet my shoes :(, 
  except this proposal is to give the consumer a choice , of giving a right to repair their property . 
   because germany needs it germany is one of the few that helps you and you still shit on them while austria and hungary are the ones letting you rot . 
  and if you roll it back again you see uk is the # 2 worst , between 01.07.2014 and 01.08.2015 , what 's the reason for that ? 
  lol the english are the worst in terms of attendance . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-member-states-attendance.html ), 
  did n't the guy that wrote bond was a spy himself ? 
  hopefully estonia will educate the rest of eu members on how to use technology , we need it . 
  i see what you did there . 
   spelling mistakes it 's called a typo  the eu awarding citizenship to non-eu nationals is outside of its current mandate . 
  it 's simply not something the member states have currently given the eu power to do . 
  the member states are represented in the eu institutions and in the eu process of making new laws , if they decide to award eu citizenship to british nationals then it 's possible to do it . 
  with that in mind you 're thinking that every law needs to be voted by unanimity in the european council , but althought i do not have information in that regard since the proposal has not been made yet , it might not be the case you 're thinking of . 
  you need to graps the concept that there are ** 2 ** citizenships being referred to . 
  one is the national citizenship where only the member states can offer it and then there is the ** eu citizenship ** which is automatically awarded when you get the national citizenship . 
  so , right now for pratical reasons , the only way to get an eu citizenship is to get a national citizenship . 
  that 's why guy is working on a proposal to award eu citizenship to british nationals , this way you are not ** automatically ** giving but ** manually ** giving a citizenship . 
   yes , so eu citizenship requires you to hold nationality in one of the eu countries . 
  for pratical reasons yes , but theorical no . 
  you are confusing the cause and causation . 
   the eu itself does not and should not have the power to grant eu citizenship to non-eu nationals . 
  wrong , because theorical it has the power . 
  in : http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/  any person who holds the nationality of an eu country is automatically also an eu citizen . 
  eu citizenship is additional to and does not replace national citizenship . 
  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  right now being one eu country 's citizen is the same as being an eu citizen , so that 's not relevant . 
  it 's about expectations . 
   ** google has demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results : ** rival comparison shopping services appear in google 's search results on the basis of google 's generic search algorithms . 
  google has included a number of criteria in these algorithms , as a result of which rival comparison shopping services are demoted . 
  evidence shows that even the most highly ranked rival service appears on average only on page four of google 's search results , and others appear even further down . 
  google 's own comparison shopping service is not subject to google 's generic search algorithms , including such demotions . 
  again ... 
  i think those guys that work at nokia have the capacity to develop phones and innovate . 
   the company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising . 
  from the article , maybe you should read it again . 
  i think nokia would be very happy with that situation . 
  this is not about promoting your own product , this is about preventing the costumer from using your competitors ' product . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation#european_union this paragraph explains nomenclature issues with the eu , but one thing is ceirtain , it 's a political union . 
  yeah the part where we have a parliament , a comission is just part of the `` illuminati '' union . 
  you really like to put words on people 's mouths , you should work for dm or the sun . 
  then you should stop saying that eu has something to do with your immigration . 
  did the media also voted in the referendum ? 
   are over-crowded and unrecognisable from a generation ago because of immigration india is not part of the eu . 
  it 's not the part of attending that really bothers me , it 's the speaking one , but i guess there 's people here that really like him to downvote me . 
  would be perfect if neither of those spoke . 
  an eu article in / r/europe ? 
  hmmm ... must be propaganda !, 
   in response to the european refugee crisis in 2015 , google volunteers started working with nethope engineers like llias to bring internet access to camps throughout greece and the balkan region . 
  the internet is a necessity for refugees and it gives them hope -- it means they can access information , educational resources and communicate with loved ones . 
   to support nethope visit nethope.org, 
   how long until a euro army marches against warsaw to enforce a ruling ? 
  you 're confusing how the eu works with how the usa works . 
  as for the rest of your arguments , treaties and contracts are to be respected , if not there 's punishment , whether it 's suspending the contract or boycott the other party . 
  since the eu is ruled most of the times unanimously , unless the country wants to attack himself ... 
  what could push for a irexit is the tax policy you keep practising that hurts all of eu members . 
  you just forgot about the part where many eu laws need unanimity and the council of europe ( which is composed by each country leader ) has all the power to do whatever they want . 
  the polls that are posted here from time to time are asked in a way that can be interpeted in vary different ways . 
  nobody wants to fight in the middle east but obviously it would be different if it was europe . 
  the map does n't show absolute but ** relative ** temperature . 
  the agreement for the military base on the azores was only possible by citing this alliance . 
  for the war itself , it was the will of the english that we remained neutral . 
  it was the english that did n't want us to join . 
   some merit to what austria is trying to do talk shit while knowing the efforts are already being done by the eu ? 
  the only limitation of price that there is is about the charges between companies , so they do n't extort themselves . 
  ok , but that 's in the national sphere , not the european one . 
  yes , but that 's a national policy , not an european one . 
  the only thing eu is forcing is to companies not discriminating national data from `` foreign '' data . 
  the eu is n't forcing the businesses to change prices , that 's their decisions . 
  in portugal no one has changed prices . 
  what 's happening in northern countries is the sole profiting of fear . 
  well , the logical conclusion is that you are getting screwed over by your companies that only care about profit . 
  do n't you have laws in your country that protect you against breach of contract ? 
  if you signed a contract they ca n't change the prices just because they want . 
  unsustainable rates ? 
  man , please , there were various links to official websites of both the comission and parliament of the eu with many faqs and other press releases . 
  go see them . 
  you will see that the rates are mentioned in the agreement . 
  maybe you should open a private business yourself and put the prices you want , 
  only if you live there . 
  check the official site of the european union to see the requisites . 
  it 's the companies of the user that pays for the bill , nevertheless there 's some written rules in order to keep the prices reasonable . 
  talking about portugal , the costs wo n't go up , the competition is good amongst providers and i 've heard no one say that they will hike up prices ( it would be a bit of a suicide ) .
