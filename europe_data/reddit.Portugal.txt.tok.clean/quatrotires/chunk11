   forces nice joke , go look at the financial demonstrations of tele companies and see how big their profits are . 
   why not make it cheaper now ? 
  how ? 
  you want the state to intervine in private business ? 
  he said he did n't agree with the arrest , and neither do i , but let 's not pretend it 's just a random book . 
  it 's like going to germany and showing off `` mein kampf '' , it 's obviously not the same as showing a 007 book . 
  no need to downvote a guy just because he says a fact . 
  lol , i though he had some rant about islam , but no , it 's just some sort of a joke . 
  you guys better turn away from that shitty authoritarian state while you can . 
  [ do it ] ( https://giphy.com/gifs/24xrxrdclxht2/html5 ), 
  so it 's their fault that they got attacked by russia ? 
  you know they are still fighting on the borders right ? 
  it 's not like ukraine does n't have an army . 
  because like i said , the countries where they came from are n't cooperating with eu , they are not helping to identify their own citizens nor are they taking them back . 
  which is why the eu had proposed for a boycott against those countries . 
  actually there is , there is n't state help if it 's he 's not a refugee . 
  this is some next level shit haha, 
  were n't you defending the soverignity of countries ? 
  i thought ukraine was independent when they lunged for eu/nato membership . 
  just because he can stay here while his application is rejected does n't mean he get the same rights of a refugee or a country citizen . 
  so you do n't want to provide them with food and shelter , you want them to leave . 
  to where may i know ? 
  i do n't think you noticed but they dropped everything to come here , they are here for their safety , why would they return to a warzone ? 
   you could try taking away all the incentives for them and return them to where they came from . 
  that was suggested by the eu , to make a boycott to north african countries but what national governments said ? 
  my sovereignty !, 
   it 's important to go after the ngos for people trafficking also , and discourage the italian navy from bringing them to europe . 
  does all of that sound reasonable to you ? 
  obviously there needs to be put brakes on some ngos but the italian navy is n't just bringing them to europe , they are following international treaties that say you have to give aid to drowning people . 
  it 's not like italian people like having a grand load of refugees in their small villages . 
  but the asylum process takes years to complete and most of them are in a warzone . 
  oh so you want them to starve to death , do you have russian ancestory or what ? 
  i agree with your comment . 
  i 'm not in favour of most refugees staying here after war stops , we do n't have any moral obligation to shelter them in time of peace . 
  for me the best solution would be to solve the problems at the source , but seeing the shitshow that 's going in those regions we all understand that 's not possible . 
  there 's a process that 's done after you ** apply ** for asylum , just because there are many people trying to come illegally does n't mean we have to deny basic human needs to those who are real refugees . 
  you do understand that these people are fleeing from a war , right ? 
  a permanent offer to leave / return their country is n't something they want when their country is at war . 
  detention camps ? 
  they already exist and they are ** over the capacity ** , that 's why there 's a need for quotas . 
   and yes , if this plan breaches international treaties , break them with glee . 
  that has always lead to positive outcomes . 
  you 're right , eu is not some kind of charity organization , to be able to receive the funds you have to abide by the rules . 
  the source of the virus is in the middle east , and for what i know not italy or greece control any territory there . 
  so ... failure to control borders ? 
  what is your suggestion ? 
  let people drown or invade north african countries so they take back the refugees ? 
  yeah because that will make them go back ... 
  because it 's so easy to stop the flow , what are your suggestions ? 
  disregard for international treaties that state you have to rescue people that are drowning or to create diplomatic trouble by `` dumping '' refugees in north african countries ? 
  it 's in the european solidarity where italy and greece do n't have to do all the work for 27 countries because they do n't want to help . 
  no , they want to distribute them on everybody else because italy and greece are not some kind of sheep that have to sacrifice everything while you sit there watching and collecting eu funds . 
  teachers lied !, 
  more info from wiki :  the school of sagres , also called court of sagres ( in portuguese escola de sagres ) [ 1 ] according to some historians was a group of scientific portuguese personalities and techniques related to ocean navigation of the fifteenth century , formed around the infant enrique , nicknamed the navigator in sagres near cape st. vincent , the southwestern end of the iberian peninsula , in the algarve . 
   while it is proven that the nearby port of lagos they weigh anchor numerous expeditions of exploration and colonization along the african coast and atlantic islands , ** the existence of the school of sagres has been questioned by some historians , [ in the portuguese version it says more assertively ] ** all historians agree that at least since the death of prince henry ( 1460 ) , the driver of the portuguese discoveries center was lisbon . 
  so are they gon na make the game good enough for me to come back or will it just continue to be a game to rich whales sustain their business ? 
   of power hungry eu yeah , since the eu is a movie producer it 's really just another power grabbing from the eu ... / s, 
  because we were never been part of spain . 
  and we do n't need it , we have the eu as a framwork to cooperate together . 
  that 's why in galicia it 's taught portuguese and here it 's taught spanish . 
  well , the reason we are not a province of spain was because our founder king wanted territories and to loot . 
  unless catalonia wishes to get back to medieval times i do n't think it 's a valid reason . 
  so what 's the reason ? 
  the companies already have big profit margins . 
  you implied that they are n't working on the issues . 
  at least they have to hide the bribes . 
  why the hell does the eu needs to change it 's policies just so the uk can be satisfied ? 
  i 'm getting tired of this exceptionalism uk , it was a mistake since the beggining but there will be no more special deals from now on . 
  because eu is evil / s,

   the standard political voting makes no sense that 's the reason we won , if it was for political voting we would have lost like we did the last 53 years .

  that 's uk . 
  is netflix not available in france ? 
   cannes is n't there for netflix business model i though cannes was there to promote and spread movie 's quality , but apparently it 's not the case . 
  i think it effects more on being preventive than being to actually pick the trash , it 's more about creating awareness . 
  just because they have many meetings does n't mean they are influencing , in the light of recent crackdowns it 's pratically the opposite . 
  the lobbyists are required so the eu meps and commissioners know what they are discussing and what are the industries concern , it 's not even close to the plain bribery that happens in the us . 
  in the us they get you elected , in brussels they are called to give their not binding opinion . 
  go ask apple how that went . 
  plus one here , although i did n't really enjoy much of it i sure did like to cook it , 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
   what is keeping the eu from doing it ? 
  the member states that do not agree / have other interests with a veto power . 
  yes , i know . 
  the meps are elected the same way your parliament members ; the eu comssions is `` elected '' the same way your government is and the council of europe is elected by each of us when we vote for our pm = government . 
  production limits and subsidies come from the begining of eu 's history , i do not agree much with them but they are there to regulate the market . 
  deflation is just as bad as inflation . 
  but i think this problem of the market and the inequality problems ( developed vs third world ) is a issue bigger than the eu that needs to be solved . 
  but what matters the most is that the eu is composed by its member states , whether the decisions are bad or good , it 's the member states that elect those people who decide on eu 's affairs . 
  i agree with that , but that 's why many eu projects are aimed to eliminate the differences between underdeveloped / developed regions and countries . 
  the eu is n't perfect and europhiles know it , but to dismiss it like it 's bad is wrong . 
  many of eu rules and regulations aim for the protection of the consumer but we should be grateful that someone looks for the citizen instead of looking like it 's bad to demand a quality product from companies . 
   i 'd much rather be given half a fuck about from dublin than not given a fuck about at all from brussels . 
  maybe you prefer the british treatment that scotland and northern ireland gets from westminster . 
  if you looked at the erdf plans you would see it 's the eu that cares more about the underveloped regions instead of the central national governments . 
   should we abandon our nationality ? 
  country laws and independence because someone threw money at the government ?
