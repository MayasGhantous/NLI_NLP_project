  usa is a country with states which is different from having a union of countries . 
  unless we become a federation i do n't think the unanimous agreement will drop . 
  no , the eu has always been giving veto power to every member state , it just happens that the belgians decided all regions had to agree on the deal to give a yes to the eu . 
  it 's no business of the eu how the belgians delegate their powers . 
   the only reason this happened is because of brexit . 
  the eu commission wanted to show how democratic it was and now it has backfired . 
  because the eu is also the belgian government / parliament that gave the veto power to wallonians lol / s, 
  technically it was a nation that vetoed , wallonians by themselves have no power in the eu . 
  i know it 's kind of sad to see that we ca n't make an agreement but looking by the positive side it shows that we are all respecting each members decisions and not sticking something on others ' throats . 
  i have heard of ceta but it was never broadcastly explained to the population , and for me right now anything that sounds like ttip is bad until i know more about the trade deal . 
  the thing is , we replaced our internal borders with a giant border surrounding the eu , so it means that if something gets in a country there 's no way to stop it from going to another , and that 's why ** we all have to agree ** with trade deals . 
  it 's not in the eu sphere of influence to decide whether or not wallonia has to agree , it was the belgian state that gave the option of veto to the region become a veto for the country . 
   why can a regionoal parliament representing 3.5 million people derail a trade agreement for the whole eu of more than 500 million people . 
  because the belgians decided that their decision of vetoing the agreement could be made by the decision of one region . 
  it 's not a failure from the eu but from the belgian state for putting the nation 's decision to the fate of a region . 
  since english is an official language of ireland it will keep being an official language of the eu .

   the news : the european commission in december proposed to establish a new agency -- designed to meet the new challenges and political realities faced by the eu , both as regards migration and internal security . 
   the european border and coast guard was agreed by the european parliament and council in a record time of just 9 months and will become operational as of 6 october 2016 at the bulgarian external border with turkey . 
  the new agency will ensure union standards for border management are implemented at all external borders ; carry out periodic risk analyses and mandatory vulnerability assessments to identify and address weak spots ; be able to draw on a rapid reserve pool of at least 1,500 border guards and a technical equipment pool ; play an enhanced role in return operations . 
   the background :  the establishment of a european border and coast guard is a key measure under the european agenda on migration to reinforce the management and security of the eu 's external borders . 
   president juncker has stressed in his state of the union speech the need for the eu institutions and the member states to work very closely together to quickly set up the new agency . 
  according to the bratislava roadmap a full capacity for rapid reaction of the european border and coast guard should be ensured before the end of the year . 
   moreover , the strengthening of the protection of our external border will contribute to create the confidence needed to restore the full functioning of the schengen area , according to the back to schengen roadmap . 
   the event : thursday 6 october 2016 ( exact time to be confirmed ) : official launch of the european border and coast guard agency by commissioner dimitris avramopoulos at the bulgarian-turkish border , followed by a press conference . 
   `` car-free day '' takes place on 22 september , in which street ( s ) are closed to cars and open to people .

   let 's hit the road & imagine a day without a single death on the road !, 
   today we celebrate the european day without a road death ( #projectedward ) during the european mobility week ( 16 -- 22 sept. 2016 ) . 
   the eu is committed through the road safety programme which seeks to halve the nr of road deaths & reduce the serious injuries caused in road traffic accidents till 2020 . 
   for every death on europe 's roads there are an estimated 4 permanently disabling injuries such as damage to the brain or spinal cord , 8 serious injuries and 50 minor injuries .

   and then write-off on their american tax form , which essentially shorts the us treasury of $ 14 billion it was n't the eu that made that law , do n't blame us lol . 
  you 're not understanding the point he made , the deal about `` forgiving '' taxes is illegal so the ec ruled that apple must pay those taxes from years ago , so it means apple is going to pay the taxes that were forgiven , correcting the mistake retroactively . 
  it 's those taxes that were forgiven that will be deductible in the us .

   victims of - isms should either be remembered together or separately . 
  why ? 
  because you want ? 
  no , thanks . 
  the reason it 's grouped together it 's on the european comission 's statement :  on 23 august 1939 , nazi germany and the soviet union signed the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  it marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in the recent history of our continent , bringing with it the deportation , torture and murder of tens of millions of people under totalitarian regimes . 
  while the end of world war ii marked the defeat of the nazi regime , many central and eastern europeans continued to suffer under other totalitarian regimes . 
  because there are eastern european states who were immensely damaged by stalin 's regime ? 
  my country is fortunate enough to be far away from that shit but go ask to the baltic states and others in the eastern part of europe . 
   while conveniently forgetting other - isms , in no particular order - ( japanese ) militarism , maoism , colonialism , imperialism , capitalism , etc. 
  what the hell does japan has to do with an european day for victims of stalinism and nazism ? 
  or colonialism , imperialism ? 
  maosism even better , that 's really familiar here in europe . 
  capitalism ?
