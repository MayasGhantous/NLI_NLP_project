  it 's just that consumers prefer to travel by car than train . 
  just because it 's used more does n't mean it 's more economic . 
  / u/morpheuspt posta ai uns mapas de portugal !, 
  source ? 
  just another thing to be envy about norwegians . 
  pls come to portugal irish police ( and judges btw ) !, 
  portugal and spain are pro-eu atm . 
  i think it 's 4 years apart for lisbon but apparently it 's every [ year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tall_ships%27_races#years ) on different cities . 
  p.s : loved the video . 
  we are already in the european union where we collaborate with them . 
  that 's another topic which the op was n't mentioning but is a problem that the eu has to address . 
  [ fortunately it 's all good . 
  ] ( https://euobserver.com/tickers/134504 ), 
  i think it 's not very wise to push for independence when you belong to a union that pushes to erase differences between countries . 
  what about the crusades ? 
  educated people from russia are n't fleeing a war . 
  no he 's just tired of hearing arrogant brits . 
  image 12 is where ? 
  it says france but there 's another french building after it . 
  those were really cool . 
  the staring game and class were on point . 
  unfortunately i 've never danced the polonaise in my school . 
  i 'm sorry if we are not the kind of people that bomb middle east all the time . 
  any suggestions ? 
  in portugal it 's against the law if the bus has n't seatbelts and you 'll be fined if you do n't use them . 
  the atlantic ocean, 
  / r/conspiracy, 
  did n't understand what you meant by that . 
  east timor was a portuguese colony and it 's great to see they like us . 
  is it possible to go all the way up there to see the city ? 
  i expected more on france . 
   e.g. 
  by making incompetent civil servants nearly impossible to fire , by making it too risky to hire people well , there are already people protesting in your country to prevent a law like that to pass . 
  even in east timor at 6:30 am they celebrated our victory ( this one not by portuguese emigrants but by east timor population ) . 
  quick question : how is german close to dutch ? 
  do you guys in germany understand a dutch like a portuguese understands a spanish ? 
  i said it was his doing and it was needed someone above average to stay out of ww2 but we are just getting in a conversation that will not lead to anywhere . 
   staying out of the war was n't some sort of masterful diplomatic maneuvering on his part . 
  i think you 're making a big understatement . 
  i do n't know much about russian 's history but i do know that salazar was good in diplomatic and economic issues . 
  but in no way i 'm saying that his ruling was good for portugal , because if it was my choice i would prefer to live poor and free than a bit more richer and tortured / censored . 
  actually he was the one who recovered portugal , it 's just bad that he needed to do that in a dictatorship . 
  [ eu citizenship ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/ ), 
  where nigel farage , boris johnson , marie le pen and donald trump have their meetings . 
  not all people that are marching because they want to ignore the results of the referendum . 
  many just want to protest against the leave campaign lies and some just want to show the rest of the eu that they are pro-eu . 
  people saying this march is undemocratic is so ironic .

  first time doing something like this , do i have to pick the country before hand or when i join you ? 
  just look at the reaction of the man at the right of farage : https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/747730290294980608, 
  translation : ** interviewer ** : how do you see this decision and what will be the future ? 
  ** woman ** : look , in first place i respect the people 's votes . 
  in second place , today i woke up feeling persona non grata in this country . 
  after working so much , pay taxes , i still continue to pay the taxes and there is that idea that the portuguese - i am talking about my people i do n't need to mention others - that the portuguese are all here to receive benefices , that 's just bullshit , that 's just propaganda , there 's many people here working and contributing and all their lives contributed to this country . 
  now the politics [ sic ] it 's a politics that we all now how it is . 
  they want [ sic ] , this is all about immigration , nothing else . 
  because if you go on the subway at 5:20 am you do n't see not even one english to do precarious jobs . 
  they are foreign kids , illegal colombians , illegal brazilians , portuguese , spanish , and other people [ sic ] poles . 
  it 's those people who do the work . 
  ** interviewer ** : we heard ago that the president of portugal marcelo rebelo de sousa lamented the situation and guaranteeing support to the portuguese . 
  do you believe in this support to the portuguese ? 
  ** woman ** : look , i 'm going to say one thing : professor marcelo even though he 's not my colour [ political party ] i respect him very much . 
  and i give a warning to [ prime minister ] ant\u00f3nio costa and the portuguese government to treat better the people and not tell them to emigrate like [ previous prime minister ] passos coelho told them . 
  because the reason of the emigrants have to leave their land [ sic ] because no one wants to be out of their land , i would rather be in my country with my sun than being in this country , i almost never see the sun . 
  it 's almost like being in a prison . 
  ** interviewer ** : do you fear a replica of this brexit in other european countries with the their exit from the eu ? 
  ** woman ** : look , i think this is a great bullshit , and it 's going to have big repercussions in all the people , the economy , in many places not only here . 
  and the proof is that the scottish voted to remain , the bigger part of the londoners voted to remain and this means that there is a riffraff of english that voted because they can not see the emigrants not even in the bullet 's law [ expression ] . 
  ** interviewer ** : one of the english 's arguments is precisely the overcrowding of the city with schools and hospitals full . 
  ** woman ** : poor things , what a pity i have for them . 
  then get up at 4 am and go to work to occupy those positions . 
  the day they do that i do my bags and i leave . 
  this is what all i have to say , nothing more . 
  `` it was always going to happen no matter what '' boris johnson, 
  i think it 's a legal vacuum but i guess an unanimous vote wold suffice . 
  when will be the elections ? 
  i fully agree with you but i get a bit sad thinking about being so harsh on the young generation that voted remain . 
  it 's the only thing that keeps me from wanting uk to get screwed . 
  because it 's `` impossible '' to have nice things , so why bother persue them ? 
  let 's go to war instead !, 
  so that we can finally stop the eu as a scapegoat target . 
  but there might be people that voted no to eu but would vote yes to ireland . 
  i wonder where we are heading . 
  are we going to return to 1935 ? 
  no , they do n't . 
  we ( portugal ) could be even better if we made good use of eu 's development programs . 
  our fault that we did n't make good use of them . 
  [ the fields of athenry by paddy reilly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr1rzssmsac ), 
  instead of complaining to the eu maybe you should complain at those companies that hiked the price . 
  i do n't understand it . 
  who said it 's working ? 
  i never said that , i only said that there were plans to be more agressive towards north african countries but they failed because members states did n't want to sacrifice their `` sovereignity '' in dealing with 3rd party nations . 
  actually there were efforts from eu politicians to get the member states to unite and have more leverage against north african countries but i guess the efforts faded away when brexit came . 
  well i 'm in an argument defending my ideas ... 
  so what law did the eu break with greece ? 
  obviously , if you will not be in the eu you wo n't have to pay your fees ... 
  or you respect the treaties you sign or you do n't . 
  it 's a natural dictomy . 
  i agree you leaving is good for further integration but that also means that uk was never in the spirit of making things better in europe . 
  i agree with you in almost all your argument , but i think it 's in cooperation in eu that they will be solved .
