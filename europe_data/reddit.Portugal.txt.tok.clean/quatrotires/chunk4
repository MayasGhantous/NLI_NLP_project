  people have also fled my country but i do n't think it 's fair to simply stop the others from having an opportunity . 
  those who flee should be deported by not complying with the european authorities . 
   sounds like italy and greece should have ~ ~ better border control ~ ~ ** let people die in the sea ** ftfy, 
  germany is the most populous country in the eu so they have a big number of meps in the eu parliament . 
  also they have more money and economical health . 
  the problem with greece , spain and my country portugal is not that we have the euro , the problem is many people think they are smarter than the rest of the population and decide to not declare their income so they can save on taxes . 
  it just creates a cycle of `` he does n't pay why should i '' and it 's unsustainable . 
  then obviously we all blame the eu , like it 's their fault that the politicians ( elected by us ) that received the funds decided to use them on their friends ' companies to exchange favours . 
  well instead of sending farage and co. to the parliament you could use your 73 meps ( 3rd most ) to propose deals instead of being rejecting every pro-cooperation agreements in the eu back to back . 
  that 's because the ones already here are all in italy and greece who ca n't handle them all at once . 
  but hungary and poland do n't understand what solidarity means and let greece and italy do all the hard work . 
  those striped houses are characteristic from costa nova , aveiro . 
  i have one pin in my fridge with those houses .

  well i do n't think that being rich gives them more rights than me , what matters is that we are all citizens . 
  we live in a democracy not in an aristocracy . 
   if you 're sad that rich people get better faster healthcare then maybe you should stop being poor . 
  they get better and faster healthcare because they go to the private sector . 
  they receive the same treatment of the poor in the public system . 
  because you responded to my comment of the representation of the population . 
  so you are saying that only educated people should be represented ? 
  it 's representative of it 's population , if you 're sad the rich ones are the most populous maybe you can promote fertility in the poorer ones . 
  eu meps already said numerous times that the 4 eu 's principles are only negotiated together so unless the uk accepts them i guess uk will have to build it 's relationship with eu from the ground . 
  if they decide to take the 4 principles it 's not much of a brexit as was expected from their voters . 
  it 's going to be all up to the negotiations . 
   ** claim ** norway and switzerland have to accept eu laws despite not being members in order to trade with it . 
   ** conclusion ** this is about right . 
  both norway and switzerland keep out of some eu activities , such as the common agricultural policy . 
  but they bring many of their laws into line with eu rules , on the single market in particular . 
  norway incorporates single market rules as they 're made , while switzerland accepts eu law from time to time in return for more market access . 
  what you think is a good deal may not be for us . 
  we act how we want and not how you want us to . 
  for you free trade is something that matters the most about the eu but for me and many others it is n't . 
  it was the uk that wanted separation with the eu not us . 
  talking bad things about people you do n't know the slightest . 
  this guy is a role model for the human race whether you agree with his politcs or not . 
  why do you have to make it sound like we are blackmailing you ? 
  should we accept all your requests without considering our own interests ? 
  they did it because of eu 's law , they just wanted to antecipate and pass it as their initiative . 
  he 's suggesting to only give new numbers in eu format . 
  the reason for degaulle was britain was a puppet of usa . 
  yes , but i 'm talking about the `` suggestions '' for other languages . 
  i do n't understand why people in this thread including op think that there 's a de facto language chosen by the eu . 
  officially the eu uses all 28 languages by using translators , the only reason there 's many texts in english is because it 's the most common one . 
  and do you buy your education ? 
  when he said europe he meant european union . 
  could you please discuss the message instead of being picky ?

  i do n't think it 's the officials fault that not the media or people care enough to even think about them .

  thanks to uk they will be contained to london . 
  thanks for the sacrifice , 
  that 's why we like the eu , where consumers  corporations . 
  if you think the eu is a big side for consumers ' rights you should search about roaming for example . 
   am just against extremists like verhofstadt who want to cut national sovereignty and turn the eu into some sort of continental empire . 
  quite ironic to say other people are `` ultra partisan '' when you make a extreme comment like that . 
  it 's ok to criticize the eu , the majority of those ( including me ) that are very pro-eu know that there are ** many ** things that need to change . 
  for that argument of power , it 's far from the truth since eu has close to 0 power against it 's own member states , as seen by the current crisis in poland about human rights and corruption . 
  i recommend you to download or order [ how the european union works ] ( http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/how-the-european-union-works-pbna3212336/ ) and to explore the other publications of the eu bookshop to know more about how eu works . 
  in the video he 's seen translating a document in the computer .

  a flashmob is always organized . 
  what ? 
  do n't twist my words . 
  the text was `` unite or perish '' , and in that context it does mean in the author 's words to regress and to go to times of disunity which leads to war . 
  i do n't care if you think the message is right or wrong .

  eu has been trying to unite countries to have more leverage against north african countries but as long it 's only the mediterranean countries they will continue to not engage in cooperating with the eu . 
  the argument of two extremes is a reality check with an hyperbole / metaphor . 
  perish is n't used in a literal way , in this context it 's used to mean a regression ( contrary to progress ) . 
   the main problem is , that the leading politicians do almost nothing against it . 
  but those politicians are ** not ** eu politicians !, 
  french policies about north african immigration and english policies about commonwhealt immigration are not in the sphere of influence of eu parliament . 
  eu institutions have no power to dictate how member states work . 
  that idea is the same of how nations formed . 
  it 's just on a larger scale . 
  the problem in his argument is the part where he thinks we 're going to make sure there is no 3rd option .

  but we many people in this thread are taking his comment literally and are missing the 2nd part of the phrase .
