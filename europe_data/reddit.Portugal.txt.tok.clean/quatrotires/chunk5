  it was n't lost in translation but the problem here is that people take it in the literal form and do not see the metaphor . 
  multiculturalism is n't creating a barrier between molenbeek and the rest of the country . 
  the fact that these migrants did n't integrate is the reason for the lack of multiculturalism . 
  it 's the fault of those who immigrated and did not seek to integrate and those who opted for the easy path of permitting them to seclude themselves from society . 
  no , we just do n't want to be the only ones paying forr development in the uk . 
   you know that saying ; people do n't know what they 've got whilst they have it . 
   the eu is the single most ambitious project in history ; and for all intent and purpose it does an extremely good job at it . 
  sure , empire is all over written , probably in the alternative news . 
  sorry , i had forgotten you were a troll , no more feeding . 
  yes , but the eu is n't an empire . 
  normal is putting a normal fine and then add compulsory taxes ( ? 
  ) , which is like interest until they pay it . 
   the soviet union was more diverse ffs . 
  maybe because they are in 2 continents ? 
  i do n't think india has 2 thousands of years of constant fighting , in which 2 world wars were hosted not less than decades ago . 
  i do n't think going to space is more ambitious than uniting 28 countries that were in constant war . 
   and the eu was willing to take him who said that ? 
  the negotiations are made to ** improve ** a country so they are near the level of the eu member states . 
  if there were no negotiations my country would probably be in a dictatorship / chaos and many eastern european countries would have a lot of corruption . 
   i just hope turkey wont be accepted to eu . 
  so far it seems that in this issue eu has it right so far , the negotiations were stopped thanks to that crazy man who rules turkey now . 
  1st of all it 's a bit enraging how the brexit side has put a twist in claiming that turkey is even close of joining the eu in the near future , when there 's only one closed chapter and they are doing it since 1987 . 
  2nd , the negotiations are good , that 's what makes countries become better . 
  it happened with my country ( portugal ) and it helped with a lot of eastern european countries . 
  it depends where you live . 
  if you had an authoritarian government you could n't cross the border without a good reason . 
  he 's a known fascist in / r/portugal , do n't feed the troll . 
  it 's about all of us . 
  it 's about unity which obviously has an implication on the elections of each member state . 
  it 's not just about the dutch, 
  because they are as human as us . 
   i thought the deal was that rich eu countries get access to poor eu countries ' markets in exchange for cohesion funds . 
  you thought wrong . 
  what out for smaug . 
  you 're just telling ad nauseum that for americans it 's not that way when for us europeans it is . 
  since it 's we that say how we work i think there 's nothing else to argue . 
  but we all have eu citizenship . 
  why ca n't we have the same laws as you ? 
  we already told you that if you do n't drop the law that discriminates the eu we will apply the same condition back at you . 
  the eu is to be seen to 3rd parties as a single entity , that was one of the reasons to create it . 
  that 's why canada had to have belgium 's yes to ceta . 
  we are giving you reciprocity . 
  but the fact is usa can still make agreements with countries for visa free travel , but those visas will only be in effect for that country , which means you wo n't benefict from the schengen area . 
  please learn [ how the european union works ] ( http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/how-the-european-union-works-pbna3212336/ ) before spreading false claims . 
  lack of public transport -- although large cities like new york and chicago have good public transit systems . 
  small and medium sized town often lack adequate public transport systems . 
  from [ wolters world ] ( http://www.woltersworld.com/destinations-2/usa/ ), 
  i was talking about the quality , such as delays , comfort , money needed ... 
  we also have cars in europe but public transportation is better . 
  it 's better because of traffic , environment , you have more time doing something else . 
  i could drive my car to university but it 's way easier to go by train + subway . 
  does n't agitation on the water helps the oxygenation of it and increases the amount of fish ? 
  maybe you should stop being rude , you would n't get downvotes . 
  i thought you wanted more sovereignity ... 
  what i 've heard is that you do n't have good trains / subway systems . 
  i 'm talking about 55 + where you ca n't get a job because no one wants someone that old , and you ? 
  i 've seen some la traffic footage but i do n't really know the general state of traffic in usa . 
  is it really bad or it 's just a hyperbole for most of the cases ? 
  if you think that americans are the biggest source of turism in europe you can start by actually learning one or two things about europe . 
  that 's also a problem you have : public transportation . 
  search up the motto of the eu please . 
  so if you are too old to get a job those 3 months wo n't suffice . 
  for the severence pay , we also get it , as it 's legal required . 
   even american politics is huge in europe it 's not just american politics , we care about being informed unlike ignorant americans that do n't even know what karneval is .

  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  we also claim he was portuguese . 
  eu parliament is n't that important if you compare it to national parliaments . 
  i think it 's more usual to visit each state and only go to european instituitions when there 's some deal being made . 
  you 're being downvoted because you are making false claims . 
  ** quantity ** is n't the same as ** quality ** . 
  you know that was our king that gave independence to brazil ? 
  multicultural does n't mean that muslim culture should be the majority in a neighbourhood ... 
  wow , powerfull pictures . 
  if the us would n't make lies about europe we would n't have the necessity . 
  where is this ? 
  it 's better than many , like mines :(, 
  refugees are treated the same as refugees that go to other european countries . 
  but the question is much about refugees but about our way of life , we are tolerant and peacefull . 
  looks like [ brendan gleeson ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322407/?ref_=tt_cl_t4 ) drank too much . 
  if you come to reddit to find self-posts to be news you 're in the wrong place buddy . 
  you should learn how the eu works then . 
  maybe instead of builind those 12 lane motorways you should invest in public transportation . 
  rip right headphone, 
  i think it all depends on how we handle the situation . 
  if there 's no hope in their home country it might be difficult to make them go home . 
  obviously some will stay but if the processes and integration are done sucessfully we could always deport them by force ( if needed ) , as long as they are n't in danger anymore . 
  you need to pick a dictionary and read what democratic means . 
  yeah but i associate more the amsterdam 's canals with a river than an aqueduct . 
  that does n't invalidate my point , unless you tell me not only three did that . 
   vodafone have been giving it away on new contracts . 
  that 's because they would have to give it anyway . 
  every operator started offering free roaming when the news came out that the parliament was and the comission were working in that direction .

  but why you say we are allowing droves of people ? 
  unless you are talking about ** refugees ** and not immigrants . 
  and if you are going to say that many ` refugees ' are in fact immigrants i tell you that 's why we have an asylium process . 
   undemocratic a referendum is undemocratic ?
