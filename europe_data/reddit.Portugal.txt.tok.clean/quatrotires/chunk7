  yes . 
  just like how you vote for your pm . 
  did n't know we had to say how private companies manage their business . 
  they are suing so they can get their families brought over to germany not to get free money . 
  people like you are disgusting human beings . 
  context ? 
  * cough * galicians * cough * xd, 
  just because we like multiculturalism does n't mean we like assholes disrepecting our laws . 
  what i like about multiculturalism is being able to meet all other european nationalities and learn about eachothers countries . 
   the belgians make stone versions of naked little kids pissing out water they must have learned with italy . 
  the only thing i know about them is that they do n't know how to behave between themselves because they all hate eachother . 
  and guy verhofstadt was their pm . 
   how only in the 19th century did the concept of nation emerge as the unifying force by liberals . 
  the concept came later but that does n't change that we 've been a country since 1139 . 
   we can argue that portugal showed it had a quite old national consciousness even in the late 14th century but it 's wrong to suppose nations are a natural and immediate construction . 
  i agree with that . 
  one might say it was only in the 1943 , when the pope said we were a independent kingdom from spain . 
  but the point of the question is that we are a 877 year old country , which i believe we are . 
  we can look at other european countries that had a process of unification or segregation , but portugal was always the same . 
  the elites on those countries are already rich and it 's not like we really have much influence as we would like to have . 
  but the eu politicians are campaigning for more power to the eu so they can have , as a bloc , more leverage towards those countries . 
  that was just changing the way we rule . 
  but the country / kingdom portugal was always there even when the spanish king ruled us . 
  if it was n't a nation in 1139 when was it then ? 
  unlike other european countries we did n't change . 
  i 'm appalled . 
  and those north african countries ** do not ** accept these immigrants , so unless you want to break their sovereignity you ca n't do nothing . 
  and we already have a deal with turkey to stop the flow in there . 
  i do n't have the idea that you love national governments , i just find funny that you 'd think that the same electors would elect different kinds of people . 
  2016-1139 = 877 years a nation, 
  i do n't think so , since it was one of the key facts that was brought by the ` no '' side during the campaign . 
  i agree with / u/slyscorpion , just wanted to give this little know fact . 
  you must be seeing another thread then . 
  he changed jobs . 
  just like a manager changes team . 
  it 's impossible to not laugh at your comment , do you think the eu was made by aliens or what ? 
  if you think eu officials will differ much from eu national officials you might need to look how those are elected . 
  it secedeed from mexico to join the u.s. 
  you 're just showing your ignorance towards europe , confirming even more the bias that your flair carries . 
  most of us were against scottish referendum because it would mean they would be leaving the eu , now we want them to have independence so they can stay in the eu . 
  if catalonia decides to leave spain it 'll be leaving the eu as well . 
  check my flair please . 
  did n't know that the 5th element was french , that was a surprise . 
   while filmed in english , it is a french movie yeah , i said that it 's not much french because the characteristics of the movie are more american than french , do n't you think ? 
  thanks  if you could recommend some german movies as well because i do n't see them too often .

  just because eu policies do n't come from the night to the day that does n't mean they do n't come . 
  maybe you should visit the european parliament and european comission websites to know more about the eu . 
  you must have missed the part of building an eu army and it 's objectives . 
  it 's not just the eu that is inefficent with the deportation , it 's the national governments that do n't want to give power to the eu have more leverage towards the african countries that reject the relocation of the immigrants . 
  they are n't really extremists if you look at the usa or our european neighboors . 
  there 's not much political uncertainty here , the elections were recent and we , in contrary to the global trend , elected a president and a pm that are the extreme opposite of a extremist . 
   why are white homogenous european countries peaceful ? 
  you sure ? 
  because many are n't peaceful at all . 
  do n't you need to do military service to have the gun ? 
   an european that oes exacly the same job as i do , uses the same coin as i do . 
  makes 4 times as much as i do , then gets to come hero and enjoy a contry he does not pay taxes too . 
  while i strugle to pay rent . 
  there are many other countries in the eu where the situation is the opposite for you . 
   how is that european equality for you ? 
  whats the point of the eu then ? 
  make it cheaper and easier for north europeans to get a summer vacation ? 
  no thanks i rather they pay full price if they are going to fuck me in the ass . 
  at least i feel more worth it about it . 
  we already are net receivers from the eu , we get money because we are poorer than the rest of the eu . 
  what you are saying is a complete lack of gratitude to those who pay their taxes that contribue to our country . 
   also comparing with other contries that the times . 
  portugal was doing quite well , even under the salazar dictatorship it was growing 7 % a year , since the eu it has been bailed out 3 times . 
  we were growing because we were in ashes , the state of the country was deplorable . 
   the habillity to enter and do business as they wish you have that hability too . 
   to get control over the coin trough the ecb because it 's really bad taht we have a common currency that makes life easier for everybody . 
   and control over quotas our actions do n't just affect us , it affects the world . 
  unless you want to eat money in the future it 's a good thing we have quotas . 
   and borders what a pain in the ass being able to travel freely to other 27 countries . 
  / s  fuck me i rather just pay more taxes to fund the projects my self . 
  nice joke . 
  many projects are funded by ~ 80 % of funds from the eu , and it 's not in the order of hundreds or thousands of euros . 
  is there any good documentary on those events that you recommend ? 
  i tried with the facebook post but it did block me so i screenshoted . 
  i must ask you though , why do n't you accept this content that comes from trusted sources of eu politicians ? 
  the portuguese emigrated en masse to paris and i 've never heard of any problem that the portuguese did to the french . 
  i was being ironic . 
  i want to know when was portugal rich after 1700s . 
  because we were always poor , with or without the eu . 
  and the tourists enjoy their best life in our country because they pay for it and they worked for that too or you do n't have vacations ?
