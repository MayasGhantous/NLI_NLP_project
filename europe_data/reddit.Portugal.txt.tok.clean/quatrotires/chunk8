  you ca n't compare the mexicans with syrians , mexico is not at war . 
  and mexico shares a land border with you , a refugee coming to europe is risking their lives at the sea . 
  not letting them come is the same as killing them . 
  but do you think there 's something wrong with you for them to stop you from going there ? 
  there are 28 countries in the eu , if only 5 use those tools it does n't really have an effect on those countries . 
  russia was easy to be dealt because all eastern european countries fear russia ( history , etc ... ) but they can pretend that what happens on the mediterranean countries is n't something that affects them as long as they shut their borders . 
  this is n't about federalism but about the european ** union ** . 
  and we can not deny that the eu is being `` attacked '' by nationalist movements . 
   their neighbors mostly are : moroccan , somalian , turkish , albanian , nigerian , afghani and so forth . 
  these people tend to not speak the native language or know the culture nor do they care to learn it you forgot the english . 
  we do n't have to give up , it 's just that not everything is black or white . 
  this is why we should be thankfull there 's peace in our continent . 
  it 's not like it 's the elites of those countries that are going to suffer . 
  and they would be more refugees trying to cross the mediterranean . 
  i 'm curious about what you think of the decision of united kingdom to stop polish immigrants . 
  it 's really easy to dismiss others ' problems but when the story is on reverse ... 
   after being rescued those people should be on the next ferry back where they came from . 
  but the country they came from does n't accept them . 
   apparently no one high up thought and who 's that person ? 
  eu ca n't do anything because they do n't have powers and national governments have the powers but are divided in 28 fractions . 
  with a parachute right ? 
  the problem is that 's also another way to make things worse for that country and creating even more refugees / immigrants . 
  why should the bank be forced to loan ? 
  germany has a superavit . 
  what your country does n't do is share the burden that greece and italy have . 
  i wonder what 's your solution to the problem when the north african countries do n't accept them back , do you want to kill them just for asking us for help ? 
  i understand not all of them are good but i do n't see a better solution . 
   some of the most successful countries in the world through virtue signaling and extreme liberalism are adopting all of the douchebags and terrorists so their countries do n't want them back , what are we going to do with them ? 
  throw them to the ocean or just kill them all ? 
  yeah , the balkans were always very peacefull and the ex-soviet states . 
  but the problem is that the smugglers are out of your jurisdiction and unless you want a bad diplomatic situation we ca n't do much . 
  unless we do what was stated by guy . 
  yeah , but consensus is always difficult and that guy could break your special deal with the third country . 
  for example , my country portugal mantains special ties with the colonized countries , we have special trade deals with them , it 's not hard to imagine that my country government would have some reserves to giving the power to eu . 
  altough i support the transfering of power to the eu i can see why there 's obstacles . 
  just because germany has a big economy does n't mean those countries are dependent of germany . 
  is it wood or plastic ? 
  that tree is yuge . 
  seems like a lol champion, 
  probably has to do with boycotting together these countries . 
  do you think this refugee problem is a national problem or a european problem ? 
  and who is getting blamed for this problem at the moment , is the national or european politicians ? 
  lol . 
  it 's kinda of imposed by the majority of the people , that 's what you want to say . 
  but forced refugee quotas are n't there to help the refugees , they are there to prevent italy and greece from caring for all refugees . 
  the quotas are a measure that comes from the principle of solidarity in which eu was created upon . 
  it 's ** our ** choice , and you do n't have to live with it , you can travel wherever you want or campaign to change the political landscape . 
  if it 's hard or close to impossible ? 
  yes , but that 's because you 're a really small minority that wants change . 
   feudalism had `` highest standard of living '' in it 's age why are you saying that ? 
  feudalism is n't really a choice , it 's kinda of imposed by a king and it 's army . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  because the member states have to at least comply with the treaties they signed .

  full text :  the berlin attacker was shot and killed today in italy . 
  his case is a painful reminder of two things : the weakness of eu information-exchange policies and the consequences of a complete absence of eu 's return policy . 
  anis amri was a suspect of terrorism . 
  although his asylum request had been rejected by germany , he kept moving freely in europe as tunisian authorities failed to cooperate in issuing the papers for his return . 
  we must bundle up our return policy on eu level with appropriate capabilities -- as suggested in our migration paper . 
  that way we will increase our leverage over third countries , return refused asylum seekers and make asylum policy work for those who really need our protection,

  just because they do one thing does n't mean they ca n't do the other too . 
  youth unemployment is being discussed so i do n't see why are you complaining . 
  you 'll soon join us . 
  but what makes you think that countries in coastal africa will accept those migrants ? 
  husband of the murdered pm jo cox . 
  that 's because some eastern countries like hungary do n't want to accept some refugees and aleviate the burden of italy and greece . 
  so should we let them all crowd in greece and italy ? 
   then they should start by letting us vote directly [ elections to the european parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_to_the_european_parliament )  and not let big companies have influence to the european parliament you must be kidding us . 
  the biggest defender of the european consumer right now is the eu , you must be confusing with national governments . 
  did n't know that non-eu citizens pay the eu taxes .

  i ca n't even express how envy i am . 
  fado ;, 
  it 's just a temporary measure . 
  lisbon - 60 $ for metro + train, 
  i do n't think that educating and share knowledge is awaste of taxpayers money , but maybe that 's because i 'm an `` expert '' . 
  did n't they send you an email with the order link and password ? 
  i do n't know if it 's the case with this specific magazine but when i ordered something from the bookshop the order status is `` open '' and a few days later it gets `` shipped '' , so i believe it 's not an automatic process . 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/latest-press-releases.htm ( not newspaper but it 's good since it 's a source ) https://euobserver.com/ https://www.neweurope.eu/, 
   and if those researchers dissent or provide a differing opinion other than what they were looking for they just cut their funding this is the type of misinformation that makes people call you ignorant and gives you a good place on / r/conspiracy  the laws created by the same bureaucrats . 
  the same people that create laws in your national parliaments are the same people that create laws in european institutions . 
   and no the eu has like one mechanism to control their institutions so what is the [ ombudsman ] ( https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-ombudsman_en ) ? 
   that 's the central bank run by draghi the fiscal dragon . 
  they use that to pay everyone and anyone that shills their worldview and conforms to their rules and regulations . 
  again , that things belong to / r/conspiracy unless you give at least an argument , it 's not enough to say that x is evil just because you have a prejudice against them . 
   edit : i 'm not saying that the eu has n't given us europeans good things . 
  i 'm just saying that the more trust we give them the more faceless they become and they become less and less accountable to their constituents . 
  they have to be held on a tight leash and once in a while put back into their places . 
  elect the good ones and you do n't have that problem . 
  and it 's always the national governments that fuck the shit up . 
  the council of ministers is n't much the same as the comission and parliament that had the idea for the law . 
  that 's the same that we should n't have difamation laws because free speech . 
  i do n't think there 's anything more objectively than scientific studies and the law . 
  what the eu press presents is not opinions or clickbait titles , but the simple truth of what the law says .
