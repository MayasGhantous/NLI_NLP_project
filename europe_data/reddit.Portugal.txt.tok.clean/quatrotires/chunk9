  and eu has many mechanisms to control their institutions . 
  eu websites and press releases are not corporate media . 
  research instead of demanding things that are already in place . 
   ( not some fucking somali going welfare shopping ) across borders , reinforcement of outer borders do you watch the news on the eu or you just like to spit misinformation ? 
  also chief negotiator of brexit . 
  i think it goes for most eu countries . 
  difamation , fraud and other things may get confused with freedom of speech but we should be able to know the difference . 
  read the article and you 'll know why there are decimal numbers . 
  no , i think the reason is that there are different dates according according to whoever recognized the independence ( one of the most important is the papal declaration ) . 
  that 's not the independence . 
  indeed , i do n't agree with the author about our low proficiency in english , i rather think we are above average in terms of speaking a foreign language . 
  in the article the author presents how the information was gathered . 
  read the disclaimers . 
  read the disclaimers . 
   good . 
  nothing else would be constructive . 
  i think it 's the opposite of good , just look at the exemples of bees and ants to see what are they capable of doing when they work for the community first and not their own interests . 
  because the eu makes sure that the funds are done for their specific reason . 
  - everything ok ? 
  - everything ok , and you ? 
  - everything ok . 
  but those eastern europeans are european citizens since they joined the eu . 
   then an act of war may be warranted that 's really what we need !, 
  it 's about fact-checking , not censoring . 
  they are relocating them and trying to integrate people in european countries , but those who are n't willing to integrate are being sent to countries that will accept them , because yes , you ca n't just send them like the african country is going to accept them and thank you . 
  and you have the example of the agreement with turkey to stop refugees coming to europe . 
  to be continued ... 
   `` lets allow millions of economic migrants from africa and me who will fragment our society , bring social/racial tensions of unknown proportion , all because we are not racist stopped reading here . 
  go to the european comission website and read what eu politicians say about the refugee / migrant crisis instead of reading the sun or the daily mail . 
  have your heard about the fundamental freedoms of the eu ? 
  games are produced by studios , companies , which are located geographically in a country . 
  why put the white category if we 're talking about age ? 
  it 's not the young people that are voting for right wing politicians . 
  it 's the old ones . 
  it 's bad that it 's on position 202 along with foreign news channels in portugal . 
  and we get oliven\u00e7a back !, 
  portugal is really cool in this map . 
  in portugal we learn english for most of our school years and french for 2-3 years . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i just said that the biggest benefict for the uk is the access to the open market , but to many countries that 's not the biggest benefict . 
  then you thought wrongly . 
  it 's a political and economic union , which indeed englobes free trade but much more . 
  if you only want free trade you can follow norways ' example and join the single market . 
   i 'm all for economic free trade zone ) . 
  because that 's the benefict to your country . 
  that 's why everyone hates british exceptionalism , we are not going to do only what is good for you , we are not here to work for you . 
   there are other countries beside the eu with which us can trade . 
  same goes for the eu . 
   it took the americans , brits and rest of the anglos are n't you forgeting no one ? 
  because pretty much the majority of the eu countries fought against the axis , not just the anglo countries . 
  you should check out the other games , i enjoyed a lot the one about discrimination in neighbourhoods . 
  [ mods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4znu82xhe ) jk it 's good to see we have mods that are n't radicals in all their decisions . 
  that 's because they go over your country , but how many of that border is in percentage compared to yours ? 
  you have a border with russia , if that does n't mean you are eastern european there might be something wrong . 
  relevant : [ european comission take on youth \\ ( un \\ ) employment ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=1036 ), 
  nice way to save . 
  maybe for comparing between poor countries but we 're comparing between developed countries . 
  gdp does n't measure quality of life , which i think it 's what better describes success . 
  hdi should be used to compare success between `` rich '' countries . 
  and with hdi you also have one that adjusts to inequality , so in 2016 usa is on # 19 in the inequality-adjusted hdi . 
  since when does gdp equals success ? 
  portugal and spain can into eastern europe , 
   - it won eurovision this year ** triggered ** -, 
  so in portugal no party with seats in the parliament is anti-eu , does it mean we 're 100 % pro-eu ? 
  today i saw this site to understand more of the events , i recommend you to do the same : http://www.warsawrising.eu/, 
  must have sucked to be the 1st guy, 
  step 2 : ** depression **, 
  spain as other website that 's similiar to reddit but it 's in spanish , do n't remember the name tough . 
   nearly the whole world exageration much ? 
  first of all , the eu says that there is ** no evidence ** based on the test they had made at the time . 
  second , you can read what dirk jacobs said , that ** legally ** these products are different products and that 's why they ca n't be compared . 
  give me a link where someone that belongs to the eu said it was not true . 
  probably the 135 upvotes . 
  it 's not only them seaking help and treatment , it 's nurses searching for them and giving them supplies every week . 
  i think it 's not only the decriminalization but rather the help the social workers and health staff give to drug addicts . 
   well it apparently mattered a great deal when it was fewer women in universities that 's because they were forbidden from going to university . 
  give rights to people . 
  yeah , we should burn all the books !!, 
  and chase some people , probably . 
  since it is the eu bookshop i would be very confused if it was n't pro-eu . 
  we should help first because we 're human beings , and second if you do n't help those people they wo n't stop existing , and desperation makes people do things that should n't be done . 
  yes , it 's a problem , but it 's not like there 's many viable options that do n't include helping those in need . 
  obviously it is a problem , how can you think that people fleeing from war is not a problem ? 
  the reason it has continued to be a problem for so many years it 's because there 's not an easy solution , and without the cooperation of north african countries it 's even harder to tackle the issue . 
  there was already a problem with refugees before 2014 , you just did n't care enough . 
  maybe when some russian tourists decide to take some vacations in finland we can say , good , take it all and leave the rest of europe alone . 
  so much for european solidarity ... 
  they do n't get deported but they do n't get the help the refugees get . 
  is being a member of the eu a right or a privilige ? 
  until brexit this sub was in favour of the remain at indyref . 
  those generals ( ? ), 
  were the people who i less expected to enjoy this show . 
  [ mods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4znu82xhe ) jk i understand the position of the mods , hope you 'll figure out eventually how to best handle the situation , 
  we need to invite them to eurovision . 
   uk is part of the eu it 's a special deal . 
   they 're from europe what the hell are you talking about ? 
  do you think it 's people from europe that go to somalia , ethiopia and every other broken place to smuggle people into europe ? 
  stop regurgitating what others say and start informing yourself about the world . 
  libya is just a coastal country that serves as a passage , not the origin . 
  the smugglers are not in europe , that 's why they are n't being arrested .
