the russians do n't understand portuguese culture otherwise they would n't bother with this kind of intimidation since no one in portugal will have a fuck to give . 
  they 're expecting a visit by the confidence fairy january 2015 . 
  flying long range bombers into eu airspace ? 
  if that is so , then why is russia doing this ? 
  hungary has gone full retard . 
  this guy is retarded , we 're in deflation and he wants to further aggravate it with debt write downs and bank collapses . 
  qe is exactly what we need , the core 's inflation will be higher than in the periphery helping the adjustment , debt will be paid , and everything else will fix itself . 
  good , i fully support any country in europe opposing russia . 
  portuguese people just love to stare at anything they are currently deciding to disapprove ( i say currently , because portuguese change their opinion on what they disapprove weekly ) . 
  i 'm not gay or do gay stuff , i have been looked at disapprovingly many times for a bunch of other reasons , i find that 54.3 % number actually low . 
  religious people are idiots . 
  i have long stopped trying to find logic in what idiots and crazy people do , it 's just not good for my brain . 
  lol fine . 
  i 'll just leave this here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bussaco the french actually have this battle in their arc de triomphe as if they had won . 
  our monarchy fleeing is in fact embarrassing , but the topic says '' ** successfully ** invaded '' , they did invade , but it was not successful . 
  they invaded but they did n't conquer anything and in fact they were defeated with the help of our british allies . 
  the monarchy not risking it is not surprising . 
  the french invasion of portugal was ** not ** successful , in fact , it failed 3 times . 
  this was not by chance . 
  this happened right after the european parliament demanded that they release the estonian citizen they kidnapped . 
  shows how much they respect europe . 
  pretty sure those 25 russians were being oppressed !, 
  when they saw the russian coast guard they quickly yelled - help , i 'm being opressed !, 
  the heroes in the russian coast guard promptly reacted . 
  so , wait a minute , this guy actually thinks putin should be able to rule over what happens to ukraine ? 
  i do n't think i 'm playing word games at all . 
  i do n't know a single person who uses muslim as a reference to a set of ethnic groups . 
  maybe that 's just a portuguese thing , but we never use ` mu\u00e7ulmano ' our word for muslim for that , we have other words that do n't imply a specific religion . 
   i am not a religious person , i am rather an agnostic and i am not really interested in any religion , so ... you 're ** not ** a muslim in germany . 
   european parliament says release estonian citizen not eu citizen . 
  one ca n't understate how stupid this was . 
  i 'm sorry but that kind of looks like shit . 
  this is how [ you 're supposed to do it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0juu0us.jpg ) ( like we do in portugal ), 
  you think cabo verde has great beaches ? 
  try s\u00e3o tom\u00e9 e principe , it 's a fucking paradise . 
  i agree with jogeid . 
  we call the spanish `` nuestros hermanos '' in daily conversation . 
  yes there are rivalries , and yes spain should probably split up , it does n't mean there is n't a sense of brotherhood and shared history/culture . 
  am i retarded for only now realizing they are called dacia because that was the name of a roman province that was placed where romania is today ? 
  can someone photoshop a museum worker censoring the ugly painting on the right of this photo ? 
  it 's too much for even my extremely handicapped artistic sense to bear . 
  well , if i was estonian i would kidnap russian `` spies '' and suggest a trade . 
  you guys need to try `` pedras salgadas '' then . 
  i really think it 's probably the best carbonated water in the world . 
  it has the smallest bubbles and it tastes amazing . 
  http://aqua-amore.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cpath=227 i do n't know how to buy it in germany : /, 
  lol it 's just a matter that , for us ( luckily ) nation and state coincide , so there 's no reason to be separatist here or in iceland . 
  it 's ludicrous to even suggest it even if they could reach it , the record holding sniper shot is 2475m and the target was n't a fast moving plane . 
  to think you could hit a plane 10000 meters high , several times , and take it down with bullets is just insane . 
  there 's no need for further evidence , you have to be retarded or a liar to claim russia has n't invaded ukraine by now . 
  everybody kills hitler on their first trip . 
  ca n't we shoot putin or something ? 
  well given that this has become pretty much a debt ( public and private ) crisis , i would say this is a hell of an important indicator . 
  how can you expect the economy to pickup if no one is spending because everyone is paying down debt ? 
  they are n't doing * fine * , however they have deleveraged a lot more than we do . 
  that certainly puts them in a better position than us . 
  no i do n't think she 's evil , she just only cares about germany , because that 's where she 's elected . 
  well sweden and poland do n't use the euro ... 
  so you have an explanation right there . 
  as for denmark and the netherlands they are n't doing well at all , they have been in recession until quite recently , and they are neighbours to germany , which is an advantage since they have a market that is n't doing that bad close to them . 
  i would n't base them on anything fixed , there would have to be a federal budget and then it would be a matter of politics , sometimes federal assistance to state budget would make sense , for instance , if a state is getting deflation . 
  well , they are quite obvious , we need to either breakup the euro or go full fledged federation with fiscal transfers . 
   it is because countries inside the eurozone have made mistakes . 
  sure , but thanks to the euro , they have no sane way to recover from their mistakes without getting into a self defeating deflation spiral . 
   why ? 
  there are more than enough countries that do fine . 
  the entire eurozone is stagnating , how is anyone doing fine ? 
  even germany is starting to feel the effects of this idiotic policy . 
  obviously what needs structural reforms is the fucking eurozone , obviously - again - the germans are reluctant to admit that as they 're the main beneficiaries of the current status quo . 
  i agree , this is retarded . 
   ukraine does n't mean anything to her . 
  ukraine or any other country in europe . 
  good , maybe the ecb will be able to do something now , we have been facing deflation , not low or reduced inflation , but actual deflation , for months now . 
  starting to really hate the euro . 
  yes , but this dude is a professional , he knew what he was doing , he evaluated the risks and chose a minimal risk trip that would give the children a slight glance of what real war is . 
  i do n't think most people should do it as you need to know what the fuck you 're doing . 
  i do think it 's great parenting . 
  of course they need it . 
  this gives the west an excuse to not react until the deed is done . 
  ohh it was an invasion ? 
  i 'm sorry russia totally fooled me with the red cross convoy thing . 
   when the majority of the country approves of his actions no one can challenge those actions even if they are clearly wrong , against democracy and secularism . 
  that 's not exactly true , this is why you 're supposed to have a constitution that prevents this kind of stuff . 
  our current majority government for instance , was unable to do dozens of actions they wanted to do because the constitutional court did n't allow them ( and i even agreed with some of the measures they did n't allow but the constitution has to be respected ) . 
  i do ? 
  when spain was an imperialistic neighbor that threatened us , we did n't want nothing to do with them . 
  that 's why you have boats . 
  finland was irresponsible to become so dependent on such an unreliable trading partner . 
  that said , there are a lot of ways a country like portugal can help even if not monetarily . 
  for instance , we have a lot of experience with quite different trading partners than the finns . 
  we have experience in countries such as brazil , angola , mo\u00e7ambique , etc. 
  we can help the finns get into those markets quickly and help offset the effects of the russian ban . 
  seriously , this is on europe 's border , how can we be lapdogs if its in our own interest to stop the russians here ? 
  i am as far away from russia as you can be in europe and i ca n't imagine us not taking a stand . 
  i guess we have a long tradition in europe of looking the other way until we 're actually being invaded . 
  luckily for the finns , many of the other europeans have a lot more empathy than they do . 
  what do you propose ? 
  the endgame is pretty stupid too . 
  all retired people move to the country next door . 
  zero retired people pay taxes .
