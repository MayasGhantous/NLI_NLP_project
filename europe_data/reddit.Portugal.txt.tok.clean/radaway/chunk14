  europe nowadays is nothing short of a marching cataclysm while we wait for this decision . 
  do n't worry , soon the troika will be governing you . 
  then , maybe you will remember why you wanted independence in the first place , and stop having idiotic ideas that for some reason slovenians ca n't govern themselves . 
   spinoza says that sadness arises from a disconnection from our poten\u00e7ia -- our power to act . 
  it is no coincidence , then , that the powerful use the language of shame to keep us impotent : unemployment and debt are the fault of the individual alone , they say , and social sadness a private affair . 
  `` sadness does not pay debts '' - ant\u00f3nio de oliveira salazar good job europe . 
  you make our last dictator seem modern . 
  does n't matter while the suffering is located outside frankfurt . 
  this is an incredibly important point anywhere in the world . 
  it should be equality of opportunities , not equality of opportunity . 
  that said , i 'm not quite sure how to prevent the banks from keeping tabs and this may have the perverse effect of the banks not wanting to loan to entrepreneurs at all . 
  ahh so we 're demonizing the italians now . 
  they clearly need more austerity and unemployment to lose that pride . 
  it depends on what you think are the root causes . 
  the root cause is not structural problems in the periphery at all in my opinion . 
  not that there were n't some problems . 
  the root cause is a very poorly constructed shared currency . 
  what needs restructuring is europe , the restructurings on the periphery are just sand being thrown in our eyes and not solving the real issue . 
  anyway , i 'm used to europe blaming everything but the euro , europe 's shitty institutions and economically incompetent direction . 
  we blame americans , evil bankers , lazy mediterranean people , money laundering cypriots , hft , etc. 
  we really have a knack for creating scapegoats here . 
   the hard choices we make now lay the foundations for a healthier europe when the tide turns you can not reasonably believe this . 
  how will a generation that never worked be ready to take advantage of any tide change ? 
  how will our indebted companies take advantage of any tide change ? 
  this makes no sense whatsoever . 
  if anyone is going to be ready to take advantage of the tide change it will be the american private sector which has been deleveraging much quicker than ours . 
  tldr - the ecb ca n't do shit because we are n't a real central bank , we will lower interest rates next week to make it clear we exhausted all options so maybe politicians will let us do something . 
  that 's not kidding at all . 
  it 's all fun and games until you get home and you ca n't put food on your table for your children to eat . 
  then shit gets real . 
  my house-finn is always trying to kill himself . 
  do you have any tips to keep these little guys happy ? 
  i play with him , take him for walks every day , and my household has no debts , so i 'm not sure what i 'm doing wrong . 
  portugal may be too warm for them , or maybe this breed just needs to have a job and i should buy a sled and make him pull me to work . 
  you 're sort of right . 
  except for cancer . 
  fapping frequently is great for cancer . 
  who would have guessed that a populist campaign , by amongst other mr. barroso himself , building a shitty narrative for this crisis around calling countries pigs , their people lazy , ants and crickets , and other mother fucking bullshit would result in this . 
  how surprising it is that northerners think they 're paying for shitty countries of shitty people and that crisis countries think europe fucking sucks . 
   jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , the european commission president , said on tuesday this week the european `` dream '' was under threat from a `` resurgence of populism and nationalism '' across the eu . 
  you fucking cunt . 
  you and other prominent politicians spreading this bullshit were the ones who caused this . 
   i did n't misunderstand you , that was just the historical context . 
  which network should be state owned : ( old ) phone lines , cable , fiber , wireless , mobile ? 
  there is no single network . 
  in my opinion , all of the above . 
  you can include electricity and water networks too . 
   the concept of multiple owners for these networks is also fundamental to the free market and competition . 
  not it 's not . 
  what is important is [ unbundled access ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unbundled_access ) the best way to guarantee it is for the state to own it . 
   do n't buy into `` it only makes economic sense to build 1 of it '' , because that 's the opposite of what happened at both access and infrastructure level . 
  it 's not a matter of buying into it . 
  this is a fact . 
  it is a huge economic inefficiency to duplicate networks . 
  the proof of this can be seen in the us where they need huge investments in network infrastructure and have 3rd world internet because the networks owners have no incentive to upgrade since they have no competition . 
  you are , perhaps , misunderstanding me . 
  i am saying the network should be state owned , not the operators . 
  the state would have no monopoly in providing telecommunications over it . 
  you can regulate and force the network owner to offer unbundled access to other operators but there is always foul play . 
  the concept of unbundled access is fundamental to the free market working for networks since it only makes economic sense to build 1 of it . 
  since you would need a regulator to watch over just 1 network , and you will need to have the expertise anyway , it makes much more sense to just own it . 
  this is why networks should be state owned . 
  pahahaha please tell me the translations are true !, 
  if they are i need to get bulgarian tv on my cable . 
  not necessarily . 
  it really depends on how you choose to do it and how the stimulus would be done . 
  from my experience trying to reason with european gold bugs , this is not a matter of logic to them . 
  it is sort of a religion . 
  you see , they ca n't understand how modern money works . 
  what they can understand is how to do their grocery shopping budget . 
  so they choose to believe the world works the same way so they can convince themselves they understand it . 
  this is like trying to explain to someone who believes the internet is a series of pipes what dns is , or how internet routing works . 
  you ca n't . 
  he is too ignorant for you to explain it too him , and too convinced he has a good enough metaphor , that he does n't need to learn more to grasp things about the internet and have an opinion about it . 
  yeah because countries and companies going bankrupt will be great for your pension funds . 
  unemployment also great for your pension pyramid scheme . 
  banks stealing deposits , great for your savings . 
  lower wage , great for your savings . 
  less clients great for your savings . 
  no , actually it can only do the last one , and it 's easy to protect myself against it . 
  you realize you completely contradict yourself . 
   because when you print more money you make the existing ** money more worthless ** , and so the money you just printed only has a temporary effect . 
  printing money will ** increase ** the debt since debt is also denominated in that `` money '' , logically printing money reduces debt . 
  since i think europe 's biggest , and maybe only , problem is excessive debt by both private and public sectors . 
  i think this is a great idea . 
  godwin 's law of economics , confirmed . 
  who cares about inflation ? 
  you know what 's eating my savings ? 
  unemployment - competing with desperate zero profit bids in everything i do . 
  you know what 's also eating my savings ? 
  my clients having no money because they ca n't deleverage in such a depressed environment . 
  you know what 's also eating my savings ? 
  huge tax increases . 
  you know what 's also eating my savings ? 
  banks stealing my deposits . 
  i have a very long list of things that i 'm getting instead of inflation . 
  i 'm not happy with the tradeoff . 
   we just print more money ? 
  why not ? 
  err , who 's we ?
