  and we have actually sold a huge amount of electricity at 0 euros to the spanish because we had way too much . 
  this goes to prove that we installed way more wind power than we should have . 
  the human is already being discarded , just not totally . 
  in many fields you now have software and technology that allow people to do a job it took 10 people to do before . 
  in those instances , you have in effect already discarded 9 out of 10 humans . 
  not all fields have this ratio , but it 's rare to find a field where a few humans have n't been discarded yet . 
  i 'm not saying we will have a real human like ai in the next few years . 
  all latest developments seem to show that it wo n't be necessary , to automate most stuff , anyway . 
  i 'm a software engineer too . 
  what sector in the service sector are we talking about ? 
  we thought self-driving cars would be close to impossible . 
  we can now do it . 
  soon there will be a huge chunk of service sector disappearing right there . 
  i think a good clue that we are close in an area is when you have applications that are very good assistants to the people doing them . 
  in cars , you had gpss that gave you directions , all sort of electronic driving aides , etc. 
  before you got the self-driving car . 
  i think the self-driving car is an extremely good example because it shows how automation can slowly emerge from small advances in each component . 
  i see lots of service sector professions that are now in the same state as the self driving car . 
  they have a bunch of software and small gadgets assisting them . 
  its a matter of time until they discard the human . 
  i see it in marketing , linguistics , lots of design work , accounting , healthcare , many engineering fields , etc. 
  i see it everywhere really . 
  i 'm not entirely sure that analogy can be made but its an interesting point to think about . 
  btw i think most service sector jobs will be automated too . 
  it 's just a matter of time . 
   there is more value in the service sector than in manufacturing maybe that 's why we 're in a crisis . 
  i 'd love it too . 
  i just would like to hear it from someone else than the `` bailin model '' moron . 
   if i wanted to simulate a bailout programme in programming , it 'd be a ton of `` if '' statements within other `` if '' statements and a lot of the variables would have to be randomly generated ( within a certain range , likely using % 's ) because it 's unknown how people react . 
  each `` reaction '' would have a certain effect on the rest of it . 
  it would turn out differently each time it was run , just as it does each time one is implemented ( in relation to the assumption you have to call it `` fuzzy logic '' so it looks respectable and people pay you money for your `` bailout simulator '' . 
  not at all , quite the contrary . 
  however , the portuguese are , by nature , very mild mannered people . 
  so really , you do not see unrest anywhere . 
  massive social unrest ? 
  wtf . 
  this is totally not true . 
  no one is happy with what is happening , and there are big protests now and then , but , massive social unrest is , for now , a huge exaggeration . 
  one of the worlds biggest economic powerhouses ? 
  they do n't need to do what we tell them , it 's not like we 're going to invade , but it may be in their best interests to do so . 
  the only problem i see is that the definition of what a tax haven is seems murky . 
  also , if we 're to go after them maybe we should start by cleaning up our house ( ireland , netherlands , luxembourg , etc ) . 
  anyway , i 'm not sure i am pro this measure . 
  i 'm just saying that in diplomatic terms we can certainly do it . 
  remember how in the middle ages , a time when christians could n't charge interest , everyone in europe started hating on the jews because they were the tax collectors and money lenders ? 
  the european union is the new jew !, 
  are n't both acceptable in the phrase as it is ? 
  i think what you wanted to correct was `` previously rented '' -  `` previously ** owned ** '' in which case you should keep the `` by '' . 
  if you 're slovenian this is the time to start seriously worrying . 
  all the bailed out countries ' pms made speeches explaining that they do n't need a bailout and how different they are from the last bailed out country . 
  that inflation prediction has been waiting to come for a long time now . 
  it will probably never come because as you say americans have a lot of debt to pay and they can just use the money to do just that instead of buying stuff . 
  which is exactly what they are doing right now . 
  americans mostly have their savings invested so they have nothing to fear from inflation . 
  a little bit of inflation , even 4-5 % is no demon and no problem . 
  as for that prediction that their growth will never come i do n't really see why . 
  if anything the american private sector is deleveraging much better than the european one . 
  like you say it 's the private sector that matters to grow an economy . 
  by contrast the european private sector is not being able to deleverage because they have to deal with deflation and unemployment . 
  when the upturn comes it is the european economy that will not be able to grow because of its private sector ** and ** public sector debt . 
  while the american private sector will be able to make america grow and , by doing so , fix their public sector problem . 
   we 're trading in short term pain for long term growth loool . 
  they will be growing exactly at the same time we will be growing - when this depression is finally over . 
  except their economy will be in a much better position to take advantage of the upturn because it was n't totally devastated by the economic crisis . 
  when the upturn comes , europe , with a few exceptions , will have an entire generation who has never worked decently for a decade , it will have very small companies incapable of competing with the global behemots , it will lack infrastructure and installed capacity to take advantage of the new opportunities . 
  it will be a fucking shithole . 
  it will grow and maybe become a shit pile . 
  europe is completely retarded . 
  indeed , you are right , you should trade short term pain , for long term growth . 
  in the middle of a great depression , short term pain , means allowing your budget deficits to grow and your coin devalue . 
  i find it amazing that 's still possible after 5 years of this shit . 
  anyone interested in buying my family 's home for the value it supposedly has ? 
  seriously , it will be great for your networth . 
  modifying cars is stupid and dangerous . 
  cars are designed , engineered and created by huge teams of engineers that have wind tunnels and do hundreds of tests with them . 
  everything in a car is made in a specific way to achieve a determined behavior . 
  now , some jackass decides the car should have a huge spoiler . 
  that jackass does not have a wind tunnel , that jackass does n't know how that is going to imbalance the car or weaken its structure . 
  will you be surprised if that jackass crashes his car on his next turn on the highway ? 
  seriously . 
  it is beyond stupid . 
  it 's a testament to the quality of modern car engineering that more accidents do n't happen even with the modifications . 
   `` europe would be infinitely better off if germany made a definitive choice between eurobonds and a eurozone exit , regardless of the outcome , '' he 's absolutely right . 
  lol why are we both being downvoted , this sub is so annoying at times . 
  anyway . 
  i certainly agree that new treaties are needed . 
  the fiscal compact was a supposed ( idiotic and unrealistic ) first step in that direction . 
   and , if i think so , you can bet that not only does several other northern europeans , but above all - the investors . 
  and , then they will loose faith in the euro , it will be used as the printing press for the south . 
  you and other europeans may think that way . 
  certainly not investors . 
  any investor would prefer to invest in countries where the central bank actually does its job . 
  you have an example of that in the us , japan and uk . 
  on the other hand , each time the ecb actually does its job , like when it said it would do whatever it was needed , and that it would buy bonds in the secondary market - the only thing that actually helped in this crisis by the way - austerity proponents take the corresponding interest rate decrease as proof that austerity is working so they insist extra hard in it . 
  so europe may be too idiot for shared central banking . 
  i agree with you that the rules must change , because they are stupid outdated and based in antiquated notions of what central banking is all about . 
  i do n't agree that permanent transfers and pooling debt is a definite solution , it is a good stop gap , but even if we did that , in the end the ecb would have to act like a lender of last resort for everything to work smoothly . 
  it should also target ngdp and unemployment and not only inflation . 
  i think they should pay the forced loans . 
  the rest i find it harder to justify .
