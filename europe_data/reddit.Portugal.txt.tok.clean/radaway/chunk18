  it was forgiven long ago . 
  a few years ago i would n't have imagined seeing the us give europe lessons on sanity any time soon . 
  to be fair , she was praising the good things thatcher had that i think anyone could praise . 
  the woman was totally fundamentalist when it came to trying to apply free markets to everything , but she certainly had some qualities . 
  i think it was also more acceptable to be that way in her time , the left was quite more fundamentalist too and quite dangerous . 
  of course that , trying to follow most of thatcher 's policies nowadays is beyond stupid ( particularly as some of them proved not to have the desired result at all ) . 
  everyone should have more nuanced opinions on how to do stuff by now . 
  we tried the extremes and they both suck . 
  it 's pretty much inevitable . 
  the reforms did n't have the desired results at all . 
  i think you forgot the most important thing . 
  less sand . 
  you ca n't have a civilized democracy when you have sand in your genitals . 
  basically it was made after our revolution , a time when communism was quite popular . 
  hence it has many things in it that were meant to instill communist principles to our democracy . 
  in the original 1976 text we could n't even privatize stuff . 
  do n't get me wrong , as someone who supports us exiting the euro , i would actually support this as a great first step . 
  the government could then accept t-bills as tax payment and in a very short time they would effectively be the same as a new currency . 
  it would n't even be a very odd measure as the imf commonly asks for this . 
  this news item does n't seem very credible though . 
   a ** person ** close to the government said it had mulled the idea of paying public employees and pensioners one month of their income in treasury bills , forcing them , in effect , to lend the treasury the money the court said it could n't cut from their paychecks . 
  a government spokeswoman ** denied ** that the idea was being considered . 
  journalism nowadays ... 
  the country is in a state of emergency , not because my government and i are incompetent and insisted on measures against the constitution without changing it first since that would be too hard . 
  it 's in a state of emergency because our constitutional court does his job . 
   but he accused the judges of creating extra `` fragility ... uncertainty and unpredictability ... risk '' and said that some constitutional experts disagree with their decision . 
  you incompetent douche . 
  you are the one creating extra fragility , uncertainty , and unpredictability . 
  they should have changed our constitution 2 years ago , they did n't , and thought they could just ignore it now . 
  wtf ? 
  i seriously dislike our constitution but this whole debacle was beyond ridiculous and a huge display of incompetence by both our government and the troika . 
  what 's sad in my opinion , is that we do n't even have a viable alternative to this bunch . 
  the biggest opposition party are the douches blocking constitutional reform because they 're more interested in getting in power than in the country 's success . 
  so they 're even worse . 
  fuck them all . 
  i agree with this translation . 
  this seems to be written by either a delusional person or a 1984 fanboy . 
   if anything , they should lower taxes and balance the budget with even more spending cuts - our unemployment problem is getting too serious right now it really does n't matter . 
  they can raise taxes or lower expenses , both will result in more unemployment . 
  we 're too deep in the death spiral to fix this . 
  correction : crisis can happen anywhere when debt is in a currency you do not control . 
  you really ca n't speculate that a country which controls their own currency will default . 
  neither does unemployment . 
  olli rehn please go kill yourself . 
  you are an idiot and the world is better off without you . 
  i think our constitution sucks too . 
  but , the job of the constitutional court is not to judge the merit of the rules in our constitution . 
  it is simply , to uphold it . 
  there is no scope where an elected government can do things against the constitution . 
  they have to change the constitution first not the other way around . 
  they also need 2/3s for that which they do not have and the opposition does n't want the changes so ( sadly ) it is clearly not in their scope . 
  i may not like our constitution but having a constitution , and respecting it , is fundamental to have a working democracy that does n't randomly fuck up people or minorities and i will not support anything that goes towards taking the constitution less seriously . 
   if germany or the eu had enough money on their own , and complete control , we would never had punished you so hard . 
  this is just not true . 
  europe could easily simply print the money . 
  quantitative ease its way out of this . 
  it just did n't want to . 
  they do n't really care about you guys . 
  this is a union only in name . 
  things are going to change if and when they start feeling it too ( and they will ) or when we break off from this stupid currency . 
  seriously , for them , it 's the same as watching a news item on some country in the middle of africa , asia or south america having financial problems . 
  their governments care only as much as their banks are exposed - no more - and their people could n't care less . 
  portuguese here , double and even triple negatives that are still a negative are quite common in our language . 
  we may not never be drunk . 
  you realize that bringing this up is just as ridiculous as bringing the nazi subject up . 
  it 's like the godwin 's law of economics . 
   stop blaming only germany for this . 
  i agree . 
  the blame for the current situation of europe is squarely on the shoulders of the germans , but also the dutch , the finns , the austrians and the imf . 
  they all insist on being neoliberal goldbugs and fucking europe . 
  motherfucking idiots . 
  if there 's one thing i learned with this crisis . 
  you can always get more fucked . 
  does n't matter . 
  what matters is the constitutional court soon to be decision on some of the measures on this year budget . 
  there is a very high likelihood that some of them will be declared unconstitutional . 
  if that happens it is possible that the government resigns or that the president will try some shit . 
  then we will be truly fucked again . 
  yeah they always say that but historically most countries defaulting do n't take that long to get access to the markets again . 
  russia , iceland , the examples abound . 
  sadly the markets are quite idiotic as they have a bunch of people in them . 
  so , if the media keeps throwing stories like this every day , things can turn for the worse quite suddenly . 
  since your country is in the euro it also has no way to protect itself against it . 
  http://pordata.pt/europa/precos+da+electricidade+para+utilizadores+industriais+e+domesticos+ ( euro + ecu ) -1477 i do n't know why the data i find only goes until 2011 . 
  i can tell you the prices for households are now slightly above the eu27 average . 
  slightly above eu27 average means extremely expensive for us as our per capita income is below average . 
  our renewable energy is not as expensive as it could be as it comes mostly from dams . 
  we 're are at 23 % here , do note that we earn considerably less than our nordic friends , so this is quite horrible for us . 
  we keep winning !, 
  new record every month !, 
   we still should n't leave the euro as printing money to both pay the debt lol if we left the euro we certainly would n't be paying no debts . 
  ** nowadays ** , it really is . 
  when you speak of privatizations nowadays , you are speaking of stuff that should really be in the hands of the state . 
  namely to ensure unbundled access in the case of networks ( electricity , water , communications ) or to ensure the , imho fundamental to our success , equality of opportunities in the case of health and education . 
  there is very little left to privatize that would not have perverse effects as the free market does not work without some given preconditions that are not present in what is n't privatized yet . 
   compsci majors were taking the same courses in intro-level programming in soft languages like html/css/php what kind of shitty compsci is this ? 
  you 're supposed to be learning theory of computation , algorithms , math , microprocessors , etc. 
  intro to programming can be done in say python or scheme , certainly not in php . 
  otoh this makes it easier to exit the euro as we are n't so dependent on fossil fuels . 
  portugal is actually very dandy and a great place to live .
