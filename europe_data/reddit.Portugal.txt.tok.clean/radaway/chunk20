  will make no difference at all . 
  you get the press like if you 're doing something - `` european union done right '' . 
  it 's true that this would be eu done right , this would be a way to provide much needed stimulus to the greek , german and really all of the eu economies . 
  it 's not really what it is , is it ? 
  it 's just a quite cheap pr project . 
  fuck all of the eu politicians and their constant shenanigans . 
  this is exactly what happened . 
  luxembourg knows what 's up . 
  it 's kind of hard not to get into a conspiracy theory mindset when the winners and losers of all eu decisions are always the same . 
  yeah the anger is totally unfounded , they 're just jealous schoolchildren . 
  a person or a company budget is totally different from a country . 
  ** unless ** as a country you are indebted in a currency you do not control . 
  which is why i think we should leave the euro by the way . 
   i expect countries implementing austerity to come out strong in the next decade they wont . 
  austerity is having a huge destructive effect . 
  it 's not destroying just inefficient companies it is destroying everything . 
  maybe they will grow after it , but it will take decades to be back where they started . 
   oh . . and i 'm the pro-eu guy , wait till you hear from the anti-eu dudes . 
  i used to be pro-eu guy . 
  can you honestly keep being pro-eu guy after watching how many fucks other europeans give that your country has just been obliterated ? 
  not only do they give zero fucks , politicians that caused this look better in polls at home . 
  so , if there are fucks to be given , it will be in your asses . 
  not the group of countries/people i 'd exactly like to be associated with . 
  europeans are just not very nice and they suck at economics . 
  actually , i still remember how , in the beginning , deluded but very important european politicians . 
  explained to us the concept of `` expansionary '' austerity . 
  funny how short of a memory people have . 
  its not that bad if you read that as brazilian portuguese . 
  to its knees ? 
  what an optimist !, 
  i 'm thinking more in terms of futurama 's head in a jar . 
  nope they should be miserable inside the euro for a few decades to pay for their sins huehuehue . 
  anyway , i think the only reason countries are n't leaving yet is that they keep putting the carrot of actually solving things ( banking union , stronger european institutions , etc ) in front of us . 
  the moment people stop believing that carrot is there , it will be an exodus . 
  i have to say that i have serious doubts about the carrot . 
  i think they 're just waiting to see if the situation just sorts itself out and they do n't need to do anything . 
  of course , it wont . 
  so we should just breakup already . 
  at this point we also have to consider that even if the carrot is really there , do we really want it ? 
  after watching how europeans talked about one another and how they treated one another during this crisis , i would say ** no ** to be honest . 
  for instance , we have just crushed , killed , assassinated a country . 
  most europeans did n't even bat an eye . 
  politicians keep using the `` they 're different and special case '' rethoric and it always works because european minds are so eager to think that way and confirm their prejudice . 
  it 's not just in economic problems either . 
  no one cared about actually helping france in mali . 
  you know , because it is ** their ** problem . 
  solidarity and empathy between eu member states exist only in the minds of a few idealists . 
  is that anything like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=b%c3%b4la&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=lz1suzaoa8rb7abcvogoda&amp;ved=0caoq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=709#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=b%c3%b4la&amp;oq=b%c3%b4la&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24l2.40636.40872.2.41894.2.2.0.0.0.0.128.227.1j1.2.0...0.0...1c.1.7.img.zezgwjgpbmk&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44342787,d.zgu&amp;fp=c0367e5875dd41a0&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=709 ) ? 
  i have suggested solutions many times before . 
  the comment you replied to may be just sarcasm , but maybe you should see what it was in reply to . 
  agreed . 
  not that we do n't need to promote a different narrative of what happened but this video sucks ass . 
  so brave . 
  it should n't be but , inside the euro standard , it effectively is . 
   you fully ignore the dealer 's point . 
  i think i have a balanced view . 
  people who think the junkie is the only problem are the ones that need to broaden their viewpoint . 
  i want the drug dealer to assume his part of the responsibility and work together with me in a framework that actually solves our mutual problem . 
  the current way of doing things is n't working . 
  well , not where i live . 
  we 're crashing way faster than the results from reforms can come . 
  we even tried to reform faster but apparently it only makes the crashing worse . 
  maybe what he could do , if he was the junkie friend and actually wanted to get paid , would be to defer the debt payments to a later date and meanwhile give him some methadone while he helps the junkie reform himself . 
  the methadone would keep the junkie from completely crashing and so better be able to reform . 
   the comparison between a junkie and a stern caretaker may seem offensive it 's not just offensive , it 's inaccurate . 
  if you want to make a comparison , i would compare it to a junkie and its drug dealer . 
  except the drug dealer did n't ever got paid because he stupidly continued to give drugs for free past the necessary to get the junkie addicted . 
  now he wants to be paid for the drugs he gave , so he is cutting fingers from the junkie because he is n't paying . 
  of course that , as the junkie loses fingers , he is less able to work to pay his debt to the drug dealer every day . 
  the drug dealer says to everyone - i 'm teaching him a lesson . 
  the `` overly emotional '' junkie cries - how can i ever repay him without fingers that 's our perspective . 
  if you had some empathy , you would understand it . 
  yeah we were told cyprus was a special case ( is n't everyone ) but now apparently it 's a [ model ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cyprus-deal-is-model-for-future-bailouts-says-top-european-official-as-banks-are-told-to-open-8548594.html ) , according to the fucking idiot dutch finance minister ( i 'm sorry but he is , just by saying this he fucked europe 's economy once again ) . 
   i disagree no you do n't  what we need is one set of standards . 
  and if they do n't respect them ? 
  then we need to not let them sell here . 
  domestic industries are not competing on a level playing field on things we think should be global concerns . 
  namely child labor , food safety and environment . 
  i do n't think this should be thought in purely economic terms . 
  you really have to be protectionist against countries not enforcing a minimum of rules on these subjects . 
  yes i was guessing they would be opened after said stealing . 
  pillaging the pension fund is not really a solution either if the objective is to reduce the total debt cyprus would be in since they would still have to pay those pensions . 
  of course they could always subsequently reduce the pensions like they did here and that was certainly the plan . 
  either way , they will need to pillage that pension fund and reduce pensions soon enough since their economy is pretty much gone after this debacle . 
  might as well take 100 % of it before it leaves the country . 
  i mean , as long as it is ok to steal people with more than 100k , better do it while you still have them . 
  it 's a graphic , i would n't call it an infographic as it seems its purpose is more to disinform than to inform . 
  otherwise they would n't have used the values on the circle radius to produce [ this effect ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dfnz2cx.png ) . 
  whoever made this , you suck . 
  we are in the euro and we are also experiencing deflation . 
  so it does n't look so good from my perspective . 
  it sure can . 
  football and '' [ telenovelas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telenovela ) '' . 
  fuck that shit . 
  in portugal the rationale is that they provide a public service having sports installations the public can use and promoting the practice of sports . 
  of course that as the clubs get more and more indebted they provide less services every year . 
  thread lightly . 
  without football to distract the spanish they will fucking kill someone . 
  are you telling me that during the dotcom bust ( that largely did not affect southern economies ) they lowered the ecb interest rates to save themselves and in doing that helped generate this crisis ? 
  no way dude .
