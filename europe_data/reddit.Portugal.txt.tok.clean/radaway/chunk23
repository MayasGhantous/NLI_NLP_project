  yes i 'm suggesting exactly that . 
  for one reason alone - austerity is not working . 
  we are n't any closer to be able to pay our debts , quite the contrary , we are farther from it . 
  all austerity and the troika loans have managed to do was to delay it . 
  in the mean time , during this delay , the effect their measures are having is highly destructive . 
  might as well do it as soon as possible , the sooner we do it the less crippled we will be and better able to weather the storm . 
  i would n't mind having some semblance of sovereignty again either . 
  austerity is n't oxygen . 
  it 's more like breathing co2 , it does n't kill you as fast as outright breathing co but it 's certainly killing you . 
  even if europe refuses to consider other options , austerity stricken countries must certainly consider the options they have as they are dying a slow and agonizing death . 
  frankly , right now , i 'm so disillusioned with europe , so sure , that all austerity is doing , is slowly destroying our economy and making us sell everything at low prices . 
  that i think a much better option is to completely default , exit the eu , and then start growing again . 
  it 's going to be horrible , but it 's better to do it now than after 5 more years of austerity destroying what we still have . 
  i say this because , since austerity is clearly not working , that will also be its end result . 
  better sooner . 
  better before we are even more crippled . 
  i 'm still not sure if he is a complete troll or if austerity proponents instead of asking for more time for it to work , or admitting they were wrong . 
  have actually turned into austerity denialists denying that it ever happened . 
  if the latter is true , europe is totally fucked , not only do we do stupid policies but we persevere in trying to do them ever more stupidly . 
  because , you know , we have n't tried ** real ** austerity yet . 
  it 's the [ no true scotsman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) fallacy applied to real world politics and quite scary . 
  no you deleted your own comments , only to later repeat them in this thread as if you had not learned anything . 
  i have already given you the numbers . 
  just follow the link i gave you to the thread where you deleted all your comments . 
  why did you delete them by the way ? 
  just so you could go on saying bullshit ? 
  dude , i have already proven to you in another [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19h7jw/portugal_socialists_say_enough_austerity/c8o0ufw ) , you decided to delete all your comments on , that we have been doing austerity , stop spewing your bullshit all over / r/europe . 
  dude , i 've already proven we are spending quite less , and that 's not even taking into account that our interest payments are much higher , so regular expenditure has decreased even more than it seems . 
  you can lead a horse to the water , but you ca n't make him drink it . 
  you clearly are not interested in ** facts ** that are not consonant with your warped worldview . 
  how european of you . 
  ahahah so now austerity proponents instead of asking for more time for it to work , have actually become austerity denialists , denying that it ever happened . 
  you 're ridiculous . 
  you moron we signed the deal with the troika in the middle of 2011 so austerity only started a bit after that . 
  particularly during 2012 . 
  maybe try looking at more than one source of data before saying bullshit next time . 
  conveniently picked years you have there . 
  you 've won a bag of dicks . 
  [ edit ] here 's a source showing we have been doing austerity since 2011 http://www.pordata.pt/en/portugal/search+environment/table/4470569, 
  not immediately worrisome , as we have a majority government , it is a coalition but it has been stable until now . 
  still , europe is getting ready to make another politically unstable country . 
  no one believes austerity and the current plan are working , no one believes in any of the parties in our parliament so our next elections are going to be fun . 
  the ecb already assumes we will need another rescue package so they know this is n't working . 
  the european comission thinks we will need another year before reaching our deficit targets so they know this is n't working . 
  wtf are we doing ? 
  why do politicians all over europe keep saying that it is working , that things are better and that the economy will pickup in 2013 ? 
  are they fucking out of their minds or do they think europeans are complete morons ? 
  it 's working guys . 
  it just needs a wee bit more time . 
  very interesting . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i wish we had that without the guilt part . 
  just the admiration/appreciation part . 
   also `` provocateurs '' . 
  bulgarian english is like human google translate . 
  [ * `` provocateurs '' * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agent_provocateur ) is french you dumbass, 
  there 's also such a thing as respecting democracy and in this case italian voters . 
  italians gave monti a resounding defeat . 
  monti was basically europe 's candidate . 
  european stupid policies lost an election and europe is butthurt . 
  europe ca n't even blame monti . 
  he warned europe again and again that if it did n't change course extremism and populism would be the result . 
  europe does n't care about reality so it did what it want . 
  no problem . 
  in europe we repeat elections until europe is happy . 
   stop sounding like an utter idiot and i will stop treating you like one . 
  if utterly simplistic black & white solutions like yours actually worked in real-life , people would be using them . 
  people have been using them quite successfully . 
  namely india and brazil have done exactly what i propose to pressure the pharmaceuticals to give them better deals . 
  i think you seriously overestimate how complicated the chemical processes to make most medicine are and how capable and knowledgeable the greeks are . 
   aaah , if only the world worked the way you kids think it does . 
  your idiotic condescension does n't make your argument any better . 
  classic european politician . 
  frankly if i was leading a country and pharmaceutical companies would not sell me the medicine my population needed at the price we could afford i would just tell them to shove their patents up their asses and make the medicine myself . 
  eh , history is not a good argument for europeans . 
  europeans are huge historical revisionists and denialists . 
  maybe because we have so much of it . 
  we are retarded that way . 
  the good side , it 's something we have in common with turkey so maybe we are n't so different after all . 
  the bad side , is that we clearly have no problem repeating ours and other people 's mistakes over and over , because , obviously , the situation is totally different . 
   perhaps an investment into the economy would have paid off more , but that takes time and is uncertain so austerity is the preferred method . 
  it 's not uncertain at all . 
  austerity is the uncertain method . 
  the other methods - investment and devaluation - are quite proven to work , they are just not possible in the euro straight jacket as you need control over your own currency and not having signed stupid deficit ceiling pacts for that . 
  europe has a debt crisis and inflating it away is not possible , it is also not possible to repay the debts since their interest rates are bigger than the economic growth , so we are forced to go on this slow death where periodically they will be restructured and we will be slaves to our lenders forever . 
  kudos to italy if they leave the eurozone or force it to change policies , the italians are absolutely right in not wanting to go down this road . 
  i do n't think history will be so kind . 
  i 'm pretty sure this time will be remembered as one of the most idiotic times ever , where imbecile european leadership ( not just by germany ) during the 2nd great depression caused immense tragedy . 
  i ca n't help making the paralel , and excuse me for the godwin 's law :  first they came for the greeks , and i did n't speak out because i was n't greek . 
   then they came for the irish , and i did n't speak out because i was n't irish . 
   then they came for the portuguese , and i did n't speak out because i was n't portuguese . 
   then they came for me , and there was no one left to speak for me . 
  if people do n't realize that this is happening in europe , that this parallel is not me being melodramatic , that it rings absolutely true to anyone affected by this crisis , that this is a vicious circle , that it will reach ** you ** . 
  we may as well disband the eurozone already . 
  how many more will have to fall before we change policies ? 
  exactly the same going on here . 
  most of my group of friends has already left the country , we are just slowly being destroyed . 
  you clearly are not experiencing austerity . 
  what fucks the middle class over is paying a huge amount of taxes and having no job . 
  their savings are gone a long time ago .
