   extremely high ? 
  dude , the multiplier is often around 2 . 
  in the greek case it 's actually quite low as they import a lot and their taxation is very high . 
  really ? 
  then why did they thought it was going to be around 0.5 or 0.7 . 
  either way it 's bigger than 1 so it 's not getting them any closer to sustainability quite the contrary . 
   i do n't understand how them continuing to accumulate debt can be in the slightest beneficial to greece . 
  i agree , and right now , with the current recipe they are accumulating more debt . 
   just default and tell their creditors to fuck off . 
  this is kind of what they have been doing in slow motion . 
  no it 's not low at all . 
  it 's extremely high . 
   multiply this : 170 debt to gdp ratio . 
  sure , and do you want them to eventually pay some of it or just do small defaults every year as they progressively have less money to pay it with ? 
   first of all , i 'm not taking any side here . 
  i 'm just annoyed by people distorting stuff and hearing what they want to hear . 
  of course , you are taking a side . 
  you seem to want to believe that applying family grocery shopping economics to a country actually works or something . 
   although this particular study was carried out by one of the imf 's chief economists and carries a lot of weight , it does n't represent the fund 's position . 
  true . 
  can you show me any recent study that puts the greek multiplier under 1 ? 
  and if the study is n't true , and the multiplier is less than 1 , why would greece debt to gdp keep rising ? 
  it 's true that it 's not the fund 's position though as , on the ground , they keep demanding for more and more austerity no matter what they say in interviews . 
  which just shows that the fund is either irrational or has some other agenda . 
   finally , even if the multipliers were messed up , it just means the policy was flawed , not necessarily that it resulted in a net harm . 
  no , a multiplier bigger than 1 exactly means that it resulted in a net harm effect . 
  it means that it is destroying the economy faster than you consolidate fiscally , hence , it means that you will not pay your debts and you have fucked potentially good productive capacity in the process . 
  we know the policy was a net harm ever since the imf admitted that they messed up with the multipliers and apparently greece has a pretty high one around 1.7 , maybe more . 
  basically if you want to actually be paid , austerity is not the way to go , as can be shown by the constant restructurings \\* cough \\* defaults \\* cough \\* greece has been doing . 
  if what you want is to teach the average greek a lesson then sure keep doing this . 
  keep in mind that the lesson they learn might not be the one you intended . 
   swedish staff means a better experience for swedish tourists . 
  i do n't really get this kind of tourism . 
  when i 'm abroad i do n't want to be served by a portuguese unless it 's some kind of funny coincidence . 
  that 's why you go abroad . 
  even in a private resort scenario , i would still prefer local servers . 
  this is exactly what it means . 
  fixed obrigado . 
  we have a saying here :  pela boca morre o peixe the fish dies by its mouth, 
  that 's great news . 
  congrats and best of luck in your new job . 
  i do n't think the lack of jobs argument is going to stick ( except maybe for romania ) . 
  since [ relatively speaking ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:uk&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=unemployment%20rate%20great%20britain#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:uk:bg:pt:es:ro:el&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) it is not true . 
  anyway , this is pretty dumb . 
  romanian and bulgarian immigrants are in my experience quite hardworking immigrants that any country should be glad to have , the ones that used to come to portugal ( before the crisis ) even learned the language . 
  they may be a bit drunkard but so is everyone else in europe . 
  i think she meant threat ... 
  this article reads like something out of the mind of some ent that just realized we are all one . 
  indeed , the op 's title which used `` heading for '' is more accurate . 
  so what ? 
  the values are always calculated the same way , with the same margin of error , and margin of error works both ways , up and down . 
  the meaning of this is exactly as the op titled it , the uk is in recession again . 
  this is actually significantly good news as these are not just the 2 year bonds that the ecb is always willing to buy . 
  still a horrible interest rate but not much worse than what we get from the troika . 
  what the hell is wrong with your ( ex ) friends . 
  i could n't care less if my friends are unemployed , lack a girlfriend and/or have adhd ( not really something that we have much around here ) . 
  going to interviews and being rejected messes with everyone 's head , it 's not just you who feels worthless when that happens , everyone does . 
  i remember feeling horribly bad when i got rejected after an interview for a job i did n't even want and just went for the practice . 
  when that happens in a chain it 's even worse , i 've seen it happening . 
  do n't let it get to you or it will become a self fulfilling prophesy . 
  just focus on studying the things you like and working on personal projects while you keep trying . 
  if worse comes to shove , just emigrate here , you 'll still be unemployed but you 'll have company eheheh . 
  yeah it 's working really swell . 
  restructure my debt by over 50 % too please . 
  i think anne applebaum is the stupid one here . 
  what makes it work in some and not others is just 2 things . 
  the level of debt before austerity started and the surrounding economic environment . 
  which were totally different for latvia and greece . 
  whatever i think it 's the sunshine . 
  at least you guys are considering putting troops on the ground , unlike many other european countries leaders who already made it a point of clearly saying to their populace that absolutely no troops will be sent to the ground . 
  it 's not equality that causes suicides . 
  being poor makes people suicide less . 
  if you have fewer poor people you have more suicides . 
  you do n't have time to be depressed and ruminating on first world problems if you are trying to survive until your next meal all the time . 
   if the guy was arguing for that and the typical `` oh , there 's such inequality , the government needs to step in he does n't argue necessarily for that . 
  he gives two examples of paths to very equal , and great quality of life for everyone societies , that reached this goal very differently . 
  one is sweden which has big differences in wages and compensates this trough aggressive taxation and subsidies . 
  the other is japan which does this by having very low differences in wages to begin with and the state hardly has to intervene . 
  i think the japanese example and how they managed to do it , may be worth looking at/studying for the portuguese as i think we would adapt better to their model than the swede one . 
  anyway , i think the video is worth watching , particularly for a portuguese , as we appear in a lot of the shown statistics in a less than favorable light . 
  you do n't see the problem ? 
  seriously ? 
  it 's a country in nato , the european union and the eurozone , it 's hard to find a closer ally . 
  they will potentially be losing men there . 
  i do n't know about you , but i do n't like to be on the sidelines while my friends are fighting no matter how much moral support i give them . 
  do note that i 'm not even going into a - this could affect the security of everyone in europe - argument yet . 
  just one more thing to add to my list of european dysfunctionalities i guess . 
  i wish we had money to send troops there to help . 
  it 's disgraceful that europe is only helping france with logistics . 
  not gon na happen . 
  europe does n't have forward looking leaders , because europe as has been proven by this crisis has no leaders . 
  europe 's countries have leaders , and they will defend their countries myopic interests as that 's what 's popular in elections . 
  i will hold my pitchfork for now . 
  this can be as simple as a peering agreement of some sort which all isps do . 
  it 's not necessarily a net neutrality problem . 
  i need more details . 
  yes . 
  i 'm arguing that it might be `` reasonable force '' to kick him in the head . 
  if you consider `` reasonable '' to be what a reasonable person might do in this situation , which is only feeling safe when he is already knocked out and not able to pull another gun or one of the 2 knives he actually had with him . 
  perhaps they could have trusted the security men to do their job , but , like i said .
