  anyway , to answer the op . 
  yes , i very much want the uk in the eu as i think they contribute a great and different perspective , although i 'd like them to lose some of their `` special '' treatment . 
  pretty much this . 
  meanwhile , silly southerners are stuck doing internal devaluation while the japanese , americans and brits , stay competitive , with a job and pay their debts by doing devaluation the old fashioned way . 
  nope , we 're all like this . 
  there 's nothing more stressful to a portuguese than the prospect of having to say `` no '' to some rebel that decided to turn into an `` asker '' . 
  there 's not much of a difference between a real loan and a loan guarantee nowadays . 
  the effect is pretty much the same . 
  seems like a company that will only get mercenaries . 
  many are good , but most of them are n't the ones i 'd prefer in my team . 
  it 's kinda sad when an extreme guesser , as many portuguese are , goes into that kind of company culture . 
  he will work his ass off seeing if people will recognize his worth only to be trampled by all the others . 
  he will probably find another higher paying job and quit even if offered a raise , as he can no longer enjoy working for this company after such a long time not being appreciated . 
  i think he swapped `` just '' and `` not '' , and meant `` not just askers '' . 
  so he agrees that you are askers , but also inconvenient opinion givers . 
  i do n't really know , just trying to parse sambri 's post . 
  do n't shoot the messenger . 
  those are great examples that happen a lot here too . 
  portuguese are extreme guessers . 
  portuguese ** hate ** saying ** no ** , so they hate being asked for stuff , it 's very common for foreigners to be confused thinking a portuguese agreed to a request when in fact it has n't . 
  expressions portuguese use instead of saying no : - in principle , yes . 
  - i 'll need to check some stuff but i think so . 
  - i 'd like to . 
  - i do n't know yet , but i think so . 
  - if possible , yes . 
  - yes , i 'd love to do it ** one of these days ** . 
  it 's also common for a portuguese to get home and have this conversation with the family `` that pain in the ass asked for something i did n't want to do and i agreed , fuck that guy !, 
  '' ; `` why did n't you say no ? 
  '' ; `` well i did n't want to be unpleasant . '', 
  [ edit ] maybe that 's why so many portuguese are doing ok in switzerland , something i had never considered given how different our cultures are in other circumstances . 
  i do n't like merkel very much , but apart from the nuclear thing which i thought was stupid , it 's not for the reasons stated in the article . 
  i think the author does n't grasp german politics . 
  i do n't see why the auction will run badly next week . 
  are they trying to sell 10 year bonds ? 
  if most of those are 2 year bonds , they 're pretty much backed by the ecb right ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  are you defending that we should be in a common market with a country like china which has no decent environmental standards ? 
  regulations prevent a race to the bottom not only within the common market but with those outside it . 
  the uk seems to want to be in the common market but playing with china rules . 
  that is not fair at all . 
  clouds . 
  as someone who experienced 43\u00bac days this summer . 
  it is not . 
  you can outwear cold , not so much with heat . 
  is that even still true ? 
  have n't they already achieved a primary surplus ? 
  nope , nope , nope !, 
   the more we argue over if austerity is good or not , the more we remain in these quicksand situation and the worse it will be for us in the long run . 
  austerity , as it is objectively practiced in europe ( and in portugal ) is ** objectively ** bad , this is not the first imf study showing that . 
  this is something you agree with and has been made clear in all your posts . 
  so ... stop defending some kind of academic definition of austerity . 
  we are talking about the real world here , the one were people get hurt . 
  so ... real world definitions of the word matter . 
  and real world definitions of the word is what we are discussing here . 
  btw , i will be glad when after many publications the economics doctorates can agree on what austerity means , i remind you that our austerity plan was decided by ( academically ) very competent people , but , right now , it means the fucking shit we are doing right now and everything else is not reality . 
  when i say it does n't work i am speaking exactly , and totally , about what we are doing right now . 
  what 's ridiculous is that you totally agree with me and we are arguing semantics when we should be arguing that both the eurozone , and our government , have gone completely mad - on a stupid morality and emotional crusade - when what should have happened was a purely rational problem being solved with simple means . 
  i 'm starting to fear that you 've joined some kind of party youth by how obstinate ( may be a wrong impression ) you seem to be in your positions . 
  i 'm not against your brand of austerity . 
  but that 's not what we 're doing is it ? 
  the austerity we are doing is effectively ruining our gdp in both the short and the long term . 
  so stop defending an imaginary austerity . 
  i am obviously speaking about the austerity effectively being practiced in europe , i 'm not arguing semantics about what austerity means . 
  you seem to think i want europe to pay for more stuff here . 
  i thought it was clear that what i want is for the well off european countries to follow more expansionary policies , perhaps helped by an european wide lending mechanism , coupled with the kind of `` austerity '' you defend here . 
  first of all , austerity is increasing our debt as a percentage of gdp so if you keep doing it you will soon reach your 300 % as our gdp continues rock sliding . 
  so if you do n't think 300 % is desirable you should want to change the current strategy . 
  also , you seem to think that a country is like a company or a household . 
  it is n't , the same way the multiplier works for austerity it works for spending too . 
  you can increase revenue by spending more . 
  that said , this would never work if portugal did it alone , as we are a very small economy worldwide , in the eurozone and we do n't control our currency . 
  and yes we obviously need reforms . 
  what is needed is an european wide stimulus , if necessary financed by the ecb itself . 
  keep doing the necessary reforms on the troubled countries by all means but stop this idiotic bleeding by expanding the economies of the countries that are n't troubled . 
  it really does n't matter . 
  europe never did austerity because it works . 
  we did it for moral reasons . 
  to teach people a lesson . 
  we do n't even care that the end result is not getting our debts paid as evidenced by the multiple greek restructurings . 
  not at all , portuguese love talking about their culture and history and will talk about it to anyone willing to listen to them including other portuguese . 
  ahahah , do n't mind uat2d , portuguese quite like the us and americans . 
  you would feel quite welcomed here . 
  most portuguese do n't feel offended at all even if you fuck up and disrespect our culture or behave like the stereotypical ` merican uat2d portrayed . 
  they will try to teach you though . 
  so be prepared for people trying to tell you all about our history . 
  it 's not easy to work in evictions and see people suicide themselves , often in the little time they give you to bag some stuff . 
  it 's pretty depressing even when that does n't happen as there are children crying and disoriented old people . 
  i 'm not surprised that after doing so many in such a short time many of them simply ca n't stomach it anymore for a while . 
  [ haha ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=airhvo1wa78 ), 
  this was a pretty funny protest that happened after our beloved president complained about how hard it was to get by with his various pensions . 
  a few portuguese felt his pain and went to his house to donate some first necessity foodstuffs . 
  just to be clear for other europeans , portuguese austerity is not in doubt at all for now . 
  as it obviously could n't be without an european change of policy since we do n't have any money . 
  if the constitutional court does n't let the government do some of the measures they intended they will just replace them with something else . 
  that said , it 's pretty obvious now that the objectives and timeline we have agreed with europe will fail as most of the measures are being counter-productive , none of the predictions the troika and our government made are being confirmed , and our economy keeps falling like a rock . 
   will be just like greece . 
  pretty much , we will be in shambles and `` restructuring '' our debt by the end of the year . 
  fucking great solution this is . 
  well i thought psychopathic would be a bit too strong , i think we 're talking about a mild case of lack of empathy here . 
  you do n't need to shed a tear , although i find your lack of sensibility bordering on sociopathic , just do n't make fun of it ; there 's nothing funny about what people are going through right now or during the great famine .
