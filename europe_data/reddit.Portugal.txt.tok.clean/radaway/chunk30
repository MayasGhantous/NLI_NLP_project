  merkel ( and germany by extension ) as the flag bearer of austerity , objectively has part of the blame . 
  this is n't just some silly need to blame someone . 
  of course lots of other people/countries have it too , namely , our own politicians . 
  for that kind of visit , i 'd recommend coming with warmer weather so you can enjoy the outdoor terraces . 
  if you 're coming during the winter the area does n't matter as much as there are good restaurants scattered all over lisbon . 
  anyway , my recommendation would be . 
  during the day , you can head to bel\u00e9m and eat some [ nice pastries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastel_de_nata ) and coffee while you look at the [ jer\u00f3nimos monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:jer%c3%b3nimos_april_2009-4.jpg ) . 
  during the night , go downtown where if you 're a bit careful you can have a good dinner avoiding the tourist traps and still see some pretty stuff from outside ( you can try pin\u00f3quio in avenida da liberdade ) . 
  after dinner walk until [ terreiro do pa\u00e7o ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pra%c3%a7a_do_com%c3%a9rcio ) where a new disco opened . 
  take a look around because it 's fucking pretty , then decide if you want the disco there or go to the bars in the nearby cais do sodr\u00e9 before going to some other disco . 
  the night ends very late in lisbon so there 's no hurry , go to the cais do sodr\u00e9 bars then decide . 
  i 've tried to balance good eating , seeing stuff without actually going into a museum , and a proper end of day drunkenness . 
  but this is just one day , you can really do a lot of other stuff , maybe other portuguese wo n't mind planning your other days . 
  the annoying thing to me is that she seems to be implying that the 25 % of gdp and 50 % social spending are related in a 1:1 ratio or something . 
  the rest of the world does not do enough social spending that 's why they are shitholes and we have 50 % of it . 
  these 2 percentages are not comparable at all . 
  just because 2 things are a percentage it does n't mean they are in the same unit . 
  i find this comparison intellectually extremely dishonest . 
  i think he was asking for specific places . 
  let me suggest a few : - [ praia da cordoama ] ( http://www.minube.pt/fotos/sitio-preferido/8421/41051 ) - [ serra do ger\u00eas ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=serra+do+ger%c3%aas&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=u&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nedpunkcl8ithgef9yhobq&amp;ved=0ce4qsaq&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606 ) - [ the staircase of the church in lamego ] ( http://imgur.com/1t1hr ) - [ the lello e irm\u00e3o bookshop in porto ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=lello+e+irm%c3%a3os+porto&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=u&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=nkhpulynpmwihqejjycgaw&amp;ved=0cegqsaq&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606#hl=pt-pt&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lello+e+irm%c3%a3o+porto&amp;oq=lello+e+irm%c3%a3o+porto&amp;gs_l=img.3...1478.1478.0.1684.1.1.0.0.0.0.55.55.1.1.0...0.0...1c.1.ynwqzzdfgwg&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355325884,d.zg4&amp;fp=9030d40036ac9518&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;biw=1241&amp;bih=606 ) these are a very small sample , i could be suggesting stuff for months . 
  i honestly think portugal is one of the most underrated tourist destinations . 
  i disagree as they also have an influence on the other users . 
  do we want to create a pleasant environment where things can be discussed rationally or do we want a sub where people are constantly trolled and harassed ? 
  i 'm all for freedom of speech but any `` in real life '' public forum would not tolerate the constant trolling we see here . 
  this subreddit is starting to suffer from the effect where people behave like trolls because they see lots of other trolls around instead of carefully constructed posts . 
  problem is not solved because they keep trolling all threads . 
  i do n't think it 's that big a deal anyway but it is certainly * annoying * that we have a troll comment in every single submission on / r/europe . 
  there 's no need to be sarcastic . 
  it is perfectly possible to express yourself normally and get your point across . 
  i agree with you for normal posts , but constant trolls should just be banned . 
  i 've seen very different statistics for this . 
  this map is based just on prof. lynn study , and iq is pretty much bullshit anyway . 
  this is also the dude who said men are more intelligent than women by 5 iq points so i do n't think he 's very credible and that his studies are unbiased . 
  he seems to favor whatever group he 's part of as can be seen by the relatively high uk iq result , which is hilarious in my opinion . 
  it has nothing to do with that , these people are constantly trolling and it 's annoying and disrupts this sub . 
  ^ pickpocket, 
  i think we all do this , only silly americans think it is ok to use only the fork . 
  we do cook it in one piece but i 've never seen anyone using a plate to break it up . 
  agreed . 
  it also seems to have the perfect shape to get the coffee cold way too fast . 
  it 's pretty much the same situation . 
  spain has a series of small regional savings banks . 
  in portugal and spain many small banks and even some bigger ones have `` caixa '' in their names . 
  in spain these small banks were a huge part of the housing bubble they experienced . 
  case in point , portugal which is similar to spain in many aspects , mostly does n't have small regional savings banks and experienced only a very small housing bubble . 
  so it is not ** one ** corrupt as fuck bank , but a series of small banks not being regulated enough and trying to maximize their profits with little foresight . 
  so i see a very big parallel with the german situation . 
   but leaves most of germany 's retail banking sector -- and its politically powerful network of savings banks ah , germans want to have the possibility of doing their version of the spanish caixas ... 
  this is stupid . 
  have n't seen it . 
  a co-worker recommended it to me a few weeks ago and now it 's referenced on reddit . 
  i guess it 's time to see it and i can see how that quote fits in the mentality they portray in the movie . 
  i still stand by my point of course , many people literally believe that quote . 
  [ this is all i can think about right now ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddai8ff3f4&amp;t=10s ), 
  i do n't know why you were downvoted , that 's a point of view . 
  i quite disagree with it , but it 's a valid contribution to this discussion ; again i remind / r/europe of the [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  in this comment you seem like a free market fundamentalist . 
  in my opinion , people thankfully do not behave like the horrible `` rational agents '' those guys have in their models , and much if not most of human endeavors and progress has not came out of greed . 
  of course you will then argue that they always have some kind of greed , greed for feeling good about themselves , or something . 
  that must be the kind of greed that makes me give coins to beggars when i 'm stopped on traffic lights alone in my car and no one but me will know about my good deed . 
  i do n't think that 's what is really happening . 
  people have a lot more motivating them than greed and it is horribly reductionist to put everything trough the greed looking glass . 
  i totally used to agree with you , but frankly as the economic crisis unfurled and i watched the incompetence of eu institutions , the lack of solidarity between europeans from different countries , the management of a common currency only in the interest of few , and the constant lies fed to europeans by the commission , the ecb and the various european leaders . 
  i 'm very much starting to doubt that . 
  furthermore , the eu future is objectively weak . 
  while the eurozone does n't break the negative feedback loop it got itself into , no one with close economic ties to the eurozone will be doing well . 
  i see no signs that the eurozone will start doing the right thing anytime soon . 
  it does n't have catalytic converter !, 
  because the eu future is n't weak ? 
  eheheheh dude i did say . 
   that said , some of these answers can probably be attributed to people being nervous of being asked questions by someone with a camera , and just saying the first thing that comes to mind . 
  so i agree with you , but plenty of them said things like `` oh i do n't know about that stuff '' , which i interpret as `` i 'm not even going to use my brain to think about it '' . 
  i think there are a few more culprits like the other countries that stubbornly still demand austerity when it has already shown it is not working , or even the european comission - barroso recently had the nerve to say , while smiling , that austerity is working in an interview in portugal when all the portuguese know it is not ; or the ecb that still says that europe will be growing by the end of 2013 when it is obvious that it wont . 
  in my opinion the incompetence is widespread across europe and that is the problem . 
  the germans must be pissed off too , they made the latest patchwork job on greece thinking it would delay further problems until after their elections . 
  boy were they wrong . 
  anyway i get confused when i ca n't understand if you 're trolling or being serious . 
  berlusconi 's party withdrew it 's support so he really did n't have democratic legitimacy anymore . 
  i 'm not sure that 's an excuse . 
  many of them did n't even try to use their brain . 
  you can see the cogs turning into the right answer in the young girl and old dude that got it right . 
  i excuse the guy that answered as if we were speaking about planets as the original question does n't make any sense due to how obvious the answer is . 
  frankly , this video annoys me , it shows that many people have not only conformed themselves with being ignorant , they are also ok with not using their brain and not trying to understand what is being told to them . 
  that said , some of these answers can probably be attributed to people being nervous of being asked questions by someone with a camera , and just saying the first thing that comes to mind . 
  of course what ben9345 suggested is not even an option , but your answer to it is the argument blocking any solution to the eurozone crisis . 
  ah the european problem in one sentence . 
  i do n't think there 's any particular `` hate on her '' over here , we just did n't elect her and think the current eurozone policies are counterproductive if not outright suicidal . 
  you are right , of course , she 's certainly not the only culprit for austerity being the route europe has taken . 
  true , portuguezer is not happy with that . 
  you certainly have your tribal instincts quite well developed . 
  i know that redditor generation has n't experienced war unless they 're a ptsd american , but dude ... not cool . 
  not long after that we were helping with the 1st world war so clearly we got over it . 
  it certainly is true that it was a big deal for us at the time though . 
  we have plenty of africans here from our former colonies and we do n't seem to have this problem . 
  to be fair , they 're not north africans so maybe the problem lies in the differences in culture between north africans and angolans , mozambicans , cape verdeans , etc. 
  and between the receiving country culture and the culture of portugal . 
  we do lots of things wrong here ( finances ) , but there is also some good stuff that other europeans can learn from us , and analyzing the differences can be worth it . 
  this saddens me and would sadden most portuguese if it is seriously going to happen . 
  the uk is a country the portuguese quite like and we see it as a friend and one of our [ oldest allies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) . 
  the european union is certainly better with the british aboard from my perspective .
