  since i would not be able to live in my country , which is all i want , i may aswell go where i have the biggest chance of faring well . 
  i know this creates a problem for europe but i do n't understand why people ca n't empathise . 
  it 's not a big surprise . 
  they decided austerity was the way for europe , thus crashing all their importers here , they said it did n't matter because they could export to china and other emerging markets , now with all the commodities down the brics are collapsing so they have nowhere to export to . 
  everyone going mercantilist , everyone lowering wages so everyone consumes less and exports more , does n't work very well when everyone 's doing it germany . 
  capital controls were the result of the liquidity squeeze europe imposed on greece . 
   `` in 2010 , the systemic waiver was applied as a restructuring of the debt in hands of the private creditors was needed to restore debt sustainability , which could have caused major contagion , '' the minutes state . 
  `` currently , a restructuring of official debt is required and staff could think only of a few instances in which public debt restructuring could create contagion . '' so , basically , for the imf it only matters if the contagion affects private banks , if the contagion affects other states and their tax payers , they do n't give a shit . 
  of course not , because then these states will have to borrow money from the banks that created the problem in the first place and they will profit from it . 
  fuck this shit . 
  [ sean connery agrees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0d1ztafka ), 
  why are you talking in terms of western and eastern ukraine ? 
  there 's just one ukraine . 
  agreed . 
  portuguese goverments correctly predicted this and made sure no migrant would want to come here . 
  the uk was just irresponsible and did not prepare correctly , they 're like the grasshopper in the story and now winter has come . 
  i do n't think the stereotypes and demonizing the rest of the eu have done to the greeks is funny . 
  as a portuguese you should n't think it 's funny either . 
  people are still putting us in a group they feel it 's perfectly acceptable to call piigs to . 
  if you think these stereotypes are funny and do n't have consequences you 're wrong . 
  i have to battle that much harder to get international clients in no small part because of this as it 's much harder for them to trust us than for instance a german . 
  so , no , i wo n't calm down , and everyone calling us piigs and stereotyping the people of any country in the eu can go fuck themselves . 
  ohh wow . 
  sigh, 
  i do n't have aspergers you retard , i just like to keep my private life ** private ** . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a bad idea to have counseling i 'm saying it 's a bad idea to make it mandatory . 
  for many it 's just making them jump through hoops . 
   i do n't think it 's unreasonable to go through some counselling , it ca n't hurt , can it ? 
  i disagree , i think it can . 
  i 'm a very reserved person and i hate to talk about my personal matters with strangers . 
  if i was a woman and i needed an abortion this would seriously add up to the stress of an already stressful situation . 
  sure , but it should be optional . 
  i agree . 
  the small fee , that does n't even affect the poorest , was not only ** not ** a bad thing , it was unfortunately necessary ; because a lot of people were having abortions every year instead of using proper contraceptives . 
  otoh i find the forced counselling despicable . 
  do n't worry much about what mizruby said , i used to think the exact same thing when i was younger , i used to think that fado would fade or something , what i found when i reached my 30 's was that many people start to get interested in fado and watching the shows in the small restaurants and bars . 
  it 's just normal that it does n't appeal so much to younger people as it 's more of a reflexive mood . 
  i do n't want to devalue for political reasons , i want to devalue for extremely valid economic reasons , in fact draghi agrees with me and its his measures that have been making things somewhat better, 
  i was arguing for a devaluation of the euro itself not a devaluation of a future drachma so that it would n't be necessary for them to leave . 
  exiting now will be horrible no matter what , the only question , which no one knows the answer for , is if it 's worse for them than staying if things do n't change . 
  it helps the economy deleverage ( there is a lot of private debt that is holding investments back ) , it makes it easier for my country to become competitive as it will inevitably have less inflation than the core countries due to austerity , it stops deflation which is horrible for the economy , it also makes our imports more competitive . 
  due to these factors unemployment goes down and the confidence goes up which makes it much easier to have any kind of profitable business or to simply get a job . 
   how old are you ? 
  clearly much older than you are , i had my gold bug phase many moons ago as you can see by the age of my reddit account . 
   have you ever lived with a devalued currency ? 
  yes i have . 
   countries want hard currency . 
  it makes the people rich . 
  really ? 
  when you have 25 % unemployment and you ca n't even get a job how do you get rich ? 
  because either they 're stuck there or they believe that the eu will eventually evolve into a full federation . 
   all of those are quite significant , and to most serious commentators agree that these benefits far outweigh the lack of flexibility . 
  no they do n't , who are those serious commentators ? 
  most commentators ( at least if they 're economists ) agree quite the opposite , it 's not even a matter of opinion , you can just do the math . 
  hence why the euro does n't work . 
  germany has huge trade surpluses , that makes germany have large deposits , the deposits are loaned to countries like my own very cheaply . 
  rinse and repeat until you have a debt crisis . 
  the handling of this crisis has been complete bullshit . 
  the euro and the eu basically means you lose all the abilities you had of regulating your trade balance and all that you have left is austerity as that will certainly make you stop importing since you do n't have any money . 
  if europe does n't go full federation and fixes this quite soon it can go fuck itself . 
  it will ( fuck itself ) , because people eventually get sick of this . 
  i think he was working for a way out of this situation , if the only way out was a grexit he was prepared to do it , which by the way you must be otherwise there 's nothing to negotiate . 
  instead we keep extend and pretend . 
  i actually think it 's wrong to be proud . 
  do n't misunderstand me , i love my country and culture , ** love ** them , but i 'm not proud at all . 
  i 'm proud of the accomplishments i have made in my life , there 's no reason to be proud of my national identity which is just a birth accident . 
  it 's nice that you 're partying now , but your future is grim , the last time portugal was favorite and lost in a euro final was with greece , look what happened to them . 
  you think that they wo n't all default ? 
  no one will be able to pay a debt in euros . 
  this is very scary . 
  what debts ? 
  they will default on everything if they go that path , i ca n't even imagine the shockwaves , europe is crazy . 
   breast reduction but is this even legal ? 
  in advance *, 
  cut the bullshit prices are much cheaper in romania http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=greece&amp;country2=romania, 
  they will have a deal on monday otherwise the meeting would have been scheduled for friday after the banks were closed . 
  the fact that it 's happening on a monday means you will most definitely get a deal , otherwise they would do it on a friday after the banks were closed . 
  it 's not just that greek prices are higher , it 's also that the greeks got in debt based on their previous wages , so when you lower the wage they will go insolvent , then their banks go insolvent , then the state bailouts the banks and the state gets even more insolvent . 
  the insolvent state is also receiving less taxes because of all the businesses that were bankrupt by the lowering of wages as you will get less consumption , so it becomes even more insolvent . 
  in summary , it 's complicated as hell , and grocery shopping maths do n't help here . 
  sadly that was probably the reason as there were no brake marks on the ground . 
  still , it is quite rare in portugal as the tickets are huge for drivers doing more hours than they should and the buses must be equipped with tachographs . 
  a metaphor is just a comparison , i think anyone can agree that the current greek situation has a lot of similarities with a debtors prison . 
  this is true , i would rate most of my interactions with the police here as positive . 
  i only had 1 instance out of maybe 20 where the policeman was a complete asshole , still , even then , i was n't beat up , and i guess he decided to be an asshole to me instead of giving me a ticket which is better for my pocket . 
  which still makes it a problem as it raises the value of the euro for everyone else . 
  anything by e\u00e7a de queiroz really , he lived more than 100 years ago and society has n't change one bit . 
   people had got sick and tired of being lectured about austerity and the effects of the crisis apparently they have n't been lectured enough because they still think the current recipe is working . 
   their task is to let go of an approach that has failed . 
  this is the problem the current greek government does n't understand . 
  no one will admit this . 
  so , they have to be ready to at least `` pretend '' that we are doing the same thing and that they `` lost '' the negotiations . 
  then trough some backdoor they will get what they want . 
  seriously this is eu politics 101 . 
  the man is a moron but his name is barroso , not barosso . 
  should n't she be jailed for treason or something ? 
   man , i hate the internet today . 
  i ca n't even describe how much april fools annoys me , everyone suddenly thinks they 're a comediant . 
  he is . 
  this is pre-trial detention .
