  what do they mean the same conditions as portugal and the others ? 
  can i get the same conditions as them and have 150billions of my debt forgiven ? 
  i do n't think we 're dealing with the greek economic problems correctly but , please , do n't give me bullshit . 
  water in greece ** is ** quite warm as in almost all the mediterranean . 
  for algae the best temperature is around 12-13 degrees not 16-22 . http://seatemperature.info/greece-water-temperature.html in portugal you do n't often get crystal clear water because we 're in the atlantic which is much colder . 
  clear blue water is not exactly a good thing anyway , it just means the water temperature is too high for microscopic algae to grow , it 's essentially a desert and one of the feedback loops that is fucking up our planet due to global warming . 
  most portuguese beaches do n't have clear blue water either , they 're also better for your health as they give you a healthy dosage of iodine just by bathing there . 
  note the italics . 
  the problem is that their debt is in euros if you do internal devaluation you will also get less money back in taxes , since your debt is exactly the same they still ca n't pay it . 
  now if their debt was also denominated in their own coin , they could devalue their coin , become more competitive and at the same time pay back their debt . 
   other nations with 100 % + gdp do n't cry that their debt is unsustainable . 
  you dodged that part . 
  the second link sounds much like some conspiracy theory . 
  anyone can take a picture of some printed piece of paper . 
  well , to be fair , if you say that it 's pretty much a self-fulfilling prophesy and much faster than otherwise . 
  everyone knows our debt is unpayable , we do n't care , we will not say it , we will just kick the can down the road until someone else solves our problem . 
  well ... islam is pretty extremist . 
  anyway , the only way to control this stuff is to educate people as much as you can so they will be less propense to believe in bullshit . 
  they did n't kill anyone there . 
  i 'm also not trying to justify it , because it 's their job and they have to deal with it professionally , but that used to be a very very dangerous neighbourhood , basically a favela , where police could easily get shot if they gave people they approached an opening . 
  we 're also one of the poorest on the list . 
  so yay for portugal 's poor , but honest , people . 
  you are now banned from / r/portugalcaralho, 
  there 's nothing we can do , there 's a money supply problem , the only way to create money is debt , people must get into more debt !, 
  i personally think [ amoreiras towers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0fprrrt.jpg ) are the ugliest buildings in lisbon , possibly the ugliest in portugal . 
  he 's a repeat offender , he keeps making claims that other people and the courts themselves are criminal and corrupt , yet he can not present any kind of evidence for the claims . 
  usually he would be immune by being a parliamentarian but all the others voted to have his immunity lifted because he kept creating problems in the normal work of the parliament . 
  jo\u00e3o manuel coelho is a parliamentarian in madeira , a court ordered him to pay a 106k $ compensation to maria jo\u00e3o marques because of defamation . 
  this means 700 euros of his paycheck goes to pay the compensation . 
  so he said `` if you take everything i have , take the clothes too ! '', 
  ahh it will trickle down . 
  of course . 
  oh it 's a good thing the euro is high then all the unemployed can buy a bunch of stuff . 
  portugal ** is ** one of the most melancholic places on earth we live in a state of almost permanent [ saudade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudade ) . 
  whoever made this map does n't know shit about us . 
  i ca n't even explain it . 
  i 'd just really like to visit iceland . 
  if it 's anything like in portugal , not very much , even getting nothing is possible by our law unless the person can prove he is innocent . 
  the european human rights court is the best way to get a decent compensation because in our courts you will spend a huge amount of money and wait a huge amount of time before you get something . 
  just get one of the me refugees to do it they have years of experience . 
  would n't it be simpler to just shotgun the drones ? 
  or are they worried about flying bombs or something that the eagles would fly far away ? 
  the word bosque actually also exists in portuguese, 
   `` this is significant because it 's an ~ ~ italian ~ ~ portugese actually working ! '', 
  says a finn who makes 2 english mistakes in a short sentence and did n't even get the nationality right . 
  go get drunk and beat your wife , is n't that all you guys do ? 
  we do n't really see it as acceptance , it 's more that we do n't really care if you 're gay or not , it 's your business and it does n't affect anyone else . 
  pretty much . 
  this kind of protests are to be expected . 
  although i do n't remember much of them specifically about gay marriage in portugal . 
  if you decentralize power production , pretty soon people wo n't need power companies anymore . 
  i 'm guessing that 's their logic . 
  newspapers are [ dangerous ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millwall_brick ) !, 
  so reducing work hours to 35 hours again , that 's not reducing austerity ? 
  not much . 
  partly because of the previous presidents as they have n't been using their powers in full , so people are under the impression our presidents have very little power when that 's just not true . 
  of course austerity continues just as before , the only difference is that now , instead of austerity affecting everyone , you do n't get affected if you 're a public servant or a restaurant owner . 
  thanks left wing !, 
  protecting the privileged every day !, 
  holy shit i thought our commies were crazy . 
  it 's possible he 's a banker . 
  lol my brother lived and worked there for a couple of years he quite liked it . 
  looks like the earth 's crust is infected with some sort of fungi . 
  no one was listening because he said it during the telenovela . 
  can you send money pls ? 
  we have a brilliant economic stimulus program by our genious socialist government we just need some change to implement it . 
  basically what you 're saying is that you do n't care about what the truth is . 
  people , according to you , are retarded and need to be guided by iron age philosophy . 
  i think it 's more a matter of us being countries with relatively warm climates so , usually , our shoes are n't full of mud and other stuff that would dirty the floor , if by chance they are slightly dirty , the doormat is more than enough to clean them . 
  also , since it 's warm , feet do get more smelly than otherwise . 
  i like how portuguese have strong opinions even about leaders they hardly know . 
  i would n't underestimate how poorly we play when we are a clear favorite . 
  you need to ask your husband . 
  no we actually need it . 
  he can print quite a lot more and we still would n't get that much inflation as most of that money would be used for deleveraging . 
  i very much dislike putin and the way russia has been behaving . 
  however that argument is n't good because syria considers the part of land where the russian plane was flying to be their territory . 
  so it would still be the turks doing the same thing russia did to them to another country . 
  it really is . 
  frankly , i could be doing at least 10x better if i moved to another country . 
  i do n't care , i love living here too much to move , no matter how idiotic our politicians are . 
  portugal used to have a big palace made of wood called `` the royal tent '' ( which does n't quite capture the portuguese version of the name - real barraca ) . 
  anyone want to guess what happened to it ? 
  that 's some old school communist shit right there . 
  this one wants to go back to the soviet union times . 
  he 's nowhere close as controversial as any of those 2 and he holds almost none of their views . 
  this is retarded . 
  all websites have cookies . 
  even without a cookie if you come to my website i can track you . 
  i 'm super cereal all for privacy , but , this is retarded . 
  i believe those are gang members not gangbangers, 
  i do n't know about the italian reality but if it 's anything like the portuguese one , it 's possible to reduce the budget by 50 % and do the same things you did with the previous budget . 
  what i mean is that most state purchases of it services go to very expensive consulting firms that have political connections . 
  it 's possible to do the exact same work they do with a much smaller budget by hiring smaller , more agile , shops instead ; in fact , for some projects , you can expect to be able to do the same with 20 % of the budget . 
  of course that , given the importance of it , one could argue that it would be better to force the state to do more with the current budget than actually reduce it . 
  almost no one has , the way the euro is designed right now . 
  the only way to have a chance inside the euro is if the german federation lets you be one of their states . 
  no it 's not over at all because the bill will then fall on the other eurozone countries , countries like portugal which ca n't afford it at all . 
  as if greece would not default immediately were they to leave the ez , how are they supposed to be able to pay a debt denominated in euros in drachmas . 
  i think foreigners think we have a temperament similar to the other mediterranean cultures , when in fact it 's completely different .
