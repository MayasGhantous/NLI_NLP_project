  so they think this is a huge mess , because everyone is freaking the fuck out . 
  in reality , everyone is completely calm , no democratic rules were disrespected , and we will solve this like we solve everything - slowly . 
  i really like whole grains ( for instance i love brown rice ) but the taste ** is ** different , so you ca n't just directly replace it in a recipe . 
  romanians also meet all of the technical criteria so i 'm not really sure what your point is . 
  well , so they could see with their own eyes that modern romania is not much different from many countries already in schengen . 
  it 's completely retarded that they have n't let romania join like a couple of years ago . 
  have people that make these stupid ass decisions even been to romania ? 
  romanians are completely right to be offended . 
  i 've tasted this , did n't even know what it was until i saw this video , it 's surprisingly good for such a simple cake . 
  well most professions will disappear in the next 20-30 years , there 's no point trying to fight progress . 
   they were n't threatened with sanctions . 
  they actually were , the commission threatened to enact a fine or to withhold eu funds . 
   on the deficit , how are france and germany the greatest offenders ? 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  i did n't mention deficit , they are some of the greatest offenders of the rules . 
  namely trade surplus when it comes to germany . 
  france has been disrespecting the deficit limit since forever . 
  so the rules do n't apply to net contributors ? 
  ca n't you see how bad that is ? 
  i 'm not even going to talk about it being one of the most important principles of any rule system that it applies equally to everyone . 
  ca n't you see that economically that can create situations like the current one where germany 's continuous and huge trade surplus fucks everyone else and it does n't matter because they 're net contributors ? 
  except all those countries , but france , were `` blackmailed '' into doing at least part of what the commission arbitrarily decided to demand not to get sanctions . 
  edit - i say blackmail inside quotes because i agree that the commission can demand some change of direction if a country does n't abide by the rules , i just do n't agree that this is applied only to some countries and never to the likes of france and germany who are easily the greatest offenders . 
  it really depends on how long you spend commuting . 
  if you spend 3 hours a day , it 's definitely not worth it . 
  doubtful , the truth is , banks need a lot fewer people nowadays as people are doing most of their interactions with them online . 
  most banks have too many people and will not be hiring most of them . 
  lisbon ** is ** a great city but , in terms of food , it 's one of the worse places , in lisbon you really need to know where you 're going to eat well for a reasonable price . 
  that 's ugly as shit . 
  brutalism is fucking horrible . 
  yes , my point is that most cultures consider bribing someone bad , either if it 's made nationally or abroad . 
  it seems to me that germans tend to think it 's ok if you do it abroad . 
  what does dan aykroyd has to say about that light flying and changing directions way too quickly in the end ? 
  you are reinforcing my point . 
  you are german and , like i said , you think it 's ok . 
  actually , you usually put the majority of the blame on the one hiring the hitman . 
  there are a lot of countries completely destroyed by foreign companies corrupting the locals . 
  so if i go to elbonia and hire a hitman to kill a person that is creating problems for my business , that is ok , because the hitman was already killing people for money and lots of other businessman do that in elbonia . 
  sure : http://blog.transparency.org/2012/09/03/dealing-in-the-dark-portugals-sad-case-study-on-defence-procurement/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens_greek_bribery_scandal there are many many many more examples . 
  yes , if you consider the damage they cause . 
  yes , like i said , they mostly do n't practice corruption inside germany . 
  i really was n't being sarcastic . 
  i think there 's a culture in germany where corruption is a totally ok method of growing your business as long as you 're not corrupting and bribing people in germany itself . 
  which is why i find it very insidious . 
  just another example of germany 's corruption destroying europe . 
  in many ways , the kind of corruption you see in that country , is far worse than what you see in the south . 
  the truck can pick up a `` loader/unloader '' once it gets to its destination . 
  drivers wo n't be a problem very soon . 
   i do n't think that anyone believes that it makes sense to keep people employed if they are obsolete . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  sometimes some moral purity would be nice , for instance , corrupting officials is just as bad if you do it in countries other than your own . 
  ah , that was my first car too , i got it to 172 km/h on a very long stretch of highway going down . 
  pretty sure i 'm protected by odin . 
  i do n't think he was a good pm , but he 's a good guy , we could do a lot worse ( like motherfucking barroso ) . 
  this would actually help . 
  ideally the spending would be in countries such as germany and not in the mediterranean as that would help fix the imbalances . 
  you are assuming they are stupid . 
  they are not . 
  they know perfectly well their economics are flawed , but the version of economics they sell is a simple one , a narrative any dumbass can understand and feel good about himself thinking they understand the world . 
  so , they use it , not because the story they tell is an intellectually sound one , but because it serves their ** self-interest ** and it can convince a great many people . 
  no one should be allowed to cover their face in public unless strictly required by the activity they 're doing . 
  europe should heed the expert 's advice . 
  the euro , as it is , does not work , and i do n't see any reforms being made towards a future where it will . 
  yeah but buying a new tv should not be reason enough for the neighbours to rat you and for your home to be searched . 
  how can you even verify this ? 
  will you make neighbours rat on each other ? 
  `` i saw my neighbour with a new gold necklace '' . 
  it seems awfully close to witch hunting . 
  i do n't get it , greeks now have to declare how many toothpicks they have ? 
  what 's the purpose of this ? 
  are they planning on pillaging private residences ? 
  i actually agree with you , it 's just hypocritical for the others criticize malta when they do the same ( namely my own country ) . 
  almost every country in europe has something like this . 
  it seems to me the divide is between good and decent folks , and people such as yourself that think they 're better than the others due to a geographical birth accident . 
  it 's one of the problems in europe , lots of people still think in atavic tribal terms . 
  ridiculous . 
  this must have been written by a lawyer . 
  the eu has to be much more than rules , laws and bureaucracy , the problem is not that we need more rules and we need to strictly follow them , the problem is that the eu is little more than that right now . 
  you can make it actually work with true federalism because you will have fiscal transfers that compensate for the imbalances . 
  that 's ridiculous , europe 's private and public sector are heavily leveraged , having deflation is the worst that can happen now . 
  i 'm pretty sure i saw a muslim arriving in an electric car , those things are dangerous !, 
  islam seems to be the nation 's version of meth, 
  i 'm right wing myself but it does n't make any sense to me, 
  how were budget cuts supposed to help the economy ? 
   we have yet to see what the ecofin will do ( schauble 's there ) surprisingly schauble is said to have lobbied so that the sanctions would be zero . 
   al-andalus was a cultured , civilized state , actually . 
  at that point in time and space christianity were the fundamentalist barbarians and islam the civilized and tolerant ones ... that 's is sort of bullshit , but i do n't really care , do you know what we called our war back then `` reconquista '' , which means conquering back , ** they ** were the invaders . 
   christianity was in the same situation , once . 
  sure was , but there was no internet or the huge amount of freely available knowledge you have today , so it was kind of more excusable back then . 
  as if the crusades were caused by christianity . 
  the crusades were launched in response to muslim attack and expansion , not the other way around . 
  i know because we had to conquer most of our country from muslims . 
  islam was an aggressive jihadist religion then and it is now . 
  i do n't see how they can have any kind of enlightenment while they consider the writings set in stone , the same way some christian fundamentalist still do , i do n't see that changing any time soon . 
  well no religion helps as ignorant sheep make poor voters , and catholicism was certainly part of the problem in our case . 
  however islam is different from catholicism in that it still has religious law , something that catholicism has given up long ago . 
  it 's also different in that its writings clearly discriminate infidels ( they ca n't even marry people that are n't following an abrahamic religion ) . 
  anyway if you 're comparing islam to what christianity used to be , you have a point , it 's fucking retarded , it 's about time they have their enlightenment . 
  yeah you 're supposed to be moving forward not backwards . 
  turkey is the ultimate proof islam is incompatible with a modern liberal democracy .
