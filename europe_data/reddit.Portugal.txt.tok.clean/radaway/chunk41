  what will also happen right away is the kind of instability that made greece less attractive to invest in than syria . 
  anyway i 'm not an economics major but i would expect all these variables have been included in the math done to reach this multiplier by the imf . 
   greek ministers say the package should save a total of 13.5 bn euros so using a 1.5 multiplier can we expect greek gdp to fall by 20.25 bn or around another 6 % when this is implemented ? 
  how will that help their debt to gdp ratio ? 
  am i doing some kind of math wrong here ? 
  this does n't seem like a plan that 's meant to actually solve the debt problem . 
  seems like just another step in the spiral of destruction , when these reforms are implemented they will be even worse than they started and then they will have to do more austerity , ad infinitum . 
  i agree , it 's very interesting , i also find it funny how they talk about europe the same way we talk about the us , like it 's the same culture everywhere , everyone in europe this and everyone in europe that , thanks for sharing . 
  well the south are the poor guys this time . 
  their women ? 
  are they like their possession or something ? 
  would you be ok with them being raped by german nazis then ? 
  you 're probably trolling . 
  however , so many americans think that people holding rational sensible views have been brainwashed ( evolution , global warming , age of the earth , etc ) and it 's becoming such a common occurrence of the kind of phenomena described in poe 's law , that frankly it becomes very hard not to take it seriously . 
  they mostly ended when people stopped using the gold standard but since we are on reddit i 'm obviously wrong and they probably ended because people curtailed big government . 
  that 's bullcrap , it is impossible for greece to fix itself . 
  i m p o s s i b l e . they could fix their corruption but that was n't the cause of this crisis , the cause of this crisis were huge balance of payments imbalances that are caused by a flawed monetary zone . 
  greece simply does not have the mechanisms to do what it needs to actually fix itself , they can not print money or control their coin exchange rate , they can not impose tariffs and capital controls , etc. 
  they simply do not have any of the mechanisms traditionally used to solve this kind of problems . 
  so they 're forced to do this crazy and , by now , proven not to work strategy of internal devaluation . 
  why do you think the uk does n't have any problems , they have and control all of these mechanisms . 
  greece can not fix itself , only europe as a whole can fix greece and itself . 
  i do n't really see the similarities . 
  in portugal there is n't that much corruption at the bureaucracy level ( there used to be , but that has n't been the case for some years now ) so unless you 're going to replace our politicians instead of our bureaucrats that would n't achieve much . 
  there are plenty of alternatives . 
  in fact the country in your flag is doing one of them . 
  that 's not at all what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of only targeting immigration if you 're going to justify it using this argument . 
  i do n't think it 's just that , in a lot of african cultures it 's actually pretty to be fat . 
  many of them get fat for aesthetic reasons . 
  i think it 's worse than that , she refuses to admit the provably wrong strategy we have been following does n't work . 
  it just needs more time and a `` bit of strictness '' . 
  for fucks sake that woman is as stubborn as a mule . 
  both things bring more people into the country you just decide one of them does n't count because they 're swiss babies , you 're absurd . 
  both . 
  i do n't see how you can require further explanation , it 's absolutely clear , if the problem is overpopulation immigration is n't the only cause . 
  ok , but then they should also create some sort of one child policy or something like that . 
  brits need to understand that eu functionaires need private schools for their kids , you do n't really think they can mix their kids with the belgium rabble . 
  i 'd like you to be my lawyer !, 
   we really , really fucked up , and no one can fix it but us we need to take responsibility - now '' , then the eurozone will not be fixed . 
  i 'm all for this . 
  in fact i think that slowly we are starting to do it as the discourse has slowly changed from just blaming the corrupt periphery strawman ( not that we do n't have problems ) , to actually facing the problem of the ill constructed eurozone . 
  gee , the world is n't simple , it 's an utterly complex and chaotic system , particularly when we live in such a networked world . 
  things are not black and white and there are no clear goodies and baddies . 
  deal with it . 
  of course the eurozone and it 's members have most of the blame in the euro crisis ; since the eurozone , as it is , is a very flawed system . 
  but yes , right now any fuck up , anywhere , causes problems . 
  in fact i 'm surprised you even question this since what started the fire of the global economic crisis was a housing bubble in the us ( it has nothing to do with us right ? 
  the us does n't even use the euro ) . 
  very few get to ride the `` morality/i did n't fuck up '' high horse , certainly not countries who regionally created a very similar crisis . 
  fine , they can stay on the high horse of not entering the euro ( hopefully it will be more of a pony when we fix this ) , but they certainly ca n't be on the high horse of not fucking up . 
  the euro crisis is definitely caused by the flaws on the currency system and the idiotic response given by the eurozone , i will not deny that , however , both swedish and uk fuck ups made it worse and in part helped trigger it . 
  i 've already done so , by your own admission you guys fucked up in some places , and if you accept my premise that everything is interconnected in this globalized hft world , you therefore have part of the blame in the global economic crisis hence , in the least , you guys made the eurozone problems worse than they would have been . 
  everything is interconnected nowadays , fuckups anywhere affect everyone , your share of the blame in the eurozone problems may be small but it is there . 
  i 'd like to know how many people in latvia think your banks were not an actor in this economic crisis . 
  eheh this also happens here , people love to put everything on top of the table so it 's easily accessible and it does n't get uncomfortable in your pockets while you sit . 
  however , cypriots are doing it wrong , you do not take off or even move your sunglasses , that way everyone can see you 're staring . 
  it 's quite common to see a bunch of portuguese men staring thinking no one knows because of the magic of sunglasses . 
  in the case of london , i 'd say immorality applies . 
  see libor scandal , mexican money laundering , and many others for why . 
  anyway i did n't intend to blame them for the eurozone crisis directly , they are more to blame in the global economic crisis that precipitated this one . 
  i 'm not sure , london was a pretty big actor in this crisis and the swedish lending to their poorer neighbours really messed them up . 
  so maybe the danes can stay for now , i need to uncover dirt on them !, 
  i do n't support entirely blaming irresponsible creditors any more than i support entirely blaming irresponsible debtors . 
  that said , to me , the important point in this article is for people , everywhere in europe , to get off their high horse . 
  everyone fucked up . 
  i said ** we ** !, 
  we as in europe , not my people . 
  i did n't think it was necessary to clarify as it was patently obvious which amount would be enough to solve the problem , not just our problem ( portugal ) but all of our problems ( europe ) . 
  which could easily be solved with a little over a trillion which is pretty close to the 7 year budget . 
  does n't matter anyway . 
  you know what 's funny , with only a little more than this `` budget '' we could actually solve this economic crisis . 
  i propose 0 euro budget and we use the money to pay txampion our denbts . 
  sure , some subsidies could stay in place if they 're for modernization or r&d but for the most part aye , only subsidize first necessity food and only so far as necessary for the deemed necessary established capacity to be maintained . 
  i can agree with most of what you said . 
  if they are clear about their goal , and this is it , of course the measures need to fit . 
  some inefficient ( market wise ) farms will have to be subsidized to keep some production capacity but it indeed should be a more holistic policy . 
  i did n't want to argue the causes of the crisis . 
  that 's another discussion where i think there 's plenty of blame to throw around and where in my opinion you 've told a very small part of the story . 
  what i meant with `` course ( ... ) that brought us to this point '' was europe * solutions * to the crisis once it started . 
  * solutions * that actually made it worse . 
  your solution is a possible one , although i do n't think it 's palatable without a lot more federalism which could take years we do n't really have . 
  there are some solutions we could use in the midtime if they were n't blocked by the same stupid ideas that insisted on the current wonderful tactics . 
  above all , europe needs to stop the blame game , be flexible , fluid and willing to try other ways to solve this . 
  this way does not work . 
  please stop fucking babies . 
  i actually agree with the french , if there 's one thing this crisis has shown is that agriculture should absolutely be subsidized as it is of extreme strategic importance much like oil and natural gas . 
  a minor example of this can be seen in greece where one of their problems with leaving the euro is not being self sufficient in terms of food , which strategically makes them weaker on negotiations with the troika . 
  on a larger , global level , the same logic can be applied to europe , we do not want to get pressured into doing something because the chinese wo n't sell us rice or the americans their corn . 
  at this point , it really does n't matter if they do it right by cutting expenses or wrong by raising taxes . 
  at this point ** any ** austerity is having a huge pro-cyclical effect , even worse , the system has gone into a feedback loop as when we do austerity the netherlands , france , and others decide to do it too so they do n't lose competitiveness to us so we ca n't even get competitive and lose potential buyers for our products . 
  right now i feel as if we were in the middle of a currency war in europe , but instead of every country trying to devalue their coin as in the usual currency wars , each country is trying to make their population the most miserable . 
  europe should either change course on the idiotic policies that brought us to this point or disintegrate already . 
  can you be a little more specific ? 
  for instance :  holiday and christmas bonuses calling these `` bonuses '' is certainly wrong , since - they 're not bonuses - they 're just how the wages are divided trough the year here . 
  here 's a [ mirror ] ( http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/improving-prospects-for-the-eurozone-s-survival-by-martin-feldstein ) i 've found, 
   he wrote that he firmly intends to stay in greece until the officers who attacked him , and their superiors , are punished . 
  i laughed at this . 
  yet another nail in the greek coffin , the commentators on the article do n't seem to grasp that it does n't matter if this is representative of the greek population or not . 
  no one wants to visit a country where you can get randomly attacked by the police or some other crazies .
