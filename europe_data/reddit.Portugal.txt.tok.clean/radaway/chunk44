  try reading what i type . 
  the main point is that you guys collaborate with the us , even having an extremely unbalanced extradition agreement with them , yet you have problems cooperating with the much more civilized eu . 
  the only sort of precedent - tv links - was considered to be doing nothing illegal so it certainly is . 
  you insist on debating the details of an example ( of you guys collaborating with the us ) instead of the original point . 
  that 's quite debatable , however [ most of your countrymen ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/07/09/odwyer-extradition/ ) agree that there is no case under uk law . 
  anyway , my original argument remains , why would a country that has no qualms dealing with the us ( a clear human rights violator ) in this kind of stuff , have a problem with the eu . 
  the case i 'm talking about is , funnily enough , an extradition signed by ... guess who ... drum roll ... theresa may !, 
  so they deport people who have done nothing illegal under uk law to the united states , a country that has more men than women that have been raped due to their wonderful prisons . 
  yet , they have a problem with cooperating with eu investigations ? 
  i do n't see the logic . 
  btw this is the same theresa may that has just ignored the results of an in-depth study saying they should [ decriminalize drugs ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/15/decriminalise-drug-use-say-experts?newsfeed=true ) because she knows better . 
  what a piece of work . 
  in portugal there are [ lots ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcchglxyhno ) of [ places ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltftpiyxlso ) where a siren plays every sunday at 12 to test it and we 've never been air raided as far as i know . 
  so , agreed , this is pretty common . 
  you 're ashamed ? 
  i felt pretty nice about it . 
  just shows how much we have in common culturally . 
  you may or may not have gotten the [ reference ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s13e12-the-f-word ) . 
  when i say `` these people '' , i also mean specifically the guys in this protest . 
  can we start calling these people faggots/fags now ? 
   if this were true i suppose there would a massive immigration of southerns to the north err this is happening right now . 
  the only reason you do n't see as much portuguese as you could in the north is because we are n't that many to begin with and lots of us immigrate to former colonies due to the language barrier . 
  spanish have a similar option in their own former colonies , you will probably see a lot more greeks , since they will face a language barrier anywhere they go they might as well stay in europe . 
  just this year portugal will have something like 150k people immigrating when this year ends ( 120k last year ) . 
  trust me , people are getting out of here like rats leaving a sinking ship . 
  i ca n't even find the words . 
  wtf !, 
  what 's next ? 
  making immigrants carry some kind of symbol or better , following other eu countries great example , a differently coloured id card . 
  think about it , all gd will have to do is to request the id card of passersby and they would know who to spank . 
  ffs ... 
  it 's particularly stupid in the case of the uk . 
  eurozone countries really have no alternative unless the policy changes at the european level . 
  i ca n't understand what it 's being said , so it seems to me like she just keeps going like it 's nothing . 
  if that 's the case that 's pretty impressive . 
  it most definitely will , since it appears europe is n't changing the strategy yet . 
  the soviet union , much like the us , financed revolutions and regime changes throughout the world , many times causing civil wars that lasted decades . 
  countries in the eu have in fact been peaceful , and the eu has not been a factor causing strife outside as far as i know , quite the contrary . 
  if all this is due to the union is debatable but , if you 're going to give a nobel to an union , europe certainly deserves it more than the united states or the soviets for fucks sake . 
  well he would think that would n't he , if zombies can even do that . 
  i do n't think atomickoala wants just a balanced budget . 
  i think he wants a number of reforms he does n't believe will be done unless they stay in austerity . 
  if austerity was n't totally obliterating my country 's economy i might want the same . 
  i find this very odd , greece should be a very competitive place to have a business after all the austerity they did ... 
  anyway , enough sarcasm :  it added that the move would improve access to equity and debt capital markets and increase its flexibility in raising new funds . 
  this is clearly the crux of the matter , no one wants to lend to a greek company at fair rates . 
  this has been happening in portugal since the crisis/rescue started too . 
  our companies are moving mostly to the netherlands , they like the low taxes there apparently . 
  you 're as tired of the `` oh it was n't us '' as we are of the `` it 's all your fault '' . 
  both sentences are obviously false , yet you use that acronym because you believe the latter one to be true . 
  anyway , i 'm tired of asking germans and others to stop using that acronym . 
  i 'm tired of explaining where it leads . 
  what bothers me is that , if the situation was reversed , i am 100 % sure the portuguese reaction would be totally different . 
  i really have trouble understanding you guys . 
  so you 're saying you guys accepted this deal as much as the greeks had met the criteria to enter the euro , as in , only really really making it look that way . 
  seems to me to be quite the double standard given the hard time greeks get from you guys about that . 
  what happened was bullshit and you know it . 
  the way i imagine it in people 's minds `` pffft , i 'm not even going to dignify this with a response , downvote '' . 
  europeans are pretty arrogant . 
  i did n't downvote you ( in fact i think i 'm going to abstain from downvoting in this topic ) , but i almost did . 
  saying `` i support this because i 'm a christian '' is pretty lazy intellectually . 
  make up your own mind and give us [ decent arguments ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dowzy-vkafi ) . 
  they actually ca n't or they are very hard to because economics lacks proper lab controls ; you ca n't , for instance , actually repeat an experiment independently . 
  there 's some hope that with [ the birth of virtual economies in mmo games ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/28/the-economics-of-video-games/ ) , they may be used to run experiments in a more controlled setting and in a much shorter timeframe . 
  source : i 'm not an economist, 
  why not just alphabetic order gips or giips . 
  if you think the ordering is innocent or just funny and without repercussions you 're quite naive . 
  that acronym obviously has a meaning , an intention , and furthermore it results in reinforcement of an idiotic stereotype in countries not in it , and resentment in the countries that are . 
  you know , the first time i saw journalists and commentators using it i thought the same thing you did just now - these people have no journalistic or political credibility . 
  imagine my surprise when everyone in europe thought this was perfectly acceptable . 
    but is that piglet merkel  i wanted to stop reading here . 
  the moment you compare people to animals , you have lost all political credibility . 
  could it be the author is mad that people have been calling the troubled countries pigs since the beginning of the crisis ? 
  anyway this seems satire ( with a few small grains of truth ) to me , and that way of referring to merkel is quite ironic . 
  it 's kind of like the cosmological constant in einstein 's equations , you just need to tweak it to make things fit . 
  economic models have like dozens of such constants so you can tweak them to make them fit , surely , ** surely ** , the model is n't wrong ; you just did n't tweak it right . 
  they think they 're painters or something . 
  it 's almost like the people , working in these projections and plans , choose the numbers they will use in their models after they 've already made a decision for ideological and political reasons . 
  yes it was n't included by chance , we 're all on the titanic . 
  sadly my country appears to be on the bottom floor and has insanely drilled a few holes before the iceberg even hit . 
  thank god the ecb is n't quantitative easing or it would be the red crescent trying to help them . 
  edit : meh not sure if people do n't get my sarcasm or i 'm just not funny, 
  i do n't think it 's just that . 
  this crisis is being , until now , pretty good for germany . 
  they get negative interest rates due to all the capital flight , they get to loan us money at high rates , they get to keep exporting and even raise their exports due to a low euro caused by our depressed economies , they get to shift debts greece and others had to their banks to the ecb , etc. 
  when people see them doing so well in the middle of this crisis , warranted or not , it 's bound to create some resentment . 
  not that i see much of it here , we 're too busy getting angry at our shitty politicians ( quite warranted ) . 
  you do n't know that . 
  i never said it would be better if we exited , the point is that the difference would n't be that big nowadays and it will be even smaller by the end of 2013 unless the economy seriously picks up ( doubtful ) . 
  so at some point it does need to be considered as an option . 
  not so sure about that , in a year from now we could very well be where greece is right now , with 25 % unemployment or so . 
  anyway , if things get really bad i 'll just move to another country , i will certainly not stay here and suffer it . 
  in fact , official stats show 100k-120k people leaving the country per year and that was last year , that means it 's probably more like 150k now . 
  most of them young , highly qualified , hardworking and with very little blame for this crisis . 
  do note , that this is a huge amount of people given our reduced active population . 
  after everyone who can actually do something has left the country ( because they do n't like to work for the peanuts they get after giving the rest of their reduced salary to the government in taxes ) i 'm not really sure who the troika is planning to tax to get their money back . 
  either way , what this all means , is that we might not exactly be there yet but , at the rate we are losing good people , we 're not very far either , maybe 1-2 more years of this and we 're done . 
  ahahah counting names and assuming equal female population ( when males tend to emigrate a lot more ) ahahah this is the most ridiculous newspaper ever . 
  yes it is , i could make such a story about an individual in any european country , ** any ** !, 
  there are individuals exactly like this guy everywhere .
