  if anything this could mean the reverse , stocks going up could be a sign that people expect the currency to devalue so they want their money in assets that rise with inflation . 
   who according to those new measures will pay 31 % 31.7 % sigh ... 
  no not really . 
  otherwise you would also be spanish , if we 're going for what the romans called the iberian peninsula . 
  the problem might be that there are n't actually any spanish people . 
  this is the kind of bullshit castilians and catalans are worried about . 
  let me assure you , they do not think it 's bullshit at all . 
  this comment sucks , but it 's your cake day and you 're the resident troll , so have an upvote . 
   barroso , wants to be the next president of portugal . 
  well that 's your choice i guess . 
  i 'm certainly not killing , dying or even going financially miserable for it , no matter how much i like it . 
  we have been doing so , china has recently entered our top 10 , but it takes time to build business partners and relationships . 
  we certainly ca n't , for instance , replace the percentage spain has as fast as their austerity will make them reduce imports . 
  it does n't help that the euro is way overvalued for us , which makes it harder for us to export to outside the euroarea . 
  it 's also pretty impossible for everyone in the world to have a trade surplus and the other countries are ready to devalue their coin and implement protectionist measures . 
  not saying it ca n't be done , but it certainly takes time . 
  nope , you should work for nothing as all your wages go to pay interest of government debt . 
  or , as i 'm beginning to seriously consider , gtfo of this country . 
  which is a shame really because i actually like it here . 
  that would be great if we had someone to export to , our biggest trading partner is spain ( 27 % of our exports ) who is doing and preparing more austerity as we speak , 6 of our top 10 export destinations are european ( accounting for ~ 75 % ) and are all doing some kind of austerity measures as we speak . 
  this is going to be a huge race to the bottom as everyone in europe tries to sell stuff cheaper to their next door neighbours . 
  the portuguese public broadcasting station has 2 main channels , what is being planned is the sale of one of them . 
  yep , this also places a huge burden on people with small salaries as the percentage you pay for social security is the same no matter what wage bracket you 're in . 
  not sure what we 're aiming for here , should people work and give all their money to the government or something ? 
  why would people even work here ? 
  this is insane . 
  the milk disguises the acidity so it 's a pretty good fix when your coffee sucks . 
  if you add milk and sugar , any coffee seems decent ( if you like cupcakes ) . 
  i may be patronizing , but in my experience , all i said is true . 
  you can not get a decent expresso outside these 2 countries , unless you get lucky in an italian restaurant . 
  otherwise , the coffee will be either 1 . burned and disgusting or 2 . horrible to begin with . 
  i 'm pretty ok with having an external european entity forcing some changes as a condition for the help , but none of the members of the troika is exactly democratic and that is a little scary to me . 
  i 'd much prefer , for instance , if the changes came from a council of european finance ministers or something like that , at least they were elected somewhere . 
  not that beggars can be choosers ... 
  apparently , portugal or italy were n't one of the eight countries you 've been to . 
  outside those 2 countries your best chance for a decent coffee is actually in italian restaurants , not in macdonalds or starbucks who have horrible coffee even in countries where the coffee is good . 
  seriously , starbucks was the best you found ? 
  perhaps , i think that 's what the fiscal compact might be good for . 
  forcing governments to do this in good times , so we do n't need to do it during the bad when it seriously harms the economy . 
  of course , my faith in european treaties and institutions is n't at an all time high and i 'd guess that may be true for a sizable portion of europeans . 
  here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zj8hk/golden_dawn_neonazis_tearing_apart_an_immigrants/c653ltu frankly i do n't think it makes any difference though . 
  this is disgusting and the greeks should n't let these idiots do this . 
   that is a fine for the dog owner i believe there is a fine for the dog owner anywhere in europe , at least there is one here . 
  like i said in my post the reverse also happens `` they think our streets are dirty '' , and many times you would be quite right , although that has improved quite a bit . 
  exactly , thanks for clarifying that it does have more meanings , and in fact `` what is shameful is killing and stealing '' would be a better translation . 
  the main meaning , of course , is that there is never a reason to be shameful of honest work . 
  it seems to me that the dutch private sector is simply deleveraging like everywhere else in europe after the 2008 crisis . 
  unfortunately european politicians decided governments should deleverage at the same time as the private sector and that the ecb can do very little to help ( that may have changed ) . 
  since their main trading partners are in the same shithole it will be hard to use exports to compensate the internal market contraction . 
  i find it very hard to see how any economy can grow in these conditions and i 'm actually surprised that they are doing so well given how bad things are . 
  i really respect and admire people like this , life threw him a very bad set of cards and he 's doing the best he can . 
  there 's no shame in cleaning toilets , my father always said to me `` what is shameful is to kill and steal '' . 
  that said , i laughed at this :  swedes are n't as tidy as greeks . 
  eheheh , i think most southerners know this feeling if they ever venture anywhere north of paris ( paris included ) . 
  it also happens in reverse , they think our streets are dirty . 
  however , when it comes to personal hygiene and your own home cleanliness , southerners are borderline ocd . 
  it must be the heat . 
   no point getting our hard earned money stolen from retards money gotten by stealing from retards is ** not ** hard earned money . 
  you seem to be generalizing the opinions of the seemingly crazy group of people you live surrounded by to the rest of the german people . 
  when faced with contradictory evidence like polls you create a conspiracy theory . 
  dear sir you may be on the brink of developing a mental illness . 
  he must be right , i must have imagined that portuguese banks lost a couple of billions with the greek restructuring . 
  i thought your `` we are doomed '' post was sarcastic . 
  apparently not . 
   as for the radioactive natural parks , surely keeping humans at bay by radiation is the worst possible way of balancing the ecosystem , is n't it ? 
  quite the opposite , nature has no problem with a little radiation , it 's only men with it 's obsession to live 150 years that cares about it because they might have cancer a few years earlier . 
  take a look at what used to be a city . 
  it is now a [ beautiful ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruben_solaz/2770833123/in/set-72157629370161102 ) [ forest ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruben_solaz/2770826291/in/set-72157629370161102 ) . 
  trust me , nature ca n't get enough of this shit . 
  it is n't , but if you start treating individual members of a religion with hatred and intolerance then that 's bigotry . 
  of course , the moment they themselves display intolerance and hatred then the gloves are off , and it 's debatable if some muslim communities have n't started doing exactly that . 
  also , i do n't include not forbidding some particularly nasty habits of some religions in the things that we have to tolerate not to be bigots . 
  because i like my planet , the planet itself uses the same system , what do you think geothermic energy is ? 
  what do you think creates mountains and volcanoes . 
  that 's right , radioactive heat . 
  i also happen to think global warming is a fucking serious problem and nuclear is the only available solution to it . 
  also i believe my * patent pending * technology can safely keep the spent rods , and heat not only your water but also your home . 
  it took years to develop , it 's called a block of cement . 
  another technology i 'm trying to sell to costa rica , and other countries with big areas of forest they wish to preserve , is radioactive natural parks . 
  after seeing the great ecological effects it had in chernobyl where nature is thriving - apparently not caring for a little radiation . 
  i 've became convinced radioactive contamination is easily the best thing that can happen to any ecosystem as it keeps humans that would ruin it at bay . 
  seriously , the green party is completely crazy to not want this . 
   bigotry towards muslims is bad certainly , any bigotry is bad . 
  i think there 's plenty of racism in europe and / r/europe but being anti-islam is not the same as racism as islam is n't even a race . 
  i 'm against all religions and superstitions does that make me a ** huge ** racist ? 
  i can very much understand that people do n't want islamic extremists in their backyard . 
   build a nuclear plant 100 metres down the road from my house if you wish . 
  just please stop adding fossil fuel burning capacity to europe 's grid . 
  and please greens , focus on your real enemies . 
  yep , and then you can send the nuclear waste to my backyard where i will use it to [ heat my bathing water ] ( http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/tilghman1/ ) . 
  seriously , if everyone had a spent nuclear fuel rod in their home no one would need a water heater . 
  the energy savings would be gigantic !, 
  i do n't see how this is news , it seems like a very very minor incident . 
  damn norwegians corrupting the greeks !, 
  eheh , i hope you guys find it and the norwegians were probably the best choice given their know how . 
  damn i love that shit , the only thing i do n't like about lisbon is how hard it is to get a decent one here . 
   portugal has been very slow to perform reforms no , it has n't , look at any of the past troika reports . 
  we were quite on schedule with the `` plan '' . 
  you are intellectually dishonest and invariably make up facts to support your opinions so it 's a waste of time to argue with you . 
  no , and i never said that , what 's racist and rather stupid , in my opinion , is the current narrative of what caused the problems ; what 's racist and rather stupid is , also , trying to deal with an economic and financial problem like if it was a moral one , a moral failing of the south .
