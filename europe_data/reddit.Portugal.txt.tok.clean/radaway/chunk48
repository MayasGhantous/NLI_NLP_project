  also comments by people like you saying :  based on experiences in portugal and greece , it seems that we need to reconsider our options as member states themselves seem to be incapable of executing tasks given to them . 
  when portugal ** did ** execute the tasks given to it . 
  the plan was simply bad , yet your stupid stereotypes and a troika like unwillingness to admit your worldview sucks , make you think that it was somehow the southerners that did n't implement it right or simply cheated about it . 
  i do n't think it 's just the [ media ] ( http://euobserver.com/social/32431 ) as can be seen by this recent [ poll ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/poll+majority+of+finns+see+finland+as+racist+country/1135269860316 ) where they found : in the view of one in five , `` it needs to be recognised as a fact that some nations are more intelligent than others '' . 
  so , indeed , clearly not the majority of the finns but still , a significant group in this young nation think they 're better than the rest because they just so happen to be doing well right now . 
  certainly enough to create an impression on those of us who are targeted by their foolishness . 
  so , we do everything you asked for , and more , as we needed to do to get the troika to lend us the money , now that the economy is tanking as could be quite expected , it 's our government 's programme ? 
  the troika followed a stupid ideology instead of sound economic theory , they expected their measures would restore credibility and then the markets would magically lend us money again . 
  when in the end all the markets care about are fundamentals that got worse due to these measures , not some stupid ass shit idea of germanic credibility . 
  the portuguese massively believed them , stoically accepted any amount of pain and did it . 
  they did it because , they did want to be credible , they wanted to show we were not just some corrupt southern european country , they wanted to be respected by the other europeans again , and they did it because they certainly did n't want to default and the troika was their only chance and these were their terms . 
  now it 's not the troika 's programme ? 
  go fuck yourselves , you fucking stupid bastards running libertarian ideological experiments on my country . 
  at least admit , it was your fucking plan and your fucking plan sucked !, 
   @uat2d please do n't do this . 
  this is n't tweeter for fucks sake . 
   obeys the rules , does as told . 
  i think this is pretty much it . 
  most countries doing well have this kind of culture . 
  i 'd say the americans and brits also have it by the way , they just need a little propaganda to remind them why they should do this once in a while . 
  of course that , as a portuguese , this idea is abhorring to me ; which is probably the problem we have here . 
  sadly , you need a nation of robots to be a successful society nowadays . 
  for instance , one time i was in brussels waiting for the pedestrian signal to turn green to cross the road , with something like 20 belgians waiting for it too . 
  there were absolutely no cars in the road for as far as the eye can see , so i just crossed it . 
  the belgians looked at me in disbelief , and then a few brave souls did the same - running quite fast and smiling - like if they were rebelling or something . 
  belgians are n't even the most strict rule followers in europe , so this probably only happened by chance , but i think it illustrates the different mentalities . 
  a portuguese only follows a rule if his common sense tells him to , while lots of other people in europe just blindly follow them . 
  it 's not just being different . 
  they refuse to integrate or mix , and are actively discriminatory against the locals . 
  i would not include most africans/blacks or gays with the other groups i referred because most of them do not have a culture that is intolerant of the local culture , and they mostly mix pretty well . 
  i really do n't know why you went blacks and gays on me anyway , i was talking about integration problems that stem mostly from idiotic iron age cultures , not colour or sexual orientation . 
  not all differences are the same . 
  that 's like the exception that confirms the rule . 
  as you say they did not integrate in antwerp , hence once in a while they create small uproars which could eventually lead to hate . 
   except of course that the overwhelming majority of roma in hungary , which this story is about , are not immigrants at all they mostly are n't emigrants here either , the problem is that they never integrated . 
  that 's why i say they 're the ultimate emigrant that does n't integrate . 
  the sad truth imho is that roma are the ultimate emigrant that refuses to integrate , they 've been doing it for centuries , and that breeds hate by the local populace . 
  jews had the same hate problem and they certainly were n't street thieves and beggars . 
  now a few islamic cultures are having the same problem . 
  i certainly do n't know how to solve this without these people actually changing their shitty tribal culture of not mixing . 
  in my opinion we stopped hating jews because they either started integrating ( they 've done this particularly well in the us ) or went to israel to be crazy zionists . 
  while the others do n't do the same , i do n't see a solution . 
  ahahah not really i 've always considered myself * slightly * right leaning , at least , fiscally and having a tendency to prefer the free market and private property , etc. 
  i liked this test a lot more . 
  according to it i 'm a [ neoliberal democrat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smxiz.png ) 6 percent of the test participators are in the same category and 48 percent are more extremist than you . 
  not sure if i 'm happy with these results eheheh . 
  i certainly do n't consider myself neoliberal , can someone explain to me what 's a neoliberal democrat ? 
  i dislike the socialist party as much as the next guy , however , adding that and disclosing that he 's socialist party is actually pretty intellectually honest of him , and it is the proper way to give your opinion . 
  you should not hide your bias if you possibly have one . 
  the funny thing is that i usually consider myself , if anything , right leaning ; at least in fiscal matters . 
  yet some people in reddit present such a ridiculously extreme view that i feel like i 'm almost left wing . 
  anyway , i upvoted you and thanks for helping me understand wth is going on here . 
  sigh , you 're like a troll that gets upvoted and makes me think poorly of this entire subreddit . 
  as if the very reduced number of factors you picked are the only ones that really matter . 
  of course things were fucked up , but we 've been doing a lot to improve them since then . 
  anyway keep doing whatever you need to do to keep your manicheistic view . 
  yes , there 's a big difference in how things developed if you were going towards communism under titoism . 
  anyway portugal was n't communist and did n't have much of those either . 
  your simple test , and your simple arguments is all you really do here . 
  the world does n't work like that . 
  slovenia was part of yugoslavia , it had always been one of the richest parts of yugoslavia , and yugoslavia was n't exactly communist , more like a socialist federation under what you could call [ titoism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titoism ) . 
  not that you 'd care for this kind of subtleties ... 
   for me its just nice to see where opinions are coming from i very much agree , hence why i keep the flair . 
  i just wish people here had better reddiquette . 
  ahahahah it 's just a acronym no reason to be pissed about it . 
  he 's not , he probably just got sick of having his flag flair influence the direction people vote on his posts . 
  which is a serious problem in this subreddit in my opinion . 
  seems to me like it 's just a matter of banks . 
  how healthy they were and how much of the economy they represented . 
  it seems silly to compare them to me anyway . 
  you erected quite a lot of strawmen there , you did n't see me defending a single point of what you 're talking about . 
  the private sector is deleveraging , it will be deleveraging for some years . 
  you are studying economics , care to explain to me how we will avoid deflation and decades worth of recession without public spending using ecb funds ? 
  where is the money to pay for your wages going to come from ? 
  if no one is spending money no one is earning money and your economy pretty much freezes like it 's happening right now . 
  do note that i agree with you that countries with structural problems like ours need to keep reforming . 
  what we do n't need is europe wide austerity which makes it impossible for a country like ours to ever recover , even if we do all the necessary reforms , as all our main trading partners are n't buying the shit we make either . 
  there 's no reason for dutch ( or germans fwiw ) to be doing austerity and it puts the entire eurozone into a race to the bottom where we will all be living on 300 euros per month . 
  obviously ... he had a lot more upvotes than downvotes at the time i posted . 
  frankly he still has too many upvotes anyway . 
  your post is both irrelevant to the topic at hand and presenting as simplistic a view as the post you replied to . 
  yet you 're upvoted , / r/europe at it 's best, 
  verbal aggression ? 
  wtf ahahahah you guys are ridiculous . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  you actually think people should n't be allowed to offend one another with words ? 
  you 're an arsehole !, 
  i 'm correcting you because i 've seen you make this mistake before . 
  it 's not * dept * it 's ** debt ** . 
  dept is an abbreviation of department . 
  it probably would surprise you how high the taxes in portugal are right now , and how high they already were before this crisis . 
  there are a few homeless near where i live , institutions already know where they are , they refuse to leave the streets . 
  i 've seen nurses taking care of their feet and other people taking care of them . 
  if your homeless is a long time one , institutions probably already know where he is and probably already tried to take him out of the streets , but many of them have mental illnesses , traumas , addictions or just do n't want to integrate into society any more and refuse . 
  they 're still followed and helped from time to time . 
  i buy `` my '' homeless lunch in my street 's coffee sometimes , they 're not that bad , just not exactly right in the head . 
  there are plenty of sources , as a citizen of a country under one of these `` bailouts '' i would n't expect you to need them because it 's been the same everywhere . 
  imf trying to do it right and eu ideologues demanding more pain than necessary and fucking things up . 
  here 's a [ source ] ( http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/11/52207 ) anyway . 
   said that the imf mission staff in the troika sought to distance themselves from a `` counterproductive set of austerity measures '' imposed on the country ** under the insistence of the eu side ** ( emphasis mine ) i could get plenty of more sources .
