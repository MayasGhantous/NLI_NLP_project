  i was trying to show how ridiculous that was but your iq was too small to grasp it . 
  a lot of poor folks and small companies are heavily indebted , inflation will help them , it will also help the troubled countries regain their competitiveness as they would get less inflation than the non-troubled who are not doing austerity . 
  anyway , i do n't really care about the morals , although it is quite immoral what a lot of poor folks are suffering right now without qe , i am a pragmatist . 
  this is how we can solve the crisis . 
  moralists such as yourself can decide who gets the money . 
  m\u00fcgeln ( germany ) is a town with a lot of racism , therefore , racism and ignorance haunt northern europe . 
  none of the data in your sources has anything to do with the reforms we need to do , or that the troika asked us to do . 
  in fact many of those reforms make all of the indicators , you decided to pick , look worse in the short term . 
  so yes you do not know what you 're talking about and yes we are reforming . 
   case in point , portugal needs to restructure its entire public sector to become economically viable . 
  it 's not doing that . 
  that 's utter bullshit . 
  first of all we do n't need to restructure our ** entire ** public sector as some things work quite fine . 
  second of all , according to everyone from the troika that inspect us quite regularly we are doing very very close to all the reforms that have been asked of us . 
  i 'm quite sure you have some anecdotal evidence to support your claim , you can shove it up your ass . 
  everyone but reddit fanatic libertarians and inflationphobic paranoid europeans knew , from the very start of the crisis , the ecb actually printing would be the only possible solution . 
  i have been so dismayed at how unreasonably europe has dealt with this crisis until now , that it wo n't surprise me at all if draghi 's words are as big and as hollow as europe 's institutions . 
  i do n't really understand your new trolling motto . 
  care to explain ? 
   `` every single fiat currency in history has collapsed , this time will be no different . '' this is like the most idiotic argument ever . 
  we could use it for anything . 
  every single government in history has collapsed , so there 's no point in having one , right ? 
  maybe basf is , i know for a fact that puma and siemens had a terrible year in portugal and they expect 2013 to be a hell of a lot worse , as in almost no sales . 
  i very much doubt that this scenario is n't happening in the other austerity countries and it will keep spreading while things do n't change . 
  anyway , what koleye said . 
  hardly unexpected ... 
  more loans is not necessarily more problematic . 
  as an example it is good to take a loan to pay your credit card debt because you probably can get lower interest on the new debt than you would paying on the credit card . 
  furthermore , when i speak of ecb intervention i would n't ' be speaking of just loaning to us . 
  lets be clear , i think we should keep doing austerity . 
  what i want is serious quantitative easing . 
  i do n't care if the money comes our way . 
  inflation in the eurozone would mean that the people doing austerity ( who would hardly get any inflation since they 're in deflation right now ) would not only get their debts instantly reduced , they would also become more competitive ( relative to countries not doing austerity who would get inflation ) . 
  moreover , it does n't matter . 
  it 's very close to being too late to fix anything and europe has proven ( to me ) during the crisis years , that europeans are a bunch of racist , manichaeistic , ignorant fools , and i do n't really care anymore . 
  in the future years of strife , i expected , i 'd like to be with a group of civilized people , i used to think europe was it - it is not . 
  this announcement would work almost as actually doing it if he was bernanke . 
  not being bernanke and not being the president of an actually functioning central bank this does n't really do anything . 
  another ecb needs to act article . 
   from the perspective of the peripheral countries , there is a real grievance that the creditor countries do n't appear willing to accept their responsibility for careless lending in the boom . 
  not just this . 
  they should also acknowledge that they were irresponsible during the dotcom bubble years and that the ecb helped them with rates lower than the periphery that was responsible during those years needed . 
  it 's only fair in my opinion that for a while the ecb helps solve the problems it helped cause . 
  of course , but it does n't matter because europeans do n't care about textbook macro , they know better . 
  norrsken , you seem to have misunderstood what happened , the greeks did n't just stop paying interest for a while , i 'd agree that would n't exactly be a default , private lenders were forced to writedown 75 % of what the greeks owed them . 
  it was exactly like my example above . 
  of course that by the time this happened much of the greek debt was out of the private sector , but still , that was definitely a default . 
  so if i owe 1 million , and i tell you i 'm only paying you back 250k and you are forced to forgive me 750 000 that is not a default ? 
  dude , you ca n't generalize all the mainland just because of your bad experiences in germany and switzerland , and even in those countries it also depends on the corporate culture of where you worked , it does n't depend only on their national culture . 
  well if the spanish have to bailout their banks in the same way you guys did , it 's not good . 
  basically they had a huge housing bubble and people are afraid they are going to do an ireland . 
  nope , spanish debt was just very low before this crisis . 
  [ i recorded myself reading your comment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vge5k.gif ), 
  i 've suggested many courses of action in this subreddit before . 
  i do n't care anymore , i got my helmet , my trench and my sunglasses . 
  i 'm watching this like people watched the first nuclear tests , i 'm sure the radiation wo n't get to me . 
  i 'm sure this will have no repercussions on other troubled countries , on cyprus ' banks that have so many greek bonds and specially not on countries that are n't experiencing problems yet . 
  trust me , the greek situation is perfectly contained . 
  time to buy a helmet . 
  fun times ahead !, 
  americans had no problem finding lots of economists and others that thought letting lehman go bankrupt would be better for everyone , and here we are . 
  frankly , i think it 's retarded to be against nuclear energy . 
  nuclear energy is the only way we can stop greenhouse gas emissions in a short time frame . 
  if you 're an ecologist and you believe climate change is a serious problem we need to deal with ** right now ** , you should support nuclear , it does n't depend on sunlight or wind and it is very energy dense and so much less polluting than almost any alternative we have right now . 
  it has the potential to eradicate emissions buying us precious time to develop better alternatives . 
  from my pov being anti-nuclear is the same as being pro fossil fuels and melting polar caps . 
  look europeans being shitty at one another , what a surprise !, 
  while everyone is busy finger pointing and saying how much their neighbours suck , the markets are slowly fucking everybody up one by one . 
  all the old divisions are back , southern , eastern , northern , whatever . 
  europeans suck a lot more than i thought before this crisis ... 
  the baltic countries did not start with the levels of debt the currently troubled countries have , i do n't really see how you think it 's possible to pay interest on  100 % debt to gdp ratio while you seriously contract the economy at the same time . 
  basically it 's the same as if you wanted to keep servicing the debt you made when you had a 5000 $ a month job when all you can get now are 1000 $ jobs . 
  you can not do it , so you default . 
  so , yeah , i do n't really see how the internal devaluation propponents think this will solve anything unless they 're also ready to seriously forgive debt by assuming even more losses . 
  in some sectors you need to seriously regulate the market . 
  it would be nice if a pure free market worked for everything but it does n't . 
  for instance , i think we can all agree that natural monopolies need to be highly regulated . 
  the deregulation observed in some sectors prior to the crisis is certainly one of the culprits of what 's happening in the world right now . 
  freedom of choice to kill , steal and rape is certainly bad and some players in the market do things i 'd shelve with those . 
  it seems to me that if anything the numbers can be worse than these . 
  if as you say people were not accurately reporting their income to the authorities , they would be declaring less - not more - so they would pay less taxes . 
  i do n't know why you 're are being downvoted , it 's a fair question and point . 
  no it is not . 
  pensions have pension funds which pretty much rise with inflation if they are even mildly well managed and wages eventually catch up . 
  as for your savings you can easily protect them from inflation too , if you do n't do anything with them frankly you 're as much of a drag on the economy as the highly indebted and should lose some of their value . 
  if inflation is theft , so is deflation as it basically steals assets from the indebted and gives them to the savers at reduced prices . 
  whatever ... reddit is filled with crazy libertarians and it seems europe is too and these are the shackles that keep the eu in our current predicament . 
  i 'd like to see them after you have the data in a somewhat pleasant to look at format . 
  now you 're just trying to keep us out , [ this is our best try ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jpryzv1r70 ) . 
  i 'm up for that , in portugal we eat a lot of [ sardines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardine ) so it 's not a big stretch . 
  i have to agree , it almost seems like they picked the worst examples possible in the community to speak , i sure hope it is the case . 
  thanks for the sources , i only had time to read the article you linked and he makes some interesting points . 
  but he also says `` however , the problem is that the ecb still has n't applied the brakes , even though the world economy has recovered . 
  '' , i really do n't see how you could think the economy had recovered in 2011 . 
  i also think that he overestimates the chances that gips will stop doing the necessary adaptations and downplays the risks of the adaptations being done too quickly . 
  still , i 'll read more when i get out of work because he does seem to have some good points too . 
   his calculations include money that has already been spent -- like funds for greece . 
  but this money also includes amounts that are primarily intended as a deterrent -- like the money in the permanent bailout fund , the esm . 
  finally , it includes items for which collateral has been furnished or interest is being paid . 
   sinn is comparing apples and oranges .
