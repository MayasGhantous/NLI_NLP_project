  and what makes his apocalyptic calculations even more questionable is the fact that he withholds the costs of the alternatives . 
  in a worst-case scenario , the euro zone would collapse if politicians heeded his advice . 
  the fiasco could cost the germans $ 3.3 trillion , according to a recent report by the german council of economic experts . 
  purely based on this article , this does n't seem very thoughtful to me . 
  seems like he just wants the world to work the way he wants it to , and uses copious amounts of information bias to stick to his guns . 
  i am , of course , open to you and other german redditors , that know him better , to enlighten me on this by teaching me more about his opinions . 
  yeah , because social mobility only depends on your smarts . 
  as someone who lives in lisbon , this scares the shit out of me . 
  the average earthquake lasts between 2-4 minutes , the 1755 lisbon earthquake lasted 8 minutes and destroyed 85 % of lisbon 's buildings . 
  8 fucking minutes and that 's not counting the aftershocks !, 
   that deflation will be counteracted by the inflation caused by printing money . 
  it would but that only means that unlike you previously said , we are not as exposed to high inflation because we start from a deflationary position . 
  i 'd like to know how you are calculating those numbers , it seems to me that you are using a per year basis in some of them while using the total in the others . 
  the yearly budget of both the health and education ministry is around 8 billion euros so i 'm very confused with your numbers . 
  countries like portugal ** are not just as exposed to inflation ** , we had ** -0.21 % ** inflation last june , that 's not inflation , that 's deflation . 
  ergo what you said is just not true . 
   the portuguese government is cutting on education , information , health , wages , etc. 
  these cuts reduce the deficit only by a fraction of what other cuts would . 
  again not true . 
  education and health are by far the biggest expenses in our budgets , therefore any cuts to any of them wield the biggest deficit reduction per the law of diminishing returns . 
  i do agree we have a croonyism problem , but the rest of your post seems mostly propaganda . 
  you 're quite wrong . 
  it would be precisely the opposite . 
  the troubled countries would experience very little inflation due to their austerity measures , while the core countries would have bigger inflation . 
  therefore the troubled ones would regain competitiveness quicker and in a much less painful way than what is currently happening which people call `` internal devaluation '' and involves not only everyone losing purchasing power but a lot of companies going bankrupt too . 
  inflation by printing would be the best thing that could happen to us . 
  in my opinion this is really the only solution at this time . 
  we ca n't do debt forgiveness , we ca n't do eurobonds and i doubt they would be enough at this time , we ca n't politically do jack shit in europe . 
  just print the damn money , lets have some inflation and carry on with our lives . 
  historic revisionism - deal with it - all the other europeans have learned to do it , it 's not that hard . 
  yeah but the unemployed we are talking about here are not people with 15-16 , they are twenty somethings with a degree . 
  they are mostly still living with their parents since they have no money , but that 's like the only thing in common . 
  i 'm not saying this could n't work for a few people , without some college , to learn a trade , but it 's not really a solution for spain . 
  ahh the solution for spanish youth unemployment - working for free - genious . 
  have you not noticed all the countries with negative interest rates ? 
  he seemed to be defending the social democracy , that europe is losing , to me . 
  the maths are the same , you are just changing the base . 
  much more problematic is - how would we get 2 extra fingers ? 
  i suggest we change to base 8 instead , it 's computer friendly and we do n't really need our pinkies . 
  yeah you 're right it 's a moral issue . 
  usually people use the word `` pegged '' by the way . 
   on account of not being part of the euro exactly . 
  indeed , that 's why people keep saying we need more europe , which is one alternative , the other is that everyone just goes their own way . 
  while the factors you have chosen are certainly very important . 
  do you think your country would 've done any better if the ecb had rates much lower than what your country and your country 's inflation needed for a decade ? 
   these countries have lost their economic sovereignty yep pretty much . 
  these plans are not good for us , and they will not solve our problems . 
  however it 's not like we can do anything else until foreign interests say so . 
  it appears you 're right and i was wrong by 1 year . 
  well that sucks ... 
  disregard my last paragraph everyone . 
  ahahah their clothes . 
  sorry , i could n't resist . 
  on a more serious point , i think it 's worse than sch\u00e4uble says - it 's not just the markets - people and countries in the eurozone are losing faith that european leaders and institutions can make the euro work . 
  i frankly do n't know if the eurozone can survive for that long . 
  the delay also seems to throw this decision to around the timeline for german elections which does n't seem innocent to me . 
  in fact it makes it seem like there 's what you would call here `` corruption '' , and judges and politicians are trading favors . 
  i 'm sure i 'm wrong and it 's just my portuguese glasses making me think this . 
  wait a minute !, 
  you 're telling me that if i rub an ordinary tomato ( not a gm one ) i get 3 wishes ? 
  are you trolling me or do you just not understand english ? 
  i 'm saying it is less corrupt now . 
  maybe my english failed me , but what i meant is that portugal is a lot less corrupt ** now ** than it was 20 years ago . 
  i 've edited my post to clarify that . 
  i do n't think the eu handled the greek crisis well * at all * . 
  however if your banks made loans without the proper due diligence and your regulators did not do their jobs correctly , you can hardly blame anyone else if they end up losing money on those loans . 
  of course what europe needs is a better mechanism to deal with our zombie banks than what we 're doing right now . 
  i disagree , i 'm old enough to remember how things were 20 years ago . 
  nowadays portugal is ** a lot ** less corrupt than it was . 
  there are still problems but most of the small time corruption you had when dealing with bureaucracy and other day to day stuff is mostly gone there is also a lot less tax evasion . 
  our justice system still needs some reforms and we still have corrupt politicians but everyone does . 
  sigh ... 
  ** full article : ** finland would consider leaving the euro zone rather than paying the debts of other countries in the currency bloc , finnish finance minister jutta urpilainen said in a newspaper interview friday . 
  `` finland is committed to being a member of the euro zone , and we think that the euro is useful for finland , '' urpilainen told financial daily kauppalehti , adding though that `` finland will not hang itself to the euro at any cost and we are prepared for all scenarios . '', 
  the finance minister stressed that finland , one of only a few european union countries to still enjoy a triple-a credit rating , would not agree to an integration model in which countries were collectively responsible for member states ' debts and risks . 
  she also insisted that a proposed banking union would not work if it were based on joint liability . 
  `` collective responsibility for other countries ' debt , economics and risks ; this is not what we should be prepared for , '' urpilainen said . 
  urpilainen acknowledged in an interview with the helsingin sanomat daily that finland `` represents a tough line '' when it comes to the euro-zone bailouts . 
  `` we are constructive and want to solve the crisis , but not on any terms , '' she said . 
  as part of its tough stance , finland has said that it will begin negotiations with spain next week in order to obtain collateral in exchange for taking part in a bailout for ailing spanish banks . 
  finland has also voiced concern about an agreement reached at an eu summit in brussels last week to use the european stability mechanism ( esm ) to buy bonds to ease the unbearable borrowing costs which are squeezing spain and other vulnerable euro-zone economies . 
  last year finland created a significant stumbling block for the euro-zone 's second rescue package for greece , agreeing to take part only after striking a collateral deal with athens in october 2011 . 
  you can speak german but you ca n't click the [ original ] button on the top right ? 
  frankly , i 'm more of a right leaning kind of guy , but are n't communists all about means of production being shared and against most private property , and nowadays is n't all intellectual property becoming private property and an important mean of production ? 
  you think that 's odd ? 
  the only portuguese guy is someone who was , until very recently , a communist , that later turned socialist . 
  they 're fucking scumbags . 
  their supposed ideologies do n't really matter . 
  in fact , most politicians are scumbags and they know ideologies are much like religions to fool the stupid sheep , they just knew better than vote yes for this . 
  so these guys are not only scumbags but idiots . 
  probably thinks he can troll better this way . 
  the flair is automated right now and easy to change . 
  he 's not greek he 's the resident troll of / r/portugal please do not feed . 
  i meant this :  `` in slovakia , people live of a monthly pension of $ 280 ( $ 350 ) and salaries stand at about $ 400 a month , '' he said . 
  `` it is very difficult to explain to those people why slovakia contributes to assisting countries where ... wages stand at $ 3,500 . '' which seems to me to be either a lie , or purposefully misleading people into thinking the slovakian earning 400 $ could get 3500 $ doing the same thing in one of the troubled countries . 
  it certainly could n't here as that is almost 5 times our average private sector salaries . 
  i can understand the sentiment but ...  contributes to assisting countries where ... wages stand at $ 3,500 where the hell does a slovakian earning 400 $ for a job can get 3500 $ for the same job in the countries having problems ? 
  this ca n't be right . 
  right ? 
  and if it is n't true why reinforce the already problematic public opinion problem with lies .
