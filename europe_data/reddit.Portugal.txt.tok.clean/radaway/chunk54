  there are german idiots just like there are idiots everywhere . 
  sadly , it seems german idiots are being taken advantage off by bad politicians , journalists and bad book writers . 
  ahahah i warned you, 
  i really liked this one , [ anthony bourdain `` no reservations '' in lisbon ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ntd1dqezmo ) , do n't watch it without a full belly or you 'll suffer . 
  would n't surprise me at all , it 's not like the ecb was n't working strictly for the german economy until this crisis started . 
  it 's not like doing that actually caused a lot of the problems in the periphery and it 's not like the bundesbank and the ecb are like 9km away from each other . 
  whatever ... 
  joseantoniosaraiva is / r/portugal most famous troll , do not feed it or we will have another txampion on our hands . 
  big surprise ... only banks and agriculture get bailouts/subsidies in europe because of their `` strategic importance '' . 
  i have no qualms about portugal policies being reviewed by fellow europeans . 
  in fact they have been and continue being reviewed as we speak due to our bailout terms . 
  what i have a problem with is that you do n't want a federation what you want is a confederation where based on the historic coincidence that you guys just happen to be richer when it formed you hold all the power . 
  what we need is a true federation with strong federal institutions that will not only control the `` immature '' but also make sure the others do not overstep their bounds like they 've been doing this whole crisis and you seem to feel entitled to . 
   perhaps lifting retirement ages to a `` federal '' level would be a good start . 
  if germany , netherlands , finland etc say `` 67 '' then that 's what it fucking is . 
  the legal retirement age in portugal was raised from 65 to 68 well before this crisis . 
   the political life in many areas of southern europe seems so ... immature ... somehow , that i 'm terrified of letting them vote on things that really matter . 
  i 'd say you are the one who seems immature , your whole post consists of you giving opinions of things you have little understanding or knowledge of , and you denote an infantile generalization appetite that lumps southern and northern countries all together like if they are all the same . 
  furthermore , you need to understand that what you are proposing is not an use , it is turning the troubled states into protectorates , so please go fuck yourself . 
  they do if they 're spanish or italian . 
  ahahahah at the retarded people in the comments feeling offended because they do n't realize it 's mostly a joke . 
  germany is starting to look like the eurozone countries that already asked for a rescue , who denied everything until the very day they asked for help , except in those countries the politicians can use the excuse that they wanted to calm the markets whereas german politicians are just fooling their own electorate . 
  if german voters do n't know yet that we are either breaking up the eurozone or doing eurobonds/printing money/etc and that the narrative they 've been told until now about their economic miracle and the lazy south is a lie , they 're about to be very surprised very soon . 
  pretty poor poll in my opinion , it does n't talk about monetary policy at all . 
  apparently all europe can do is fiscal policies . 
  ahahah 100 $ you better live close to it . 
  ^ modern day descartes right here, 
  it really does n't matter how it was accumulated , or how our debt to gdp was low . 
  the point still stands that the development that happened afterwards was in no small part simple squandering of what was there . 
  i 'm not speaking about portugal only , i was thinking worldwide , just because i have a portuguese flag next to my name does n't mean i think in terms of our little rectangle . 
  however , even in portuguese terms you can see that life stopped being hard for them , precisely , because they started borrowing like hell , selling our gold , etc. 
  it all crashed because they * fucked * what they had * borrowed * instead of investing it intelligently . 
  see our debt to gdp and our gold reserves in 1974 when we had our revolution and then tell me it 's not their fault again . 
  my grandfather did live most of his life under a fascist dictatorship , however the meaning he got from it , and i think it 's what 's intended from the story , is that friends and family have to stand by each other if they do n't want to be broken one by one . 
  a lesson europe should , in my opinion , learn . 
  if you like scenery , i think it 's worth it to spend 2 days in both porto covo and sagres , they 're both small towns , you will stop there to explore the things around them , it 's easy to park and sleep in your car in both places and the beaches you can explore there are beautiful ( [ example ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=praia+da+cordoama&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;rlz=1c1svea_pt-ptpt485pt485&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=0mngt6_clokh0axprky_dq&amp;ved=0cfgqsaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667 ) ) . 
  i 'd start in `` lisbon '' , go down the `` costa vicentina '' , stopping in `` porto covo '' , then go down until `` sagres '' . 
  then i 'd go right until `` sevilla '' , then `` granada '' , `` valencia '' and finally `` barcelona '' . 
  go by the side roads and visit beaches all along the way , they are spectacular . 
  that trip would be awesome . 
  edit : oh just noticed you had a rough plan , the only thing i 'd change is to follow the coast line more closely in portugal it 's really worth it . 
  the ruling generation in europe apparently failed to grasp the meaning of the old story my grandfather used to tell me as a kid . 
  i think it 's an aesop fable - the bundle of sticks . 
  you know which one i 'm talking about , it 's easy to break a stick , but tie a few of them together and see if you can . 
  sigh i 'm starting to hate the generation that now has ~ 50 years they totally fucked us up , keep fucking us up , they are greedy , uneducated , impolite , racist , selfish and stuck in idiotic left and right ideologies . 
  it is ** definitely ** not because of barroso , that jackass fucked us up . 
  people keep using this disgusting acronym like it 's acceptable and it annoys me to no end . 
  i 'm glad at least one of us is able to find some humor in it . 
  who the hell even repeats this ? 
  i know americans keep making stupid slogans to feel proud of themselves but this is almost as stupid as creationism . 
  bread and circuses ... 
  that was a great read , i wish people like him were a choice in the ballots . 
  i think it really depends , for instance , i think portuguese voters would take this opinion into consideration . 
  however , portuguese are not like the greeks . 
  we do n't have in our culture that much fear that foreign interests are trying to fuck us up or much nationalism , for that matter ( maybe we should have a bit more of the former ) . 
  totally , this is like merkel supporting sarkozy in the french elections . 
  foreigners recommending candidates to highly nationalist populations like the french and the greeks is completely idiotic . 
  let 's not make an important subject , we should all be united against , blurred by blending it with 20th century ideologies . 
  between this , cctv cameras , airport x-rays , deportation of citizens to the us , etc. 
  the uk is becoming quite a scary place . 
  what people in the uk need to understand is that privacy is ** absolutely fundamental ** to liberty . 
  if you do not have privacy even if you think you 're free now since you live in a democracy with the rule of law , you are no longer free because at any moment you can get an extremist governing you that will use this collected data to retroactively punish you . 
  if that 's a limitless , as in no download limits connection , that is an awesome price . 
  but yeah i might have exaggerated the price because it usually includes television and phone services for that much . 
   steer the titanic while on the ocean floor ah , now there 's a good analogy if i ever saw one . 
  hey !, 
  that was n't a sign up for reddit libertarian university . 
  printing money is , in my opinion , the best way to deal with systemic debt without throwing the baby away with the bathwater . 
  you 're , of course , entitled to your point of view that would have everyone defaulting , because somehow you think lots of good companies that had nothing to do with this would not collapse too , and would not cause a destruction of wealth that would take half a century to recover . 
  we are not in the gold standard anymore we can always print the money . 
  i do n't see this as unexpected at all , the internet is one of the cheapest , if not ** the ** cheapest , forms of entertainment , for 30 euros or so a month , you get limitless hours of entertainment ; so when your budget for entertainment is very small an internet connection is one of the best investments you can make . 
  i know they continue to have serious deficits , that why i said [ primary deficit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_deficit ) . 
  which is in the order of 2 % . 
  so if they really default and stop paying all interest they would have very little more austerity to do in terms of budget cuts . 
  yes they would have other problems but it 's certainly becoming a possibility . 
  that 's just not true , their budget has almost no primary deficit right now . 
  so the problem really is that their economy is contracting due to austerity while the debts keep increasing due to interest . 
  why issue eurobonds , just let the ecb print the damn money and then the banks can pay it back to the ecb and slowly remove it from circulation . 
  eurobonds are no longer a good solution in my opinion because the state debts are already so high that anything that makes it worse will mess the banks ( who are full of european countries debts ) balance sheets . 
  which is starting to seem preferable than what they 're getting right now . 
  they can not devalue , they are ruled by foreigners they did not elect and they 're getting a ton of austerity anyway . 
  yep they just have n't done enough austerity , they need a lot more if they do n't want unemployment to rise even further . 
  well it certainly does n't all work the same way , because in portugal the official numbers are almost always lower than the reality even if you discount for some kind of shadow economy . 
  bro , mcafee sucks ass . 
  can someone overlay this with the average hours worked per week ? 
  i did not suggest we let these banks fail . 
  there are many ways europe could have used to save spain and irish banks and this way was certainly the worse . 
  spain is going to do austerity when they already have 25 % unemployed ? 
  that 's going to work . 
  depressing your economy to make your debt to gdp ratio worse , that 's going to help . 
  this is a bank bailout all right , but spain certainly was n't bailed out . 
  so now we 're going to fuck the 4th biggest economy in the eurozone , there 's no chance that this could cause problems to france and italy . 
  europe is crazy . 
  well european bailouts certainly do n't look nothing like the american ones particularly in how much interest the countries getting them have to pay and associated austerity . 
  although , the spanish seem to have gotten a deal that makes it look a lot more similar . 
  eheheh ok , carry on, 
  i quite agree, 
  you need to escape the parenthesis in your links using a \\ before them or use res which does that automatically for you . 
  i also do n't see why you feel motivated to troll / r/europe but i guess every sub needs a troll . 
  my first really regular contact with british newspapers was on / r/europe i guess i gave all of them the benefit of the doubt with the exception of the dailymail .
