  so the greeks must know what consequences might await them if they choose not to cooperate anymore , the politicians in greece must be cowards not to tell their constituency what might be happening if greece choses poorly . 
  but of course the far left and far right like to tell fairytales in order to get elected . 
  i agree with you on this point , and i find it very odd that we keep hearing the statistic that 78 % of the greeks want to stay in the eurozone and they vote for parties that want to break a deal they made with said eurozone . 
  i guess i just hate the way politics are done nowadays . 
  it would be innocent/fair/honest if brought on during the first or second bailout negotiations deal . 
  during those times this hypothesis was described as unthinkable ( well not so much after the mess with the referendum in the 2nd but it mirrors the current situation ) . 
  of course it was n't , but they hypocritically said so , and now when the greeks are trying to form a government it suddenly becomes very thinkable . 
  this is something that needs to be negotiated with the greeks as there is no mechanism to simply kick the greeks out and should have been brought on when the parties were at the table . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't . 
  did you even write this in reply to me ? 
  who is avoiding uncomfortable thoughts ? 
  what i 'm doing is noticing that the timing of all these greece out of the eurozone news does n't seem innocent or coincidental . 
  i believe the greeks will have another chance at voting in who we tell them to vote before this happens . 
  so it does n't surprise me that mainly germans have been producing this kind of news , probably to scare the greek population and try and influence the result . 
  it 's not like they did n't try to influence the french elections too . 
  yeah it 's pretty much an argument you can use for any expense , it 's also used by people to sell you stuff in small installments - see how little you pay monthly - in the end you are bankrupt all the same . 
  i think however it 's also making the point that it 's not just germany who is paying for this . 
  did anyone seriously think otherwise ? 
  slow news day ? 
  do note , i do n't think and seriously hope , nothing like what is talked about here ever happens . 
  i 'm just answering the question . 
  the treaty of lisbon allows for member states to leave of their [ own accord ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_vi:_final_provisions#article_50 ) . 
  there is no provision to expel a member state , but you can '' [ suspend ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_i:_common_provisions#article_7 ) '' them , which would kinda force them to leave or become complete pariahs . 
  simple , there would be a huge capital flight from all the other troubled countries , the pressure on them to freeze every bank account and get out of the euro in the very same day greeks do it would be quite big in my opinion . 
  i 'm pretty sure the governments of ireland , italy , portugal and spain , have plans ready to do that if they want . 
  what will make them ( or some of them ) decide to follow the greeks or not would be the answers to the questions `` has europe really helped the greeks enough and they 're the ones to blame ? 
  are the greeks such a special case ? 
  if they drop greece wo n't they drop me ? 
  will the ecb compensate the capital flight by sending a huge amount of money my way ? '', 
  this event would obviously include a lot of defaults on debt denominated in euros on foreign banks or a forced conversion to a coin that would seriously be devalued in a very short time frame . 
  banks all over europe then collapse . 
  now not only is the periphery fucked , everyone is fucked . 
  i 'm seriously quite scared that this kind of scenario is indeed possible and this is a very dangerous poker game being played between greece and germany . 
  we are already getting all of those things , except doing them trough inflation hurts a lot less than the current route . 
   basically put , your suggestions are insane . 
  that 's just like your opinion man . 
  no sane ruler would ask that in a referendum , that 's like an announcement to get your money out of greece - right fucking ** now ** . 
  no , what a sane ruler would do is freeze everyone 's bank accounts and change their money into drachmas overnight . 
  if the greeks think they will get a referendum and time to think about this they 're crazy , the sane greeks either do n't have any money , are in debt or have moved it out of the country long ago . 
  yeah someone should check my ass before i ride the bus or the subway too . 
  this is ridiculous and offers no significant security . 
   it makes everything - be it your house , your car , your bank account - worth less . 
  no , it does n't . 
  those kinds of assets follow inflation pretty closely unless they were overvalued to begin with . 
  even in that case , inflation helps you because it brings your asset price closer to the stupidly high price you paid for it * . 
   the problem is we 're are not investing not because of lack of incentive but rather because lack of credit . 
  very true , and the lack of credit comes from very bad loans made before the crisis , inflation makes the money in those loans worth less making the debtors credit rating better and it 's an incentive for savers to loan . 
  both of these things result in more credit . 
  anyway the real reason i want inflation , the higher the better , is because with our austerity policies we would have very little of it , and it is the fastest way for the periphery to become competitive with the central/nordic economies that would get some inflation since they 're either not in austerity or doing a lot less of it . 
  the added benefit of doing it this way is that if your wage goes down due to inflation your home loan follows it . 
  where with austerity what you get is that your wage gets lowered and then you ca n't pay your loan and then the bank goes kaput and then the country goes kaput and then it 's not funny . 
  in summary , i want austerity in the periphery and inflation in the eurozone as a whole , it seems the best solution . 
  \\* edit well obviously your bank account gets worse with inflation , that 's the point , make something with that money . 
  it does n't make anyone poorer it just means , if you 're lazy and do n't do nothing with your wealth you get poorer , as , in my opinion , you should . 
  about damn fucking time !, 
  do you think people do not work 10-12h a day where i live or in greece ? 
  they do . 
  tell me ** one ** country in europe that did n't make some kind of bullshit in their books , yeah the greeks clearly did it worse with the help of a few bankers but still . 
  you seem to be the one riding a very high horse . 
  i only blame the rest of us as much as i blame the rest of europe for nazis rising in germany due to the treaty of versailles and other humiliations . 
  there are other reasons of course , like having people like merkel and sarkozy that the greeks have not elected , making decisions for them and the rest of europe . 
  i could go on and on . 
  i think it 's quite sad but rational that they are voting nazi or extreme left since the center parties refuse to represent the concerns greeks have , namely , that the deal they have does not solve their problem and that their country is being pillaged by being forced to sell everything at very low depression prices . 
  this is what you get when you humiliate people the way the greeks have been humiliated . 
  people calling them lazy , corrupt and thieves . 
  people showing them contempt and condescension instead of solidarity . 
  i hope you 're all happy with this disgrace . 
  people wonder how the nazi party got voted to power in germany , this is how . 
  it could happen to your country too . 
  frankly i have a hard time believing anything . 
  your current president ( yanukovych ) has clearly tried to steal elections before ( not the last ones , the 2004 ones ) which makes me suspicious of him and anything your government says . 
  frankly , you also seem very biased , are you ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm not saying she is n't a criminal but it all seems more like a mafia war than a justice system . 
  anyway i 'm upvoting you because someone downvoted you without any proper reason that i can see , and it 's nice to hear opinions from someone there . 
  ah this story is amazing , so only now do you realize how much she missed you ? 
  sincere `` awww '' . 
  it 's a little more than `` nostalgia '' which we also have . 
  you are not just reminiscing , you actually would really , really , like to be doing something again and sometimes you feel extremely sad if you keep being deprived of it . 
  for instance , the feeling you get when you are away from your country for a long time is not just nostalgia , you actually miss it and would like to go there if possible . 
  for many poor emigrants it is their dying wish to go back at least one time more . 
  i 'd say `` nostalgia '' is to `` saudade '' as `` liking someone '' is to `` loving someone '' . 
  i found it pretty boring but can you point a few examples of where it 's bullshitting ? 
  exactly , and look at all the fat american redditors downvoting me . 
  get out of / r/europe you macdonalds loving rednecks . 
  the reporters nowadays ... spain is filled with beautiful women and they pick this photo ? 
  all i can think is `` menos culo tambi\u00e9n caga '' . 
   to help countries like spain to become more competitive without having to go through internal deflation , the ecb should increase the inflation target . 
  the value of the euro needs to go down , wages in the more efficient economies need to go up , while the others try to hold theirs stable . 
  this has seemed to me , since the crisis started , as the only/best solution . 
  the others wo n't even have to try very hard to keep their wages stable because you can/should keep doing a little austerity . 
  sadly , it appears europe is full of crazy ron paul politicians which is odd because i know very little people in real life that actually defend his ideas in the eu . 
  eh good point, 
  do n't most universities have classes/tests in english when there are erasmus students ? 
  you might have that option if you want to stay . 
  still i find it pretty admirable how well they coped with the oil money , they could have become a corrupt failed state like many other countries with so much oil . 
  i love jeux sans fronti\u00e9res and those human body cartoons , i still suck at french \u2639, 
  yeah we were n't used to low interest rates , so specially the private sector went a bit crazy . 
   a dutch downgrade would be greeted with no small degree of schadenfreude in certain south european capitals . 
  no , it would n't .
