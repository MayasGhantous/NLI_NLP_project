  so biologically you can say there are no human races , in fact , that 's what a large majority of biologists say . 
  however , `` races '' certainly exist as a social construct . 
  the op title is misleading . 
  the 3 % is for , and i 'm quoting the article here , the `` retail and service industries '' ; which are not all the norwegian employers , and it 's a sector where obviously it is much more important to be able to speak norwegian . 
  i 'd also guess the question was made in such a way as to invite a negative response because 3 % is ridiculously low . 
  my final evaluation rates this article and statistic with a gold medal of `` daily mail quality '' for successfully making people angry with foreigners . 
  that 's not what an agnostic is , an agnostic is just someone who thinks it 's impossible to really ** know ** the truth about god ( s ) , almost everyone in the world that is n't crazy is an agnostic does n't matter if they 're theists or atheists . 
  maybe apatheist ? 
  poland is about as catholic as portugal is and we eventually got it . 
  i 'd say any countries that already have some kind of state union for gays are very likely to legalize it in the near future . 
  it 's usually just semantics since these state unions normally are pretty much equivalent to marriage in legal terms . 
  in 10 years probably all of the european union . 
   that guy with the glasses is clearly an asshole there 's something we can all agree with . 
  the police and the internal affairs ministry are both investigating the issue hopefully he will be punished . 
  portugal is not close to the usa politically , culturally and certainly not geographically , even if you account for our islands . 
  so ... what the hell are you talking about ? 
  i also disagree with you saying that we are close to a banana republic , but from reading your other posts on the subject it seems you think our populace is stupid/ignorant and you 're the one eyed man in the land of the blind . 
  according to the police and some eyewitnesses , the protesters started throwing objects at the police , namely rocks from which the lisbon [ sidewalks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_pavement ) are made . 
  the police charged the protesters and the particular police guys that made this aggression must have been particularly stupid or adrenalin pumped because she was clearly a journalist with a huge photographic machine . 
  i have to say this is very unusual for portugal and not a good sign at all , we had much bigger protests without any violence not long ago , protests are fairly common here and portuguese are usually mild-mannered . 
  edit : i changed the sources of the information a couple of times as i read more about it . 
  i think you 're right , i clearly misread that . 
  well that certainly makes a lot more sense , still i doubt the trip that used to be free stopped being free for everyone . 
  obviously you do n't care about facts so no point continuing this argument . 
  maybe i was impolite , however , i did provide factual evidence ( in portuguese i 'm sorry [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) ) whereas all you have is anecdotal evidence from `` friends '' which , i 'm sorry , but is not worth much . 
  i 'm also not downvoting your posts because i think they contribute to the discussion something you do n't seem to be reciprocating . 
  well the article and your story are pretty odd because according to [ this [ pdf ] ] ( http://www.acss.min-saude.pt/portals/0/20120125_faq_em%20actualiza%c3%a7%c3%a3o.pdf ) recent document from the portuguese ministry of health . 
  diabetes consults are specifically defined as not paying fees . 
  according to the same document the model we are using makes it so 5.2 million portuguese ( half our population ) are exempt from the fees by economic insufficiency , you just need to fill this simple [ form . 
  ] ( http://www.acss.min-saude.pt/portals/0/mod.rieitm%20-%20acss.pdf ) so i 'd say you 're full of shit and an entitled bastard . 
  just because they were n't paying anything does n't mean they should n't if they can easily do so . 
  it 's important to know that if they charge the woman in the first example so much for the treatment it 's because she can easily pay it . 
  the amount they charge is proportional to how much you earn , and it 's supposed to moderate how much you use the service , not pay for the treatment . 
  having some form of fee is the only way to make people be responsible in how much they make use of a service that is pretty much free . 
  there are no fixed charges like described in the article they 're all progressive and based on your income ; minimum wage people certainly are not paying at all . 
  no one is being priced out of public health and this article does n't seem very well researched at all . 
  i do n't get it . 
  would n't life in prison in an ukranian prison be a much , ** much ** , worse punishment ? 
  everyone speaks english but the french dude . 
  typical eheheh . 
  nowadays a big gas find is 25-30 years of romanian consumption at current rates ? 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's great for them and i 'd love to see that happening here , but , damn peak oil sucks . 
  dude i said 19 ** 5 ** 3 what i was talking about : [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_german_external_debts] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_german_external_debts ), 
  what does you guys only finishing paying in 2010 , almost a century after the end of the war , tell you about how generous the terms you got in 1953 were ? 
  btw you were the ones that decided to pay it ( if you can call doing it over such a big span of time that ) , i do n't know why because you had already defaulted on it in 1930 . 
  i agree with you - probably not . 
  at least not * de facto * . 
  europe is in troubled waters right now and there are no easy solutions so it 's good that no one is getting too rigid about following any single economic idea . 
  i kind of admire this about europeans . 
  it 's like we have a better grasp of subtleties than most . 
  if you actually follow keynes you 're supposed to do austerity during the good times and save money so you can then inject money into the economy during the bad times . 
  the problem is that most countries did not do this . 
  i always thought germany was not following hayek , it was simply pro keynes done right , which can lead to similar results if there was no saving during the good times . 
  i 'm actually concerned now because if what is in the article is true that means you guys want to do some kind of crazy libertarian experiment with europe and i 'd rather not be a part of that . 
  how did no one helped you ? 
  germany had tons of debt forgiven during the 20th century . 
  thought -  taught anyway , i think the reason it 's hard to have good relations with russia is that they 're crazy nationalists , much like americans but with more booze and corruption involved . 
  that makes it , in my opinion , a lot harder for countries with an history of war with them to feel anywhere close to comfortable with having them as neighbours . 
  obviously , the point is that this is not an isolated incident like in vondi 's story , it is company policy . 
  i agree with you but , if you read the whole article , it appears this is company policy so it 's not just a dimwit . 
  the cow takes many minutes to die and sometimes the blood coagulates and it 's even worse , so there 's that . 
   the party has called ritual slaughter a `` barbaric '' practice well ... it is . 
  frankly i do n't see why we have rules for chicken living space and then allow this kind of things . 
  probably invented by the same dumbasses that brought you black history month in the us, 
  * textile, 
  i was afraid the cdss would fire , given that most ratings agencies already have greece on selective default , i guess the risk of catastrophe is so big , the entity responsible for saying cdss are to fire wo n't dare doing it . 
  maybe the lesson for the banking industry is that cdss ( like many other amazing financial instruments ) are bullshit and wo n't protect them , so they need to start paying attention to whom and how they loan their money like in the good old days . 
   so this reply does n't actually help this reply helped quite a bit thanks ; if you ever find the article with the dastardly plan edit this post or something . 
  can someone explain to me why does n't the ecb take part too ? 
  i mean they even changed the bonds the ecb had ( in greek law instead of the uk one ) to make that even further impossible . 
  it did n't even have to participate to the lengths the private bondholders are going to , but i really do n't see how this will solve the greek problem with only the private bondholders participating . 
  it 's even stranger because most of the bonds the ecb has were bought quite cheaply due to the state greece is in . 
  so they would n't even lose that much . 
  it 's like the ecb wants to have a profit , i really do n't get it . 
  did the ecb leverage on those greek bonds or something ? 
  maybe i should be asking in [ / r/explainlikeimfive ] ( / r/explainlikeimfive ) because i 'm getting really confused with europe 's solutions for greece and all the accounting magic going on . 
  less than that as many of the signers were not european . 
  still , it 's a pretty significant number for a petition , even an internet one . 
  not the waiter 's fault see the guy walking behind him at 0:08, 
  i have already defined what i meant [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/q2u11/injured_french_and_english_journalists_among/c3uaqon ) and thanks for thinking we should have some freedoms . 
  the word ** agonistes ** , found as an epithet following a person 's name , means `` the struggler '' or `` the combatant . '' it is most often an allusion to john milton 's 1671 verse tragedy samson agonistes , which recounts the end of samson 's life , when he is a blind captive of the philistines , described as being `` eyeless in gaza at the mill with slaves '' . 
  the struggle that samson agonistes centres upon is the effort of samson to renew his faith in god 's support . 
  you 'll have more europe but i doubt very much greece or maybe even portugal will be part of it . 
  i 'd say , right now , europe is actively trying to kick the greeks out , given the latest agreement they forced them to sign which is completely impossible to implement and unacceptable for a nation where nationalism is quite alive ( i 'm pretty sure they already think their current prime minister is some kind of georgios tsolakoglou ) . 
  ask yourselves , why would europe force greece to sign a contract that is impossible for them to honor ? 
  while that 's true , merkel only answers to the german electorate , that 's arguably better than none , but given her influence in eu terms i do n't think that makes her any less dangerous than the ecb/imf . 
  oh do n't be obtuse you know what i meant - someone not middle eastern or african . 
  i 'll be more careful with the language next time i guess . 
  they 're not yet for the rest of the region , there was a bit of a refugee problem in turkey but not much more . 
  i think al-asad is trying the bahrain route , repression and killings worked pretty well there . 
  kinda sad that white people have to die for anyone to give a shit . 
  syria reminds me of sudan : 0 oil + 0 white people = 0 fucks given . 
  i guess in the end the syrians will have better luck than the sudanese because they 're still in a region we do n't want destabilized , so eventually there will be an intervention if things start to get too troublesome . 
  [ 1,2 , humm ] ( http://www.designdenhaag.eu/en/sites/designdenhaag.eu/files/imagecache/690w/vlag/579.png ), 
  i usually defend turkey in [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) , because i really think they should have been let in the eu a few years ago , but this is ridiculous . 
  i do n't even think cyprus should invest more in defence because , and i really believe this , all europeans would rally to defend cyprus if the turks ever materialized any of these aggressive posturings . 
  i think it 's the same reason we are one of the few european countries that invests so much in angola . 
  we think that the mistrust is misplaced because we think the mistrust other countries place on us is misplaced , and think that they are like us when in fact the situations are quite different . 
  i think that portuguese also think they have a knack for dealing with shady people and so they think the risk is smaller for them because they know how to navigate the murky waters of corruption . 
  when in fact corruption in portugal has been getting lower every year precisely because we stopped culturally being like that a long time ago .
