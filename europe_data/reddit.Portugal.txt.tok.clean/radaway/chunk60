   coupled with savage austerity was not working after two years of crisis well this is surprising . 
  pfft ... 
  austerity does n't work if not a single one of your main trading partners is following a more expansive economic policy . 
  where the fuck is the demand going to come from for the greek or any other economy to grow . 
  well by that definition you 're right , since security services are inherently conservative , however , right wing can also mean libertarianism , free market , capitalism , etc. 
  anyway , my point is , this left and right division gets more idiotic everyday if you had said ** conservative ** i would n't see anything wrong , and clearly you can have conservatives on both sides . 
  exactly , this interview seemed like a summary of everything that 's wrong with europe . 
  the only european institution they talked about was the ecb , apparently the ecb and merkel/sarkozy are the only thing that matters . 
  there are different definitions of genocide you can `` balance '' , given that by some definitions what happened to the armenians was not genocide even though they were eliminated in much the same way . 
  so ... what about the kgb ? 
  how much gdp did estonia lose in 2008-9 and are they even close to that now ? 
  portugal , does n't really have a big reason , we had small versions of everything that went wrong in other places that are fucked up right now . 
  i talked about it in this [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/mnuy6/portugal_debt_ratings_cut_to_junk_status_by_fitch/c32f39r?context=3 ) and you can add a small real estate bubble to the list because i apparently forgot about it in that comment . 
  in that comment 's context maldrake also makes a very good point which i recommend you read if you 're interested . 
  i 'm very glad someone 's doing well and it gives me a little hope . 
  demand needs to come from somewhere , if anyone is going to recover , and it 's certainly not going to come from the countries in austerity which are quickly becoming most of the eurozone . 
  downvoted because i really do n't see what this is doing in / r/europe, 
  yes that is true , uneducated , poor or stupid people tend to have more children ( idiocracy is a good movie btw ) , however , if europe had let them in before the shift started , it would probably never have happened , because of all the embrace and extend policies europe has . 
  for an example , look at hungary right now . 
  basically , my theory is that being in a group ( specially one so diverse as europe is ) where everyone depends on each other , keeps you from going full retard because we are never all stupid at the same time . 
  anyway , i did add all those `` in my opinion '' , to the first post , because this is all an exercise in hindsight and we will never truly know . 
  in my opinion the only reason turkey is shifting away from kemalism is because europe stupidly ( or worse ) did n't let them in when it should have . 
  kemalists , in their beginning , used europe as a model and in terms of secularism ( imho ) got even better than europe . 
  it does n't surprise me at all that , after all that effort , consciously or not the turks felt offended by a baseless rejection and decided to change trajectory even if it ends up not being good for them . 
   btw , east timor was n't your responsability , at least a little bit ? 
  sadly , more than a little bit , we basically abandoned them and they were quickly invaded by indonesia who feared they would become a leftist state ( yeah cold war stuff ) . 
  our country was a mess at the time due to our recent 1974 revolution but , still , that 's no excuse . 
  i think it 's fair to say the shame portuguese felt for what happened there was a huge contributor to the numbers on that demonstration . 
  thanks for the help in 1640 and the following years , you guys certainly made it a lot easier . 
  as for the demonstrations yes we had one with around 1.5 m people in september 1999 demanding that the international community acted to stop the violence in in east-timor , which , coincidentally , kinda proves portuguese can support countries that want to be independent ( the timorese had a referendum showing massive support for independence ) . 
  i can understand your frustration because he refused to clarify his positions , but you are kinda proving him right when he said he did n't want to discuss it because catalans get angry at him eheheh, 
  fine , good luck with your deadline ( gtfo of reddit ) , i just wanted a bit more information as i 'm fairly ignorant on the details and particularities of this topic . 
  while i appreciate your opinions it is becoming very very annoying that you refuse to give us your rationale for them . 
  there are only 3 real solutions and we are n't doing any of them . 
  ecb prints like hell ( say 2 trillions ) , the euro devalues and we pay our debts with inflation , we would also instantly become more competitive because all our salaries would have been effectively lowered . 
  countries default , even though libertarians love this one , this would suck because it would destroy a lot of innocent bystanders and i ca n't even begin to imagine the systemic effects . 
  true fiscal union , the eu as a whole is not that indebted ( we owe mostly to one another ) . 
  frankly , unless the world economy suddenly booms ( do n't see any reason to think it will ) , until we pick our poison , the ratings agencies are right about europe . 
  humm i disagree , you can make a pretty good expresso for .3 $ or so , i do them in my home several times a day with my [ saeco machine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcdjs.jpg ) , incidentally it is cheaper and much better than the horrible nespressos everyone loves nowadays . 
  no , but i am . 
  i did n't read your post right because i did n't notice the quotation marks . 
  the us was downgraded by s&p a long time ago . 
  britain actually controls their central bank so they have tools to fix their economy the french and other euro nations simply do n't have . 
  * fonctionnaires btw i love that we are now using french when speaking about public workers, 
  agreed , no one in europe gives a fuck about this kind of things . 
   trichet being french and thus prone to poodleing up to the germans & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; heheheeheh, 
   and before someone chimes in and claims that the germans did it in the early 2000 's , yes they did , but the rest of europe and the world was going through arguably the greatest period of prosperity and expansion in recent history , conditions are considerably different now to then so i do n't believe the comparison is valid . 
  this , a million times this . 
  austerity does n't work if all your major trade partners are also doing it . 
  upvote for the great sources . 
  i 'd be careful not to call all the price changes `` speculation '' though . 
  words do have a meaning . 
  no one was speculating with the price of food in your neighbourhood supermarket . 
  in my opinion , they were mostly taking advantage of the one thing that makes markets inefficient , which is information asymmetry . 
  when the coin changed , consumers lost their `` database '' of prices and it was the perfect time to overcharge them . 
  scumbag european : asks for citations ; speaks of a recent study and does n't provide a reference . 
  eheheh all jokes apart , i think the biggest effect is that the transition inflation was very very high for lower priced products ( like an expresso , which everyone drinks a lot of in portugal ) and people deal with them every day . 
  so the perception of inflation was quite high . 
  that said , my googling says there was in fact some transition inflation and portugal did have a high one but it was n't the worst . 
  true , i 'm trusting whoever is lending you at a loss made their due diligence into the legal mess that would happen if the countries made new currencies as i 'm no expert in this . 
  exactly , so if the euro completely collapsed and they got converted to dm the bondholders would see a windfall in profits with a corresponding loss to the germans . 
  so it does make sense that they are paying you a little to hold their money since they do stand to gain in that unlikely event . 
  first answer : yeah a year ago i decided to create another account and have conversations with myself on the internet . 
  you 're a moron . 
  second answer : i used the cursive on ** pur ** pose to point out it 's a negative thing . 
  you 're a moron . 
  [ edit ] if you 're going to correct errors the word you want is `` their '' not `` there '', 
  i did n't thought this one was going to be * hating * , more like lighthearted humour for those who 've seen the real articles on this in other sub-reddits . 
  this board is * infected * with all kinds of people from europe , gives you quite the perspective . 
  denmark is not in the eurozone and has a decent economy , so clearly you can come to the exact same conclusion . 
  in the case of germany , even though it is in the euro , it is expected that a deutsche mark would actually rise in value relative to today 's euro . 
  so yeah i would n't say the market is `` advising '' anyone to ditch the euro but it is certainly hedging against the possibility that it collapses . 
  i do n't understand why he did n't just link to the article , ca n't upvote you enough . 
  i 'm absolutely sure they will try to use it . 
  however , note that i originally said `` true federation '' , if they distort this into some kind of dystopian confederation which they call a federation in a very orwellian way , then of course they could have even more power over us . 
  well a federation actually has a government responsible for all the countries instead of the bullshit institutions we have now . 
  as we are now the states do whatever they want and the bigger ones can bully the others around ( e.g. 
  should we change europe 's name to rhineland ? 
  eheheh . 
  to be fair , if europe became a true federation , germany would have less power in it than it has now . 
  we are talking about insurance and how to evaluate risk now . 
  is that a real commercial ? 
  that 's unbelievable . 
  what else went wrong there ? 
  still it 's no excuse not to have social workers ( i 'm sure they have plenty of them ) to solve these kinds of situations . 
  some people really ca n't afford it . 
  however :  they are asking us to pay a tax that we paid when we bought the house and the constructor paid when he built the house , not sure if true . 
  greeks evading construction taxes was one of the first stories i heard when this crisis started , apparently everyone has a half built floor or something , maybe one of our fellow greek redditors can confirm how likely this is . 
  do n't know why some jerks are downvoting you . 
  you got asked for your opinion , you gave it and even took the time to give some additional information . 
  thanks . 
  btw if people want to realize how important atat\u00fcrk is for the turks , keep in mind that it literally means `` father turk '' as in * father of the turks * . 
  that was n't his real name . 
  i do n't really get why europe is n't doing bofinger solution yet , we already agreed on the fiscal controls . 
  starbatty seems to be a completely insane ron paulesque type who seems to totally ignore the `` chain '' and `` throw out the baby with the bathwater '' effect of his suggestions . 
  to be fair this is the kind of thing that makes people lose faith , there 's a reason politicians are a completely discredited class all over europe . 
  i think that what the turks do n't recognize is that there was an intent of actually destroying the armenians , so in some definitions ( namely the un one ) not a genocide , they do n't deny the killings and what happened . 
  so the '' is probably because the definitions can be a bit blurry . 
   in 6 years they were able to almost double our ** debt ** ftfy, 
  he did do that , but he also ignored the deficit for years until it was too late , we were being warned about it at least since 2002 ( although you can get an earlier date if you consider people that started warning us during guterres ' time ) .
