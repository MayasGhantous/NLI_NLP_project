  he also did stuff like the `` magalh\u00e3es '' and what , in my opinion , makes him clearly the worse , he bought the 2009 election by raising the wages of public workers , an act later replicated by fellow socialist ant\u00f3nio costa in the c\u00e2mara municipal de lisboa . 
  and i have n't even talked about the many scandals of corruption he or close friends/family were involved in . 
  so yeah definitely the worst . 
  has my english failed me ? 
  i 'm not a native speaker but you do n't seem to be answering to what i meant to say . 
  [ edit ] do notice that the article of this submission talks mostly about target2 and germany and really has nothing to do with the uk . 
  what the fuck , does the uk have to do with what was written in that article ? 
  seriously , i 'm pretty much an europhile and think the uk has been wrong in many occasions , but , i 'm getting pretty sick of these constant cheap shots at them which are promptly answered with stupid europhobe articles from the telegraph or something . 
  this subreddit is becoming very very annoying . 
  yeah i noticed that one too . 
  it seemed like the author decided to use the deadly sins theme before knowing exactly what he wanted to say , so he made up that one to get 7 . 
  the others seem reasonably on the mark , although , most of these are stuff every country does , or tries to , and these are like examples of states that got really good at it . 
  where 's part 2 ? 
  i was enjoying this list . 
  [ edit ] nvm [ found it ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1294161-europe-s-seven-deadly-sins-22 ), 
  ahahahahhahah sesame street needs this , she can be the new bogeyman or something . 
  yeah that 's why i asked you , since you 're serb there was a chance you either knew or could find something . 
  i would n't say that following orders or defending your country is an excuse for civilian massacres though . 
  was he responsible ( partially ? ), 
  for civilian massacres or not ? 
  it 's kinda the only point that matters i think . 
  i 'm all for paying for the shit we did , i was n't whining about that - at all - however , when they put us in a situation where we will never be able to pay our debts because the ecb keeps running the way they want instead of how at least 5 countries want . 
  that is debt slavery . 
  if they wanted us to pay them back ( which we actually want and are trying hard to do ) they would go a very different route , you do n't need to be a genius to know what deflation does to economies . 
  i 'm more concerned at what they are doing to us right now . 
  first they spread the narrative that we are lazy and profligate ( which the piigs acronym you use helps btw ) and then they force us to solve our problems trough deflation during a fucking world economic crisis . 
  any serious economist can tell you that what they are doing to us is going to cost us very dearly in gdp terms , it will take us decades to recover and we will probably have to default in some our debt this way ( as its percentage to gdp grows ) . 
  the alternative which would be a little ecb driven inflation for europe is not even considered because the germans got fed both the previous narrative and the stupid analogy to weimar republic and the german masses , like all the others , are stupid as shit and like to be told they 're better than the rest . 
  if i was a conspiracy theorist i 'd say they used propaganda very well , to make us debt slaves and rule the eu using the punishments in the recent treaties to take our vote rights away forever . 
  a what ?? 
  for the benefit of those not getting the reference [ the moon is a harsh mistress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moon_is_a_harsh_mistress ) . 
  it 's a pretty good book btw . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/360434/god-bless-you-captain-hindsight ), 
  `` elect '' ? 
  lol . 
  democracy does n't really work in places with such a huge percentage of the population directly dependent on the state , all it takes to buy an election is to raise pensions , unemployment benefits and/or public workers wages in election year . 
  certainly almost everyone in europe has noticed at least the first symptoms of this problem as a very big public sector is not exclusively a greek problem ( although they certainly refined it ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the other greeks , not dependent on the state , were busy either helplessly gnawing their teeth at what was happening to their country or evading taxes so they would not feed this horrible state beast anymore . 
  if you 're worried you should n't be fleeing just from greece , you should be running from the euro and europe altogether . 
  if there 's anything this crisis has shown is that you can count on 1 . 
  european politicians incompetence 2 . the utter lack of power of europe institutions and 3 . 
  which together make europe a very risky place to have your money right now . 
  this not happening is what makes me think that maybe the conspiracy theorists are not paranoid and maybe they really are out to get us . 
  the market has already decided eurobonds will not be enough , why else is everyone getting rating downgrades , the ecb needs to ease . 
  i do agree with the above posters that controls need to be in place , i just do n't understand what the fuck is taking so long , march ?!?!? 
  for fucks sake . 
  if only europe had an institution with the firepower to end this bullshit speculation ... bah not even sarcasm gets me happy ... 
  i do n't see what 's wrong , she 's not a psychopath , is n't that a good thing ? 
  not that surprising , botswana is pretty awesome . 
  of course it does , like the article says 40 % of their exports go to eurozone countries and the figure for eu countries is even higher . 
  emerging markets are not big enough and do not grow fast enough to absorb that . 
  furthermore many of them have complications like tariffs . 
  this is actually a pretty admirable speech , i do n't know how well liked this guy is but in this instance at least , when europe clearly lacks brave politicians and when nationalist rhetoric is on the rise , poles should be proud . 
  you ** can ** borrow your way out of debt . 
  countries need to do a rollover of existing bonds as they expire to pay them , if the market forces them to do that with horrible interest rates you get into a vicious circle . 
  the * bailouts * in europe supposedly allow the countries some time with lower than market interest rates to fix their finances in a way that they can then become sustainable , i do n't see what 's so hard to understand . 
  basically it 's like asking a low interest loan from your bank so you can pay the credit card which has a huge interest rate and later you pay the bank because your salary is enough to pay their monthly payments when , for the credit card , it was n't . 
  iceland is a very poor example as they effectively ** stole ** many europeans by not giving them the same guarantees they gave to icelanders and had committed themselves to also giving to foreign depositors . 
  iceland is , in my opinion , a rogue nation until they decide to pay what they owe to eu citizens . 
  abolishing the euro would be absolutely ruinous for everybody , not just the bankers . 
  as it happens , the bankers have a lot more means of protecting themselves in such an event , than the little guys and small businesses , so it would n't be as ruinous for them . 
  apparently you have a lot of references so it 's not like you do n't want to be informed , perhaps you are suffering from [ confirmation bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) and should try to broaden your views . 
  they die in jail ? 
  an eu treaty is impossible in a short timeframe as it requires all 27 members to agree ( besides you have the uk there :p ) . 
  it 's about damn time in my opinion , i do n't know why we have been delaying this for so long , letting the crisis get worse and worse and spread to country after country . 
  i would also happily welcome an european level fiscal control on my country finances which , and i agree with the germans on this , should go hand in hand with any ecb unleashing . 
  sure you can , my backyard is not very big but one or 3 barrels will be ok , i will use them to heat my bath water . 
  and another feedback loop begins ... 
  people rarely try to be biased . 
  when you say the general consensus is that our `` bailout was completely uncalled for and unecessary '' you 're clearly being biased in your interpretation of what the consensus is ( maybe it is among your group of friends or family ) , as the facts do not agree with what you say . 
  in fact it does n't matter if it was the markets that fucked us up ( which i do n't think is what happened although the markets certainly took advantage of our fragility ) , without a lender of last resort we needed the bailout or we would n't have any money right now . 
   and if general consensus in portugal really is that the bailout is unnecessary it ** is n't ** . 
  dudewhatthehellman seems to have a very biased opinion , the general consensus was made pretty clear in the last election , where 80 % of voters gave their vote to parties which agreed to the terms of the troika , including the reforms it implied and the bailout . 
  in fact , the parties in our government pretty much said , during the campaign , they would do anything possible to make sure portugal adheres and is successful in accomplishing the goals we have agreed with the troika , and they did get elected . 
  personally , i just see merkel and the germans as being stuborn and applying stupid historic analogies when it comes to letting the ecb help solve the euro crisis as i feel the ecb could actually help europe a lot . 
  not sure how many portuguese actually agree with me on this . 
  maybe , the huge trade imbalance would have never happened without the euro as we would simply be unable to afford so many german cars and other expensive imported stuff . 
  on the other hand it was good for most people , while it lasted , because we ** could ** afford the stuff . 
  we would also be able to try to remain competitive by lowering our coin . 
  however , joining the euro also had some very good consequences like , we finally started being a lot less corrupt and we actually made a serious try at making the transition to higher wage jobs industries instead of being a low wage manufacturer like china . 
  this crisis has really just hit us in a very bad time where we had n't finished none of our goals yet and were seriously unprepared in financial terms . 
  the root cause is complicated , firstly in 1995 our balance of payments was * balanced * but it has ever since and specially since we entered the euro gone seriously negative ( huge trade imbalances ) , secondly our governments , specially the last one , have continuously spent more than they were raking in and thirdly we have a competitiveness problem where we can no longer compete with places like china in the traditional industries and have n't yet completely made the transition to be able to compete with the other places in the more developed ones . 
  there are probably a lot more little reasons i 'm forgetting , in portugal , you do n't really have a big reason like a huge banking crisis ( ireland ) or a huge tax evasion/corruption like greece , that you can point out and say `` there 's the culprit '' although , of course , we had our share of a lot smaller versions of both these reasons that you can add to the above list . 
  we are implementing very hard austerity measures ( more than the troika asked ) so , naturally , our economy will contract . 
  this will obviously damage our debt to gdp ratio but we do n't really have an alternative . 
  this does n't matter much . 
  we had already been declared junk by the other rating agencies . 
  fitch just arrived late to the party and the journalists decided to do the exact same news cycle they already did . 
  greece is quite an extreme case where the cure seems to be , in my opinion , killing the patient . 
  the incentives to perform well are there when you can see a future where , if you make sacrifices now , then you will be well . 
  the greeks probably think they are fubar anyway so fuck it . 
  no what they 're asking for is for europe to avoid economic collapse . 
  you can control the * profligacy * by using the article suggestion of '' making sure that its support was at a sufficiently punitive interest rate '' and by taking the stability and growth pact seriously . 
  what about the scottish !, 
  if you 're in the mood to satisfy my curiosity . 
  why do n't you feel close to slovenians too ? 
  i do n't really see how the euro and the ecb , as they are designed right now could have protected us from the crisis . 
  in fact the euro pretty much creates a situation like china and the us where the trade imbalances grow because the chinese do n't let their coin appreciate vs the dollar . 
  the convergence criteria was bullshitted by almost all the nations , not just greece , although they were clearly the worse offenders and germany was the first to disrespect the budget deficit establishing a precedent . 
  goldman did n't default btw .
