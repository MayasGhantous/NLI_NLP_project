  yeah that would have happened anyway , i thought you were speaking about what is happening in europe right now given the subreddit we 're in . 
   make no mistake : the current economic crisis would have happened with or without the eurozone . 
  no it would n't . 
  the trade imbalances and cheap credit that ruined the periphery nations would never have happened without the euro , the speculation that is ruining spain and italy interest rates would never happen with a proper central bank ( as the uk pretty much proves ) . 
  furthermore all troubled nations would be able to solve their problems by inflating instead of going into austerity and deflation which is totally fucking their economies . 
  ahahah as if spain politicians could regulate the international markets that lend to them, 
  how does ** that ** come from this sequence of ideas ? 
  that is a total non-sequitur . 
  of course you have instincts and feelings but you also have a huge ( in animal terms ) frontal lobe that allows you to evaluate which instincts , that you possess due to evolution , are still justified and useful today . 
  the instinct for small minded tribalism and fearing the other tribe is clearly harmful nowadays , the instinct for altruism is clearly still a good thing . 
  you can either wait a few million years for evolution to fix that ( if it ever does ) or you can use your big brain , right now , to make the whole world your tribe and be a nice person . 
  if you really need to partake in stupid tribalism channel it into something harmless like football - do n't channel it into geopolitics . 
  that 's pretty much all we 're saying . 
   germans ** suffer ** from a lack of patriotism so being rational is now a medical condition or something ? 
  of course , you have to care a little more about the people in your region because , well , you live there and probably want to keep doing so because you like the shared culture , but patriotism is pretty idiotic . 
  if you and the others ca n't see what 's wrong with the expression then i have very little hope for europe . 
  this has nothing to do with being ungrateful . 
  i never insulted anyone i 've ever helped in my life , i really do n't understand this . 
  you think the crisis is only caused by us ? 
  you think the ecb policies being tailor made for your country , not ours , does n't matter ? 
  you think the global conjecture does n't matter ? 
  to me this acronym being considered acceptable says many europeans are simpletons who rather live in a simple world where they can put the blame solely on the barbarians ( foreigners ) and feel good about themselves . 
  the nazi analogy made [ before ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/mc7d1/angela_merkel_europe_could_be_in_worst_hour_since/c2zt4pn ) was wrong in my opinion , but you can certainly see how this has a striking resemblance with blaming the jews for all the problems and recall the horrible consequences of that attitude . 
  functional illiteracy is quite poorly defined , but yeah we had some catching up to do in terms of education after our 1974 revolution ( we were a dictatorship ) , so the data for portugal is seriously skewed by an older generation which had very little education . 
  we will eventually catch up in terms of statistics but it will take time since only recently ( a little over 10 years ) has our education system became on par with the rest of the developed world . 
  please explain . 
  is this some stereotype i do n't know about ? 
  why not giips ? 
  it 's in the alphabetical ordering instead of an order clearly chosen with ill intentions . 
  i do n't really see how piigs is fitting . 
  lol relieving ? 
  if the other countries were better than they are we would n't be having so many problems . 
  i wish everyone was better . 
  everyone doing austerity at the same time seriously sucks . 
  this ranking should clearly be taken with a grain of salt anyway as it has some very odd members ( sweden # 10 wtf ) . 
  the same `` experts '' that have been advising the ecb during this crisis no doubt . 
  in a sense their design really is centuries old since they all have very old portuguese seals and coats of arms as the main components of their designs . 
  i think our [ 5 cents ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yxu5g.jpg ) is quite pretty and really makes me feel as if i 've gone back to the middle ages . 
  lol . 
  however i would n't find this one offensive as it follows the usual logic of alphabetic ordering . 
  it seems normal to me that people wish to punish the people most ( recently ) responsible for our problems by removing them from a leadership position . 
  anyway i hate this stupid piigs acronym and that its use is considered acceptable . 
  everyone in the area loses a few hours of life expectancy ? 
  how `` wise '' are they ? 
  we have no alternative but to monetize debts , how else are we going to pay the trillions owed ( italy ) ? 
  that will cause inflation and devalue the euro ? 
  so what ? 
  most of europe is already in deflation because of all the austerity . 
  both the inflation and the devaluation are quite welcome . 
  while usually i 'm quite the liberal/free market in economic terms in this situation i tend to agree with you . 
  however whilst the ecb is in shackles i do n't really see any solution for europe . 
  apparently germany and a few others seem to want everyone else in deflation like if that would help . 
   he said he had started talks to secure opposition support in parliament which would make the vote unnecessary . 
  seriously , papandreou is either a psychopath or he has the biggest political balls ever , to be able to gamble with the entire greek future like this and win . 
  i do n't know if i should admire him or fear him . 
  about damn fucking time and they should lower it even more in my opinion . 
  i do n't really see how war and destruction would come to europe as a result of a greek default/leaving the euro . 
  if you provide a rationale for that i 'd love it . 
  oh i agree that islam is a religion with a lot more baggage than the other ones , particularly in terms of politics and government . 
  true he did meet him in an apparition kinda like muhammad flew in a horse to meet gabriel . 
  i was thinking in terms of actually meeting him in real life . 
  i was just trying , by mirroring your opinions into your own faith , to make my point that calling islam an `` excuse of a religion '' is pretty random since you can say that about all of them . 
  btw paul like all other writers of the new testament did n't even knew jesus . 
  you should know paul ( the one from the new testament ) disagrees with you both on homosexuality and woman in power . 
  there 's a reason he was included . 
  either way you 're right that islam being inherently more literalist is a serious problem . 
  well christianity targets pretty much all of them as idolaters , i could give you plenty of bible passages for that . 
   the problem is how we deal with this excuse of a religion called islam you ca n't really say this since there 's no objective way to distinguish a real religion from an `` excuse of a religion '' . 
  nope , they use [ hfcs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-fructose_corn_syrup ) ( high fructose corn syrup ) which is a pretty horrible and unhealthy sweetener . 
  the reason is that corn has so many subsidies in the usa it is really cheap ( free markets lol ) . 
  i think you might have misunderstood me . 
  what i meant is that soldiers that participate in wars consistently develop serious mental problems . 
  for instance , when i was a young boy we had a lot of crazy guys that pretty much were veterans from the [ portuguese colonial war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war ) ( in the end our army was close to 217k men and between 800k and 1m men were there , a very significant percentage of our population at the time ) . 
  the usa routinely sends hundreds of thousands of each generation to fight wars so it 's not surprising at all ( to me ) that they have so many crazy people . 
  so , in a way , yes i am correlating . 
  specifically if that foreign policy includes sending thousands to war . 
   is the insane amount of mentally ill people this is pretty much what you get in a country that is in a permanent state of war . 
  raise the retirement age to 67 in 2026 ? 
  portugal decides to ignore the rest of europe after 30 seconds eheheh, 
  i 'm all for it if my country debt gets converted to soft euros we can print , i 'd love for us to pay with those instead of these euros we have now that you have to work for \u30c4, 
   the only reason it has any effect though is because people trust s&p and moody 's etc. 
  only partially true . 
  it also has a huge effect because the ratings by these agencies are used in ecb and other european institutions rules and laws . 
  so now if the banks want to comply with the regulations they will have to compensate for the downgrade and this seriously fucks things up . 
  so you agree with me and downvote me ? 
  gypsies ! = romanians, 
   illegal immigrants from ukraine ? 
  not scared , really . 
  me neither , a few years ago portugal ( before the crisis obviously ) got tons of ukrainian immigrants , they were some of the most hard working people i 've seen and they even learned the language . 
  they did drink a lot but did n't cause more problems than our native drunks , maybe less . 
  sadly as our economy tanked and theirs started improving most of them left now : /, 
  see people keep saying that the greek bailout is really a bailout of french and german banks but apparently more industries are getting a cut . 
  i wonder if i can make a deal with some greek politician where he says portugal sold greece some shit ( for instance , new uniforms for everyone ) . 
  we wo n't really deliver or even make the stuff and then , when they get more bailout money , they pay us , at least partially , for our imaginary sell and we give the politician a small cut . 
  i think i just found an elegant solution to our and greek politicians economic woes . 
   his boat was shot by the attacker , anders breivik , but gleffe said his time in the german military had taught him how to stay calm and focused in difficult situations . 
  wow this is amazing and this guy is a badass, 
  in my country case i was thinking in terms of the state weight in the economy , as in how much of the gdp is government spending , not necessarily workers . 
  but yeah northerners should probably cut that too , except maybe for norway , they got oil , 
  worst post title ever .
