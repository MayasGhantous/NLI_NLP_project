  you should pay attention to the subject at hand . 
  we 're not discussing the austerity , but the fact that yet another criminal banker is about to wreck to the ground those same austerity efforts from the past three years . 
  back to start . 
  more like two months . 
  thanks ricardo salgado . 
  ** portugal ** * citius , the software that runs all the justice procedures in portugal , is still ~ ~ having technical glitches ~ ~ ** fubar ** , and almost all courts are frozen and trying to revert to backup paper documents . 
  justice minister says sorry , still ca n't handle the situation . 
  * the software that attributes teachers to schools is still ~ ~ having technical glitches ~ ~ ** fubar ** , and there are thousands of kids without an assigned teacher , 1 and 1/2 months after the official school kickoff . 
  education minister says sorry and a lot of really stupid stuff , still ca n't handle the situation . 
  * a woman suspected of having ebola is hospitalised in porto . 
  the day before there was another scare at the same hospital , but the patient was negative . 
  * a really dumb portuguese jihadist in syria says really dumb things on an newspaper interview . 
  * pt , the major it company in the country , just imploded as result of placing all eggs in the same basket : loaning 900 million euros ( 90 % of its money at hand ) and losing it to bes . 
  * ... which is being rescued by other national banks and troika 's money , after a huuuuuuge hole in its accounts has been found . 
  it seems more and more probable that all the efforts made by the portuguese in the last 3 years are going down this hole . 
  oh , for fucks sake ... that 's just silly . 
  well , like [ this . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/alentejo_montado02.jpg ) it 's alentejo region , in portugal . 
  it 's a reference to the fact that the portuguese , mostly the older people , like to park the car really close to their home , and go to great lengths to achieve it . 
  my parent 's have a neighbour that just wiped his front yard just to get half ( half ! ), 
  the car near the main door . 
  he could just park the car outside , there 's no roof , no protection , no lack of parking , no significant distance to justify it . 
  oh , and the car it 's 10 ~ 12 years old . 
  ** portugal ** * complaining , not doing nothing about the issue . 
  * everything that might be grilled on charcoal -- sardines , thin pork beef , peppers . 
  * beer and lupins . 
  * soccer trash talk . 
  * almo\u00e7os ajantarados -- it translates to something like dinnery lunch , a lunch with a lot of friends that stretches all the way until it becomes a dinner . 
  * be late to appointments . 
  * leave everything to the very last moment . 
  * dressing like cr7 meets chav . 
  * importing high cylinder cars from germany . 
  * emigrating and trash-talking those who stayed behind . 
  * sun , beaches and tan . 
  * pastry . 
  * high powered expressos . 
  * parking your car inside your living room if possible . 
  * national pop-rock bands with self deprecating humor . 
  * showing disappointment to national bands who sing in english . 
  * hating others ' success . 
  * olive oil , garlic , coriander . 
  * eating [ bolas de berlim ] ( http://www.mariajoaodealmeida.com/img_upload/bolaberlim.jpg ) at the beach . 
  * countless hours of tv news . 
  * countless number of soccer analysis shows . 
  * soccer related daily newspapers . 
  * complaining that spanish people do n't make an effort to understand the very similar portuguese language . 
  * to not be reasonable about things . 
  finisterra . 
  i like it . 
  has a certain ring to it . 
  two words : paulo bento . 
  ** portugal : ** * portuguese football team lost at the first qualifier in a humiliating defeat against albania . 
  everyone except the football association is asking for the coach 's head for a while now . 
  * 3 spectators ( 2 children and a woman ) died on a rally car race , while 8 are in serious condition , when one of the cars veered off the track . 
  * one administrator of bes , a bank facing bankruptcy , said in a interview that he only went to the meetings to collect money for being present and never ever gave any opinion whatsoever about what was going on . 
  the whole board acted like this , apparently . 
  * one ex-minister was sentenced to 5 years in jail , for corruption . 
  the main suspect got 15 years , which is unusual in portugal . 
  what is usual is to appeal until the lawsuit expires , and that 's exactly what is happening . 
  * an update on the national justice software went bezerk , everybody is pointing fingers . 
  * there are 12 jiahdists in syria with portuguese nationality . 
  an 18 years old girl `` ran away '' from her parents to marry his jihadist lover she met on the internet . 
  * every digital data storing device bought in portugal has now a tax upon it for `` compensating for private copies of copyrighted music/films '' . 
  oh look , there 's my home !, 
  liar . 
  you probably committed suicide by now . 
  nope . 
  it means we 're procrastinating a bit before taking a nap . 
  5 minutes . 
  30 , tops . 
  then nap . 
  we 'd just have a crotch level post placed on our side . 
  another invasion averted . 
  and a sudden decline in spanish births . 
  the `` being lazy '' bothers me when i 'm not taking a nap . 
  mild does n't imply acceptable . 
  as albinomoose said , even the carnation revolution was mild . 
  it 's just the portuguese way of doing things . 
  as always , i 'm coming too soon . 
  well , i ca n't answer for fellow greeks , but -- as a portuguese citizen -- i 'm sure that nobody in portugal is asking for free money , as we know exactly what ` free ' money means . 
  so , when you paint the whole southerners with your broad brush , it 's normal that i find it pretty offensive . 
   extract funds from that kind of shit-talk is highly offensive . 
  just follow the smell of grilled sardines or chicken piri-piri . 
  it will take you there !,

  ah , sorry , i do n't think so !, 
  i was just making a bad joke . 
  but i 'm sure i 'd love to know you and confirm you being funny . 
   cheers !, 
  i can confirm this . 
  do n't be fooled by the username . 
  if i remember correctly , these are the bodies of a father and his young daughter that have been seen by the last time jumping into the water , from the port side of the ship . 
  it 's kind of hard giving you a straight answer , as almost everyone is using triple play and the price includes tv , internet and land line ( with phone ) . 
  my provider ( meo ) has this 80 $ / month plan that includes 90 tv channels , set top box , 100mbps internet connection ( not capped ) , unlimited land line calls , and mobile phone ( this is adsl based ) . 
  zon is offering something similar , at 70 $ . 
  wow has an offer where you get 100mbps mobile internet for 40 $ / month . 
  you have to buy the router though ( 50 $ ) .
