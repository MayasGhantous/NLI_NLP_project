  there 's also satellite based internet , but i 'm unaware of the prices . 
  pretty much everyone uses adsl or optical fiber . 
  or lately , ditching it altogether for mobile based internet . 
  as for coverage , i believe pretty much the whole country is covered , save some places in the interior . 
  there is a lot of options , but this might give you an idea . 
  the portuguese case is n't one about lacking infrastructures . 
  it 's just that we have a serious problem of an ageing population , and old people do n't care about internet . 
  do n't take the infographic too seriously . 
  for a start , the dark brown represents 36 % to 100 % of households without connection . 
  that 's an huge interval , if you ask me . 
  i can tell you this ( although empirically ) : almost every household with young people on it has internet connection . 
  it 's only the older generations ( 50 years old and upwards ) that are still excluded . 
  considering that portugal has an ageing population , it 's no surprise that the numbers seem so grim . 
  here 's [ the pretty one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/flag_portugal_%281830%29.svg/800px-flag_portugal_%281830%29.svg.png ) . 
  also , the woman in red got pregnant by just standing next to putin . 
  we might have a plan here . 
  that 's a real interesting perspective . 
   it stops being funny well , he 's german after all ... 
  uk is a power-user , always going for * option b ) customize your eu membership * . 
  priorities , man !, 
  psd was the culprit of the latest political crisis ( rejected pec iv , remember ? 
  ) , and it made them reach government . 
  so no , the only one being vaporized is psd if they stick with pedro passos coelho . 
  ps wo n't change the constitution , they 've been against it since the beginning . 
  stop being so dramatic . 
  this is going to end with a new coalition emerging from elections : ps+cds . 
  mark my words . 
  my experience is based in one single extended weekend in paris , and i can say that almost everyone -- except for one very nice taxi driver -- were ( mild to very ) rude to us . 
  i was travelling with my wife and my then 3 years old kid , and totally not behaving like douchebags . 
  bad luck , maybe ? 
  do n't spend so many 'n' . 
  you 're living above your own ability !, 
  i 'd go for the later . 
  go for it . 
  as awesome the uk is , an island is an island . 
  people from the uk have the enormous advantage of english being the de facto lingua franca . 
  even if you struggle for a bit , you 'll always have english to fall back to . 
  you definitely will need a car for that . 
  not for getting to lagos ( there are trains for that ) , but to get to the very best beaches you 'll need a car . 
  they are hard to find and there 's no way you 'll get there by other means . 
  it 's well worth renting a car . 
  you can thank me later . 
  if you 're going to be in lisbon , check this thread we at / r/portugal created for our visitors : http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/1domoo/thread_com_sugest%c3%b5esideias_turisticas_para_a/ edit : if you 're going to spend time in algarve , check this comment : http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/1di1dd/podiamos_compilar_as_sugest%c3%b5es_do_nosso_sub_para/c9qxpz2 but if you ask me what you should n't miss , this would be it : costa vicentina . 
  ** best : ** weather , food . 
  ** worst : ** very incompetent elites , we wo n't be able to create better ones since it 's so easy and attractive for educated people to leave . 
  we love mourinho exactly because he 's everything the portuguese are not : self-confident and arrogant . 
  we like to project ourselves in him . 
  avoid talking to portuguese taxi drivers at all costs . 
  their never-ending opinions about everything will give you brain cancer . 
  choco frito brotherhood . 
  high quality graphic artists . 
  no need to get all worked up . 
  ~ ~ hm , i call bullshit on this . 
  not one single country says english ? 
  speaking about portugal , personal experience , i 'd say english beats french by a long margin , specially among those under 35 yo . ~ ~, 
  shots fired !, 
  ^ ^ was ^ ^ it ^ ^ russia ? 
  portuguese secrete service is [ watching you . 
  [ fear the portuguese might ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ang9dlibfri ) . 
  well , he could see us as his minions . 
  the ones who went with option a ) got fucked pretty hard by [ this guy . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/afonso_i_henriques_de_portugal.jpg ), 
  no , i can understand a word or two here and there , but i do n't get the context at all ( although it sounds very familiar ) . 
  i believe romanians can understand us a bit better than the other way around . 
  if you really want to know about the actual music scene , check our portuguese music sub : / r/somluso . 
  anyway , [ this band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooxntpjqav4 ) is the best coming out of portugal lately , in my opinion : modern fusion sound , with very portuguese-minded lyrics . 
  you 're communicating in english . 
  you 've been banned from / r/portugalcaralho . 
  and me too . 
  yep , they 're the same . 
  the spanish keep sending their * perroflautas * to lisbon . 
  i ca n't blame them , i 'd send every single * freak dos c\u00e3es * to spain if i could . 
  yes , yes you are , you dark unspanish pork shop . 
  i remember an august when ant\u00f3nio costa took charge replacing pm jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates who was on holidays . 
  he was pretty clueless back then , and that year it became an hecatomb just like this year . 
  i 'm not trying to politicise this , but some men are just not good at hands-on approach . 
  he 's better at diplomacy tough . 
  hm , nope . 
  and that 's ok , i 'd never take myself and my mere opinion as a universal unit of measurement . 
  it 's quite different , i 'm afraid . 
  i ca n't look at trump and find him to be human at all . 
  he seems like a physical manifestation of pure raw ego . 
  juncker just seems to be light hearted and willing to be funny . 
  i like him because he seems and acts like a human . 
  not a common trait on most today 's politicians : `` i 'll just stand here , smile and be innocuous so i do n't risk losing votes '' . 
  obviously , they do n't shave . 
  we are fond of the velcro effect . 
   ... and say ` lol spain ~ ~ sucks ~ ~ smells like ass . 
  i guess this would make portugal and spain officially african countries . 
  please remove the / s. 
  slap in some white and this would be alfama district , in lisbon . 
  fuck that . 
  i 'd say our shambolic justice system would have a say in a freedom scale . 
  you ca n't be really free if you do n't have justice . 
   as a trump fan i must ~ ~ say this portugal you wont be second ~ ~ learn how to use punctuation . 
  i 'd say he made democracy possible , but then he brought in oligarchy too . 
  he was complicated . 
  wonderful vowels too . 
  [ i do n't always have earthquakes , but when i do , i 've giant tsunamis and colossal fires also .
