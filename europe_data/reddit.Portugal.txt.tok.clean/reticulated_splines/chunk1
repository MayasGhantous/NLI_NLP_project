the [ crazed six fingered baker she-wolf ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/battle_of_aljubarrota#/aftermath ) we unleashed at the spaniards during one their `` invasions '' . 
   pronounced somewhat like if i 'd say `` sh '' softly so what you 're saying is that they ca n't pronounce the r 's . 
  you guys are really missing out on pork . 
  that 's because bananas are extremely easy to peel and i 've seen you heathens eat citrus with a spoon . 
  now that we have your attention , can i interest you in some towels with a nice blue diagonal stripe ? 
  been shopping at [ ikea ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/25/horsemeat-scandal-ikea-meatballs-uk ) have you ? 
  just in the north i think , but also common across the border in galicia and zamora ( spain ) . 
  you should also check [ this ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/04/12/charles_fr_ger_wilder_mann_examines_pagan_rituals_throughout_europe_photos.html ) and [ this ] ( http://www.charlesfreger.com/portfolio/wilder-mann/ ) . 
  i think it was a festival and they had guests with similar traditions from all over europe , so they probably are krampusses . 
  no , pretty much the same , [ running around in pagan masks harassing young women , drinking heavily and burning shit . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/rldqjlkdqog?t=6m5s ), 
  the [ portuguese version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/careto ) . 
  they 're common all over europe ... 
  sure , but german `` food '' though ... 
  the english have been our allies for centuries and europe just for a few decades , during which they managed to fuck us several times over . 
  we only have three categories for hair color : moreno : black or brown hair . 
  louro : blonde or , has it seems , anything with a yellow glow . 
  ruivo : red . 
  first picture is dark brown ( like mine btw ) . 
  platinum blonde like the second pic is rare , the typical blonde would [ be something like this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bmw6h ) . 
  that 's half of my family and we 're portuguese . 
  yes , but we just call it flooding . 
  actually , rainfall in november in [ lisbon is 127.6 mm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_lisbon ) while in [ dublin is 69.4 mm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin?oldformat=true#climate ) . 
   dryer lol , you 're in for a surprise ... 
  except it 's not a `` christian school '' it 's a public school . 
  do you have children ? 
  do you consider crap like this to be a good example to other kids ? 
  is this a good example to young girls about their place in society ? 
  or to boys on how women should behave ? 
  they can practice their religion at the appropriate places not in a public fucking school . 
  it 's banned because it clashes with my right to not see religious crap like hijabs . 
  then italy and greece should forcibly return them to were they came from . 
  the germans can do whatever they want in their own country . 
  i on the other hand will not tolerate this sort of change on mine . 
  what can we do when you spaniards want to buy towels every single day . 
  there are a lot visigothic names and surnames over here and also in spain . 
  how does the fact that they were wearing sport shorts and not casual shorts change anything ? 
  yes it does , in fact it 's the perfect rebut to your argument that far-right affiliation precludes serving in the police . 
  i was equating islam with the far right . 
  muslims have a history of terrorism , religious extremism , rape and misogyny . 
  perhaps they should n't be serving on the police as well . 
   thish makesh them shound short of like rushiansh do . 
  more like sean connery . 
  not lisbon, 
  as a portuguese , all these reasons are bullshit and i hate lisbon . 
  dear sir , i object strongly . 
   protect themselves from what ? 
  religion . 
   would n't have even able too . 
  they would be able to . 
  lets focus on the sheer stupidity of choosing whether to cover your hair or going to the beach . 
  it 's just fucking hair . 
  they already are . 
   i think burkinis are great and perfectly compatible with a liberal western society . 
  then you are a moron . 
   the state needs to adapt no it does n't , muslims should either adapt to western secularity or find a new home on a religious muslim country . 
  secular laws were put in place precisely for the effect they are now having in this case , curbing public religious demonstrations . 
  they are quintessential to modern europe and are non-negotiable . 
  do n't like it ? 
  pack your bags !, 
  king captain slow i, 
  then again they can [ drive faster than anyone else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19f2ypvey0 ) to the hospital . 
  actually , the native stone pines are very fire resistant . 
  lol , the swedish must be as exotic to norwegians as spaniards are to portuguese . 
  i do n't know man , last time i went to galicia all i remember is waking up back in portugal still drunk . 
  those sneaky bastards must have somehow erased my mind ... with wine !, 
  depends : * [ coastline ] ( http://forecast.io#/f/37.5409,-8.7679 ) * [ inland ] ( http://forecast.io#/f/38.0156,-7.8653 ), 
  well what a bunch of stereotypical crappy food and a not very appetisin ... wooo a sardine !!!, 
  i thought wafers were belgian . 
  hazel eyes are very common but i think green eyes are also common . 
  a lot more than the 2 % people were talking about . 
  very common over here in portugal , mostly dark green although i have light green eyes myself which means a lot of eye health problems because of the hight uv exposure . 
  as a green eyed person i must vehemently protest . 
  would the portuguese erdogan be catholic , drink wine , eat a lot of pork [ and play the accordion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hla3avlz5xo ) ? 
  fun fact , in portugal wrenches are called '' [ chave inglesa ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/pt/chave_inglesa ) '' which means `` english key '', 
  complimenting the germans ?? 
  this is highly suspicious , [ can you say squirrel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sskkmbx6qmk ) ? 
  it 's not really a stereotype , they really are humorless . 
  fun fact : germans usually do n't get sarcasm . 
  in this case it means that 23andme classified my genetic haplogroups as iberian or as you put it `` pre-indo-european '' iberian . 
   also dutch cheese is better than french . 
  that was the joke . 
  or maybe we just need more to blow the debt away . 
  i think we all know who should leave europe . 
  still no . 
  [ probably the waves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgsngvatzbw ) . 
  nice try mister '' [ shits on bathroom floor ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/5zsh7m/pessoal_qual_a_situa%c3%a7%c3%a3o_de_maior_azar_que_se/df1l221/ ) '' . 
   but there was n't a lot of gyms or places you can go to do physical activity like in the west . 
  had no problem finding crossfit boxes last time i traveled to turkey . 
   it can be felt in berlin , vienna or ** lisbon ** , where each weekend , thousands take to the streets to celebrate europe . 
  no , no it ca n't , no one gives a shit , probably because we just like to spend all of ~ ~ our ~ ~ your money on wine and hookers . 
   watching kingdom of heaven ah yes ... hollywood movies , the only source of unbiased history one needs . 
  i do n't know about the rest of europe but here it is considered extremely disrespectful not removing any sort of headgear as soon you enter someones home or even when greeting someone you know on the street . 
  there is no law against it but it 's still very , very disrespectful .

  goats on the other hand are sexy as f * ck . 
  i 've been wearing t-shirts all week long ... 
  i 'm sorry , what were you saying ? 
  i do n't blame her , why ca n't you people make decent flags like us or wales . 
  so , he was right .
