   greece funny story , poseidon got drunk last friday and ... 
  change the law to jus sanguinis . 
  citizenship shoud be a privilege not a right . 
  tartessians were celts .

  that 's why you need [ jus sanguinis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) . 
  ctrl-f `` nonwhite '' ... nope crtf-f `` white '' ... still nope, 
  you 're making that up . 
  if they become french citizens then they are no longer immigrants and thus no longer applies to them . 
   this is not a realistic choice . 
  worked for hungary . 
  ffs read what you posted . 
  when in france one can be either a french citizen or an immigrant . 
   discriminated against specific groups of people that are not french or european . 
  by sending them back and not accepting any more of them ? 
  how did orb\u00e1n , wilders , trump , petry and farage create this problem ? 
   users in sweden confirmed ... actually it was just one person but unfortunately the law changed and now each comment made by a swede on reddit is registered as different person with its own , unique gender . 
   paris is not france algeria ? 
  what about those noisy f * ckng parrots ? 
  [ italic and celtic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-celtic ) are closely related so it did n't change that much . 
  is the pathological altruism that opened the border and let these scum into europe an `` european value '' ? 
  actually it 's pretty simple to argue that had europe banned immigration from muslim countries decades ago , theo van gogh would still be alive and wilders would n't even exist in its present form . 
   pvv voters should be banned from the country if they are not dutch then why not , otherwise jail . 
  btw i ca n't see your point . 
  it appears that anyone in the netherlands that criticizes islam or muslims has his life under threat and wilders , just like theo van gogh or ayaan hirsi ali correctly state this fact . 
  so unless you 're now going to argue that the islamists are right you 're just as much a hypocrite as you accused me of being . 
   death threats from islamists which proves his point entirely . 
   france and italy \u0ca5 \u0ca5, 
  ... * cough * ... [ those french over there are looking suspicious ] ( http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/04/09/thieves-make-off-with-five-tons-of-nutella-in-germany/ ) * ... cough ... *, 
   j\u00e4gerschnitzel / zigeunerschnitzel / zwiebelschnitzel / pfefferschnitzel are you having a stroke or is your cat walking on the keyboard ? 
   scary is that 74,000 romanians or 74,000 gipsies ? 
  you need to be at least one arm 's length away from the floats to enjoy it . 
  as opposed to new year 's eve , especially in cologne ... 
  he meant gipsies, 
  one of the planets will be named `` alpha croissant 3 ', 
  nice milf , would vote 10/10, 
   for pizzas , i recommend seafood hardly surprising for a guy with a tiny snake in his name , but whatever you say president gu\u00f0ni . 
  gold at long last , thank you kind leprechaun . 
  actually there are no riots . 
  the problem is that the law changed and now riots are reported separately and each person rioting is considered a separate riot . 
  from `` not happening '' to `` it 's happening , but ... '' . 
  i made my point , have a nice day . 
   not happening https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_grenade_attacks_in_sweden https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ikea_stabbing_attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_alexandra_mezher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_are_sthlm_sexual_assaults https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_social_unrest_in_sweden to name just a few and avoid linking `` biased '' news sources ... 
  what would you say is `` a lot '' ? 
  how many deaths , how many rapes of your compatriots would you trade for the safety of foreign immigrants and refugees ? 
  where is the threshold ? 
  if , let 's says , a few hundred women are raped every new years eve , would that still be acceptable in order to help thousands of refugees ? 
  i never said crime would cease to exist , but perhaps `` solve '' is n't the best word . 
   ah , well , everyone for themselves . 
  why do you care about sweden then ? 
  you do n't have anything to do with sweden afterall and could not care less . 
  that right , i do n't care if sweden or the swedish think it 's fair to trade the safety of their own citizens for this sort of pathological altruism but i certainly do n't agree to this happening in my country . 
   well , the number of crimes committed will lower but not cease to exist , like you implied . 
  1 - good enough . 
  2 - i never said that . 
   sharp increase in crime and crisis in another country that is taking these people instead . 
  could n't care less . 
  if crime is committed mostly by immigrants what do you think will happen if the number of immigrants is reduced , particularly if it 's a reduction of the most problematic groups . 
  would n't less immigrants solve the problem . 
  it 's a [ debt spiral ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5118/economics/debt-spiral-explained/ ) , the greeks do n't get any money because after a certain point it 's a recursive spiral of loans to repay previous loans and ever accumulating debt . 
  one solution is , just like the americans did after the 2008 crisis , print money . 
  especially at a time when inflation was at an all time low this should have been obvious but unfortunately germany would not have it , mostly because of trauma of similar economic policies during the 30 's and hitlers rise to power . 
  and are the criminal gangs composed of native swedes ? 
  not unless 30x of the worst third world countries have moved to sweden ... oh wait ... 
  it 's the opposite . 
  a ban on religious clothing and proselytize is what keeps the inquisitions away . 
  like i said before , stop being dense and making idiotic comparisons . 
  our own country was founded during the reconquista , a religious war that lasted hundreds of years and here you are talking about football . 
  it is more than just a piece of clothing , it 's also a message about morals , women 's status and hierarchy in society and the place of religion in the public sphere . 
  it serves as an example for all other women and i find it incompatible with western culture and will i never accept it or tolerate it . 
  now you and / u/cataphractoi can downvote away . 
  is homosexuality a religion ? 
  is there a problem with gay terrorism ? 
  keep religion private . 
  it 's not very private if you have to display it in public constantly , in fact , it 's proselytization . 
  stop being dense on purpose , you know perfectly well what a religious symbol is and why they are worn in public . 
  my freedom from religion in public . 
  but  if i go into a traditional synagogue , i 'm expected to wear a kippah . 
  then if they come to europe should n't they remove the hijab ? 
  at the very least it 's a matter of respect for the culture that welcomes them . 
  do you fucking know how many times [ i 've been mistaken for a russian ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=portuguese+sounds+russian&amp;oq=portuguese+sounds+russian ) while speaking portuguese all over europe ? 
   i agree that having to wear a hijab is a bad practice and yet you tolerate it in your own country . 
  they spoke about how much they like hijabs and that love seeing it in sweden also . 
  and a lot of wine ... 
  the original image says he 's right regardless of the photoshopped guy . 
  is n't east ukrain a ethnic russian zone ? 
  that makes no sense , would n't it be a lot easier to seize kazakstan or something like that than the rest of ukraine . 
  look who 's talking , ~ ~ mister ~ ~ herr 78 %, 
  we have a monopoly on towels . 
  that 's just because most immigrants left after the financial crisis . 
   i eat a lot of cucumbers at work there are lots of germans around here so i 've heard many terrifying stories about german food but this takes it to a whole new level . 
  how do you reinterpret `` the direct word from god '' . 
  after he retired , he changed his name to luis valencia to pursue a career as an oenologist in the douro valley vineyards . 
  no more jamon for you . 
   but we were a region of leon before the independence . 
  actually we were part of the [ kingdom of galicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_galicia ) . 
   do christians believe the bible to be the truth ? 
  yes . 
  no , [ not even the catholics believe the bible is free of error ] ( http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/is-everything-in-the-bible-true ) and anything should be taken literally . 
   i do n't consider myself a muslim but your double standards are ridiculous .
