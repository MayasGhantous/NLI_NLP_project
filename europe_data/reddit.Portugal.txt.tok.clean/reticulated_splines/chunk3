  find me one muslim , one , that publicly and literally affirms that those verses in quran are bullshit , that there are errors in it and that the quran should not be taken literally . 
  there are [ better ways ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho-fzro0sqm ) of doing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=171rmvusjm0 ) with [ picking machines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drlvha2s-js ) . 
   big difference between seeking asylum and claiming refuge as a refugee . 
  never go full retard . 
   i mean shall i not come to portugal with a young child in the fear it will get kidnapped because of what happened to madeline mccann i do n't know , considering everyone involved on that one was brit . 
  keep saying it , maybe it will come true , just like the unicorns . 
   we had the refugee crisis to deal with , terrorist attacks , but here we stand because in the end we do realise that together we are stronger than apart . 
  speak for yourself . 
  we should not have dealt with either and that is precisely why everything is falling apart . 
  or a neohippo , the worst kind of aquatic dwelling german . 
  that explains all the dutch tourists [ wandering around here ] ( http://www.darkskyalqueva.com/en/ ) in the middle of the night . 
  there are [ small one handed chainsaws ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/gj7zavv ) and most probably a 1.9 m tall ~ ~ person ~ ~ asshole like that one can lift any kind chainsaw . 
  so it 's true , germany has gone full shariah . 
  ^ ... a ^ bit ^ / s, 
   forced military conscription the horror ... 
  from the celtic or lusitanian words `` quer kuez '' meaning `` noble tree '' . 
  well , not greece and italy . 
  no , i prefer to spend my money in booze and women . 
  what laws ? 
  oh that 's easy , pizza does n't yell in the hoven . 
  although we also use that one with spaniards because of one our national spaniard slaying heroes : [ the six fingered baker woman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aljubarrota#aftermath ) . 
  that reminded me of all the hitler jokes we have around here . 
  hitler is usually accompanied by a sidekick named hans and enjoys chatting with jews at concentration camps . 
   ** hitler ** : dearr jews , tzoday i vill be letzing half you go home . 
   ** jews ** : yay !!!, 
   ** hitler ** : hans , brring zee chainsaw !, 
  yep , pc is n't one of our biggest virtues ... 
  nope , you 're just standing in front of the bus yourself in solidarity . 
  police should just switch to live ammunition , those motherfuckers did n't even check it there were people on the cars and even if they did , how uncommon would it be for a child on the back seat to try and hide at the sight of these criminals . 
  then again , considering the [ ideological background ] ( https://medusamagazine.com/beyond-pro-choice-the-solution-to-white-supremacy-is-white-abortion ) of these scum it 's not like they would mind . 
  most of the eu would not be cool with that . 
  in fact why not the opposite , people like you should leave the eu . 
  go to the me and live your multiculti life all the way . 
  are you serious ? 
  someone once gave me a bottle of the finest german wine . 
  i shall now drink it . 
  so france 's policies are determined by what a bunch of internet trolls thinks ? 
  well then , maybe it 's time for french politicians to start listening to what 4chan has to say . 
  it is in america . 
  what exactly did she do ? 
  you are neither giving your opinion on the subject nor contradicting his , just making an ad-hominem attack . 
  bring beer . 
  that sucks . 
  it maybe 40\u00ba here but it 's also raining right now . 
  i have ac ... and a swimming pool . 
  this hot weather is n't affecting me at all . 
  utter nonsense , burning trees is twice as bad . 
  not only are you releasing co2 into the atmosphere , you are also stopping the tree to absorve co2 . 
  i do n't agree . 
  countries with [ high levels of co2 emissions from forest burning like indonesia ] ( http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/10/indonesia\u2019s-fire-outbreaks-producing-more-daily-emissions-entire-us-economy ) should be heavily punished , regardless of their level of development . 
  does n't the quran actually states that muhammad had the [ heads of hundreds of jews chopped off ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_banu_qurayza ) had their women and children sold off to slavery ? 
  and was n't himmler , the de facto architect of the holocaust , a big fanboy of islam ? 
  seems like a fair comparison to me . 
  did you even read the article . 
  europeans strongly disapprove the handling of the refugee issue , start deporting migrants and those movements will fade away . 
  [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/ocvsls1ydwe?t=1m37s ) . 
  transfer them to another boat and tow that one back . 
  so what was all the oil doing before putin ? 
  ^ this ^ is ^ a ^ rhetorical ^ question, 
  [ because putin is the worst thing that has ever happened to russia ] ( http://imgur.com/a/odloq ) . 
  i ca n't agree to that and boats can be towed back . 
  seems like the best solution to me too , why would someone actually want them in europe if the majority of europeans do n't want them here . 
  no , what was agreed was to have a common policy on how to handle asylum . 
  nowhere does it mention countries should take migrants . 
   you do n't have that right . 
  well fuck the eu then . 
  no , it 's an old joke : '' * put a cream * '' -  '' * put a * '' -  '' [ * puta * ] ( https://translate.google.com/#pt/en/puta ) '' . 
  speak portuguese man , what the hell is an iftar . 
  i must know . 
  are you drunk or is this sarcasm ? 
  also , i may be drunk myself ... 
  [ where the waves not big enough ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx5_5hfv8co ) ? 
  now subtract the women , the children and the elderly from that 1.5 %,

  but are they just prejudiced against non-native species ? 
  fabulous even . 
  the trick is spend it all on [ booze and women ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/20/portugal-eurogroup-dijsselbloem-booze-women-economy-bailout-crisis.html ) . 
  it 's clearly [ legoland 's first lady ] ( https://imgur.com/a/oatuu ) . 
  let me give an example , in my country and i guess most other western countries , it is considered extremely rude not to remove any sort of head gear when entering a building or even when greeting someone on the street , and yet ... 
  yes , we should all just tremble in fear , that 's the spirit !, 
   pork needs to be prepared and cooked right . 
  2 3 days marinated . 
  uh no . 
  just do n't eat it raw . 
  i 'm downvoting you for treason . 
  what law exactly ? 
  and if syria or afghanistan or somalia actually bordered any european country some of those points would be valid . 
  if someone crosses from servia or turkey then they are no longer asylum seekers , they are illegal immigrants . 
  right ... just delete every comment mentioning `` muslim '' or `` islam '' , that will solve it . 
  or you just resent russia because of the ongoing war .

  [ history ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/crimean\u2013nogai_raids_into_east_slavic_lands ) , you should study it more . 
  so in your opinion why does this happen ? 
  rule # 1 : countries whose name starts with a `` p '' and ends with `` ortugal '' can no longer participate in the eurovision song contest . 
  that sucks , no one should go to jail for that .
