the site was hammered upon launch and it took several weeks to get it operational . 
  a major fuck-up . 
  there are so many things wrong with that statement that i do n't even know how to start refuting it ... 
  `` death to the jews ! '' does not belong to any sane freedom of expression definition . 
  the problem isnt the bank , its the non financial part of the group . 
  the bank has some exposure to that , hence the stock plunge , but it should be ok . 
  you mean , 12 champion 's league playoff quality games every weekend ? 
  oh , the horror !, 
  should have given more context ... edx is a massive open online course platform created by mit and harvard . 
  they provide free online courses that anyone in the world can sign up for . 
  moocs are known for having huge registration numbers ( in the hundreds of thousands ) , but low completion numbers ( as you can see , no country has a rate above 9 % ) . 
  to get a certification , you have to participate in tests and assignments with a grade above 50-80 % ( depending on the course ) . 
  you watch lectures , have assignments , take tests and participate in forums with other students . 
  some teachers do google hangouts to answer questions , but most do n't ( sometimes there 's a paid gersion to get a tutor ) . 
  i 've taken about a dozen courses in subjects as varied as history and computer science ( on coursera and udacity , which are very similar to edx ) , and i highly recommend it . 
  not enough ooo 's there , mate ... 
  [ wikipedia link ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/idioma_espa%c3%b1ol#pol.c3.a9mica_en_torno_a_.c2.abespa.c3.b1ol.c2.bb_o_.c2.abcastellano.c2.bb ) basically some people prefer to say `` castellano '' , because there are other spanish languages ( like gallego and catalan ) . 
  at this point though , castallano and espa\u00f1ol are interchangeable ( according to the wikipedia article ) . 
   well , i do n't see any way to filter `` consensus '' on votewatch.eu ; maybe i missed a menu options ? 
  if you can get a raw database dump , though , that would probably be an easy query to write . 
  the votes per mep are obtainable through a simple request , and it 's all in easily readable json format . 
  the list of resolutions is slightly more complicated , but nothing too hard . 
  i 'll work on it this week . 
   what else ... maybe filter for the areas where the parliament has actual power ? 
  filter by `` category '' for legislation and commissioner approval ? 
  i 've noticed each voting has `` policy area '' , `` type of vote '' , and `` procedure '' . 
  it should be enough to get some nice insights . 
   go to this page , for example , and dig around for anything that passed or lost with less than an 80 % majority ; it 's difficult , because most of the bills are things like `` resolution affirming the report of regulator x '' . 
  sounds like a good idea for a weekend project   what i 'd really like would be to get the same statistics that votewatch provides , but only for actual legislation ; that might provide more interesting results . 
  filtering all the consensus votes should do the trick , right ? 
  any other filter i should try ? 
  flag check , 1 2, 
  pensions cause unemployment . 
  that 's a new one . 
  do you even realise that pensioners are n't counted for the unemployment rate ? 
  and that those people were already pensioners ? 
  raising pensions can have really bad consequences . 
  causing the unemployment rate to rise is ** not ** one of them . 
  edit : well , that makes more sense . 
  such a minimum wage increase would surely cause problems , but i 'm sure no one would in their right mind increase it 200 % overnight . 
  `` we might fight amongst each other ... but i promise you this : we 'll burn this bitch down if you get us pissed '', 
  i would work just as hard and then spend on other shit that makes me happy . 
  different strokes for different folks , i suppose ... 
  til a house is all you need to survive, 
  a quick google search through negocios.pt ( probably the biggest portuguese business newspaper ) : * whatsapp : 41 results * ono : 4 results, 
  wtf , portugal ? 
  `` balas e bolinhos '' , really ?? 
  can we agree on split use , then ? 
  cents were irrelevant before , so i ignored it . 
  technically you 're right . 
  i 've seen both used , but before is definitely not dominant : http://www.continente.pt/stores/continente/pt-pt/public/pages/pageview/13/10/rock-in-rio-lisboa-2014/bilhetes.aspx http://www.fnac.pt/ http://www.jumbo.pt/frontoffice/contentpages/jumbonetwelcome.aspx in some areas ( e.g. 
  banking ) before is dominant , but the general public uses it after . 
  portugal 2 . 
  after 3 . 
  after 4 . 
  after, 
  i had no idea about that , and it sounds like a major improvement . 
  we desperately need a real european election , not just a way to punish local governments . 
  i remember reading that , for liquid assets , ratings trail market reactions by weeks ( not months ) , but i ca n't find the sources right now . 
  i 'll try to dig through my course notes to find that study . 
  esa has a georeturn policy that does that for every country . 
  belgium tech probably just has better lobbyists , 
  that was interesting , thanks . 
  i always assumed latency would be an issue for their main systems , but you 're probably right . 
  i can see how some intensive processes can run somewhere else and not impact their activity . 
  til ( and for the first time downvoted my own comment ), 
  so you visited a data center this big that was built by an investment bank ? 
  not financed by an investment bank , but built by one ? 
  sorry , not buying it wothout further information . 
  [ iwannaseethereceipts.gif ] ( http://papelpop.com/papelpop/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/show-me-the-receipts1.gif ) edit : also , a location in estonia would make it useless for trading . 
  maybe i 'm underestimating the needs of ib by a lot , but color me skeptic . 
  politicians announcing things when they 're just candidates . 
  why do we still believe those things ? 
  an investment bank buliding a data center ? 
  buying a data center company , sure , but investment banks are n't in the business of building things . 
  a lot of times cvs are largely the same for hundreds of applicants , making letters a useful way to triage . 
  i mean , would you prefer a triage based on photos ? 
  randomness ? 
  for jobs with few applications , letters are basically irrelevant .

  i did n't say imf was credible . 
  i just said that they did n't advise austerity based on a spreadsheet error . 
   did n't they advise austerity based on a spreadsheet error ? 
  oh , there 's plenty of cynicism in / r/portugal , 
  unemployment is known to lag gdp growth by a few quarters .

  and portugal is out of a 2,5 year recession , with a 1,1 % growth . 
  unemployment is also down . 
  i forgot how to handle good news though ... 
  seems like a no brainer . 
  there are no borders for criminals either . 
  how can you miss portugal ? 
  i think italian is the only western/central european language that does n't use portugal , everyone else does . 
  unlike algeria , morocco , and israel , which are completely non-european . 
  you 're seriously mentioned turkey as an example of non european nation ? 
  wow ... 
  do you know how would the united states do ? 
  i 'm betting similar to switzerland , but statistics sometimes disprove common sense , 
  it baffles me to see young people not being able to comunicate in english . 
  we need a lingua franca .
