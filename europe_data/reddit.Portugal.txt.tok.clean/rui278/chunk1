yay !, 
  we 're not the worst !, 
  when you sell most of your starting team , that 's what you get ... so sad :(, 
  dont blame me . 
  blame portugal . 
  benfica is love , benfica is life, 
  he does . 
  only things missing are a pint of beer , benfica jersey and coiratos ( fried pig skin , very redneck , very disgusting ), 
   but he has a mustache the true mark of the portuguese people :d, 
  i think you 're exaggerating a little bit . 
  but ok . 
   do n't take a cab  why the fuck not ? 
  they are more expensive than underground and buses , but not that much and more convenient . 
  sure , you do n't need it ( at least in lisbon ) , but it 's not like it 's a ** do n't ** . 
  it 's more of a : ** you do n't need it , but you can do it if it 's convenient to you ** ... and i have n't hear much of them tricking tourists ... 
   certain things are so ridiculous that it 's fine to just call them false for shorthand i do n't agree . 
  its just as valid as saying that your belief in its truth is so grand that you might as well just call it fact , for shorthand . 
   obviously creationism/id is completely false that 's also not the correct position , as it your statement is not a provable statement . 
  what we can , and should say , is that creationism/id are not valid science as they do not follow any scientific methodology to set their hipotesys . 
  as such they have no place what so ever in science classes . 
  but are they truth ? 
  who knows . 
  i do n't think so , as they make little sense and are unable to provide any proof of what they state , but i 'm not all mighty to just claim it wrong , because that 's just as unscientific as claiming it right . 
  i actually never though of that in that way . 
  and now i sorta agree . 
  i agree with you in the immunity part . 
  as for the will of the people , the king does not enact , propose or veto any law . 
  se his will is not the one if the people nor his own . 
  he has no will . 
  he is a puppet that serves as a representative . 
  the will of the people in the legislative branch of government is in the parliament and senate who have the real power in that matter . 
  the real power lies in the political parties . 
  not the king . 
  but hey , i 'm no expert in spain 's politics , but i would n't expect a republican like you to be impartial enough to talk about that particular subject , so i 'll just disregard your opinion and just say i do n't know and let it be like that . 
  the king represents the country , but has no power . 
  why not . 
  it 's not like it matters at all . 
  it 's merely a representative figure who has no power or influence . 
  that being said , it 's a bit of a waste of money . 
  and tha being said , i have no real opinion about the matter . 
  i was only telling u/boq that it was possible , not that it should or should n't be done . 
   when they spend too much time in the power \\  implying the king has any political power ... also , i was not implying you should have a monarchy or not . 
  just saying that you could , because it seemed boq was askingif it was possible . 
  i was saying it was . 
  not that it should or should n't . 
  i have no oppinion regarding that in particular . 
  why not ? 
  it 'd be the same as with every federal country ( like germany ) , just with a fixed president , the king ( or queen ) ... edit : i misunderstood the comment above . 
  i thought he was more talking about if it was possible to have a federal monarchy . 
  i was just saying it is . 
  not that i agree or not with it . 
  i have really no formed opinion on monarchy . 
  ofc it 's never going to be a symbol for the dictatorship ( and that 's great !, 
  it 's one of my favorite symbols overall , so it 's great that it i not generally associated with dictatorships , but instead is associated to our discoveries and air force ! ) . 
  but there 's no doubt they used it as such . 
  as for the symbols used . 
  i do n't agree with you about the party symbol being the only legitimate logo that can be associated with them . 
  but hey , opinions . 
  i honestly never say that logo before : ? 
  since estado novo never had any symbols , for me the symbols that represent it are the ones it used for propaganda . 
  the thing is those same symbols mean so much more . 
  our flag is the symbol of the republic . 
  sure it was also used by them , but it precedes them . 
  it means republic , not dictatorship . 
  the cross is the symbol of our explorers , of our one time might . 
  they were used by estado novo , but their meaning precedes them . 
  thats why we do n't associate them with estado novo . 
  but there 's no denying they were used by them and can be a symbol of it . 
  and so whey they say , here are the symbol of fascist parties , well , it is a symbol used by a fascist party ... 
  but like all the symbols in there , there is more to it . 
  the germans have long used the eagle as their standard . 
  and you can show them the nazi version , and yes , it was a symbol then . 
  but they still use it , because it 's so much more than just that . 
  but there 's no denying it was used by the nazis ... 
  but it really comes to a point where only your opinion matters . 
  there 's no right or wrong ... 
  i think it was used much less , so it 's not as comparable . 
  i 'm just saying is that it 's not that wrong to use it to symbolise the estado novo . 
  alot, 
  there 's a bot for that ? 
  awesome !, 
  so , every time i write a lot from now on you 'll answer ? 
  alot alot alot . 
  ( also , love it ! ), 
  and it was !, 
  it does not have such connotations now a days , but back in those times , the flag , the cross and the esfera armilar and the quinas were constantly being spammed as nationalistic propaganda !, 
  the estado novo did n't really create any particular symbols like the nazi did with the swastica , they just re-used our national symbols and spammed them ... 
  if you think of it there is no one symbol i 'd use to describe estado novo as they did n't really have any . 
  they did however use our national symbols alot . 
  so it 's kind of appropriate . 
  fascism includes nazism . 
  fascism is the political stance and point of view . 
  nazi-ism is the fascist interpretation of government that was created by hitler for 1932-1945 germany . 
  it does and it does n't . 
  the symbol itself does not have any connotations , but the constant use during estado novo for nationalistic reasons means it was without a doubt a symbol of the regime , but never the symbol of the regime . 
  it did however loose most of its significance since it is a very old icon with immense symbolism and good connotations throughout our history ... like most estado novo symbolism , it was borrowed from our historic symbols and as such pretty much lost its terrible connotations . 
  that and the fact that our fascism was very mild in terms of their own symbolism . 
  they mostly borrowed the symbols and flags and stuff already in use and simply spammed them everywhere with nationalistic propaganda ... 
  i think it 's on tv , but i did n't see any promos of it . 
  older people probably will still watch it because it 's on .
