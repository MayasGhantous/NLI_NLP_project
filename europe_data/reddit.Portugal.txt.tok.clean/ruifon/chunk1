yep , his first a is too low ( open ) and the last is too high ( more like a schwa ) . 
  ah , and the consonants too plosive . 
  the guy is n't portuguese .

  that 's why normal people put spaces between words instead of smashing everything together and call it a word . 
  please , put spaces between words . 
  maybe it 's not worth it .

  they will all leave to germany . 
  wonder why germany wants to take them all and then `` filter '' . 
  they do n't have . 
  taxes are too high , everything is burocratic and expensive . 
  managers and owners like to take their great part of the cake too . 
  fuck those old people voting in the same bastards over and over . 
  no one is going to stay to pay their retirements . 
  are you people eating with a spoon ? 
  wow , is [ portugal doing something right ] ( http://s14.postimg.org/w2kmzbnwx/83445_tp_ei_db_images.jpg ) this time ? 
  everyone . 
  we 're a fucking shit rectangle . 
  not . 
  we 're proud of our country and those shits , but we hear everyday in the news `` how bad portugal is economicaly '' that we forget that not everything is bad . 
  [ expensive soul - que saudade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzq3lxt3hwa ), 
  and people in the southern ( alentejo ) are lazy , and in the southern tip ( algarve ) belong to a british colony . 
  that 's an horrible highway . 
  unless you 're talking about the views or something .

  at least he made it to the bushes . 
  [ and this the second one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jhjlgbsaoo ), 
  because he really cared about the countrly , unlike others that are corrupt and only want to make money by doing favours to companies . 
  nevertheless he was a dictator , and some policies may 've hurt portugal 's development . 
  people in the northern like money . 
  we have inferiority complex towards everyone .

  it 's pretty fresh here . 
  and let everyone pay . 
  which is great . 
  gypsies ( not a nationality though ), 
  portuguese are [ the most aesthetic ] ( http://s13.postimg.org/l4qevgz0n/bmwm6.jpg ) ( because i see them everyday ) . 
  french are not bad too ( because they 're the most similar to portuguese ) . 
  hcesar is used in portugal as much as mechanical typewriters . 
  after what i told them to do , brazil would be a very different place anyway , as there would be no african slavery there . 
  without them as a workforce to explore the resources , things would have been different . 
  i do n't know how brazil would be now . 
  maybe some kind of australia . 
  leave africans in africa . 
  do n't take them to americas , nor europe , not even previously inhabited african islands . 
  i wonder how would be the world then . 
  i 'd suggest closing reddit . 
  correlation does n't imply causation . 
  in countries where poverty dropped , and also fertility rate , many other things happened at the same time . 
  you ca n't just throw money at people and expect fertility rate to drop . 
  then they 'll try to migrate to europe and we 'll have to do something about it . 
  or these : [ italian police : muslim migrants threw christians overboard ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/16/europe/italy-migrants-christians-thrown-overboard/ ) - muslims who were among migrants trying to get from libya to italy in a boat this week threw 12 fellow passengers overboard -- killing them -- because the 12 were christians . 
  yep , very good start . 
  so much potential for cultural enrichment . 
  having low birth rates just makes it worse !, 
  it makes us being even more at risk of being outnumbered . 
  i think the feeling is like when you 're in a lifeboat and everyone is despairingly trying to get in the boat , which is completely understandable , but you know you ca n't accept everyone or you 'll sink , so you will push them away even though that 's terrible . 
  europe ca n't save them all without destroying itself . 
  it might be just a prejudice of mine , but i find hard to believe we can just make up a language and it will be magically optimal . 
  how did you choose how long a certain word should be ? 
  how did you choose which sounds make certain word ? 
  what i know is that in natural languages , things evolved naturally . 
  if a common word is too complicated we eventually end up pronouncing it in a lazier way . 
  if a word has a sound that was hard to pronounce people would end up pronouncing it in a different way . 
  and that 's how our languages used to evolve . 
  the thing is that you do n't really understand what would be the consequences of what you said . 
  then what would you do to the refugees running from that city state ? 
  the only option ( in the case of accepting them ) is accepting them everywhere , until there is nowhere in the world to run . 
  and those who come are just a tiny part of those needing help . 
  we ca n't help them all here . 
  i may agree that it is easier to learn as a second language ( as a first , i believe all languages are about the same in terms of difficulty ) . 
  when i say they 're more optimized , i 'm talking in the usage , they have centuries of speakers changing it according to their preference , so i believe they tend to stay fairly optimal . 
  in fact , i 'm afraid that many things that make esperanto easier to learn , may hurt it 's optimization in terms of usage . 
  just think ... 
  when you work on the computer , there are a lot of shortcuts that help you doing things in more efficient ways . 
  but they require more learning . 
  i think this principle works in many things ... more complex things may be harder to master , but allow you to do things more efficiently . 
  would n't the price increase of that goods pose a threat to the population who do n't work in agriculture ? 
  sorry but i do n't like esperanto at all . 
  i do n't believe `` simple to learn '' is necessary a good thing . 
  what i know is that natural languages are highly optimized , they evolved like species do . 
  what about esperanto ? 
  well , it 's a constructed language . 
  i do n't like that vision because it 's too much `` north centred '' , i prefer a vision more [ geographical ] ( http://s18.postimg.org/d7uydtkfr/portugal_topographic_map_pt.png ) . 
  how is it the centre of the centre in the middle of the top half of the country ? 
  is coimbra north or centre ? 
  why do n't just use english and official language and everyone learn it as a second or third language ? 
  what are the effective humanistic solutions that do n't imply accepting them ?
