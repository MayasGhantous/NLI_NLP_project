  i think we can have a pretty good idea of the last place they came from . 
  it 's lettucies, 
  what ` sh the problema ? 
  at leasht they notish we exisht !, 
  i though it was because they ignore us . 
  we 're just that dull rectangle in the weather report 's map . 
  if someone gets frustrated by hearing a no it 's their problem . 
  we do n't reject them , they just do n't wan na come to portugal . 
  alright ?

  that 's spanish , we call * cantinas * to canteens we have [ this kind of restaurants ] ( http://s18.postimg.org/juigahrd5/851670349_3_644x461_trespasse_caf_restaurante_sn.jpg ) where you can eat [ a plate like this ] ( http://glaucialima.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/custo-de-refeicao.jpg ) plus drink for about 5 $,

  but solar wo n't make my city inhabitable and most of the people i know become ill, 
  why would n't a 873 years old and a 500 years old countries be urbanised ? 
  i ca n't even identify half of the european countries, 
  why not a spanish city instead , like badajoz ? 
  and what about that straight line in the south ? 
  lisbon and madrid are great in the last one :d, 
  we have to discuss those initial marks . 
  it shows how small the world is .

  i believe portugal is a proper word in many languages . 
  no nasals , no diphthongs , no consonant clusters , no `` nh / \u00f1 / nj/ny/gn '' digraph ... 
  it 's already perfect . 
  or no one cares to translate it . 
  i was about to complain about the * ia * ending in portugal * ia * , then i saw spain and all those * z\u00e1g * countries . 
  i believe portugal is proportionally more relevant if alone .

  so ... you 're hands are immaculate and you do n't touch anything . 
  yet , you assume everyone else has their hands with poop and will be touching everything . 
  right . 
  do you buy a drink to everyone you [ handshake after touching your genitalia ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7287/8742511821_dec9bc626a.jpg ) ? 
  it is . 
  still , would you want to touch my urine ? 
  people are fucking selfish . 
  they do n't touch the door or the tap because they 're dirty , because everyone touched them with their fucking dirty hands . 
  however they do believe their own hands are the cleanest in the world and handshaking people after touching their dick without washing their hands it 's ok . [ ** who does n't want to touch some guy 's hand after he had touched his dick ? 
  people do things like touching their face with their dirty hands , which is way worse . 
  do you wan na touch my genitalia ? 
  it 's just another part of my body . 
  stop being selfish . 
  would you handshake someone who did n't wash their hands after taking a dump ? 
  why would the door be dirty anyway ? 
  many places have taps with sensors so you do n't have to touch them . 
  and almost every place have a tap with a timer , you do n't have to touch it to close it when your hands are clean . 
  anyway , why do you assume your hands are clean even without washing , but everyone who touched the tap had their fucking hands dirty ? 
  drink my urine . 
  it 's safe . 
  what kind of bacteria ? 
  touch my dick . 
  it 's clean , you wont get any infection , so it 's ok .
