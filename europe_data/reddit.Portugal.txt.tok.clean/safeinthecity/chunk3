  and to be fair , even if they did , there 's a lot of clothes with the us or uk flag on them and i do n't really think people wear them specifically for reasons of affinity to the countries themselves . 
  also , i have n't seen a lot of yankees caps since the mid 00s , was n't aware they were still popular . 
  or maybe i just got older and people my age do n't wear caps . 
  or maybe they 're more popular in france and switzerland , who knows . 
  yeah , i do n't know about dutch pronunciation in detail ( and besides , i 'm most familiar with flemish dutch ) so sorry for derailing , just thought i 'd address the `` spanish j = portuguese r '' thing . 
  i 'd say the nasal diphthongs , [ \u00e3o ] ( https://forvo.com/word/c%c3%a3o/#pt ) , [ \u00e3e ] ( https://forvo.com/word/m%c3%a3e/#pt ) and [ \u00f5e ] ( https://forvo.com/word/p%c3%b5e/#pt ) . 
  a lot of non-natives pronounce them as `` au '' , `` ai '' and '' \u00f3i '' instead ( the sounds in english `` how '' , `` my '' and `` boy '' , respectively ) . 
  portuguese `` lh '' is different from spanish `` ll '' , though , and spanish people have trouble pronouncing `` lh '' . 
  i 'd say it 's closer to your `` gl '' . 
  i do n't think spanish j is the same as portuguese r , even though it 's often perceived as the same by us portuguese . 
  i can definitely tell when a portuguese speaker mispronounces `` mujer '' as [ portuguese spelling ] `` murrer '' . 
  like many have said here , older people tend to convert high prices to contos ( unofficial name for 1000 escudos ) , especially to convey how huge an amount of money is . 
  of course though , people 's notion of a conto is inflation-locked since 2001 ( ? ) . 
  if we 'd kept the escudo , one conto today would be worth less than the conto they have in mind . 
  oh , ok . portuguese handles long words better than english at least , i feel . 
  for instance , it seems that english speakers use a lot more abbreviations and initials than us portuguese . 
  largest we go is kilometre . 
  i guess in sweden , where distances can go into the thousands of kilometres , it might be useful to have a longer unit . 
  not really , ca n't think of a single example , neither for the country nor for the city . 
  as others mentioned for their countries though , it 's somewhat common for them to be named after `` the republic '' . 
  the table should read `` v * pronounced * as b '' , not spelled . 
  it 's common here in the north but there 's lots of people who pronounce v `` correctly '' around here too . 
  i do n't know which one is more prevalent here in porto . 
  the s and z pronounced as j thing is n't all ss and zs , it 's specifically when one word ends in s or z and the next one starts with a vowel . 
  the rest of us pronounce that as a z sound ( same as the english z sound ) . 
  the j sound , by the way , is like the french j sound . 
  edit : as for the brazil question , the `` rules '' for the pronunciation of s and z in portuguese are a bit complicated for a non native speaker , so i 'm not going to explain them in detail but s can have 4 different sounds in portuguese depending on the surrounding letters ( including the first letter of the next word ) , and z can have 3 . 
  in most brazilian accents i think there 's only two for s and one for z ( like in english ) , but the accent from rio in particular is known for doing it like in portugal . 
  i once threw up several times after eating [ alheira ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pttaai4caoc/uaxtshkj5di/aaaaaaaaapc/a1adfbwmza8/s1600/p1000827.jpg ) and i have n't been able to eat it anymore since then . 
  as i 've mentioned in a reply , i do n't like tripas \u00e0 moda do porto - tripe stew with beans typical from porto . 
  it 's a dish that 's declining in popularity anyway . 
  i 'm not much of a fan of what we call marisco , i.e. 
  shellfish and stuff like prawns and shrimp , but i will eat it if i have to . 
  ( this does n't include stuff like octopus and squid , which is usually considered fish from a culinary point of view , and which i love . ), 
  i 'm also not much of a fan of heavy meat dishes with lots of fat , but that 's usually up to whether that specific one has these characteristics or not . 
  i could love a plate of [ roj\u00f5es ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/72/ce/9e/72ce9ecc31ce3977a3a2760bc86dddfd.jpg ) but consider a different plate of roj\u00f5es inedible . 
  i used to not like most of our typical sausages and hams but they 've been growing on me since the age of about 20 . 
  i do n't like * tripas * either , similar thing but with beans , typical from porto . 
  definitely not universally liked , even here in porto . 
  yes , it 's perfectly accepted to be topless but i think it 's not as common as in spain . 
  it 's a very frequent comment you hear from people who go on holiday to spain , `` so many topless women '' . 
  ( similar to the obligatory comment on girls riding bikes wearing skirts when talking about your trip to the netherlands . ), 
  i 'd say it 's equally accepted in portugal but less women are comfortable with it ( or are comfortable with it in fewer situations ) . 
  our president is n't married because he 's a devout catholic and the catholic church does n't approve of second marriages . 
  his partner does n't seem to like the public spotlight either . 
  as far as i know , the role of `` first lady '' is institutionally official , and previous presidents ' wives certainly were more well known and were more in the public spotlight than the current one 's partner , though not as much as in the us for instance . 
  ( though not always known just for being first lady , just like hillary is n't just `` the wife of bill clinton '' . ), 
  as for the prime minister , it 's not relevant who their spouse is and it 's not a known fact . 
  tl ; dr : current president 's partner is not well known , though previous presidents ' wives were . 
  prime ministers ' spouses are n't well known . 
  paying bills and stuff like insurance , putting money into your phone for prepaid plans , buying train tickets , paying for certain services if they give you a special code , stuff like that . 
  i 'm not sure how unique this is , but in my experience atms in some other countries are more basic than that , and i 've heard portugal was a pioneer in this kind of thing . 
  like i said , there is n't an owner here ( though there is one in other places in europe ) . 
  anyway , there 's a lot of money in football . 
  how do teams over there make money ? 
  it 's probably similar here , with the big difference being that in football , players are bought and sold between clubs , which is something you do n't really have in american sports . 
  clubs are technically societies with members ( so-called `` associates '' ) here , not businesses . 
  they have an elected president and typically anyone can be an associate as long as they pay a regular fee . 
  some parents even make their children associates as soon as they 're born . 
  of course in practice it may seem more like a proper business at times , but not fully . 
  a lot of clubs have some tradition associated to them and tend to have originated from a group of people who were just interested in the sport and founded a club , not as businesses . 
  i know mostly about football ( soccer ) so maybe this comment was a bit football-centric , but here big clubs usually compete in several different sports , even if their name includes `` football '' or any other sport ( not sure how common this is in europe , i know it does n't work like that in britain for instance ) . 
  also the amount of different things you can do in them is pretty unique to portugal , i think . 
  and they 're all ( or nearly all ) part of an integrated system so all the atms from different banks look very similar and have the exact same user interface . 
  actually i see mostly french - and spanish-speaking tourists in porto as well , though i agree that other nationalities are frequent too and it 's probably more varied than outside the big cities . 
  still , these two really stand out . 
   desenvolupament that 's an interesting `` bridge '' between portuguese * desenvolvimento * and french * d\u00e9veloppement * . 
  i know , but i 'm just mirroring the spanish text and , as far as i can tell , the nuances behind noun-adjective order seems to work in the exact same way in spanish . 
  i 'm just translating the spanish * misterioso miembro * , * curioso delf\u00edn * and * terrible mosquito * respectively to * misterioso membro * , * curioso golfinho * and * terr\u00edvel mosquito * . 
  both are valid , no ? 
  i phrased it in the same way the spanish sentence was phrased . 
  pretty sure in spanish you could also say `` un mosquito terrible '' . 
  i think u/seamstress80 used that adjective order to make it closer to english , even if it might not always be the most natural . 
  ( adopta is the pre-orthographic-reform spelling that some people still use ; it 's adota with the new rules . ), 
  not at all . 
  roller hockey is somewhat popular instead . 
  we have something similar with beer . 
  there 's two main brands , super bock and sagres , and their rivalry plays into the north vs south rivalry : super bock is brewed in the outskirts of porto and sold more in the north , and sagres is brewed in the outskirts of lisbon and sold more in the south . 
  let it also be noted that barely any other beer is drunk in portugal than the standard lager from these two brands . 
  ( at least before the craft beer craze of the last couple of years . ), 
  we also tend to say maizena for corn starch in general . 
  it 's definitely not the norm here in people 's houses . 
  it 's from [ a david bowie song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrfc8c6vkta ) . 
  yes , there was the [ portuguese civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_wars ) from 1828 to 1834 , between liberals and miguelists ( absolutists ) , following the end of the napoleonic wars and the subsequent independence of brazil . 
  it was a succession war between the brothers pedro iv ( i of brazil ) and miguel , who defended , respectively , a constitutional monarchy and an absolute monarchy . 
  the liberals won , and pedro iv 's daughter , maria ii , became queen of portugal . 
  his son pedro ii became king of brazil during the war . 
  i think there was supposed to be one in lisbon a few years ago but in the end i think they did n't get permission to do it naked and ended up doing it in underwear/swimwear . 
  if you 're having the drink with your lunch or dinner , you might want it to last the whole meal . 
  there are jewish families here but they 're pretty much indistinguishable from everyone else . 
  it seems to me that older generations cared a bit more about people being jewish back in the day , but at least in my experience they 're not perceived as a different group of people at all nowadays . 
  free refills are n't much of a thing here , so people feel cheated if there 's more than an ice cube or two , because you 're getting a smaller amount of beverage than you thought you were paying for . 
  portuguese vs spanish : * coche means cart ( the ones pulled by horses ) in portuguese but car in spanish . 
  * vaso means vase in portuguese but glass in spanish . 
  * raro means rare in portuguese but strange in spanish . 
  * embara\u00e7ada means embarrassed in portuguese ( and that 's where english took that word from ) , but embarazada means pregnant in spanish . 
  * ruivo is portuguese for redheaded but rubio is spanish for blond . 
  * noivo/noiva is portuguese for either groom/bride or fianc\u00e9 / fianc\u00e9e , but novio/novia is spanish for boyfriend/girlfriend . 
  * todavia means however in portuguese but yet in spanish . 
  portuguese vs english : * l\u00e2mpada means lightbulb , not lamp .
