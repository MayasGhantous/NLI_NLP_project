  * esquisito means weird , not exquisite . 
  * preservativo means condom , not preservative . 
  * a really confusing one : puxar ( x pronounced like a ` sh ' ) means pull and not push . 
  * pudim means flan ( the sweet one ) , not pudding . 
  * marmelada is a hard quince paste typical from here ; other languages borrowed the word but use it for different types of jam . 
  here it 's `` um dois tr\u00eas macaquinho chin\u00eas '' , meaning `` one two three little chinese monkey '' . 
  and portuguese has the reverse situation , it uses `` ter '' ( = spanish `` tener '' ) as both the regular `` to have '' and the auxiliary verb . 
  we use `` smoking '' too . 
  frango is portuguese for chicken . 
  in portugal , instead of the o , it was that stereotypical italian hand thing with all your fingers together , and you hit the person with the tip of your fingers , with your hand still in that position . 
  not gon na lie , `` hercios '' sounds pretty funny . 
  do you call it hercio in the singular form too ? 
  pascal feels a bit weird in portuguese because the words ending in l get it changed to i so the proper plural is pascais which sounds a bit strange , though on second thought , some people do say it . 
  for a lot of units , the use is a bit erratic : even the same person can say newton and newtons in the same conversation and both sound equally fine . 
  yeah and there 's also the rule for words ending in l and m where they change to i and n respectively before adding the s , and some words ending in s that do n't change , and finally words that look regular when written but there 's an o sound in the middle of the word that changes . 
  but yeah , none of these special rules accommodate saying `` 2 euro '' so people do n't say it ( unless you 're bruno aleixo ) . 
  ( i 'm just writing this comment for informative reasons at this point , if anyone happens to be enjoying the portuguese plural rules talk . ), 
  kelvin are n't degrees , though . 
  it 's considered wrong at least in portuguese and english to say `` degrees kelvin '' like you say `` degrees celsius '' . 
  but my point stands , i chose kelvin because i was looking for a somewhat well known unit with a simple plural . 
  we also do n't pluralise pascal or hertz , for instance , as well as most units that are n't in such common usage . 
  yes , but they still all end in s. 
  i have n't heard paus since the escudo either . 
  same here . 
  i think in portuguese there simply are no plurals without an s at the end at all , so any plural thing not taking an s at the end sounds weird to us . 
  probably the same in spanish . 
  ( the only exception i can think of is some units of measurement named after people . 
  people will say 300 kelvin and not 300 kelvins , even though the latter is technically the correct way , and people actually say it like that for more common units : newtons , watts , joules . ), 
  i 've heard a lot of spanish people use `` pavos '' for euros among themselves . 
  also , here we used to use `` paus '' for our pre-euro currency , which sounds really similar but means sticks , so it 's the first thing i thought of when i heard pavos . 
  i wonder if there 's a common origin . 
  yeah , in my generation at least ( teenager in the mid to late 00s ) , people picked it up ( the - a version ) from american hip hop and gta san andreas , and i feel that most people just think it 's basically the same as bro/dude . 
  maybe the younger generations know a bit better due to the more mainstream exposure of us racial dynamics in the past few years . 
  typically 4 meals are considered : breakfast , lunch , * lanche * and dinner . 
  breakfast is usually part of the morning routine . 
  usually some bread or pastry based product or cereal , and coffee , milk or juice . 
  your standard continental breakfast . 
  it felt a bit weird to me the first times i heard english speakers and people from other parts of europe talk about `` cooking breakfast '' , because to me , cooking and breakfast do not go together at all . 
  lunch is typically around 13 , but it 's also common to push it back to 12 . 
  it 's just a hot meal . 
  some people have soup before the main dish . 
  it 's not as common to just eat a sandwich or some snack , like in some countries , there 's nearly always a proper lunch break and a proper meal . 
  some people have lunch in lower-end restaurants or caf\u00e9s on workdays . 
  they usually offer a rotating `` dish of the day '' for cheap . 
  it 's also common to bring leftovers from the previous day 's dinner and heat them up . 
  * lanche * is just a mid-afternoon snack , usually during a short break at work/school/uni , around 16-17 . 
  it 's not a very formal meal and it 's often eaten alone . 
  content-wise , it 's a bit like breakfast but with more savoury stuff sometimes . 
  some people skip it . 
  dinner is usually at 20-21 and it 's pretty much like lunch , except you make and eat it at home . 
  some people , especially children , also have a mid-morning snack around 10 , called * lanche da manh\u00e3 * ( morning * lanche * ) . 
  as for eating at restaurants , apart from what i mentioned about lunch , people usually have group dinners when they want to celebrate something or just have a get-together with friends or family . 
  business lunches at restaurants are also a thing . 
  to be fair , the connotation behind that word is very nuanced and specific to anglophone culture . 
  many languages just do n't have a word as loaded as that , and its implications may be hard to grasp for a non native speaker . 
  the most widespread ones are p\u00e1 , ( literally shovel , but it 's not taken to mean that , probably has a different origin ; also some people spell it pah ) and meu ( my/mine ) , but those are more like `` man '' and not so much like `` bro '' . 
  and they 're not youth slang , you 'll hear `` p\u00e1 '' from people of all ages . 
  you get mostly people in their fifties using p\u00e1 almost as a comma . 
  as for stuff like bro , the main ones i guess are mano ( short form of brother , kind of like dad is the short form of father ) and puto ( kid ) , though i feel like the latter is more popular in the south . 
  they tend to sound a lot more `` trashy '' than the ones in the first paragraph and sound a bit odd if the person saying it is over 40yo . 
  edit : since you 're asking about language and not just country , in brazil they mostly use `` cara '' , which means face . 
  pretty much the equivalent to dude . 
  like i said [ in this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6guijp/do_you_have_a_particule_for_family_names_of/ditg8w5/ ) , de/da/do , meaning of/of the , are really common and have no connotation , while e , which means and , can sound a bit posh . 
  the most upper class looking surnames are ones that preserve 19th century spelling , especially double l : vasconcellos instead of vasconcelos , or meirelles instead of meireles . 
  double l does n't exist in modern portuguese at all . 
  that 's interesting , de/da/do in portuguese surnames ( = spanish de/de la/del and french de/de la/du ) is really common and usually not even included in the short form of the name , e.g. 
  someone whose full name is ana lopes de carvalho will likely be known as ana carvalho . 
  it 's sometimes not even passed on to children . 
  there 's also `` e '' ( = and ) connecting two names , which does sound a bit posh , kind of sounds like what you 're describing for spanish `` de '' . 
  choco is a type of squid , or an animal similar to a squid but not a squid . 
  ok , checked wikipedia and it 's called cuttlefish in english . 
  yeah , outside of portugal i 've had people who were surprised that i was portuguese . 
  most commonly , people have thought i was french , for some reason . 
  i look absolutely normal in portugal , but i might not look blatantly southern european , so i guess some people just assume a rough nationality beforehand and do n't really guess correctly . 
  i 've also had someone not quite believe i was portuguese because i 'm a bit of a quiet guy . 
  google maps uses ch\u00e9quia now actually . 
  yeah , by around may i tend to already have somewhat of a `` construction worker 's tan '' , as we call it . 
  actually there was an earthquake yesterday which was supposedly felt here in porto , but i did n't feel it . 
  i 've only felt an earthquake once . 
  just felt a single up-down pulse on the ground . 
  did n't feel like anything i 'd ever experienced so i figured it would be a minor earthquake , which it turned out it was . 
  i 've slept through an earthquake or two , though . 
  yeah sorry if i did n't make that clear , i did n't mean they were competing ( though rex aired on sic and max on tvi iirc ) , just that one very obviously inspired the other . 
  ca n't really think of an equivalent . 
  when someone 's in a semi-formal situation ( eg someone talking on tv or giving a lecture ) and wants/has to use a more informal word - and here i do n't mean swearing but using words on the level of , say , `` bro '' - they might say `` passo a express\u00e3o '' ( i pass the expression ) before or after they say it . 
  and basically , whenever someone says that , what they say afterwards tends to be disappointingly tame . 
  some old fashioned men apologise to the women in the room , but that sounds a bit patronising to the younger generations . 
  here in portugal we even produced our own version , inspector max . 
  a bit different though , as it was geared towards a younger audience . 
  it actually returned a while ago , and has even appeared in adverts for dacia recently . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  some of the most popular cartoons in my generation ( i 'm 25 at the moment ) were broadcast in spanish with subtitles . 
  it 's a classic grandparent thing in portugal as well . 
  often the same people who say `` vai com deus '' ( go with god ) every time someone else announces they 're about to leave . 
  there are 7 religious holidays : good friday , easter sunday , corpus christi , assumption , all saints ' day , day of the immaculate conception and christmas day . 
  of course easter sunday always falls on a sunday so the fact that it 's a holiday does n't change much for most people i guess . 
  municipalities can have a local holiday as well , and this is usually a particular saint 's day . 
  i guess new year 's day , which is also a holiday , can be considered sort of religion-related but it 's not really religious . 
  and there 's also carnival ( aka shrove tuesday/fat tuesday/mardi gras ) , which 1 . is not actually religious and 2 . is not actually a holiday : the government decides each year whether it 's going to be a holiday ( which it pretty much always is ) . 
  for comparison , there are 5 political/historical holidays .
