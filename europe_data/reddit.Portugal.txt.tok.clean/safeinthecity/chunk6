  it 's a bit strange to me how funerals in a lot of places are a week or more after the person 's death . 
  here it 's usually 1 or 2 days later . 
  there 's a rather large network of people who can show up , it 's normal for a few friends or coworkers of close family members of the deceased to go , even if they did n't know the deceased personally . 
  seems like it 's one of the burgers called mcroyal here . 
  i think there 's the normal mcroyal and the mcroyal deluxe , which i get sometimes . 
  pretty sure there 's more mcroyals , though . 
  the `` quarter pounder '' name is n't very translatable , and i guess they did n't want to keep it untranslated . 
  ( though `` royal '' is n't a portuguese word either . ), 
  subway actually presents their sandwich sizes in metric here but it 's not catchy at all - they 're the `` 15 centimetre sandwich '' and the `` 30 centimetre sandwich '' . 
  yeah , we rarely step outside of portuguese literature , except when it 's stuff from other portuguese-speaking countries , and even that 's pretty rare . 
  not really . 
  i 'd consider your friend to be from lisbon . 
  ( i 'm not from there though . ), 
  it 's funny because amadora is itself a city and one of the top 10 most populated cities in the country but it 's seen almost as just an area of lisbon that 's not part of lisbon proper . 
  same for other suburbs in other big cities . 
  what i think is a bit different here from america ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) is that here you go from the main city to a suburban city without being able to realise that one city ended and another one began . 
  i took [ this screenshot from google maps ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kgpoj ) ( it 's about 17 km/10 .5 mi tall ) of the porto area . 
  it 's hard for an uninformed person to be able to tell what the limits of porto are in that screenshot . 
  there are actually 12 places within that screenshot that are officially cities , even though a lot of them do n't feel like cities in their own right at all . 
  chulo means pimp in portuguese . 
  fixe ( pronounced feesh ) . 
  does n't have any other meaning . 
  it 's quite hot here and i got the back of my neck sunburnt yesterday just from walking around on the street . 
  accuweather says it 's 24 degrees right now in porto . 
  black pen over here . 
  the ballot is an a4 sheet of paper with a list of parties ( parliamentary , european or local elections ) or people ( presidential elections ) with the party logo or person 's face next to the names and a square for you to cross . 
  the order is random but the same in the whole country ( or municipality , in local elections ) . 
  you can check out the party lists on sheets of paper hung outside the polling station . 
  as for the whole procedure , you go in , give the people your id card , they check that you 're on the list for that polling station , cross you out and give you the ballot ( s ) . 
  you go into a booth that 's got a pen on a string , put an x on your vote ( or just draw a dick over the whole ballot or something instead , if that 's more your style ) , fold it in 4 , go back and put it in the box , they give you your id card back , and you 're done . 
  like u/frikoz said , the use of the two dots in brazilian portuguese , french , dutch , spanish , catalan , etc , is actually completely different from their use in german or turkish . 
  might as well be considered a different symbol altogether . 
  for instance , in portuguese , the u in the word `` quente '' ( hot ) is not pronounced , it just works together with the q. 
  in the word `` frequente '' ( frequent ) , however , you do pronounce the u. 
  there 's no way to tell , you just have to know that . 
  what they do ( did ? ), 
  in brazil is spell it as `` freq\u00fcente '' , so that you would actually be able to tell . 
  same as in french words containing `` ai '' ( one single sound ) vs. `` a\u00ef '' ( an a sound , then an i sound ) , or dutch words containing `` ie '' / `` ee '' vs. `` i\u00eb '' / `` e\u00eb '' . 
  well , the 1990 standardisation thingy was only implemented in 2010 and some people and media here still use the old spellings , often out of principle . 
  and i 've heard that it 's worse in brazil . 
  ( ca n't tell if you 're actually a portuguese speaker , so sorry if you are and i 'm telling you stuff you already know . ), 
  we have letters with diacritics but we do n't consider them different letters : \u00e1 \u00e2 \u00e0 \u00e3 \u00e7 \u00e9 \u00ea \u00ed \u00f3 \u00f4 \u00f5 \u00fa . i think brazilians use \u00fc too , to mark the fact that u is not silent when that 's ambiguous . 
  before around the late 90s , i think , k , w and y were n't officially part of our alphabet though . 
   santiago wait , really ? 
  i do n't know ( and have n't even heard of ) a single portuguese santiago . 
  must be a recent trend . 
  we have a pretty prominent communist party with 6,5 % of seats in parliament and a few presidents of municipalities , and they use the hammer and sickle in their symbol ( as do other smaller communist parties ) , so you do see it quite a lot . 
  obviously it 's not illegal or anything close to that . 
  yeah , i was n't referring to italian when i mentioned that . 
  still , the only portuguese `` god '' expressions i can think of are stuff like `` for god 's sake '' and `` oh my god '' , not rude expressions . 
  i ca n't really think of anything like that in portuguese . 
  i 've always found it pretty strange how words like ` hell ' can actually be mild swear words in some languages . 
  the economic crisis is the major one i guess . 
  you often hear people talk about `` before the crisis '' . 
  yes , quite popular . 
  i even remember politicians and football people making pokemon go references once or twice . 
  i actually still play it sometimes and i know a couple of people who do as well . 
  oh right , i misunderstood you there . 
  if it 's like in portuguese , they 're not actual people 's names . 
  fulano , sicrano e beltrano in portugal . 
  i followed the science path and still had the troubadour songs . 
  well yeah , i guess the whole reason why we only eat it dried is because it 's not native to our coast . 
  you 're definitely not alone in the du/sie thing . 
  i think most european languages do it , sometimes with different boundaries between formal and informal depending on the language . 
  in portugal , all banks are part of an integrated atm system where all machines are the exact same and have the same user interface . 
  there 's only a few things where the bank matters , such as depositing cash . 
  also , you can do loads of stuff on them besides basic money operations , from paying bills to charging your mobile phone for prepaid plans to buying train tickets . 
  i think it does , `` mime '' could perfectly be a word in portuguese pronounced meem . 
  edit : wait , it actually exists , 1st and 3rd person singular present conjunctive of the verb mimar . 
  i 've never heard of such a thing . 
   sure , people might disagree with merkel 's politics in the refugee situation actually here in portugal , her refugee policy mostly made a lot of people * stop * having such a negative impression of merkel . 
  ot , not really . 
  people in general do n't really feel a connection to germany like they feel towards countries like the uk or france , but most do n't have a hostile stance on it . 
  most resentment towards germany these days comes from the german government 's attitude regarding the eurozone crisis , though the resentment is n't so intense now that portugal seems to be recovering economically and there 's more pressing issues in the eu . 
  i guess all of that is pretty much cross-generational . 
  portugal fought against germany in wwi , but we were neutral during wwii , and even declared a few days of national mourning for hitler , so there 's no real hostility from that time . 
  as far as i know , people did n't really take sides and just saw it all as a war between different powers that had nothing to do with us . 
  the population also was n't kept very well informed back then or in the post-war period - keep in mind that portugal was a fascist dictatorship until 1974 . 
  i say it the english way , and a lot of my friends do too . 
  but most people these days , especially people who were n't aware of memes until they started seeping into facebook , seem to say m\u00e9me ( so yeah , like m\u00eame in french , or mem in english spelling ) . 
  i 've heard it pronounced on the news like that too . 
  so maybe my pronunciation will one day sound like those older people that still say `` back central '' or `` gasoil '' . 
  the word meme originally comes from gene so i guess the `` m\u00e9me '' pronunciation is the natural one in portuguese . 
  the most popular game among all ages is [ sueca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sueca_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) , which apparently is only a thing in portuguese-language countries . 
  it 's played between 4 players in teams of two . 
  the whole deck ( without 8s , 9s or 10s ) is dealt in the beginning , so 10 rounds are played . 
  the team of the winning player takes the 4 cards played , and after all cards are played , the team whose pile has more points wins . 
  different cards are worth different amounts of points , with half the cards ( 2-6 ) being worth 0 . 
  a very similar game , [ bisca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bisca_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) , is also traditionally played , with the main difference being that there can be any number of players and only 3 cards are dealt to each player at a time . 
  [ burro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burro_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) is also quite typical ( though we do n't use spanish cards , like the wikipedia link says for the spanish version ) . 
  among children and teenagers , the more international [ go fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go_fish ) and [ kemps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kemps_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) ( which we call `` cames '' , pronounced in english , for some reason ) are pretty popular , but older people wo n't know them . 
  in portugal , the main competitor of the tv station that broadcast rex actually produced its own rex-inspired series , `` inspector max '' , though geared more towards children/preteens . 
  i guess internationally , the ones with the most projection are fortified wines - port and madeira . 
  otherwise , wine in general , the most distinctive probably being [ vinho verde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinho_verde ) , but also many other wines typical from different regions of portugal . 
  the font and the layout , i guess . 
  and the design style with lots of straight lines . 
  i 'm talking mostly about the 1 and 2 euro coins , by the way . 
  i like the german copper ones with the leaf . 
  also , when i get the newer ( i think ) 5 cent coins that say f\u00dcnf euro cent , i ca n't help but sing it in my head like `` five gold rings '' from that christmas song . 
  the greek owl and the ones from ireland and luxembourg are also nice .
