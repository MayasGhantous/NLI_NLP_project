  hey , you were one of the few people being really supportive so here 's an update for you  me and my partner are flying to an island in greece by the end of the month and volunteering with the doctors of the world at their clinics , helping doctors to run the operations . 
  all thanks to the people reddit put us in touch with . 
  we also have other projects lined up with this organisation as we have skills that will be useful in their projects . 
  but right now they need a lot of volunteers on the field and that 's where we come in . 
  i 'm nervous . 
  i 'm excited . 
  i 'm ready to go !, 
  we have also told the news to our families . 
  opinions are divided . 
  some family members have told us they really do n't approve of it and that we are ruining our lived . 
  my parents are cool with it and support it . 
  same for my partner 's parents . 
  thank you once again for the support !,

  oh man stop distorting my words . 
  i did n't go to nz solely to help the homeless . 
  i was working there . 
  yes and i did do volunteer work in france too . 
  yes beautiful there . 
  you should try it . 
  thank you for your comment . 
  the outpour of support messages really do speak louder . 
  all good with the peeps from / r/european . 
  i really feel sorry for them . 
  it was specially funny to see the assumptions they made of the person i am stuff like `` he must be from the south of portugal . '', 
  ( i 'm a she and from the north . 
  but how does that even matter ????? ), 
  oh well , cracking up material that is . 
  thanks again for taking the time to write something nice, 
  just because you would n't think of nz as a country that needs help . 
  it does n't mean there is n't people there that are marginalised because of mental illness , etc and that are in need of comfort and help . 
  you would be surprised at the amount of racism that exists towards the maori people . 
  thank you for your opinion . 
  as i stated somewhere else , i do n't have somewhere `` near me '' as i 'm not anywhere yet . 
  i 'm in the process of moving back to europe after living in nz for one year . 
  i can relocate anywhere and that 's part of the reason why i can go and help in greece , italy etc. 
  if after i contact some charities or ngos i find i 'm of no help , i will decide where to move to ( probably uk as i lived there for 4 years before ) and help from there . 
  thank you . 
  i have received some helpful messages stating places that need help . 
  i 'm following those up . 
  luckily i have since received many support messages that have shown me that not everyone is agains the refugees . 
  you are right in your words . 
  thank you . 
  it has been a roller coaster . 
  i have gotten some genuine helpful messages !, 
  i 'm grateful for those . 
  i will save you the trouble of reading the very unsupportive comments i am getting . 
  some other people have offered reasons on why i am being hit hard with racist comments . 
  it 's all good . 
  i am finally getting some support . 
  tomorrow an italian friend will call one of the camps and get some info for me . 
  let 's see how it progresses . 
  thank you or the tips . 
  i am not actually living in portugal but will try . 
  i 'm close to giving up on the idea . 
  i 've received so many hate messages with reasons why i should not do it . 
  as stated in my post , un only takes volunteers over 25 . 
  we are 24 & 23, 
  thank you . 
  i will . 
  i was actually an events first aider for the red cross before moving abroad . 
  they usually only use volunteers from the country that needs help , but i will check . 
  fellow european from a bankrupt country too . 
  i wish you strength my friends . 
  it 's shit when life revolves around money and all conversations lead to money relates subjects . 
  i just shared this post with my friend and he says `` life makes sense now '' . 
  thank you for making us sleep better at night . 
  fortunately i have n't lived in fear of german people . 
  if i had , this would be the end and i would make peace with them . 
  my brain imploded when i read this . 
  really !!, 
  i sent it to all my friends that were with me that day !,
