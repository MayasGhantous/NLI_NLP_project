you do n't have many upvotes , but i think that this could bring us together more than anything else . 
  i do n't like seafood either and i ate some godly meals here . 
  we have plenty of variety . 
  greece is quite safe , yes , i 'm not trying to refute that . 
  it 's just that you made it look as if greece was a lot safer than portugal in your comment , which is n't true . 
  and to avoid misunderstandings , i think greece is a great country and i 'd love to visit . 
  it really does . 
  i 'd wager that at least half would n't know where it is , and of those who would many would think we 're part of spain or something . 
  from your link : ** greece : ** * assault rate - 3.7 % * homicide rate - 1.4 homicides ** portugal : ** * assault rate - 5.66 % * homicide rate - 0.9 homicides also :  the homicide rate ( the number of murders per 100,000 inhabitants ) is a more reliable measure of a country 's safety level so how is it much safer ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if that was the case we would see two/three countries with over 90 % and the rest much lower , since they think that `` if they 're going to visit europe they 'd find more to do in france/spain/italy '' . 
  for example : if you ask me if i want to go to south korea ( as a standalone question ) i 'd say yes , for sure . 
  but , if you asked me to choose between sk and say , japan , i 'd choose japan , because i wo n't have many chances to travel to the far east . 
  the real , very simple answer is : they do n't know shit about portugal , so they do n't want to visit . 
  the number would be higher if our government had the foresight to promote tourism overseas . 
  if people do n't want to watch it in the original language then you 're not crazy , but you 're missing out a lot . 
  watching foreign movies with subtitles is fantastic for learning languages , not to mention the fact that dubs inevitably take away from the original work . 
  a good part of the actors ' performance is basically removed and grossly replaced in * most * cases . 
   maybe 'cause they never watched something dubbed in a good way . 
  can you point me to a dub where the quality is even close to the quality of the original ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i can understand italian , french and spanish better or worse , and i 've been to all of those countries , where i watched dubbed american shows . 
  so i have some authority when i say : your dubs almost invariably suck . 
  \\ thread, 
  what the hell are you talking about . 
  my grandparents can read subtitles perfectly and i never heard them complain . 
  you know , when you read subtitles since you 're a kid they do n't become a nuissance at all . 
  so that alone justifies a shitty dub that takes half of the actors perfomance away ? 
  for things you can listen to while cooking , you already have the news and those shitty afternoon shows ( you probably have them there too ) . 
   texas that explains it . 
  when you read subtitles on a daily basis since you 're a kid , believe me when i say that they 're not distracting at all . 
  you read them quickly without even noticing it . 
  i 'm sure you can find some irish and danes to share your pain . 
  great comment . 
  i would say that you have a point , but i was n't very clear in my last comment . 
  what i 'm saying is that in certain contexts saudade ca n't be translated to a single word -- that was the only point i was trying to get across . 
  you can absoluty understand the concept if you read about it ( such as in the wikipedia page ) , but i still think that what you 're saying is that you can * explain * a word in another language . 
  however , that 's different from translating in the context of say , a poem or a literary text . 
  none of the examples you provided is quite comparable . 
  it 's a bit difficult to fully explain it through here , but i encourage you to read a bit about saudade so you can get what i 'm saying . 
  edit :  being an important part of a culture does n't change the definition . 
  this correct , but the word is n't just important to us , `` saudade '' has a meaning that is a direct product of its integration with the whole portuguese national identity . 
  it 's absolutely intertwined with our centuries old culture , and some of it 's meaning is derived from it . 
   why should you ? 
  what is wrong with using two or three words , or even a sentence ? 
  that does n't make it any less translatable . 
  there you go . 
  my entire point is that in some cases , you ca n't directly translate `` saudade '' . 
  that said , i just ca n't agree with the rest of your comment . 
  comparing reddit `` culture '' to a country 's culture is beyond absurd , for obvious reasons . 
  does reddit have it 's own language ? 
  is reddit a country with centuries of history ? 
  look , you * can * translate saudade in many cases . 
  the common expression `` tenho saudades tuas '' can be translated to `` i miss you '' without losing meaning . 
  but that 's just one of it 's possible meanings . 
  the others , you ca n't translate to a single word . 
  look , if you want to know more , read the wikipedia article of it . 
  i get the feeling that we 'll end up arguing in circles here , so i wo n't say much more . 
  i will tell you this though , i 'm not `` claiming it 's different because i say so '' , saudade * is * an integral part of our culture . 
  if you do n't want to acknowledge that , then it 's no use arguing . 
  a word is much more than it 's literal meaning . 
  you just can not properly translate saudade , period . 
  yeah , maybe it will make sense to the reader , but it will never carry the same emotional weight . 
   losing cultural flavor or relevance does n't mean it loses literal meaning . 
  indeed , but in word of literature , rarely is a word only it 's literal meaning . 
  if you translate portuguese poems or books without accounting for those things you dismissed , you are not going to get the whole meaning . 
  literature and culture are n't math , so do n't stick to literal meanings so much . 
  i do n't think you understand ... saudade is n't just a word , it 's a part of out national identity . 
  prevalent in many of out poetic or artistic works , such as pessoa 's poems or the entire fado genre . 
  saudade is n't just longing , it 's actually a lot deeper . 
  edit : [ the wikipedia article describes it quite well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudade ), 
  i do n't even know anymore , i 've seen some really stupid stuff here . 
  what a balanced and informed world view !, 
  dark times for europe ... 
  \\ #rekt, 
  you 're right . 
  what i meant is that with the annexation of crimea many of these people who were somewhat `` dormant '' started to express themselves like that , contributing to the polarization many debates end up at . 
  holy crap , most comments on the guardian are downright delusional . 
   the us wants to totally ` remake ' the world in their own image and russia , ` belligerently ' , is not playing ball . 
  the uk and european countries must regain their sovereignty i just ... what ? 
   us created the whole mess by staging that coup in ukraine but of course , and obviously all the ukrainians who took part in it were paid/brain-washed by the evil evil us . 
   most importantly , this laughable piece of propaganda , in particular , is an insult to the guardian readership . 
  does the guardian really believe that anybody , but the truly brain-dead , uninformed zombies , are going to believe any of this drivel ? 
  i find this comment a bit scary . 
  the `` i 'm the one who 's right , i know the actual truth and everyone who disagrees is a zombie '' rhetoric is dangerous , and lately it has been gaining traction ... 
  these people are so blindly anti-american that literally anything a country does is good as long as it 's against american interests . 
  portugal got * a lot * better . 
  i never knew the numbers were this high as little as 12 years ago . 
  brave, 
  actually , i was n't remembering what it meant , so this post was useful . 
  besides , why would you assume that everyone here knows german ? 
  europe is huge and diverse . 
  wow , you sure are brave, 
  / u/ragnar _ ok would be a terrible mod imo . 
  some excerpts from a recent comment :  i 'd outright ban all meta posts under pain of permaban thus destroying any possibility of the users even trying to criticize the mods . 
  well done . 
   i 'd do away with / r/europemeta too so we ca n't even voice our concerns outside of / r/europe ? 
  sounds nice . 
   i 'd bring the megathread back and set automod to post it once per day and sticky , as well as set up a rule to remove every submission containing the words `` migrant '' , `` refugee '' or `` immigrant '' . 
  this is an absolutely terrible idea .
