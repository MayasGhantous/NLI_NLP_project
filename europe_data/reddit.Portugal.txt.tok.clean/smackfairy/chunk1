looking at their posting history , they just seem like a troll . 
  i would n't believe that flag . 
  wow and look at the recent poster 's usernames . 
  kinda hate that they chose `` european '' to further their racist agenda . 
  it is also the name of the whole island for anyone wondering !, 
  and it is a volcano !, 
  it is pretty high !, 
  also it is a volcano . 
  that 's amazing !, 
  i have actually never been to the top after i heard my mother 's story of going to the top . 
  basically she went with some cousins and siblings , they stayed at the top overnight to rest and the next day her legs were so screwed up they had to carry her down . 
  definitely not for everyone !, 
   pico island wow , thanks for including my birth place !, 
  haha thanks !, 
  i can read them in spanish too if there are better recipes . 
  i shall look around at different ones . 
  lem me add an azorean touch to the wonderful other portuguese submissions . 
  [ alcatra ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/9c/97/26/9c9726df8c91383510cc2164df0c43c7.jpg ) , which is a pot roast with wine , bacon , lots of garlic and onions . 
  [ recipe ] ( http://www.easyportugueserecipes.com/alcatra-de-terceira-portuguese-slow-cooker-pot-roast/ ) , it is from terceira ( not my native island ) and one of my favourite dishes . 
  it is best made in those big clay pot things but i 'm sure it 's fine any other way ( i honestly have n't tasted it not made out of those pots ) . 
  we eat them with a side of [ eddoes ] ( http://instantpot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/eddoes-steamed-under-pressure.jpg ) . 
  once they are cooked and peeled , they are sort of a grayish , yellowish white ? 
  really good . 
  i have always kinda eaten it as a meal . 
  way too heavy for a snack . 
  i can barely eat the whole thing sometimes !, 
  it 's a damn heavy `` snack '' if you ask me . 
  [ recipe . 
  ] ( http://www.easyportugueserecipes.com/porto-cheese-steak-sandwich-francesinha/ ), 
  i think they are both pretty damn awesome . 
  recipe for [ bacalhau com natas ] ( http://www.easyportugueserecipes.com/bacalhau-com-natas/ ) ( cod fish with heavy cream ) for those wondering . 
   place the duck legs in a single layer skin side down in a large pot . 
  pour the melted duck fat over top and place in the oven for 3 to 4 hours until the meat can easily be pulled from the bone . 
  welp , i 'm sold . 
  that looks pretty damn good . 
  got any good recipe or should i just google ? 
  i imagine it is n't too complicated . 
  you have to be a troll ... this ca n't be serious . 
  yeah we do but i also think we can be loud ... 
  that surprised me too !, 
  i am from the azores so i feel a little naive . 
  not bad actually . 
  it 's strange the further east the knowledge just goes downhill . 
  although , `` spain 's butt '' ... & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  yes ... yes they do ; _ ;, 
  indeed . 
  wine in the azores , particularly on my island of pico is grown around the volcanic rocks [ like this ] ( http://worldslices.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/grapes-1.jpg ) . 
  makes for a unique looking vineyard and wine . 
  i can read an understand a lot of french . 
  ca n't really carry a conversation or anything . 
  although , i did n't learn shit from the classes , it is mostly catching similar words and the latin roots . 
  i live and work in canada and when i 'm not in a portuguese/italian neighbourhood ( they tend to live side by side and intermingled ) , when someone hears me speak they almost always assume russian . 
  even myself as a cashier , i have had russians muttering at the end of my line and i had to have them come closer to see if they were speaking portuguese or russian !, 
  it is definitely that `` ch '' sound ( which my half italian boyfriend likes to make fun of ) . 
  heck yes , love me some tempura !, 
  yep !, 
  there is a [ nice list on wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_japanese_words_of_portuguese_origin ) . 
  speaking of food , [ konpeit\u014d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konpeit%c5%8d ) is a sweet treat in japan that comes from the word ` confeito ' which pretty much means ` confection ' . 
  it was a treat introduced by the portuguese . 
  yay !, 
  until they kicked us out !, 
  not before we left some words still used today as well as a bit of cuisine ideas . 
  fun fact : nagasaki was founded by the portuguese . 
  oh fuck me , that 's vile of them . 
  essentially it was `` i 'm not homophobic but why are these gays shoving their sexuality in my face ... 
  gross !! '', 
  this is wonderful !, 
  why do you think there has been such a huge shift in such a short period of time ? 
  i 'm very curious . 
  there are a few racist things in their posting history but far more homophobic hateful things . 
  he even created / r/anti _ gay it seems . 
  probably a nazi fuckhead . 
  looks like you have no idea why there are pride parades . 
  it 's not to shove their sexuality in your face , it 's to celebrate freedom and create a sense of community to keep fighting . 
  essentially , against people like yourself . 
  you say you do n't care but you really do . 
  oh man that sounds delicious . 
  yeah bolo l\u00eavedo is semi sweet and very very soft . 
  some people for some reason call it `` portuguese pancakes '' , although i find that ridiculous because they are too thick and well , you do n't eat them with syrup or whatever . 
  usually on its own or with some butter like other breads . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  is it sweet at all ? 
  it looks like the [ bolo l\u00eavedo ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/620906_479455445432757_206507789_o.jpg ) that we make in the azores . 
  and that i forgot to mention in my post oops . 
  let me add an azorean perspective to the list !, 
  our [ p\u00e3o de milho ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q8dfpy2jiny/tes3z8ueoii/aaaaaaaaazo/1bfbemm6ely/s1600/envoltas+016.jpg ) is a bit different looking . 
  it is very white . 
  [ p\u00e3o de leite ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/389643_588427131202254_654448365_n.jpg ) is a bit sweet but not too sweet . 
  if i have it at home , i ca n't stop eating it . 
  [ p\u00e3o doce ] ( http://grandmaskitchentable.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c9cee53ef0133f579daa1970b-800wi ) ( sweet bread ) , sweeter than the leite one . 
  [ bolo do pico ] ( http://silvabakery.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bolo1.jpg ) , indigenous to my island , it 's a very dense flat bread that tastes like heaven . 
  [ papo secos mothafucka ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/430026_471170386261263_1501739286_n.jpg ) fuck , how good is bread ? 
  ** edit ** : [ bolo l\u00eavedo ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/620906_479455445432757_206507789_o.jpg ) how did i forget ?? 
  it is also sweet and a bit like the leite one . 
  actually i like this much more . 
  angola was once thriving ... it 's kinda sad . 
  oh i know you !, 
  we talked about angola a while back i believe . 
  d\u00e1lia  bonus : people telling me `` did you know your name is a flower '' . 
  as someone currently living in canada , i get mistaken for russian quite a bit .
