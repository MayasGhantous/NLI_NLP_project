  especially at my old job because the area was russian-jewish ( there were also many arabs and israelites ) so if my co-workers heard me speak to another portuguese person , they thought it was russian !, 
  also because of my name , i would always be asked `` are you from israel/are you arab '' . 
  then they would tell me how my name comes from either hebrew or arabic depending on where they were from haha . 
  i sure do enjoy your food !, 
  yep ... preeeetty detached i would say . 
  feels kinda isolated , although i am currently living elsewhere . 
  this is awesome . 
  it includes my island with the volcano !, 
  i did n't realize `` ferreira '' so i 'm even worse !, 
   people ~ ~ do stupid stuff ~ ~ are stupid when they 're nazis ftfy, 
  racists shitbrains are cowards !? 
  who would have thought !, 
  i do n't think you two have the same definition of racism . 
  if it is just called not liking a ` culture ' for example , people generally are ok with it . 
  or using nicer language . 
  lol still racist but whatever . 
  that 's really lovely that she had a change of heart !, 
  in my teens , my mother accused me of being a lesbian because i had a best friend and not many other friends so obviously i 'm totally gay . 
  i love my mother but we could never really have discussions about certain issues , especially homosexuality and religion . 
  i do n't have any real feelings towards religion now ( i guess i am an apatheist ) . 
  i do consider myself bisexual ( i did not realize this until after i was 20 ) , i do lean towards men but i have had a serious relationship with a woman in the past . 
  of course , i would never ever tell her this as i 'm sure she would have a similar reaction as yours did , or even worse . 
  anyway , high five for having a mom that 's cool with being gay and i hope you are doing much better than your 15 year old self , 
  my catholic mother thinks this . 
  she thinks if men ( and women but for some reason she always spews hate towards gay men ) get a `` taste '' of it , they get `` addicted '' . 
  i 'm like , you talk about gay sex as if it 's a really luxurious , delicious treat ... 
  another a\u00e7oriano !, 
  * upvotes *, 
  this whole thread is a shitshow . 
  azorean here . 
  never heard or seen anything other than people being proud of being portuguese . 
  that 's really interesting !, 
  there is a large community of portuguese people , especially from the azores in california . 
  really !, 
  may i ask what state ? 
  that 's awesome . 
  of course , that was n't my qualm at all . 
  mine was that she did n't know portugal was a country !, 
  this is true !, 
  but she is south american so that would have been really really embarrassing for her not to know haha . 
  i live in canada , i had a friend who did n't know portugal was a country in europe ... she thought portuguese meant i was from brazil . 
  all of my what . 
  i 've heard some people make them with red kidney beans , although yeah traditionally it would be white beans !, 
  portuguese living in toronto . 
  i disagree haha . 
  driving there was a breeze because even if they are crazy , they actually mostly know how to drive . 
  i respect your opinion but also fuck you and get your cherry flavour out of my cola . 
  ^ ^ all ^ ^ in ^ ^ jest !, 
  sort of . 
  i like my u 's in words haha . 
  well yes because pepsi is satan . 
  coke forever . 
  synthetic grape and cherry tastes like medicine to me !, 
  i actually do n't mind the fake pineapple taste . 
  like candy pineapple haha . 
  i think my fave flavours are orange , strawberry , passionfruit and pineapple . 
  although i ca n't actually eat pineapple cause it hurts the shit out of my mouth . 
  pear sounds interesting !, 
  i ca n't remember drinking a soda of the flavour even though i ate the actual fruit a lot when i was little . 
  i 'm probably blind but i have n't seen it in the azores , but then i 'm from pico which is more rural . 
  looks good , though !, 
  huh i 've never seen it , where are you from may i ask ? 
  i love orange flavour . 
  in canada now , i am also so confused by the love of grape and cherry flavours . 
  i get better / more stable shit in my house in pico , azores than when i 'm in toronto , canada . 
  i feel like this a theme for us ... 
  i 'm tired of all these heterosexuals shoving their sexuality in my face . 
  i say we just ban all sexuality ~ ~ because i am not comfortable with my own ~ ~ !, 
  some conservative americans have been talking about it since it was available . 
  [ simple google search ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/health/wellness/morning-pill-spurs-abortion-controversy/story?id=9700748#.t7k6vvi3ydo ) for some idea of the controversy . 
  or what about the bill that wanted to make [ life beginning at menstration ] ( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/13/1083067/-jan-brewer-signs-life-begins-at-menstruation-bill-the-most-draconian-anti-abortion-law-so-far ) ? 
  i 'm sure there are people against it all over the globe , it 's just the us can be quite loud about it . 
  all the words i can really think of have been mentioned !, 
  anyone else sometimes get frustrated trying to find an english equivalent ?? 
  also to add a little something , this beautiful and famous song by the cape verdean ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora [ `` sodade '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eryy8gj-i0i ) ( saudade ) which i think perfectly encapsulates the tone of the word . 
  well i was born there and went to school there so i do have nationality if i am correct !, 
  i do think about moving back . 
  i remember hail falling there sometimes . 
  sounded like bullets . 
  i suppose they can exaggerate lol . 
  my mom liked her childhood though . 
  i mean they were ` poor ' but they were happy . 
  she remembers the `` rich kids '' that had shoes were seen as snobby . 
  or the first person to get a tv in town and they became the most popular person . 
  everyone going over to watch telenovelas . 
  my father is from porto actually , and he lived in angola for a long time but i have n't heard any horror stories from him . 
  that sounds pretty terrifying , what your parents went through !, 
  his stories are more about hippos , monkeys and general shenanigans . 
  i 'm actually going to ask him about it later since he was living there during exactly that time period . 
  anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you  i 'm always happy to find someone portuguese on here . 
  from portugal i mean . 
  nothing against brazil but i always run into them !, 
  yeah sorry , i meant i was born after the fall of his regime !, 
  i think it 's true , living here and comparing it to there now , it 's not much different . 
  i actually think it 's a bit healthier to live there . 
  my parents regret moving here . 
  i mean , i love toronto but it has it 's problems . 
  i still hate snow & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; when my mother was little , she went to school with no shoes and they did n't have electricity . 
  used lanterns . 
  come a long way !,
