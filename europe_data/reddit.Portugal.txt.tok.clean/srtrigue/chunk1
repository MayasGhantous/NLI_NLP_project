it would look nicer without the hats, 
  time to panic !, 
  aaaahhhhhhhh, 
  it would be more interesting to watch to , it 's usually the same 3/4 clubs that tend to do well in our league, 
  i thought you meant it less literally haha, 
  i thought the butt hole of europe was the balkans, 
  no idea, 
  ever heard of the [ fuzeta participate ] ( http://www.principadodafuzeta.com.pt/ ) ? 
  because the balkans make my head hurt, 
  that 's the autonomous region of andalusia shown in the map , obviously not what al-andalus was, 
  ask whales, 
  who ? 
  constantinople ? 
  here we go with the atlantic thing again, 
  lisbon declared independence from the rest of the country ? 
  just from the way its spelled, 
  i think `` eu anceio por ti '' would actually be the literal translation of `` i long for you '' , `` anciar '' or `` to long '' does not have the same time restrictions in its use as `` saudade '' , also , longing for something implies desire for that said something , saudade however is the memories of something long past , that you may or may not long for . 
  in portuguese the equivalent to friolero is friorento , the words seem to be quite similar in spelling ( and i imagine sound ) which is interesting, 
  turns out pirates were just speaking albanian , who knew, 
  i 've seen guns , but only at hunting/fishing stores , in a police officers holster and a hunting shotgun at my grandfathers house . 
  edit : g3 's whenever i drive past the hq of the 13th infantry regiment , there 's always someone standing guard with a g3 . 
  five times a day , facing mecca, 
  u w0t, 
  till this day i never knew i was german, 
  [ pew ] ( http://ratiganschottler.com/images/church-pew.png ), 
  explain your reasoning ? 
  what, 
  * burn the heretics *, 
   italy only known for the pope what, 
  being better than castille is not a significant accomplishment, 
  keyword is brief, 
  scotland is n't independent, 
  over here the spanish channel is just all day bullfighting , it 's channel n\u00ba 999 or something, 
   civilized, 
  i 'm almost sure it was a joke about all the navy posts lately, 
   spanish/italian/french get annoying very quickly sup, 
  do * telenovelas * count ? 
  is it available in hq ? 
  \\  the portuguese are poor . 
  they just immigrate here . 
  spain , it 's the only country that does n't border portugal which makes intermingling of cultures and history impossible, 
  his name * is * jamie usa, 
  it 's usually eua for the usa , at least in portuguese , i assume that in french it is the same, 
  king filipe iii : ^ ), 
  those soldiers probably had a bit more reason to do so though, 
  what, 
  i guess that depends on where you live right ? 
  in my area granite tops are very common , it 's almost a must have if you 're building a kitchen . 
  they 're easy to clean , look good and are not that expensive as the granite itself is mined and processed relatively close by . 
  marble however is extremely expensive . 
  granite tops are a luxury thing ? 
  where i live it just feels like a cold summer , winter will be terrible though , it 's always cold as shit here . 
  do you really need to say you 're quoting yourself ? 
  that 's a lot of russian teteeeeees, 
  they would n't do shit, 
  meanwhile mozambique cries because everyone forgot about them, 
  is your family from the azores ? 
  ( and that was n't portuguese that was mumbling ), 
  i think i understood the greek better then that portuguese they were talking , only 99 % factual, 
  i think he was referring to this specific case , not in general, 
  until recently ( maybe they still are idk ) portuguese f-16s were operating in the baltics, 
  then i 'm happy for you ( no joke ) that 's great , but maybe you should consider that there are other phtsical characteristics besides body build that are also valued . 
  are you salty because you bulked up to get girls and then found out the reason they had not interest in you was because you 're an asshole ? 
  with a comment like that you 're the one that comes of as lonely and desperate really, 
  vila real is a small city so there 's nothing that grand to show , but anyway , [ prettiest ] ( http://ncultura.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mateus1.jpg ) , [ shittiest ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fbppawzqcxw/vswsn087vki/aaaaaaaapsu/54rclqojmru/w646-h384-no/panificadora%2bvila%2breal.jpg ) edit : [ 360 view of the entrance ] ( https://www.google.pt/maps/place/casa+de+mateus/@41.2969971,-7.7127051,3a,75y,161.24h,96.79t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-ew7otk8fst8%2fvx6eease6oi%2faaaaaaaahmc%2fufxfg9o2phwfinaa5ss4j4om0gjrtq8pa!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-ew7otk8fst8%2fvx6eease6oi%2faaaaaaaahmc%2fufxfg9o2phwfinaa5ss4j4om0gjrtq8pa%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i9728!8i4864!4m5!3m4!1s0xd3ae49a89b3b831:0xa327de9e4aff107e!8m2!3d41.296944!4d-7.7125!6m1!1e1 ), 
  he 's already playing nicola sturgeon, 
  yes, 
  what 's wrong with letting children hold brooms ? 
  they do ? 
  i think you 're just building a strawman with that comment . 
  the only part of your comment that is reasonable is that young people ( even though other demographics do it to ) demonise salazar . 
  the rest is just ridiculous , who looks at those regimes you mentioned and sees them as having done no wrong ? 
  thanks !, 
  at the start it says that there are more documentaries like this about the other allied nations , are those also available online ? 
  ** yet **, 
  implying facts mater in political shit throwing, 
  same here !, 
  did n't expect the snow to stick anywhere but the mountains , it was a nice surprise, 
  being this thirsty, 
  subtle, 
  and yet when i was there in the summer it was cloudy every day :(, 
  * cries in portuguese *, 
  how many more of these are you going to post ? 
  is this a joke, 
  everything east of the border is eastern europe, 
  is this meant to be a joke, 
  / r/lewronggeneration, 
  nothing ? 
  it 's there if you bother to look at anything beyond what 's flashy, 
  our form is `` made '' for it yeah , but our skin is n't tough enough because we use shoes all our lives . 
  if you walked barefoot for long enough it would start to become tougher and more leathery , but i 'd rather just wear shoes . 
  who hurt you ? 
  i think you answered to the wrong person, 
  humans often deal with shity situations through laughter . 
  when we make jokes about it i think it makes us deal with some of the awful stuff that we do to ourselves , of course there are jokes and then there are `` jokes '' the sort of thing some people say just to be edgy and `` cool '' . 
  it 's gallows humour , and when done right i think it helps put the past behind us without forgetting how awful it was . 
  i do n't really know how such an awful thing can be made to be funny to be honest , but i think it 's just that that makes a good dark humour joke funny , it should n't be yet it is . 
  the ability to laugh at disaster might be one of our best abilities as a species i believe , it alllowd us to overcome the pain without forgetting it . 
  ( this might sound dumb idk , but it 's my opinion ), 
  it 's a joke,
