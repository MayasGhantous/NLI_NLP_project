some aftermath of the invasion , in portugal : 1 ) there were some big wave of protests by portuguese people ( and immigrants from timor ) . 
  here 's [ a photo of some protesters near the portuguese parliament ] ( http://amrtimor.org/multimedia/multimedia_foto_individual.php?foto=05358.002.120 ) . 
  2 ) some artists did [ a song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pvr5bwvciq ) to help promote the cause . 
  3 ) regarding the internet , some [ portuguese hacker crews started targeting . id sites ] ( http://www.2600.com/hackedphiles/east_timor/them.html ) ( including governmental sites ) . 
  this was fun . 
  i enjoyed it very much when i was a kid . 
  nowadays i tend to look at it as the `` goofy olympics '' , but its still the kind of competition i would like to participate at least once , because it looks fun  . 
  a related quote , from [ this source ] ( http://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/1999/1/1/b1fa68eb-294d-4e9e-b9f1-efe5712e15ba/publishable_en.pdf ) :  it had generally been expected that once we and the germans had agreed to increase the community 's ` own resources ' the admission of spain and portugal would run fairly smoothly . 
  in fact it took two european councils at dublin and at brussels to sort it out . 
  ( ... )  the negotiations seemed to be nearing a mutually satisfactory conclusion . 
  it was at this point that mr papandreou , the left-wing greek prime minister , suddenly treated us to some classical theatre . 
  ( ... )  it seems that the greeks ' appetite had been further whetted by unauthorized discussion of large sums within the commission . 
  mr papandreou 's statement threw the council into disarray . 
  everyone resented not just the fact that greece was holding us to ransom , nor even the particular tactics used , but still more the fact that , though greece had been accepted into the community precisely to entrench its restored democracy , the greeks would not now allow the community to do exactly the same for the former dictatorship of spain and portugal . 
   tsipras is of course correct . 
  there is an axis that is against syriza . 
  this is extremely worrying for democracy . 
  and this axis is ** lead ** by spain and portugal ? 
  yes , portugal is the ( new ) mean bad wolf ... 
  does anyone actually believe that portugal has any weight on this thing , to the point of being able to create any difficulty ? 
  greek sounds spanish to me . 
  we have had something like this in several [ portuguese cities ( source in portuguese ) ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/or%c3%a7amento_participativo_em_portugal ) , although i do n't think most people here know about it .

  the license to drive is not a rigth that your are given by living in a democracy . 
  voting is . 
  i misunderstood your comment . 
  my bad  . 
  the revenue is lower than expected because people are buying the reusable bags . 
  this still has a positive impact on the environment . 
  why the need to critique everything ? 
   the consumption of single-use plastic bags varies greatly in the eu . 
  in denmark and finland , only four lightweight plastic bags are used per year per person - compared to more than 460 in poland , portugal and slovakia . 
  in portugal , the law was recently ( two weeks ago ) changed in order for all the bags to have to pay a small tax . 
   a different coalition with more votes wanted to form a government instead , yet the coalition with less votes got to form a government . 
  that is what is controversial about this . 
  the problem is that this `` coalition '' does not actually exist ( yet ? ) . 
  they were still negotiating when they spoke to the government . 
  and the three of them are not negotiating at the same time ( the meetings are ps+pcp and ps+be ) . 
  is he a good teacher ? 
  from most portuguese people 's pov , calling it a coup d'etat * is * hysteria  , but i see your point . 
  i re-submitted with a different title . 
  everybody is worried about this , except ... the portuguese . 
  streets are calm . 
  football is being discussed with more emphasis than politics . 
  business as usual . 
   i make that a leftist coalition with a workable majority of 7 . 
  in theory , yes . 
  the issue is that the deadline to talk with the president ( last wednesday ) was reached and they still did not have an agreement . 
  what they have is meetings , apparently always between two of them ( ps+be , ps+cdu ) , and comments after the meetings saying they are going well . 
  the smaller parties have even declared that they do n't want governmental positions ( i.e. 
  responsibility ) . 
  inside ps ( center-left ) there are several relevant people ( example : [ francisco assis ] ( http://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2015-10-22-assis-frontal-e-absolutamente-contra-qualquer-governo-de-esquerda-1 ) ) saying they do n't want a deal with the left . 
  also , there were ( and are ) indications from both left parties , that the deal would be temporary and short term . 
  here 's an [ example from be ] ( http://observador.pt/2015/10/16/a-estrategia-do-bloco-dentro-das-regras-da-ue-so-da-um-ano/ ) where they say the deal is probably just for one year . 
  so given all this , each parties past , and the fact that they did n't have an actual agreement , its perfectly fine for the president to use his constitutional power and send the decision to the parliament . 
  of course he 's kind of betting on ps `` gaining sense '' ( from his perspective ) , or some of ps 's people breaking party line and approving the appointed government ( not very likely ; for example , the ps 's [ deputy eurico brilhante dias is against the agreement with the left , but says that voting against the party line has negative consequences ] ( http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/pais/2015-10-14-socialista-eurico-brilhante-dias-contra-governo-de-esquerda-liderado-pelo-ps ) . 
   maybe its the prez of portugal who is the guy here with the agenda . 
  he might have an agenda , but until there is an actual agreement by the three parties , i think he did the right thing . 
  ps and the two left parties need to come up to an actual agreement by the time the current government is voted . 
  finally , people on the street see this whole ordeal as a power-trip by ps 's leader , who was expected to have a much better electoral than what he had . 
  a lot of people think he 's just trying to save his ass and these people are not happy with the show . 
  thanks . 
  if he never said it like that , i stand corrected . 
  i found [ this book `` abc da pol\u00edtica portuguesa '' ] ( https://books.google.pt/books?id=2w20aaaaqbaj&amp;pg=pt61&amp;lpg=pt61&amp;dq=%22nunca+me+engano+e+raramente+tenho+duvidas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k04ybtuupp&amp;sig=867zdkqwz4ssa2qmvql-ymcy9qc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cdsq6aewbdgkahukewiywp_u8ediahvdxhqkhsobcfi#v=snippet&amp;q=nunca%20me%20engano&amp;f=false ) , where they say the actual sentence was worded differently ( `` i never have doubts and i 'm rarely wrong . '' ), 
  but the book does not say when the sentence might have been said . 
  i found a video of the [ second one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqje-6eesm4 ) . 
  i was mostly joking , but the fact that he draws a crowd does not mean that he is not a narcissist . 
   the crushing of what i call the athens spring | |  people would come to listen to me in their thousands , | | i am pretty sure varoufakis is narcissus re-incarnated . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narcissus_ ( mythology ), 
  it was just a tl ; dr for a big opinion piece that people might not have time to read and that might be misunderstood by those merely skimming it . 
  for other europeans its not necessarily obvious that the topic under discussion is the speech and not the decision . 
  i agree that the president 's speech was not good , but cavaco is cavaco ( 1 ) and he is not going to change when now that he 's approaching actual retirement  . 
  ( 1 ) proud maker of sentences like `` i 'm never wrong and i rarely have doubts '' and `` to be more honest than me , you have to be born twice . 
  twice . '', 
  edit : formatting . 
  tl ; dr : [ pacheco pereira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_pacheco_pereira ) is not against the president 's decision ( 1 ) , but against ** how ** the president reported the decision , which included personal opinions about the leftmost parties . 
  ( 1 ) * by justifying his decision to appoint passos coelho as prime minister - a decision that of itself is correct *, 
   is it really more dangerous that having a government with no parliamentary support ? 
  no it is n't . 
   antocio costa says he was an agreement , but there nothing in writing , the 3 political parties didnt even came together for a meeting , its all ear say and the president is going by the electoral programs . 
  important point that some people are choosing to omit . 
   the president stopped parties that together have a majority in parliament from forming a coalition government because he does n't like their politics - that 's deeply anti-democratic . 
  no he did n't , because they are still negotiating and do n't have an actual agreement ( yet ? ) . 
  they should have managed to pull the agreement before the deadline with the president . 
  in either case , they can fail the appointed gov. 
  in the parliament . 
  until then , they should work to finalize their agreement . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm sorry the formatting is n't great . 
   in a public vote , where people might be blamed personally and that might enter into say , party leadership debates i think it might be even more worrying . 
  i agree that these times are worrying , but they are also interesting , and i think they might make people more interested and more aware of the political situation , which is a good thing . 
  i doubt that ps deputies will go against the parties ' whip . 
  for example , [ eurico brilhante dias is against the agreement with the left ] ( http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/pais/2015-10-14-socialista-eurico-brilhante-dias-contra-governo-de-esquerda-liderado-pelo-ps ) , but [ says that voting against the party line has negative consequences ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/politica/brilhante-dias-temos-consciencia-de-que-votar-contra-o-partido-tem-consequencias_v868255 ) . 
  so either we get the ps government ( if the three parties actually come to an agreement ) or the infamous management government . 
  i just posted because your text could be interpreted as if ps only turned to the left because negotiations with the psd+pp failed . 
  ps just did n't seam much invested in a deal with psd+pp . 
  their ideas are closer to each other than ps to the left , so it * should * be easier to find an agreement if that was the purpose . 
  of course , the deal to the left allows ps to have the pm spot and a deal to the right would not . 
   negotiations with between ps and psd with no results , ps turns to the 2 left ( b.e.
