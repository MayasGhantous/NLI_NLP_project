  and pcp-pev ) this is not how it went . 
  ps did not turn to the left after the negotiations with the psd+pp failed . 
  the negotiations with `` both sides '' were happening at the same time . 
  i wrote a big ass post about it the whole situation , including some back on the political scenario and about our law , and i 'll just [ leave it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pxocz/eurozone_crosses_rubicon_as_portugals_antieuro/cwb2igm ) for those who are interested . 
  so the opposition in sweden is allowed to propose a budget ? 
  the issue is that those three parties did not manage to finalize an agreement by the time they were expected to talk with the president . 
  so the president appointed the other one and sent the decision to the parliament . 
  can the people that downvoted me give me the link for the joint statement between the three parties ? 
  thanks . 
   can propositions only be given by the ruling party or can any parliament member propose a law ? 
  all parties can propose laws . 
  he can ask another party leader to try to form government . 
  this time it would probably be costa from ps , due to being the party with the 2nd largest number of individual deputies . 
  the president can also decide to have the current government stay as a `` management government '' ( with controlled powers and controlled monthly budget ) until the new president is elected ( in february ) . 
  then the new president is going to be able to call for new elections . 
  the current president can not call for new elections because the constitution does not allow him to do this when he is in the last months of his mandate . 
  edit : added last paragraph . 
  so the three party leaders were on the news at the same time talking about how their agreement is going to work ? 
  or did the three of them make a joined statement ? 
   the president should have appointed the stable government the left proposed . 
  where can i read about this `` stable government the left proposed '' ( to the president ) ? 
  there are no ignored votes . 
  the votes were placed in different parties that displayed no interest in forming a coalition and were attacking each other . 
  in any case , those parties are in the parliament and will be proposing laws that ( hopefully ) please their voters and voting laws proposed by others in a way that ( hopefully ) also pleases their voters . 
  there 's a lot of bias here . 
  i 'm also seeing a lot of ridiculous downvotes , on perfectly decent posts written by people on both sides of the fence . 
  i find the current current political scenario very interesting , so here 's my view of the matter . 
  i will also post some links , when appropriate . 
  ** background info : ** - in portugal , the president is elected by the people . 
  he has few powers , but he has the power to appoint the pm and the power to dissolve the government . 
  - the law ( constitution ) does not define rigid criteria for the president to appoint the pm . 
  it says that the president must appoint the pm `` taking in consideration the results of the elections '' ( free translation ) . 
  - the law does not say that the pm will be the person leading the party with most of the votes . 
  - however , in portugal , which has a relatively young democracy , it has always happened that the pm invited the leader of the party ( or coalition ) that wins the election to try to form the government . 
  - this same president ( cavaco ) has appointed former pm socrates who only had a minority presence in the parliament ( in 2009 - [ 97 deputies from the 115 +1 needed to form a majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2009 ) ) . 
  ** current scenario : ** - after the [ last elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2015 ) is the following : * the party ( coalition ) with most votes ( psd+pp , center-right and right ) has 107 seats ( 102 of the coalition plus 5 from a region where psd ran alone ) . 
  they lost seats from the previous elections . 
  * the second most voted party ( ps center or center-left , it varies ) has 86 seats . 
  * then be ( `` left block '' ) has 19 seats . 
  they gained several seats . 
  * the cdu ( a coalition between the pcp - the communist party - and `` os verdes '' - the green party ) has 17 seats . 
  they gained one seat . 
  * a small party ( pan - `` people animals and nature '' ) has 1 seat and is a new party in the partialiament . 
  this vote is mostly seen as a vote outside of the `` system parties '' . 
  * there are 230 seats in the assembly , so 215 +1 are needed to have a majority in the parliament . 
  currently , no single party or pre-electoral coalition has this many votes . 
  ** also relevant : ** * ps ( ex-pm socrates ) was in charge when troika was called in 2011 . 
  * there have been some corruption suspicions about ex-pm socrates and he has been in preventive custody for the last 10 or 11 months . 
  he was in house arrest by the time of the elections . 
  * we come from 4 years of psd+pp government , in which a lot of austerity ( taxes and cuts ) was imposed . 
  their strategy was to align themselves with the eurozone main line of policy ( low deficit ) . 
  the austerity was bad and , until one year ago , nobody thought psd+pp could have a good result in the elections . 
  * the three parties of the potential `` left coalition '' are very different . 
  ps wants to control the budget and deficit to stay within european rules , while pcp and be want much more governmental spending ( i.e. 
  run a higher budget than the european `` recommendation '' ) . 
  ** back to present day : ** - after the elections , the president gave his speech , where he said that he had asked passos coelho , leader of the coalition ( psd+pp ) with more votes ( and seats ) to try to form a government . 
  he also mentioned the importance of keeping nato and eu commitments . 
  - in these elections , there was a big fight for the center vote . 
  usually this vote is split between ps and psd , and it decides elections . 
  however , ps had a bad campaign . 
  also , the main left parties managed to display that ps would still impose austerity ( they have austerity measures , like freezing retirement pensions , in their program ) . 
  - the interesting thing is that the communist party ( pcp ) leader decided to say that `` ps will only not be a a government if they do n't want to '' . 
  however , ps+cdu is not enough seats to have a majority in the parliament . 
  so an agreement would need the three left parties . 
  - so ps and pcp talked . 
  and then ps and be also talked . 
  this got everyone into a fuss because : ps and pc have an historical rivalry since after the revolution . 
  ps is pro-eu ( ps was in charge when we joined the eu ) and pcp is against eu and against nato . 
  be refused to be in the 2009 government with ps . 
  some important people in ps ( like [ franciso assis ] ( http://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2015-10-22-assis-frontal-e-absolutamente-contra-qualquer-governo-de-esquerda-1 ) and miguel beleza ) think ps should lead the opposition ) and opposed a coalition with the left parties . 
  during the elections , pcp and be were all over the place against ps and ps . 
  in one of the debates , the be leader asked the ps leader if he would agree to unite with them after the elections and he evaded the question . 
  - what these parties have in common is that they are against the psd+pp government . 
  - meanwhile , ps and psd+pp are also talking . 
  after the first meeting , they said it was not productive . 
  after the second meeting , it is said again that no compromises are being reached . 
  they blame each other . 
  * there are separate public announcements from these three parties where they say that some agreements are being made . 
  note that the announcements are not made as a group . 
  most of the agreement points are not made public , but some are . 
  for example , one of be 's flags , the cost of a legal abortion ( currently 7 euros ) is said ( by be ) to be agreed to be removed . 
  * what is also known is that be and pcp do n't want to be part of the government ( they do n't want ministries ) . 
  they are only agreeing to stay by ps side in certain key votes and not promote a `` no confidence vote '' . 
  imo , * this means that they are not taking responsibility * . 
  * there are some announcements that show that this 3-party agreement might not be stable . 
  for example , joana mort\u00e1gua from be said that they [ will only support a ps gov. 
  for 1 year unless ps decides to review the `` budged pact '' ( deficit control measures ) ] ( http://observador.pt/2015/10/16/a-estrategia-do-bloco-dentro-das-regras-da-ue-so-da-um-ano/ ) . 
  - then comes the week where the president talks with the parties and hears each of them before deciding ( this past wednesday ) . 
  at this point , there was no formal and final agreement between the three parties . 
  also , since they are not proposing a cabinet contained of people from the three parties , it can be argued that the two left parties are not willing to take responsibility . 
  - so the president gave the task to form the government to pm passos coelho ( psd+pp ) and now it will be voted in the parliament . 
  - so what the president actually did was to ** give the responsibility to the parliament ** . 
  - the problem is that he also made some nasty comments against the left parties , due to his nato and eu opinions . 
  - the government ** will probably fail in the parliament vote ** . 
  however , it is possible that some deputies from ps , that are against agreements with the left ( and maybe even the pan guy ) , may abstain in a `` vote of no confidence '' or in the budget vote . 
  - if it fails , the president will have to decide if he wants to ask ps to try to make a government or if he keeps the current government in position until the new president can be elected and new legislative elections can be held ( april or june 2016 ) . 
  tl ; dr : the problem is not what he did , which was in his constitutional rights , the problem is how he announced it . 
  his comments against left parties are a bad argument and they may serve to unite the left further . 
  right now , portuguese politics are better than the `` borgen '' tv-show .
