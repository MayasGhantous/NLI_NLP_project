  -- henry a. kissinger, 
   what would a white minority mean in the uk ? 
  we do n't even know if it 's bad . 
  i got a certain bad stereotype against people who use the earth flair , and you just further reinforced it . 
  sadly with each passing year what started as a work of fiction becomes closer to representing reality ... 
  if these migrants keep coming year after year western civilization as we know it will be lost , this is a change that is irreversible and that will completely alter europe . 
  i dunno , but maybe this kind of irrational behaviour is why their countries are terrible places to live . 
   `` do not give what is holy to dogs , and do not throw pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces . '', 
  blame turkey since they 're not honouring the un convention on refugees . 
  send them back to the first safe country they passed through on their way here , it 's their international responsibility to grant them asylum , not ours . 
   yes , are you aware that the vatican was n't the only christian entity in europe at the time ? 
  and ? 
  they tried to prevent bloodshed between christian nations , which is exactly what every christian entity should have done . 
   anticlericalism is not the same as atheism : hitler hated the catholic church and many of the protestant churches , but he did not despise christainity . 
  he 's quoted by albert speer as saying that he wished germans were muslims instead of christians :  according to speer , hitler stated in private , `` the mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than christianity . 
  why did it have to be christianity with its meekness and flabbiness ? 
   similarly , hitler was transcribed as saying : `` had charles martel not been victorious at poitiers [ ... ] then we should in all probability have been converted to mohammedanism , that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh heaven to the bold warrior alone . 
  then the germanic races would have conquered the world . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_views_of_adolf_hitler#hitler.27s_views_on_islam  make up your mind : are they `` despicable things '' or are the `` the wisdom of our ancestors '' ? 
  i do n't know of any ancestor of mine that was muslim , and my country was built on christianity , not islam . 
  well , why would we want them either ? 
   that sounds like he has totes changed his mind about self-defense , uh ? 
   if it is possible , ** as far as it depends on you ** , live at peace with everyone . 
   lol no , you are a terribly misguided catholic . 
  the very pillar of your religion , the feature that distinguishes it from other branch of christianity , is the belief that the bishops and the pope who leads them hold authority over the church by way of apostolic succession ; it 's the reason why your creed specifies that the church is `` catholic , apostolic and roman '' . 
  you are instructed to follow their leadership , to abandon yourself to gross heresy because you find it personally hard to be a faithful catholic . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about , bishops and even the pope can fall into heresy , and in that case it is the duty of every catholic to not follow them . 
   wwi was a slapfight between atheist clubs have you actually read about the role the vatican had in wwi ? 
  they did everything they could to prevent it from happening even begging european states to avoid making that mistake , when european powers to failed to heed the advise of the pope the vatican dedicated itself to fight the use of inhuman weaponry and try to bring an end to the war as soon as possible . 
   it was the very much christian nazi germany that perpetrated the most famous atrocity of the century . 
  inb4 `` nazis were all pagans because muh nazi occultism '' , lol nazi official policy was that only christians could be national socialists . 
  but it is know that hitler despised christianity and only officially endorsed it because his population was christian . 
  again , read the role catholics had in opposing the nazi regime and the encyclical by pope pius xi , written and smuggled into germany in march 1937 , criticizing nazi ideology : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mit_brennender_sorge  me , i 'll stay here with `` what sounded good '' . 
  those very things you criticize are coming to this continent . 
  if you 're wealthy you can surely insulate yourself from them , but for the poorest classes there 's no escape from seeing their neighbourhood taken over by an ideology that preaches those despicable things that you 've mentioned . 
   and this , ladies and gentlemen , is how religious fanatics twist the words of a radical pacifist to justify their violent tendencies . 
  you have christ literally telling you what to do in the most explicit language : christ was n't a radical pacifist , he advised his followers to sell their cloaks and buy a sword as they would face persecution and would have to defend themselves . 
  he preached pacifism when possible , but faced with the threat of annihilation it is the duty of a christian to defend himself and all that is holy . 
  note that the passage you 've quoted only mentions things that would n't lead to death . 
  when it comes to lethal threats christ endorsed self-defence . 
   also , are you a catholic ? 
  are you aware of what the catholic church teaches in regards to immigration ? 
  because , spoiler alert , it 's not `` keep them faithless muslims out '' . 
  i am catholic , and as such i 'm instructed to stick to tradition whenever the catholic church and pope may fall into heresy , which is the case when it comes to their position regarding these muslim migrants . 
   i 'd rather pick the third side , the one that believes we should n't structure 21st century society according to bronze age thinking . 
  funnily enough , most european christians also pick this side , which is why we fortunately live in a saecular continent rather than a christian continent . 
  when we were a christian continent our human rights record was no better than what the middle east has now . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about , human rights evolved out of christianity and the great atrocities of the 20th century in europe were perpetrated by pagan or atheistic regimes , both of which were criticized by the catholic church . 
  what you call bronze age thinking is the wisdom of our ancestors , some things have been figured out long ago and most of our recent history has centred around replacing what worked for millennia with what sounded good . 
   15 `` watch out for false prophets . 
  they come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ferocious wolves . 
  16 by their fruit you will recognize them . 
  do people pick grapes from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ? 
  17 likewise , every good tree bears good fruit , but a bad tree bears bad fruit . 
  18 a good tree can not bear bad fruit , and a bad tree can not bear good fruit . 
  19 every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . 
  20 thus , by their fruit you will recognize them . 
   do not give dogs what is sacred ; do not throw your pearls to pigs . 
  if you do , they may trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .

  if you open your heart , you also have to open your wallet . 
  well fug : - dddddd, 
  the difference being that christianity still holds much influence over western civilization whilst zeus and thor have none . 
   the simple fact of the matter is that for the vast majority of europeans support secular government . 
  and that does n't change the fact that at the foundation of western civilization you 'll find christianity . 
   call me when the spanish inquisition starts back up again . 
  that out of all the aspects of christianity you mention that shows how much disdain you have towards it . 
  maybe when you grow older you 'll learn to appreciate the teachings of jesus christ and understand the role they played in the development of our civilization . 
  western civilization is christian civilization . 
  if you ca n't pick between a side which professes a backwards religion that has threatened europe for millennia and the side which professes the faith of your ancestors upon which this continent was built then there 's something wrong with you . 
  you would n't have western civilization without christianity , it 's an integral part of it and even if the nords not longer profess the faith of their ancestors they 're still culturally christian . 
  western civilization is deeply entwined with christianity , and that 's a fact you ca n't fedora tip away . 
  there 's plenty of safe nations between europe and isis held territory . 
  oh boy , you sure told me !, 
  democracy is not the end all be all , if you could ask people in angola and mozambique , who suffered under decades of civil wars and poverty only to end up with an oligarchy disguised as a democracy , if they would rather go back to being ruled by a benevolent dictatorship , i 'm sure 99 % percent of them would say yes . 
  only portugal and cape verde enjoy a democracy , and even then our democracy built on socialist principles has done nothing but economically and socially sink the country . 
  whilst under marcello caetano we were growing at the rate of the asian tigers with barely no debt and a growing population now after nearly 50 of democracy we have a country with one of the highest debts in the world , an stagnant economy unable to provide families with the resources necessary to raise children . 
  by all means our country is languishing away under democracy whilst it grew healthily under the estado novo regime . 
  i do n't expect a response , when you do n't have any solid arguments running away from a discussion is the only way to save face . 
  the only way to solve this is to send every illegal immigrant back . 
  australia showed this to be the correct answer , so why do n't eu heads do the same ? 
  is it incompetence of do they really plan to turn europe into a multicultural continent out of ideology ? 
  the people that rule us live completely disconnected from reality . 
  there 's no better way to make a good impression than belligerently shouting allahu akbar while trying to enter a christian continent . 
   a more recent event would be the carnation revolution . 
  in 1975 , the fascist dictatorship was overthrown by our military with the support of the people . 
  actually it was in 1974 and it 's one of the darkest pages in portuguese history as that revolution led to our government abandoning the interests of half a million portuguese in africa and those of the natives , including black soldiers who fought for us and were left behind to be promptly executed and dumped in mass graves . 
  also we were already converging with the rest of europe under the estado novo regime :  in 1960 , at the initiation of salazar 's more outward-looking economic policy , portugal 's per capita gdp was only 38 percent of the european community ( ec-12 ) average ; by the end of the salazar period , in 1968 , it had risen to 48 percent ; and in 1973 , under the leadership of marcelo caetano , portugal 's per capita gdp had reached 56.4 percent of the ec-12 average . 
  on a long term analysis , after a long period of economic divergence before 1914 , and a period of chaos during the first republic , the portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950 , entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of western europe , until the carnation revolution in april 1974 . 
  ** portuguese economic growth in the period 1960 to 1973 under the estado novo regime ( and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in african territories against independence guerrilla groups ) , created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of western europe . 
  **  ** the economy of portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the carnation revolution ( a military coup on 25 april 1974 ) was growing well above the european average . 
  average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable consumer goods . 
  **  ** besides that , the overseas territories were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards . 
  ** even during the portuguese colonial war ( 1961 -- 1974 ) , a counterinsurgency war against independentist guerrilla and terrorism , the overseas territories of angola and mozambique ( portuguese overseas provinces at the time ) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming . 
  they were internationally notable centres of production of oil , coffee , cotton , cashew , coconut , timber , minerals ( like diamonds ) , metals ( like iron and aluminium ) , banana , citrus , tea , sisal , beer ( cuca and laurentina were successful beer brands produced locally ) , cement , fish and other sea products , beef and textiles . 
  tourism was also a fast developing activity in portuguese africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estado_novo_%28portugal%29#economy  in mainland portugal , the growth rate of the economy during the war years ranged from 6 % -11 % , and in post war years 2-3 % . 
  ** this is substantially higher than the vast majority of other european nations . 
  other indicators like gdp as percentage of western europe would indicate that portugal was rapidly catching up to its european neighbors . 
  ** in 1960 , at the initiation of salazar 's more outward-looking economic policy influenced by a new generation of technocrats , portugal 's per capita gdp was only 38 percent of the ec-12 average ; by the end of the salazar period , in 1968 , it had risen to 48 percent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war compare that with what happened due to that `` proud '' day :  the former colonies faced severe problems after independence .
