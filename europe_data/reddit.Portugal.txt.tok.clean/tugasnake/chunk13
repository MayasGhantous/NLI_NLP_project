  ** devastating and violent civil wars followed in angola and mozambique , which lasted several decades , claimed millions of lives , and resulted in large numbers of displaced refugees . 
  ** economic and social recession , authoritarianism , lack of democracy and other elemental civil and political rights , corruption , poverty , inequality , and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary zeal . ], 
  a level of social order and economic development comparable to what had existed under portuguese rule , including during the period of the colonial war , became the goal of the independent territories . 
   demobilized by the departing portuguese military authorities after the independence of portuguese guinea had been agreed , ** a total of 7,447 black guinea-bissauan african soldiers who had served in portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the paigc after the independence of the new african country . 
  **  fear of reprisals and impending changes in political and economic status by the marxist governments of the new african states resulted in the peaceful ** exodus of over one million portuguese citizens of european , african and mixed ethnicity ** from the newly independent african territories to portugal , brazil , south africa , and other countries . 
   the new governments of angola and mozambique , faced a severe set of challenges as devastating civil wars broke out in both countries . 
  ** lasting several decades , these ongoing conflicts would eventually claim over two million lives and an even greater number of refugees , while destroying much of the infrastructure in both nations . 
  ** resentments over economic difficulties caused by failed government policies , the general disenfranchisement of political opponents , and widespread corruption at the highest levels of government eroded the initial optimism present at independence . 
  these problems were exacerbated by a tendency to consolidate power by directing public anger against ethnic portuguese , mixed-race africans , and those who had supported the former colonial regime . 
   many of the local black soldiers that served in the portuguese army and who had fought against the insurgents were demobilized by portuguese authorities and left behind in africa . 
  the most infamous reprisal occurred in guinea-bissau . 
  demobilized by the portuguese authorities and abandoned to their fate , a total of 7,447 black african soldiers who had served in portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the paigc after portuguese forces ceased hostilities . 
  in a statement in the party newspaper n\u00f4 pintcha ( in the vanguard ) , a spokesman for the paigc revealed that many of the ex-portuguese indigenous african soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of cumer\u00e1 , portogole , and mansab\u00e1 . 
   in 1973 , on the eve of the revolution , portugal 's per capita gdp had reached 56.4 percent of the ec-12 average . 
  in 1975 , the year of maximum revolutionary turmoil , portugal 's per capita gdp declined to 52.3 percent of the ec-12 average . 
  convergence of real gdp growth toward the ec average occurred as a result of portugal 's economic resurgence since 1985 . 
  ** in 1991 portugal 's gdp per capita climbed to 54.9 percent of the ec average , exceeding by a fraction the level attained just during the worst revolutionary period . 
  **  for many decades to come after independence , the economies of the three former portuguese african territories involved in the war continued to remain problematic due to continuing internecine political conflicts and power struggles as well as inadequate agricultural production caused by disruptive government policies resulting in high birth mortality rates , widespread malnutrition , and disease . 
  ** by the 21st century , the human development index of angola , mozambique and guinea-bissau , were among the lowest in the world , while corruption and social inequality soared . 
  **  after 1974 , the deterioration in central planning effectiveness , economic development and growth , security , education and health system efficiency , was rampant . 
  none of the newly independent ex-portuguese african states made any significant economic progress in the following decades , and political progress in terms of democratic processes and protection of individual human rights was either minimal or nonexistent . 
  ** with few exceptions , the new regimes ranked at the bottom of human development and gdp per capita world tables . 
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_colonial_war it really takes some strong brainwashing to convince someone that in a country with nearly 900 years of glorious history one of it 's worst moments is the best . 
   no he is being down voted for saying that ** all imigrants ** are destroying his culture and that they are ** evil ** . 
  where did i say all immigrants and claimed that they are evil ? 
   portugal tried the hardest to keep it and failed miserably failed miserable ? 
  we fought a war against guerrillas supported by the ussr , and some by the usa , with barely no allies and still managed to achieve a military victory in angola and mozambique whilst our economy and those of our colonies were growing at a huge rate despite the war effort . 
  only in guinea-bissau did we fail to achieve victory , with the war stalemated , but even then it was far from `` failing miserably '' ...  the thin vial of portuguese power was erased by the development of the information age . 
  no , we erased our power when the revolutionaries took power and decided to end a centuries old empire in the space of a year . 
  nobody could have ended our power but ourselves , worst case scenario we would have had to leave guinea-bissau but that would 've been a minor loss that would have had the positive effect of allowing us to focus in angola and mozambique which were our two biggest colonies . 
   no longer did they see a great european power dominating them but a tiny country of less than 10 million people dwarfed by other european powers . 
  yet that tiny country of less than 10 million people succeeded in kicking guerrillas armed with soviet equipment , including anti-air weaponry that the americans did n't even know about , off the borders of angola and mozambique . 
   mozambique and angola knew they had the will and the people to beat the tiny nation of portugal . 
  yet they failed miserably at that , by the time the war ended all of the territory of angola and mozambique was under our control with the terrorists only able to make operations in the border before fleeing back with their tails between their legs . 
  only guinea-bissau actually had a shot at achieving a military victory against us and by 1974 they were unable to do so . 
   and they won . 
  sure they did , but only because portugal committed suicide as before that they were getting absolutely destroyed by us . 
   they also paid for it twice over . 
  political instability and corruption . 
  make it thrice , they 'll never recover for the mistakes that happened in 1974 . 
  we built those country and then left it , since it 's not their creation they 'll never be able to properly take care of it . 
   but they were free to sort out the real differences without colonial fuckery . 
  lol yea , i 'm sure the average person in those countries prefers to live under a super corrupt and inept regime that brought them nothing but a decline in their quality of life rather than under a benevolent european leadership . 
   now they 're some of the fastest growing economies in africa . 
  not really , they 're economy is heavily reliant on exportation of resources and with the decline in the price of oil they 're struggling hard . 
   do n't be so naive to think your tiny country kept these countries stable and productive . 
  my tiny country built those nations , they would n't exist without us and as history has proved they regressed economically and socially without us . 
   you kept the local population subjugated and enslaved to export it 's raw materials to your little european country . 
  once they saw behind the curtain they rose up and won . 
  nothing but ignorance , check the growth rates of portuguese africa in the second half of the 20th century before we left and the disgrace that happened afterwards . 
  to this day they 're still trying to achieve a level of social order and economic development compared to what existed under our rule . 
  stay butthurt mate , portuguese master race coming through time and time again to do gods work with less than 10 million people . 
  for democracy we would be better off celebrating the 25th of november , that 's really when we secured it . 
  straight outta / pol /, 
  abandoning most of our territory , along with half a million portuguese people and condemning millions to war and poverty at the hands of incredibly incompetent and corrupt governments . 
  the worst part is that we still celebrate the day that led to that happening . 
  portuguese immigrants are hard working and integrate well into the societies they move to . 
  even then we 're not obligated to accept immigrants just because other countries accepted portuguese people . 
   the thing is : there is no cultural homogeneity . 
  really ? 
  i can go outside my house right now and the overwhelming majority of people around ( minus tourists , lol ) are white , catholic or agnostic , speak portuguese and feel portuguese . 
  we 're nearly 900 years old , our border has been the same since the 13th century . 
  we were founded on a religion which to this day is still professed by pretty much every religious person in this country , we 've got a glorious history that allowed us to spread our culture and language in many places , so much so that portuguese is the most spoken language in the southern hemisphere , and like fifth in the whole world . 
  we 're also wealthy in literature , music and gastronomy . 
  if by your standards portugal is not culturally homogeneous then no other country is either . 
   for example , the right to choose a religion is a core value of our society . 
  no , not really . 
  portugal was founded on catholicism and for most of our history that has been our only religion . 
  that core value you mention is american , not portuguese . 
   moreover , historically portugal was accepting of other cultures , lol , we were born out of the crusades and eventually forced jews and muslims to convert to christianity or leave the country . 
  our empire started on the religious fervour to reconquer all of north africa all the way to jerusalem . 
  we did adopt muslim techniques , but in no way did we accept their culture as they were our eternal enemy . 
   tolerating diversity usually pays off . 
  yeah , must be why all european nations that are far more diverse than us are seeing the far-right rise and are suffering from a growing number of social problems that are unheard of in homogeneous portugal and eastern europe ? 
  a nation must have a dominant culture , multiculturalism weakens the social fabric of society by destroying the bonds that unite us as one people above religion , ethnicity and other things which may divide us . 
  that was a slogan for public consumption only , we were very integrated in the international community being one of the founding members of nato and efta . 
  salazar unlike what you may think was very smart when it came to geopolitics . 
  does n't matter , leftists will never forget their origins and will keep bringing it up while they themselves vote in parties that originally were marxist-leninist . 
  the most peaceful nations in the world are the ones where culture and ethnicity are strongly tied with nationality , in fact , a nation is supposed to be a group of people who share the same culture and blood . 
  in countries where you do n't see those three things entwined you often find constant conflict on religious and ethnic grounds that prevents the nation from moving forward . 
  you were blessed to be born in a nation where 95 % of your compatriots are just like you , and because this is all you know in your life you take if for granted and do n't value it , but the truth is that as france , the uk and sweden showed us it does n't take many decades to go from an homogeneous peaceful society , to a divided multicultural one with an ever growing number of social problems . 
  i hope we get to use it again , we 're lucky to be one of the oldest , most stable states in the world , but we jeopardize that by remaining in this failed tower of babel that is the eu . 
  the only thing currently keeping immigrants from coming to portugal in large numbers and bringing an end to our cultural and ethnic homogeneity is our shitty economy , but with other eu nations overburdened with migrants it 's only a matter of time before they start sending them our way . 
  i disagree that it can be interpreted as inciting violence , i do n't see how his post would lead anyone to go out and attack muslims , it poses no real threat . 
  you would literally have to fine thousands of europeans a day if you were to hold everyone to this standard . 
  well it sure did n't take long for someone to compare sd with the nazis , lol . 
  i do n't support hate speech laws . 
  the whole purpose of having freedom of speech is to protect controversial issues like the ones this ex-mp touched upon , to claim that we have freedom of speech in europe when we convict people for criticizing a backwards religion makes no sense . 
  ok , that makes sense then . 
  stupid law though . 
  a rational reaction to the inaction of the other parties when it comes to immigration . 
  if you refuse to acknowledge the concerns of your population and instead call them racists for daring to disagree with the current multiculturalist policy , then it 's only natural that they will flock to a party that takes their issues seriously and actually offers a viable solution to them . 
  how can he be convicted of racism when islam is a religion ? 
  very accurate representation of sweden and france . 
  not that i know of , it would probably be an expense to the portuguese state to have it back , but nevertheless it rightfully belongs to us . 
  the spanish committed themselves to give it back to us at the congress of vienna in 1815 , but i guess they decided to take a really long siesta before making good on their pledged word ... 
  human ingenuity has got this , we 're a pretty adaptable species and we 'll find a way to deal with this . 
   the republicans pretty much just ran on a platform of only getting white voters , and luckily they lost due to changing demographics yay , celebrating the dwindling numbers and the declining influence of the white race !, 
  :d soon enough the us will be a progressive society free of hate !, 
   talking about the whole package , europe can be very shitty as well .
