  enlighten me then , what is it that i 'm not seeing ? 
   are you saying that there maybe something genetic about this ??? 
  it 's very much a racial issue , even when you account for socio-economic status black people are still far more prone to crime than whites . 
  [ here 's another comment i made on this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18w2ji/homicide_rate_in_europe_vs_usa_1378x935/c8ij604 ), 
  because home is where the heart is , and for a british person london is looking less and less like home . 
  seeing your culture and people be replaced by others is not something that most people like to watch , and this is exactly what multiculturalism boils down to : a decline in the influence of the native population in favour of foreigners . 
   to be fair , the program was not universally acclaimed . 
  on twitter , a viewer named andre ulveseter said : `` went to throw a log on the fire , got mixed up , and smashed it right into the tv . '',

  i tend to put as much effort in my comments as those who reply to me . 
  if a guy is going to try to discredit my opinions by mentioning that i go to x or y subreddit then he should be happy that i even bothered to reply with a pic . 
   my ancestors worked to establish a foundation for their family on which we could build ( ie : money , education , proper values ) , not for racial supremacy or to establish a structure that makes life shitty for brown people . 
  it 's not about making life shitty for brown people , it 's about freedom of association .

   the color of someone 's skin did i mention skin colour anywhere in this thread ? 
  nope . 
  race is far more than that . 
   `` alike '' i am to someone in genetic terms race does have to do with how much alike you are to someone . 
   like the desire to get ahead by your skills and what you have to offer rather than some misguided sense of kinship based on skin pigment . 
  or like the desire to cry about how people rather stick to their own kind instead of hiring foreigners . 
  seriously if you pick a shitty employee that is from your country instead of a more skilled immigrant then the market will punish you , nevertheless you should be able to give preference to your own nationality/race/whatever criteria without being called out or forced by the government to treat everyone equally .

  no , it 's not about white guilt . 
  it 's not like he used / r/whiterights as a way to discredit me and it 's not like you 're defending that whites should forfeit a natural advantage that comes from being a native and living amongst their race just so that non-whites can have an easier time . 
  / s you dumb twat , our ancestors worked hard so that we would have an advantage , why should non-whites who just recently arrived expect to be treated equally as the descendants of those who built this godamn place ? 
  i 'll care more about those who are more alike me than some random with whom i share no common ancestor in the last thousand years , if you think that 's unfair and your jimmies are rustled by it , then too bad . 
  because we 're not guided by logic but by the belief that multiculturalism is inherently good . 
  swedes favouring compatriots over foreigners in their own nation , what about it ? 
   yet again half of [ 1 ] / r/europe acts like a racist cesspitt i 'm sorry your multiculti feelings got hurt , better get used to it though !,

  why would they ? 
  the obstruction of capitalism is exactly the reason why unemployment got so high . 
  it 's state intervention that causes anomalies such as this , they need to liberalize the labour market to revert this dangerous trend unless they want all of the spanish youth to work in the black market or abandon spain . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/15jhg7/sarcasm_blacks_are_several_times_deadlier_than/ blacks are more likely to kill you than gun owners . 
  [ correlation between race and crime rate by city ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itpse.jpg ) http://www.aarp.org/travel/destinations/info-02-2012/five-most-dangerous-cities.1.html http://money.cnn.com/gallery/real_estate/2013/01/23/dangerous-cities/index.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._cities_with_large_african_american_populations clearly blacks are a bigger threat to your safety than guns , this is statistics and acknowledging them is not racist . 
  for all you know i may blame the higher crime rate of the african american population on their lower socio-economic status . 
  it 's only racist if i blame that on their race . 
  i actually do believe this is mostly a racial issue , their environment does n't help either but it 's not the main factor since whites from the same socio-economic background are n't as criminal . 
  you seem to have no problem acknowledging that higher levels of gun ownership lead to higher rates of gun homicide , why not do the same when it comes to race and crime ? 
   i 'll take every african in the world in my country over one racist , uneducated prick such as yourself . 
  so you would rather destroy the us and plunge the world into chaos than let one racist in , good lord !, 
  the extent some of you will go to deny any association with racism is ludicrous !, 
   in my city alone last year more people were killed by guns than u.s. troops killed in afghanistan 33 % of the total population is african american , there 's your problem son . 
   today we 're talking about military grade assault rifles that can unleash more firepower in 2 seconds than 20 men armed with muskets could achieve in 2 minutes . 
  from my understanding semi auto rifles are rarely used for killing , most of the gun homicides are caused by handguns . 
  do you want those banned too ? 
   our constitution needs to be changed to reflect the realities of the 21st century it 's surely your right to shape the constitution as you see fit , but i personally see no reason to touch the 2nd amendment . 
  i consider the right to hold and bear arms to be at the root of what it 's like to be american and i ca n't see a scenario were americans would be unarmed like europeans . 
  for that to happen the 2nd amendment would have to be repealed and that clearly is n't going to happen , so why bother banning rifles which account for a small percentage of the total gun homicides when handguns will never be touched ? 
   you are from europe correct ? 
  yup . 
   i 'm just asking because i always assumed his philosophy and brand of politics would translate into sheer lunacy across the atlantic . 
  it does , the average european is n't a libertarian by no means , here it 's pretty much universally accepted that a state should be involved in far more than what a minarchy deals with . 
   i happen to have a lot of respect for the man , and his son rand paul . 
  his detractors dismiss him as crazy , and that 's why i thought you were using his image in all those pictures you were posting . 
  nah , that 's just the doom paul meme . 
  it 's meant to exaggerate a position and be all doomsday about it , not to dismiss rp as a lunatic . 
  there was a great video explaining what was the big deal around ron paul but it was deleted : / in short i would have to say that it is because he brought a lot of people into libertarianism and he 's that rare breed of politician who actually stands by what he says and had an actual plan to fix the mess in the us .
