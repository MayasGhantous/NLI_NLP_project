more than half of the comments seem to be reasonable and by that i mean on the same level than / r/unitedkingdom those are some very low standards . 
   it 's just ratebeer data , so yes , it just reflects ratebeer users ' tastes !, 
  i do n't see that that needs to provoke such a bitter response !, 
  / u/turnusb is always bitter . 
   creating a monetary union that only benefits themselves in the long run and using their leverage over the central bank to effectively govern half of southern europe , turning the affected countries into low-wage low-skill low-infrastructure corporate paradises on the pretext of a recovery plan which has absolutely no economic credibility and appears to just be a way to put downwards pressure on the bargaining power of european labour ? 
    that 's not good , unless you 're a ceo . 
  [ germany did n't do that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1cthg2/it_would_be_helpful_for_politicians_to_remind/c9kaca0 ) . 
   holly cow , how many parts of spain want to be independent from spain ? 
  all of them . 
   the place was absolutely horrifying , like a chicken battery farm but for people . 
  it would be much worse if it was illegal . 
   because finnish . 
   i 'd be pretty good at placing asia , europe and some south african countries and south american that 's what you get for playing paradox games . 
   what i 'm sorry , i meant to say , `` arguments that justify killing people are harmful therefore such arguments are bad . '', 
   arguments have been used to kill people therefore arguments are bad . 
  arguments that are used to kill people try to kill people therefore such arguments are bad . 
  nevertheless , imo , these should n't be censored , only ignored , it 's no reason to trump over free speech . 
   this obviously was n't during the same time period , but the irish famine in the 19th century was hugely exacerbated by laissez-faire capitalism . 
  if by laissez-faire capitalism you mean the ( end of the ) age of mercantilism , government quotas and ownership of the farms by englishmen and anglo-irish aristocracy , then yes , `` laissez-faire capitalism '' ( which is more properly described as feudalism ) caused the irish famine . 
  i do challenge people to [ try and find famines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_famines ) in the recent times ( going back at least a century ) that happened because of free markets . 
  it seems to me they all happen or were exacerbated by government action ( like armed conflicts or collectivizations ) . 
   people remember the hunger . 
  it 's just a bit `` insulting '' to call it targeted genocide against a specific nation . 
  when everyone suffered . 
  [ according to a soviet author , `` before they died , people often lost their senses and ceased to be human beings . '', 
  yet one of stalin 's lieutenants in ukraine stated in 1933 that the famine was a great success . 
  it showed the peasants `` who is the master here . 
  it cost millions of lives , but the collective farm system is here to stay . '' . . 
  ] ( http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/ukra.html ) if this is n't genocide then i do n't know what is . 
   you stored that picture on your pc for a year ? 
  i do n't even ... 
  i still have pictures that i took back in 2011 , why , what 's the matter ? 
   well , i do n't agree . 
  making racist remarks is insulting , making an argument for socialism is n't . 
  saying `` blacks should be sent back to africa '' is , in my view , about the same level of moronic than saying `` we should steal from those who have to give to those who do n't '' , in a practical sense they both resort to violence or the threat to violence and both ideologies have been used as an excuse to kill people , so i really do n't understand why one is considered a violent ideology and should be a ban-able offence and the other gets a free pass on those same accusations . 
   how much would you like people mentioning that `` it 's no miracle portugal 's economy is in the gutter , that 's where africa starts '' in every thread ? 
  i would n't care at all , i 'd downvote and move on . 
  there 's plenty of idiots around and they all have their ideas they just have to share with the rest of the world , that 's no reason to resort to banning people . 
  i 'll always take freedom of speech over censorship any day of the week . 
   he 's also a fantastic artist in ... well , another subreddit that does n't like to be mentioned . 
  let 's say / r/lithuaniancommonwealthsphere r/polandcantintospace ? 
   are you kidding ? 
  / u/tuasnake was one of the biggest racist piece of shit redditers / r/europe had for a time . 
  if racism as a violent ideology should lead to a ban , then i say communism should as well , it 's an ideology with more blood on its hand than nazism itself . 
  your very argument could get you banned , i do n't know if you realise this . 
   that said , what happened to that ` greece , pay your debts ' guy ? 
  he was amusing . 
  txampion ? 
  he was banned several times and kept coming back though he eventually gave up . 
  yeah , no wonder . 
   that thread is hilarious . 
  apparently portugal 's biggest problems are germans , muslims and gypsies . 
  whom said that , exactly ? 
   ... thank god that bullshit is n't welcome here . 
  yeah , thank fuck people are banned for having different opinions !, 
   what were you saying about koleye ? 
  i like koleye . 
  koleye is american and he 's not downvoted . 
   after the mods instituted a policing policy things have gotten much better , in my opinion . 
  an echo-chamber is n't something better . 
   and your accusations against the mods confuse me a bit , since you do n't even know what people were writing which got them banned . 
  wait , am i supposed to know which post got people banned ? 
  i 've even asked / u/tugasnake what got him banned and even him told me he did n't know and that when he was banned he had n't even written anything that could be considered offensive in days . 
   is that a qualified basis on which to draw the conclusions that you are ? 
  dude , the subreddit is in the gutter and the comments here are becoming like those on / r/politics , and the only thing the moderation is doing is banning people with different opinions because some people might take offence . 
   a lot of quality posters left because of the influx of racists , a point you keep conveniently ignoring . 
  a lot of whom , exactly ? 
  a couple of guys that do n't know how to downvote and ignore ? 
  are you seriously comparing that to the amount of guys that left or stopped coming here because whenever there 's some actual discussion the moderation team makes sure the outcome is a train of [ deleted ] ? 
   ... i 'm not sure what you mean by that . 
  that americans are not being downvoted no matter what they say . 
   so what were people actually posting ? 
  ask the mods , from what i 've seen and i 've been told , people have been banned simply for saying what they think because some deemed it offensive . 
   if the mods are a bit paranoid they have good reason for it . 
  many extreme subreddits , like / r/niggers , have several times `` attacked '' our subreddit . 
  back before the mods were active , there were these accusations as well and yet the community always regulated itself and the few trolls we did get always were downvoted . 
  it was certainly better than now where there 's hardly meaningful discussion and those who say anything even remotely controversial risk getting banned . 
   also - downvoting americans no matter what they say is really out of hand . 
  no , it 's not , take / u/koleye for example . 
   what exactly is your definition of ` remotely controversial ' ? 
  as far as i know the mods are only banning people who are blatantly and consistently spouting racism and not contributing to the discussion or adding anything of value beside bile and hate . 
  yup , it 's their excuse for every ban , / u/theskynet even went on / r/portugal [ saying that they were banning people from r/wightright ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/1gjbxn/algu%c3%a9m_banido_do_reurope/cal78cf ) even though that was clearly not the case , it 's like the us mccarthyism but with accusations of racism . 
   wait , did you seriously link to something he said one year ago !? 
  hey , it 's the link in the picture which i had stored in my pc . 
   why ? 
  why do you care so much ? 
  because the things he argued for ( moderation ) ruined this subreddit . 
   very true , but is calling people names an opinion ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12v4zb/by_the_quran_we_will_kill_you_all_you_faggots/c6ye5tk ) , check the original conversation for yourself , he was just doing his usual `` omg stop discriminating '' thing and i got tired of his shit . 
   how many people have been banned before ? 
  so many fucking people , this reddit changed so much in the last year , back then you had so many discussions and nowadays the comments are so void of actual content . 
  there was even [ a thread on / r/portugal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/1gjbxn/algu%c3%a9m_banido_do_reurope/ ) about who had n't been banned from r/europe , that 's how shitty things have gotten . 
   i have know idea why this is relevant in this thread , but you seem like a bit of a dick . 
  and i am a bit of a dick , yet i never censored people for having different opinions . 
   i 'm one of the most fervent supporters of european integration in this subreddit , and i could not say that with a straight face . 
  you 're also [ someone that brags about reporting people to the mods for homophobia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yjhwjca.png ) because they call you a sissy , so it 's people like you that are making / r/europe more and more like an echo chamber . 
   mods should intervene as little as possible . 
  in r/europe ? 
  what a fucking joke , here you 'll get banned if you say something that 's even remotely controversial . 
  better dead than red !,
