  raisins , you 're meant to eat a bunch right before the year changes . 
  do n't ask me why because i dunno . 
  i stick with drinking champagne . 
  just today i posted [ an opinion article ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/15pwbw/fiscal_cliff_the_great_american_ostrich_opini%c3%a3o/ ) on r/portugal regarding the american fiscal cliff , [ here 's a translation to english ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsicnoticias.sapo.pt%2fopinionmakers%2fjose_gomes_ferreira%2f2012%2f12%2f30%2ffiscal-cliff--the-great-american-ostrich4 ) . 
  the article is quite good despite the google translation not being optimal . 
  simply put , the americans really need to balance their budget and ca n't continue to stack up their debt while delaying the underlining problem which is their deficits . 
  so far they are n't dealing with it , they 've raised the debt ceiling and compromised on little , they are n't being capable of increasing revenue and/or cutting spending , and as much it might be bad for them if they reach no compromise till tomorrow , it would be much worse if they do n't take the appropriate measures and continue to get into debt , that would be to continue blowing the bubble which is all fine and dandy till it bursts . 
  on a globalized world such as ours where our economies are so interdependent , this is also a very serious issue for europe . 
  the eu economy is the largest in the world , theirs is # 2 , it 's no joke , just like the eu member-states are working hard to fix their government deficits , so has the usa to do the same , they just ca n't rely on the us dollar forever . 
   you 've obviously never seen r/murica the top submission is an us passport ? 
  lol , good luck in getting in places like iran with that !, 
  there 's no comparison , [ portugal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:portugalpassportvisafree.png ) clearly beats the [ usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_citizens_visa_req_map.png ) !, 
   haha , i was just listening to the last song you linked me again . 
  that one is bookmarked as well , i just forgot to respond there . 
  : b i 'm still very likely to grab some rock or metal when i want music , though . 
  :d [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hltozptwm8 ) has voice but it 's the one currently playing here and i think you 'll enjoy it , 
   do n't worry , rick 's never going to give you up . 
  or let you down .

   time to remove kebab from premises !, 
   a company treating their workers as any other form of capital in an unregulated market would be quite successful , at least in the short run , and other companies would be forced to follow suit to keep cost down . 
  workers could n't avoid such companies , because every one of them would have to do it to remain competitive . 
  so , the state says you need to give each worker a certain amount of vacation days , you ca n't just fire them when they become pregnant , and you have to maintain a minimum standard of safety at the workplace , because that 's what we as a society have decided to be beneficial for the whole . 
  since those rules apply to every company , the normal mechanism of the free market still works , and a race to the bottom is prevented . 
  you have to look at things from a broader perspective , there 's no monopoly on labour demand just as there is n't one on labour supply , a race to the bottom is avoided the moment workers are n't willing to work ( if it 's not beneficial for them to work ) . 
  it 's the same logic with the minimum wage , it 's there but the vast majority are paid more than that ; if a company does n't provide the benefits you mentioned like safety in the workplace or paid holidays , then its workers will either demand more compensation or work elsewhere and the company would lose out on them , it 's all about demand and supply , the government tinkering with this leads to inefficiency and unemployment . 
  the law also never apply to everyone , pardon my ad absurdum but the free market would collapse if you instated something like `` minimum wage : 10.000 $ / day '' or `` minimum 6 months of paid vacation/year '' , even if it was a law made for every company . 
  you must not forget that there 's always the informal economy which grows every time the government intervenes and creates a gap between the market optimal and the market post-regulation . 
  that and the rest of the world , as you ca n't enforce these laws outside your borders - the maximum you can do is drive away some forms of labour , but it will still happen somewhere as long as it is profitable . 
   spain does exactly the same thing with regards to cap and other hand outs for roads-to-nowhere . 
  so did portugal . 
  yet ( i personally think that ) this is n't an argument against the eu as much as it is an argument against the member-state itself . 
  i certainly wo n't ask for portugal to leave the eu because we could n't manage the funds provided , if anything , its our own damn fault !, 
  we ought to be complaining to lisbon , not brussels !, 
   the `` we '' that can block `` them '' does n't appear to exist . 
  at least i have seen no evidence for it on the eu level . 
  bah , if france can get their way , why ca n't you ? 
  you 're a full-member state just like they are !, 
  surely you 're not insane and wo n't continue to do the same things and expecting a different result , right ? 
  why do n't you do what they 're doing but in pursuit of your own policies ? 
   all eucrats seem concernted with is lining their own pockets and telling themselves what a wonderful job they have done . 
  just like your mps ? 
  iirc there was an expenses scandal there quite recently , yet i did n't see anyone suggesting that england or wales should leave the uk because of it . 
  is n't this analogous to your claim that the uk should leave the eu because there are corrupt eu politicians ? 
   if you 've signed up to a treaty with someone and they fail to adhere to it i do n't understand the rationale that says signing up to another treaty with them that binds you closer is a good thing . 
  then do n't sign just another treaty . 
  sign something that 's actually binding , increase eu integration , do something proper , create an agency accountable to the whole union and with actual responsibilities and goals . 
  eu institutions similar to [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/departments_of_the_united_kingdom_government#list_of_departments_of_the_united_kingdom_government ) or [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_federal_executive_departments#executive_departments_of_the_present ) . 
  it works elsewhere , why should n't it work here ? 
  ( or , to put it in another way , if what we 're currently doing is n't working , is n't that what we 're missing ? ), 
   to use a ( lame ) analogy , if you are burgled you dont invite the thief to live with you . 
  you can be just as burgled from the uk as you can from the eu , no ? 
  shed light into the eu , make it more direct and more accountable , and i 'm certain you will surely trust brussels just as much as you trust westminster ( assuming you trust westminster ) . 
   it is not about geography , it is about legitimacy ; who you can assent to govern in your name , trusting that this governance will be [ both ] representative of , [ and ] accountable to , your needs . 
  the representatives of the people and the people themselves . 
  as for where the representatives sit , i 'm guessing holyrood , westminster or brussels is irrelevant , no ? 
  at least from my perspective here in porto , they 're either 3 hours away by car in lisbon or 3 hours away by car and plane in brussels , they represent me equally . 
   we already accept the concept that the scots may believe their identity to be sufficiently different to justify independence from the uk , why should the uk and europe be any different ? 
  they should n't . 
  what i 'm trying to understand is why you would want to leave when you 're still a sovereign nation and democratically represented within europe ? 
  you do can leave and not explain a thing , but i personally just find it odd that you criticise the eu of the same things that scotland criticises the uk . 
   because as has been discussed ad nauseum the uk position is generally a minority one and even most british people do not like the idea of the eu , certainly not as it stands now . 
  but it is a majority position , you just are n't standing up for it !, 
  all you seem to care about is getting an opt-out for yourselves !, 
  that 's not solving the problem , that 's distancing yourself from it !, 
   centre-right ! = free market . 
  for the most part , they 're positively correlated . 
   any french government is protectionist . 
  sarkozy was no exception and he was seen as fairly `` free market '' by the french populace though his policies were largely rolled back by hollande . 
  france , france , france , yeah , i agree with you , they 're definitely lacking in economic policy , but we outnumber them and can easily block them when they try to pull that shit on an eu level . 
   we still have cap and all the other shite so if `` we '' are the majority clearly we need our heads testing . 
  or to commit to the eu project like the french did as opposed to work only to delay their proposals and to get special clauses exempting us from it . 
  if they can push legislation favourable to them , why ca n't we ? 
   ah , the solution for every problem in euroland - `` quick !, 
  it is n't working , we must try it again only moreso ! '', 
  you were the one who said the laws were n't being followed . 
  if not by furthering integration , how are you meant to enforce these laws that are sometimes ignored ? 
   who in their right mind would want to give up more powers and commit to federalisation when we have the problems that we do ? 
  it 'd be insanity . 
  because that very same federalisation will help you in tackling the current problems . 
  you said it yourself , `` the laws may be there in principle but they are sometimes ignored in practice '' !, 
  who in his right mind would want to continue with such a loose integration when our economies are so interconnected ? 
   i was n't trying to say the uk is exempt from these charges , but all the major eu economic policies seem to be tending towards state interference lately . 
  so you 'll just leave even though you 're a full member ? 
  why not push back on those policies ? 
   the problem is that `` we '' free-market tending liberals appear to be in a minority across the eu . 
  if that 's so , why are `` we '' a majority in the european parliament and are most eu member-states currently governed by centre-right parties ? 
   so yes , the laws may be there in principle but they are sometimes ignored in practice . 
  so , further integration to avoid this ? 
   yes , ** form now on ** i will just assume turks just run around spraying each other with acid . 
  it 's `` from now on '' . 
  just please do n't assume that all portuguese are grammar nazis . 
   [ this is the real version . 
  ] ( http://img7.joyreactor.com/pics/post/funny-pictures-auto-map-how-x-see-373187.jpeg ) nonsense , what everyone constantly sees is sweden the dick and finland the balls . 
   we are about to find out with the scottish referendum , if they do n't hold to the notion of a common familial sentiment then they can go their way , and i shall ( with some sadness ) wave them off . 
  replace scottish with british and it 's pretty much the same regarding the uk and the eu . 
  well , if scotland leaves the uk and if the uk leaves the eu , we 'll still be close , scotland wo n't drift towards sweden and the uk wo n't drift towards the usa . 
   not in the absence of a common demos to whom i am willing to assent to common kratos , regardless of whether ` my ' man gets in or ` his ' . 
  are you saying that we europeans are n't too closely related to be able to live together under the same principles ?
