  agreed . 
   still i fully support the right of each institution to decide upon this matter , this is not a matter that the state should get involved into . 
  no , children should never be denied parents based on the criteria `` the father likes in the arse '' or `` the mother likes scissoring '' , we have something called the constitution which has to be upheld at all times , and it could n't be more clear on this issue :  article 13  ( principle of equality )  1 . 
  every citizen shall possess the same social dignity and shall be equal before the law . 
  ** no one shall be ** privileged , favoured , ** prejudiced , deprived of any right ** or exempted from any duty ** on the basis of ** ancestry , sex , race , language , place of origin , religion , political or ideological beliefs , education , economic situation , social circumstances or ** sexual orientation ** . 
   this is where you should have pointed out that it 's ` sentences ' , man . 
  check the dates of my posts , that one i made it after waking up :p hey frisiandude , what do you think of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czeksvgjriq ) ? 
   [ poland , you 're my greatest ally ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bh6mx.gif ) [ the only people arguing against erasmus are those who 'll never get into a threesome ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wjtkk.gif ), 
   uat2d confirmed as faggot thank you for allowing me to adopt , you can ride me whenever . 
  oh , i still disagree with you about the `` let the institutions decide '' , this is about adoption , not about the transaction of goods and services , one should be free to do as he pleases as long as it is n't harmful to others - someone not allowing gays to adopt is extremely harmful to the children , they 're not cattle nor are they property owned by the institutions who take care of them or their foster parents , under no circumstance should they be denied parents , if the people who 're taking care of them disapprove of them being adopted by a gay couple , too fucking bad , they do n't own the children and ca n't decide for them if their new parents are appropriate or not . 
   yeah , probably . 
   what are these perks of being an eu member state , especially one that contributes the second highest amount of money to the pot ? 
  i doubt our economy would be less competitive in the eu market . 
  we are already outside the euro so it wo n't be because of the currency . 
  you 'd be out of the market and there would be tariffs imposed on british products just like they 're imposed on goods from elsewhere . 
  also , you 'd still have to comply with eu regulation for the products sold to the common market , which is still by far your largest buyer . 
  other than these barriers to trade , the freedom of movement of people , goods , services and capital would also be compromised , which could also be quite harmful to your economy which is so connected on the rest of europe . 
  these to me are very serious disadvantages , you 'd probably lose out on much more than what you pay the eu , but that 's up for the british to decide and i 'm sure you 'd be fine even if you did leave . 
  good for them , i 'd also pay less taxes if i could . 
   you see that 's the problem . 
  we can pretty much leave the eu and be fine and for many people little will change other than having to show our passports on the way into france when leaving the eurotunnel . 
  your economy will most definitely be less competitive within the eu market and you 'd also lose out on the perks of being an eu member-state so if i was british i 'd certainly think twice before voting ` yes ' to leaving . 
  however , if you do decide to do it will be within your own right and , imo , it will be your loss , so it 's not like i 'm that bothered with that possibility , if anything , the current situation where the uk is in but has serious doubts about being a part of the eu might even be more harmful than that of an actual british exit because if you do leave then that issue will be settled once and for all and intra-eu negotiations will be able to proceed more swiftly . 
   also , are you calling me a basement dweller ? 
   referendum i guess ? 
  it would be a good solution . 
  would you vote `` yes '' on that referendum about if homosexual couples should be able to adopt ? 
   hardly a good advert for britain staying in when the only two successful countries you can name actually are n't in the eu but have trading agreements with them . 
  you forgot the end of his post :  they ca n't be used as models for the rest of europe because they are small , rich countries with a special asset ( oil in norway , banking in switzerland ) . 
  sure , the uk could leave and be fine . 
  and sure , you easily make trade agreements with the rest of the eu . 
  but would this be beneficial for the uk itself ? 
  most europeans think it would n't , though it 's up for the british to decide . 
   belarus is not in the eu either . 
  it has n't banking system nor petrol , like the uk . 
  so take a guess how will the uk end , like belarus or like switzerland/norway . 
  the uk has petrol in the shetland islands . 
  not to mention that the uk has a stable democracy and a strong economy . 
  the country close by that is n't a part of the eu and that whose economy most resembles the uk i 'd say it 's turkey - though even so both countries are very different . 
  it sometimes happens, 
   probably , though you were being a tad dramatic . 
  i know i was , i started out with `` sorry for being an asshole '' x ), 
   it sounds like bloody satire whenever paedophiles are mentioned . 
  maybe my romantic life would be better !,

   i 'm currently a polish erasmus student in spain and let me tell you , you have no idea how mistaken you are yeah , nobody parties and fucks for taxpayers money , people do it on their own budget and because hey , you only live once . 
  there 's always the exception , some basement dwellers might rather stay on reddit as opposed to having a good time but that 's their own fault xd, 
   you 're just mad because while your friends were hanging out with spanish chicks , you would always stay in the room . 
  on the bright side , hell666 now may know some spanish such as `` oh si , cari\u00f1o , me gusta much\u00edsimo ! '' . 
  his friends probably taught him that as he did n't get to learn in from the spanish ladies . 
   not even by stealing piiggs money with the euro , can they stop unemployment . 
  not even anything can stop unemployment . 
   sounds sensible . 
    france can , of course , do as it pleases , but i 'd be up in arms if such a punitive level of taxation were introduced here . 
  as long as it 's only introduced in france , the uk might actually benefit !, 
   could n't read it ? 
  studies show it 's possible to read sentances where only the first and last letters of each word are correct , the middle ones are jumbled . 
  that 's no excuse to be careless with grammar . 
  it does make comprehension more difficult , if he is indeed english , he should go back to school . 
   it should be up to each individual institution to decide if homosexual couples can adopt or not . 
  what about state-run orphanages ? 
   the uk is by far the most morally deprived country in the western world . 
  what do you mean by morally deprived ? 
  they 're so uptight it 's sickening !, 
   you people are disgusting so they 're just like most real-life redditors then ? 
   belgium mentioned on the frontpage two consecutive days . 
  it was a good week . 
  are you even a country ? 
  my parents are not together and ** i 'm ** not sure ** it ** fucked me up . 
  i mean , i do n't have a girlfriend but that ** is ** not because of a deep seated cynicism about successful relationships but mainly because ** it 's ** saturday night and ** i 'm ** on reddit laughing at gifs rather than going out . ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ lonely sorry for being an asshole but are you actually english like your flair suggests ? 
  because i could n't read your post for shit and i 'm just a filthy foreigner who has never worked or lived in an english speaking country . 
   it 's interesting to note that the top marginal tax rate in the us was over 90 % for a well over a decade after ww2 ( e.g. , in 1952 it was 92 % above 200kusd and 90 % above 100kusd ; and 77 % above 50kusd ) , and remained at 70 % until reagan came to power . 
  apparently it did n't cause a major problem back then . 
  how convenient for you to ignore the fact that during ww2 people in the usa had no other good place to go and that in the post-ww2 the usa was the only country which had not been utterly devastated by the war and still tried to have a business friendly environment . 
  trying the same thing today where there 's no world war , where there 's serious competition to the usa economy and when you can so easily store your money wherever and travel/work/live elsewhere , it 's no surprise that any such insane tax rates fails spectacularly - just look at france , this new tax rate is not even close to 90 % , it 's only to incomes over 1 million euros and still the wealthy are all leaving france and settling in nearby countries , while france does increase the tax rate , their actual revenues from taxes go down and not up , it 's like killing the chicken that lays the golden eggs . 
   anyway , my dad has two dogs , i can test this when i visit him next time , i 'm sure they will react the same way . 
  do so . 
  but you have to be sure one will reply positively and another will reply negatively . 
  :p or you can just ask your dad if he can or can not communicate with his dogs and if they can or can not reply to them in their own manner , including answering positively or negatively . 
   that 's not how it works . 
  the dog will look down sad if your voice is angry , regardless of whether it just took a dump or saved your life . 
  not really , even if you ask the question just once and both dogs are next to you , they 'll answer differently to the same question . 
   you would have to wait for a long time , at least 18 years to fuck them . 
  unless you mean girls then fuck 'em straight outta the womb , idgaf nah , i was talking proper women . 
  but i 'd have to be an ingenious greedy evil motherfucker to establish a slavery and prostitution business . 
   yes but not this specific one thing that is so easy for humans . 
  `` dog # 1 , was it you who took a dump on the carpet ? '', 
  * if he looks down and sad , then `` yes '' is his answer , if he stares at you and at dog # 2 , then `` no '' is his answer . 
  * just because they do n't have vocal cords and speech abilities like us does n't mean we ca n't communicate with them . 
   uhhh ... no ? 
  i 'm not the vegetarian here , eryemil is . 
  yet you 're the only one with sand in your vagina . 
   finns treat cussing quite different from americans and brits for example and the liberal application of crude words easily carries to the foreign languages they speak . 
  dunno about this person , probably a troll , but sometimes finns just cluelessly blurt out obscenities without really thinking about the full implications . 
   dolphins are the only species that rapes and murders ** for fun ** i find that hard to believe . 
  look at humans , for example , they rape and murder a lot and it 's hardly ever for survival or reproduction . 
   human two year olds can answer yes/no questions , i do n't think any animal can do that . 
  they can do much much more . 
   pigs are capable of playing computer games . 
  so that 's what it is .
