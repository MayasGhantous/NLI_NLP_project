  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_luxembourg ) so it 's about ~ 15 % of luxembourg that is portuguese , we would n't even have to resort to violence , we 'd just have to get them into power and have them petition for annexation into the portuguese republic , we would then border germany and according to the rules of this game , be able to form a union with them - our debts would be cleared and the germans would be able to get some sun and enjoy nice beaches within their own country , profit !, 
   id choose portugal , but seeing the comments it seems they 'd rather have the atlantic ocean than spain . 
  send us some money and promise us some benefits and you 'd easily buy us into hispania just like you did in 1580  you are our hermanos , if we 're not talking football then it 's all love , it would be fine xd,

   guess where our current president , last dictator and his most brutal minister are from ? 
  i would n't recommend it . 
   if you do n't want it , you can give it to us , we 'll gladly take it  we could even move the capital to santiago de compostela , it would be closer to porto than lisbon currently is , though the moors might dislike of this idea :p [ portugaliza ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xjwo4.png ), 
   the east coast of the americas count for you , it 's just a little bit of water in between holy fuck , we so want brasil back . 
  suddenly our gdp would be larger than that of the uk , how sweet would that be ? 
   but , but . . we did n't get in conflicts with anyone in the region . 
  we play nice : < is romania even considered in the balkans ?

   in portugal everyone calls your country macedonia . 
  in portugal and elsewhere , though that map is about the official government position . 
  though i 'm quite sure portugal was n't even asked about this , it hardly matters for us , it 's certainly not like we 're making a statement against macedonia . 
   and galician is pratically portuguese . 
  perhaps it would be best to say that portuguese is galician considering that it was portugal that declared independence from galicia . 
  as someone from porto , i have a much easier time understanding galician than i have in understanding portuguese from the azores - if the azorian dialect qualifies as portuguese , then galician is definitely portuguese . 
   imagine becoming like those arab countries with no taxes . 
  `` and for the first tax cut in recent portuguese history : we are cutting the taxes to zero ! '' . 
  so much wine would be drunk the country itself would go on a hangover . 
  however that wo n't happen for a while . 
  saddly . 
  it would be great for a while , just like when we found gold in brasil or diamonds in africa . 
  unfortunately it seems this time we 'll actually have to deal with our shit . 
  actually it 's more like * great jewish state * as * juden * is german for * jew * and * [ gro\u00dfdeutschland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) * means * greater germany * and * gro\u00dfbritannien * means * great britain * . 
   europe is n't becoming centralised to prevent war though even if that was the aim of the european coal and steel community . 
  the idea behind the ecsc was to create economic interdependence through free trade which has clearly worked perfectly but political union is something else entirely and i think potentially will only increase disharmony as different interests clash ( see : yugoslavia , not that i think the eu will end in war of course ) . 
  the principle of subsidiarity in the eu will always apply , there will only be cooperation and shared decision making in the matters where it 's benefitial for us all to work together . 
  it 's not like the uk will be no more and european bureaucrats will occupy westminster , the local matters will continue to be dealt with on a local or national level , it wo n't be like yugoslavia where serbs ruled over croats and bosnians and the like .

  there will always be fierce competition among us , the difference is that now we are n't killing each other .

   it 's stupid to request an alternative to austerity , because that implies austerity is a solution . 
  so austerity is bad but you know no of other alternatives ? 
  i 'm still waiting for what we could do which would be better for us than out current budget cuts that wo n't involve other countries paying for our debts . 
   with austerity you can be sure portugal will not pay for it 's excessive spending because it will be quite broke and defaulting . 
  is austerity really to blame for this ? 
  is n't s\u00f3crates massive spending the real culprit ? 
  because if our government had n't spent that insane amount of money , we would n't have any need for this austerity , you know ? 
   care to counter argument i ca n't argue against what was n't an argument in the first place . 
   should we just stand by your neoliberal college textbook illuminated word ? 
  you 're the one talking as if the government was out trying to eliminate the middle class , why should anyone listen to your ramblings when such accusations are so ludicrous ? 
   i 'm portuguese and our government is completely set in eliminating the middle class no . 
   if we prolong austerity long enough , it will work , inequality will disappear because we will be all equal in being poor and dead . 
  oh , for fuck 's sake , stop being a demagogue , austerity is simply cutting back excessive public spending , if anything it 's these massive public deficits and not the lack of them that make us all equally poor ( with the exception of the nomenklatura ) . 
   merkel ( and germany by extension ) as the flag bearer of austerity , objectively has part of the blame . 
  present an alternative to austerity that does n't involve germany and not portugal being the one paying for our excessive spending . 
   why do n't southerners like to blast the fuck out of some hard metal or hard techno or hard rap and jump around like crazy while chugging ouzo or whatever ?

   i completely agree with this statement . 
  [ your post is the suv and the other redditors are the truck ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4h0fqja1qko#t=10s ) . 
   now please tell me angela how the fuck is this merkel 's fault ? 
   the french are paid up members of the `` ever closer political integration '' club . 
  in fact they along with the germans founded it . 
  we 're not , never have been and never will be interested in `` ever closer political integration '' . 
   simple as that really . 
  you were n't in originally but like the uk , 20 others member-states also were n't in at the beginning . 
  yet everybody else continues to make their case and to try and change europe for the better . 
  if the uk is the exception that would rather not discuss matters and that instead prefers to get opt-out clauses and to alienate itself from the decision-making process , then it 's quite obvious that there can be a lot which will be decided upon for the union that the uk will disagree with . 
  if you do n't want political integration , fine , but at least try to convince others instead of threatening to abandon the whole project - because the path you 're one just does n't help you in presenting your arguments and is certainly one which the rest of europe ca n't be sympathetic about , it will eventually lead to the uk leaving the eu . 
   i think you vastly overestimate how influential we could be in the eu . 
  if the french can do it , why ca n't you ? 
  i support a lot of the british concerns over the eu , specially with regards to the role of government and how often it should try intervene in the economy but i fully reject the means under which they try to reach those goals which are to constantly try to opt out and to get special provisions often under the threat of veto as opposed to try and get an eu-wide scale deal which would further their goals of freeing the single market and liberalising the economy . 
  `` stability , jobs and growth '' is such an empty thing to say . 
  `` hurr , vote for me if you want nice things ! '', 
   what is wrong with the euro is the germans exercise their decisive influence for the short term german convenience rather than the genuine european interest . 
  what , you think germany should allow inflation to rise drastically so that some countries could get away with not fixing their structural problems ? 
   add a portuguese accent , and every word means `` let us make love '' . 
  you could spend a week in each and still think you missed out on something great . 
   all our efforts in the annexation of mallorca would then be wasted you could still get maiorca . 
  not that you 'd want it so much then , the weather is similar here , the atlantic has much better waves and we have plenty more of space and things to do , but you should never complain for having too much . 
   ^ pickpocket not with all those bystanders everywhere xd just kidding xp, 
   not completely , as there 's a deficit that this tax is designed to help reduce . 
  sure , i 'm aware that it 's not because the french government wants to run a surplus nor anything crazy like that . 
  the issue here seems to be that the french government wants to place a massive and disproportionate burden on the wealthy when these deficits are n't even their doing . 
  they certainly sound more like punishment than fair taxation .
