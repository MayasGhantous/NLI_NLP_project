  while i 'm pretty convinced simonask truly believes the shit he posts , workerpowerftw is an obvious troll . 
   thousands of crimes are committed every day in europe . 
  only the ones having something to do with islam , however inconsequential the connection , seem to get posted to r/europe . 
  we seem obsessed with islam , and it 's a bit pathetic by now . 
  thankfully there 's simonask to clear the name of the good muslims who are against these crimes perpetrated by their brothers and sisters in the faith in the name of allah . 
  though it 's curious that you seem more concerned about the overall opinion of muslims than with their victims and their loved ones . 
   here in portugal it has a slightly different meaning nowadays . 
   tl ; dr : he brought the debt from 60 % gdp to 107 % gdp . 
   also he called for international help and the ran to france with 30 millions in his pocket to take philosophy classes ( ironic right ? 
  ) , classes he stopped going after the first trimester . 
   perhaps you 're the one who should get out .

   the very catholic in rural italy and spain definitely preferred the ancien regime . 
  they were ready to fight for their lives to end french rule it 's not as much that people wanted to give their lives for the monarch or anything but more that the french armies committed several atrocities along the way , [ you ca n't spread the ideals of the enlightenment through the barrel of a gun ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/francisco_de_goya_y_lucientes_-_los_fusilamientos_del_tres_de_mayo_-_1814.jpg ) .

  he certainly was an improvement when compared to the ancien r\u00e9gime , no ? 
  i would n't be so hard on him , this was way back in the 1800s and he seized power in france , you know what they say about how power corrupts . 
  i did n't even know sperm could be taught french .

  it 's not that simple , they were also ideological enemies , the ussr had access to the oil reserves in the caucasus which could greatly benefit germany and stalin was industrializing fast and reforming the military , if germany ever wanted to keep russia in check it had to be then . 
  but then again , both hitler and stalin were insanely radical , trying to make sense of what they did is quite a challenge , millions were slaughtered and for what purpose ? 
  both nazi germany and the ussr collapsed , nobody benefited from that , all that bloodshed was fruitless . 
   hitler looks very uncomfortable in that pic , as if parents are scolding him . 
  he was giving up on the german people in italy which went directly against his principles only to secure an alliance with mussolini . 
  in retrospective , what a dumb move , italy was nothing but a burden to the third reich . 
  but then again , the whole lebensraum thing did n't work out as he intended , perhaps he could have kept his expanded germany if he did n't went against the ussr and told the japanese to not start any shit with the usa . 
  that or perhaps he could have avoided the whole conflict if he told all germans what he told the ones in south tyrol , that they should just move back to germany , that way ww2 and the mass deportations of germans afterwards would have been avoided . 
  portugal is of spanish clay, 
   scoring  you scored 19/50 = 38 % . 
   this beats or equals 30.9 % of test takers . 
   the average score is 30 .

  i got 100 % on europe though , that 's what matters , who cares about non-sovereign states ? 
  he was referring to the location of the new airport . 
  yup , he was a stupid minister , i 'll give you that . 
   i 'll drink to peace , as long as it 's not ` peace for our time ' . 
  i 'll just drink , fucking cheers . 
   and they still have n't returned oliven\u00e7a to us . 
  let them keep that shithole , it 's nothing but an old village filled with pensioners that would be just another expense and left abandoned if it was still portuguese . 
  besides , it 's been under spanish control for some ~ 200 years , why would you want that crap back ? 
   one former minister said `` the south is a desert not worth investing in big infrastructures ( an airport that would serve lisbon ) '' . 
  he was talking about the south margin on the tagus , not the whole south of the country . 
   there is saying around here : `` portugal is lisbon and the rest is landscape . '', 
  our leaders always liked to follow that saying . 
  nope , the saying is `` portugal is the coastline and the rest is landscape '' . 
  which is accurate .

   says the portugese ... 
  it 's portuguese , not portugese , you illiterate fool . 
  was there something wrong with the article ? 
   makes much more sense to focus on english and another foreign language ( mandarin , hindi etc. ) . 
  learning an non indo-european language ? 
  that 's insane . 
  you 're right , but those internal problems ca n't be blamed on the foreign investors , if there 's mismanagement of money and corrupt figures in the country avoid justice , then that 's no excuse to not fulfil the obligations spain agreed with the rest of the europe . 
  saying austerity is to blame and hating on germany because there 's corrupt people in power in spain is outright ludicrous . 
  when people get angry , bad things happen ? 
  you 're telling that to germany ? 
  lol !, 
  suck it up , if you get a loan you have to pay interest , that 's the price of money over time , either you 're too stupid to realise that and nobody should ever again loan to you because you 're not going to pay them back ( and suddenly austerity looks like a breeze when compared to a default and no foreign financing ) or you should deal with your commitments and stop bitching about having to pay your debt like you certainly were n't complaining when you got the loans you now have to pay back .

  paying for sex should be a crime now ? 
  what about when i buy a girl dinner but am only interested in trying my luck later , should this also be illegal ? 
  if no , then does this mean prostitution is ok as long as men pay the whores in dinners instead of in cash ? 
   it 's because you 're a twat . 
  he 's like the most obvious troll ever . 
  i still found this funny though . 
   cap i agree , but why the cfp ? 
  because it 's essentially the same as cap , it 's subsidies that act as trade barriers against foreign countries , it leads to overproduction which then goes to waste , it fails in achieving the goals of providing good remuneration to fishermen and it is highly inefficient , being overall a good example of mismanagement of taxpayers ' money . 
  i 'm not saying we should scrap it , that both cap and cfp should be abolished , but they 're still badly designed policies that need to be changed , i for one would think it would be best if they only acted as regulation to minimize environmental damage and pollution instead of also trying to regulate over prices , the quantity produced and the income of the producers . 
   true , but neither policy is about simply taking over the resources of different countries to further some cynical brussels-based plot ( which i sometimes feel is what many icelanders think ) . 
  rather they are quite simply ... bad policies . 
  exactly . 
  they 're not evil , they 're simply poorly designed . 
  i hate you , you fucking racist piece of shit . 
   also it 's their choice at the end of the day and they 're paying the price for it . 
  this . 
  they 're free to hurt themselves as much as they want . 
   ca n't argue with those arguments i guess [ you were funnier 4 days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/143nqm/european_combat_drone_neuron_makes_its_maiden/c79m3y2?context=3 ) .

   no it was not . 
  the life expectancy in russia has sunk since the fall of moscow and its economic planning . 
  are we talking about gdp or life expectancy ? 
  regardless , if you do n't want financial institutions , free markets and private property , you can always move to country where there 's a stronger emphasis on government control of the economy , common ownership of the capital and an economy for the workers by the workers , i 'm sure you 'd be happier there . 
  are you that workerpowerftw dude ? 
   they could get cheaper food at the cost of losing a lot of their farming sector . 
  that 's not a good trade-off then , if you could get your goods for cheaper , you should do so , there 's no virtue in working more for the same benefit . 
   there is an argument that maintaining a stable , locally sourced food supply is a security issue rather than just a protectionism issue , i.e.
