  a different currency is a barrier for trade , and the argument for having an own currency so that we can devalue to improve trade goes down the drain when that said devaluation has a negative impact on the whole economy ( as everyone 's net worth is negatively affected ) , when changing to a different currency would mean your exports would need to be converted to another currency within the eurozone ( our largest market ) and when you have a lot of products which you need to import no matter what ( so we 'd experience harsh inflation ) . 
  so you ca n't really blame our negative balance of trade on the euro , our largest market also has it and changing the currency away from it would have quite severe impacts to our exports - and you really do n't want to compete on the same level as the east asians . 
   since you 're someone who is against the minimum wage i 'm not , i 'm against our system of minimum wage . 
  i 'm for a minimum wage similar to that of italy , austria , germany , denmark , sweden and norway where is n't not an arbitrary value imposed to everyone equally . 
   you actually appear to be some kind of gold standard supporter which is what the euro pretty much is these days . 
  gold standard ? 
  do n't confuse me with those us libertarians who want to go back in time back to the days before central banks or with the austrians that think that currency should be privately issued . 
  what i 'm for is simply a stable european currency so that there 's less restrictions to trade and so that politicians ca n't get away with constantly devaluing the currency since it 's unpopular for them to increase taxes or cut spending . 
   you seem to only want to see the good things with the euro , when the bad things are now blatantly obvious and the willingness in europe to deal with monetary union problems , from either politicians or their electorates , is quite non existing . 
  which blatantly obvious bad things ? 
  the only one i can think of is that we can no longer devalue it at will , and i do n't really consider it a bad thing . 
   in fact many europeans seem to insist that there is no problem with the emu , the only problem for them are dumb and lazy southerners requiring some protestant education . 
  that stupid and you know it . 
  some retards call us dumb and lazy , other retards say those who refuse to give us more money are nazis , so yeah , there 's retards everywhere , ignore them , they 're not the problem , the problem was our constant public deficits and the delaying in paying them - unfortunately for us , we ca n't just keep delaying the payment of our obligations and expect that people continue to supply us the cheap money . 
   i would love for us to be in a fiscal union , i 'd love for us to have a functioning central bank like the us , i 'd love europeans to be glad to support one another , i 'd love world peace . 
  sadly none of these things appear to be happening any time soon . 
  yup , i agree with all of this . 
  however , just because these do n't seem they will happen any time soon , we should n't backtrack and scrap that which we 've already achieved . 
  trying to bring down the partial monetary union because there 's still no full monetary and fiscal union , i personally find that counter-productive . 
  til there are people incarcerated in portugal . 
  i was under the impression everybody walked free here . 
  portugal here , thank fuck for the euro , it has saved us from what happened in the past where all debts were paid by devaluing the currency ever further instead of addressing the issues . 
  it 's also much easier to export to the rest of europe , to import goods like fuel and to prevent interest rates of being even higher , so yeah , the $ uro could have been implemented better but it has been great for us so far . 
   siesta is a spanish thing , not portuguese . 
  i really ca n't blame the spanish for the siesta considering their days are huge , their timezone being the same as sweden and poland has these effects . 
  though better than siesta is [ fiesta ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz4gd_u98ok ) !, 
   ent\u00e3o , my adopted countrymen , can someone please tell this immigrant who i am supposed to be cheering for now that portugal 's out ? 
  surely not the muchachos across the border , right ? 
    as a north american female , eurovision is like my world cup . 
  spain is fine too .

   what purpose does it serve to turn every single comment section in this subreddit into a uk-europe brawl ? 
    i think there 's enough of that as it is .

   the recent developments in the country allowing for sms-tracking of your wife is just one of many proactive initiatives that in the long run will improve standard of living in saudi arabia significantly .

   scary sweden 's governments experiments with children in kindergardens finaly begin to give results . 
  thats what happens when you keep brainwashing innocent children with `` race and gender is just a social construct '' bullshit , all the time . 
  i 'm pretty sure weeaboos come from 4chan , not from the swedish bureaucracy . 
   strong military is good for maintaining western dominance of the world , which is absolutely an imperative for the ** previous centuries ** . 
  there , ftfy , the time of european military domination is dead and long gone , we wo n't control anyone else with the barrel of a gun when nuclear weapons are easily available . 
  we hardly have a military and we matter immensely , our economy is stronger than that of the usa , and i think this is a great thing , we work in our self-interest and also benefit others instead of alienating the rest of the world . 
  you can call me deluded but i think that we are much stronger if we can get others to help us because it would be in their interest as they 'd also benefit economically than we would be if we just threatened with violence like drone strikes and such . 
  so yeah , between investing in the military at the expense of the economy or letting the economy grow freely and cut spending in the military , i 'd rather that we just kept our military to the minimum and focused all our efforts in the economy . 
   i do n't favour argentina . 
  but the island is in south america , it would belong to either brazil or argentina . 
  what 's next , bermuda belongs to the usa ? 
  french polynesia belongs to indonesia ? 
  madeira belongs to morocco ? 
   there are also countries -- such as portugal , south africa , finland , the netherlands , and the republic of macedonia -- that have proportional representation systems without a threshold what 's that threshold for ?

  we must make choices , one ca n't just ask for the world , i 'd rather not tax people so high so that the economy benefited instead of taxing them and building a military base so that the military benefited . 
  besides , if you want to promote peace , an arms race is n't the way to go , the eu itself is proof that it 's much better to simply liberalise and free the markets so that the economies become interconnected and that a conflict is against the best interests of all parties involved - and there 's also the benefit that stronger economies benefits our societies while stronger armies are only good for killing those who oppose the powers that be . 
   to maintain global military dominance ? 
  that 's been proven to not be effective . 
  if anything , we should strive for global economic dominance , now that would be swell . 
   he 's an eu citizen . 
  this . 
  the thing about promoting equity through welfare is that it also leads to inefficiency , a basic income guarantee would be great if you wanted a system that promoted people living off the work of others - while i would n't think of moving to germany only to live on welfare , i 'm sure some people would and now is not really the time to place another burden on the economy , we have enough problems as is with our public sector debt . 
   it 's only insane if you do n't understand it . 
  it 's also insanely unaffordable and it also promotes unemployment which is insane . 
   it 's probably true that people on this subreddit share a great deal more with each other than with their compatriots . 
  we 're all losers , too . 
   a basic income guarantee great , give me that so that i can move to germany and live on welfare . 
  why do we need nato anyway ? 
   funny picture , upvote for you .

  because holland is a part of the netherlands , there are 13 provinces and noord holland and zuid holland ( north and south , obviously ) are just two of them . 
  instead of getting upset , you should be more understanding , it 's a figure of speech that simplifies things and that does n't carry any political connotation with it , it 's nothing more than a [ synecdoche ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pars_pro_toto ) . 
   `` aryans of the east '' , as adolf hitler said . 
  quoting hitler ? 
  loooool if you really want to troll people into believing you 're a racist , at least do n't quote a two-faced black-haired midget who betrayed the germans in switzerland and south tyrol xd [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/osdye.jpg ) , i find this pic somewhat appropriate, 
   it 's somewhat like calling all of britain or the uk `` england '' . 
  i 'm aware of that but it makes things simpler . 
  sure , on reddit i also write `` the netherlands '' or `` united kingdom '' but when i talk normally i say `` holland / holanda '' or `` england / inglaterra '' just because it 's much easier and because , unlike what happens in reddit , nobody gets upset or attempts to correct me . 
   whites are still master race for me . 
  what about japs ? 
  why not holland ? 
  that 's not up for sale , sorry . 
   a ** portuguese ** ftfy . 
   fuck you for even implying this thing is even remotely democratic or even remotely involves the citizens  fuck you lol, 
  you have good taste in music , 
   because every other year is the year of the elites damn reddit , why do you have to be like that ? 
  do you people really expect to be taken seriously when you throw around the word `` elites '' at the slightest thing ? 
  not good enough but doable . 
  i do agree with cameron 's proposals of cutting the eu budget and i 'd even go farther , cap and the strasbourg parliament need to go as they 're too expensive , though it 's quite obvious that france will veto anything of the sort , so the next best thing would be to make cap optional so that member-states could opt out and make france alone the one to pay for the strasbourg parliament ( again , this is much easier said than done but it would be beneficial on the long run for europe ) . 
  regardless of this , i do hope that britain wo n't alienate itself more from the eu , they ca n't continue to just opt out or veto , going in the reverse direction of the rest of europe , these issues must be well discussed and a democratic outcome reached , not the usual `` either do what we want or do whatever and leave us out of it '' the uk seems to be doing .
