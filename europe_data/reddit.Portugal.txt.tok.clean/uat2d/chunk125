  it looks awful , use the civil ensign i posted as [ it can also be used ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_switzerland ) and that way the flair can be like the others and not a 11x11 square . 
  there are [ odder flags ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nepalese_flag ) but in this type of things , for the sake of simplicity and streamlining things , it 's ok to make them like the others . 
  for the love of everything that is holy , fix the [ swiss flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:civil_ensign_of_switzerland_%28pantone%29.svg ) , their flag is n't white on the sides . 
  i just made [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o77l7.png ) in paint , it may not be great but at least it 's not white on the sides or a square . 
  nope , [ it 's not because long usernames ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j7qkf.png ) ( firefox ) . 
   as you can see , it was going nicely until 2008 , when it was at 20 % , then it started to go up . 
  the debt of the country has doubled since 2008 and it does n't seem to change anytime soon . 
  sure , maybe now it 's `` only 50 % '' , but with the current trend it will be 70 % in 2016 and 100 % in 2020 . 
  holy shit , you 're like [ portugal a decade ago ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
   i was talking about the whole package , not just the geography/climate talking about the whole package , europe can be very shitty as well . 
   problem solved , if you look white you 're white by me , i 'm certainly not going to bother checking your family tree to see if jamal is in it xp [ you ca n't blame skin colour for everything ] ( http://ainanas.com/must-see/video-chocante-rapariga-espancada-por-duas/ ),

   spend less time on / pol / . 
  i 'll take that as an insult . 
  fuck you , i do n't . 
   africa can be a nice place , it just is n't as nice as here  africa not nicer than europe ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  what , you enjoy the rain and the cold ? 
  i 'm not asking for malaria or dysentery nor am i asking for the saharan desert or for the congolese jungle , but with regards to geography and the climate , africa is much more appealing than europe . 
   you 're not the only one who had family in the overseas , my father/grandparents/uncles / etc. . were there and had to come back with nothing like everyone else . 
  and nowadays i still have family in africa . 
  ahah , you hate your family and do n't want them to come back xd  why would i ? 
  you would still be portuguese culturally/genetically ... 
  the fuck kinda of question is that ? 
  do you think i hate people born in africa ? 
  xd what if i am of african descent ? 
  i mean , i find that very dubious because , well , you know , i 'm white . . besides , my grandparents were all born in portugal . . but you never know , their grandparents or the grandparents of my grandparents , some of them might have fucked a moroccan or a native american or a sub-saharan and , as time goes on , the differences fade away . . how can you tell considering our history goes back for centuries and you have no records ? 
  oh , and yeah , i might be culturally portuguese ( or portista/portuense , that might be more accurate ) but i 've ( involuntarily and against my own will ) listen to a lot of african music because that bit of african culture did stick with my father and i still have to listen to `` amigo do meu amigo , meu amigo \u00e9 '' or `` sab\u00e3o cr\u00e1cr\u00e1 '' or some other bullshit african music which will fucking drive you insane if you have to listen it for hours when in long car trips . 
  but that 's another thing , that probably only makes me hate more their culture than appreciate it . 
  what what ? 
  the chick in the video being found murdered part or the i could have been born in africa bit ? 
  i 'll assume it 's the girl thingie and yeah , the chick in the video being found murdered was on the news some time ago . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the chick having sex with a black guy is doing that to the anthem of sweden and was then found dead and sexually abused in some woods , there was no need for you to post it . . do n't be like that tugasnake , africa can be a nice place , do n't hate them . . 
  i 'd myself probably be african-born like my parents if it was n't for the end of the regime , you would n't hate on me if i was born and raised in angola instead of in mainland portugal , would you ?

   it 's like make something illegal after everyone committed this while it was still legal and demand to punish those people . 
  besides you can not just say to millions of people `` ok it was fun , now gtfo '' . 
  by that logic , citizens from hong kong or macau have eu citizenship . 
  and they do n't . 
   i 'd rather my country did n't go the way of the roman empire quite so soon , but thanks all the same . 
  the empire already collapsed . 
   sometimes you have to take one for the team . 
  while you 're absolutely right , we do also have some responsibility - the eu 's goals should be clearer , its priorities more straight and its democratic values held to a higher standard - we ca n't just say it 's the uk 's fault and that their being selfish , you know , we should be all for the eu but the eu should also be for all of us ( like in the three musketeers :p ) . 
   as far as i know it produces shitton of laws that actually restrict markets , am i wrong ? 
  national governments also do that and , at least with the eu , there are no tariffs . 
  also , the common currency is a big plus for freedom of trade . 
   because it 's a liberal circlejerk which rejects and ridicules , instead of respects , old values that a large proportion of the population still adheres to . 
  are you talking about the eu or about reddit ? 
  if they want to leave , let them , it 's the only possible democratic outcome , we ca n't keep them in the eu against their own will . 
  besides , if they do leave , it will be their loss , why should we bother for them ?

   the world , can not have a trade surplus . 
  yet , officially , it does .

  [ video of the police charge ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75qsp-ungju ) [ another video of the events ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=603511&amp;tm=8&amp;layout=122&amp;visual=61 ) the policemen were being thrown rocks and other objects for over an hour and half , there were already several civilians injured but that could n't receive medical care because the protesters were n't allowing the ambulances to reach the site , the police gave twice the order of dispersion and only later did they removed everyone from the premises forcefully . 
  the police , the members of government , the labour unions and the opposition parties , they all condemned the violence and distanced themselves from these protesters which were for hours inciting violence , this was n't part of the general strike but rather a mob rioting and the police dealing with them . 
   it 's almost as if you think that greece , portugal , and spain have benefited from the euro , and are not in a depression because of it . 
  portugal 's issue was never the $ uro but rather the public debt . 
  spain was the housing bubble . 
  greece was the massive public debt , the lack of competitiveness and the situation blowing up on everyone 's faces because they were cooking the books . 
  so no , the $ uro is n't to blame , in fact , we have benefited from it as it 's easier to export within the eurozone and it 's cheaper to import from abroad that which we do n't or ca n't produce . 
  blaming the crisis on it is simply wrong . 
  yeah , you 're right , the rest of the eu bailing us out would be easy but we 've already received plenty of eu funding , most of it was used inefficiently . 
  besides , it would be very demanding , entitled and irresponsible of us to demand bailouts from others . 
  also , it 's only fair that we follow the same guidelines , we all have the same responsibilities regardless of the size of our economies . 
  while the eu is an union and not a confederation or a federation , no , i do n't think we have the right to complain about austerity and unfair treatment , we are where we are because of our government 's fault and not in a position to unilaterally demand support from other countries within our union . 
  yet you seem supportive of his ideology , going against austerity with a ~ 110 % debt to gdp ratio . 
   it 's a gross oversimplification exactly . 
   it is one of the causes of the crisis . 
  i repeat , one of the causes , not the only one or the most important . 
  you 're right , it 's a cause , but in portugal , the trade balance is hardly relevant to the problems we 're facing . . we could even be importing more and exporting less and be austerity-free had n't we more than doubled our public debt these past few years . 
  someone from / int / going layman about this and reddit upvoting this even though it 's not factual is a mistake . 
  it 's a public debt crisis , not a trade imbalance crisis . 
  it 's the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
   euro debt crisis  implying it was caused by germany 's trade surplus and not by some governments ' mismanagement of public funds  blaming germany for being competitive and having a positive trade balance [ areyouleserious.jpg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjown.png ), 
   austerity reduces consumption , reduced consumption reduces revenues , reduced revenues reduce government revenues , ** if government revenues decrease at a higher rate than the deficit then austerity is increasing the deficit ** also , taxes required for the public spending in the first place reduce consumption , reduced consumption yada yada yada , ** if government taxes increase at a slower rate than the benefit for society of the spending later then austerity would reduce the deficit **, 
  s\u00f3crates socialist economics ^ tm saying we should n't care about costs , that the more something costed , the better , because it would create more employment and growth - 2005/2011 ( he actually said this when referring to the tgv ), 
   you can finance a stimulus in several ways , debt , printing money , selling of government assets , foreign aid , etc our debt is already over 100 % our gdp , printing money is ( thankfully ) impossible because of the $ uro , selling of government assets is already being done , foreign aid is best left for starving countries , etc. 
   inflation is pretty damn low in the eu which is great , considering how is essentially destroys savings and acts like a tax on all money where everyone 's possessions devalue . 
   so that they can devalue and become competitive .
