  so that we can no longer afford fuel ? 
  so that food becomes much more expensive ? 
  so that medicine turns into an even greater expense ? 
   but you 're competing at similar wage levels with countries with much better products . 
  similar wage levels ? 
  is the rest of the eurozone paid on average 950 $ / month ? 
  much better products ? 
  how do you even compare portuguese exports with french or finnish exports when we do n't even sell the same products ? 
   no i 'm in england , like a lot of europe we still have a functioning aristocracy but of course the real autocrats are the billionaire capitalist class , you can see many of these in the tory party ; they 're not hard to miss ; look for the ones in eton or harrow ties ... we do n't have any of those here , sorry . 
   closing the very institutions which might give us a chance to adapt to the new world is an absurd notion what institutions ? 
   you 'd throw away all the benefits of the education and health systems throw away education and healthcare ? 
  what the heck are you talking about ? 
  austerity means cutting excessive public spending , not cutting all public spending . 
  useless subsidies , state-owned companies , public infrastructure built without any demand for them , this needs to be slashed . 
  healthcare and education , these are core areas and nobody is interested in reducing the services provided by these . 
   take away everything people have worked hard to establish and you wo n't find yourself in a magical world of moral decency and eternal wealth what have we worked hard to establish ? 
  football stadiums without people to play football in ? 
  airports which never had schedules flights ? 
  roads where there 's an average of 2 cars per hour during daytime ? 
  is this what you 're defending ? 
   you 'll find yourself back in the pre-industrial dark ages which people worked so hard to claw us out of . 
  these metaphors are worse than the black plague . 
   people that are rallying against austerity are n't proposing tax increases they 're not proposing , of course , but how will they afford the spending then ? 
  they either tax people or they cut spending elsewhere or they print money - considering we ca n't print money ( and even if we could , that would lead to inflation ) and that they say they 're against the spending cuts , it leaves them no choice but to increase taxes in order to afford the spending they so want to increase/maintain . 
   get out of the euro , get back to competitiveness . 
  does not compute . 
   you 're never going to grow your way out of debt without exporting . 
  fortunately with the euro , it 's easier for us to export for our largest market , the eurozone . 
   we could try establishing an economy based on sustainability and stability ; support solutions which allow people to live well and communities to grow great , so austerity to make our economies more sustainable and stable and less dependent on public funding . 
   rather than simply benefiting an autocratic elite ... autocratic elites , really ? 
  and whom are these evil elites that are benefit from the current state of affairs and that are exploiting the rest of us ? 
   in my mind giving up on progress which progress are we giving up on ? 
   reverting to a new dark ages first you talk about autocratic elites , now you mention we 're reverting to a new dark ages . . are you in saudi arabia or in north korea or something ? 
  how do you have an web connection there ? 
   what exactly is austerity ? 
  i 've read it 's spending cuts and tax increases but the exact details are never given in the us news . 
  what exactly is happening ? 
  austerity simply means to cut excessive public spending . 
  tax increases are not austerity because while they do balance the public budget by increasing its revenues , they do not reduce public spending . 
  some examples of austerity are cutting back on public worker 's wages , laying off state-workers , reducing social benefits , reducing subsidies to certain sector of the economy or providing less public goods . 
   what 's not masochistic about having everything cut and the average quality of life dropped significantly ? 
  austerity simply means to live within our means , if some welfare needs to be cut , then that welfare is n't something we should have had in the first place , it must be cut now before the debt associated to it does any more damage . 
  it 's obvious not popular specially among the people that benefit more from state funding but it 's simply unsustainable for us to keep living the good life without money to afford it and leave the debt for future generations . 
  in our case , in january 2002 , portugal had a debt to gdp ratio of 51.2 % , this january , it was of 108.1 % . 
  this is the main problem , this is what 's driving the interest rates up and requiring us to cut down on the spending , this is why austerity is required , because it 's masochistic to continue to allow the debt to grow even larger and because it 's this runaway spending that 's now dropping the average life quality and that will drop the average life quality even more on the long run . 
  alcohol , tobacco and cannabis . 
  `` hurr durr , we 're in recession because of austerity and not because of excessive public spending , the state needs to increase taxes so it can afford more spending and so we can finally break the economic cycle and experiment permanent expansion '' damn austerity haters , you must be all masochists . 
   [ according to the 2011 census , 91.4 % of the portuguese population are roman catholic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal#religion ) . 
   [ an abortion referendum took place in portugal on february 11 , 2007 , to decide whether to legalise abortion up to ten weeks . 
  official results of the referendum showed that 59.24 % of the portuguese approved the proposal put on ballot , while 40.76 % rejected it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_abortion_referendum,_2007 ) . 
  i fail to see the correlation . 
   do we ? 
  drop words like `` austerity '' here and prepare for the shitstorm to start again . 
  that also happens inside our own society , it 's not like all portuguese agree with it but germans disagree with it , no , some agree and some disagree with it regardless of their country . 
   not to mention that redditors are all effectively the same socioeconomic group : left-leaning young people , overwhelmingly male , potentially just in university or in their first job . 
  of course we agree on things  yup , the demographics here are similar , but again , people in their 50s here are n't any different from people in their 50s there . 
   i remember well when europe broke the last time the us came , and suddenly we were `` old europe '' and `` new europe '' ... ? 
   only the eu has not exactly a stellar track record when it comes to democracy ( either , the people are asked not at all , or they are asked as often as it takes to get them to agree . ), 
  that 's why it needs to be done better . . referendums would be nice . 
  just like the dozen assholes that were comparing merkel with hitler got her to listen to them . 
  in fact , you should apply for membership in [ pctp-mrpp ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=pt-pt&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flutapopularonline.org%2f ) , [ they clearly agree with you ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=pt-pt&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flutapopularonline.org%2findex.php%2fpais%2f104-politica-geral%2f468-a-repressao-fascista-da-policia-de-choque-faz-dezenas-de-feridos-entre-grevistas-que-se-concentraram-em-s-bento-militantes-do-partido-entre-o-alvo-da-brutalidade-policial ) . 
   obviously i do n't support rioting , but thinking it will go away by just arresting a few hooligans , a scenario your hypothesis seems to support , when the reasons for the riot are ever increasing , seems very optimistic to me . 
    there will always be people , maybe not as smart as you and i , that see no way out ; they will riot while that is the case . 
  you 're right , it 's not about ending with rioters , it 's about minimizing the damages they cause . 
  and that 's why the police action was required . 
  but this is unrelated to the point i was trying to make in the first post which was that the footage shown on the bbc is n't about `` protests of austerity '' but just `` protests '' . 
   ( much closer shared than - say - a finnish person shares with a portug ** u ** ese one ) they still have different languages and the cantons do n't mix like that , i have friends and colleagues who were born and lived there some years and they tell me things are very different among the country . 
  and with regards to your example , jrohila is finnish , i 'm portuguese , and here on reddit , we seem to get along great . 
  :p  the eu lacks such an outside threat , and it lacks the shared culture . 
  we 're under the threat of wasting resources competing against each other and standing no chances against the other superpowers . 
  as for the culture , we all seem to share similar values here in r/europe . 
   the people have a strong connection to their nature as `` schweizervolk '' ( whereas most europeans see themselves as polish , german , french , spanish etc first ) true that , but then again , once an american comes around as talks shit , oh boy , suddenly we 're all europeans , suddenly those who are badmouthing us get destroyed . 
   in short : i do n't see it happening . 
  in short : i also do n't see it happening on the short-term . 
  on the long-run , if things are done properly and in the most democratic way possible , it 's quite feasible and it would be a much better alternative than the way things are now . 
  they 're loose enough and the principle of subsidiarity is applied . 
  could n't it work with the eu as well ? 
  how about a confederation like the swiss ? 
  hey , i 'm a gypsy , do n't say that , it 's discrimination . . where do i apply for welfare ? 
  just a couple of posts back you said the eu would n't survive and now you say a federal europe would be fine after a while . 
  i do n't get it , are you saying that the looser the commitment ( be it an union , a confederation or a federation ) , the worst the chances of it going not according to planned ? 
   i would n't call them `` anarchists '' though , since they really have no philosophy , and i do n't think we have `` anarchists '' here anyway , a more accurate term would be `` disenfranchised youth '' . 
    this is sadly all to be expected , as people grow more and more desperate , and see no light at the end of the tunnel , some of them are going to do stupid things . 
  associating those rioters with the policies that are being implemented is similar to associating football hooligans or drunk youths with those same policies , their behaviour is the same and they 're just as correlated . 
  those anarchists / guy fawkes wannabes / disenfranchised youths / whatever you want to call them , they were harassing bystanders , throwing rocks at the police , not allowing the ambulances to pick up the injured even long before the police charged and overall were rioting and breaking the law . 
  what happened here was nothing like the toronto riots or the england riots but it was comparable to those in that while no part did best , you ca n't put the blame on the authorities for the damage during the riots and the aftermath . 
  so a federal europe would be fine just like federal germany is ? 
   well , ai n't that a surprise . 
  so what are we protecting them from ? 
  claiming personal responsibility for their livelihood ? 
  we 're protecting them against those who demand equality of treatment and want everybody to live under the same rules and laws . 
  doctomoe , those same arguments can be used against the federal republic of germany and so far , germany is doing fine . .

  as you can see , the footage shown on bbc has nothing to do with `` workers in austerity protests '' , a better title would be `` anarchists throw rocks at police for over 1h30 , fail to comply to the order of dispersion and then are cleared by the officers '' though i guess asking for proper journalism is too much these days . 
  portuguese workers on a general strike ?
