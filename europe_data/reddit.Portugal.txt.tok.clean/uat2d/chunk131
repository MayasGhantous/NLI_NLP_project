   or perhaps i 'm , as opposed to you , just a rational human being capable of seeing that the world is n't ** black & white ** . 
  black and white ? 
  why did you capitalize white and not black ? 
  you racist bastard !, 
   your new attitude with links to every post is a bit annoying . 
  and often it does n't even make sense ( or i just do n't get it ) . 
  what new attitude ? 
  i just opened his comment history and it was there . 
  it 's so that people do n't tell me i 'm saying it to offend anyone , it 's something he himself said . 
  ( or maybe not !, 
   words do not mean what they meant years ago . 
  if you can get away with it , so can i. faggot ( it means `` nice fellow '' , here , look at the [ edited wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faggot ) ) . 
   yeah you definitely have n't been paying attention ...   that said : reported for homophobic discriminatory language . 
  firstly , you 're just giving me reason . 
  secondly , nobody cares if you bitched to the mods . 
  if you feel offended , go choke on a dick , see if i care . 
   `` homophobia '' does not mean `` fearful of gays '' . 
  `` homo '' means `` homosexual '' and `` phobia '' means `` fear '' . 
   etymological arguments are not valid arguments . 
  says who ? 
   but referring to someone as `` a sissy '' sure sounds homophobic . 
  perhaps in your view , yes , but then again , you see everything through persecution tinted lens . 
  it seems every time you post here , you 're crying discrimination , it 's actually quite pathetic . 
  do n't be a sissy , you [ faggot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jew7l.jpg ) . 
  take your memes and leave them in the american part of reddit . 
  thanks in advance . 
   i think special thanks are due to the members of #europe on snoonet.com for demonstrating this . 
  sup guys ?? 
   it did n't even occur to you that i might be gay . 
  [ simonask is gay as well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12sw8g/reurope_poll_results/c6y82yr ) . 
  now kiss . 
   there are always 2 sides to a coin . 
  just keep the kids away from him !, 
   i do n't have so much time [ you lie !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgce06yw2ro ), 
   it was part of a monologue , it was n't meant to be historically accurate . 
  and it 's a pretty funny monologue ... 
  the ' [ religion is bullshit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=messwkffj9o ) ' is quite funny and is also accurate . 
   homosexuals , being harsh supporters of `` diverse '' and multicultural societies , having taste of their own double edged sword . 
  [ even a one edged sword is a double edged sword .

   who are the people who are trying to `` fuck with us '' ? 
  people who shout `` by the quran , we will kill you all , you faggots ! '', 
  before attacking a gay bar ? 
   i 'm asking because you used strongly homophobic language homophobic language ? 
  where is his post was eryemil anti or fearful of gays ? 
   as your compatriot george carlin once said , columbus discovered america because he wanted nothing to do with these nuts . 
  yet he had no problems in slaughtering the natives in found in the name of god , gold and the queen . 
   german ** genetic ** aggression instinct you sound like an anti-german fascist . 
   the uk , post-rebate , pays less to the eu than it does to wales , and well under half than it does to scotland . 
  wow . . is this for real ? 
  because if it is , if an english used the fact that the uk is a net contributor as an argument against the eu , that argument would be even more valid as an argument against the uk because england is a net contributor of wales , scotland and ( i presume ) northern ireland . 
   i 'm a bit concerned about having military and intelligence at that level , because those are the national duties which have the strongest symbolism , and which are simultaneously the most dangerous when undermined , and the most vulnerable to being undermined . 
  america is a very clear-cut example of the way in which these organizations can overwhelm the structures around them . 
  whatever you think about the confederate position in the civil war , it is nevertheless astonishing that american states are not free to secede from the union . 
  and there seems to be a never-ending succession of cia and fbi intrigues rolling around . 
    i think you can find a compromise there . 
  i would have a nato-esque cooperation of national militaries rather than a single european military , which meant that national symbolism was maintained , and that militaries were free to act independently . 
  i would have a strong internal investigatory capability , especially for fraud and corruption , but probably keep external intelligence more or less at a national level . 
  in terms of whether britain could be sold on this , it might well be difficult seeing as we have a perception that we still have a strong global role , the old post-imperial line . 
  i think it would depend on how the symbolism of it was presented . 
  i 'm aware of these difficulties , it 's obviously not something that can be changed or made appealing to everyone overnight , i just think that on the long run , it would benefit us all more if we defined better the role of the eu and made a distinction between what should be universal ( like defending freedom , liberty and democracy ; protecting eu citizens against foreign threats ; ensuring free trade within the single market ; etc ) and what could be done on an european level but would n't the role of the eu and therefore would be optional ( erasmus programme , cap , cfp , etc ) . 
  but , of course , there 's difficulties like you mentioned , another example would be the foreign relations bit where a lot of countries would need to compromise a lot to not lose from the change ( portugal or the uk and their relations with the former colonies , france and its permanent seat on the un security council , etc ) , so , again , not an easy change but more beneficial for europe on a long run if it could be implemented , imo . 
   the teachers repeat non stop : `` there are only 3 * salidas * ^ 1 for you : by air , by land or by sea . 
  you better start preparing your luggagge '' . 
    1 ) salidas , besides exit can also mean job oportunity . 
  ahaha , that also works here , i was never told anything like that but it would be funny if someone said : `` voc\u00eas s\u00f3 t\u00eam tr\u00eas sa\u00eddas : por terra , mar e ar . '', 
   in the long run we 're all dead no need to rush it , though . 
   the solution to europes problems is to go back to a free trade union , the only people that would benifit from a federal europe are the politicians , most citizens do better with smaller governments how about a confederation where matters like defence , external intelligence , interstate security , foreign relations , the single market and the single currency are dealt with on an european level , and everything else was left to the national or local levels of government ? 
  a confederation whose only powers other than those i just mentioned were only to propose to the member-states something but it was up to them to implement them or not ? 
  in essence , it would be a looser and grander version of [ this ] ( http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/c101.html ) . 
   the uk could do just fine trading with the whole world as well as europe as the other 6.5 billion other people across the planet not living in europe do . 
  i 'm sure she was n't implying that you need the eu to trade with anyone but rather that with the eu you can much more easily trade with your largest market which is europe . 
   europeans need to stop thinking of us as european , because we certainly do n't . 
  you live in an island 30km of the coast of france and you say you 're not european ? 
  lol, 
   a norwegian wrote in english on an american website . 
  did you know these issues are also discussed on other websites and in other languages ? 
  who cares about christmas anyway ? 
   but yeah , we should help them out , and eventually try to expand to the east , with the ultimate goal of integrating russia into a massive economic ( and energy ) powerhouse . 
  i do n't think our ultimate goal should ever be of integrating russia but rather for us to become so good and efficient that even norway and switzerland apply . 
   uat2d does n't really read articles , they just comment on them without thinking . 
  guilty !, 
   yeah ... so / r/europe is basically / r/anglosaxons . 
  if i was polish , i 'd now be buying russian gas at a discount and selling it in the single market for a profit . 
   there is a reason we are more known for our vodka than our wine . 
  i 've heard that grapes want warmth , sun and it to be pretty dry . 
  not exactly our strengths . 
  sigh ... . vodka is pretty nice too . 
  do excuse my illiteracy in beverages , but i 've had some times now black vodka with coca-cola ( yep , i 'm still just a kid and have n't tried much other than this vodka ) and it 's indeed great . 
  the last time i went out at night , it was a party where we had these coupons for free vodka and i do remember getting three of my lady friends to give me their coupons ( they were sober the whole night and left early , ah ! ), 
  and the drinks were wonderful . 
  i was also pretty thirsty and quite inebriated at the time , but it was n't only that , they were indeed good drinks !, 
  :p  one can tell why the french want to keep the cap though . 
  seriously , they get paid for growing wine . 
  i have to admit their shamelessness though . 
  `` cap is needed in case of food shortage '' `` cap is needed for the little farmer '' etc. 
  and then they spend 2 % of the whole budget on wine . 
  yup . 
  it 's up for us to tell them to suck it up and to subsidise their agriculture themselves if they want it .
