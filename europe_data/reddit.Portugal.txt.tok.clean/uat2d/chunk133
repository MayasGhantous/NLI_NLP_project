   maybe you should direct your hatred somewhere else ... i suggest reading ... 
  it will be better for your narrow minded view of the world ... and maybe , just maybe you will found out that , no one is stealing nothing from no one ... and that macedonia is just one small country who is trying to find it 's way among the european family ... 
  so far ... greece has complained about her name and history , bulgaria complains about her identity and history , serbia complains about it 's church , language and history ( do you notice any pattern around here ) , albania complains about it 's territory ... macedonia is negated from everyone of it 's neighbours . 
  do you really believe that we are the only one insane around here ??? 
  do you ??? 
  while balkan nationalists are lovely to mock [ ( and i 've done this in the past ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/chv0f.png ) , i must ask you something , why do you guys never write in proper english ? 
  nations are 19th century invention , thus every modern nation predates its past historic heroes and their ethnicity . 
    i do n't believe in the sanctity of `` nations '' . 
  they are just administrative borders , who gives a fuck ? 
  nice try , fyromian . 
  i hereby reclaim that piece of land you call a nation to rome . 
  i agree with cameron 's attempts to cut spending also on an european level and he was elected and also has the right to make that call . 
   but france 's historical role in the eu is deserving of some sort of physical recognition . 
  with their attitude , what they deserve is to suck it up and deal with it . 
  alternatively , all the expenses of the strasbourg parliament should come out of their pocket . 
   belgium , in the fucking middle of military superpowers since 500 ad . 
  i 'm not want to be that guy but i 'll be that guy . 
  only [ in 1830 belgium declared independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_independence ) and only [ in 1839 it was recognized by the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_london,_1839 ) . 
  so if a british soldier is in a [ british air base in cyprus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raf_akrotiri ) ( [ which is technically british soil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ) ) goes to limassol to buy a six-pack , the uk 's technically invading cyprus ? 
  yup , by that definition , when all the european leaders and their bodyguards meet in brussels , belgium is being invaded simultaneously by everybody !, 
  i 'm guessing they 're using the ` logic ' similar to ` since the uk has once been at war with russia , we 've tried to invade nowadays kazakhstan ' . 
  yup , quite silly . 
  or portugal . 
   most farmers go out of business if they 're not competitive , let them , they 'll no longer be a burden to the taxpayer . 
  lol , `` most farmers '' . . did you know that agriculture has always been profitable even without any government subsidies ? 
   rural towns get fucked up yes , cap is what 's saving us from the collapse of rural society . 
  lololol  a huge surge of unemployment in the cities if cap is good in promoting employment , why should n't we go further with inefficient government planning to promote even more employment ? 
  i suggest we all ban windows so that sunlight ca n't get in . 
  think of the employment that we 'd create in the light-bulb and power industry !, 
   we fuck up the environment you do n't need massive subsidies to enforce environmental regulation . 
   trying to keep the landscape broadly pristine again , not at all cap related . 
   ok , gotcha , great plan genius . 
  certainly a better plan than `` the government should run everything otherwise we 're fucked '' , genius . 
   there 's nothing else really that 's able to be cut . 
  other than everything , yeah , there 's not much to cut . 
   on behalf of the uk , i 'm so sorry about david cameron . 
  i voted liberal democrat so i feel partially responsible . 
  if i had know i would have voted green or something . 
  on behalf of myself , nobody resents the uk for anything and specially nobody cares in whom you voted for . 
   the farm subsidies are there so that if there 's a bad harvest in other food exporting countries , we do n't starve . 
  yeah , because we still did n't invent the technology like refrigeration which allows for long term preservation of agricultural products . 
   it 's a self preservation program . 
  too bad it has only created massive surpluses than then went to waste . 
  not only is it highly inefficient , it has never served its purpose . 
  nobody will starve , all the arable land in the world will not suddenly turn to sand , we have the technology to provide food for everyone and still have leftovers . 
  cap is n't anything like that , it 's simply protectionism and the result of the french farmer lobby . 
   canada is 40 times bigger than britain and has 1/2 its population . 
   that 's exactly what german headhunters are doing in hungary . 
  [ fucking karmawhores ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2w4x2qaoiq ) !, 
  hearts of iron 3, 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) 's the view that i identify myself the most with . 
  i mean , it 's not only that , i also think that healthcare and education should also be paid for by the state to ensure equality of opportunities to everyone regardless of their background but i would n't call myself [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ) because i 'm fully aware that , for the most part , welfare is inefficient ( as it requires massive state funding ) , promotes inefficiency ( as there is n't such a need to work hard if everything can be provided by the others ) and is unsustainable on the long run ( as it has a natural tendency of being expanded past what society can afford ) . 
  i think it 's rather pointless to show this to you if you so strong on the ` no property , everything is shared ' communist thingie but who knows , perhaps one day you 'll come to realize that communism is , just like religion , nothing but a dream and an illusion ( another opium of the masses ) , that it 's part of human nature to desire for power and that the best way to prevent oppression and tyranny is not by putting the people who call themselves the most considerate ( the communists ) in power but rather by keeping a balance of power where the power is in the hands of the people and where everyone has the same rights and duties . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_t0wf-ucwg ) , friedman will certainly explain this much better than i ever could . 
   it makes outside goods more expensive and so helps to close trade imbalances , it makes it more viable to produce and consume goods locally you say it like it 's a good thing . 
  it 's not , it 's protectionism , it only harms the consumer ( as they see their prices increase massively - you tell to a greek the best way to solve their problems is with an at least 50 % / year inflation rate ) , promotes inefficiency in the national market ( as the producers are shielded from the outside ) and it drives the prices of everything else through the roof ( the fact that greece has relatively small arable land and is n't self-sufficient on agriculture and also does n't own any oil would mean that even basic goods such as food and fuel would be prone to critical shortages - the whole economy would pay dearly if the power supply was endangered , not to mention what could happen if food suddenly became unaffordable ) . 
   and typically after a devaluation the situation stabilises and things get better , which is a damned site better alternative to the current never ending disaster . 
  metaphorically speaking , this would be the same as refusing to wear a crutch and ask the doctor if he could instead amputate the whole leg . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  the situation would n't stabilise , this is greece you 're talking about , it would never stabilise if we threw them under the bus and told them they can no longer afford to live like europeans and that they should instead be left on their own and hope to pull off a zimbabwe with no aid , no currency , no stability and no hope . 
   from the wikipedia article :   `` communism ( from latin communis - common , universal ) is a revolutionary socialist movement to create a classless , moneyless , and stateless social order structured upon common ownership of the means of production , as well as a social , political and economic ideology that aims at the establishment of this social order ''   classless , stateless and moneyless . 
  and you agree with that ? 
  you think that 's the solution to our problems ? 
  you think that , unlike what happened in all the other times it was attempted , this time we 'd be able to get communism to work as intended ? 
  five years of recession is too much but you also have to realize that we have been accumulating debt for over a decade without economic growth to show for . 
  this was never something that would be quickly fixed . 
  if only we had the room to lower tax rates and make it more attractive to invest in portugal , we 'd get our economy growing again and this would all be so much easier . . 
   the crisis will never end never say never . 
    we will just move to more authoritarian regimes you 're said here several times that you 're a communist , you 've already proposed here that we should , among other things , abolish private property and nationalise all infrastructure . . and you 're the one who fears the most an authoritarian regime ?? 
  lol , irony !!, 
   greece simply does not have the mechanisms to do what it needs to actually fix itself , they can not print money or control their coin exchange rate , they can not impose tariffs and capital controls , etc. 
  those measures would never be a solution , they would just be delaying the issue . 
  till they fix their structural deficits , half-baked measures like symbolic cuts or currency devaluation would be highly ineffective in solving the issue on the long term . 
  it 's images i had saved from video games forums where guys make up new flags for these kinds of silly cultural unions or to incorporate in their flags the countries they annex . 
  [ it 's all in good fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/duckx.jpg ) x ), 
  though i 'd like to see what new borders you propose . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0suvk.png ) ? 
  ( yes , i included greece and macedonia as separate entities within the same union , deal with it . ), 
  i still find it lacking , [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iw4xf.png ) 's a more ` complete ' one . 
  i also have a similar flag but for [ portugal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/an4co.jpg ) . 
   i must have watched a different scrubs to you ... [ ; _  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfwl6ifdk9q ), 
   i ca n't believe you have a linked image from scrubs ... [ ask and you shall receive . 
  i have free web on campus . 
   how much time do you spend on the internet ? 
  [ i live here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pubwf.jpg )  you have a meme picture for nearly everything . 
  [ deal with it . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xcqun.gif )  if i had n't seen you write portuguese before i would say you were american . 
  [ what 's wrong about being american ? 
  [ terrorists on the internet ?? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh2swsvrrmo ) [ better call the government to crack down on the internet !!, 
   [ before upvoting this islamophobic garbage you must ask yourself cui bono , who benefits from you thinking that muslims are backward savages ? 
  obviously , the ones bashing islam and muslims are the warmongering pro-zionist right-wingers . 
  do n't let them dupe you , they 're nothing more than a bunch of disgusting racists . 
   nsfw . 
  it 's redtube , silly . 
   yeah , in europe we call it `` the law '' . 
  do n't quote me , it 's what the article in this very page says . 
   how about ` patriotism ' . 
  loyalty requires irrational faith and patriotism requires irrational devotion .
