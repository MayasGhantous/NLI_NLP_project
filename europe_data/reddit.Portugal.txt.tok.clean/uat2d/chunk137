  yup , we portuguese are scattered all around the world . . :p, 
  or they could take a dump outside and not pay a dime . 
   also , on the beach , there are some paid bathrooms . 
  more incentives for going to the sea . 
   it does n't bother me since they probably make so much money anyway . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  that it 's wrong to take advantage of average businesses but if they 're successful , it 's somehow more ok to interfere ? 
  hard working employees can lose their job because of people like you !, 
  how old were you then and how old are you now ? 
  do you know the language ? 
  these oil prices are killing, 
  ahahaha , it 's funny because we 're mocking stereotypes . 
  afaik , no , the bill is instead sent to the member-state which has to pay for it . 
  the hospital ca n't refuse to treat because it 's from another eu country and the government then also wo n't charge the user for his medical expenses which are covered by the nhs of some other country . 
  i might be mistaken on some of the details as i have n't looked into the laws and treaties where this is defined , but i know of people that went to the netherlands and required a hospital and were pleasantly surprised to find out they would n't have to pay a small fortune like they would if they were n't eu citizens . 
  on the one hand you 're right . 
  on the other hand , greeks have a right to healthcare all over the eu , if an eu citizen requires healthcare services in another country , he ca n't have it denied - so it 's silly to cut healthcare for greeks in greece if they still technically can go to some other eu country and receive healthcare in the nhs of some other country . 
   [ sorry but i tell like it is , too bad if that inconveniences you .

  you know what 's worse than finding a worm in the apple you 're eating ? 
   as a non-religious socialist european i can attest that the only ones bashing islam and muslims are zionist islamophobic right-wingers . 
  and your nickname is workerpowerftw and your comment history is filled with words like ` fascist ' , ` nazis ' , ` zionist ' and ` comrade ' . 
   imagine waiting on italian air support . 
  good grief . 
  * boom !!!, 
  we have nato , which honestly is a lot more trouble than an european army ever would . 
  if we are to work together in these matters , it seems only logic that we 'd put our own interests first in the form of a combined military rather than having to rely on the usa and most of us be part of that agreement which clearly favours their interests . 
  people from castelo branco usually either move to porto or lisbon to work , going all the way to canada is still quite a stretch x ), 
  switzerland has an army and they speak different languages . 
  why would n't it be possible ? 
   so i 've left the motherland were you from the azores ? 
   how is eliminating bureaucracy and need for social services increasing the size of government ? 
  how would you eliminate bureaucracy and downsize the government if you 're increasing its spending ?? 
   this is basically just redistributing various welfare options that are in place now into one giant bag which everyone no matter what their social status would be entitled to . 
  wait , you 'd cut everything else and leave only basic income guarantee ?? 
   and it does n't even mean you need to get completely rid of all the social benefits . 
  some of it could still remain , within the limits of what a country can afford , of course . 
  i really do n't follow . 
  what exactly do you propose ? 
  i disagree , welfare should never be about money but rather about services . 
  besides , if education and healthcare are already assured by the government , why would you want to increase the size of government ? 
  there 's no free lunches , income you 're guaranteeing is income you 're taking away from the people . 
  you can request a galician flag .

  yeah , ireland might beg to differ . 
  no , you ca n't , it would n't let me .

  how about kazakhstan ? 
   i beg to fucking differ what if differ does n't want to fuck with you ?

  as someone who spends way too much time on this specific subreddit , it gets annoying after a while . 
  so you 're not against the eu , you 're simply against the current method for electing mps . 
  i also think the european parliament could be reformed by making meps more accountable and closer to the people they represent . 
  just because the system is still quite flawed , it does n't mean we should abolish it , as no ep or eu would be a much worse alternative . 
  oh , not this again , not here . . please ? 
  dude , it 's been like that since we were like 5000 . 
  do n't take it too seriously , it 's not like it has any actual meaning , 
  do n't be a beast . 
   i would n't say that i 'm a `` europhile '' per se . 
  if you 're in r/europe , you 're an [ europhile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrpmk.png ) . 
    i mean , i do love europe ... as friend . 
  so you have a platonic love for europe ? 
  that 's fine , i also really like europe but it does n't give me a boner or anything . . btw , what 's up with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fmxbg.jpg ) ? 
   how can a union of 27 countries have the same ideas about foreign policy ? 
  the same can be said about the same country , how can cities like liverpool , glasgow or nottingham have the same ideas about foreign policy ? 
  what if some british cities disagree about a conflict a certain government based in westminster wants to be involved in ? 
  it would n't work , unless it was a union , thus handing over all power to westminster . 
  that 's what the counter says !, 
  as of now :  20,038 europhiles, 
   i believe democracy works best when brought back to as local as level as possible . 
  then i agree with you , if things can be solved locally , great , less layers of bureaucracy to deal with . 
  but there 's matters which are more efficiently solved on a wider scope , for example a national or european military or foreign policy , which is why an union like the eu is essential . 
  cyprus is geographically in asia . 
  but that 's ok , [ the eu is n't limited to geographical europe . 
   uh huh , you enjoy giving up all control to your masters in brussels , we on the other hand are out of here at the first chance we get . 
  so while you might have an english flag next to your username , i take it you are a supporter of scottish independence , right ? 
  i mean , you would n't want edinburgh giving up all control to their masters in london , would you ? 
   who cares ? 
  paris and frankfurt wo n't go broke over it . 
  millions and millions of $ uros will be shifted away from france and germany and into the uk and you 're asking ` who cares ? ',

  we do n't need ` allies ' like russia or the usa , fuck them both , we 're the largest economy in the world , we do n't need to negotiate with terrorists . 
  sorry , my bad , i misunderstood you . 
  i still disagree with you , christians are n't under attack , people just do n't care about them as much - it 's not like they 're losing rights . 
  atheists becoming more and getting louder , they should n't stop , yada yada . . 
  it 's ridiculous what that people whine about . 
  if berlusconi is this bad , why did people always vote for him ? 
  you 're begging to find your girlfriend being fucked by a black dude .
