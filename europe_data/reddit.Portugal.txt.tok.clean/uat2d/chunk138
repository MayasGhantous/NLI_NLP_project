   my turn again . 
    speak english , commie . 
  [ come as couves sen\u00e3o levas com o pau !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jipv55synec ) ( gosh , google translates really bad , my sentence in english is `` eat your cabbage or you 'll get hit with a stick '' ), 
  you need to be more obvious when you 're being sarcastic , otherwise people might just think you 're actually that stupid . 
  if we were to make a word cloud of r/europe , i 'm pretty sure ` circlejerk ' would be very high up there . 
  knock it off already !, 
  yeah , people vote based on their opinions and we all have our personal biases , it 's reddit we 're talking about !, 
  either deal with it and move on or do everybody else a favour and get out , just please , stop whining about circlejerks you do n't agree with !, 
   like a maggot consuming an apple from within because we 're all friends here , are n't we chaps ? 
  we are but maggots writhing in the filth of our own corruption !, 
   american checking in . 
    baseball , apple pies , and jesus . 
    i 've done my job . 
  baseball is retarded , jesus is for old people and apple pies are incredibly good and tasty . 
  i like you , american , that was funny , now it 's my turn : futebol , pasteis de nata e am\u00e1lia . 
   i sometimes catch myself actually starting to feel sorry for people living in europe . 
  then i tell myself i must be mad . 
  even with a crisis , europeans still enjoy just about the safest , healthiest and wealthiest lives on the planet . 
  stupid mentality , we should never compare with the ones who are worst of but rather who are best of . 
  it 's the will to improve and ambition that leads to progress , not the `` oh , fuck it , it 's not great but it will do '' type of attitude . 
   in general - any factors that makes you less be able to survive or reproduce . 
  diseases , mental illnesses , handicaps falls in this category - yep this includes homosexuality too . 
  i tend to fuck women while wearing a condom , does that make me sick ? 
  ahaha , that was incredibly funny !, 
  no wonder it 's so controversial , it 's [ dark humour ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_humour ) , not everybody enjoys it , 
   i will also piggyback this comment to say that / r/europe has never and will never be censored in line with the views of the moderators ( with perhaps the exception of repeated hatespeech ) . 
  i was once banned here for supposed hatespeech that did n't even take place in r/europe but rather in the irc channel #europe in snoonet . 
  i was shortly after unbanned and even kept quiet because it would be unnecessary drama but what you 're saying is false . 
   i 'm probarbly posting this in the wrong subbreddit though , or do we have any americans here ? 
  :p it 's still 23h , just go to sleep and check this post tomorrow , you 'll see what i mean when you wake up . 
   but spending money can make the government efficient . 
  it has to be more than just ` spending money ' . 
  otherwise , with the money we spend and spent on our state , we 'd be one of the most efficient states there ever was . 
  and we 're definitely not . 
  please do n't . 
   or cuts in the county budget i live in a metropolitan area . 
   closure of your local library if it 's not sustainable , good riddance , less expense for the taxpayers . 
  besides , there 's always university libraries and e-books and such . 
   how the city council members push some extra income toward the companies they own yup , that can be an issue . 
  but first we need to fix our justice system . 
  lol , do n't get me wrong , i fully agree with you , it 's that we are ( or at least , i am ) constantly receiving news from everything . 
  there 's reddit , there 's [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/ ) , there 's [ spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/ ) , there 's the [ 22h channel news ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/ ) , there 's [ p\u00fablico ] ( http://www.publico.pt/ ) , there 's my facebook feed , there 's [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/home/europe ) and [ di\u00e1rio econ\u00f3mico ] ( http://economico.sapo.pt/ ) in actual paper for free in my school , there 's what my peers and friends talk about in university or in our daily commute , etc etc etc. 
  if something is n't discussed in any of these places then i 'm sure it 's not relevant . 
  africa also receives eu funds and they 're not going to join any time soon . 
  ( dang it , walker_eu , you 're making me look stupid ! ), 
  because i like to piggy around when people talk about pigs , 
  yes , the corporations are evil . 
  yes , this taxi driver is very clever . 
  damn unions !, 
  everybody has to work and these syndicalists get a free pass in not working and in not letting others work !, 
  if the centre of that political compass is trotskyism , then no wonder everybody is right-wing authoritarian !, 
  who said eu membership is a possibility ? 
  sure , they 're technically a candidate trying to accede , but a country that 's  95 % muslim , that still denies the armenian genocide , that still occupies half of cyprus and that borders syria , iraq and iran ? 
  yeah , they 're never going to get in . 
  irish dude !, 
  thankfully there 's still countries in europe that are n't laxed with regards to communism and what it represents . 
  some people seem to forget that it killed more than the nazis . 
   you are likely to miss on local news `` a kitten stuck on a tree was saved by fire-fighters but there 's no footage of the event '' ? 
  political compass ? 
  i think you meant to say [ political test ] ( http://www.politicaltest.net/ ) . 
  terms like ` liberal ' , ` conservative ' and ` social democrat ' are silly in these situations because they mean different things in different places and it 's all about perspective . 
  we could either ask about [ european parties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_political_party#the_europarties ) or make a census of its own with regards to political views ( like pro or against more european integration , stronger immigration restrictions , government subsidies to transportation , etc ) . 
  [ sssss ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9syb7xyi2s ), 
  even if we cured death , i find it hard that we 'd be able to cure boredom and saudade . 
  yeah , i may only have a basic knowledge of science but i knew it was n't actual age that killed us but rather the diseases and ` weakness ' that came along with it . 
  nice video though , the guy was an huge nerd but it was informative . 
   there 's of course the third option ; the eu could reform itself democratically , run a huge campaign for itself in the uk , then intentionally trigger a referendum . 
  if the eu wins , you can have your majority vote . 
  # 3 sounds interesting . . 
   this reinforces my stereotype that northerners are violent knife/axe wielding maniacs . 
  [ that 's obviously a stereotype , it could n't be farther from the truth . 
   good thing they 're training government soldiers [ in guin\u00e9-bissau there was recently a coup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_guinea-bissau_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) where the military overthrew a democracy , the thing about training people from overseas is that you never know if they 'll be your enemies in the future . 
  even bin laden was trained by the americans with that same logic , one could also say back then `` good thing they 're training mujahideens rather than soviets '' . 
  i really hope not to live that long , damn , 100 years , that 's too much . . not that i 'm in a hurry to die , but it must be pretty depressing being alone with nothing to do because everyone you 've ever met is either dead or simply no longer cares for you . . 
  being healthy at 100 years ? 
  geez , one must really enjoy life to find that a blessing . 
   read his name backwards . 
  mind blown !, 
  it 's him !, 
   he 's txampion , a known troll that got banned a few weeks ago . 
  wait , he was banned ? 
  how fucking ridiculous , the welcoming sentence on #europe is a quote from him put there by the mods and they ban him from here ? 
  why ? 
   racist amerikkkan get out . 
  it 's also silly to hate on muslims because , afaik , there are no muslims here , i for one have never seen someone arguing against this kind of discrimination because he personally felt offended due to its own beliefs . 
  that 's why it seems i 'm almost always arguing economic policy , because of all the communists , socialists and syndicalists that also frequent r/europe . 
  it makes things that much more interesting when there are a lot of people arguing back and with much more passion !, 
  if any far-leftie reads this , do n't take me wrong , i do love you because i can hate on what you say !, 
  [ they 're coming for us !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-dtcumcf4 ), 
   i 've got no idea ( ... ) though i do n't like it . 
  typical hater . 
  you are a retard , you should choke on a dick and die . 
  r/circlejerk is that way = = = , 
  [ we should stop with the racist jokes . 
  it 's hard to take you seriously with a nickname like niggerjew, 
  hammer and sickle detected !!, 
   in that case , taxes would have to be low enough so that the lower income people could have access to basic needs with what they make after taxes . 
  or the rates can be set at a ` normal ' value like 25 % and the social benefits of lower income families raised .
