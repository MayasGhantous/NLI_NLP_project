  [ a video made by a redditor about the flaws of fptf ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo ) . 
   er , not sure who `` all '' are . 
  in general ( and i realise there is evidence to the contrary ) the uk and a few others such as denmark i believe , tend to be more of the `` anglo-saxon '' mentality of free market capitalism . 
  i 'm talking about how the eu is great in removing trade barriers . 
  and it 's irrefutable . 
  obviously there will still be fierce competition among eu countries but that also happens on the national level , and thankfully it does , it 's the best way to promote efficiency and to ensure the prices are as low as possible for the customers , as it 's not the role of the government and the taxpayers to artificially keep inefficient companies in business . 
   a year ago . 
  `` china warns it can not ` cure ' eurozone 's debt crisis '' duh , if it 's a debt crisis , it must be us to stop with the debt . 
  again , how is this proof that the eu is to blame ? 
   pretty clearly it is . 
  so you only want to keep ticking along ? 
  then why did you even join in the first place ? 
  everyone thought you wanted much more !, 
  if that 's what you want , you should have never joined and/or left a long time ago . 
  the eu is more ambitious than that , we want much more than `` keep ticking along '' , if that 's what you want , then this might not be the best place for you . 
   in happier days before the euro crisis , one government in lisbon ~ ~ rebranded the algarve as the allgarve , hoping to appeal to english-speaking tourists ~ ~ got into massive debt and now portugal is paying for it . 
  you 'd have to be an idiot to not bother with government overspending but then act surprised and complain with the austerity that must follow it . 
  to my fellow countrymen who want to protest because of the current state of affairs , the one who stole from you is n't in [ s\u00e3o bento ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c9kyo.jpg ) but rather in [ paris ] ( http://i.imgur.com/arg8p.jpg ) . 
  what is wrong with privatisations ? 
  i 've donated blood recently , should i change my id ? 
   if that database is compromised by either the government or hackers , you 're screwed . 
  there 's countless databases which , if compromised , could screw up your life . 
   nah , i 'm talking about the eurozone going cap-in-hand to china trying to get them to buy ez debt , only for you to be turned away with your tail between your legs . 
  i 'm portuguese and i never heard about this . 
  are you sure you 're not making shit up ? 
   having begged virtually every country on earth for a bailout , i can understand why you would forget that this happened , however . 
  unfortunately , my memory is fine . 
  it would be nice if i could forget the shit our socialist government did , but i ca n't , it was too bad . 
  however , i ca n't recall this . 
  again , you 're sure we 're in the same page ? 
   we 're `` overshadowed '' by china and the us currently but manage to keep ticking along . 
  just like iceland , you 'll manage to keep ticking along . 
  the question here is if that 's all you want . 
   cap agreed . 
  the single market should also be a free market with minimal government intervention , we have no need for government subsidies that end up going to waste , that 's incredibly inefficient . 
   the eu reeks of the same old corruption that we see in the club med countries . 
  it does ? 
  from my perspective , eu corruption is meaningless , comparable to that of the uk or france - it 's there but it 's hardly a factor . 
   the eu is a not very democratic and as we have seen in italy and greece when push comes to shove the establishment knows best ( tm ) in both those cases , the situation on the national level was at a standstill . 
  not anti-democratic as the eu institutions are democratic and every eu member-state must be a functioning democracy . 
  people saying `` oh , monti was n't elected '' or `` i did n't vote for barroso '' , that 's taking this out of proportion - sure , the system could be improved , but even the uk itself has a ruling monarch and a house of lords and even the house of commons work in a fptp system which on its own are serious flaws to democracy , and people seem to ignore these . 
   given our culturual outlook it is harder for the uk to build alliances within the eu ( e.g. 
  free market v protectionism ) . 
  what do you mean ? 
  are n't you all supporters of free trade ? 
  is n't the eu great in removing trade barriers at least between its member-states ? 
   not really . 
  london is also a massive clearing centre for dollar denominated transactions . 
  hey everybody , this guy thinks we wo n't be overshadowed by the eu !, 
  he thinks he 'll have a say in international affairs and will be able to compete with the rest of the eu or with the usa , russia , china , india and brazil !, 
  ahahah , comedy gold !, 
  xd  but hey , were n't you the ones crawling to china a few months ago for a bailout ? 
  oh yes , yes you were . 
   how humiliating . 
  we did ? 
  you must be talking about the partial concession of edp to them . 
  how is a privatization an humiliation ? 
  they were the ones who paid the most , what 's wrong about it ? 
  yeah , i 'd rather if it was entirely privatized , but what the heck , a partial privatization is n't even comparable to an humiliation . 
  but you 're quite funny , assuming that the debt our government got into is the eu 's fault and not our own . 
   if the british are alright with being the canada to the eu 's us then by all means they 're welcome to . 
  what an horrible comparison . 
  if the uk was to the eu what canada is to the us , i 'd rather be a british/canadian . 
   further , london 's starting to diversify away from europe . 
  recent deals with the chinese on providing clearing houses for the rmb ( and hopefully many other currencies to follow ) should see us through . 
  oh , ok then , you do n't need europe because you have china , good to know . 
  lol, 
   some of us might actually have principles that say that britain ought to be ruled by the british . 
  [ look at all these foreigners ruling over the british . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cameron_ministry ), 
  in that case , how much do you think would be too much ? 
  what really needs to change in the eu , what are you not willing to give up and what should be the limits of european integration ? 
  i 'm always interesting in listening to british input in these situations . 
   are you implying something ? 
  something racial ? 
  i 'm not implying anything , i 'm saying it outright - it 's nobody 's fault but their own that they did n't integrate . 
  it 's not about race , it 's about their culture . 
  everyone else can integrate much easier with less while the gypsies are provided with much more and never integrate , it 's them who choose to live as outcasts , not working and instead thieving for a living . 
   * prepares tagging function * nobody cares about your tags . 
   the roma integration program failed miserably throughout europe . 
  name me one place where the roma integrated . 
  you ca n't , because they do n't . 
  it should read `` throughout europe and the world , roma integration failed miserably . '', 
   `` we had no running water , let alone a bathroom . '', 
  that 's no problem for them , it seems . 
   i love that our escalation is getting naked on the protest eheh . 
  [ relevante ( pt ) ] ( http://inimigo.publico.pt/noticia/detail/1567600 ) [ relevant \\ ( translation \\ ) ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2finimigo.publico.pt%2fnoticia%2fdetail%2f1567600 ), 
   beyond the single market and external trade policy -- red lines for everyone else -- this leaves precious little left from which britain can exclude itself . 
  this . 
  unlike the other member-states , it seems the uk is just looking for an efta , not an eu . 
  this makes me wonder , what exactly will be asked in their eventual referendum ? 
  if the uk should be declared a special member and only participate in the eu in areas related to trade or if the uk should leave the eu outright and rejoin efta ? 
   which could be a screamer it 's not , it 's some pirates dancing edit : noipmaxt deleted his post , [ this ] ( http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf ) is what he posted originally . 
  take my word for it , it tastes great , 
   you misunderstand - i had no problems with them at all because you 're like them ? 
  because you also stink , you 're broke and you rather steal than work for a living ? 
  that must be it . 
   oh , fuck off and educate yourself . 
  i 'd say `` gypsie detected '' but i 'm still wondering how you 're literate . 
  indeed , it 's 21h30 , i ca n't work now .
