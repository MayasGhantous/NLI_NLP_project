   britain is already a group of countries ( england , wales , scotland , northern ireland ) who exist in a union ( scotland may go its own way , granted ) . 
  if we join euroland , then in effect britain itself dies , it 's replaced by something else because we 're then in a union with the rest of the eu . 
  the city of london is part of the metropolitan area of london which is part of england which part of the uk . 
  a city within a city within a country within a country . 
  chances are , another layer of countries on top wo n't change anything else under it . 
  what a ridiculous claim , `` oh , the eu means there 's no countries '' . 
  that 's like germany destroyed bavaria or that the uk itself destroyed scotland . 
   i personally am proud of being `` british '' , being `` british '' means something different to being `` english '' to me and were britain to join a federal eu , then `` britain '' to me would no longer exist . 
  so it 's about silly nationalistic pride . 
  whatever floats your boat , dude , but it 's still silly to assume that they 're incompatible . 
  being english does n't prevent anyone from saying he 's from manchester , being british does n't prevent anyone from saying he 's from scotland and being european will not prevent anyone to say he 's british . 
  as an outsider , that 's exactly the only problem i have with the tories - they too pro-usa and too anti-europe , their suspicion of the eu seems irrational . 
  it 's as if they do n't think they 're part of europe , that the rest of us are out to get them . 
  i 'd probably still vote for them because of your voting system that gives severe disadvantages to 3rd parties ( first past the post per constituency , right ? ), 
  and because they 're still much better than labour . 
   it depresses me how everybody had sex during their erasmus ... except me , apparently . 
  holy fuck , you missed a lifetime opportunity . 
  you were far from home and with people your age , what the fuck did you do at night if not party and getting laid ? 
   this is a lovely idea but i really do n't think nobel prize money should be used to fund government programs . 
  it 's funding education . 
  where else will you invest it in ? 
  what other use of such money would be more worthwhile than the erasmus program ? 
  what 's the point of having money and not spending it on siesta and fiesta ? 
  i was expecting boobs . 
  i wonder if we can find tits from every country in europe . 
  i 'll start with [ norway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1baba.jpg ) . 
  that 's disrespectful to fags . 
  [ i 've got this event in the past , it was easy , all it was needed was a priest . 
  yeah , as an outsider , it seemed to be you have more misconceptions about the rest of the germans than the rest of the germans have about bavarians . . 
  [ oh , na , na , what 's my name ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0cgsw6h60k ), 
  are you from bavaria ? 
  germans here on r/europe mention it quite some times but i never hear anything about it on the news so i do n't know . 
  thanks for the info . 
   if this continues every country in europe will probably fall apart in small fiefdoms except germany .

  do you think there 's a possibility for bavaria to actually ever become independent from germany ? 
   if you allow gay couples to adopt ( and there is really no reason not to ) , you need to adapt legal documents accordingly . 
  that 's one of the worst ways to adapt them . 
  what 's wrong with fathers or mothers ? 
  the vast majority will continue to have a mother and a father , these wo n't change to parent # 1 and parent # 2 . 
  and even for gay couples this does n't sounds helpful at all , nobody will call their parents by their number !, 
   politically correct idiots just being politically correct idiots . 
  seems accurate to me . 
   propaganda against communism it would n't even begin to balance things . 
   it has an anti-lgbt agenda the article seemed unbiased enough . 
  that 's stupid as fuck . 
  what 's wrong with ` father & mother ' , ` father & father ' and ` mother & mother ' or ` parents ' ? 
  why do they have to change everything just to not offend some people who might get displeased at simple words ? 
  what 's next , giving everyone a serial number instead of a name because kids might be mocked if they have an odd name ? 
  you 're probably an extremist , an asshole or both . 
  knock it off with the retardedness and with trying to associate with the political right , nutjobs like you are an embarrassment to the rest of us . 
  731 million ? 
  i was under the impression we were ` only ' [ 503 million ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00001 ) . 
  not even comparable to [ r/worldnews ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11d0vj/italian_church_to_be_stripped_of_tax_exemption/ ), 
  and i might just as well be a maoist jewish irish/polish-american with a thing for scat . 
  you never know for sure . 
  holy fuck , trolling r/europe is getting easier by the day . 
   yea ... you maybe found that in some economic textbook from the 1970s . 
  you know , reality works a little different . 
  i was simplifying things for the sake of the argument but i 'm not wrong . 
  i stand by my statement - if morocco sells fishing quotas to the eu , it 's because they benefit from it otherwise they would n't sell them in the first place and less moroccan fishermen is n't necessarily a bad thing as they can then specialize in a sector where they 're more competitive . 
  if you think i 'm mistaken , then by all means , please correct me . 
   besides , are n't you that uber-racist troll ?

  tag him as a troll and do n't bother too much , it 's kind of silly always seeing people getting so mad at posts like the ones he makes here and then generalizing what he says to all of the community . 
  i got my eu citizenship for free !, 
  lol !, 
  we do n't have an european army . 
  who 'd command and coordinate everything ? 
   you are either one more of the fascists and racists that this subreddit is crawling with lately or you are totally ignorant of what golden dawn represents , is doing in greece and what it is capable of doing . 
  so you call him of a troll and you continue to try to make sense of what he says ? 
  where are these guys ? 
  60 years and counting . 
  give it 10 more years and these commies will have outlived the ussr . 
  but since you linked to a ukip video , you must be right . 
  any day now they 'll start the collectivizations , open up the gulags and change the national anthem to something like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzjgwwjxdiq ) . 
  fuck these commies . 
   it 's dehonesting the prize itself , the eu does n't contribute to peace in any way . 
  it 's the lasting peace between the countries that allow the eu to be happening . 
  you mistakenly switched cause and effect , bro . 
   obama managed to push one of those : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons he also managed to blow up more than the gdp of australia in cruise missiles in libya alone , so it was still hypocritical to give him the nobel peace prize . 
   you have not mentioned what happened in the early 90s between the ex-yugoslav states . 
  so because countries that are not part of the eu were involved in wars , the eu has been a failure in keeping the peace ? 
  what 's next , we did n't prevent the conflicts in georgia or in south sudan , we 're no longer a paragon of peace ? 
  nope , it was the shared economic interest that kept us at peace , not nato . 
  and it would be ridiculous to award nato the peace prize , considering they 're actively bombing countries and destabilizing regions . 
  bad uk , bad !, 
  ( next tuesday we 'll trash them , do n't you worry !, 
  too bad the council of europe , albeit having the same flag and anthem as the eu , is independent from it . 
  we could send the president of the european council , herman van rompuy , though he 'd probably be too socially awkward . 
   who gets paid ? 
  corrupt government officials . 
  that 's not our problem .
