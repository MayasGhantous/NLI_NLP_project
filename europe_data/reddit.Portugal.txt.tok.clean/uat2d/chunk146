   yea , their fishing industry is not very advanced . 
  but without the huge subsidies to the eu fishing industry they could easily compete on price . 
  and sometimes they still do , despite the subsidies . 
  because they earn so little . 
  you 're absolutely right , the subsidies driving down the cost are inefficient and wasteful . 
   but now they do n't earn anything , because the waters are empty . 
  wrong , they 're paid their fishing rights . 
  and it 's not like you mentioned initially where they become unemployed and it destroys their industry - it actually frees up their workforce and it allows for them to specially in other sectors . 
  that 's 45 % too much . 
   if you let the fisherman handle that themselves we have no fish left within 5 years i presume . 
  imposing a quota to preserve the sustainability of the fisheries is not even comparable to the current situation with massive subsidies paid by our tax money which is neither environmental friendly nor efficient - proof of this is that these ministers and their policies just had to destroy 17k tonnes of fish they could n't sell . 
  it pains me to agree with such an eurosceptic but you 're absolutely right . 
  they really need to reform and further the free market , this waste of resources is unacceptable . 
   have to buy fishing rights from african governments so they fish those costs clear that the fishers in africa loose their job does not compute . 
  firstly , the eu hardly fishes in africa because of said fishing rights , secondly , your logic is flawed because you say we pay them and , even so , they lose their fishing sectors and they are harmed because of this - have n't you ever heard of comparative advantages ? 
  are n't they paid for the resources and do n't they free up time which they can spend on other activities ? 
   they should just let the prices fall and if necessary lose market share to third-world countries . 
  there 's a much easier solution , stopping the massive subsidies - it 's money going to waste . 
  switzerland . 
  the usa sucks . 
   generally , populists tend to claim that they side with `` the people '' against `` the elites '' . 
  yes , just like the eu . 
  mafia ties in italy ? 
  quick , call the fashion police !, 
  i 'd vote for [ gangnam hitler ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tilqds7-jg ) . 
   `` who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid ? '', 
   `` i woke up this morning in the back of a transit van with two beautiful little girls , i found april in a hopeless place . '', 
   `` could have just started the greatest facebook argument ever . 
  april fools , who wants maddie ? 
  i love april jones . '', 
  will i also get jail time ? 
   however , i 'd be very happy with the eu if it were democratic . 
  did you know that there are elections for the european parliament ? 
   you say that politicians should not want to cut on health and education , yet you completely miss the fact that they are indeed cut all over the world and are heavily pushed on greece by the troica they are n't cut all over the world and troika is n't cutting back on healthcare and education , it 's simply cutting back on the excessive public spending . 
   you say that say that in a capitalistic free market everything would be working well , yet you can only point me to switzerland for that imaginary thing , and everywhere there are strict regulations and interference from national governments . 
  if governments did n't regulate and interfere they would be called `` arbiters '' or `` reporting agencies '' . 
  there would n't even be a need to have those bloody elections every four years unfortunately a lot of other places are n't real direct democracies like switzerland and once a certain group gets hold of power , they tend to deviate from a free market which is best for all of society to another system which is slightly better for the people in power but overall worse to the rest of society . 
  the usa is n't a free market , the ussr was n't a free market , a dictatorship ( pre-1974 ) portugal was n't a free market , a democratic ( post-1974 ) portugal is n't a free market , etc etc etc. 
  switzerland , on the other hand , has always kept a balance of power through direct democracy and because of that , they 've been a free market for the longest time and their development and economic success is proof of that . 
   you claim that greece could simply not buy from germany , yet you neglect the obvious fact that a country like greece is heavily economically and politically dependent from countries like germany and usa . 
  really , dependency is not just a phenomenon of capitalism , it 's documented throughout the history . 
  i was talking about military hardware . 
  if greece does n't need it , why should they buy it ? 
  are n't they rational ? 
   you claim that the role of the state is not to run businesses , yet you claim that the state should really run health care , education and military ( i would n't disagree with you ) , some of the biggest sectors , and that are quite profitable if run like businesses . 
  no , i said the state should run the police , the fire-fighters , the military and the courts . 
  these are n't businesses , these are areas which have always been in the sphere of the state . 
  as for healthcare and education , i did n't say that the state should run them , i said they should assure that everyone must have access - which is to say , private hospitals and private schools but the state paying a percentage of the cost of the user ( though this is only my opinion , to combine the efficiency of the free market with the social democracy of allowing everyone regardless of background and financial situation to have access to healthcare and education - others might disagree ) . 
   you claim that businesses run by the public sector are of no cost to the taxpayers , yet when those same taxpayers will try to use them it would be much more costly for them because companies will try to make a buck , something that does not always mean better services or cheap fares . 
  no , i said that businesses run by the ** private ** sector are of no cost to the taxpayer , which is true , unlike state-owned companies , the privates are n't financed by the taxpayers . 
  oh , and of course that companies will try to make a buck , who does n't ? 
  even the state does that , everything has its price . 
  it 's why you need a free market , to allow competition and to make sure you reach a price of equilibrium , where demand meets supply and the price is fair from everyone . 
  if you indeed want to bring the prices down , you 'll support this system - it 's the only one that makes sure these companies will try their best to deliver their products as cheap as possible or with as much quality as possible ( otherwise they 'd be put out of business ) . 
  this is a much better alternative than a state-monopoly . 
  oh , and you said this is costlier which is false , the price which might be higher on the spot is actually lower because the state wo n't tax you as much . 
  regardless of who offers the service , it has to be paid for - and the private sector is the only one who has in its best interest to make it the best possible . 
   you want a government that does not interfere with the free market , yet i am sure you do n't want monopolies and cartels to be formed . 
  ( of course you could say that you do n't have problem with monopolies and cartels , but i assume that it 's logical given your replies ) a free market is strictly against monopolies . 
  it 's not free if the supply is only offered by one entity . 
  while there are cases where monopolies may be formed naturally ( like when the marginal costs are decreasing - which require a big initial investment but then it gets easier to provide the service to more people ) , these are the exception and can be regulated . 
  you seem to forget that in these cases , privately-owned or state-owned , it 's always a monopoly nevertheless - the private sector may have the benefit of maximizing profits with the lack of competition ( as long as they do n't push it too much , if they did , they 'd be allowing competition to prop up and putting them out of business as the competition would probably drive these out of business ) but the state continues to not have the incentive to maximize efficiency and if they are careless with their spending , it 's all of society that will have to pay through taxes . 
   you say that capitalism is about protecting individual freedoms , but what does the word `` freedom '' mean when you politicians put the interests of the big companies above the interests of the people ? 
  how are you free when you do n't have a job , do n't have health care , are being heavily policed and the big companies report big profits ? 
  when a politician puts the interests of corporations above the one of his voters , he 's not a capitalist or a believer in a free market , he 's a corporatist and a defender of the powers that be . 
  this is the opposite of a free market because he 's taking a stance and not letting the free market decide who should get what . 
  this is outright corruption and is also anti-democratic . 
  again , check switzerland , they do n't seem to have any of this there because they 're a direct democracy . 
   stay classy greek guys . 
  nice generalization . 
   - edit - a downvote ? 
  what for ? 
  i just asked a simple question ... 
  welcome to reddit . 
   the usual fucktards around here seem to be downvoting you why do you have to call people here of fucktards and why are you complaining of downvotes when they 're irrelevant ? 
  [ v\u00e4ttern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4ttern ) your post was linking both lakes to the first one , v\u00e4rnen . 
   you 're an anarchocapitalist according to wikipedia :  in an anarcho-capitalist society , law enforcement , courts , and all other security services would be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation lol , this is so utterly retarded . 
  no , i 'm not an anarchist . 
   or other denomination of extreme-free-market-ism , are n't you ? 
  yes , i believe a free market is much more efficient than a government run economy at providing for the general welfare of everyone . 
  you do n't ? 
   otherwise , you would n't ask a question like this . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/workers_rights#core_labor_standards ) so let 's see :  * freedom of association : workers are able to join trade unions that are independent of government and employer influence ;  * the right to collective bargaining : workers may negotiate with employers collectively , as opposed to individually ;  * the prohibition of all forms of forced labor : includes security from prison labor and slavery , and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress ;  * elimination of the worst forms of child labor : implementing a minimum working age and certain working condition requirements for children ;  * non-discrimination in employment : equal pay for equal work . 
  hey !, 
  i agree with all of these !, 
  i honestly do !, 
  if these are the workers ' rights you demand , you 're absolutely right , anything else would be unfair . 
  forgive me , i thought you were talking about the other kind of `` workers ' rights '' like the impossibility of firing someone or forcing companies to continue to provide for their workers even long after they are no longer employed there !, 
  my bad !, 
   that 's my point ; even though individually each country has an incentive to lower their taxes and workers ' rights and all that , at the end of the day we all * gain something if countries cooperate and raise them instead . 
   * = except the rich , i guess firstly , most countries hardly have any incentives to lower their taxes ( the more money the state receives , the more power the politicians have ) or their workers ' rights ( this one is kinda silly , any politician that wanted to cut back on these would probably never get elected - they have all the incentives to support them and favour them even more - considering this is a democracy , of course ) . 
  secondly , what 's your problem with the rich ? 
  just because some people are wealthier than others , that does n't make them worse - they might be more annoying but they 're entitled to the same rights as everybody else and always throughout history there have been people who were better off than others . 
  i do n't understand what 's your problem with them , it 's like you want to punish them simply for being rich . 
  i 'd rather work and one day be rich as well than spending my life hating on them !, 
   the imf has admitted it completely underestimated the effects of austerity on the irish economy and believed the ** tax increases ** and spending cuts would not have ** cost so many jobs ** . 
  holy fuck , is this really the imf ? 
  i shudder at their ignorance !, 
   the laws are made by the bankers and politicians .
