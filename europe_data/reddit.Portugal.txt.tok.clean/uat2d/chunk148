  we 'll always have closer ties with spain than with the rest of europe , but there 's no need to add bureaucracy to our cultural and historical union , we 're fine the way we are , two separate nations working together in pretty much everything . 
  btw , are you galician ? 
   they do n't perform all of the destructive financial greed what 's wrong with greed ? 
  the whole world runs on greed . 
  as long as they follow the law , it 's perfectly fine . 
   is that tax havens screw countries up . 
  or , from another perspective , high tax rates screw countries up . 
  the uk seems to be the exception . 
  on the rest of europe , you have the right-wing parties that want to further the free market and you have the left-wing parties against it saying it 's against the worker 's rights , that we 'll be enslaved by germany or whatever bullshit the decide to spew . 
  you just did . 
   i just do n't get why so many ** communist ** greeks seem to be pissed off at germany . 
  ftfy and now it 's self-explanatory . 
  not shown in the pic : the greeks which know that difficult choices have to be made and that there 's no easy way out of this mess that the massive spending policies got them into . 
   i do n't think it 's a joke , i browsed through his other comments to be sure and many express the same ideology . 
  he 's a troll , and a obvious one at that . 
  on the one hand , he sometimes is funny , but on the other hand , he 's too obvious and if it 's always the same thing , it gets old . 
  you 're replying seriously to a jokingly comment . 
  that 's an interesting proposal . 
  yeah , i think i 'd fancy if the capital of portugalicia was in santiago de compostela rather than in lisbon , for starters it would be closer to porto !, 
  i do n't know how the rest of the country would feel about it though . 
  i want to go easy on croatia because they 're going to join the eu next year but i have to say this : croatia , you have one of the ugliest borders of all time . 
   my concern is that the example set by the secessionists will sparkle the same ideology not only in other regions os spain , like the basque country and ** galicia ** nah , galicia wo n't ever secede . 
  they 're quite small and too closely related to spain to seriously try to achieve independence . 
  now jokingly , as a portuguese , it would be quite funny if it did and we incorporated it into portugal - it would be the ultimate middle finger to spain and it would be like brazil incorporating portugal or the usa incorporating the uk , considering it was portugal that declared independence from galicia some ~ 900 years ago . 
  you forgot to mention that inflation in this globalized market would have much more serious impacts now that they 're dependent on the rest of the world on goods like fuel or food . 
  i wonder how they 'd manage then . 
  the current spending cuts are nothing compared to this alternative where they 'd face shortages of even the most basic goods . 
  when i read your post i thought i had missed the quotation marks but you 're right , the whole article is written by him . 
  my bad . 
  still , fucking ridiculous . 
  is this a main character in greek politics ? 
  is this the guy that represents the main opposition party in greece ? 
  this ignorant , really ? 
  dude , let me tell you , for the sake of all of us i honestly hope he never gets to power - if he does , you 'll collapse , we 'll get a lot of the fallout and the eu will get severely weakened with all this . 
  this makes it worse , at first i thought this was just awful journalism but now i see this could be the greek pm . 
  sure , we have idiots here as well but not that influential . 
  we have fools in power but they try ( badly ) to make ends meet and get the country back on tracks again . 
  the problem with those guys is that they 're committed on crashing the economy for everybody else with their ignorance and their retarded ideology and they actually have a chance of achieving just that . 
   the government argues that only the austerity agenda can make the greek public debt viable again . 
  but the opposite is true . 
  austerity policies prevent the economy from returning to growth . 
  austerity creates a vicious spiral of recession and an increase in debt that in turn leads both greece and its lenders to calamity . 
    all this is known to the european and greek policymakers and elites , including merkel , who aim to implement similar programmes in all european countries facing debt problems , such as spain , portugal and italy . 
  why do they insist so dogmatically on this disastrous political and economic path ? 
  we believe that their aim is not to solve the debt crisis but to create a new regulatory framework throughout europe that is based on cheap labour , deregulation of the labour market , low public spending and tax exemptions for capital . 
  holy fuck , it 's like i 'm reading communist propaganda !, 
  i 've been warned in the past that the guardian can be quite biased and left-wing , but this is bullshit , i 've met actual communists that were n't this crazy !, 
  `` hurr durr , austerity bad , spending good . 
  merkel mean and banks evil . 
  we 're too dumb to know what to do with our money , please tax everyone massively and spend our money for us , if it worked in other planned economies like gdr , ussr , cuba and dprk , it will work in greece as well '', 
  certainly , but you 're talking about an extreme case here , it 's not like the dude that makes 5000 $ on the side and does n't declare it , it 's 12 million . 
  that 's why it 's news . 
  not because it 's a conspiracy . 
  my point was that these acts were committed not only by people affiliated with the church . 
  the news here provides accurate data of what a person said . 
  it 's not unfounded hate towards a group . 
  afaik the article was about a greek that was committing fraud , not about how the greeks poison the wells or how they are the vermin of society . 
  it 's not comparable . 
  yeah , i would n't blame it all on the clergy . 
  if you got hit with the ruler several times because you did n't know how to properly multiply or if you were slapped in the head and humiliated in front of the class because you did n't do your homework ( because you had to help your family working the fields or whatever ) , that 's probably not the fault of the church but more the fault of the whole culture and education that the people that at the time were the teachers had . 
  back then things were different for everyone , i 'm sure , if even a teacher could get in trouble for using `` red apples '' as an example because red could be associated with communism , well , it 's certainly a dysfunctional society , not something you can just go `` it 's the clergy 's fault '' and leave it at that , it 's much more . 
  fuck you germany , we do n't need your money , all we need is love . 
  lol , just kidding . 
  now seriously , please do n't act like that , like we 'd want to break up with you . 
  just like we do n't generalize what some germans do and say `` these germans are evil '' , do n't go with what some of us say and go `` southern europe will be hit much more '' , as if we have it coming or as if we deserve it . 
   thousands of children fell victim to violence and abuse in catholic boarding schools in switzerland up ** until the 1970s ** in switzerland and not only . 
  when i was a kid , all the adults and elderly people told me stories about how they were abused when they were in school . 
  txampion ? 
  comparing paying back loans with the holocaust . 
  are you really this stupid ? 
  kein problem :p, 
   i did n't take into account the separatist movements in spain , i am aware of eta , that the catalans want their own state etc , but is this so bad that it threatens the economic recovery of spain ? 
  do you have any links/further reads you could recommend on this issue ? 
  eta signed a permanent ceasefire and their militancy seems to be dying down , the separatist movement is still there but do n't confuse the separatist movement with the terrorist group it spawned . 
  i do n't have links but it 's quite often discussed here and you can google about this issue and learn more about it on your own . 
  in essence , the movements are there and while as of now there is n't a threat of spain collapsing and several regions acquiring independence , it 's definitely a factor to consider when asking the population for sacrifices - the more you demand from them , the greater the support of independence . 
  it 's somewhat similar with scotland - if a government they do n't exactly identify with asks too much of them , they might get fed up and separatist feelings become more widely accepted . 
   ireland is on a good way ireland 's issue was the housing bubble and the financial mess that followed it , not a structural problem . 
   portugal is man ( country ? ), 
  enough to look at their own mistakes and issues and try to fix them it 's proving quite difficult to fix them . 
  popular opinion is worsening and i personally find it awful that out of the five big parties , the communists and the left bloc restless continue to use this to further their anti-eu and anti-free market agenda , the socialists suffer from amnesia considering they were the ones that got us in this mess and the social democrats and the centre-right that are now both in power in a coalition are going the easy short-term way of clearing public debt which is by raising taxes . 
  so yeah , we 're cutting a lot of wasteful spending that we had but i still do n't know if i 'll be able to find a job here when i finish university because the taxes are unbearable and it 's like we 're inviting people to leave the country and telling them it would just be easier if they emigrated . 
   spain is n't as fucked as any of the other countries down there ( yet ? ), 
  spain is in a similar situation that we 're in , their structural problems are n't as serious but they 're much more fractured and with the separatist movements they have , it can prove a greater challenge . 
   same goes for italy yup , italy is like ireland , they 're pretty much in the clear . 
  the problem we have with greece is that what goes on there has repercussions here and its failure would prove immensely harmful to us and we really do n't want to go down their road . 
  they had [ swag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bfrnh.jpg ) , your argument is invalid . 
   ask germans what they feel about bailing out ireland , portugal and spain and you 'll hear few complaints . 
  trust me , a lot of portuguese complain about the bailout . 
  not about germany 's role , of course , you did everything you had to do and even more , no , what people complain is why we were stupid enough to ever get that bad and require a bailout in the first place . 
  that and the economies and the societies are too interconnected for it . 
  good luck in starting a war when such an event is strictly against the business interest of many and when the people in military age have also had great experiences and know much more from the other countries . 
  even in the worst scenario you could imagine , it would be hard to conceive a war when businesses in germany still are deeply involved in greece , where a lot of germans in their early 20s did erasmus in countries like greece and where the military budgets are minimal and there 's instant communication between people from all over europe . 
  tanks are much cooler than a nerd behind the counter smirking . 
  i already messaged the mods here but got no reply . 
  anyway , fucking [ stop with the spam , smujal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ysatd.png ) . 
  not meant to be funny . 
   or why not move to a muslim country for half a year ? 
  i rather not to , i mean , sweden 's fine but i do n't think i 'd manage . 
   in vancouver there have been two violent riots because of the stanley cup in the last twenty years .
