  ! 1 xddddddddddddd amirite guys ?? 
  guys ? 
   seriously though , each and every time germany got fucked up , poland got fucked up even worse [ poland-lithuania was massive ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_1635.svg/1000px-polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_1635.svg.png ) , if they ended up getting smacked around by every power around them , it 's their own fault . 
   to be fair , by that logic every nation in europe has lost territory . 
  not portugal !, 
  portugal undefeated since 1143 !, 
  corsica is a bad idea , new caledonia would be much better . 
  the farther away from europe , the better . 
  that way , we can ship them all there and nuke them without even having to worry with the fallout . 
  that also happens to me when i shoot myself up with meth, 
   i always laugh when people tell me how they admire my nation of birth , germany , for its ability to come back again after severe defeats . 
  [ is this untermensch serious ? 
   spanish politics according to a ** chinese ** tv in taiwan taiwan is part of the prc , ftfy, 
  short answer : no . 
  long answer : nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . 
   i ca n't believe religion is becoming such a big issue again here in europe . 
  it 's not `` religion '' , it 's `` one religion '' . 
   i suspect uat2d is old enough not to worry about those stories anymore ... 
  i used to believe in god but then i started growing up . 
  when the day comes , me and my ass will be ready . 
  thanks for your concern but it 's none of your business . 
  i 'm going to get my butthole tattooed and there 's nothing you can do to stop it . 
  [ does this make you mad ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gbvf8fzpi0 ), 
   she says that she is fundamentally opposed to violence , but that attacks on infidels are not the same thing as violence . 
   `` the attacks are merely calls for help , and the bombs are the weapons of the weak and the oppressed . '', 
  so if someone arrests a muslim for terrorism that means we 're violent but if a muslim blows himself up that means he 's crying for help and that he was actually oppressed ? 
  brb , gon na strap myself up on explosives and commit a peaceful act of killing and mutilating random bystanders to demonstrate by oppression . 
    what would make for a perfect world ? 
    `` if there were more understanding for us , tolerance and sharia everywhere , '' says reyhana . 
  [ is this bitch serious ? 
  it should be :  france will expel those threatening security and secular values ~ ~ in the name of islam ~ ~ the way it 's worded , it 's as if some ideologies get a free pass in threatening security and secular values . 
  to you , to me and to everybody else . 
  but ( unfortunately ) it 's not only that . 
  [ my reaction to these wonderful news . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_4mzhhuf0 ), 
  we also a massive debt from the sheer size of the government , it 's not all just ` corruption ' . 
  what 's a mirror ? 
  you mean a webcam ? 
  out, 
  exactly , so it 's silly to use that argument to call franco of hitler because the very same argument could be used for churchill . 
  sure , both franco and churchill were n't the most considerate leaders , but saying they were like hitler is just diminishing the outright insanity of the nazi regime . 
  upvote to kick the gypsies out of europe . 
  you missed the irony in my post . 
  just like the british did with india . 
   she is famous for this phrase : `` better fascist than fag '' ( fag as a translation for a derogatory term for `` gay '' ) . 
  she often said that she is proud of being fascist , too . 
  i have a thing for strong independent women . 
  seems like someone i 'd like to bang . 
   he just did n't join hitler in wwii because spain was too exhausted from the civil war . 
  not really , they had their differences :  [ spain in world war ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spain_in_world_war_ii )  hitler threatened franco with a possible annexation of spanish territory by vichy france . 
  at the end of the day , no agreement was reached . 
  a few days later in germany , hitler would famously tell mussolini , `` i prefer to have three or four of my own teeth pulled out than to speak to that man again ! '', 
  r/circlelejerk is that way = = = = , 
   this country was too good to be true ... danish hairy women `` too good to be true '' ? 
  my search engine has been google.co.uk for ages , i do n't think it will ever change . 
  when i was younger i 'd go with google.pt but i got fed up with all the brazilian suggestions . 
  [ what the fuck ?

   not everyone has me tagged as a `` neo-liberal scumbag '' you clearly are n't working hard enough at spreading your message then . 
  just like switzerland !, 
   man you 're gon na get a shitton of downvotes that 's not one gets downvotes . 
   hey r/europe , i think it should be illegal to be offensive . 
  there !, 
  now we wait . 
  boy , i feel silly now . 
  damn , you 're everywhere . 
   [ at the start of the 20th century , france , switzerland and san marino were the only european nations to have a republican form of government . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchies_in_europe ) that novelty wore off a long time ago .

   bhutan famously pursues gross national happiness rather than gross national product . 
  does their government subsidize blowjobs ? 
   fucked over by a bunch of vile corruptocrats [ here 's a video of barroso getting slapped ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8cshva_6yse#t=143s ) , maybe it will calm you down . 
   your irish elite sold you out so hard to the eu elites in lisbon fuck , he 's onto us !, 
   have a cup of tea and relax . 
  crisis averted !, 
  stop being a dick . 
  andrewsmith1986 will be fine with this . 
  yeah , i 'd be pretty pissed ( literally ) if it happened to me !, 
  edit : oh , right , sorry , i missed greece in the title , no , you 're right , this happened in the industrial area of porto ( zona industrial do porto ) . 
  i do n't know from personal experience but i 've had a close friend who had a golden shower from a drunk chick and he told me it was n't that nice , though he was also too wasted to bother too much at the time , only later it hit him . 
  so yeah , that 's the extent of my knowledge of a golden shower at dawn . 
  i do n't dress like a slob , i dress casually . 
  so do my friends . 
  what 's the matter ? 
  you 're right , but then again , thinking some protest will bring change for the better is being naive , no ? 
   people around the world are paying attention yes , but it 's not being helpful for the spanish . 
   and assholes that think `` they have nothing to be protesting '' are the ones that are upset . 
  what do you mean by assholes and who 's upset about the spanish protesting ? 
  if anything , the protesting spanish are the ones who are upset , otherwise they would n't be protesting , would they ? 
  the government still did n't take the rest of his clothing . 
  i 'm almost always often with sneakers , jeans and a shirt or a sweatshirt . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
   `` only gays '' implies that `` real men '' would n't want to do that , hinting at a derogatory undertone for the word `` gay '' . 
  dude , it 's not like that , it 's that it 's quite gay to take such effort into clothing . 
  i also like to dress well when i can and get the chance , but browsing a reddit with such and name and all , do n't get me wrong , i have no problems at all , it 's just sounds like one does n't have its priorities set straight if he spends more time looking at clothes and how well they fit and not looking into , well , the ladies that do wear the really fancy clothes x ), 
   sorry , i do n't really care about my clothes at all , and besides , i 'm unemployed so i do n't really have money to spare with such fanciness :p, 
   so if i 'm looking for a deal on cheap armani suits , i should n't go to a subreddit where other people are looking for cheap armani suits because it 's gay . 
  i did n't say you should n't , i said it sounds gay .
