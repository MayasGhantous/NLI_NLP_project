  massive butthurt detected . 
   in all fairness , i was answering from the posting page and it does n't show flags ( your `` oink '' is n't exactly telling anyway ) . 
  wait , you do n't know my country based on its flag alone ? 
  oh god , are you really that ignorant ? 
  xd  so to assume that it would be a french guy getting all puffed up is n't that much of a leap . 
  yeah , i 'm not , sorry for making you look like a ginormous twat . 
   so if you were french , you would say that it 's ok for your mags to mock muslims , but it 's not ok to mock you ? 
  or that it 's not ok to mock anybody , because we 're all such special snowflakes ? 
  it 's ok to mock everything , though if you try to mock anyone and end up just being unfunny , lame or outright wrong , just do n't bitch about it when people point out how stupid it is . 
  saying the french are always surrendering is as historically accurate as saying the english hate tea and in this case , you spammed it like a lot of american ignorants . 
  congrats , you 're almost as funny as 9gag . 
   it surely depends on the circumstances , but why not ? 
  i guess it 's fine to laugh at farts if you 're 12 , though i wonder how a kid your age got into r/europe . 
   where did you get the idea that i hate the french ? 
  for someone who mistakes me for a french and asks me `` how about you give me you address and i send you a german flag to burn ? 
  '' , you 're certainly incredibly considerate for them . 
   how is my translation incorrect i did n't say that . 
   but i do hate douchebags that have almost the same sense of humor as the muslims we 're discussing here . 
  given the topic , one should find that rather ironic , do n't you think ? 
  yes , ironic , let me just attack your embassy because you 've repeated the same historically innacurate french jokes for the millionth time so we go full circle . 
  the funniest part is when you compare french military jokes with a sense of humour . 
  but i get your kind , you probably also laugh out loud when someone farts or burps - if you think that 's funny , go right ahead and spam fart and burp jokes all over the internet as well . 
   french people fought long and hard against christianity a lot of christian clerics also had `` long and hard '' experiences with french youths . 
   my french is not that good for someone who apparently [ hates the french ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/104h6x/french_magazine_plans_to_publish_new_mohammed/c6af1h3?context=3 ) , you 're quite pathetic . 
   that when french decided to attack libya because they wanted it 's oil , you had to attack libya with them on the contrary , we and many others would just veto the french proposed intervention . 
   that if some big eu country decided that angola should not be allowed to invest in europe , your country would be completly fucked again , we and others would be able to veto it . 
   because who gives a shit about 10 million people in a corner of europe . 
  you say that as if we were irrelevant in eu terms and as if europe was out to get us and their objectives were directly the opposite of our objectives . 
  no and no , we are quite relevant in eu terms specially if you consider the influence we have with our former colonies ( in the world , there are more portuguese speakers than french and german speakers combined ) and the objectives of the member-states are very identical in terms of foreign relations ( we 'd even be a stronger force for peace , freedom and democracy if we were together and some member-states were then more shielded from us influence ) . 
  [ muhammed is n't happy . 
   so , seeing as the ( typically wimpy ) french is already planning to close all their embassies except in monaco , i guess it 's ok after all  typically wimpy french ? 
  you have no fucking clue about french history . 
  oh , and it 's a bit redundant for them to have an embassy in monaco . 
   american observer what do they know ? 
  yes , i agree with you , the problem is that this massive debt has to be dealt with immediately and no solution is good enough , we have to choose the least-bad option and it 's proving immensely difficult . 
  it 's the worst part , knowing the problems , knowing exactly why the things being done to fix it will have harmful secondary effects but it being too late to delay the problems even further and nobody having actual measures to fix the issue which would n't leave significant fallout of their own .

  the shrink greece will suffer is artificial in the sense that the money should have never been there in the first place , it was government spending whose returns were n't enough to cover the investment . 
  example , imagine that portugal borrowed millions and invested them in football fields for a sport event and that afterwards these football fields were left abandoned - the portuguese gdp would indeed grow millions when the football fields were being built but when the loans had to be paid with the interest and you had 0 $ from returns from said football fields , the economy would then shrink those millions and some more which would be the interest . 
  it would only serve to make farage go more apeshit . 
  this . 
  portugal is a long-standing ally of england / uk and , in international affairs , pretty much always stands by its former colonies . 
  we 're neutral in the sense that we do n't go around looking for conflicts but we 're not neutral in the sense that we avoid taking a stance in international affairs , in that case , it 's as i said , pro-uk , pro-eu and pro-portuguese speaking countries . 
  as of now , we do n't even have a functional army . 
  so yeah , i have no problems with an european army . 
  even if it was `` dictated '' by the french and germans . 
   to a nice cup of tea and an aspirin , for the masses . 
  i like my tea and aspirin as i like my religion , relaxing and sexually abusing children . 
   do n't you think there are some more profound differences between portugal and poland than , say , north carolina and oregon ? 
  european countries are several centuries old ( sometimes thousands ) . 
  i 'm all for a close-alliance , i even like the unified military , but i do n't think we should be completely americanized . 
  i agree with you , the differences between states might be greater but with regards to defence , i see no reason for them to get in the way of full-blown cooperation . 
  a unified military , it 's what we 're arguing for . 
  not americanized , of course , ours will never be a military that will be invading or threatening to invade countries left and right . 
   we should maintain separate foreign policies without getting into conflict . 
  it 's a more beneficial arrangement that 's the thing , we do n't get to choose both , we either act together or we do n't , separate foreign policies with the same military are n't an option . 
  considering we 're already as one with regards to borders or tariffs , i say foreign policy is the logical next step . 
   do you think portug ** u ** ese or irish , czechs any of us will be allowed in the european foreign ministry ? 
  do n't you think the pan-european foreign ministry will be almost entirely composed of french , germans , and perhaps poles ? 
  would you like your foreign policy dictated as such ? 
  unless there are national quotas i ca n't support this again , i see no problems with this , the interest of the whole union would be better achieved and it would never be detrimental to any particular member-state . 
  it 's not like the brazilian military is harmful to rio grande do norte interests or the russian military is harmful to kamchatka , so why would the european military be harmful to say slovenia or denmark ? 
  national quotas would be silly imo , though i 'd get it if they were implemented . 
  unlike ireland , portugal is n't neutral , we 're actually strongly pro-uk , pro-eu and pro-cplp . 
  we just have our military almost dismantled as we no longer need it and it 's an expense so we do n't venture off in wars , we now are often just are part of the peacekeeping and rebuilding process . 
   yes , but i do n't think sweden , austria and finland are as supportive of going abroad with the us/uk/france or whomever who initiates the next iraq/we have to defend our oil/we have to defend our islands for strategic sheep reasons , as some other countries ( i know sweden would n't ) then joining our forces with countries who seem to be certainly not militant , but far more militant than we are ( which is fairly easy ) is a major hurdle . 
  that 's the thing , if we were together , we would n't have member-states being `` influenced '' to help do the usa 's dirty-work , we 'd rather just deal with our own issues and let them do their thing alone . 
  that would most definitely mean there would n't be eu troops in any of those theatres as several member-states would most likely veto it and we 'd be much more shielded to being more like pawns to other superpowers . 
   also , why are they doing this now ? 
  sigh , the eurozone is breaking up/falling apart etc , and personally , i do not want to join in any sort of deal , closer cooperation until the countries involved actually care about following treaties , laws and regulations , which none of the big countries , apart from britain is doing . 
  they simply do not care . 
  what says they are not going to break the next treaty ? 
  `` the eu is going to collapse !!! '', 
  yeah , that 's not going to happen . 
  i do n't think it 's that bad , one of the criticisms of the eu is that when there 's an outside problem that affects europe , cameron says one thing , hollande other and merkel yet another , which does n't lead to any increased benefits in the particular member-states and is harmful to the whole union . 
  if you compared it with say the usa or brazil , it would be unthinkable that their states would have different stances with regards to foreign affairs . 
  i never bitch about portugal and i never left it . 
   have a good day . 
  thanks . 
  have a nice one as well . 
  where did i hate on anyone ? 
  it was an honest question , why do you have to think i 'm an hateful person ? 
  it 's also texas , your argument is invalid . 
   nyt sorry , i do n't give a fuck about europe seen from a fat self-centred american perspective, 
  lol u suck, 
  portugal is n't western europe ? 
  it 's only the westernmost country in europe , both mainland and not . 
  wow , how can you be so dumb ? 
  i mean , it 's one thing to be a communist but it 's even worse to not know geography . 
   solution : kick out muditerraneans piiggs and create a glorious northern europe union . 
  kick us out , i fucking dare you . 
  i 'll fucking move there , refuse to learn the language , fuck your women , live on welfare and cry about discrimination so much that you 'll regret the day you gave up on me . 
  http://i.imgur.com/bzwmu.jpg that feel when i purify northern women with our superior genes . 
  you should just [ let it go ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlhtng1rxmk ) . 
  fuck , i mean : oink ? 
  go back to r/9gag, 
   if there is something that every culture can agree with , is that ** roma culture ** is just objectively wrong . 
  roma culture ? 
   i honestly do n't understand the gypsie culture . 
  gypsies have a culture ?
