  being asshole criminals is now a culture ? 
  you blow , fatty .

  yes , you 're an entitled asshole , we get it . 
   the federation that no one wants ? 
  opinions . 
  so you do n't live in romania and yet you bitch about it . 
  you 're pathetic . 
  how about somalia ? 
  can i get a visa there by investing 1.000.000 somalian shillings ? 
  it could be funny getting a somalian citizenship for only 37 $ . 
  texas sucks . 
  what about trannies , shemales and eunuchs ? 
  also , brussels is misogynistic because a 40 % quota is retarded when women make up  50 % of the population . 
  ok , now more seriously , what a retarded proposal . 
  you ca n't force equality and it 's certainly not the government 's role to decide whom one should employ . 
  protip for the actual ft : make your website available to all as you 're just driving people away with the registrations . 
   the world all unicorns and rainbows you need to drop the acid . 
  that argument of `` there are n't many women in leading positions '' is bollocks for two reasons , firstly nothing stops them for reaching the top positions ( here in europe we even have several women as leaders of government ) and secondly because the companies in which there are a clear lack of women in leading positions are also the companies were the leaders are all aged people and indeed , back when they were young the education and the culture was different . 
  as time goes by and the current people retire and younger people take their places there will eventually be gender equality as the new generations had the same education for both men and women . 
  oh , and `` positive '' discrimination is still discrimination and only serves to further the stereotypes . 
  what 's next , you want to increase the price of condoms 10 times for whites and make them free for blacks so that you make the aids rate similar regardless of ethnicity ? 
  gtfo . 
  awful read , i ca n't stand whiners . 
  by that logic , the usa should n't have bothered when japan bombed pearl harbour , after all , it was just some islands in the middle of the ocean with just a few dudes living there , no ? 
  dude , i 'm making an honest question , not a political statement . 
  what about that man ? 
  if by opinions you mean the burning of flags , the harassment of police officers and death threats to diplomats , you have a weird sense of what consists an opinion . 
   i just want to tell them to `` go fuck yourself '' , and send these extremists back to where they came from , where they can run around screaming `` jihad '' as much as they want . 
  but we are better than them , and wont . 
  that 's why we are civilized , and the extremists are n't . 
  so we 're civilized because we 're pushovers ? 
  this is ana drago . 
  your czech politician ladies have nothing on her . 
  it 's just that them titties . . :o, 
  you created an account for this ? 
   except for in informatik . 
  there we made a lan party in the school  back in school , we had plenty of lan parties , not only in inform\u00e1tica but also in other classes that required computers . 
  i miss those times , cs 1.6 was awesome and it was even better if it was played when you were meant to be in class !, 
  reddit , why do you love nuclear so much ? 
  why do n't you consider cleaner alternatives like solar and wind an option as well ? 
  did you know that `` hotel '' is the same in portuguese and in dutch ? 
  that `` t\u00e1xi '' is `` taxi '' and that `` anan\u00e1s '' is `` ananas '' ? 
  omg :o, 
  the problem is n't their justice system , it 's their immigration policies . 
  the only difference is that this was n't some stupidity done at a wedding , it was indiscriminate murder of westerns all around the world because of a clip a guy in his basement uploaded onto youtube . 
  [ martin schulz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_schulz ) is n't just `` one fucking guy '' . 
   i do n't really care if the portuguese fish in norwegian waters damn straight , if you do n't like your [ cod ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacalhau ) , we 'll gladly take it !, 
  damn muslims . 
  too similar to brazil 's hue . 
   politicians are actually humans . 
  yeah , i try not to state my mind on this issue as it 's a controversial subject . 
  you 'll likely get some grief out of that comment because there are hardly any argentinians here as opposed to british . 
  either way , who should own the islands is irrelevant to the subject at hand - in the eyes of the world , a nato country was attacked and had to deal with it without direct support of other alliance members . 
  goes to show how nato is all about everyone helping the usa and not everyone helping everyone . 
  if we had an european army , we could properly use it to defend our european interests and not having to rely on our interests being shared by the usa for help . 
  according to wikipedia :  a federation , also known as a federal state , is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions united by a central ( federal ) government . 
  in a federation , the self-governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , are typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of the latter . 
  there will be referendums . 
   the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail .

   the title of this post fills me with rage and hate . 
  sound 's like you have a short fuse , a simple grammar mistake is enough to fill you with `` rage and hate '' ? 
   i just checked bmw homepage in portugal , your car prices seem to be same as in here , so yes , you are right , there is hardly room to move on there . 
  you forgot to consider that your purchasing power is much higher there , if the cars cost the same in portugal as they do in finland , then they 're comparatively much more expensive here - your gdp ( ppp ) is about 50 % higher than ours , so i guess that 's more arguments for the lowering of taxes here rather than an increase of them . 
   just a question , are car taxes calculated based on emissions , so low emissions toyota 's get smaller taxes than more polluting bmw 's ? 
  i do n't know for sure , but i would n't be too surprised . 
  though since now all cars must have unleaded gasoline , i 'm sure the differences between the pollution are vestigial . 
  again , i 'm not really sure of these as i do n't have a car nor do i have knowledge of these laws . 
   if even the troika things that these should be renegotiated then that is definitely what should be done . 
  i myself was more afraid that renegotiating them would undermine portugal 's reputation as a trusted place where to invest , but as there seems to be no question that these should n't be renegotiated , then that should be done . 
  i would n't say the agreement with the international partners needs to be renegotiated , that would harm us more than it could possibly benefit us . 
  what needs to be renegotiated is these ppps which are very unfair to the state ( aka , to the taxpayer ) and the justice system needs to be significantly improved , so cases of corruption like several which are now coming to light get solved much faster and efficiently . 
  he did n't call anyone fascist and he himself said this crisis [ radicalised his left views ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/x1wf4/how_has_the_financial_crisis_effected_you/c5ikn0t ) .

  what a great way to ask for solutions while giving none . 
  the solutions are known - reduce public spending , try to reduce taxes ( or at least never raise them ) , improve business conditions and attract foreign investment , liberalise the job market and simplify the tax codes - now we just need to get around to implement them . 
  nato did wonders for the uk when argentina invaded the falklands . 
  russia invading the baltic sounds unlikely . 
  how about turkey and cyprus ? 
  they 've stated time and time again that they do n't recognize them as a sovereign nation , not even when they assumed the presidency of the council of europe . 
  besides , from what i hear from people living there , they quite often play around as the regional player they are and get jet fighters to fly over them , in a pathetic display of superiority . 
  a single military would be a perfect way to stop that bs , i seriously doubt they 'd try to pull that shit if we outnumbered and outgunned them massively . 
  countvontroll for emperor . 
   that 's another name for capitalism , minus the technology fetishism that you have in northern europe/some parts of the us . 
  the masochism of southern countries , in love with euro and a system that provably destroys them mesmerises me . 
  yes , capitalism bad , communism good . 
  i bet you mourn the day of the fall of the gdr . 
   most eastern and southern european countries have sub-subsistence wages . 
  expected massive falls in life expectancy . 
  lenin please , people are not going to die because of a reduction in minimum wage . 
  if anything , it 's only going to lower youth unemployment . 
   my medicine to get back on growth track would be to ...   * tear down labour laws , when you make firing easy you make hiring easier . 
   * tear down bureaucracy , starting a new joint stock company should n't take more than two days , and operating one should be as easy as possible . 
   * put more money on bringing foreign direct investment into the country , and give more support for export companies to expand in the continent and oversees .
