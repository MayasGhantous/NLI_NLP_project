  i find it most amusing that he finds it was the west that lead to the fall of yugoslavia and it 's us the ones to be blamed for their misery . 
  not communism and the central planning , not their dictatorship regime , not forcing different people to live together , no , it was the west and the its banks . 
  no sugar ? 
  fuck me that 's alpha !, 
  right , the people might stay . 
  their money certainly does not . 
  not if they value their wealth , i mean , rich people tend to do that ( otherwise they would n't be rich ) . 
  10/10 - would laugh again, 
  why the heck would you want high taxes ? 
  also , it 's kinda funny that you think that you can starve out switzerland or that they 're the only tax haven around . 
   edit : downvote really ? 
  complaining about downvotes is like complaining about the rain , no matter how you object it , they 're inevitable . 
  the only difference is that , unlike rain , downvotes are irrelevant . 
  hopefully if equal taxation in europe is ever implemented in europe , it will be a low rate . 
  that or the swiss will get even more stinking rich . 
  the only difference is that what i posted was n't copypasta , it was an actually reply i got when messing with a greek ultranationalist . 
  i 'll tell you , that pavlos is comedy gold . 
   i remember just weeks ago when the french posters on / r/europe were saying some french redditors do n't speak for all of france . 
   the rich will stay in france due to patriotic reasons people who are smart enough to get rich and remain rich are n't stupid enough to lose money over `` i was born here so i 'll keep my money here regardless of how much i end up paying in taxes '' . 
  right , however we 're all eu citizens , the borders have been open for decades , there 's a free market and millions travel , work and live in other countries than the one they were born . 
  one shutting himself off from the rest of europe would be suicide , one actually declaring war on another european nation would be inconceivable . 
  the very fact we 're actually discussing the possibility of war is laughable and i honestly think that people who say with a serious face that we 're walking towards a third european war need to get their brain checked .

  it would be fun to watch , considering none of us has any significant military . 
  hey , i can almost see my house !, 
  probably because most people who do not donate blood do n't do it because they 're ca n't . 
  besides , donating blood does n't give priority in extreme cases so no lives are at risk - someone who donated blood and is now needing a blood transfusion but without any eminent life risk is n't going to skip ahead of a guy who never donated blood but now had a serious accident and needs blood immediately . 
  it 's just a small benefit , it 's more like a token of appreciation rather than anything else . 
  poland must not be a country for people with an allergy to chocolate .

  :d brb , going to proclaim the republic of dave !, 
   wurst or k\u00e4sesemmeln such a fancy way of saying bread with ham or bread with cheese . 
  donating blood should be its own reward . 
  here in portugal , iirc , if you donate blood , you get priority in case you require a blood transfusion , though i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  one thing i do know is that you ca n't be paid for donating blood and you wo n't have to pay for a blood transfusion . 
  so for example if i lived there , i would be able to declare independence for my house and declare it a sovereign nation provided that independence was the will of the people living in my house ?

  wow , i do n't know where you got such excitement from nuclear but you have it !, 
  indeed , appropriate username , but you might have played a little bit too much of fallout , i 'm going to go on a limb here and say that the average man is n't that comfortable with nuclear tech . . as for the radioactive natural parks , surely keeping humans at bay by radiation is the worst possible way of balancing the ecosystem , is n't it ? 
  why are you so supportive of nuclear ? 
  i mean , one thing is to say they 're safe , there 's no serious risk of meltdown and the radioactive was is carefully disposed off , another is to say it would be ok to get nuclear waste in our backwards so we could heat the water !,

  it 's protectionism and within a free market should be abolished . 
  from now on , it should be ` made in europe ' . 
  i mean , our governments should really get their priorities straight , being in a free market and paying for their membership but then wasting money on ads supporting the consumption of national products instead of european ones . 
  let the consumer decide and stop using tax payer 's funds to try to make up for the shortcomings of the national industries .
