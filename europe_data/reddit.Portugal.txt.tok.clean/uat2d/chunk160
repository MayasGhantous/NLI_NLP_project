  i had all of the americas , oceania and sub-saharan africa . 
  for what it 's worth , i agree with you . 
  if the situations were reversed , i 'm sure we 'd also be frustrated for having to be us to pay for the mismanagement of other countries . 
  [ soon . 
  i challenge you to find a pic similar to this one but with followers of another religion . 
  it was in r/history and here as well , i remember . 
  it however was a long time ago , something like an year or so , iirc . 
  there are some other historical mistakes , in the video portugal owns algarve in 1210 but actually it was only in 1250 that algarve was secured . 
  others are much more obvious , like france falling in 1939 . 
  [ an example of some muslim bosnians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rat1kthcgo0 ) . 
  clearly a tolerant bunch . 
  flame wars , eh ? 
  how about [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/wg38y/european_jewish_leaders_on_circumcision_ruling/c5d0snt ) ? 
  oh , and i do n't think i need that to be happy , i 'd probably just settle for money , health and companionship . 
  not dealing with england first is asking for trouble . 
  they do have a mission to take over ireland , if you let them fight you on their own terms , you 're in for a lot of problem . 
  heck , before that game i tried one as munster and i did n't even make it into 1401 , the english jumped me before and i had 8k manpower against a 18 doomstack , needless to say it was game over for me . 
  the trick seemed to be to block europe from getting into america and with a monopoly there you 'll have so many ducats , you 'll be able to support an insane army , there will be no stopping you . 
  just keep an eye out for iberia , if needed be dow them , seize their colonies if they start setting them up and see if you can white peace them . 
  once you control the atlantic islands and all the coastline , it 's much easier . 
   as a french , i 'm tired of the french-ridiculous-at-war jokes . 
  how could we have manage to keep and expand a territory with all those nasty neighbours , if we 'd have been such natural-born losers ? 
  do n't think for a second that americans talk for everybody else , just because you fell to germany in ww2 and you did n't joined their war in iraq they came to the retarded conclusion that you always surrender . 
  their knowledge of history is clearly lacking , as otherwise they would n't make such ignorant statements . 
  but then again , it was you who funded their independence movement because of your rivalry with the english . 
  so i guess it 's kinda your fault that they came into existence and if they decide to be ungrateful and joke about your military , that 's your problem . 
  :p now a bit more seriously , if you come across someone like that , show them [ a gif like this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yx0sg.gif ) , even if that does n't shut them , at least they might learn some history . 
  and you can always tell them that they 're the ones who are pussies because they always show up late and for the most part just hide in the other side of the ocean . 
  just do n't take their bs personally . 
  well , they kinda tried it when everything else started failing . 
  you know how it is with collapsing authoritarian regimes - they tend to go full retard mode when they know they fucked up , their vision will never come to fruition and that their days on earth are numbered . 
  vassalized electors will pretty much always vote for you and everyone in the pic was my vassal . 
  that game is a few months old , at the time i posted some pics to a forum , here 's the links if you want more screenshots from that game : [ part 1 ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=11474552&amp;postcount=4241 ) , [ part 2 ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=11474665&amp;postcount=4243 ) and [ part 3 ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=11511765&amp;postcount=4373 ), 
  you guys have nothing on the scots with their kilts . 
  i once formed the hre as ireland in d&t , how 's my map painting skills ? 
  hey , do n't blame me , i 'm just commenting on the prettiness of the borders . 
   i respectfully disagree . 
  it 's your problem if you disagree with facts . 
  from your very own source , here 's what it says next :  the habsburg king was the only element of connection between the multiple kingdoms and territories . 
  the institutions government and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other . 
  the alian laws ( leyes de extranjeria ) determined that the natural of one kingdom was a foreigner in all the other iberian kingdoms . 
  the term iberian union is a creation of modern historians . 
  you still want to teach me about my own country ? 
  yes , i 'm picking on you not because you 're whining about being a victim but because of the british flag next to your name . 
  what stereotypes ? 
  the beer , the big boobies and the nice cars ? 
  why are those considered shitty stereotypes ? 
  gro\u00dfdeutschland does make for some nice borders , let me tell you . 
  looks better on the map than the tiny germany they have today , no lebensraum at all , let me tell you . 
  [ german speaking people post 1945 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ihqja.gif ) [ the rivers in the 1st verse of their national anthem ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gdhtk.png ) i know people are going to think i 'm making a political statement here but i 'm just saying that looking at a map of [ kleinstaaterei ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hbiew.png ) makes one puke while looking at a map of [ gro\u00dfdeutschland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tp5ej.png ) is kinda nice , aesthetically speaking . 
  [ confirmation bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) is a tendency of people to favour information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses . 
  the same king can rule over different kingdoms . 
  that was what happened and it was similar to , for example , england and scotland being ruled by the same king before the act of union of 1707 . 
  again , this did n't mean that england stretched all the way to caithness even though the king who ruled in england was also the king that ruled in scotland . 
  my point is that while we had three kings shared with spain , portugal never disappeared from the map and it was never incorporated into spain at any point during those 60 years , which is exactly the mistake the map made . 
  oh , and please do n't embarrassing yourself teaching me about the history of my country . 
  i was talking about the turks wanted europe to themselves . 
  but i think you 're reading too much into my post , i wrote that without being serious . 
  portugal was never incorporated into spain , it was a personal union that lasted for 60 years . 
  if scotland was still distinguishable from england previous to 1707 and aragon is distinguishable from castile after 1469 , it 's nonsense to not be able to distinguish portugal from spain from 1580 to 1640 . 
  also , hre confirmed for not knowing how to blob . 
  their borders are uglier than [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kxxag.png ) monstrosity . 
  edit : [ siege of vienna ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vktza.jpg ) , we do not forgive , we do not forget . 
  it is my understanding that istanbul is just the turkish name for the greek constantinople . 
  it would be far worse if they went :  greece ? 
  macedonia . 
   about 65 % of istanbul do n't you mean constantinople ? 
  europe has had different meanings from time to time but saying azerbaijan or armenia are in europe is false , they are nowhere close to another european country other than russia , and russia itself is much more located in asia than in europe , so no , those are not in europe . 
  [ europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg ) [ asia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg ), 
  i 'm pretty sure the second pic ( only 3 seconds in ) is from portugal . 
  what happened between 2010 and now for pvda ( labour ) losing so much and sp ( socialist ) winning so much ? 
   prestigious universities almost never participate in erasmus no . 
  they 're still not europe . 
  they forgot to add `` and freeze to death '' . 
  so this means we should instead hate the spaniards ? 
  i 'm ok with this . 
  fuck them and their [ acts of faith ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autos-da-f%c3%a9 ) !, 
   and r/europe is quite anti-brit sometimes . 
  we all hate everybody . 
  do n't think you 're special . 
  and svalbard !!, 
  that would be too much for me . 
  i mean , if i was drunk , i certainly would n't like to be on reddit , there 's plenty of better things to do while intoxicated . 
  and being drunk on reddit is just asking for trouble , i 've done it once and woke up to [ 11 ] messages or something like that and it was too much , not something i 'd enjoy repeating . 
  still , it 's currently 3h50 here , so 4h50 there . 
  who 's online drunk at 4h50 on a saturday ? 
  it 's not even 4am here , dude !, 
  lol !, 
  too bad a lot of people still think that the exact opposite of that is the best solution . 
  you know how it is , systems so big create dependence and then the unions and others benefiting from the inflated government lobby their best to prevent the change required , even if sticking to the massive spending ends up leading to much more problems later in time . 
  this has been on the news for quite some time but yet nothing has happened . 
  sounds like bollocks to me . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90g0kyolr7m ), 
   any moment now they are going to realize that immigrants do n't drop gold when you kill them like in the games . 
  long story short , i have a bitch in my trunk , where should i dump her ? 
  turnusb confirmed for being a gypsie . 
   actual fascists in actual black shirts are waving swastikas and murdering ethnic minorities in athens actual murder is ` pretty accurate ' ? 
  so you do n't live in portugal and have n't lived here for some years . 
  anything more you want to pull out of your ass ? 
   his a libertarian troll mine what ?
