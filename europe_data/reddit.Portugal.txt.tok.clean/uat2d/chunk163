  nah , you 'll avoid the iceberg . 
  it would be so foolish for the germans to go `` overspending fucked the mediterranean countries - let 's try the same here ! '' . 
  though , hypothetically speaking , if the eu collapsed under its debt , there would be no uesr , he 'd instead go back to no eu , as it 's the common market keeping us together . 
  if that happened , god forbid , i 'd petition for annexation by the uk . 
  they 've always had our backs ( kinda ) and that way we 'd be safe and within a system that historically supported the free market and the values of democracy . 
  austerity is n't cutting back on necessary spending , it 's cutting back on the excesses , they 're doing that precisely to avoid being stuck in the same situation we were caught on . 
   if no one is spending money no one is earning money and your economy pretty much freezes like it 's happening right now . 
  you do n't need the government to do the spending for you . 
  that 's ludicrous , the government spending money here or there wo n't jump-start any economy , rational consumers do that , not hollande when he says he wants to increase the costs of firing people so that it gets more advantageous to not fire people , that 's the real recipe for disaster and that is the true race to the bottom , by making the industry uncompetitive and exporting all the job opportunities . 
   what we do n't need is europe wide austerity which makes it impossible for a country like ours to ever recover , even if we do all the necessary reforms , as all our main trading partners are n't buying the shit we make either . 
  germany not wasting money on unnecessary public infrastructure is n't what 's keeping us down . 
  it would n't be the consumer 's fault if our exports were n't competitive enough . 
  and , unlike you 're saying , [ our exports are growing . 
  ] ( http://economia.publico.pt/noticia/crescimento-das-exportacoes-estavel-em-fevereiro-1541354 )  there 's no reason for dutch ( or germans fwiw ) to be doing austerity and it puts the entire eurozone into a race to the bottom where we will all be living on 300 euros per month . 
  tell me exactly how the lack of austerity creates a race to the bottom . 
  by that logic , we should get s\u00f3crates back , he did exactly the opposite , by building stadiums , magalh\u00e3es and roads everywhere , we should be at the top , right ? 
  because you never had any problems with immigrants from islamic countries that does n't mean there is n't any . 
  [ sharia law in the uk ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16522447 ) [ muslim riots in germany ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uboizp02k8k ) [ islam in the media in sweden ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69be-7apera ) [ muslims praying in the street in france ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5iqou_s71o ) i 'm just saying , if they are to come here , it 's just reasonable that they adapt to our society and to integrate , not living as outcasts and expecting everyone else to do the adapting . 
   http://www.dw.de/image/0,,16190233_401,00.jpg yet portugal is n't mentioned in the article . 
  the crisis is already hitting germany . 
  it 's hitting us all , in fact , some worse than others but that 's because some were more unprepared than others . 
  my problem is with the people that think increased public spending is a solution when it 's just adding to the problem . 
  it 's no coincidence that some of the most affected countries had huge public spending without actual economical growth to show for it . 
  i 'm sorry , it 's that considering the amount of people here that seem so eager to ban those with whom they disagree and that even i was once temporary banned from here because i said `` nigger '' on snoonet.com makes me doubt the moderation team . 
  i mean , damn , i 've been here for more than an year [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hzgee/democratic_deficit_in_the_eu/ ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jp72q/rportugal_celebrates_its_1000th_reader/ ) and suddenly there 's these guys saying i 'm a nazi and this is some conspiracy and a mod like you saying you 're `` already clamping down '' makes me uneasy . 
  i might be a douche sometimes but i 'm not breaking the rules and i 'd hate to be banned from here , that 's all . 
   also there was a warning thread submitted by someone a few weeks back that neo-nazis would be targeting this subreddit . 
  i remember that thread , it was a subreddit with 6 people in it while r/europe has over 17k subscribers . 
  neo-nazis everywhere !, 
  wait , you 're going to be banning people based on `` offending comments '' ? 
  `` offensive '' is a very broad word , i might be offended with people who support higher taxes and more government intervention in the economy , should i report comments those who say these things too ? 
  iirc , offensive comments are n't against [ reddit 's rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) . 
  that map i just had laying around . 
  i 'm not scarred at all of chinese immigrants , they for one do n't pray on the middle of the streets , do n't try to impose chinese law here and do n't ask for different school curriculum or chinese only schools , unlike the muslims unfortunately do . 
  again , i do n't have any problem with any immigrants as long as they do n't have a problem with me . 
  if they want to come here , fine , just do n't live on welfare , do n't turn into criminals and overall do n't be an hassle to the rest of society . 
  that 's only fair to ask , is n't it ? 
  what 's up , comelli ? 
  ca n't i try to mess with the anti-austerity left-wing ? 
   some of the commenters there are : uat2d lol , i knew about that reddit through r/europe 's frontpage and i was there trolling the guy who made that subreddit . 
  not that i should have anything to prove but [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u0egf.png ) , that should be good enough to prove that this is n't some conspiracy , right ? 
  thankfully now people will stop calling others of nazis just because they disagree with them . 
  i suppose that could work as well , but we do need immigration if we want to renovate the generations and keep a competitive work force capable of sustaining our social welfare systems . 
  the problem is n't with immigration , it 's only with the lack of integration of some immigrants which lead to the conflicts we 're discussing here . 
  and so that 's why a simple `` no immigrants allowed '' is n't a solution for the problems of immigration . 
  edit :  ( at least not in such numbers ) yeah , or that . 
  while he was off-topic , i kinda agree with him : s sorry , i know how this grinds your gears , but being in his position and having to pay for the fuck ups of others certainly is n't nice . 
  besides , we do the exact same whenever madeira gets portugal deeper in debt . 
   ( 8 | 7 ) that 's hardly upvoted . 
  i 've never said it was simple , but it 's better than nothing , right ? 
  and the problem is that , so far , that 's exactly what we 've been doing , nothing , so no wonder we 're having problems , both with the immigrants and those who were already here . 
  no wonder stuff like `` racism and xenophobia still prevalent '' makes the news , we 're not dealing with the issue at all !, 
  what the fuck ? 
  first france and now the netherlands ? 
  fucking save us , germany !, 
   `` supports some degree of immigration restrictions ''   `` racist cunt '' stay classy , reddit . 
  yes , outrageous that we should n't allow all muslims to gather up in slums and instead are trying to integrate them with the rest of society . 
  i 'm sorry , i just do n't want to live in an [ european caliphate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zls4j.png ) . 
  if some restrictions to immigration are too much for you , then i guess you 'll at least have the support of the muslim crowd with whom you 'll soon be living with . 
  i did n't say nothing about forcibly moving the population , i 'm saying when they arrive , you tell them where to go . 
  but i 'm guessing any solution is too drastic for you , ignoring the problem will make it go away , right ? 
   what the tea party says in lies about mexicans is the roma gypsy reality . 
  not really , i 've never seen a roma gypsy stealing a job . 
  in fact , i wish they stole jobs than actually stealing . 
  fucking good for nothing gypsies , it 's like they 're proud of not integrating and being literally stinking criminals . 
   `` reverse '' racism how does that work ? 
  do you tell minorities that they are awesome or do you tell the majority to go back to their own country ? 
   specially in that bavaria region or whatever it is called perhaps they `` harassed '' you not because of the colour of your skin but because of that fucking attitude , no ? 
   `` so i 'm black and i 've been to some place or whatever it is called and at the train station people even asked for my passport !! '', 
  go cry racism elsewhere . 
  for a second there i thought he wanted to ban both islam and the deportation of fanatics . 
  while we 're on topic , would n't it just be much easier to not allow them to gather up and live in segregated communities ? 
  i 'm thinking , if you get 100 or so muslims together in sweden or in any country , they 'll live just like they did back in backwardistan . 
  however , if you limit the number of muslims in a community , say not more than 10 muslims in a town of ~ 1000 people , wo n't they do their very best to integrate with the rest of society ? 
  while that might not be relevant to the topic of racism and xenophobia , damn , it 's true and it hit close to home . 
  for what it 's worth it , trust me , you probably hate those governments less than we do , they were much more harmful to us than they were to you . 
  i wish i could ride a bike to university and listen to electro all day every day like in the beautiful country of the netherlands . 
  sorry i could n't be of more help . 
  i 've never been to sweden myself , so i doubt if i should even be talking , considering i 'm not exactly an expert . 
   but it is pretty good if you want to study , considering college and whatnot is free , you only pay for the school material you 'd need and rent ( where you in most cases would get help from the government with ) . 
  you need to be a swedish national to get those benefits . 
  so it 's a bad idea to advertise your country based on that . 
  btw , even portugal has education free till the 12th grade and while college is n't free , it 's very inexpensive , i pay 1000 $ / year on tuition fees , i 'm guessing this for you is dirt cheap . 
  geez , reddit , [ here 's a picture of mogadishu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/aerial_view_of_a_us_helicopter_as_it_flies_over_a_mogadishu_residential_area.jpeg ) and [ here 's a picture of stockholm ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/stockholm-altstadt-%28gamla-stan%29.jpg ) . 
  are they even remotely the same ? 
  damn , why ca n't you get sarcasm ? 
  i was just joking a bit and not related to the topic . 
  in fact , if you talk education , portugal is in a pretty bad spot - for example , talking literacy , we 're [ the worst country in all of the eu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/worldmapliteracy2011.png ) . 
  this is because till 74 , education was mostly neglected and we still have a lot of old people who did n't had proper education . 
  but that 's besides the point , i was just teasing with fukenhippie and going against the wave , as americans and a lot of reddit seems to have unrealistic expectations about sweden , thinking it 's some sort of utopia with no flaws whatsoever . 
   i would love to live there if i had the opportunity .
