  i was just telling you why that would be a bad idea . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  somalia is almost in a better situation than sweden , they both are filled with militant blacks and religious extremists but at least in somalia you have good weather . 
  same thing with portugal and the people born and raised just after the revolution . 
  here in portugal , yes , the stupid yokels in alentejo are so dumb that they tend to always vote communist . 
  here 's some elections we 've had here in the recent past with maps showing the most voted party and second most voted party by district . 
  orange means centre-right , pink means socialist and red means communist .

  because it 's in sweden . 
  til germany is a dictatorship . 
   if fines were fixed , you could do whatever you wanted to if you could afford it . 
  fines have a cap here and nobody does whatever they want , regardless if they can afford it or not . 
  you 're racist as shite !, 
  you 're right , we do need better regulation to avoid precisely that . 
   pretty sure that constantly saying `` pay your debts '' to greek people is harassment/bullying `` pay your debts '' is harassment or bullying ? 
  are you serious ? 
  is n't there still some bad blood between you two ? 
  the balkans still seem a mess to me , at least whenever i talk with serbs online it 's always `` srbija stronk '' and other kinds of nationalism blown out of proportion . 
  from what i read here , ron paul should be the us president . 
  from what i read on youtube , ukip will win the next british elections . 
  from what i read on portuguese news , the next government will be socialist . 
  yet none of these things will happen . 
  society is broader and more complex than that . 
  the pros and cons of the euro are not something that can be easily explained in a few sentences , so i 'll just state that a single currency is a good thing because different currencies are a restriction to the free market . 
  could you please provide a loose translation ? 
  dude , fuck you , you 're too tiresome , even when i agree with you , you go on and say that i do n't and that instead my beliefs are this and that . 
  dude , it 's just a name , going all `` oh my , a guy compared some countries to a pig , he must be punished ! '', 
  is just plain stupid . 
  the person who first came up with it ? 
  we do n't know . 
  the amount of people who used it in a serious conversation ? 
  innumerable , the term had widespread usage a couple of years ago . 
  does any of this matter ? 
  not at all , what is this , the `` good manners police '' ? 
  portugal pig , spain bull , france chicken , germany dog , poland horse . 
  there , i just associated the name of european countries with random animals . 
  if i offended anyone , i 'm terrible sorry . 
   who came up with that stupid and degrading acronym anyway ? 
  [ the term has been used since at least the mid-1990s as an epithet referring to portugal , italy , greece and spain noted for similar economic environments . 
  the term became popularized by the wider media during the european sovereign debt crisis , including alternatives such as portugal , ireland , greece and spain \\ ( pigs \\ ) and portugal , ireland , italy , greece and spain ( piigs ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_%28economics%29 )  but some sort of a reprimand would be in place . 
  no , it would n't . 
  it 's called free speech . 
  besides , it would be hypocritical to say stupid shit about others and asking for reprimands when others say stupid shit about us , regardless if either side actually means it or not . 
  we 're all grown ups here , no need for `` mommy , he said bad things , punish him !, 
  '' , that would be retarded . 
  hey , do n't ask me , i certainly did n't came up with the acronyms . 
  the whole issue is now losing its initial meaning with people adding letters and such , sayings piiggs just makes you look like you 'd stutter or that your keyboard is acting up . 
  if i was a condescending asshole from some other country , even i would n't say pigs any more . 
  saying things like `` x country is doing its homework '' , for example , sounds much more douchy imo . 
  you 're right , it 's [ poe 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) . 
  though i still try to give it away , not even the most fucked up guy would say things like `` nuke mecca 2012 '' . 
  sorry , i did n't mean to scary you , i was just trying to mock extremists by acting like them :( and this is why i 'm such a lousy troll , i never commit myself . .  shameful/10, 
  because of the acronym pigs under which my country is in . 
  so when people mention pigs , i go with the joke and oink oink oink oink . 
  if you 're curious about how i changed this , it 's very easy , just request a flair and then change the name of the country to the word you want and that 's it . 
  we have [ two autonomous regions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_regions_of_portugal ) with their own governments and our president represents us all . 
  but regardless , if the us president does n't represent its citizens but rather the states , why the universal suffrage ? 
  i 'm sorry if i find this truly mind-boggling . 
  lol , no need to apologize , i also act dickish quite often x ), 
  so a few senators in florida are worth more than 450.000 electors . 
  and the uk complains about the eu being undemocratic . 
  god forbid we end up a `` democracy '' like this . 
  in portugal , to be president , you need at least  50 % of the valid votes . 
  first there 's an election between all contenders and if in that election there is n't anyone with a majority of the votes , then there 's an election between the two most voted candidates . 
  anyway this is irrelevant because what we 're discussing is how you can win an elections by having less votes than your opponent . 
   young muslim men in germany are systematically trying to recruit their peers for jihad fucking mudslimes , they want holy war , they 've got it !, 
  til it 's ok to let the guy with less votes get to president of the fucking usa . 
  you 're right , why bother with the vote count , like he holds any power . 
  nope , i was talking about how a guy with 47.9 % of the popular vote gets to be president and his opponent , with 48.4 % , does not . 
  according to wikipedia :  democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives . 
  so , i 'll say it again :  america `` democracy '' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sprsuax5j78, 
  til 50,456,002 is more than 50,999,897 . 
  it 's not against the [ rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) . 
   this video ( spanish only though ) shows that the lady did have the permission no , it does n't show that . 
  the lady said that she was restoring it for years and that nobody forbidden her . 
  basically nobody said anything . 
   thank you for you participation . 
  btw , i told them that my opinion regarding the eu is `` domewhat positive '' :p, 
   your logic that the eu stopped wars just because there have n't been any wars since the eu was created is equally flawed . 
  i was talking not only about the eu but also about the eec and the ecsc . 
  i thought you wanted all european cooperation gone . 
   remain competitive ? 
  the eu 's straightjacket is making us less competitive . 
  in fact , that 's the major cause of the current crisis - an inability to adapt to a modern globalised world . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's a free market , by standardising the rules and laws , you get more competitive , not less . 
  had everyone followed the same strict financial regulations , for example , we 'd be much more competitive now and not facing these issues . 
   let 's start with restrictive labour laws and frankly insane health and safety regulations . 
  a lot of those regulations are oecd and they apply to everyone . 
  and a lot of those are blown out of proportion on british media . 
  [ see this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqvjeznyizo ), 
   the maastricht treaty was created in 1993 . 
  so the eu should n't be scrapped , we just ought to go back to the eec ? 
   now , integration has caused more conflict , has created a depression in many of the member states , and has caused the rise of extremist political parties in several member states . 
  no , just because a happened and then b happened , that does n't mean b happened because of a. 
  this is the case , the eu has n't been harmful to europe , not in this sense . 
   why not look at some other countries that are not in the eu , norway and switzerland , for instance ... 
  it 's always those two examples , but norway has oil and switzerland has jew gold .
