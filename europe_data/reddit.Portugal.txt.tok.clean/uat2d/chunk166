  you 're right , from [ the pm s\u00f3crates mistakenly saying he 's sure immigrants will do their best for a poorer country ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vahq0zrqse ) to [ president cavaco actually saying he wo n't be able to cover his expenses when he retires ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvgtja594e8 ) , one ca n't really laugh at these , they 're more depressing than funny . . 
  you do n't need an hour long video to demonstrate his awful english and how other leaders just laughed it off . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbqomlvq8oy ) , a 0:46 video . 
  also a fail by rtp , in the beginning it reads on top `` s\u00f3crates - presidente da uni\u00e3o europeia '' ( literally , president of the eu ) . 
  but i guess they have a bad record at [ that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/y9zzj/hoje_%c3%a0_noite_no_telejornal_pareceme_bem/ ) ( the caption reads `` 6 times the speed of light '' ) . 
  i for one support the british police , these trollers have gone way out of hand . 
  i 'm very thankful for these police officers enforcing good manners on all citizens so that my children can safely browse the web and not be exposed to anything that might harm them . 
   all nations and parties have bad politicians , but what are your worst horror stories ? 
  when [ m\u00e1rio soares ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a1rio_soares ) handed our empire to the ussr-funded terrorists in the colonies and millions of portuguese were left on their luck , forcing millions to come back to portugal with absolutely nothing , and also destabilizing these regions ( which could have been federalized instead of handed over to militias and warlords considering that most of the people there were portuguese ) , making them lose all their skilled labour and public services and investments and making them go through decades of civil war , and these still are nowadays under oppressive systems , with the exception of east timor which was invaded by indonesia and tens of thousands were mercilessly tortured , raped and slaughtered , having only very recently acquired independence . 
  do note that m\u00e1rio soares himself took off from mozambique with diamonds and when asked by these militias about what to do with the portuguese who where left , he answered '' [ throw them at the sharks ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpoliticaportugal.wordpress.com%2ftag%2fatira-los-aos-tubaroes%2f&amp;act=url ) '' . 
  [ also his overall shit socialist policies and craziness which have ever since dragged us down . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqxpwn9zjk )  i feel that this subreddit is a bit too serious sorry for being too serious , so here 's another one , this one lighter : when [ dur\u00e3o barroso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dur%c3%a3o_barroso ) left portugal for the eu commission , his government collapsed and the portuguese elected socialist [ jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_s%c3%b3crates ) in 2005 and let him in power till 2011 . http://i.imgur.com/vzmpm.png,

  sasp777 , as a bolshevik yourself , do you support militant anti-theism by the state ?

   i wonder if this is pressure from ` the system ' or just new insights from an unique position that leaves a smaller array of choices than campaign talk would suggest .

  that 's what i get for posting at 3am gmt time xd, 
   we could make the europe the place where monotheistic religions come to die . 
  kinda pointless after having spread christianity pretty much all over the world . 
   2 muslim colleagues that does n't mean anything , there are good people and assholes everywhere . 
  just because you have two muslim friends that are n't radical does n't mean that there are no problems of muslim radicalism in europe . 
   i know / r/europe consists of only the best and brightest [ you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fis4a.jpg ) . 
  achas-me bonita ? 
   a problem we have in europe is that there are too many people who want to alienate immigrants , especially muslims . 
  which leads to extremism , crime and slums . 
  if we can make immigrants feel more welcome then many of the problem should be solved by themselves . 
  that just demonstrates how naive you are . 
  it 's not society that has to adapt to its immigrants , it 's the immigrants that have to adapt to their new society . 
  people have alienated immigrants all over history and for the most part , those who integrated where those who seriously made an effort to adapt to their new country 's culture . 
  it was never the other way around and it 's certainly not the average swede 's fault that immigrants from africa shut themselves in slums and live as outcasts . 
   i do n't know much about canada but it seems that their attitude is very different from our 's and their integration is successful . 
  canada deports everyone over anything . 
  the other day there was on the news that they were going to deport a portuguese who was living there for 32 years and had a job and a whole family ( wife , 4 children and 2 grandchildren all with canadian citizenship ) all because his papers did n't came through and he was technically illegal . 
  stories like this are common . 
  their socialists even made [ spoof videos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv_ixcnroh0 ) about this . 
  still , it 's not worse than when they deport boers who lived there all their lives to south africa . 
  so yeah , canada 's `` successful integration '' is because they 're so strict and closed , not because they 're open-minded and welcomed . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7csudpyeu9w ), 
   but there are other religions in europe like christianity which mandates for children to be put to death if they curse at their parents . 
  in fact read chapter 20 of leviticus . 
  the thing is , no christians ( at least in europe ) do that . 
  the same ca n't be said about muslims ( and jews for that matter ) that still try to enforce genital mutilation , for example . 
  if you 're just going to shout racism when people mention that some assholes use religion as an excuse to act as barbarians , then you 're not helping , you 're just ignoring the problem . 
   every dutch person i know so a couple of dutch people agree with you ? 
  [ because muslims are not the problem . 
  i do n't speak a word of swedish and i 've never been to sweden but from what i hear , you do are having some problems regarding immigration and political correctness getting in the way of discussing your problems . 
  as a swede , could you please give me your thoughts on [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69be-7apera ) ? 
  that last one reminded me of cod4 fucking niggers over at iw, 
   is every portuguese really that dense ? 
  tagged as racist , downvoted , reported , called the feds , may god have mercy on us all !, 
   lel why ? 
   [ reddit rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) nope , sorry , there 's nothing there regarding racism . 
  if you do n't like when people criticize or `` offend '' others , then downvote and move on , do n't call out for bans just because you disagree with them . 
   xenophobia is defined as an ** irrational ** dislike or fear of people from other countries there 's plenty of rational reasons to not like gypsies . 
  i had that image laying around , i do n't create content , sorry . 
   banning people because they say things you disagree with for someone who apparently is so worried about racism , you sound a lot like a bigot, 
   latin american for latins good luck in finding those romans http://i.imgur.com/mo2zv.jpg, 
  he said ni66ers , not niggers , and how is that `` openly racist '' ?

   american supporting gun rights in europe lol, 
  [ i am a pole and so can you !, 
  yeah , most of the rivalry is in football instead . 
   in portugal , philosophy is mandatory between the 10th and the 12th years of school 10th and 11th , not in the 12th . 
   religious classes are called ` religi\u00e3o e moral ' emrc - educa\u00e7\u00e3o moral religiosa cat\u00f3lica  the grades are n't counted for the student 's average dude , emrc is only from the 5th till the 9th grade , they could n't even be accounted for when getting into college because it is n't secondary level . 
   needless to say these classes are worthless . 
  true that . 
  i never had any of them and even those that did say it was bs . 
  the euro should not be sacrificed for greece either . 
  i 'll sacrifice a goat instead . 
   we were thinking to invade portugal you have a [ bad record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish-portuguese_war ) at that . 
  yeah , fuck austerity , we were so much better when there was reckless spending . 
   plus , in the andante network , the fine for not paying your ticket is the price times 100 ... to be fair , there 's hardly any officers nowadays . 
  it 's been months since i 've seen the `` picas '' fining anyone . 
  if it 's not on football day , you 're almost guaranteed to have no hassle . 
  in june i 've even seen an old lady making a run for it and the officers laughing out loud , not even bothering to alert others that a lady was travelling with no ticket , was caught while doing so and then ran off . 
  makes me wonder why i 'll have to pay 36 $ / monthly for the pass when the gypsies get to pay nothing just because they smell , have lots of cousins and do n't give two fucks about the law . 
   minimum wage is 485 $ . 
  565 $ if you take into account the 2 extra months were paid . 
  that 's a bit silly imo , if you speak english at home and everything , trying to force another language just because that 's what you spoke centuries ago seems ridiculous , that 's forcing national identity . 
  i do n't know , it 's as if brazil suddenly decided to make their only official language the one of the natives that lived there before we arrived just to make a point or if our government tried to suddenly make us all speak archaic latin because it is part of our heritage . 
  fuck you . 
  for taking down r/rape . 
  who could argue with them ? 
   this is the skewed view of science that the nazis had . 
   it 's also scientifically wrong . 
  science is n't skewed and killing people born with defects is n't scientifically wrong . 
  science just explains how things how . 
  what you do with that knowledge is what be might or wrong , but by then you 're talking morals , not science . 
  do n't mix these two . 
  most , i guess ? 
  i do n't want to make wild predictions , that 's for sure , and saying that in a few centuries all european languages with the exception of english and spanish will die off could hardly be an even more wild prediction . 
  my father was in angola in 1968 , my mother was born that year there as well . 
  they came back to mainland portugal in 1974 .
