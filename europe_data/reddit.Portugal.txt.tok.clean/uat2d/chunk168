  you 're still free to do those things , just do n't bitch about it if you 're not allowed to screw with others ' lives because of your habits . 
   if a person is in a zone which allows smoking then that person can exercise the right to smoke and it 's up to the person who does n't want to get 2nd hand smoke to leave . 
  fuck that shit , it 's only fair that those who are harming themselves do it on their own , it wo n't be the non-smokers who are n't posing any threat to anyone the ones who 'll be asked to leave . 
  you want to smoke , fine , go to the window or stand outside , do n't force those who are n't to step outside . 
  i mean , are you serious ? 
  would you kick kids out of a coffee shop so that some guy can smoke in there ? 
  what about the rights of the kids ? 
   fuck the nhs !, 
  it 's not the role of the government to provide healthcare to the population . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  yes , it should provide some healthcare , at least the bare minimum , yes . 
  the government should n't try to make everyone have the same wealth but it also must strive for equality of opportunities , if one ca n't afford to pay for his healthcare , he should n't be sentenced to death , his expenses should be covered for everyone , then that person should pay back to society by himself paying for the taxes to fund the nhs and so on and so forth . 
  it 's not socialism , it 's only fair , i for one would n't want to live in a society where money is more valued than human life and one person can be denied healthcare because its current balance is n't enough to afford for it , you might disagree but again , opinions . 
  if it 's harmful to the health of others , it still should n't be allowed , sorry , it 's healthcare we 're talking here , not a minor nuisance . 
  just like you ca n't break a guy 's nose regardless of where you are , you should n't throw smoke at his face . 
  it might sound like an odd comparison but in both cases you 're harming others and in both cases if you need healthcare , it 's society that will have to pay for it in the nhs . 
  so just like it 's unlawful to get in a fight , it should be unlawful to smoke onto others , no exceptions . 
  do n't be so sensitive , are you going to get mad because i said swedes ca n't be courageous ? 
  did you find that insulting ? 
  allow me to disagree with you but smoking is harmful to the health of others . 
  that it might give you lung cancer and make your life much more miserable , sure , you 're free to do that with your own body , but if you 're harming others , then it 's not within your right to do that and therefore it should be banned everywhere to smoke next to people who do n't want any of that shit . 
   courageous swedish does not compute . 
  here in europe ? 
  i doubt it . 
  you 're the one talking about pedos , i was talking about two cops who might have dressed in pyjamas and said bad things about blacks . 
  it 's absolutely ridiculous , sorry , i do find these witch hunts ridiculous . 
  '' [ once upon a time , two police officers had ties with the kkk !, 
   two german police officers  two what surprises me here is how can this be news . 
  what 's next , `` an investigation revealed that there 's was an intern in the bundestag that once saved a picture to his computer and that picture displayed a swastika '' ? 
   two german police officers were formerly members of the racist ku klux klan . 
  in other news , some decades ago , a lot of german police officers were formerly members of the nazi party . 
   thankfully , we are n't in the eu , and hopefully never will be . 
  great , you wo n't be missed . 
  geez , 40 % ? 
  no thanks , i still want to save myself just a little till i eventually grow older and boring . 
  :p when i get to be 50 or 60 years old i might drink those , just like old people here in the fields drink baga\u00e7o ( [ aguardente ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aguardente ) ) , that tends to be 70 % . . my grandparents drink a bit of it very early in the morning and then work the fields with no problems all the way till lunch !, 
  i try to be moderate , if everyone 's cheering for me , i 'll get wasted , sure , but it 's not something i 'll do on my own :p i 've only started drinking more regularly this year , now with college and all , though yeah , i 've also drank a bit from time to time ever since i was a kid , i just never actually got drunk till my 18th , that 's all x ) shots , well , i know people do n't drink because of the taste of it but i still find them too strong ( and too expensive ! ), 
  so i just stick to sweet not-that-strong drinks ... besides , i do n't like to overshot the cheery and talky part , and if i remember mostly everything the day after , then that 's when i know how awesome of a party it was - i do n't need shots for that , i still have a great time and save my liver some grief doing this xp, 
  shots are too strong , i 'm only 18 , i do n't want to fuck up my liver this early . 
  sangria is fine as it is , i just need an occasion and company to drink it and have a great time :d, 
  both those countries only joined the eu after being stable democracies for some years . 
  you know , because by then not letting them in you would n't be punishing any regime , you 'd just be punishing the population . 
  how come you guys have uncensored internet , though ? 
  a dictatorship with free internet is like a fitness club with ice-cream vans . 
  you 're not , when you say it 's existence should be stopped , i just say its efficiency should be improved . 
  if you hated europe or the eu , you 'd probably not be here . 
  it 's only 3am - the party does n't stop till someone 's pregnant !,

  how to make an invasion plan : 1 . 
  get a map 2 . 
  draw arrows coming out of your country and onto the countries you want to invade 3 . 
  the more arrows , the better 4 . 
  i 'm sorry , i did n't understand . 
  they should work how and they think what ? 
   you 'd imagine if they were really into capitalism they would love the eu . 
  or maybe not , the eu was all about the free market but they do sometimes show some socialist tendencies . 
  if you do n't hate europe , you ca n't hate on the eu . 
  you might want it to change , but you ca n't hate it .

  by that logic , the usa and brazil should also be able to join the eu , they 're also indo-european , and much more related to us than the iranians .

  should we cut diplomatic relations with the usa ? 
  no , they 're barbaric persians . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbarians  the term originates from the ancient greek word \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 barbaros . 
   in ancient times , greeks used it for the people of the persian empire,

  nah , i just like to play along , i usually upvote them . 
  if so , they would n't perform that poorly in the elections .

  they are n't any closer of getting into office and mining the shores of the aegean .

  no , it 's trolling , it works like this : http://i.imgur.com/urfus.png, 
  if i was greek and needed help , i would n't turn the help down , but i still would n't vote for them . 
  x ) you ca n't buy votes like that , it 's not how things work . 
  if they want to help while being judgemental idiots and preach their nonsense , let them , at least they 're helping something . 
  it 's the same thing with priests that only give food to the poor if people say `` praise jesus '' first - as long as they 're actually helping , their bs goes ignored . 
  they 're not exactly helping their cause , they 're just helping , it 's just that those who need help are n't stupid enough to turn down the help to make a point . 
  because he 's trolling you . 
  if there 's one thing we learn from history is that people do n't learn from history .
