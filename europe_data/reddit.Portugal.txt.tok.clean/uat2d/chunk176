  it does n't mean cutting back on economic growth . 
  in fact , economic growth is severely hampered by excessive public spending . 
  dude , txampion was clearly messing around xd i was just teasing as well :p, 
  jidf detected . 
  my point was that , if anything , hollande is only going to make it worse . 
  he 's all for spending and not for controlling the budget . 
  i guess it 's still a bit early , but we 'll see , only time will tell how this unfolds . 
  they were playing wow on the train xdd, 
  is hollande seriously trying to reduce the deficit ? 
  sure , we could talk about sarkozy 's mistakes , which were plenty , but he 's not in power anymore , it 's rather pointless . 
  not germany 's fault that hollande is in power . 
   in a room without air conditioning same thing here , tomorrow i 'll have another one , fml !, 
  you used to be cool . 
  why did you let [ these guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kmf8q.jpg ) vote hollande ? 
  shit , i tried to score like stalin , answering the most authoritarian and left-wing possibly and , fuck , it seems i fail at being authoritarian . 
  when croatia gets in . 
  yeah , i also felt sad about how such inaccurate content being taken seriously . . 
  you 're complaining about 40c in your bedroom ? 
  try 40c during a 3h exam in a room filled with people at 2pm in university ... yeah , fuck everything this !, 
  about the gm food , i did n't know about that , and i might be wrong , but ca n't member-states just outright ban it in their country ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they can , and even if they ca n't , i guess they can always tax them a lot . 
  regarding the president of the eu , people like barroso are put in place by the democratically elected european parliament . 
  sure , it could be a much more direct but it 's not like he holds considerable power , and it 's also not like some of us are still officially monarchies , whose figure head is unelected . 
  still , it 's a fair point , sure , we could be better in that regard , but that 's still a long way from the eu being undemocratic , it is not , we 're all democracies and the eu itself is only sustainable if it 's backed by the people . 
   our deficits would be a lot smaller if we were paying their interest rates . 
  everyone pays interest rates . 
  they do it as well , why would we not ? 
  besides , it 's the interest rates we agreed upon and its for our debt . 
  they may be bad for us but you ca n't reach an agreement , sign the contract and then go `` hey !, 
  i do n't want these interest rates ! '', 
   long term my ass . 
  they 're thinking a few months ahead when they will have federal elections again . 
  and for that they have to have a plan for europe . 
  it 's better than what we did that seemed to consist on ruling for 4 years , contracting massive debt and let the ones that follow deal with it . 
  this is unsustainable and was never done there to the degree it was done here . 
  i 'm sorry , it 's just that i ca n't stand when people start pointing fingers at germany for their handling of these problems when they are n't the ones that created them . 
  they make mistakes , sure , but so far , they 've done the whole union much more good than harm . 
  they might make a good scapegoat but it 's not fair . 
   as long as germans view the current crisis as a `` southern '' problem rather than a shared european one -- as a one-sided coin -- and persist in the belief that pursuing austerity and reform during an economic slowdown is the answer to the problem , germans will continue to look for solutions in all the wrong places . 
  yeah , fuck germany for their economic growth and fiscal responsibility . 
  it 's not the fault of the profligate governments and their reckless spending . 
  why the austerity , ca n't they understand that the best way to leave from a crisis over-expending is to spend even more ? 
  argh , gibe money pls !, 
  ok , now seriously , that article was such biased bullshit , `` german elites '' , `` inferior southerners '' and `` hurr , germany did n't pay war reparations '' . 
  reality check , everyone , germany is the one doing most of the work and keeping us together . 
  when they say we 're acting recklessly and it 's not affordable for us to continue with the massive spending , maybe they 're right , no ? 
  just look at our deficits and at theirs , maybe then you 'll realize we need them more than they need us and that , no , they 're not out to get us . 
  seriously , fuck this biased bullshit . 
  germany is far from being perfect but at least they 're thinking on the long term and in the big scheme of things , which unfortunately many of our leaders choose not to do . 
   no , because i do n't want a remote entity have ( more ) control over my life . 
  so tell me , do you support your own country or are you a full blown anarchist ? 
   `` it is too big to be democratical '' [ citation needed ] also , [ ** the union is founded on the values of ** respect for human dignity , freedom , ** democracy ** , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities .

  it seems we wo n't need to change our constitution !, 
   you give me a fucking stomach ulcer . 
  quick , call whine-one-one !, 
  yes . 
  though you should have worded your question much better . 
   now , you can be all angry at me and call me a racist or a cultural chauvinist , but from what i 've learned through first-hand experience , from discussions with friends and from media depictions ( and , no , i 'm not talking about bild coverage ) , i do n't feel comfortable extending the same trust to , say as an example , southern italy or most of greece . 
  do n't worry , a lot of people here also trust more eu institutions than national ones . 
  ahahahaha , it 's funny because greece has corruption, 
  because `` ich kein kein deutsch '' lol, 
  where 's augustus caesar when you need him ? 
  so funneh kawaii !!!!, 
   in us , there are many automatic transfer mechanisms in place . 
  that in no way means we 're selfish bastards or that in the us they all love each other so much that they loan money to each other out of just kindness . 
   we do n't have fiscal transfer mechanisms that us has between states those can be implemented , it just takes time and planning . 
   we do n't have solidarity to ever create them it 's not about solidarity , if there 's one thing the us does n't have , its solidarity , and the dollar still holds . 
   we have only free movement of money and it alone does not good currency region make . 
  we do n't have only that , though you 're right , for the euro to be more credible , more measures need to be implemented . 
  easier said than done , in a democracy these things take time and that 's what mr. krugman does n't seem to understand . 
  steiner 's assault will bring it under control . 
  ok , i 'll be leaving now ... xd, 
  i 'm pretty sure haaveilla was n't refuting the argument , he was just stating that they 're just as bad as us . 
  it does n't invalidate krugman 's argument , it just demonstrates how hypocritical he is , he could be saying all those things about the us as well , though he does n't and decides to focus only on the eu 's ones . 
   this is why people in america wrong subreddit . 
  i did nazi that coming anne frankly i 'm offended amirite ? 
   we can learn to share power equally so that too much of it never falls into the wrong hands marx and lenin would find you amusing .

  all hail countvontroll , the new [ european emperor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_emperor#powers ) !, 
  give me eu or send me back to africa !, 
  europe europe europe !!, 
  i do n't know . 
  a dysfunctional union does n't seem to be working , and if the price to pay for further integration means that countries like the uk are likely to leave , it seems this will be a risk that the rest of the eu will have to take . 
  either way , the current situation is proving unsustainable . 
  the european union is here to stay . 
  long live the eu !, 
  freedom bless europe !, 
  i like you . 
  countvontroll for president ? 
  #europe on snoonet is that way = ,

  thank fuck there 's turkey to keep russia in check , turkey # 1 , please invade the rest of cyprus to keep russian money out . 
  are you really this delusional ? 
  how can an acronym like that be harmful for the economy ? 
  it 's a free market , people buy based on what benefits them the most , not based on `` oh , a german apple , nice '' and `` ew , portuguese apples , they 're piigs back there '' .
