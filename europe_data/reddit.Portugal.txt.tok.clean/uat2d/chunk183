  you mean like drafting ? 
  in europe ? 
  to support wars abroad ? 
  do you really think that will be more of an issue if we further integration ? 
   history has shown us that some european countries will choose war over diplomacy . 
  not in the last 60 years since we started to integrate . 
  we are writing history . 
   economics shows us that some european countries rely on war ( or defense if you want to call it that ) to maintain employment , technological prowess , engineering skills , and tax receipts . 
  not as of now . 
  and i hear about no jingoism whatsoever inside the eu , it 's in fact pretty much the opposite , every time france of the uk decide to interfere somewhere , there 's public demonstrations against it . 
  so no , i do n't think that this will ever be an issue . 
   for example france would not like to be in a war with their past colonies , but britain would n't care because they have no cultural connection to those countries . 
  what ? 
  why would france or the uk ever want to start wars in their previous colonies ? 
  and why would the people advocating military intervention ever be able to achieve so , specially against such strong and severe opposition ? 
  the way you 're talking , it seems a stronger eu is just a plot for us to dominate the world by arms again !, 
   when turkey joins up fully they would not like to be in a middle eastern war , but germany would not have the same considerations . 
  turkey will never join the eu nor will germany want to spend millions in fighting worthless unpopular wars in the middle east , for no reason whatsoever . 
   'm saying that in the case of a war one voice will speak for all nations . 
  that voice may be technically representative of all those nations , but not realistically representative due to how the voting is weighted and due to historical and cultural positions . 
  i 'm pretty sure if this ever happens , we 'll just say we support peace and perhaps try to profit a bit from it without ever becoming directly involved . 
  but that already happens as of now and a stronger eu would in no way make this a more serious matter , nobody is planning to invade anyone else !, 
  someone used a swear word on the internet , is that such a big deal ? 
  well , i ca n't even understand their alphabet , but even so , is it that offensive ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he meant that european cultures in fact have a whole lot in common . 
  i agree with him , i 'm sure if you ever visit for example poland , france or ireland you 'll find more similarities than differences , and this will be even more noticeable if you ever leave europe and see how different things are done out there when compared to how they 're done here . 
   i have no wish to see germany at the helm of yet another massive military industrial complex . 
  building , selling , and ultimately using war machines the world over . 
  this is a discussion about furthering european integration , not about building an army and conquering the world . 
  btw , by that logic , the ecsc and eec would have never been founded and we could possible be in the same situation we were some years post the treaty of versailles . 
   i have no wish to see that military directed by a shared common foreign policy , where some members border russia , and eventually iraq , iran , and syria . 
  wait , you think turkey 's ever going to get in ? 
  xd  all nations will labour to further a euro led neo-liberal agenda that worships capitalism and cares not a jot for community politics or the working man . 
  oh , i get it , you 're just a deluded lefty who thinks everyone else is out to get you . 
  well , no . 
  if you do n't trust me , at least acknowledge that we have mutual interests in peace and prosperity , and we 'd achieve them easier if we worked as a team . 
   we 're a lonely bunch on this subreddit , are n't we ? 
  british ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  you clearly are not . 
  nato ? 
  like it helped you in the falklands war ? 
  like it helped you when deng xiaoping threatened to invade hong kong if thatcher did n't transfer it to prc ? 
  like it helped you when gaddafi bombed flight 103 of pan am over scotland ? 
   do n't want to be associated with what is happening in the middle east or africa , it 's nothing to do with me . 
  i do n't want to be `` a force for good in the world '' or any other platitudinous nonsense . 
  hold on a second , we 're talking about a federal europe , not nato or the usa . 
  a more unified europe would n't suddenly makes us more warmongers . 
   local democracy is the only way to go . 
  look at switzerland and compare , it is not rocket science . 
  how about an european confederation similar to that of the [ swiss confederation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_confederation ) ? 
  that or we could continue to elect fools into office and having them choosing their own ~ ~ buddies ~ ~ experts , as they currently always do . 
  no , i 'm not being sarcastic . 
  i would n't exactly say a federal europe but we do need further integration , specially when it comes to foreign policy , regarding the free european market and making everyone abide by the same rules and standards , but of course that i do n't support the complete lost of sovereignty by everyone and the transfer of it to brussels , that would be ludicrous , extremely inefficient and anti-democratic . 
  so yeah , i guess i 'm a supporter of europe . 
  i think it would be best if we were more like a union or federation but with limited centralization and a high degree of regionalism . 
  it surely would help us in keeping united while solving our problems , which should be our current goal . 
  that description of the eu is also valid from pretty much every member-state on its own . 
  the eu is just as communist as its members , the members of your national parliament are just as unelected as the members of the european parliament and they also scam you with failed projects and laws . 
  do you also hope for your own country to fall apart soon ? 
  norway sitting on the beach catching sun ? 
  [ i doubt it . 
  wait , you posted a scarlett johansson gif and are now asking me for her boobs ? 
  no problem , for some strange reason i always seem notice those things !,

  edit : you have a strange language , how do you distinguish between '' \u0437 '' and `` 3 '' ? 
  a video about the same guy comparing italian and french to german , hilarious !, 
  xd http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv6k0lowple&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=249s, 
  this is the promo for a portuguese show but it 's very good in demonstrating how we view some of other european countries and languages : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fef_ywjs5e, 
  care to demonstrate to those of us who do n't know any of those ? 
  what about the german reaction ? 
  spaniards do n't often try to speak portuguese , but no , they do n't sound like crap at all , they sound spanish !, 
  xd if you want to , you can attempt to write something and i 'll correct you if you make some mistakes , it 's not speech but it works as well . 
  [ nova era ] ( http://www.radionovaera.pt/player.php?task=play&amp;type=silver ) - porto 's radio , great house and dance music .

  can anyone translate ? 
  if we 're discussing romance languages , perhaps the best way to know if they can be called `` latin languages '' as well is not to look into a germanic language but to a romance/latin language itself . 
   ( omg , i just learned that in spanish you can use accents on syllabes that are n't the last three ! ), 
   http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/portunhol   http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/portu%c3%b1ol   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/differences_between_spanish_and_portuguese it 's great to be able to understand these three different languages without any difficulty . 
  i never said it was wrong to call it a romance language because it is n't , you were the one saying it was wrong to call them [ latin languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_languages ) . 
  afaik , `` romance '' in portuguese means the [ narration of the heroic literature ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_%28heroic_literature%29 ) , [ love ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_%28love%29 ) or the [ romance languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_languages ) , though , to avoid confusions , we often use rom\u00e2nico / romano ( romanic/roman ) to talk about things related to ancient rome or l\u00ednguas latinas ( latin languages ) to talk about the romance languages . 
  technically , just like in english , we could just say everything is `` romance '' but a richer vocabulary is n't something we frown upon . 
  portuguese here , other than galician which is basically a somewhat archaic portuguese , i 'll say spanish without a doubt . 
  i can understand them perfectly when they speak and i very easily manage myself with spanish texts , though i never had a single spanish lesson in my life . 
  afterwards italian is probably the closest one , i mean , it starts to get different than spanish , which is much more influential , at least here , but again , i can still understand them while having never had a single italian lesson . 
  though they have to speak slowly and not wave their hands around . 
  :p french starts to get difficult and i 'm starting to forget what i learned during the 3 years i had french lessons ( part of the national curriculum ) but i can still understand them . 
  i have trouble finding some words so speaking may get difficult but i could understand sarkozy vs hollande debates so it ca n't be that bad . 
  english is not latin but damn is it easy . 
  some might disagree but i really did n't have difficulties learning it . 
  and i started late , only when i was 10 whereas most of my colleagues started when they were 6 . 
  english is everywhere and the verbs are much more easier than in latin languages , there 's a couple of irregulars and some weird pasts but other than that , `` easy as pie '' ( though i wonder how pie can be easy xd ) . 
  german , swedish , russian , greek ... 
  i might know a couple of words but other than that , nope , sorry , i just do n't find them mutually intelligible at all . 
  is that even a language ? 
  the only esperanto i know about is a car from gta .
