  but do n't worry too much , it 's not that likely to happen , it just makes good news and people get worried about listening to it all the time , because if you look at the data , we 're growing slowly just like you ( 1.6 % vs 1.7 % in 2011 ) . 
  gosh , you have awesome djs like tiesto and afrojack and you listen to that ?

  wait , you do n't love house music ?? 
  the wedding is off !, 
  yeah , that was the only part with a bit of seriousness . 
  we love you , netherlands !, 
  we love you !, 
  good , to be honest , you really need it . 
  either support the eu through the good and bad times ahead of us or be done with it , because as of now , it 's not fair that one country just keeps stalling things for everybody else and criticizing the very same union it decided to be a part of . 
   '' zeuren ' is dutch for winning . 
  :d yay , south wins !, 
  :d portuguese could also work , it 's pretty cool for poetry . 
  how about :  o norte \u00e9 morte ,  mas o sul continua azul . 
  which translates as `` north is death / but the south is still blue '' . 
  `` this is only a joke / do n't take my wallet '' . 
  yet it is said that napoleon bonaparte or adolf hitler were small men ... inferiority complex in a nutshell ? 
  worry not , i 'm pretty sure you 'll have your eu referendum if any major change is announced . 
  you 're right , i though it was made post-ww2 but i checked and it was not . 
  in fact , it also says eastern prussia , so my bad . 
  though my point remains , without any research , i know more about geography than our dictatorial regime . 
  i mean , at least i did n't make the mistake of calling the uk `` england '' or saying the republic of ireland owns all of the island . 
   `` step by step we must from now on give up more competences to europe , and allow europe more powers of control . '', 
   however , she has resisted calls for the joint issuing of eurozone debt . 
  i do n't understand . 
  damn , i was n't aware of that . 
  i 'm sure it was just some crazies , that it 's not common at all and even the catholics were quick to denounce the action . 
  i dunno , here in portugal it was legalized by referendum and that was the end of it . 
  no southerner is white . 
  now go work the fields . 
   the differences between the mostly wealthier northern european members , and the disparagingly termed `` pigs '' ( portugal , italy , greece and spain ) ? 
  it 's ok , reddit 's no longer the secret club where only the cool kids hang around . 
   'm more concerned with catholic radicals trying to censor plays they do n't like , threatening abortion clinics , etc. 
  does this even happen here ? 
  because i never heard about these issues here in europe whereas there have been plenty of news of islamists trying to impose their values on everybody else and teaching their kids to be just as bigoted as them and not letting them go through public education like everybody else . 
  i once fixed this image when it was shown on a portuguese forum . 
  i 'll now post it here and translate . 
  = crumbs ? 
  rfa/rda = frg/gdr ( at the time germany was still divided ) eram v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses = they were several countries ( and not just africa ) isto \u00e9 mar !, 
  = this is sea !, 
  ( black sea ) era urss = it was ussr isto \u00e9 deserto ? 
  = is this desert ? 
  = this is what ? 
  portugal n\u00e3o \u00e9 um pa\u00eds pequeno = portugal is n't a small country e o regime salazarista n\u00e3o era adepto de geografia = and the salazarist regime was n't a supporter of geography, 
  that asshole must be pretty fucked in the head . 
  las iceland son norwegian , anyone ? 
  well , my brain and my penis often hate each other . 
  i guess those are my jewish and muslim parts . 
  ( and after this joke , i guess i 'll be leaving now ), 
  only one sex ? 
  you 're adorable . 
  finland , give me the best you 've got and keep 'em coming !, 
   edit : and fuck you , too , person who downvoted this posting within 30 seconds or so of me saving it . 
  if i 'm wrong , kindly point that out . 
  welcome to reddit . 
  suddenly , i 'm in love . 
  now in all seriousness , how can they expect to be taken seriously when they pull shit like this ? 
  being from one country does n't necessarily mean one supports all its decisions and policies . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is the case . 
  do n't sweat it , it was surely a freudian slip . 
  even if you meant it , there 's much worse out there , it 's not like you did n't know that africa was a continent . 
  new zealand is in australia ? 
   i 'd call it pretty damn useless to do that statistic for continents . 
  the only possible competition would be australia ( ... ) i 'm pretty sure he meant oceania . 
  ok , but it better not end like this : http://www.explosm.net/comics/2797/, 
  oh , look , it 's a backward ` r ' . 
  specially after usage . 
  ok , i 'll show myself out . 
   this is a massive issue for the piigs , and is exacerbated , if not caused , by the currency being too strong . 
  false . 
  a strong currency is great for countries which import more than they export , this way the essential goods we import are n't too expensive , we can more easily invest and take loans in the outside and foreign countries have to pay us more to invest here ( and they still do such , so our surplus is greater ) . 
  as i mentioned before , most of out imports are not produced internally just because they ca n't . 
  euro , escudo or any other currency , we ca n't produce oil . 
  also , it 's not viable and sustainable even to be self-sufficient in every aspect , this is basic , adam smith and david ricardo level . 
  sure , there 's more to it , like for example , portugal 's traditional dish , [ codfish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacalhau ) is n't even found on portuguese waters , but regardless , a strong currency is very helpful in this situation . 
  i mean , our [ exports are increasing ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/exports ) . 
  btw , on a unrelated note , piigs is an unfortunate acronym . 
  would you mind not using it so often ? 
  i beg to differ , but no , we do n't need a weaker currency . 
  it would in fact be harmful for both us and the rest of the eurozone . 
  we import more than we export , so it would be prejudicial , specially when most of the products we import , we ca n't produce on our own ( namely oil , but not only ) . 
  the rest of the eurozone also would n't benefit they currency would also lose value and , with a different currency , there would be an extra impediment to the free market and suddenly there would be more complications when there 's transactions between the peripheral countries and the central ones . 
  so , no , we do n't need to leave the euro . 
  and that 's not an issue for non-euroarea members to decide . 
  and the hardships i mentioned are the debt thresholds and such , these are the same everywhere , regardless of the currency . 
   without any measures to reestablish growth , austerity will only cripple a country . 
  not necessarily , as there 's a lot of greek government spending which does n't boost the economy or helps society in a significant way , as the gains are n't superior to the deadweight loss . 
  the austerity measures taking place in greece are fundamental , for too long the country has been amassing debts without any possibility of paying them back , now that 's really taking a toll the only long term solution is cutting back on the spending , not outspend your way out of a spending crisis . 
  sure , if it 's money being used for worthwhile investments or causes , it would be foolish to not use it , otherwise , if it 's more money poorly spent , what greece needs to do is not waste it , and that 's what 's behind the austerity measures , only spend the money you really need to . 
   with every passing year of stringent austerity , the greek economy contracts and the greek government has to make more cuts due to the decreased state revenues ( due to the contracting economy ) . 
  up until 2007 greece had positive real gdp growth and its debt to gdp ratio was also increasing and over the 100 % , so even when the greek economy was growing , their debts were increasing more than their growing revenues . 
  now that their economy is contracting ( no wonder , with the amount of bad investments they had - sure , their government was spending a lot but that public expenditure was never expected to have significant returns and now their gdp shrinks accordingly ) and considering the debt they already hold , that 's their only viable solution , to struggle through the austerity measures and not to accumulate further debts which will not help them at all in the long run . 
  the thing is , even with the drachma 's hyperinflation , greece would n't improve its situation , they just delay it ( and get a much more urgent problem to deal with ) . 
  greece is where it is now because of public overspending , even if their debts were forgiven , without austerity and cutting back on this public spending , they 'd just start accumulating debts again , it 's a very simples structural problem because they 're living above their capacities , till that problem of spending more of what you can afford is fixed , greece does n't have a chance of growing . 
  yeah yeah , keep it to yourself .
