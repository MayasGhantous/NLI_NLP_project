   the eu is the one that will start mattering more and more . 
  that 's not entirely certain for now . 
  yeah , i figured as much , they 're not stupid , they 're not like some middle eastern countries which will go back to being just little more than desert once their oil runs out . 
  i have an honest question : why do catalans want so badly independence from spain ? 
  do n't they get plenty of benefits from madrid and would n't they be less relevant in the globalized world if they were detached from spain ? 
  wrong subreddit ? 
  just be sure to invest in something else in the meanwhile so you wo n't be left dry when the oil runs out . 
  yes , that 's a generalization , though i 'm portuguese myself so my country is included in that list , and from my experience , it 's not that we work less , it 's that there are less rewards for those who work harder . 
  so no , it 's not because we 're lazier , it 's because there is n't such an incentive for efficiency , and it hurts our overall competitiveness . 
  yes , i 'm familiar with the problems gypsies can bring , unfortunately . 
  i ca n't think of myself spitting in them though i must say i 'd really enjoy if we had a proper police force alongside a legal system so they could be brought to justice . 
  what 's wrong with your `` l '' ( `` l '' ) ? 
  i 've seen gypsies robbing and beating old people and women with young children or pregnant and bystanders afraid of calling the police not to have them screwing up their lives as well . 
  i 'm not making this up , these things do n't just happen by change , the hate often goes both ways . 
  he 's not saying spanish are lazy , he 's telling events that happened to him . 
  if you do n't like it , too bad , but that does n't make the fact that the spanish economy is less competitive than , for example , the norwegian or the german one . 
  if both economies were equally competitive , they would be in similar situations , which they clearly are not . 
  i had one for breakfast , it was to die for !, 
  the 5th post on the frontpage is from a year ago . 
  too bad , it certainly has potential . 
   portuguese : unidade na diversidade not really , that 's `` unity in diversity '' . 
  `` united in diversity '' should be `` unida na diversidade '' . 
  i do n't know a word of romanian but since they 're similar to latin , i 'd assume their `` unitate \u00een diversitate '' is also `` unity in diversity '' rather than `` united in diversity '' . 
  dude , chechnya is technically part of europe , and that tank may not bring too many good memories there . 
  suddenly i 'm in love .

  this is a [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nertfo-sk ) where that bull is present , it 's unrelated to this topic but it 's still a great video . 
  as much as federalization seems like a much better alternative than dismemberment , it does n't seem likely that a full federalization will be possible , i ca n't picture the most euroskeptical countries to just accepting the transfer of sovereignty to brussels . 
  still , i guess we rather have a federation with less than the 27 of us than no union at all . 
   i despise the socio-economic mismanagement of the eu , in essence because it has lead to social unrest the way you 're talking , it seems it has always been like this . 
  the eu has been around for much longer than these recent problems . 
  but i get what you 're trying to say , things could be better , sure , i just do n't `` despise '' them because of it , i just want things to be fixed so the stability and prosperity can return . 
   as for the rest , i despise the eu how can you be grateful then ? 
   the bail-out money instead of being given to the government and banks , should be given to people and companies able to generate some real wealth , ** that would generate taxes revenue for the government ** . 
  sure , but first you need to keep public spending in check . 
  if the greek government continues to spend as it did in the past , all the bail-out money in the world would n't be able to increase aggregate demand enough to counter-balance their government debt . 
   that 's why we created the eu . 
  to help each other out , to share the burden . 
  now it 's time to do that . 
  it 's difficult to do that when we 're still more divided than we are united . 
  which is a good thing , we clearly need hayek as keynes is clearly not working .

  does it even matter ? 
  [ israel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) , [ armenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenia_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) , [ georgia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) or [ morocco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) would argue that you do n't need to be in europe to participate in the esc . 
  i say next year we invite south africa , north korea , indonesia and brazil !, 
  that would make it even more interesting !, 
   i do n't think they ever will . 
  they follow their narrative with an almost religious ferver . 
  if you do n't even try , then you obviously wo n't achieve much in changing their minds . 
  i 've myself talked some people out of voting communist or socialist by simply showing them that there 's no easy way out of this crisis and that these parties ' rhetoric simply does n't work as they say in the real world . 
  you have to take it easy and have them reconsider their beliefs and how they can work in the real world , if you just shove what you think down their throats and call them stupid then they 'll most likely just ignore you , even though you 're right . 
  yeah , well , they might be annoying but i do n't feel i can hate them back , they believe what they believe not because they 're evil but because they 're misinformed . 
  besides , it 's not like it would serve us much good to hate them back , it would be much better if they at least allowed us to try and change their minds ( and that 's much easier to do if you do n't just assume they 're idiots ) . 
  with reasonable dialogue , thought-out conversation and time , anyone can realize we do n't live in a black & white world , that things never go as planned and that our problems are often caused by stupidity rather than by planned evil . 
  i do n't wish that , i ca n't wish them harm . 
  i just wish they realized nobody is out to get them and they started criticizing less and working more to improve things for all of us . 
   does she seriously expect that greece who just had its economy destroyed be the imf and ecb greece destroyed its own economy for spending way more than what it could sustain for years . 
  do n't blame a long time structural problem on the banks trying to get you back on your feet . 
   to pay back its debt immediately at these insane interest rates ? 
  firstly , nobody is demanding you to pay everything right now . 
  what everyone wants is your economy not sinking anymore , while you continue to spend more than what you earn , that is simply impossible . 
  as for the interest rates , if you do n't agree with them , then you should n't have asked for the loans . 
  if you agreed to them voluntarily , what are you complaining about now ? 
  you do n't just agree to something , get the benefits and then change your mind about your obligations . 
   how does she expect greece to pay back all this debt that was pushed onto them by astronomical interest , during what is becoming a great depression in greece ? 
  the debt was n't pushed onto greece , the interest was accepted by the greeks when they could just say no . 
  interest is n't what got you so deep , it was your low productivity and your astronomical spending . 
  everyone else has to pay interest , otherwise nobody be interested in lending . 
  if you really hate interest rates , then you should have just stopped asking for loans and either cut all spending or defaulted , which i doubt would have been a better scenario for you . 
  btw , had you kept your spending in check and not tried to fool everyone with accounting fraud , you probably would be paying less interest right now . 
   its pretty sad how germany can go and murder tens of millions of people and be forgiven immediately of all there debts and thievery again with ww2 ? 
  they were nazis , they were n't a free country under hitler , did you know that ? 
  and they 're all gone now , are you seriously trying to excuse a democratic greek government series of fuck-ups on the economy by saying post-ww2 germany had to be forgiven much of the harm it caused ? 
  are you also going to start blaming belgians for the congo free state or the spanish for the conquest of the incas and saying that because they were n't as a people punished for those acts , you should also not have to pay for the debts you accumulated ? 
  or do you think punishing post-ww2 germany like post-ww1 germany was with the treaty of versailles would have been the right thing to do ? 
   greek people are already on the edge and too prideful to sit idly by as these banking cunts try to destroy the country . 
  if greeks are on the edge , they have nobody but their governments to blame , because it was them who continued to spend more than what they should and ignoring the consequences . 
  now you 're all having to deal with those consequences all at once and it 's not pretty , but it 's certainly not the fault of the rest of the eu or the fault of those who trust in you and are giving you money to pay for your debt , that 's just scapegoating and demagogy , the `` banking cunts '' are n't destroying your country , if it was n't for them you 'd now have no money at all !, 
  those who are to blame are those you spent it all away , though i still suggest you to focus more in getting your shit together and trying to recover from all this before trying to bring those to blame to justice . 
   i believe if greece leaves the chains of these euro technocrats who aim to destroy greece from within , greece can prosper with new allies . 
  euro technocrats who aim to destroy greece from within ? 
  greece can prosper with new allies like turkey , russia and china ? 
  are you really that delusional ? 
   sorry - we have n't been able to serve the page you asked for http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/25/payback-time-lagarde-greeks, 
  [ list of countries by gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) [ list of countries by hdi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) [ list of countries by suicide rates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) it 's all relative , i guess . 
  what i mean is that your whining was n't really legitimate , hungary has a gdp ( ppp ) per capita of 20k usd , a 0.82 hdi and a suicide rate of 25 per 100k people whereas countries like brazil , for example , have a gdp ( ppp ) per capita of 11k usd , 0.72 hdi and a suicide rate of 5 per 100k people , that 's 5 times less likely to commit suicide than in hungary !, 
  my point is that we sometimes forget of how good we have it and the results can be quite pathetic , i seriously would like to see an hungarian , a german or a finnish complaining to a brazilian , a mexican or a turkish of how bad they have it . 
  this picture is from the belo horizonte favela in brazil . 
  look at their reaction to those problems : http://i.imgur.com/cykxa.jpg, 
  and the aussies would n't pull the plug when the kiwis performed or harass those who voted for them . 
  we , maybe we should do just that !, 
  i think he 's german . 
   implying justin bieber or the black eyes peas would win anything in the esc . 
  a swiss against neutrality !? 
  what 's the world coming to !, 
  the way you worded that sentence , one might think nascar can be interesting . 
  it 's not , it 's just cars driving in a circle . 
  i 'd rather watch glue dry .
