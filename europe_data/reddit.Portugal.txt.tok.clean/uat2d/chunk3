  except that it never happens like that in real life . 
  [ example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predatory_pricing#criticism ) . 
   51 % of the factory or the company . 
  that 's their loss , they 're the ones who are losing out on our perfectly fine automobiles . 
  i see no logic whatsoever in trying to punish them because they 're trying to restrict imports from us , it 's their loss , we 'll only be harming us even further if we replicate their behaviour . 
   i am pro europe and pro mondialisation , but the eu trade policy is stupid . 
  i do n't think you understand what it is to be pro globalisation . 
   we open our borders to china and when we want to sell cars in china they have to own 51 % they have to own 51 % what ? 
   the solar industry should be protected as china massively subsidize it . 
  so what ? 
  you do n't want cheaper solar panels paid for by the chinese taxpayers ? 
  why should we ever refuse reverse foreign aid ? 
   why ? 
  [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=effects+of+protectionism ) [ youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=protectionism ), 
   trade protectionism absolutely disgusting . 
   do you actually think what worked in athens 500 b.c. 
  is even a little applicable now in the overgrowing complexity of the 7 billion people interconnected societies ? 
  representative democracy also is that old , so that argument goes both ways . 
   in my opinion representative democracy is fine . 
  but elected politicians should lead instead of merely follow an ever changing trend from polls/twitter/whatever ... 
  they do whatever is politically profitable for them to do . 
  do n't blame the players , blame the game . 
   ~ ~ direct ~ ~ ** representative ** democracy of that sort does n't work . 
  people will vote for anything which seems superficially plausible , have a look at ~ ~ california ~ ~ ** southern europe ** , where they voted to increase spending commitments while decreasing taxation , and thereby squeezed out vital services such as education and infrastructure maintenance , while running up a debt which put them on the verge of insolvency . 
  there , the argument against direct democracy is just as strong and just as weak as the argument against representative democracy . 
   i 'd say if you were born in israel , then you are more likely to be jewish than , say , someone born in ireland . 
  but that 's not because you were born in israel but because your upbringing was jewish . 
   http://i.imgur.com/8skc2ts.gif sorry for sounding like an edgy atheist but tbh i do n't think your beliefs are affected by the region of the globe you 're in . 
   probably has something to do with the region . 
  you misspelled religion . 
   `` you have reached your article limit  register to continue reading or subscribe for unlimited access '' here :  ** ukraine and the european union ** - ** west or east ? 
  **   ** the european union should sign a deal with ukraine -- but only if yulia tymoshenko is freed **   its very name means `` borderland '' . 
  ukraine has long been on the edge between east and west . 
  now this country of 46m people is poised to tilt westward by signing an association agreement with the european union next month that also promises freer trade . 
  but vladimir putin , russia 's president , is putting pressure on ukraine instead to join belarus and kazakhstan in a eurasian customs union that has become his pet project . 
    the russian sales pitch is simple . 
  russia remains the single biggest market for ukrainian exports . 
  ukraine would get cheaper gas ( belarus , which has also sold its gas distributor to russia 's gazprom , pays less than half as much ) . 
  russia would ease the country 's huge debt burden , much of it owed to gazprom . 
  mr putin was also the main backer of ukraine 's president , viktor yanukovych , in november 2004 , when his rigged election was overturned in the orange revolution . 
  most alluring of all , the russians , unlike the eu , would not make pesky demands for human rights , the rule of law , an end to corruption and a proper democracy . 
    yet ukraine would gain far more from going west . 
  trade is shifting to what is , in overall terms , a much bigger and richer market than the eurasian union could ever be . 
  the eu has a well-tried formula for helping to reform and liberalise economies from the former soviet block . 
  even ukrainian oligarchs close to mr yanukovych recognise that more competition from the eu will help them modernise their companies . 
  in the future , an association agreement could even be a precursor to eventual eu membership . 
    but what is pushing the ukrainians towards the eu now is not all this . 
  it is russian bullying . 
  mr putin says ukraine is a sovereign country able to make its own choice . 
  but it is doubtful that he believes this . 
  not only did russia rule most of ukraine for two centuries , but kievan rus is seen as the cradle of the modern russian state . 
  many russians still live in ukraine : crimea is 80 % russian . 
  to deter ukraine from turning west , the russians briefly imposed trade restrictions recently , even banning chocolate imports . 
  a kremlin adviser has called the signing of an association agreement `` suicide '' , warned of a ukrainian default and even threatened to split apart the country 's russian - and ukrainian-speaking halves ( see article ) . 
    ** free yulia **   when armenia was pushed around by russia , it caved and decided to join the eurasian union . 
  but the response in georgia and moldova has been to move closer to the eu . 
  similarly , in ukraine , polls show that support for the association agreement has risen to over 50 % . 
  mr yanukovych has no desire to play second fiddle in a club dominated by mr putin . 
  but russia 's stance has also injected geopolitics into the debate . 
  some europeans argue that , to head off any risk of losing ukraine to mr putin , the eu should relax its conditions for the association agreement , especially its demand that mr yanukovych 's political opponent , yulia tymoshenko , should be released from jail , where she has languished since her politically motivated trial in june 2011 . 
    that would be a mistake . 
  the eu 's pressure has been working . 
  ukraine may still be a corrupt oligarchy , but it has been making reforms demanded by brussels . 
  it is widely expected that mrs tymoshenko will soon be sent to germany for medical treatment ; she may be released thereafter . 
  more generally , the value and appeal of an association agreement lies precisely in the conditions it sets for liberalisation and reform : to soften these for one special case would weaken them for all . 
  the eu would keep leverage even after an association agreement is signed . 
  brussels hopes to implement its free-trade elements immediately , but it needs ratification by national parliaments to come fully into force ; that process will probably last until beyond the next ukrainian presidential election in early 2015 . 
    if russia sticks to its threats , ukraine will also need financial assistance from the europeans to see it through the winter . 
  it should get it . 
  the eu could also ease its visa regime and help more students go west . 
  to both sides , ukraine is the most valuable prize left in eastern europe . 
  indeed , this moment could be as critical for the region as the decision in the 1990s to admit the ex-communist countries of central europe to the eu . 
  fortunately , thanks to mr putin 's inept bullying , the prize should now fall into europe 's lap . 
   germany has revoked the privilegia of greece . 
  oh look , more references to europa universalis . 
   money . 
  with our economic policies , we could be sitting on an ocean of oil and still be as poor as venezuela . 
   a preferential voting system . 
  why not proportional representation ? 
   this is my first european autumn and it feels so fucking ominous . 
  i 'm expecting white walkers in a month or so . 
  sorry , you 'll have to wait till march to see those again . 
   minimum wage is n't the cause of unemployment rates in this country . 
  it is in mine and in countries like spain and greece . 
  of course most people are unaffected by minimum wage as they can on their own earn more than the legal minimum but for example our youth unemployment rates are no joke . 
   youth , by law , earn significantly less than adults and youth unemployment is extremely high . 
  it was n't always the case and it has been exacerbated by laws such as the minimum wage . 
   do n't you shiver at how many full-time employment positions ( that might be covered by collective agreements ) are axed and replaced by `` flexible hours '' that are not bound by any agreement so they can pay you as little as 1 euro per hour , and they might only give you one shift per week ? 
  no because workers are free to refuse those jobs if they can find better opportunities . 
   i 'd shiver to find out what jobs that do n't require an education would pay if these minimum wages where not in place . 
  do n't you shiver at the unemployment caused by minimum wages ? 
  oh , the people of germany ( or austria , or denmark , or switzerland , or sweden , or norway , or finland ) have no minimum wage and they seem to be just fine without it . 
   liberal rats are fleeing the sinking ship . 
  the fdp lost two third of their voters , mainly to the cdu , many to afd and pirates . 
  why ? 
   a remnant that still has relevance for those without cars and there are still fax machines for those who think phone connection and email is n't sufficient . 
  it 's still no reason to subsidise them through public funding , specially when there are plenty of viable alternatives . 
  you talked about cars but trains on their own are more expensive to society than cars , and there are other methods of transportation like the bus or , if it 's a considerable distance , even low-cost flights which would serve the same needs without imposing such a cost . 
   this way the market will ensure we all get a great deal on train fares !, 
  or not , given how expensive it is to build and operate trains and the whole railways and stations .
