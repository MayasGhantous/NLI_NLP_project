  it 's easy , get some more loans or just print some money , that will fix it all . 
   out of the 500 billion in debt greece has , only 50-75 billion in due to tax evasion . 
  and 90 % of that tax evasion came from hotel chains , bars , clubs , bouzoukia , wealthy elite etc who could afford to bribe and evade taxes . 
  out of all the money you spent , could n't some of it be used to keep the courts working properly ? 
   the problem in greece has always been about government spending , mainly military spending with arms race against turkey and events like 2004 olympics which will take 150 years to pay off completely . 
  you 're right , the problem was and has always been government spending . 
   any fool who does n't know what he 's saying . 
  yeah , benefits for everyone do n't lead to debt , the money for that comes from the tooth fairy . 
   had you said an oversized military it would have some truth to it . 
  that as well . 
   i think the problem was that the main economical activity , shipping , was not taxed . 
  and if you taxed shipping like you taxed the other activities , shipping would have never become the main economical activity . 
   the problems of greece are not about big government but that the big economical actors did not pay the taxes they should . 
  only the big economical actors ? 
  the widespread and rampant corruption affected everyone . 
   that 's the tax revenue , of greece , finland and portugal , which is about most of government expenses , then we see that finland has a quite bigger government than both greece and portugal . 
  yet if you compare the [ public debt ] ( http://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=z8ehg1neoorltg_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=govdebt_t1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:oecd:nmec&amp;idim=country:grc:fin:prt&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) or the [ gdp per capita ] ( http://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=z8ehg1neoorltg_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=natinccap_t1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:oecd:nmec&amp;idim=country:grc:fin:prt&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) of the same countries , another pattern emerges . 
  it 's also worthwhile to analyse an [ index of economic freedom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_economic_freedom ) where finland also scores much better than portugal or greece . 
   in a country where the government does n't assign me to an employer . 
  now i 'm curious . . are you from the usa ? 
   pasok modernised greece , enriched it , but then mismanaged it . 
  the country racked up vast debts while pasok and the centre-right new democracy alternated in power . 
  who would have ever thought that an oversized welfare state would lead to an oversized debt problem ? 
   the party is criticised for sowing the seeds of future problems by building a bloated public sector based on patronage . 
  tens of thousands of jobs were created in state companies and then given to pasok members : a system that continued under new democracy . 
  yeah , trying to promote labour through the public sector , no wonder that happened when there were such perverse incentives . 
   so what is replacing pasok 's social democracy ? 
  the answer is clear in nearby patras . 
  the city was always a party stronghold . 
  but in last year 's election , it ditched pasok for the first time , backing the new anti-bailout leftists , syriza . 
  these people must think that the answer to the problems of big government is even bigger government but with other people running it . . 
   he/she is only a by-product of the propaganda and slander that is being spoken about the greeks in germany openly . 
  that propaganda and open racism being accepted by germans plants its seeds in everyone to you , it 's always some big conspiracy . 
   until i see germans openly speak against the racism and stereotypes of greeks/southern europe then i will have very little respect for what they have to say . 
  hey , i 'm a southern european and i do n't feel discriminated against in the slightest . 
  yes , there are some idiots who happen to be german that say that the portuguese are lazy and corrupt , just like there are some idiots who happen to be portuguese that say that the germans are evil and greedy - but that does n't mean anything , there have always been and there will always be idiots , there 's no need to take them so seriously . 
  anyway , i 'm not expecting nor do i want apologies from anyone , i just want for europe to stop the finger-pointing and to actually coming together and working this through and in the end to take the steps required to prevent the problems that triggered this mess from ever arising in the future . 
  easier said than done , i know , but it 's feasible and we 'd have a better chance at it if we were more focused in dealing with our issues as opposed to complaining and constantly shifting the blame to the other side . 
   i know a bulgarian . 
  she is ludicrously nice and not a beggar at all . 
  i know a frisian . 
  he does n't fancy my kind of music . 
   i am just assuming that you are greek ; you should get a flair . 
  he is . 
   if you are german i would not be surprised . 
  you are pretty much what i imagine the majority of germans think sub-consciously if not out-right like are you doing now . 
  what the fuck , mitso ? 
  so you complain about racism and discrimination against turks and greeks and then you do just that against the germans ? 
  yes because of the sheer number of people that speak portuguese  it 's also very very similar to spanish so that should make things simpler :p, 
   the sentence `` i 've got pencils in my pocket '' in hungarian would be `` zsebemben ceruz\u00e1k vannak '' . 
  the gramatical reason why it 's like this is : `` zseb-em-ben ceruza-k van-nak '' meaning ( literally ) `` pocket-my-in pencil-multiple exist-multiple '' . 
  damn , that sounds so strange . 
  in portuguese that sentence is `` tenho l\u00e1pis no meu bolso '' , literally meaning '' ( i ) have pencils in my pocket '' :p, 
  the next week i 'll just laugh when hollande says once more that we need more restrictions and more government intervention in the economy . 
  not sure why you 'd offer that to a female friend in germany but gasoline is much cheaper there than it is here . 
   money does not magically create resources , it merely redirects them from one use and another . 
  so we ca n't just print money and become wealthy ? 
   what absolutely shocks me about wealth is how plain greedy wealthy people are . 
  `` oh , the wealthy are greedy , if i was that wealthy , i 'd share my money and keep it inside the country , so much so that i would n't be wealthy '' lol, 
   socrates for prime minister 2013 !, 
   we could be using them to solve the crises instead of the constants motions to overthrown the government that the socialist party , the communist party and the left block are constantly making . 
  it 's in the 4th in 2 years already . 
  only 4 ? 
  i was going to swear we 've had a couple more . 
   then we will be truly fucked again . 
  nah , we 've got fucked when s\u00f3crates decided to spend millions of euros . 
  this is the aftermath of it , if not one way then it would just be some other just as painful way . 
  oh look , it 's the hurr durr evil american corporations again , this time trying to export to other markets and do evil things there too . 
   * obligatory comment about paedophilia and the catholic church *, 
   at least you still have them on court rooms . 
  we put ours on the tv screen . 
   when one speaks of leaving the $ , default is implied . 
  as for the default , i do n't know any more , it would set a bad precedent and we 'd have to live some decades without financing , but if we did proceed with the reforms and liberalised everything , well , things might actually go wrong . 
  unfortunately , this might be even less likely than the people of north korea holding a free and democratic election and their regime stepping down from power . 
  still , one can dream , ca n't he ? 
  i do wish for portugal to be more like switzerland or new zealand and less like spain or greece . 
   ( or a big haircut ) is implied . 
  [ i do n't want that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhqy5y5bwq ) . 
   lol if we left the euro we certainly would n't be paying no debts . 
  or that though i do n't know we 'd manage when we ( eventually ) needed foreign financing . 
   if i 've learnt anything from / r/europe it 's that the portuguese will complain no matter what . 
  i guess we 'll just have to keep on crying wolf even louder . 
  and the greek minimum wage is 60 % their average wage . 
  and they still have massive taxes , restrictive regulations and a mess of a justice system . 
   privatization is a catalyst for social inequality and high-level/large scale fraud . 
  and so is nationalisation . 
   football is essentially globalised . 
  european footballers could quite easily hop over to south america or even the usa at a push . 
  any regulation would have to be done at the fifa level , rather than the european level . 
  and then someone could still establish some other international football association , one without caps on the wages players can receive , and the players would play in those instead rather than the ones organised by fifa . 
  but i guess this wo n't sway people away from trying to impose price controls . 
   the tax just brings back the subsidies that football receives ... if we are lucky . 
  then cut both taxes and subsidies and also save some money on the bureaucracy required to process those . 
   the free market ? 
  you know how much government money is thrown at them ? 
  club in debt , city buys stadium , subsidizes and what not . 
  if the state subsidizes them , then it should n't , that 's a failure of government and not a failure of the free enterprise system . 
   otoh this makes it easier to exit the euro as we are n't so dependent on fossil fuels . 
  yet , on the third hand , we still should n't leave the euro as printing money to both pay the debt and improve the trade balance wo n't makes us wealthier , we wo n't get a free lunch , higher inflation and much more expensive imports will severely decrease our purchasing power . 
   for disclosure i do have a mod which reduces my infamy slightly faster than standard .
