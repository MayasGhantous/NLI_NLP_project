   and everybody trying to benefit at the expense of everybody else through corporate collusion is better how ? 
  as long as profit is made through voluntary agreements and not through government benefits , there 's absolutely no problem . 
  though i was talking to savanajeff , geez , i guess i ca n't talk with people unless through private messages without idiots like you showing up out of nowhere . 
   i used to be a neoliberal , before i realised it was a similar kind of scam as trickle down economics , though with some mild utility . 
  i used to be a centrist because i wanted the best of both worlds , the efficiency and productivity of capitalism and the equity and fairness of social liberalism . 
  then i realised it 's by keeping a strong state that is allowed to provide this and that that leads to crony capitalism , that if a state is allowed to give special favours then it 's human nature to try and get those and we end up in this situation where everybody tries to benefit at the expense of everybody else through government . 
  so here i am , a neoliberal . 
   and then they complain about the size of the government . 
  i would n't be sad to see the south leave the union . 
  i say let them if they try again . 
  texas has oil and florida has umf , why do n't you give those to us ? 
   krugman is a joke , he won one nobel prize and thinks he 's an expert on the world economy , disregarding that every single time he 's commented about europe he 's been dead wrong . 
  the estonians austerity programme was a failure according to him , yet in 2011 they had an over 8 % growth rate , and over 3 % in the years following their austerity programme . 
  damn savanajeff , i see you often here and i still do n't know where exactly do you stand with regards to economic policy . 
  this to say that i agree with you :p, 
   pretending like austerity is the only possible solution when you face a heavy recession is far from an uncontested opinion yep , you 're right , sorry , i 'm just a bit tired of hear people arguing against it as if there some other alternative , as if we could get a free lunch and that some foreign entity would pay for our spending . 
   down voting anyone who does n't hold the same views on economics because you are a true believer does n't really help create an atmosphere where we can debate these issues seriously and come up with good solutions . 
  yup , sorry , i 'm just tired of the krugman spam though you 're right , my bad . 
  i do spend a lot of time here on r/europe debating these issues , if you stick around you 'll notice me :p, 
   some nobel-prize winning economists oh , look , krugman , the idiot that does n't know about the broken window fallacy . 
   [ krugman - 9/11 was good for the economy ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/14/opinion/reckonings-after-the-horror.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ), 
   even when they construct a decent argument . 
  there 's no decent argument for not controlling state expenditures . 
   the great depression is the evidence . 
  evidence of what , the harms of deflation ? 
  because that 's what happened - a contractionary monetary policy . 
   for instance there was a big boom in manchester following its reconstruction after the ira attacks . 
  bullshit , that came from the savings , it was money that could have been spent elsewhere . 
  according to you - destruction is profit . 
  why do n't you burn down your house to stimulate the economy ? 
   as a long time eu federalist , i can not support what is going on right now . 
   paul krugman : '' [ 9/11 was good for the economy ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/14/opinion/reckonings-after-the-horror.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ) '' lol , what a retard . 
   yeah it 's a really silly thing , turkish tv soap operas are so popular here in serbia with like ~ 3 million views per show , hell , everything turkey related is becoming more popular . 
  i really do n't understand those people , did n't they have had it enough ? 
  portugal has the opposite with brazil , it 's them that are flooding us with their soap operas . 
  that video is such bullshit , sorry guys, 
   sorry , you may think you 're an expert on this stuff because you 've been reading gdp statistics , but you 're not . 
   i studied asian economies for 4 years and i have lived in south korea and studied developmental economics and economic history there . 
  i bet that makes you so smart . 
  which side do you take [ in this argument ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qqg6ourham ) ? 
   it 's 2 at night and i 'm honestly not in the mood to go into a huge discussion on why you 're wrong about this me neither . 
   you 're wrong about this , but just know that you are . 
  no , you . 
   south korea and japan both had the world 's highest growth rates ( at the time ) with a policy of tariffs and protectionism . 
  despite protectionism , you mean . 
  anyway , hong kong has unilateral free trade their gdp ppp is of ~ 50k usd compared to ~ 36k usd in japan and ~ 32k in south korea . 
   it 's not as simple as you make it out to be . 
  actually , it is - protectionism only acts to protect domestic consumers against foreign lower prices . 
   your accounting is incomplete . 
  in the end of the first scenario , the french populace get :   - iron   - a book   - 5 fr   in the second one they get :   - iron   - 15 fr what do you care about the actual fr ? 
  the wealth is n't the money but the goods and services !, 
  heck , you could mint a lot of coins and print a lot of money and nobody would become richer , prices would just go up with inflation because there would be more currency in circulation for the same amount of goods and services . 
  and even in the example , on the first scenario , the french get for 15fr iron and books whereas on the second one they get for 15fr only iron . 
  you 're focusing on the actual currency but even so , what about it ? 
  be it the french iron producers or the belgians getting paid , we 're talking about fr , they were legal tender in france and not in belgium , in both cases , the french economy would benefit from the consumption that would inevitable occur once either the french or the belgian spent his fr . 
   the example you chose clearly shows how tariffs favor the domestic economy . 
  damn , compare [ india 's performance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_india#pre-liberalisation_period_.281947.e2.80.931991.29 ) ever since they liberalised free trade , [ here 's their gdp growth rate ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/india_gdp_without_labels.png ) . 
  and what about [ hong kong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_hong_kong ) that is so small , [ has no tariffs ] ( http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/passenger_clearance/duty_free/ ) and a gdp larger than austria despite not having only 1 % of the land area ? 
  no domestic economy has even been favoured by tariffs , it 's always the opposite , the lower the restrictions on foreign trade , the better that country is . 
  look at it like the economists look at it , [ here 's a graph ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:effectoftariff.svg ) that shows what actually happens . 
  all the evidence is against you - the freer the trade , the more prosperous a nation is . 
   when usa buys oil to saudi arabia with dollars , saudis do not have an obligation to spend it on us goods . 
  they buy cars in germany , clothes in china , power plants in france , and maybe some iphones in us . 
  yeah , the dollars may go in roundabout ways but what of the germans or the chinese or the french , what will they do with the dollars ? 
  wo n't they eventually use it to buy us-made products ? 
  after all , the us dollar is legal tender there and they produce goods and services !, 
  the more you export , the more the others will be able to import from you and benefit just like we benefited when we imported from them !, 
  you raising up tariffs or devaluing your currency only achieves one thing - you 're working for less and getting less in terms of goods and services than you would otherwise get . 
   natural monopolies are markets in which the cost of entry is much higher than the cost of staying in the market . 
  wrong , it 's a market where the marginal costs are constantly diminishing in the economically relevant area . 
   normally they are either government owned or owned by private companies under very heavy regulation to prevent the problems which otherwise arise . 
  actually the textbook solution is n't state ownership but rather a price that equals the mean cost . 
   for example , the road network that 's not a natural monopoly , that 's the lack of a market as you have a very difficult time charging people who use it . 
  same thing with public lighting or military protection . 
  not a monopoly as it 's not even a market . 
  anyway , you 'll probably struggle in finding a good example of a monopoly that has arisen without government intervention as even [ milton friedman who won the nobel prize had a hard time finding actual examples of those ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdlbzffgfqu ) . 
  [ foda-se ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oomzltkjo04 ) !, 
   $ 1 million   $ 1 million   1 million euros   1 million eur they 're all fine . 
  i 'd probably write that as 1.000.000 $, 
   one pointer though , the plural of euro is also euro , not euros . 
  that must be in english at least , here the plural of euro is euros just like every other plural . 
   i get \u00e9 with altgr + e. 
  i get it with * \u00b4 * and then * e * x ), 
   since i discovered that i can type $ with altgr +5 i prefer to use $ over the word euro . 
  i type [ $ with altgr + e ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_keyboard_layout ) though it was n't something hard to discover , it 's right there on the keyboard :p, 
   who enforces contracts ? 
  the courts but it 's not like you can buy the courts and the judges , i mean , it depends , in some countries you unfortunately can , but that 's not a failure of capitalism , it 's a failure of government . 
   also , what about natural monopolies - very few economists would accept that they can operate unregulated without a market failure . 
  which natural monopolies ? 
  care to give me a few practical examples of monopolies that have arisen without any governmental intervention ? 
   i do n't see how this example prove anything else than my point . 
  it demonstrates that the benefit of trade restrictions on domestic employment in one industry is done at the cost of employment in some other industry . 
   how hard is it to realize that in the first case 10 fr have left the french economy and that in the second one they stay inside ? 
  on the one hand the french populace gets for 15 fr iron and a book and on the second one the french populace only gets iron for such amount . 
  as for the 10 fr that went abroad , what about it ? 
  the belgians wo n't bury it in the garden nor throw it out at sea , they 'll use it to buy french made products , the 10 fr would come back into the french economy sooner or later and indirectly then stimulate french production in some other area other than iron . 
   besides , it 's amazing we do n't have more russian stories , them being the biggest country in the world and being pretty much mostly focused in europe and all . 
  there 's an insane amount of interesting things from russia , i for one ca n't get enough of their dashcam videos . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baacjsdu2bm ) 's one fine example . 
   if you ca n't grasp the notion that having less jobs cause a decrease of income , i ca n't convince you of anything .
