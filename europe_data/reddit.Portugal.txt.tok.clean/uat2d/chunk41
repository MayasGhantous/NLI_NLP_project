  the whole eu could impose a minimum wage and still be harmed by it just like the usa has a federal minimum wage and youth unemployment increases every time they raise it . 
   the present state is that europe has high unemployment . 
  higher minimum wage = higher unemployment . 
  lower or absence of minimum wage = lower unemployment . 
   the problem is there is a great demand for work , but little supply of jobs . 
  you 're getting things switched , it 's supply and demand of labour , unemployment is caused by too high supply and too little demand for labour . 
  [ here 's a graph from wikipedia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/wage_labour.svg/500px-wage_labour.svg.png ) that should help in getting the point across , pretend that 's in the labour market for fast-food workers . 
   that empowers the employer , not the worker . 
  yup , the bargaining power of the employee can have a very significant impact in that person 's wage . 
  the way to increase the worker 's bargaining power however is not with regulation like the minimum wage but rather to decrease the unemployment rate ( so that it 's easier for someone to find employment and harder for someone to employ for a lower wage ) and to improve that worker 's skills ( highly skilled workers or those who have worked for a long time in the field may be very difficult and costly to replace and therefore can justify higher wages ) . 
   we could either abolish minimum wage everywhere , or have a minimum wage everywhere . 
  not really . 
  you could impose a worldwide minimum wage and enforce it strictly but the principle would still apply - people ca n't employ at a loss . 
  the higher you raise the minimum wage , the more you require from workers - those that for whatever reason are n't as productive and would generate a loss for employers if they were hired at the minimum wage would become unemployable . 
   government 's are moving towards minimum wages ( see above for the cdu 's new policy of it ) . 
  and others are cutting back on it by making them have different values for different people and changing with accordance to the skills of the individual - it 's not a perfect system but it 's much more politically acceptable than saying you want to abolish the minimum wage and in effect it does lower the people affected by the minimum wage by driving the price below the market equilibrium ( in essence , making it redundant just like the minimum wage is redundant for so many people who easily earn more than that ) . 
  see [ australia ] ( http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx ) and [ new zealand ] ( http://www.dol.govt.nz/er/pay/minimumwage/ ) . 
  i 'd still prefer no minimum wage like norway , germany or singapore because it would hurt nobody and remove the restrictions on the labour market and allow plenty of unemployable people to suddenly be able to find a job and improve their lives through work with dignity and not be dependent on social benefits or charity for income . 
   the free market is great , but there are areas where it should not be prioritised . 
  the free market is amazing and as long as there 's no negative externalities such as pollution , do n't restrict it . 
   according to many government 's , minimum wage is one of those areas . 
  and according to many governments , the death penalty is a necessity , gay people should n't be able to marry and to promote employment by raising tariffs is a good idea . 
  that 's a clear case of the bandwagon fallacy . 
   in the usa the minimum wage for the ` better ' states is higher . 
  you 're getting cause and effect wrong , precisely because those states are better they can sustain higher minimum wages . 
  but you do n't even have to look at the usa for that , [ here 's the eu situation ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/15/mw_map_eur_january_2013.png ) . 
  while we 're at it , [ here 's the youth unemployment rate ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/13/youth_unemployment%2c_2011q4_%28%25%29.png ) . 
  see the correlation ? 
   the vast vast majority of nations have a minimum wage that does n't mean anything . 
   ultimately the benefits greatly outweigh the costs which benefits ? 
  higher unemployment ? 
  did n't you see the videos i posted previously ? 
  i do would like to see your argument [ against this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ds0xxfdyfi ) . 
   government is about more than mere neoliberalism and sending everything to the free market . 
  unfortunately the idea of government interventionism in the economy still prevails , sadly we still keep hurting ourselves because of political populism , various degrees of economic central planning , restrictive business regulations , the influence of special interest groups on decision making and the widely held belief that society can get a free lunch through government . 
   oh lord , that 's terrible . 
  d : especially that hammering at the start . 
  [ perhaps you 'll enjoy this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgpzgu9yp6y ) xd, 
   you 're portuguese so you know very well that if there was no minimum wage in portugal , bosses would just take advantage of it . 
  that argument makes no sense , the vast majority of the people earn higher than the minimum wage . 
  also , i do n't know about you , but i 'm pretty sure that between someone receiving say 400 $ or ca n't find any kind of employment , the whole society and specially that said person would be much better off with a job . 
   the absence of minimum wage makes sense but only in a responsible culture . 
  most countries in europe are n't responsible or serious/honest . 
  that 's silly , people are `` greedy '' everywhere , it 's human nature to try and pursue what 's best for the individual . 
  it 's not a bad thing , anyone can ( or should be able to - we have plenty of restrictive regulate ) become an employer and employers ca n't just `` take advantage '' because they 're dependent on the employees to fulfil a bilateral contract . 
   not sure what that is but i blame the germans . 
  thanks merkel !, 
  the netherlands and belgium too have minimum wages ( 1424/1415 $ as of 2011 compared to spain/greece with 863/748 $ ) and they do n't have an economical crisis . 
  you 're assuming that there are n't other very important variables that affect employment and government spending . 
  anyway , here 's the ratio between the minimum wage and the average wage : netherlands =  1424/2671 = 0.53 belgium =  1415/2496 = 0.57 spain =  863/1888 = 0.46 greece =  748/1250 = 0.60 [ ( source ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_in_europe_by_monthly_average_wage ), 
   though wages , again as you argue , are only one part of the argument . 
  i do n't understand - yes , of course wage controls are only one part of the problem , but still , abolishing those would be a step in the right direction , the fact that there are other problems does n't invalidate this one . 
   minimum wages are about benefitting individuals , not the state 's average . 
  then they should be abolished because they only benefit the unions who get less competition for their labour . 
   if its the same job but with different companies then competition will cause wages to decrease to the minimum . 
  what ? 
  no , it 's the opposite , the more competition there is among companies for labour , the less bargaining power these will have and the more workers will be able to justify as their pay . 
  it 's simple supply and demand of labour , it 's the same reason why when there 's high unemployment wages tend to drop , there 's too high supply for too little demand and the result is that prices ( in this case , wages ) fall . 
   a natural problem of the eu . 
  yes there are theoretically no restrictions , but in reality people from greece do n't want to move en masse to germany . 
  its a different country . 
  that 's way bigger than moving from south carolina to michigan , then to california or massachusetts . 
  you may argue that 's another problem of the eu , i agree it is . 
  geographical problems and the like can hardly be tackled . 
  but what we do can change and get rid of are the man-made restrictions such as the minimum wage and other policies which act against the free market and serve only to promote unemployment . 
   yes bad for unemployed workers , we agree on that . 
  also bad for business because they ca n't employ as many people as before . 
  i do n't understand how you can still support such a short-sighted measures when you acknowledge that it not only fails to achieve its goal of improving the conditions of those who are worse off but that also restricts the ability for workers to find employment and for employers to offer jobs . 
   the drug point was a tag on at the end . 
  you 're absolutely correct , its just something that is used . 
  funnily enough studies show that increasing minimum wages actually increases crime amongst youths and migrants ( the groups that suffer from minimum wage increases ) . 
  well , no wonder , the more you restrict employment , the more people will resort to alternative means to improve their own lives . 
  all the more reason to stop with this bullshit price controls and governmental restrictions in the free market economy . 
   fyi born in east germany shortly after reunification and only moved to bremen 3y ago . 
  you 're silly then , you should have moved to say spain or greece , unlike germany , these countries have high statutory minimum wages , perhaps there you would n't be so exploited . 
   someone working full time and minimum wage where i live will have difficulty paying for an apartment , a car ( which is an absolute necessity here ) , food , and other needs . 
  what if the minimum wage was raised and that someone became unemployed , would that help them in paying for those things ? 
   the reason is also to get away from the trend to employ more people that way . 
  so more employment = bad ? 
   sure people can become unemployable , but not everyone working in a low income job , in the worst case 50 % of those in low income jobs will lose their jobs wtf ? 
  so unemployment among the people who are worst off is good ? 
   unemployed they will still get as much money as when they worked there that 's not up to you to decide . 
  maybe they get some extra benefits , maybe they need the work experience , maybe they do n't want to be on welfare . 
   the only reason they even work at these shitholes of ~ ~ slavery rings ~ ~ companies is , because they would lose there unemployment benefits if they do n't . 
  what about younger workers or inexperienced immigrants ? 
  would you deny them the opportunity to find employment to protect them from themselves and from `` exploitation '' ? 
   also ethically i think that companies who can only survive ( aka : metric fuckton of money for the ceos ) by exploiting their employees have no place in germany ( or any place in europe and the world ) and should not be allowed to exist . 
  i so wish there was still an east germany to allow for people like to you to move there and avoid the `` exploitation '' that arises in a voluntary exchange market system . 
   economic arguments that a minimum wage is a good thing i see no good economic arguments for price controls . 
   if i was arguing against myself i would look into whether the lack of a minimum wage has led germany to have a disproportionate number of foreign workers . 
  what about it ? 
   all the migrants go there thus helping the german economy , whilst the rest of europe with its minimum wages get crippled on labour costs and consequent productivity decline then the rest of europe is to blame . 
  though there are plenty of other eu countries without statutory minimum wages . 
   secondly it prevents worker abuse . 
  without a minimum wage competition could lead private sector wages to decrease to an absolute minimum . 
  it absolutely does not . 
  yes , no minimum wage would lead to lower average wages but it would also lead to higher average incomes . 
  for example : if you have an economy where there 's three people , one earning 500 $ , another 1000 $ and another 1500 $ and you set a minimum wage of 750 $ , you 'll go from a situation where the average wage rises from 1000 $ to 1250 $ but where the average income drops from 1000 $ to 833 $ . 
   the converse could be argued of course , that one employer offers a slightly higher wage and duly hires all the most productive staff . 
  that 's great for business , but i believe its a failure of society if that is the case .
