  italy has been implementing austerity measures , cyprus i wo n't comment much as i know very little other than them being till recently under a communist government and with regards to macedonia , it 's no wonder considering their recent history . 
  as for the netherlands , well , there are other factors that account for this , though they 'd be even better off in this regard without a statutory minimum wage . 
   looking at it , the general economical/social situation ( particularly the strict labour laws ) has far more importance in the general outlook of the job market . 
  i never said it did n't , though to ignore the impact of the minimum wage upon it is outright foolish . 
  to consider that price controls work and that there would be an increase in employment like krattr suggested there would be with higher minimum wages , that 's an hypothesis demolished by reality . 
   spending increased 13 % from 2005 to 2011 that was when s\u00f3crates was in office , austerity only started after that , when his socialist government fell . 
   that is not austerity , that is higher spending . 
  they have not tried austerity yet . 
  so far , we 've had austerity but we 've also had higher taxes , while that might do short term good to public finances , it 's killing the economy . 
  our pm says he 's tackling public debt 1/3 through higher revenues and 2/3 through reduced spending which is why people think austerity is failing , how is the economy meant to grow if you restrict it even more with higher taxation ? 
   no one believes austerity really ? 
  people believe we should slack off and do n't care about minimising state expenditures ? 
   or improve lives the minimum wage does n't achieve that . 
   increase consumption how does limiting employment increase consumption ? 
   thus creating more jobs then why stop at an 8.5 $ / hour ? 
  why not 10 $ / hour or 20 $ / hour or 50 $ / hour ? 
  i mean , if it will only improve lives , increase consumption and create more jobs , we should do more of that , right ? 
  krattr , please explain me this : [ minimum wage per country ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/15/mw_map_eur_january_2013.png ) and [ youth unemployment per country ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/1/13/youth_unemployment%2c_2011q4_%28%25%29.png ) . 
  do you see the correlation ? 
   yes to free trade there , it 's simpler and better like this . 
   i cant remember but i have had you tagged in bright fuchsia `` called me a cunt '' for a while now . 
  lol , i have you tagged as `` brit '' but you must not be very active as your vote weight is quite small . 
  if i ever called anyone a cunt here , that 's easy to check , i do n't edit or delete my posts so you do could prove me wrong :p, 
   edit : it might make sense to have some mods from the other end of the world so as to cover those timezones ( like the us and australia , for example ) . 
  nobody suggested u/koleye ? 
  he 's perfect for the job and he 's in an american timezone !, 
  i 'd support you :p, 
  frisiandude would be a good mod . 
  you too , atomickoala . 
   thanks , mondlicht . 
  i feel honored by your nice words . 
  i would be very glad if i could help and support / r/europe as a moderator . 
  hey ascherbescher , i think you 'd be a good mod . 
  let me take the quiz x )  do you have an immediate reaction to the word `` islam '' ? 
  how does it make you feel ? 
  religion is stupid , do n't bother me with it . 
   what does the skin colour tell us about a person ? 
  the colour of their parents . 
   all roma are ... smelly . 
   adolf hitler was ... a german national socialist who tried to blob too hard and is responsible by the death of millions . 
   i 'm not a racist , but ... 
  i 've never had a roma friend . 
   if need be , i shall do my duty to my fellow euroredditors with pride . 
  you have my full support , 
   i nominate : / u/atheistmil / u/uat2d and / u/jb _ uk nah man , i already spend way too much time here . 
  besides , the three you suggested ( and even yourself ) , all of us held quite liberal views , a mod should be more impartial x ), 
   i can be but that doesnt make it right . 
  you have positive karma from my end and i do n't recall ever saying anyone here to be a cunt , i really do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   / u/uat2d should be disqualified . 
  apparently he called me a cunt . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; when did i called you a cunt ? 
   he seems to have some kind of feud going on with / u/turnusb . 
  i do n't know what it 's about though since they switch to portuguese whenever they meet . 
  it 's quite simple , he 's a commie and sometimes rude with people who disagree with him . 
  :p [ though sometimes we have huge discussions on r/portugal ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.reddit.com%2fr%2fportugal%2fcomments%2f18yja4%2fa_pior_proposta_de_trabalho_de_todo_o_sempre%2fc8j9tkt ) . 
  [ \\ ( original link \\ ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/18yja4/a_pior_proposta_de_trabalho_de_todo_o_sempre/c8j9tkt ) regardless , i do n't want to be a mod here . 
  i 'm flattered that someone suggested me and went positive but no , that 's not something i 'd like to do , i already spend way too much time in here and i 'm too biased with my views to properly mod this reddit xp, 
   do n't agree . 
  i would rather have another more mature unbiased individual as a moderator . 
  someone made a throwaway just for this ? 
  xd regardless , i agree with you , i 'm not mature and unbiased enough for a mod , please do n't make me into one :p, 
   / u/uat2d is an active and as far as i know friendly redditor i 'd vote for . 
  aside from that ... countvontroll maybe but i 'm sure he 's been named already . 
  holy shit , not me , [ i 've been banned from r/europe myself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oigpdnk.png ) , i 'm pretty sure that automatically makes me ineligible for a mod here . 
  besides , it 's not like i 'd want to spend any more time here than i already do , i hardly post content or am unbiased like a mod should be , i just jump in straight for the comments and be myself , being a mod would ruin that . 
   dirty 2nd gen immigrant reporting in . 
  from where ? 
   by the way , the anon activist from the podcast mentions this episode and highly recommends it . 
  thanks for linking it . 
  i watched it again and noticed something very funny - after stan 's last line , in the credits , everybody is either john smith or jane smith !, 
   if you speak german i highly recommend listening to this podcast . 
  an anon activist talks about scientology , it 's very informative and entertaining at the same time . 
  and if you do n't speak german , [ watch this south park episode ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s09e12-trapped-in-the-closet ) . 
   * weather * scientology is that when it rains idiots ? 
   the gold from america was spent in the wars of the austria house against the territories controlled by other powerful european families . 
  and bullshit wasteful luxuries of the kings : hand-made swiss clocks , buildings covered in italian marble , etc. 
  hey , i did n't comment on how wisely that money was spent . 
  spain did got wealthier , despite the life quality of the average spaniard not improving . 
   did n't you know europe = uk + france + spain + italy + germany ? 
  it depends , algeria for example was an awful example , the gold the spanish got from the incas , that was different ( before the inflation kicked in ) . 
  i think from now on we should just assume all meat is horse meat . 
  we 've had enough of this on the news . 
  [ not like you need all that land ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tfrv3zx.gif ) . 
   i ca n't even stand to hear him talk , i had to ask my bf to use earphones if he wanted to listen to political debates with b. 
  damn , how can he be so hated by so many people and still have a chance of winning ? 
   kinda reminds me of this video , where a girl does n't want to shake his hand . 
  he handled it like a pro xd, 
  that 's odd , even if one hates berlusconi , why would anyone ever try to look away and cover the face ? 
  i bet they 've met in the past and she was trying to not be recognized by him in front of the cameras . 
   ufrustratedbro/txampion , now there is a funny troll . 
  nah , not really , he is kinda spammy with `` greece pay debts '' or `` sweden yes '' . 
  joseantoniosaraiva , now that was a great troll , he was original , creative , sometimes not too obvious , and was n't always banging on the same subject . 
   yeah that 's why we do n't wan na join either !, 
  i 'm pretty sure some europeans also have a few reservations with regards to the democratic status of serbia . 
   can we have the eec back please . 
  would n't it just be easier for you to leave the union and unilaterally remove all trade barriers from the eu and then persuade the rest of the union to do the same with the uk ? 
  hey koleye , do you already have eu citizenship ? 
  if not , they should mail it to you . 
   no , but since the op is swedish i bet he eats big , black cock . 
    by the way , western european cuisine will not exist in a few decades .
