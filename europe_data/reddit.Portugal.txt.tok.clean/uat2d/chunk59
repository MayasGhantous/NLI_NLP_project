  looking in his history , he 's in a [ international trade & political science major ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qhty/how_would_this_look_on_a_resume/ ) . 
  he 's also going around [ asking about comparative advantages ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/182uwf/trying_to_wrap_my_head_around_the_concept_of/ ) and about [ finland within the eu ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/finland/comments/18c6nz/so_my_university_landed_finland_for_model_eu/ ) , so it 's just like u/ponimaa said it , he wants us to do his homework for him . 
  i 'm sorry but this is a really stupid proposal , water is like any other commodity and should be privately owned . 
  you really think making it a public good will benefit society ? 
  that we wo n't all pay just the same ( or probably even more ) for the same service ? 
  i mean , what 's the logic behind nationalising water ? 
  do n't get me wrong , if that worked in bringing down the costs , i 'd be the first to sign it , but it just shifts those away and into taxes while also making the people handling the water a lot more unaccountable , the problem is that making it a public good wo n't do us any good , if it did , we 'd all have nationalised water and not only that . 
  one could just as well say `` food/land/transportation / healthcare/internet connection/cellphones/tooth-brushes are a public good , not a commodity '' and that would also make no sense whatsoever . 
   at least your country is n't in a political union with these morons . 
  you really do n't know what we have to put up with sometimes . 
  and you 're in a political union with the uk , if i were you i 'd not only repatriate powers from brussels but also from westminster , let england be free !, 
  i mean , ugh , there are brits who keep on voting labour !, 
  if i were you , i 'd do my best to abolish the uk to stop all this nonsense !, 
   europeans are as economically illiterate as ever . 
  `` but i want free water '' said the average economically illiterate european . 
   when are you people going to forget your soviet indoctrination ? 
  you think people can learn from history ? 
  do n't insult me . 
  no , i 'm on secondment to the sun . 
  [ haha !, 
  you funny guy !, 
   eventually turkey will adopt european culture nope . 
  the whole world is becoming globalised , sure , but let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  sure , your arguments of them becoming an economic power are indeed true , though there 's much more to it . 
  you have the situation in cyprus , you have them bordering iraq and iran and probably going to get involved in syria , you have the whole armenian thingie . . no , they really should n't not be in the eu , we might get more trade deals with them but no abolishing the borders and letting them in fully , that would be quite crazy . 
   as soon as i see your username all the horrible memories come spilling back to me . 
  as if i could do harm !, 
   it must be thrilling to drive on a windy day . 
  [ some people find their thrill there doing some other things ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a73vndzhd0k ) . 
   i think given 5 years turkey should join the eu . 
  let turkey in ? 
  are you insane ? 
  look at their track record , look at their demographics , look at their geopolitical situation . . no , not even in 50 years . 
   so in that case i might as well throw in a few good verbal jabs at your fascists and your hideous anti-democratic ideology . 
  everybody who disagrees with you is an anti-democratic fascist ? 
  geez , i wonder why people downvote you . 
   it used to be much , much better when there were half as many subscribers . 
  we already had rather passionate debates back then , but they were almost always respectful , and we actually tried to understand where people were coming from when they came to a conclusion we did n't agree with . 
  i used to put a lot of effort into commenting here , because i felt it was worth it , and now i do n't feel that anymore . 
    sure , compared to most of the default subreddits , we 're still looking great . 
  but compared to how it used to be , you can definitely see a change for the worse . 
  i 'm pretty sure i do , at least . 
  bah , things were n't that different back then , that 's selective memory at work , back then there was n't the amount of content there is today . 
  though you still raise a very valid point . 
   so what do you have me tagged as ? 
  good or bad , spill the beans !, 
  i have you tagged as someone who plays grand strategy , is australian , centre-left and politically correct . 
  now you do me x ), 
   you know you are in a heavily catholic country when all the news programs have the same opening new and talk about it for 20 minutes . 
  all of them . 
  that or there was n't really anything else that was interesting and worth reporting on . 
  when prince harry and kate middleton got married , the whole thing was all over the news for so long it was actually sickening , and that does n't mean we 're a monarchist country . 
   it would still connect you if you put in the wrong amount of zeroes though . 
  what if you dialled 90 or 9 by accident ? 
   chicago has a population of 2.2 million people . 
  [ population ( 2011 ) : 9,729,825 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicago_metropolitan_area )  greece has a population of 11.2 million people [ population ( 2011 ) : 10,815,197 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece )  greece had 150 murders in 2012 holy fuck , how do you people even get tourists ? 
  portugal had much less than that and also has overall much less criminality !, 
   chicago alone already has 60 murders this year 2013 alone !, 
   greece averages about 100-150 murders a year in the entire country . 
  chicago * caps lock * alone * caps lock * has about the same population as greece ( 10m ) . 
   ~ ~ guns and ~ ~ knives ( of all sizes , even tiny pocket knives ) are completely banned . 
  how do you cut a steak ? 
  with a spoon ? 
   same in germany and france , it 's the downside of being a big market . 
  compare the average german 's english to that of a dutch or scandinavian . 
  both have mother languages that are close relatives of english , but germans grow up with dubbed shows . 
  portugal here , other than the usual , we import tons of shit from brazil and quite a lot from spain . 
  oh , fuck you yoo !, 
   nice try portugal . 
  do you even 6000 islands ? 
  do you even constantinople ? 
   morocco is actually great for an african country , you must try their hash   australia [ has a deadly nature ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p4mfaqs.jpg )  canada is for the most part a barren frozen wasteland . 
   japan tsunamis , fallout , earthquakes and perverted sickos . 
   ireland [ they 're crazy , lad ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rz7iw.jpg ) !, 
   shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeet i think you 're being too influenced by your swedish friends, 
  hey northern europeans , you know what 's even better than greece for tourism ? 
  portugal !, 
  i 'm sorry to say this but it 's true , we 're like greece but more welcoming , safer and cleaner !, 
  [ here , check this map about the safest countries in the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dd9gquc.jpg ) !, 
   and i ca n't even imagine all the people that have been re-allocated to raising statues instead of maintaining the infrastructure . 
  that and the money that will be taken away from the people which would otherwise be spent on productive activity which will now be spent on the megalomaniac buildings , it 's like ceausescu all over again !, 
   oh r/europe , you 're a fucking nazi rally . 
   austria fights about the name of a sausage . 
  you know what we all need ? 
  a common enemy so we stop all this bickering among us . 
   skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost , for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros . 
  they 're only 2 million people and their gdp is only 7630 million euros !, 
  they must be insane !, 
   he is the pm so he knows nobody will look at his finances well what ? 
  he is the pm so he has all the opposition wanting to bring him down and all the media looking for a story , a pm must be of the people in society with the least amount of privacy , everybody is always digging on your past to see if they can find something or anything at all that can be used against you !, 
   this is spain we are talking about even the king has been stealing and i do n't see him steping down . 
  i do n't know about the monarchy but that 's something entirely different - pms are elected , can much more easily be deposed and have much more power . 
   in northern ireland a politician actually blames the ira militant irish republicans replacing beef with horse meat ? 
  ah , that 's just what the jews want you to believe !, 
  sorry , i 'll be back to r/conspiracy now . 
   i do n't know why you are being so downvoted . 
  it 's not like karma acts as currency , do n't worry , i wo n't be loosing sleep over the downvotes i get x )  if with that question , you mean that the taxes would show if he is or not corrupt , that is very naive as they certainly would n't . 
  you 're right , though him making that public certainly means he 's willing to cooperate . 
  heck , he 's the pm , he knows everybody will always be over him to find just the slightest thing to use as a political weapon , if he was indeed corrupt there would be no way he would ever remain in his office for long , think that you 're rajoy and you had indeed taken bribes , would n't you have resigned a long time ago and perhaps even left the country with all these charges coming your way if they were even remotely truthful ? 
  you 'd have to be insane not to , to actually remain in office and to try and deceive everybody with such a bounty on your head if you were indeed guilty of those accusations !,
