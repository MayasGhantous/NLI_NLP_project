  the electorate that still wants more of the same and will continue to vote for ps/d who will continue to try to improve the country with half-baked measures that were the ones that got us where we 're in now in the first place while the population ages and ends up being an extra burden on the welfare system while the young people either end up unemployed , leaving the country or being taxed to death . 
   do you see your own future in portugal ? 
  not if we continue going down this retarded path of ever increasing taxation . 
  no , fuck this , i 'd rather move to somewhere like austria , switzerland , holland or england and work there while saving the most i could till i got enough to come back here and live comfortably considering everything is cheaper here and the money i 'd make would be stored away from the hands of the portuguese government . 
  put your pitchforks down and listen to what he said :  `` we need to examine whether the balance is right in so many areas where the european union has legislated including on the environment . '', 
  what , were you expecting him to have said `` we need to examine whether the balance is right in so many areas where the european union has legislated but not on the environment as that 's fine as it is '' ? 
  so far he has done nothing wrong and did n't propose anything stupid , calm down . 
   who thinks that people will just find work , rather than starve on the streets like in delhi . 
  500,000 spare jobs in uk and 2,500,000 unemployed , probably without the skills or location to do them . 
  people in delhi are in their situation because of the central planning people like you want to institute . 
  if you cut unemployment benefits and housing benefits you 'll also cut the taxes required to pay for those , the end result is a short term increase in unemployment but a long term increase in the productivity and employment as the reduced taxation will allow for more jobs to be created . 
   forgive my ignorance but where do all these european themed sphere 's come from ? 
   edit : i killed portugal and have no regrets [ & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232  ( http://i.imgur.com/cs7bdir.png ), 
   try canada , it 's impossible . 
  i was meant to try it but fuck nunavut , yeah , that 's the reason why i only posted the usa , mexico south of the border would be fine but canada screws things up . 
   i kinda pity you man , 62 ... shit , that 's just ... low . 
  i live in a 157 , ca n't imagine how different everything must be , even accounting for purchasing power parity . 
  dude , the north of the country is huge , i do n't know why they got everything in the same nut . 
  portugal is very unevenly divided between the coast and the interior . 
  i live in [ porto ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/wizty ) , it 's the [ second largest city ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porto ) in portugal , it 's a massive [ metropolitan area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porto_metropolitan_area ) and it has [ the largest university in the country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_porto ) of which i 'm a student . 
  the coast and specially porto just is n't comparable to the rest of the north like [ tr\u00e1s-os-montes ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/mk5z6 ) . 
  instead of looking at the gdp per [ nut ii ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/c/cd/gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_2_regions%2c_2009_%28%25_of_the_eu-27_average%2c_eu-27%3d100%29.png ) , look at it from [ nut iii ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/0/01/gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_3_regions%2c_2009_%281%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-27_average%2c_eu-27%3d100%29_map.png ) , you can see porto is between 75 % to 100 % , sure , it 's not like what you have going on there but do n't act all patronising , really , i have a good life . 
  if there 's something i dislike more than pity is when it 's unfounded , really , [ this is the city i live in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p6e0dgm.jpg ) and [ here 's another pic taken from city hall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/okyv4yw.jpg ) . 
  really , this city is great , i love it here and will gladly live here all my life provided that i find employment , something like 1000 $ / month would be more than enough for me to live here well enough . 
  this is where i 've been all my life , it 's where all my friends are and life is good . 
  also , purchasing power parity accounts for a lot , just the other day i went out to dine with my friends and i paid only 8 $ for two full plates ( it was a buffet so i ate all i could - it was great ) and the beverages were all you could drink ( i stopped at about the 10th pint , i got so fucking wasted even though it was just sangria ) , really dude , with that amount of money one can hardly pay for dessert there , chill , this really is n't poor-and-depressing-fuckistan , for example , here 's a clip from last year 's [ queima das fitas ( watch out , it 's very loud ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqogtcsvnq ) :p so long story short , please do n't feel pity in the slightest as you really should n't !, 
   ok , but overall wealthy for the region . 
  what 's the gdp per cap do you know ? 
  i could n't find it . 
  [ pdf ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/1-24022011-ap/en/1-24022011-ap-en.pdf ) hey , i just found out i 'm in the poorest region of portugal , 62 if the eu average is 100 . 
  damn . 
   is n't madeira poor as shit though ? 
  it 's actually wealthier than the eu average and in portugal is only behind lisbon . 
  though they got into a massive debt and it we 'll be all of those the ones who 'll have to pay for it , so yeah , they build tons of shit and the whole country picks up the bill even though the country is on average poorer . 
  koleye , drawing europe from memory is too hard , here , [ check my drawing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3urghx6.png ) , it 's an easier one xd, 
  bah , it 's only a small peninsula , the map was made from memory and is extremely simplified . 
  heck , he made scotland , the aegean and the baltic and the adriatic very very well for someone doing it from memory !, 
  you do n't see me saying that portugal is n't a rectangle , that [ there is stuff like cabo da roca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabo_da_roca ) x ), 
   i just find him a bit overrated . 
  i mean his movies are definitely watchable , but none of them are actual works of art . 
  to be honest , even as a sci-fi aficionado i find t2 to be boring and unimaginative . 
    yes , his movies have excellent special effects , and for all it 's being said against it avatar was immersive and nice to look at . 
  but in the end none of his films has a truly good story . 
  they 're just glorified popcorn flicks . 
   where is hel ? 
  ;[ hell is right there , in the middle of poland . 
   so why is he in the closet ? 
  [ you 'll have to ask him ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pup2dkn.jpg ) . 
   nothing really . 
  i really do n't like his positions on most things , but lately due to all of the uk out of the eu thing , there 's an anti-cameron feeling around / r/europe that 's nonsense , he 's just doing what his electorate demands of him , it would n't be politically beneficial for him to not give the referendum . 
  besides , he 's being quite reasonable with his objectives and he 's going to give the british people a chance for deciding for themselves what course they should take while also quite obviously pursuing a pro-europe route - what he 's doing , he 's doing out of the necessity . 
  i really am not the most knowledgeable person on this matter but david cameron is quite well on my book . 
  he 's acting all tough but it 's an act he has to play . 
  he 's certainly better than other european leaders such as hollande who may bring the whole eu down if he continues to fuck up like he 's fucking up with the french economy and not allowing the reform of some eu aspects like cap which ends up being a massive waste or the strasbourg parliament everyone wants to get rid off but they wo n't allow it . 
   haha - typical . 
  the dog who barks the loudest ... . . not really , iirc he said he opposed the legalisation at the time but he 's not one of those crazies that want to outlaw it now or anything , he 's actually quite moderate , i do n't think he even touched the subject again ever since these were allowed . 
  but then again he also probably does n't want to alienate himself for voters from any side considering he 's the leader of the party that keeps swinging between the strong two and that in our constitution it says discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is n't allowed so yeah , he may be in charge of the party that 's against it but he is n't barking about the issue . 
   have an upvote for quoting cameron on a positive note . 
  it 's hard to find such thing these days around here . 
  what 's wrong with cameron ? 
  you can come to portugal and get married here . 
  when talking about gdp , the margin of error is often greater than 0.3 % . 
  people should have the right to claim compensation from service providers if their internet access is disrupted because they 're paying for it and they 're not getting the service they paid for . 
  the internet being an essential part of life is certainly odd , though i 'm sure we can all relate . 
   i guess they 'd have to change the name of northern ireland . 
  western ireland . 
  ladies and gentleman , this is what happens when you fail to liberalise the market . 
   old grumpy people who want to be supported in their `` those damn kids and their computer games '' mentality . 
  [ that can lead to odd situations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tj9fk.jpg ) . 
   well , he 's right . 
  not that it 's a bad thing , though . 
  most of our stereotypes are kind of friendly or at least not meant to be mean and it 's kind of funny when we pick on each other and then all of a sudden an american appears and screams `` omg racism !!!!! '', 
  even though we 're just like kittens playing ( which can look rough too but actually is n't ) . 
  [ that 's racist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr3kptg93oa ) . 
  you 're right . 
  i never thought of that . 
  i guess that 's just the more reason for me to support a system like the swiss , the representatives have reduced power and it 's not the political parties but the people the ones who have the power , when there are problems they just call on a referendum and deal with the issue . 
  reading this kind of news after hearing about the whole debate on gun control going on across the pond is quite odd . 
   north europe will live a new golden era you could say it will be ... [ a golden dawn ] ( http://mirrors.rit.edu/instantcsi/ ) . 
   state costs ? 
  why would the state need to pay anything ? 
  if it 's state-owned , then there are costs associated to it . 
   and as to the efficiency of the private sector , that 's a big [ citation needed ] . 
  and to propose that the state is more efficient than the private sector , that 's a big fat lie . 
   fuck encouraging efficiency , am i right ? 
    it 's not like you can also own big businesses if you want to ... iirc , some time ago you comment on a post of mine here saying that after a while you knew what regulars on r/europe stood for and that i was an exception , that i was silly and you did n't have an idea of what i believe in ? 
  yeah , i think it was you . 
  well , in any case , you 're absolutely right . 
  these people are all getting carried away fighting the invisible monster that is big business by feeding the much more visible and dangerous monster that is big government . 
   come back to #europe , have n't seen you there in a while . 
  sorry , for now i really must not , this is exam season and i already distract myself more than i should here on reddit . . :( btw , what 's your username there ? 
   i had an old lady shout at me in a bus when in sweltering heat i dared open a window in the back of the bus while she was sitting in the front . 
  `` do you want to kill me ? '', 
  i would if an old lady shouted at me like that . 
   you will when your water bill doubles in a month ... just like it did in the uk ? 
  oh right , it did n't . 
   water supply is a prime example of a natural monopoly and for what we , around here , call `` daseinsf\u00fchrsorge '' . 
  those public services that must be provided , in general by the municipality , for life to exist in a meaningful way in the first place . 
  or allow the private sector to provide and set a price limit . 
  all the efficiency of the private sector , none of the costs for the state .
