  we also need to start regulating sarcasm , your levels are off the charts :p, 
   i like how ireland remains completely unchanged . 
  same thing with us , and we outnumber you 2 to 1 . 
  imo , that 's just the more reason for the votes belonging to the people and not the territories . 
   yes it is closer and you can see regional borders . 
  germany , france , spain are just to big for a federal country . 
  for example population : baden-w\u00fcrttemberg 10.7 mio and portugal 10.5 mio that 's ok , we 're ( or at least i am ) fine with having the same voting power as someone from baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , we 're both europeans and have the same goals and objectives . 
  besides , what kind of an union would it be where a portuguese would have a stronger vote than a german but a weaker vote than an irish ? 
  the sovereignty should belong to the people , not the territory . 
  with regards to issues that pertain to the eu , it should be democratic , one person should equal one vote . 
  i do n't understand , the 2nd picture is just a closer up version of the 1st one , no ? 
  most of the smaller nation states wo n't let themselves be drowned by the larger nations like germany and france . 
  that logic is similar to proposing a breaking up of denmark because [ nordjylland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_denmark_region ) is much less populated than [ hovedstaden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_region_of_denmark ) . 
  sure , denmark has been closer together for longer and is much more homogeneous , but that was not your argument . 
  let 's not forget : greece got into the mess they 're in by themselves and they voluntary accepted all the loans they made . 
  also ( and unfortunately for me ) portugal . 
  though we 'll pay up everything with interest and all , we just need time to carry out the reforms that will allow us to reduce our public spending and give chance for our economy to grow . 
   it is paying with its labour and taxes . 
  if it 's paying it with labour then they are being remunerated and agree to the terms of the employment , so that 's no issue . 
  if it 's paying it with taxes then you 're right , we should be slashing taxes so that they can only be used in keeping the public services working properly , not in funding these people . 
   yeah , if we need anything then it 's more laws and regulation . 
  i hope you 're being sarcastic . 
  i wish portugal had your levels of regulation . 
  in other news , major political parties in britain still want to be elected into office . 
   do you reckon we could call it the confederate states of europe , just to piss off our friends across the atlantic ? 
  nah , we ca n't be that confrontational , we need to be much more subtle . 
  i 'd say that if we reform into the european confederation on the 24th of august ( preferably next year , so that it would be exactly 200 years after [ 24/8/1814 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august_24 ) ) , and make that day an holiday with fireworks and big celebrations all over europe . 
  sure , it could be a bit morbid for us to be partying on the birthday of the burning of washington , but it would just be an unfortunate coincidence for them , would n't it ? 
   i realise the difference is largely semantic , but i think any form of federalisation will be done on a very loose level . 
  that 's called a confederation . 
   well , the fact that it worked for switzerland does n't mean it will work for eu , right ? 
  considering that they also have different cultures and languages among the different cantons and they 're all just fine , i 'd say it would be fine here as well . 
   and we never did anything serious about it ... morocco declared war on us a couple times . 
  [ how that felt like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0jwhayi.jpg ) . 
   ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ok , ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ miss ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ relevant ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ own . 
   getting pretty sick of the empire shit all the time . 
  but do you miss it ? 
   keep the masses calm as the wealth transfer continues we 're talking about switzerland here . 
   well , yeah , but it 's still a pic of him after a plane crash . 
  it 's only funny till someone is injured . . after that , then it gets hilarious !, 
   did you reply to the wrong person ? 
  i have no idea what you 're lisping furiously about . 
  he 's simonask , that 's him calm . 
  call him a sissy , that will calm him down . 
   you do n't set things just because of a name . 
  it 's just a name . 
  that 's what they said about mtv or the history channel . 
  op should be sent to the gulags for its treason . 
   i do not trust eu politicians since many of them are from countries with far more amount of corruption then the shitty politicians we already have in sweden . 
  i do n't trust my neighbours and yet they 're allowed to vote . 
   why should i want my country to in a union where the majority of leaders are right wing ? 
  why should you want your city to be in a country where the majority of the leaders do n't support < insert something you support  ? 
   wonder why they did that ? 
  i dunno , maybe it has something to do with the name of the union , that could be it . . 
   never said there shouldnt be a government . 
  i just think there is a smaller chance that our politican will be bribed if they can only make decision about sweden then if the politicans would make decision about the whole eu have you ever heard of the [ principle of subsidiarity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsidiarity#general_principle_of_european_union_law ) ? 
   and yeah i considered super pacs = corruption and if you need 1billion $ to get re-elected then the system is fucked up . 
  fortunately for us , there are caps in terms of the spending allowed in politics . 
   but if they want to and they ** meet the criteria ** then fine . 
  [ about that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria#geographic_criteria ) ... 
  spoiler alert : it will fail . 
   eu = ussr [ what the shit ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l252kwq.jpg ) oh , and if the eu was like the ussr , perhaps we 'd be [ this awesome ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ydrtner_5m ) . 
   sounds about right ... that might be taking the principle of `` that government is best which governs least '' a bit too far , that would be anarchy . 
  saying no government is the best cure for corruption is like saying death is the best cure for an illness . 
   the popular mood 's just about on the side of staying in europe - but federalisation ? 
  you must be mad . 
  well , that 's where this train is headed , to an ever closer union among the peoples of europe , it said so right in the first paragraph of the original eec treaty . 
   the more power eu gains the more money people can earn from bribing the officials which means it will lead to more corruption ( just look at usa , didnt obama spend around 1 billion $ to get reelected ? ), 
  so to prevent corruption , there should be no government officials or no government at all ? 
  and political campaigns are now considered corruption ? 
   wait , what ? 
  you mean the city of london which generates nearly 10 % of our gdp ? 
  yeah , i 'm guessing he was exaggerating , actual blackholes are heavier than that . 
   politics is guided by society , not economics . 
  the way you 're talking , it 's as if the uk was a socialist country . 
   the most gratitude a western leader can almost ever reach is having children named in your honour . 
  my first name is jos\u00e9 , just like jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates or jos\u00e9 manuel dur\u00e3o barroso . . coincidence ? 
  i hope so !, 
   your `` explain '' made me think this will be a long night . 
  but then gladly i read your second sentence ; yes , that sums it up neatly . 
  then i 'm sorry but no , you 're the one who does n't know what he 's talking about . 
   plus , in english `` that feel '' really ought n't be accepted , dammit , it 's `` that feeling '' . 
  [ epic fail ] ( http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=epic ), 
  :p what , the acronym or 4chan ? 
  the acronym is fine , i guess . 
  4chan is on only shitty if you browse the main boards though that 's the same with reddit , the default reddits here are also disgusting . 
   what the fuck does tfw mean ? 
  d : [ that feel when ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7qzdyhu.png ) , it 's a common acronym on 4chan . 
   until you ascend to the libertarian master race libertarian ? 
  but i believe in a strong state . 
  hey remember me back in the day when i had the anarchy flag ? 
  yup , i 'm still me . 
  sorry for the way things turned out , tugasnake , i know how you just despise neoliberals xd  do not speak about based austrian economics granted , i am quite illiterate in that regard , but i 'm getting myself educated in keynes and fuck , the guy was a genius , really , i wish i understood more of the theory so that i could explain it to others such as yourself !, 
  xd remember when i pmd you * the wealth of nations * ? 
  i hope you 're through reading that because * the general theory of employment , interest and money * must be amazing ( i still read none of those lol ) !, 
  a wise monetary policy like the one that goes on in the ecb , that helps us quite a lot !, 
  as for ron paul , yeah , he has his reasons , i 'd perhaps vote for someone like him if there was some ben bernanke in the eu though that 's not the case and so i 'm happy with the way things are . 
  oh , and if you fucking confuse the real keynes with those like krugman that shit on his grave or if you ca n't distinguish between the keynesian monetary policy i 'm arguing for with the neo-keynesian fiscal policy , well , i 'm gon na break your shit for being as economically illiterate as the syndies and the communes . 
  now on a more serious tone , keynesian fiscal policy and austrian fiscal policy are incredibly similar , my issue with the austrian school is the monetary policy .
