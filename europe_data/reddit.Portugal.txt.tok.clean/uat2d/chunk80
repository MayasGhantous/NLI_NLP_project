   as a deaf guy , going blind is one of my biggest fears . 
  as an healthy guy , i also would n't want to go blind . 
   are you a muslim or just a troll ? 
  [ it was merely an act ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmczn.jpg ) . 
  i do n't get it , do they really want to leave the uk but continue using the pound sterling ? 
   / s this makes you sound like an idiot . 
   arguably if napoleon had kept his nerve he 'd have secured spain and the french empire would have covered france , spain , italy and most of germany into today . 
  what ? 
  if napoleon had kept his nerve he would have never back-stabbed spain in the first place !, 
  oh , and to think they 'd ever get to keep it when nationalism was so strong , that 's insane , guerilla warfare would n't have died now , spain on its own is massive , if not even the castilians can keep the rest of the regions cooperative , imagine france trying to keep things working there . 
  and spain was just one of many places napoleon attacked , to thing he 'd ever be able to secure it and also italy and most of germany , that 's utter nonsense . 
   ` rance fuck yeah more like rancid . 
   lol how the guy hitting the chick . 
  maybe it 's just me getting soft , i dunno . . 
  i 've been to r/beatingwomen and at the time i did n't really feel bad , but the gift you just posted made me feel bad inside : x, 
  how come turkey do that ? 
  why would they want to be more like the rest of the middle east and less like europe ? 
  dude , that gif is just wrong , i know it 's just an act but it 's still sickening : x, 
  why is that every urban dictionary definition has sexual innuendo ? 
   ** it does not really matter if britain leaves **   * the idea of the uk at the heart of the eu is bizarre *   should the uk remain at the heart of europe ? 
    if you believe that this is where the uk is actually located , then the answer may well be yes . 
  but then you would either look at it from a very long distance -- the us state department for example -- or suffer from perspective distortion . 
    looking at this from inside the eu , the uk left the heart of europe 20 years ago when john major negotiated the opt-out from the euro . 
  tony blair confirmed that position when his government took the opt-out in the later 1990s . 
  it is completely unsurprising that there is now a debate inside the uk about membership . 
  people are asking themselves a perfectly logical question : since we are not in the eurozone , nor likely ever to become a member , what is the point ? 
    in macroeconomic terms , eu membership is virtually irrelevant for a member state that is simultaneously large and not in the eurozone . 
  the eu budget is tiny , and free trade and free capital movement would continue under any conceivable scenario . 
  there may be reasons to stay in the eu , but whatever they are , they are not macroeconomic . 
    if you go one level down -- to the level of individual industries , including finance -- the impact of eu membership is more subtle . 
  but here it is important to take a realistic look at how the eu itself will develop in the next 10 years , and not romanticise the liberal , free-trade eu of the past , when mario monti or lord brittan were still european commissioners . 
    over the next 10 years , the eu will mostly deal with the institutional consequences of the eurozone crisis , deepen eurozone integration , and change european treaties to make that possible . 
    in the agreement on banking union , the uk has secured a protection from being outvoted on matters relating to bank supervision . 
  but the eurozone will find a way to usurp this and other single-market powers . 
  a hint of that recently came from christian noyer , governor of the bank of france , when he said the eurozone would not allow the city of london to dominate euro-related securities trading forever . 
    i doubt that eu membership could ultimately protect the uk from an inevitable eurozone power grab . 
  a single market in a single-currency regime is a very different beast than a single market in a customs union . 
  in the first category the purpose is adjustment of wages and prices ; in the second it is free trade . 
  italy needs a single european labour market . 
  the uk does not . 
    what , then , would the uk leave behind by leaving the eu ? 
  membership confers a series of fundamental freedoms -- of movement of labour , goods and services and capital . 
  member states are part of a customs union and , of course , an unfinished single-market project , one that has stalled long before it has been completed . 
  britain may be able to maintain several of these benefits : not the customs union , but most of the rest . 
    the common foreign and security policy has not lived up to the exaggerated expectations of the past decade . 
  even here , it may be possible , and in everybody 's best interest , to maintain some form of engagement and co-operation . 
  but is it important enough to make a compelling case for continued membership ? 
    what about the uk beneficiaries of eu funds -- universities , for example ? 
  as a net contributor to the eu 's budget , the uk would be able to compensate any institution , and still have some money left . 
    a genuine complication would be a prior decision by scotland to leave the uk in a referendum that will most likely take place next year . 
  any hypothetical uk referendum would happen afterwards . 
  if scotland were to vote for independence , the situation would get messy . 
  the legal services of all the three main eu institutions believe that by formally leaving an existing member state , a region would also formally exit the eu . 
  like any european country , scotland would have the right to reapply , but any one member state could veto a scottish application . 
  i can not currently see the required unanimity for admitting an independent scottish state , not when other countries , such as spain , are also fighting regional nationalism . 
    the two straightforward solutions would be : scotland leaving the uk , and both the rump-uk and scotland also leaving the eu . 
  or scotland staying inside the uk , and the uk staying inside the eu . 
  but we could end up with england inside and scotland outside , or vice versa . 
  in the last two cases , england and scotland would have to re-erect a customs border between them -- which would be absurd . 
    the best reason to stay in the eu is not a pretence to be in the heart of europe , but to keep things simple , and maybe to have the flexibility to change one 's mind about the euro later on -- if the political or economic situation were to change . 
  but in that case , the uk could always be readmitted , so even that is not a compelling argument . 
    my overall conclusion is that the discussion about eu membership is about barely visible shades of grey . 
   this worked well in 1950 with a much less globalized world . 
  but now everything is more mobile : people , money , capital . 
  tell that to france . 
  oh right , you do n't have to tell them anything , now they know !, 
   fix your basic human rights like equality regardless sexual orientation ? 
   if seen in a globalized context ( which is always much slower progress as people might think ; workers do n't simply go work abroad and businesses do n't simply move ) you could see minimum wages as somehow `` competing '' . 
  though i would still be careful with that because a productive worker in germany that works for $ 10/hour will still be more valuable than an $ 6/hour european who does n't have the same tools and equipment as germany . 
  minimum wage affects overall wage cost , just like many regulations do , but is just a part of the determining factor . 
  the main reason for example why germany managed to drop unemployment after the hartz reforms was not because of the absence of minimum wage but because of simply , a drop in wages . 
  which makes more sense . 
  compared with germany 's historically high productivity this was pretty effective . 
  greece on the other hand is one of the most unproductive countries in europa but kept wages high with debt . 
  which became a road to disaster . 
  for someone with lenin in the username and who is so critical of my views , i do n't understand , you 're not some blinded ideologue , you actually still have your feet on the ground and think clearly - why do you have your views ? 
  i say this because you 're absolutely right . 
   and i do n't deny social mobility , but it 's irrelevant . 
  there 's always only one group of people that take economic decisions , and i do n't see why capitalist class should be a dirty word , as capital is the basis of their power . 
  why do we need to be talking about socialists and capitalists ? 
  why not talk about the people in a democracy ? 
  switzerland can do it with a very direct democracy that leaves very little room for corporatists or communists to take advantage . 
   btw , it 's not because we agree on this that i support dropping wages to solve unemployment . 
  because as a result of economic globalism this means an infinite downward spiral that will only lead to the proletarisation of the middle class . 
  no , it 's about supply and demand . 
  there 's no infinite downward spiral , there 's only readjustments in the market . 
  while some jobs end up being replaced by machinery , new jobs come along as we constantly innovate - unemployment will never be 0 % but it will never be 20 % . 
   as in ~ ~ all liberating ideologies ~ ~ ** everything ** there are people who aim for personal gain . 
  there , ftfy . 
  so it 's not only in communism and socialism , though in these cases it tends to be worse as the leaders then get to seize all of the power and absolute power corrupts absolutely . 
   to see communism as a ploy though is silly . 
  while it might start with real concerns , genuine frustration and legitimate grievances , it always escalates that , you know how it is , once someone is in charge it 's only natural for them to do what they can to benefit themselves . 
  and if you do n't think the dear leader is the perfect representative of the people you 're a counter-revolutionary , enjoy summary execution for being a traitor . 
   and no , economic progress under socialism was n't negative . 
  the greatest catch up movements were done by socialist regimes wether you like it or not . 
  so people starved and there was economic progress ? 
  seems to me you have a very twisted view of progress . 
  no , there was never any great leap forward in any socialist regime . 
  not with regards to life quality , i 'll tell you that for sure . 
   what they want to destroy was the oppressive economic relationships and poverty resulting from it , which they did .
