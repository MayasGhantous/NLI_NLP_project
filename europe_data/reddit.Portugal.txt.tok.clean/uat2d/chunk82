  you 're only giving me reason , precisely because we have those companies that take advantage of their position we have to liberalise the market , so that the ones that succeed are not those who have the strongest voice in government but instead those that are more successful in the market and most benefit society . 
  while there 's the restrictions we have to entry in the market , you 'll have those distortions and the harm that comes alongside them . 
   and it 's not like the troika business is just a way of funneling german taxpayers money into their own banks so they do n't get responsibility for the risky deals they made . 
  oh , that 's right , they deal with trillions but had no idea that they were being fooled by greece and just gambled , sorry , invested unwisely . 
  as for the troika , we ca n't really complain much as it was socrates that called them in . 
  if we had kept our budget balanced , they would never be here in the first place . 
   believe what you want , i 've given up hope anything will change until catastrophe strikes in a few months , anyway . 
  a few decades later maybe people will have learned that letting ~ ~ companies ~ ~ ** politicians ** do what they want is bad , so a few more ~ ~ rules ~ ~ ** new faces ** go up , and the cycle begins again with new ~ ~ loopholes ~ ~ ** ways of cheating the taxpayer ** . 
  there , ftfy . 
   look it up ? 
  language changes , and that is not the definition that is applied in practice , so i wo n't use it . 
  just because people say pluto is still a planet , that does n't change reality . 
  the case is the same here , austerity means cutting public spending , not raising taxes . 
   everyone uses it wastefully , mate . 
  the market does not make things efficient by magic , only when there 's strong competition and rights leveling for the case of weak parties . 
  which is why we must free the market , to minimise the waste created by monopolies ( be them privately or state owned ) . 
   and no , you ca n't always use it better because you 're a much weaker party in negotiations and do n't deal in volume . 
  when americans have a serious disease , there 's not even negotiation , they pay or they die . 
  it 's not even always clear what 's happening until after the fact , like the ridiculous amount of money a degree costs , but for many careers , there 's no choice either . 
  that 's why there 's insurance for healthcare . 
  oh , and between someone paying 500 $ if he gets sick and paying 1000 $ in taxes or paying 0 $ if he gets sick and paying 1500 $ in taxes , the overall picture is the same , the government acting as insurance is n't an argument for nationalisation . 
   some things can be fixed with laws , others by the state being the primary provider . 
  but if you 're going to go the law route , it has to have teeth , it has to be able to close companies and it has to be able to put people in jail . 
  the law should always prevail . 
  and we already have a massively inefficient state . 
  the best choice is obvious , let the private sector handle it and , at most , regulate it when it proves necessary ( like in the case of a natural monopoly , though these are few rare ) . 
   hollywood also achieves drm and ridiculous copyright terms , while mostly recycling old shit every year . 
  color me unimpressed . 
  yeah , you 're right , it was a bad example . 
  though if you read the link i gave you from bastiat , he provides better ones . 
  the point being , you do n't need to subsidise these activities for them to exist . 
   there are things that private companies are just not interested in doing because they are not profitable , but that have an unknowable value for the future . 
  i 'm not a cultural man , so it 's hard for me to say what , but i can point out that without the state interfering there would not be the internet or the many innovations that came from nasa . 
  actually the internet came because of the yanks research during the cold war so that they 'd still be able to launch a counter-attack if their hq was destroyed , hardly a good example for good government research as it was the private sector that adapted it for civilian use . 
   i think pbs and bbc do a great job that is n't necessarily profitable , and certainly rtp had the fairest reporting in the media . 
  of course , imho . 
  yeah , though that opinion of yours does n't justify the massive burden it creates on the taxpayers whereas sic and tvi provide just the same service and they do n't need your funding . 
  you could have more money in your pocket at the end of the moment , that money would then be used to satisfy your needs and the employment of someone else doing a service you might value much more than rtp and that 's just not possible because the state takes that money away from you so that jorge gabriel and the like are paid their wages even though goucha and the like on the other stations also do the same and not at the expense of society . 
   anyone can be a manager in an hour , and there 's no lack of small business here . 
  what happens is lack of oversight over the public offices and most of the money ends up being funneled to things we do n't need or are too expensive , but is both a big and small government problem . 
  banks certainly do n't help . 
  the point i was trying to make was that if the government did n't require so much bureaucracy , employment would go down and the productivity would go up . 
  opening a business here is a nightmare and it should n't be . 
   if they do n't work you can fire them for free . 
  i fail to see how being able to fire people who do good work for whatever you want is an issue . 
  because nobody is that obvious . 
  you ca n't fire someone because he spends too much time on the coffee machine , constantly goes to the bathroom or spends more time chatting with co-workers as opposed to actually working . 
  employers should be free to hire and fire at will , workers should never be able to work less at the expense of the company and with the safeguard that it 's too costly to fire them , even though there might be much more productive people out there that are unemployed and ca n't find employment because even though they work better , it 's too costly to fire those who already have worked there for years . 
   oh , yes , with the huge salaries managers like to pay , i 'm sure all they lack is a push . 
  and we all know everyone is cut out to be a business owner , why should we even have employees in this country , especially ones who can have a comfortable life ? 
  that 's terrible !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  i 'm just saying , if you facilitate the conditions for creating employment , more people will . 
  you wo n't have the emigration you currently have where people out of university ca n't find a job and ca n't create a company and then go outside to do just that . 
   there 's tons of startups , connected to universities or not , and most of the business in portugal are very small , so i do n't get what problem you 're trying to correct . 
  then why is our youth unemployment so high ? 
  and how many of those startups are successful ? 
   that is state dependent , some are not like that at all . 
  that creates terrible work conditions , anyway . 
  i 've heard they offer other ways for people to get on their feet that we do n't , but i admit i have n't researched it . 
  however ... their conditions are better than ours . 
  we really need to reduce unemployment to give workers a bigger bargaining position , while we do n't , you 're right , it 's hard to negotiate in equal terms with employers . 
   right , like outsourcing to india is n't a huge thing in your role models , which is quickly increasing their unemployment rates . 
  and it 's common to fire people who want a vacation , or people who want to go to a funeral . 
  it 's not even unheard of to fire sick or pregnant people here , let alone in the us , regardless of how well they worked before . 
  that 's nonsense , companies that do that only lose out , if they want to survive in the market , they ca n't do that as that 's not beneficial for them . 
  oh , and all the laws of the world wo n't prevent you from some assholes doing just that , if they ca n't cut on the wage or on the vacation , they 'll cut somewhere else , so let 's not bother with those as they always get what 's coming to them . 
   there 's very little incentive to keep someone who is n't going to be productive for a while if you have to keep pulling your numbers up to have you yearly bonus , especially since you 'll be long gone using your `` skills '' elsewhere when the shit hits the fan . 
  that 's a common ceo path . 
  yes , and that 's how it 's supposed to be . 
  if someone 's productive , they get to be employed , if not , they should be the burden of the company , at most they should be a burden to their families and society . 
  attaching the misfortunes of some to the company is n't safeguarding the well being of the poor fellow , is jeopardising the employment of everybody who works in said company . 
   that 's not how people work , period . 
  and people have sickness , depression family problems and all kinds of issues all the time that are only going to be amplified by further stress . 
  again , that 's life , you should n't continue to work in a private company if you ca n't do your job any more just like a policeman ca n't continue to patrol the street if he can no longer perform his job . 
  if there 's misfortunes , it should never be at the expense of the company , at most it should be something the whole society should take care off . 
   if they could n't before , they can certainly be easily fired for a few years now , so i do n't get what you 're complaining about . 
  a few years from now ? 
  what if i need to cut costs now , what , should 150 people lose their job because somehow that 's better than the 5 less productive people losing theirs ? 
   regardless , what you can always do is declare bankruptcy and then restructure however you want , with no issue from the courts . 
  so we should going around the system and do all that nonsense because it 's somehow evil or something to fire people ? 
  i wonder how history would pan out if the republicans won the civil war . 
  here our transition to republic was relatively quiet and swift though the system was unstable and only 16 years later it fell also quietly and swiftly into an authoritarian regime , so it 's not like it was that successful , but it was better than what went on there . 
  oh , and i still do n't have such a negative view of juan carlos . 
  sure , monarchies are a thing of the past , nor do i think the spanish monarchy will last much longer after his death , but still , you have to give him some credit , no ? 
   i ascribe it to corruption of city officials . 
  then you ca n't blame the privatisations if corruption takes place and justice does n't prevail , shady businesses can happen both with the private as with the public sector . 
   the czech government had never ever stepped in and set any limit on water prices , afaik . 
  well , if it 's a natural monopoly , it should . 
  if it 's just a monopoly , then it should liberalise the entry to the market to allow for competition that will drive the prices down . 
   then , you can pay his whores with your money if you want . 
  hey , dude , calm down , i 'm just offering my view from this side of the border , the criticism you present of him is still not much when compared to what we have going on , that 's what i 'm trying to point out . 
   never !, 
  your bros are already in the club , do n't worry , we 'll keep a seat warm while you cash in the oil money x ), 
  [ there 's the eu , there 's the soon to be eu and then there 's ocean ] ( http://i.imgur.com/waapf.png ) . 
   here if i want water in a hotel or restaurant , i have to buy it i 'm pretty sure nobody will deny you water even if you do n't have any money . 
  i think they doing that would even be unlawful ( ? ) . 
  when i was a kid i 've went to several coffee shops and asked the man if he could give me a glass of water despite me not having any money and nobody ever refused . 
  i can confirm he 's greek , i have him tagged as such x ) he 's a cool guy though, 
   he stood pretty beside franco while he murdered political prisoners i 'm pretty sure he 'd be one of those prisoners if he tried to mess with franco .
