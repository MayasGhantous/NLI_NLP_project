  portugal is in trouble because of public deficits that stacked up and the debt is now huge . 
  not because of the euro , not even close . 
   well , that 's the thing - is it wrong to cast skepticism on eu drafts and proposals instead of just blindly accepting them ? 
  especially when it comes to money ? 
  the eu is an institution that has failed it 's own monetary audit for 17 years in a row . 
  blind acceptance ? 
  you 're not meant to do any such thing , you 're meant to take part in the decision making and getting out of it saying `` we managed to get a deal that will improve x and y '' and not `` we managed to get an ( other ) opt-out clause '' . 
  with regards to fiscal and monetary policy , the fiscal policy is still set on a national level and the eu monetary policy is fine as it currently is . 
   i want to reiterate that it 's not just the uk that 's doing this either ( yet it feels like the uk gets blamed the most ) , but this is why this 2 speed europe thing could be an answer . 
  let the guys that want to speed things along do so , and then they do n't have to listen to anyone who says otherwise . 
  it 's the uk the one who systematically alienates itself and acts as if the eu was out to harm it , which i still do n't get why . 
  as for the two speed europe , that seems like no union at all , what would be the point a commitment that was n't worth the paper it was written on ? 
  why is that the uk acts as if it 's not in its best self-interest to act with together with the eu in this globalised world when we have shared goals ? 
   i understand that euro as a currency is burden on poorer nations , but that is no excuse to elect the kind of morons the greeks are electing right now . 
  is it ? 
  i 'm thankfully that we have the euro , otherwise we 'd have devalued our currency massively by now ( like we did before the euro ) instead of being forced in making structural changes aimed at preventing us from getting into debt again . 
  besides , the euro makes our exports to the single market more competitive , for the first time since ww2 we had a trade balance surplus , and we did it without having to massively cut our living standards . 
   yeah we know you hate greeks and want their extermination little hitler . 
  i 'm not the one voting for extremists but whatever you say, 
   how 's the euro coming along ? 
  better than the usd , actually . 
   seriously though , would n't that mean that those who want to get into bed with each other as fast as possible ... never mind the consequences . 
  they can do it , then the others ( and it 's not just the uk , remember ) can sit on the outskirts and enjoy the mutual benefit . 
  yeah , i get you , it 's just that it would be best if we acted together and properly discussed eu policies instead of some wanting to change the system and others wanting to be exempted from such commitments . 
  if we were to be in this on our own , we would n't have joined this ever closer union in the first place , now would we ? 
   this would be fantastic , but i guarantee that my side of the english channel will annoy me and argue this is brussels trying to force british people to actually talk to all you europeans :( we 're already talking , 
   they are popularity polls . 
  they allow voting for more than one . 
  and so it seems the greeks went with everything on the left side of the spectre . 
  because what you need right now is more spending , right ? 
  damn , how could you ever fuck up that bad , i still do n't know . 
   what happened to that `` two speed europe '' idea ... ca n't we just do that ? 
  better yet , how about the uk leaves and does things on its own time ? 
  we can even make a race out of it !, 
  because honestly a `` two speed europe '' sounds unsustainable and considering the time you take to get used to change ( how 's the metric system coming along ? 
  ) , it might be best for us to just stop trying to cater to you and leave you be . 
   how does this math work ? 
  from what it seems , greeks favour socialism and are n't very good with numbers . 
  ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
   `` a brutal assault from ideologically-crazed demagogues '' the irony !, 
   the us would probably threaten to take diplomatic sanctions if we do that ... and we can threaten to raise tariffs on goods that are produced in their swing-states like we 've done in the past and they 'll change their tune about trying to interfere with our domestic policy . 
  i want the brits in so that it 's easier to improve the single market for the better . 
  if the uk leaves , we 'll be left with france and it will be harder for us all to deal with some nonsense like cap . 
   for every person who 's been robbed by a gypsy , there 's a gypsy who 's been beat up and discriminated against for a crime he did n't commit . 
  sorry , i just ca n't believe that , it 's not how they are , it 's not everybody else 's fault that they 're the only group who constantly alienates itself from the rest of society . 
  give me ** a single example ** of an upstanding gypsy and i 'll change my tune about how they 're nothing but problems . 
   it 's a vicious cycle , and someone needs to fucking break it before we europeans revert to our usual reflex of genocide . 
  no , what will continue to happen is them being around and be one of those nuisances which are more trouble than it 's worth it to fix it . 
  like dog turd on the side walk - it may ruin your day but it 's impossible to get rid of it . 
   i literally live next to gypsies . 
  i do n't hate them and i 've never had problems with my gypsy neighbors . 
  are you by any chance related to your neighbour ? 
   while i 'm surprised you do n't know rushdie i do now !, 
  x ) i had heard about him in the past but did n't know exactly what it was about and i did n't know his face , well , you learn something new everyday , 
   rather than their actual genetics commanding them to be criminals by some mystical intrinsic force . 
  what the fuck ? 
  genetics ? 
  simonask , for someone who 's so clearly concerned about discrimination , for you to even consider this , what is this world coming to ? 
   yet believe that they 're the product of some very unfortunate economic and social conditions it 's also not that , there are ( unfortunately ) plenty of people in much worse economic and social conditions who are able to live a life and they never end up like the gypsies . 
  you want to know the real culprit ? 
  it 's their damn education , it 's their damn culture , they 're raised to live away isolated from the rest of society and to sustain themselves through criminality , no wonder they 'll never fit in when they refuse and forbid others to leave their little tribe and to integrate into society by getting an education and applying for an actual job , that 's unthinkable to them , that 's not how they do things . 
  what will happen now ? 
   i used to dislike them but i learned a bit of their culture and have stolen my heart . 
   not `` paris '' . 
  but in the same way `` unova '' was clearly based in new york , and all previous regions match regions in japan . 
  they even have pok\u00e9-eiffel tower ( not official name , obviously ) damn , pok\u00e9mon has changed . 
  when i started playing , there was only kanto . 
  then came johto and some years latter hoenn . 
  and then i stopped playing pok\u00e9mon . 
  is it true that it 's no longer 386 but rather some 600 ? 
  in real life i apologize for a lot of things i do n't have to , too . 
  must have some canadian genes or something . 
  that 's discriminatory to the canadians . 
   xenophiles dont care about facts . 
  as any brainwashed [ religious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sn9qo.jpg ) person do . 
  who are the two guys in the bottom right ( fatwa and hate crime ) ? 
   what , gypsies ?!, 
    one person once robbed me , i bet it was a gypsy !, 
  only logical conclusion i can make : all gypsies are criminals !, 
    i mean , i 'm not racist , but i think we should get rid of gypsies . 
  oh , and muslims . 
  honest question : have you ever in your life actually met a gypsy ? 
  oh great , another thread that will be linked to srs . 
   in scandinavia , they 're around 40-50 % . 
  i think you 're confusing the average rate with the maximum rate . 
  and there is n't `` a tax '' , there 's plenty of different taxes and different rates . 
  if you do n't believe me , feel free to go on r/portugal and ask if taxes are , by any chance , low . 
  they are from the highest rates in europe and they 're also quite unwisely spent , this much you ca n't really debate . 
   the value of $ 5 today < the value $ 5 in two-three years time when you finally decide to spend the saved money . 
  while that is true because of inflation , it 's no reason to promote any such thing as devaluing our money at any high rate as too high inflation promotes frugal spend as opposed to saving and investing . 
  it 's essential for the well-being of society to keep it down , imagine if suddenly inflation rose to 25 % or 50 % , what would happen to your savings ? 
  imagine that you had worked your whole life for it and that was the money you were going to spend after retirement ? 
  on , and the 5 $ you have deposited on the bank wo n't be 5 $ in two or three years time , the bank does n't keep it in the vault waiting for you to pick it up , it loans it to others who invest this money and generate wealth from this . 
  money saved is n't money lost , you 'll have that money back in the future and will spend it then and in the mean time the bank will loan that money to someone , both you and the bank will also benefit from interest rates and the guy who invested the money will benefit from his investment which was only possible with the funding your money allowed . 
   first off , i am unfamiliar with / r/europe so i apologize if i am breaking any rules ( ** i did check up on them ** ) you 've done more than i ever did and i 've been here for ages xd  do most people in monaco live in the typical home one would find in the united states like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0cmsi.jpg ) ? 
  not even close . 
  take a look at monaco on [ google maps ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/3d7lu ) , that place is tiny , use street view if you want to see how the place actually is . 
  i can tell you right now it 's not like anything you 'll find in the us . 
  but then again , very few houses in europe are , we build our houses not out of wood but out of concrete :p  how does public housing work in monaco ? 
  i highly doubt it .
