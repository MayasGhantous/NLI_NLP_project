   what is the average amount of money that a person would expect to spend on a home in monaco ? 
  a whole fucking lot . 
  you better have made it in life to even consider living in monaco . 
  i was told a bottle of water there could get to 10 $ , how crazy is that ? 
   what i 'm suggesting is that if people do n't have money to spend it affects the entire economy . 
  you 're right , but to come to the conclusion that `` people do n't have money to spend so the state should spend for them '' is , to put it lightly , odd . 
  what the state needs to do in that situation is to liberalise the market , lower taxes and pursue other policies that allow the economy to grow with less restrictions . 
  not to get into debt , spend in name of the families and then get stuck paying interest till it can levy the taxes required to pay off the debt . 
   i find it hard to believe that there was ever an economy that boomed due to frugal spending . 
  well , [ it happened here ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  see our current debt level and compare it with how it was in the past . 
  as you can see , it can be more serious than one might think . 
  we have [ this socialist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_s%c3%b3crates ) to thank for this though . 
   the money i save is always the paycheck you do n't get , in spite of you being a hard worker . 
  the broken window fallacy is not always so fallacious . 
  what ? 
  are you suggesting that money saved is money that will never be spent ? 
  that even if you keep it in the bank the whole time and die without spending it , that nobody will benefit from it , that it will go with you to the grave ? 
   latvia is slowly getting out of the crisis ( via austerity ) yes . 
   and so is the us ( via stimulus ) are they ? 
  they 're constantly increasing their debt ceiling and are n't being able to cut their spending . 
  what they 've been doing is inflating away their problems by printing more and more dollars and delaying their payments . 
  that 's hardly sustainable , let 's hope they do n't crash and burn . 
  just think about this , even with everything that 's been going on here in the eu , the euro is stronger than the usd . 
   excessive reliance on government spending can hurt economies ( france ) yes . 
   or it can not ( sweden ) . 
  with regards to sweden , keep in mind they have a very liberalised market and keep their corporate tax rates are very low . 
  they were against the eu financial transaction tax . 
  not that i can criticise sweden 's tax laws , they might be from the highest but they get their money 's worth . 
  unfortunately the same ca n't be said here as we 've spend money on the most useless things . 
   i never said to spend out of control you clearly said you were against austerity and austerity means cutting excessive public spending . 
   i argued that there 's way too little taken in tax by the southern european countries . 
  too little tax ? 
  [ you have to be kidding me ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20875752 ) !, 
   ... and then you 're fired and a peon who does n't complain gets hired in your place , for less than what you make . 
  fired ? 
  not with our labour laws . 
  it would be easier to shut down the whole factory than it would be to fire a worker . 
   lower taxes ? 
  but in northern europe , taxes are much higher than in southern europe . 
  [ not in portugal , they 're not ] ( http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsol.sapo.pt%2finicio%2feconomia%2finterior.aspx%3fcontent_id%3d49910&amp;act=url ) !, 
   [ you guys ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nertfo-sk ) that video is quite old and though i find it amusing , it 's also not accurate . 
  keynes never was the `` let 's spend what we do n't have '' as many now would want you to believe , the spending he did support was for public goods that were greatly needed during the great depression , he did n't have that many disagreements with hayek when it came to fiscal policy . 
  with regards to hayek , to not even mention his views on monetary policy , yeah , way to over-examine the details and ignore the elephant in the room . 
   you also do n't seem to grasp de idea of a loan . 
  99.999 % of all business ventures ever were made with people spending money they did n't have . 
  we 're in debt because we loaned too much and the investments did n't pay off . 
  you 're suggesting we to get even more loans as opposed to reducing the overall spending of government ? 
   you should read [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-understands-debt.html?_r=0 ) we have a debt over 100 % of our gdp , and portugal is n't the usa , most of our debt is n't owed to ourselves , we do n't have our own monetary policy , and our economy growing ( unlike our debt ) . 
  this on its own is more than enough reason to not get into more debt , but even if this was n't true , why should we increase public spending ? 
  we have plenty of public goods - infrastructure , education , nhs , you name it !, 
  btw , for quoting krugman , you should read [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/14/opinion/reckonings-after-the-horror.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ) and then [ this ] ( http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#broken_window ) . 
   who gives a damn about a fucking flag oddly enough , some people do . 
  [ here 's a flag that tends to get some people upset ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3mvej.jpg ) . 
   no , we [ will be rich like this ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:banknoteyug.jpg ) 50 billion yugoslavian dinars ? 
  [ that 's lovely ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/zimbabwe_%24100_trillion_2009_obverse.jpg/640px-zimbabwe_%24100_trillion_2009_obverse.jpg ) . 
   why scandinavian countries are doing well despite their taxes being almost 50 % of the gdp ? 
  sweden debt to gdp in 2012 - [ 38.4 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/government-debt-to-gdp ) denmark debt to gdp in 2012 - [ 46.6 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/denmark/government-debt-to-gdp )  why portugal is doing quite badly while having its taxes at around 20 % of gdp ? 
  portugal debt to gdp in 2012 - [ 108.1 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp ) greece debt to gdp in 2012 - [ 170.6 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt-to-gdp )  i hear this neoliberal `` because southern european are lazy , while the northern europeans are hard-working '' who said that ? 
  i want to laugh at him as well xd more like because some countries let the free market work on its own and just tax what they need to make the state work as well ( like mostly everyone did ) and because some other countries tried to send what they did n't have and spent money without levying enough taxes to cover for it and now are n't being able to either cut the spending or raise the taxes required to face the debt problem and are facing these problems as a result ( like a few countries in south did ) . 
  that 's all there is to it , on the one hand you have balanced budgets and deficits under control and on the other you have unbalanced budgets and public debt getting out of control , the consequences of these two situations now having their consequences . 
   i 'm not saying that nordic people are not hard-working , just that they do n't work more than the southerners . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  who 's saying x or y are z or w ? 
  on , and with regard to hard work , what matters is productivity , not time on the job . 
   in nordic countries , you 're paid 8 hours , you work 8 hours . 
  but in some parts of southern europe , it 's expected for you to stay late at work , to do unpaid overtime . 
  yeah , i 'd suggest that people who work overtime and are n't paid to renegotiate their contracts . 
  it might not be the wisest time to do it now with the unemployment as it currently is but the unemployment is itself a consequence of the business conditions here which are driving away employment . 
  if we were to , among other things , lower taxes to levels comparable to those of northern europe ( that or properly spend the taxes we levy , though i fail to see what public goods and services we 're lacking ) , people here would have an higher income , business conditions would improve and employment would return . 
   if there is austerity people get fired from private companies no , they do n't . 
   if there is austerity the government no longer buys things and services from private companies . 
  which is a good thing , it stops public debt from growing and allows for a reduction in taxes . 
   people get fired from those private companies ( lack of demand for their products ) or they sell their product to someone else . 
  for example , [ this is what romania exports ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:romania_export_treemap.png ) . 
  you think it 's the government the ones who buy that shit ? 
  oh , and for the government to buy something , they need first to get the taxes for it . 
  they do n't actually produce anything , they only redistribute from the people who worked in the first place to the people who are now doing jobs for the state and that could be employed elsewhere had n't the state paid them to work for them . 
   for every euro that the state cuts in spending , another 5 $ ( it may be as low as 3 $ or as high as 7 $ , depending on the economy ) is lost from the gdp of the country . 
  jesus fuck , and for every 1 $ the state spends , another 5 $ or 3 $ or 7 $ is lost from the gdp of the country because that euro had to come from the taxpayers . 
  are you really this stupid ? 
  you think there are free lunches ? 
  that the state can just spend money it does n't have ? 
  that all spending is good , the state should just spend 1.000.000.000.000 $ and we 'd all be insanely rich just like that ? 
   and the problems is not just that decrease in gdp ( that is very obvious in greece ) or that private companies go bankrupt due to lack of ~ ~ demand ~ ~ ** purchasing power ** from customers . 
  it 's that it 's a vicious cycle : after a couple of years of ~ ~ austerity ~ ~ ** excessive taxes ** , the economic climate will become so bad that the government needs more ~ ~ austerity ~ ~ ** taxes ** , leading to an even worse economic climate . 
  there , ftfy . 
  hey sasp777 , your comments are funny , could you draw an hammer and sickle here as well or perhaps act like you do when you 're on r/debateacommunist ? 
  i always get a chuckle out of that . 
   unemployment at a new high ? 
  we need more austerity and cuts !, 
  you 're right , we need more debt and more public spending !, 
  the state should just give people stuff and everything should be free !, 
  hurr durr welfare please !, 
  if instead of putting on a show , they focused on finding or creating a job , maybe they would n't be unemployed by now . 
  what 's goatse , bro ? 
   a friend of mine had to do this and went to the metro station ; while we 're waiting for the train to arrive we ca n't say we 're late right ? 
  90 % of the people answered the poll ... yeah , i hate it when that happens , i usually make something up about having to meet with someone somewhere and get out of there . 
  sure , i could say `` no '' to the random stranger but that would feel rude and they 're not asking me just because , so yeah . .
