   i want to be able to tell my kid that they could grow up to be lord protector of the british isles . 
  why do wish harm to your kid ? 
   peter bofinger , economist at w\u00fcrzburg university and one of the german government 's economic advisers , believes that while reforms in southern european countries are inevitable , germany , europe 's most powerful economy , needs to do more to help . 
  in fact , ** it needs to make itself less competitive . 
  **  `` we need wage increases of five percent and more this year , '' he says . 
  `` we need higher pensions and higher welfare pay-outs . 
  only if germany gets more expensive , if it loses competitiveness relative to the other eurozone members , we can fix this fundamental flaw in the construction of the eurozone . '' please do n't listen to this fool . 
  what germany needs is to continue being very competitive . 
  what a ridiculous claim , that germany should act against its self-interest to reduce the divide . 
  if anything , germany should do what they can to bring the rest of europe to its level and countries like mine should do like germany did to become as competitive as ( or even more competitive than ) the germans !, 
   in portugal , homeland to eu commission president barroso , president anibal cavaco silva used his new year 's speech to condemn the bailout terms dictated by eu and international monetary fund ( imf ) as `` social injustice '' which led to a `` vicious circle of economic decline and a reduction of tax revenue . '' an\u00edbal cavaco silva is the president , not the pm , he has no power , let him talk as nobody takes him seriously any more . 
  he 's also from the same political party as our current pm and from barroso himself , so it 's not like he 'd act too much against their interest . 
  last but not least , he 's also to blame for our situation as he was pm from 85 till 95 and even with the accession of portugal to the eu and all the money that started pouring in from brussels , the debt to gdp ratio increased during his years . 
   but the real worry , according to german economist lars feld of freiburg university , is france . 
   `` they have n't done anything to increase their competitiveness , '' says mr. feld , `` yet is the country that works the least among eurozone members each year . ''  german officials in the past few months did not hide their disappointment in what they perceive as an ineffective response to the crisis by president hollande . 
  with negative growth predicted for most of europe in 2013 , it would be a major blow if the eurozone 's second economy were to stumble . 
  this . 
  i would n't worry too much about portugal and spain and the like as we 're on the right path and the only way we can go is up , the reforms are taking place and once the debt goes down and there 's a relief in taxes , the economy will be able to grow again . 
  france , on the other hand , they 're a serious issue , sarkozy must have fucked up pretty bad for hollande getting into power , do n't let them fuck things up for the rest of europe !, 
  gosh , can you imagine the smugness of the brits if the french fucked things up for us all ? 
  i 'd rather have the eu renamed uke and brussels moved to westminster than having the eu fail and it being fault of the french gauche and l'internationale , the germans who could n't stand up to them and the brits who went `` fuck this , we 're safe on our island '' !, 
   being dutch i guess i 'm supposed to be an `` asker '' but what you do , the `` feeling around a bit '' and even the beating around the bush , seems somewhat natural with regards to sensitive issues . 
  nah , we take it to an extreme , if we get pushed to the spot we 'll often do n't reject it and then do something against our own will like for example `` hold on to this '' , `` mate , i have to do this and that '' , `` it 's just a second '' , `` oh ... '' and then we 're left hanging with that thing and every second we 're there waiting for the other person we 're thinking `` fuck , i 've got places to go , damn it !! '', 
  even when we could have said `` no '' and be out of there . 
  and now we 're making broad generalisation about which nationality is the most racist . 
  you know whom i blame ? 
   actually not . 
  my friend is a manager in big it-service company , they have policy , if you do n't ask it , you do n't get it . 
  this means that pay levels can vary hugely , some get somewhere around 3000 from work that others get 4000 . 
  if you do n't ask , you do n't get it . 
  the only way you will get a rise is if management things that you are going to leave and they wo n't want you to leave , then you will get a raise . 
  that is n't that big of a deal if one can bluff . 
  though i do see it becoming an issue , as you 'd have to get the other person in the spot . 
   lol i wanted to ask whether you 're new to reddit but obviously you 're not ... have you been living under a rock ? 
  back in the days , i did found it interesting , i did went there to discuss issues and learn from them . 
  but then it got very annoying and thankfully i already had an account and therefore unsubscribed :p, 
   do you hate disappointing people that much ? 
  i 'll speak for myself even though pretty much everybody is like this : i guess i do . 
  i mean , it 's like a safeguard , so that i can always go back on my answer/question and to never push the other person into an uncomfortable situation . 
  but yes , if you ask me something to which i want to say no , i 'll go with `` perhaps '' , i 'll dodge the issue , i 'll delay it to an uncertain future , i 'll say `` that could be interesting if x and y also happened '' - i may say a lot but i wo n't say `` no '' . 
  for example , arranging a date can be quite an hassle , i do n't want to push the other person into saying `` no '' or going with me against her own will , and i also do n't want to face rejection - i first have to ask if we she 's free next week , then i tell her that i was planning on doing something , then i ask her if she 'd be interested in joining me and this takes a while , if on any of these steps she does n't seem convinced then i immediately fall back and suggest if something else would sound better and this goes on and on till a consensus is achieved even though during the whole time i did n't ask her out and she did n't say no , all the questions were around the issue but nothing like `` want to go out with me ? '', 
  and all her answers were open to interpretation and never `` yes , i want to go out with you '' or `` no '' . 
  yeah , i 'll say that here you have to read into the words and do the best to not push people into yes/no questions as we 'll do our best to avoid saying a no . 
   just go visit / r/atheism , they have lots of examples of fanatic abuse due to all sorts of religious beliefs . 
  i went there to learn more about atheism and religion in general but i did n't need to as  [ in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  not because of some phony god 's blessing . 
  but because , i am enlightened by my own intelligence .

   more like hey corrupt greek politcian # 24324 want to sign your name on this 5 billion $ contract your country can not afford . 
    you will get 100 million $ in bonus fees and it will be impossible to get in trouble for it since we will never reveal your name . 
    what do you say ? 
  i say that the greeks really need to improve their justice system and demand transparency from their government . 
   sure is . 
  that 's why it 's so much fun to hear such enthusiastic talk about how foreign people are a danger to the wonderful society of europe . 
  i do n't understand , why are you being that sarcastic ? 
  nobody hates anyone unless that other person is committed in being a problem . 
  i 'll speak for myself , i 'm slightly concerned about these cases becoming more and more frequent in europe but i certainly do n't hate anyone because of their background . 
  some people might be idiots , sure , but there are idiots everywhere in live . 
  as long as they do n't get organised , they 're not that big of a deal . 
   portuguese ** hate ** saying ** no ** no . 
  xd ok , maybe you 're right . 
  the closest i come to saying `` no '' is `` not now , i 'm in a hurry to do whatever , maybe later '' even when it 's something i 'd hate to do like for example answering some stupid survey or helping someone i 'm not friends with . 
   british propagandists , as always . 
    hand in hand with russians hating the euro . 
  r/conspiracy is that way = = , 
   politics so are you telling me it went something like this ? 
   `` hey greece , do you want to buy these submarines ? '', 
    `` hell yeah , germany !, 
  where do i sign ? '', 
    `` right here . '', 
    `` thanks ! ... 
  hey , wait a second ... 
  germany !!!! '',

   as an ethnic minority ex-muslim the conversations in this thread as so heart warming , makes me feel so welcome . 
  freakzilla , are you an ex-muslim ? 
  is n't that a sin punishable by death ? 
   religion ... not even once religion ? 
  all religion ? 
  then why is that only muslims make it a regular occurrence of engaging in this type of fanaticism ? 
  why do n't we ever hear about christians beating their children to death because they did n't want to learn the bible or jews violently smacking their kids for not reading the torah or hindus being violent because of whatever in their religion is about but yet , when it comes to muslims , why is that every week another one of them beats up or kills someone else because of their faith ? 
  i 'd appreciate it if people actually told me why is there such a difference , because it seems to me that while all religion is stupid , only one is this violent . 
   til / r/europe is a racist shithole . 
  much like real life europe i presume . 
  if you do n't like it you can go back to r/srs, 
   when you can negotiate a salary over  $ 5k , you have enough bargaining power to negotiate the vacation days you want . 
  it was just an example . 
  it works the same for any level of income . 
   the woman at the supermarket register is n't in such a good position , though . 
  yes but the principle still stands . 
  for their employers to give them more vacation days they 'll wave to cut back on their wages or raise the prices for the final consumer . 
  regardless of the outcome , the economy loses competitiveness and there 's no net benefit for society . 
   society as a whole benefits because this way , families can spend time together with their kids at the cost of a lower income at the end of the year . 
  if people ( with lower qualifications or not ) want to spend more time on holidays and not working , they 're always free to do such , they only need to reach an agreement together with their union and their employer . 
  forcing everybody to have a certain number of days on vacation when even themselves might favour the alternative of working is highly inefficient and contrary to the principles of contractual freedom . 
   have time to consume ( shopping , movies , restaurants ) people always have time to consume . 
   because it lowers health care cost how so , if the healthcare is the same ? 
   because more people are needed to fill the jobs . 
  that 's dumb , it would be like saying `` it takes 8 hours for 1 gardener to clean a park , but instead of hiring 1 gardener for 8 hours or instead of employing 8 gardeners each for 1 hour , we 'll employ 96 gardeners each for 5 minutes - society will benefit because more people will work '' .
