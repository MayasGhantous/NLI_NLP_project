  in lisbon we never noticed much difference with the new tolls because we never had any scuts or free anything apart from that radius . 
  crel having tolls pissed me off , porto or the algarve you could use 50km of highway for free , in lisbon we had 10 kms in each direction and that was it and no free bridges . 
  crel has always always been extortionate . 
  vci tolls on that would be too insane though . 
  i think it is forbidden by eu regulations , for a certain radius and for capitals i think ( or cities past a certain size ) . 
  i can not find the specific piece of regulation so not much help ( nor do i know why bridge tolls and congestion fees are admissible ) but the tolls of a1 used to be right at sacav\u00e9m and had to change to alverca because of that . 
  other highways are newer , but if you notice the `` paid '' part of a5 and a2 only starts at a certain distance from lisbon . cril is also free . 
  you did not think this was all due to the own iniciative of a , any , portuguese government , now did you ? 
  and that they had been ignoring that `` possible '' source of revenue all this time ? 
  nope . 
  i thought this was really interesting . 
  i had no idea what was underneath all this . 
  a well deserved bad reputation imo . 
  we got some autoestradas which we do not need and we do not have a few which we needed more . 
  but at least we awoke to the crisis before spending ( much ) money on the tgv at poceir\u00e3o ( poceir\u00e3o-porto 40 minutes faster than oriente-campanha , uh ? ), 
  or aiport at ota . 
  yes , it was very high . 
  but it was not 30 % . 
   what i can find is census information , from years ending in 1 ,  http://www.pordata.pt/portugal/taxa+de+analfabetismo+segundo+os+censos+total+e+por+sexo-2517  so 18.6 in 1981 , and 11.0 in 1991 . so maybe 15-16 in 1986 ? 
  that is not one third . 
  sort of , but not all the reason . 
  do you , on that pordata link noticed the difference between male and female iliteracy ? 
  girls of the more deprived classes were just not sent to school , particularly if they were the eldest child or girl . 
  pretty shocking still to meet ladies , personable and competent looking ladies of 60 or 70 who say `` sabe n\u00e3o sei ler , o que diz aqui ? 
   people tend to forget that portugal had over 30 % of illiteracy when joining the eu i am like the other guy , what ?

  i am not wrong . 
  and am sort of pissed off at downvotes to me and upvotes to you because it is adding insult to the injury of the frustration of regularly driving on those red roads . 
  red roads are not proper highways . 
  nor anything close . 
  in some places ( often near big towns and their industrial centers ) you got stretches of 5-10 kms which they look like proper highways , on others they can look like estradas municipais . 
  in alentejo particularly , the a26 just does not exist . 
  there is a bit just before arriving in sines and that is it . 
  the rest is ip8 , try here , just outside santigo do cac\u00e9m for example http://goo.gl/maps/x2un3 autoestrada between sines and near beja , ah , lol , good one , look around . 
  if you find it , i would love to use it . 
  ip2 is a north-south road shown red on the map between nisa - portalegre-extremoz - look at it for example http://goo.gl/maps/bcd2h ( use streetview ) or here near portel http://goo.gl/maps/y6qfk or near portalegre http://goo.gl/maps/03tul so far all these links are the first random links i picked ( apart from a bit just off sines ) . 
  to the north now - a 24 which is more commonly known by ip3 here a bit south of viseu http://goo.gl/maps/g0bw2 or to tras os montes , a4 ( that is ip4 ) near macedo de cavaleiros , shown on red continuing to spain past macedo de cavaleiros http://goo.gl/maps/knhfh or ip2 as well http://goo.gl/maps/2sbvz edit - hope linkage is working on it . 
  streetview for everything to see what i mean , please . 
  no they are not . 
  some , i think ones marked in red are something called itiner\u00e1rio principal meaning they are ( non paid ) bits of regular road going through towns and all which get every few km turned into 3 lanes , third lane being for overtaking in one direction . 
  hate them but better than nothing, 
  i put those into maps rather than satellite pics , to get a clearer view . 
  will give you about a32 which does not seem to make much sense . 
  ( and i think a10/a13 is unnecessarty particularly with the two bridges and the downstream bridge was expensive . ), 
  the rest dunno , how arguable it all is . 
  particularly around porto and surroundings , and i don \u00b4 t know how essential any of those are - i think alfacinhas would probably be jealous of those , they could use a third bridge . 
   anyway , the results are coming in and portugal has experienced many more deaths on the road this year . 
  just a few more casualties of this crisis . 
  nitpicking , but we don \u00b4 t know that yet . 
  it might * not * , just because there is less traffic of all kinds . 
  apparently in 2012 , where the tolls were already in place , traffic mortality decreased 15.8 % . 
  the accidents at ourique were very shocking and sad ( bloody august ) and make us think things are getting worse , but in that case a2 was the only alternative in that case and a2 was always always paid and always expensive . 
  otoh there is another factor nobody is talking about , but which i think matters - with the crisis cars are ageing and getting replaced less often . 
  older cars are inherently less safe , not just due to more chances of a mechanical failure , but because they got less safety built into their structure . 
  that little red car at ourique , maybe a new car would have kept some of the inhabitants alive . 
  and some data i think interesting , if you want to see https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=e8cmo79ldj412_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=kil_mio_pop&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;idim=country:pt&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=683247600000&amp;tend=1219791600000&amp;ind=false portuguese road mortality compared to eu average between 1991 and 2008 - i think the decreasing trend has been maintained since 2009 and 2012 . 
  to nitcpick , i think there no 3 parallel highways anywhere . 
  two maybe on a few places . 
  though i think almost none is too scandalous a decision : here is the map http://destaquesdodia.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/auto-estradas-portugal.pdf on red the roads which had less traffic way back in 2009 ( it was what i could find , i guess the less used roads continue to be the less used and the most used still the most used ) , there are cril/crel in lisbon and those are normalish radial highways , and both important to go around lisbon - marked in blue in the map so relatively high traffic . 
  cril being free is definitely very high traffic always . 
  a6 is marked as low traffic but is essential because it is the best route to spain and the rest of europe ( a25 is/was notoriously dangerous ) . 
  the a7 is important as well , for tras os montes to have acess to the coast ( where cities , main hospitals , airports , ports are ) . 
  the northern highways look all close together , but terrain is mountainous and normal roads full of little villages , so sort of understandable . 
  the a17 imo sort of makes sense because it helps to create an alternative to the very old very crowded a1 on a heavy traffic area . 
  a14/a15 dunno how stupid they are - some i think . 
  a10/a13 is imo actually a stupid highway in my opinion , the lowest traffic of all portuguese highways and we would have been better served if it had been a highway connecting a2 to sines . 
  that one is indeed a dud , though i guess the reasoning for it was to create a north-south alternative which did not get too close to lisbon ( and its traffic ) . 
  you are probably right . 
  the market i know best is the portuguese one and right now there might be a need for more business pcs due to new laws regarding invoicing and shipping certificates . 
  i will be very curious to see how portugal \u00b4 s numbers will compare to the rest of europe \u00b4 s. 
  i was curious and went checking and apparently it \u00b4 s not a europe exclusive problem http://channelnomics.com/2013/08/22/pc-market-deteriorating-fast-says-staples/  `` staples has warned that the pc market is `` deteriorating fast '' as it posted weaker-than-expected results and slashed its profit forecasts . 
  the office supplies giant saw its shares freefall by 15 per cent yesterday as it logged a two per cent drop in q2 sales . 
  ( ... ) the results underline long-held concerns that windows 8 is failing to bolster a pc market battered by muted consumer spending and the shift to tablets '', 
  not on the business market which is a big , maybe the majority part of the pc market . 
  and windows 8 really has some problems for business usage , or so i am told . 
  windows 8 would be my guess . 
  yep . 
  going even more analytic , the brand is esprit , which is french for spirit so 1968 spirit by the guy which is removing spontaneous art ( it is , in my opinion ) slash vandalism done to apologize during the anniversary of the violent repression of the prague spring . 
  poster above says after all it is a coincidence , so it looks like the universe is just trolling us by now . 
  the universe is trolling , 
  yeah and i am impressed the worker was able to find a commercial one , that can \u00b4 t have been easy . 
  intentional t-shirt of course ? 
  http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=spain&amp;country2=united+kingdom&amp;displaycurrency=gbp that is sort of lifted off numbeo , with some values a bit different - exchange rates or a bit out of date maybe . 
  so you can compare two cities from a given set , it \u00b4 s interesting . 
  not perfect data but pretty good at giving an idea for most places i have been to . 
  there was another one about a year before that one , in the morning , about 10 am . 
  both a little bit scary particularly the second which woke me up . 
  i hate waking up with earthquakes . 
  and that the first one was soooo long , much longer than usual i was thinking oh , fuck i should have moved already this is getting stronger . 
  thankfully no . 
  i think the second one made that a lot of things had to be inspected , i remember some cliffs were supposedly unstable . 
   perhaps . 
  on the other hand they have a wider base to compare themselves generally to . 
  ask a frenchman to compare french culture to `` other '' cultures and algerian muslim will sneak in quickly . 
  same with pakistanis/indians in the uk and turks in germany . 
  ask the question in finland and people will think of sweden and russia as `` immediate vicinity '' . 
  isn \u00b4 t that counterlogical ? 
  it is precisely the french and british who do not seem to think themselves particularly superior to others , even if they have the wider base of comparison by your argument with much different ( and poorer ) countries . 
  germany for example , seems to think itself superior in a noticeably higher margin .
