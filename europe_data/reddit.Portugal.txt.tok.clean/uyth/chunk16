   countries like france or portugal did n't feel very threatened , by russia ? 
  not particularly . 
  but we sold less pears and other stuff over it . 
  france didn \u00b4 t sell two ships . 
  i don \u00b4 t mind it , particularly when they got , like in la defense , a particular skyline and are in a particular place . 
  now tour de montparnasse , i do not like at all . 
  in istanbul there is something similar , a skyscraper area - if i understand correctly from the photos these are not in that area , but strays closer to the old parts , which already have an unbelievable very old skyline . 
  that is actually maybe not a bad idea . 
  istanbul has to have one of the most beautiful skylines , variety in possible points of views in the world . 
  one of the most beautiful cities in the world also . 
  but the article is from a year ago , right ? 
  how did it go since then ? 
  good semantics point , but is just semantics , the article seems to assume ps can still get a majority even with less votes plus , nevermind this makes no sense at all  back in 2011 , it was hard to imagine that ps would manage to walk away from the crisis largely unscathed . 
   in portugal , though , the socialists were back in the lead in opinion polls after just one year in opposition and went on to win the local and european elections -- in a ironic twist to the history of the euro crisis . 
  is this surprising ? 
  did anybody expect an austerity government to remain popular ? 
  did anybody actually expect it to even last 4 years ? 
  ( i didn \u00b4 t ) . 
  the shocking thing would be if an austerity government managed to get reelected . 
   pedro magalh\u00e3es , a researcher at the institute of social sciences in lisbon , argues that one of the reasons for the turnaround was the election of a party leader who was seen as one of the major ` inner critics ' of the former government seguro ? 
  lol . 
  i don \u00b4 t understand the sentence exactly . 
  is the author portuguese ? 
  it \u00b4 s really well written but kind of tangential in points and details . 
  so nevermind science and measurements . 
  people should know just by looking ? 
  the last pic on the first link surprised me maybe but there is a definition of what is overweight and we should stick to it since that is what the report discussed used . 
  plus no matter what you think is natural or average there are statistical risks and physics is not forgiving . 
  btw if 60 % of people are overweight or obese do we even know anymore just by looking what is the `` normal '' or is there a new normal ? 
  i notice that a lot with children sadly . 
  i think the concept of healthy weight is ridiculous . 
  weight is no guarantee of health . 
  some weights on both extremes will be guarantees of health problems . 
  maybe we need a new word for that bmi interval . 
  assuming the photos were given with the right data no , they are not , not medically . 
  and seriously , even the 31.3 bmi ones ? 
  that is my point , people think overweight is normal , average or `` healthy '' , so they get shocked if they hear 60 % of people are overweight and obese . 
  and if bmi is a bad instrument for measuring individual health , its failings are most at the extreme heights and by giving false negatives , by not spotting skinny fat . 
  this is overweight , if weight height are given correctly http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/506-160.html that is a bmi of 25.8 , being over 25 that is overweight . 
  http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/511-180.html bmi 25.1 http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/510-180.html 26.6 this is obese , a bmi of 31.3  30 http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/507-200.html i think we are so used to seeing so many people overweight or borderline obese we tend to consider it normal . 
   even if the socialists come second , they will elect more mps than any other party . 
  what ? 
  does anybody have any reputable source for that ? 
  i thought , from political analysts way back that it is precisely the opposite , that it is psd+cds , due to demographics which can get more deputados with less votes . 
  relevant , the only poll recently which bothered to try to figure out the deputados elected also got that scenario http://observador.pt/2015/09/18/sondagem-ps-esta-frente-votos-menos-deputados-agora/ and it \u00b4 s going to be extremely interesting and unpredictable - the polls are becoming less and less reliable ( as in the rest of the western world ) and then the electoral circles , can throw surprises . 
  and antonio costa , i don \u00b4 t know , the polls are unreliable but the trends are interesting . 
   lowest among ** western european ** countries . 
   above the average of 80.3 years for women and 73.1 years for men among the ** 52 countries included in who 's european region ** . 
  european region = western europe + the rest . 
  western europe \u00b4 s life expectancies are apparently on average quite higher than the rest of europe \u00b4 s and as such higher than the average for all of europe . 
  even the lowest western european life expectancy ( denmark for women or finland/portugal for men ) is higher than average if you average for all of europe . 
  i think it \u00b4 s the newspaper defining western europe though , it \u00b4 s not in the report . 
  military dictatorships like war toys ? 
  keeps some of their branches happy ? 
  you are not the only one , actually it \u00b4 s like every foreigner thinks the same . 
  which is why the `` drug '' selling scammers in lisbon \u00b4 s baixa have a target , because tourists will believe they are actually being offered drugs for sales , in daylight , right in the middle of rua augusta , under the nose of the police . 
  stupidity tax . 
  i am going to try to explain . 
  and i bet will get some downvotes from non portuguese because i am contradicting what they have heard . 
  all drugs are still ilegal . 
  the portuguese drug law is not a pro the right of people to consume drugs , it \u00b4 s a pragmatic law to deal medically with drug addiction . 
  actually drugs are perhaps a lot less cool , more stigmatized than in many other western nations . 
  the most recent version of the law is this one http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=181&amp;tabela=leis&amp;so_miolo= article 21 enumerates everything which is forbidden , sell , put to sale , import , grow , buy , give , etc jail sentence 5 to 15 years , or if the ammounts are small as determined in some table , it can be reduced 2 to 5 or up to 2 years possibily reduced to a fine , depending on what the judge decides . 
  the only thing it does not include is consumption , which is adressed on other articles , and basically there are a set of procedures for consumers to be evaluated or to receive medical treatment whether or not they quit . 
  carrot and stick procedure , follow the doctor appointments or risk being fined , or losing social benefits , or even real prison depending on ammounts and history . 
  it seriously works for us , it \u00b4 s very very different than what it was 15 years ago . 
  linking the law text i noticed something i did not know , it \u00b4 s now apparently a crime to abandon needles used for drug consumption . 
  selling drugs is ilegal . 
  buying drugs is ilegal . 
  intention to knowingly commit a crime counts as well , though with lesser penalties , even if you do not through with it because of external consequences . 
  `` drugs '' which are not drugs seems to be a catch-22 . 
  the seller might be committing a fraud , but does not intend to commit a drug crime . 
  it is the buyer who intends to commit a crime . 
  so extremely hard to control . 
  untill , like i said , law is revised to cover this , and i presume all the sellers will likely go to court , not necessarily be sentended to jail time but if convicted it might be enough for them to be expelled from the country and forbidden to return . 
  almofada is both . 
  travesseiro is a different special kind of pillow which in english is called bolster . 
  but the most common usage for travesseiro on everyday language is that it is what pastries , pillow shaped pastries are called . 
  though there are a few different version of travesseiros - sintra , tentugal , ordinary pastelaria stuff , kind of a generic name . 
   galician and portuguese are diferent languages whereas valcencian is a dialect of catalan . 
  every single reputable linguist on the world agrees on this . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  both those affirmations . 
  there is the old joke , the difference between a language and a dialect is an army and a navy . 
  i think it \u00b4 s up to galician speakers to consider if their language is a separate language or another version of the portuguese . 
  i am not fussed either way - but as a native portuguese speakers i think there is not much , any difference between what is spoken by the elderly 10 , 50 km south or north of the minho . 
   catalan has 11,5 m speakers . 
  portuguese in europe is around 10,8 m ( hard to get a figure but it 's more or less that ) i will repeat , source for all of that ? 
  and definitions ? 
  are you considering native speakers only or speakers who picked it as a secondary language ? 
  population of catalonia is obviously not all catalan speaking . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_language ethnologue which is an extremely reputable , if very fussy source , http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cat gives catalan 3,750,000 in spain ( european commission 2012 ) . 
  population total all countries : 4,079,420 . 
  l2 users : 5,150,000 in spain ( european commission 2012 ) . 
  it gives portuguese http://www.ethnologue.com/language/por 10,000,000 in portugal 750,000 in france and going to individual country pages 78,000 germany 17,000 uk 65,000 luxembourg etc etc. . . 
  these seem even low estimates because of you go by official numbers of portuguese/brazillian/capeverdean / angolan expatriates in other eu countries , you will get a lot lot more . 
  so between 10 -12 million speakers in europe versus 4-5 seriously ? 
   so yeah , they 're close , but we have more speakers bullshit . 
  it is not by being repeated it becames true . 
  i do not know if you have the word in catalan or spanish , fanfarronice , posturing .
