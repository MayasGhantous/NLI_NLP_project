  if you ever want to know what the eu has done for you , that is an example . 
  i don \u00b4 t think it would work . 
  scandinavia has extremely expensive alcohol and restrictions and they certainly have the same type of problems or worse than scotland . 
  it was to balance the other one . 
  and actually i am from , and live in , neither , 
  north : where `` caralho '' is a comma . 
  loud , lots of bad language used casually , proud and competitive , particularly with their neighbours . 
  like showing off . 
  ostensibly more religious , and close minded at that ( `` we don \u00b4 t want this priest , long hair and beard ! '' ) . 
  claim to be harder working than others . 
  eat corn bread . 
  south : very calm , very non-judgmental , traditionally left-wing , humble and non materialistic , traditionally a-religious except maybe when related to charities and things like the local santa casa . 
  traditional jokes about slow and laziness , but often reversed to turn the joke on the other character . 
  can survive forever and ever and ever on a diet of bread ( with garlic , coentros , olive oil ) . 
  eat wheat bread . 
   a\u00e7ores : they speak arabic . 
  we mainlanders ca n't understand a word they say . 
  and it \u00b4 s not arabic , it \u00b4 s flemish or something . 
  these numbers , numbeo , they are based on self-reported questions . 
  you can ( and should . 
  do not fill the questions you do not know , though ) their questioning . 
  it \u00b4 s about safety perceptions , you answer questions `` do you worry about your car getting stolen '' , `` do you worry about insulted about your race/religion / '' `` do you feel safe walking alone during the day / at night '' . 
  their numeric data regarding cost of living or property prices tends to be spot on , on the places i know best , so i tend to trust them . 
  the safety numbers also seem pretty correct on things like safety walking alone during the day/night for where i live . 
  but it is * perception * . 
  i think portuguese being naturally pessimists overwhelming say crime is worsening in the past 3 years which imo is clearly untrue . 
  iceland does not rank right at the top , which surprises me - maybe malta is competition but all those other countries i do not beliebe they are actually really safer than iceland ( i expect iceland to be like the azores actually . 
  stuff might happen , but come on guys ... ), 
  this is self-reported data , and prices of things in restaurants enter to the calculation heavily . 
  greece had , not sure if still has , much higher minimum wage than portugal and even spain , that had to have raised the prices for those items http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00155&amp;plugin=1 ( it \u00b4 s lower now than in spain , which is actually quite sad , but i suspect the higher prices are a leftover from that and that salaries are still high ), 
  tea cames from china , and was introduced in india in the 19th century by the british . 
  to whom the portuguese had introduced tea back in the 17th century . 
  ch\u00e1 is the chinese , mandarim word , we got it directly from china . 
  i expect russians also got the word directly from china but via the land route , not the sea route . 
   that are as large as the difference between a finnish university and a portuguese university . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  also crime index http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015-mid&amp;region=150 property price http://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015-mid&amp;region=150 cost of living http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015-mid&amp;region=150, 
  self-reported attention . 
  and when you change from continent europe to global , the color scale changes , which is sad ( for most of the rest of the world ) but interesting . 
  oh is that bait i smell ? 
  revealing personal details online to win points on an internet discussion with a russian troll now that is a good idea . 
  a troll who is at keyboard and conscious way late on a sunday night ? 
  hope you are being paid by the post . 
  glad to have been of help . 
  not vodka time yet comrade ? 
  they work you hard at the troll farm !, 
  good point . 
  i am sure it will show up on some pay site soon . 
  true . 
  maybe it is not the full photoshoot , we don \u00b4 t know what they filmed after the tea break . 
  i am happy to be part of the world where 4 year olds do not have to worry about attracting mates ( 4 year old ?! ) . 
  for adult women , they do not have to worry about competing with vodka if they want the attention of a particular men  but true , it \u00b4 s like in some countries , in some social classes and a mix of the two , poor women see their personal attractiveness as the most important thing for their future success . 
  in other places where there are more options , you see that attitude as gold-digging , social climbing , lazy , dodgy . 
  my theory is somebody is massively , historically record setting , on denial and as part of his denial process he is oppressing all others who dare to not be on denial . 
  those photos ... 
  being concerned about a girl , a child not getting a husband ? 
  the competitive beauty stuff ? 
  is this a true photo ? 
   `` i dress my daughter in a pretty dress and make her comb her hair , '' `` they look at me like i 'm from a third world country . 
  ** in my country if you do n't take care of yourself you do n't get a husband . 
  '' ** wonder where they might have gotten the third world idea from :\\ a lot of these cases i really really wonder what would be the other version , of the children \u00b4 s services . 
  and i hope she was not putting her child in pretty dresses unfit for weather or school activities . 
  you should not stop doing anything ( nor should you do anything ) worthwhile because of what people think , particularly faceless internet warriors on reddit . 
  if you do not have a problem with religion ( and you say you have contacted caritas ) talk with the jesuit refugee service http://en.jrs.net/ they have an office in portugal , actually they do a lot with refugees in portugal ( though of course , not a lot of refugees all around in portugal ) so they might want your help or know who might want it . 
  wtf ? 
  that was not there last time i was there !, 
  or i was very lucky with my angles . 
  that hurt , such a beautiful , nice city . 
  ( we got our own monstrosities , truth be told . 
  rias baixas and alto minho are kind of a continuum in almost everything ), 
  you claim to be portuguese - yes , it is perfectly reasonable to correct your attempts at it , since it evidently ( further ! ), 
  proves you do not have a clue about portugal and are not actually portuguese , except possibly on paper . 
  and my device can not fail on autocorrect as well , particularly when it tries to correct one language to a different one ? 
  only you have that excuse ? 
  i think this discussion has been all along about double standards . 
  also , your identification with portugal as `` us '' / `` ours '' particularly when you violently reject it at the same time and do not seem to now much about it ( government foreclosing on people ? 
  might be something you want to reconsider . 
  i don \u00b4 t get it why identify with a country you claim to hate and are not in , and which i bet does not really interfere in your life . 
  just for curiosity , north america right ? 
   without it turning into a contest to see who can piss the farthest !, 
  i wonder who started that , by attacking my english for example . 
   you had english classes . 
  i ** thought ** myself portuguese . 
  it makes sense . 
  unlike your arguments/worldview . 
   let me know if you need help with portuguese or english . 
  my english is far far better than your portuguese . 
   unlike you i did n't have the luxury of going to school there . 
  and if you had had would you have been bragging of your english while attacking mine ? 
  if you are a portuguese citizen , just move back , and apply to the same perks as refugees might get , rsi . 
  see how you like it . 
  free country . 
   i 'd be more then happy to help you with your english . 
  the person who above called my portuguese education a luxury ? 
   i 'd love to see the state of portugal without remittances from abroad !, 
  about the same if any ? 
  give these people a medal !, 
  comendadores , at least !, 
  maybe a street name after every one . 
  they bravely moved to a foreign country to make more money than they could back home , and they want to be appreciated for it , admired , respected , envied , all at the same time wanting their wishes to not have other people moving into the country they have left , because they might be economic migrants .
