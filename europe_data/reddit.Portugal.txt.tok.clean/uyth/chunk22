  vodka , is it supposed to taste like anything ? 
   what is normal where you live ? 
  very normal . 
  particularly wine . 
  i actually think our wine consumption is underestimated because they are not counting , can not count all the small landholders with vineyards making their own wine . 
  as vindimas is a really important social thing in portugal even for city dwellers , if you know somebody with small farm in the country , chances are they have vines and they invite all their friends for the vindimas . 
  some will pick the grapes , or only tokenly , likely some of the more built guys will help with the moving and pressing , but usually there is a snack a meal , children , stuff . 
  the only problem you can not know too much in advance when the vindimas are going to be , depends on the weather , so the social life of a lot of portuguese on the upcoming weekends is going to have to be planned on short notice !, 
  i really love it . 
   how old do you have to be to drink alcohol ? 
  law changed july 1st , i actually don \u00b4 t know . 
  you must be 18 to buy , but drinking below age is not a crime . 
  very few will care if somebody below 18 drinks a little , particularly if at a meal . 
   what do you tend to drink ? 
  mostly wine . 
  beer important as well . 
  edit to add the who data , from 2010 , via the wikipedia 55.5 % of all alcohol liters ( not the alcoholic beverage , the alcohol ) from wine , 30.8 % from beer , 10.9 % from spirits , 2.8 % from other ( what ? 
   when do you drink ? 
  wine at meals , but almost never outside meals . 
  beer at meals or outside meals - with a snack , watching a football game something like that . 
  spirits , rarely , mostly either traditional liqueurs and schnapps , or commercial spirits in cocktails ( gin tonic the big fashion right now ) . 
  you are like the anti-us . 
  the people who drink drink whenever they feel like , mostly wine at meals , or a beer after work or watching a football game . 
  but getting really drunk , the first time it \u00b4 s poor guy , miscalculated , the next times , everybody will think you are an alcoholic or has alcohol problems ( unless you are a university student ), 
  that game against holland in 2006 , yes , ** that ** one , the referee was russian . 
  we has beat them 7-1 a year or so ago though . 
  europe as a shield . 
  the whole 1383-1385 dynastic crisis up to aljubarrota battle . 
  a arraia miuda picking their king . 
  we had been a country for 250 years before that but that was its more complete affirmation . 
  it led to great things . 
  here as well , not just tourists ( and the problems elsewhere are a factor as well . 
  i mean thailand , turkey , even greece just this week ) but exports . 
  holiday in the eurozone instead . 
  ( which is kind of the point ), 
  you picked just north of segunda circular !, 
  that subway station is campo grande ffs , two subway stops away from metro lumiar , you got quinta das conchas on the middle . 
  that is cheating to win a petty argument . 
  you live there i presume , trying to sell or rent a house ? 
  it is a nice area , it \u00b4 s just it is not really central . 
  if i put from metro lumiar to metro rossio i get 12.9 km and 21 minutes by car , or 7.3 km and 1h30m on foot but you know about directional streets , you can \u00b4 t do that by car . 
  without traffic it might be 15 to 20 minutes - check google maps , though it might depend on your definition of centre ( rossio ? ) . 
  if and when there is no traffic , and of course if you can park for free or you are going to pay a fortune . 
  but most of the time there is going to be traffic , or parking is paid or non existant . 
  lumiar is 8 to 10 km from centre ( rossio or terreiro do pa\u00e7o ) . 
  i don \u00b4 t think campo de ourique or alvalade are central , much less lumiar . 
  it \u00b4 s as far from the centre as lisbon can be and still be concelho de lisboa , it \u00b4 s right in the border . 
  for most people not feasible to walk to baixa from there . 
  lumiar , benfica , telheiras are lisbon , but are only central if you define the whole concelho as being central which is a very wide generalization . 
  on some areas , particularly central areas , it \u00b4 s the more prevalent real estate agency , particularly for sales . 
  areas like chiado or avenidas novas , or even weirdly , intendente or areas like estoril . 
  you got remax and era as well , but for some areas , the nice stuff , more bang for the buck is more likely to show up on sothebys or private real estate agents . 
  if you are really looking to buy , doing a lot of homework on private ads is the way to go , it \u00b4 s usually how real estate agents get their listings , and if you can get there first , you got a win . 
  real estate in lisbon is kind of hot right now . 
  some areas the search is insane , people wanting to do airbnbs and stuff ( alfama , bairro alto , baixa ) , and in others , more residential areas , it \u00b4 s busy . 
  the foreign pensioner stuff , the golden visa stuff , brazillians and angolans wanting a pied a terre ... 
  nice , but not extravagant or too large . 
  depending on how central , how uphill , if it has garage , how recently remodeled . 
  2 to 4 bedrooms , garage depending , how historical or nice area or a view depending , or elevators , or stuff like that . 
  this is nice but no garage and it is uphill http://www.sothebysrealtypt.com/imoveis/apartamento-4-quartos-lisboa-graca_pt_13639 this is nice but really far from the center http://www.sothebysrealtypt.com/imoveis/apartamento-1-quarto-lisboa-lumiar_pt_2944 this is nice and central and has a garage but is 80 m ^ 2 http://www.remax.pt/condo-apartment-for-sale-santo-antonio-lisbon_122481200-2 this is nice , and larger , and has elevator and ac and a nice area , but no garage http://www.remax.pt/condo-apartment-for-sale-avenidas-novas-lisbon_121961108-150, 
  for science . 
  it \u00b4 s very tasty , but the noodles , the sauce , for me , mentally it \u00b4 s something difficult to find appetizing when it is very hot outside . 
  yeah , but some of them seem to be having a much stronger heat wave this summer than the extremely polite ( and wonderful ) summer we are having of 18 to 27 give or take a few every single day . 
  that might be truly be the universal national dish , that a huge percentage of portuguese have every day . 
  even at home , there will always be some soup on the fridge . 
  bacalhau probably , though it isn \u00b4 t just one dish . 
  had it about a week ago - pataniscas com arroz de tomate . 
  i can \u00b4 t believe the things some of you people eat in august . 
  some dishes are summer food , some are winter food . 
  some drinks are summer drinks ( sangria , ros\u00e9 , green white wine ) , others are winter drinks . 
  in the between seasons you can eat drink whatever , but don \u00b4 t you people eat according to weather ? 
   prime minister dmitry medvedev said the ban would now apply to iceland , liechtenstein , ** albania and montenegro ** . 
  wait , aren \u00b4 t these supposed to be somewhat friendly to russia anyway ? 
   serbia and israel safer than norway and denmark ? 
  that one is priceless . 
  israel - much safer than norway !, 
  and austria . 
  also , op , switzerland is european but is not an european union country . 
   that is why it is not a good idea to tell southern europeans to behave in a bus queue . 
  mediterranean europeans maybe . 
  southern mediterranean europeans maybe . 
  unless you are including telling people to ignore bus queues or actually jumping queues in which case maybe you can call it southern europe . 
  or ice cream fans ... 
  i read it as that as well . 
   that we moved the treaty of tordesillas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) line to the west because we already knew about the existence of brazil long before columbus ever reached america . 
  that is not a conspiracy theory , that is practically historically proven and extremely likely . 
  australia even also looking possible . 
   fish , fish and fish , and probably some more fish . 
  to be fair , that is of extreme interest and importance to almost all portuguese people , regardless of monetary worth to the rest of the world . 
   ps : i 'm joking about throwing the towel in the ocean . 
  we 'd just toss it aside . 
  true . 
  we would ask , shrug and proclaim loudly `` they must have forgotten it , poor guys '' but aside it would go . 
   as with traditional portuguese pendulum elections , they ( psd ) are going to lose the elections and they know it , i think at this moment in time , nobody knows and anybody taking that for granted is an idiot . 
  the glue is not unsticking in the polls , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_legislative_election,_2015#opinion_polling but more than that there are imo two important factors to why the elections could be a bit surprise - imo for either side doing a lot better or worse than expected . 
  - polls recently , in several countries , have performed badly . 
  they are conducted by phone , cheaper polls try to use taped questions , there is a sample bias , who is home and willing to waste 10 minutes or more with a phone poll . 
  all the polls are about percentage of national votes , but we all know that does not translate to number of deputados . 
  i have seen very few studies , or polls , estimating that , and imo that is a really expensive thing to poll , because it would imply needing a significative number of inquiries in all districts , and that is obviously time consuming and expensive . 
  plus , e more specific portuguese issues which can influence it still .
