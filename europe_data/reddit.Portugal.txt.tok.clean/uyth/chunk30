  that is a very manicheist viewpoint , and i am pretty sure nothing i can say will make you consider anything differently . 
  i hope you are right , that these are uncorrupt , moved neither for money nor for personal power . 
  but you are really a disservice if you think that up till now , now even ( maybe now most of all ) is being petty or does not greece to actually became a functional nation at some time in the near future . 
  i think this turned out to be a game of ultimatum . 
  the press was all going prisoner \u00b4 s dilemma but no , it \u00b4 s a game of ultimatum all along . 
  everybody loses , but justice is a pretty concern for human societies . 
   how do you expect a pensioner or a low-income family to accept new cuts and taxes if they tell them that we can not tax the very rich because their too rich to be taxed ? 
   how do you expect a pensioner or a low-income family to accept new cuts and taxes if they tell them that we can not tax the very rich because their too rich to be taxed ? 
  wow , talk about rhetoric . 
  whoever talked about not taxing the rich ? 
  i am talking that creating an incentive for companies to keep their official profits below a certain value is maybe not a very good idea , if you already got problems with tax evasion ... tax them all , and keep taxing , and iirc the proposal mentioned specifically increasing corporate tax rate from 26 to 28 ( iirc ) . 
  no , of course do not leave the big companies untouched . 
  but an extra tax on all companies with a profit over half a million , is just begging to have companies not even try to go past that profit line . 
  in a country with a huge problem with corruption and tax evasion , you should want companies to declare as much of their profits , to increase them as much as possible . 
  half a million profit , `` only a few '' companies , well i don \u00b4 t know what you mean by a few , a few percentagewise sure but if really very few in number , 10 or 50 countrywide , then fuck you guys got a far bigger economic problem than i had realized . 
  and if the companies are really that few , that tax was not going to go far . 
  12 % of half a million , times heck a 100 times , it would be only 6 million euros . 
  some of the things in the proposal seemed pretty necessary to me . 
  this for example ,  publish a revised strategic plan against corruption by 31 july 2015 . 
  amend and implement the legal framework for the declaration of assets and financing of the political parties and adopt legislation insulating financial crime and anti-corruption investigations from political intervention in individual cases . 
   greek proposal had a 12 % tax for companies with more than half a million profit oh dear . 
  you see nothing wrong with the idea ? 
  a company makes more than a half a million in profit , and then out of the suddent they get a new tax ? 
  how many companies of medium size with similar profits ( and half a million is not necessarily a `` rich '' company but one managing by ) ) might just decide to not make any more preofit than say 450 thousand ( just to be safe ) . 
  in a country famous for its tax dodging , that is the best idea you came with ? 
  when i was thinking of the rich i was thinking of owned wealth and maybe luxury purchases or `` rich '' as being of a different kind . 
  you know google , facebook , coca cola ... a company with half a million profit and say 50 or 100 employeers , give them a break if you want jobs and taxes !, 
   the problem is that all the bailout packets have a lot of austerity measures that target the most vulnerable people of the society and leave untouched the rich ones . 
  some of us ** know ** very well what a bailout is . 
  and you adjust the austerity measures as you can , and you are totally free to add extra measures to go after the rich . 
  nothing stopping you to go after the rich and corrupt , in fact from that eu memorandum , a bunch of the bailout conditions were about that . 
  if there is no money , the more vulnerable will suffer because they are the more vulnerable . 
  protect them as you can and do all you can to not ever ever need another bailout . 
  and if you get a loan , it \u00b4 s the moral obligation of any decent person to only take it if you mean to try very very hard to pay it back and worry about it as an utmost priority . 
  it \u00b4 s a good analogy . 
  and maybe you are not doing very well finantially yourself and you did loan your cousin what you could , and not without sacrifice for gas , or transport pass , or groceries or something , and then you see your cousin with some cool new shoes or a new phone you would quite like yourself , but your cousin just takes for granted spending money on things the people he is taking money from can not afford . 
  or from another perspective , by joining syriza the cousin has joined a demagogue cult which promises to detox him , despite not having any known credentials in rehab and as part of the cousin \u00b4 s endoctrination , cousin seems to not have gotten any better at handle money but think he is entitled to more money and all debts forgotten and by the way no criticism . 
  i don \u00b4 t know . 
  no , here you have to do it online . 
  want to do it on paper , only in a few conditions ( basically you are really old or iliterate or something ) , and wow there is going to be queue to get it delivered . 
  obviously a market has show up , around march you start to see signs in some small shops and businesses `` fazemos irs '' for those who would have trouble doing it themselves . 
  it \u00b4 s not without its drama , people losing passwords and above all computer issues - chrome not enabling java anymore was this year \u00b4 s drama though to be fair their site has about the shortest concisest explanation of how to go around that . 
  some years , particularly in the beginning servers crashed or became really really slow towards the deadline : i think a year it was extended by one or two days . 
  and every year they change something , some rules , but i guess that is life . 
  but i do think , even before crisis that everyyear the finances have been trying to make things easier for the tax payers to pay as well as everything more and more traceable electronically . 
  if you are worried about privacy this could be an issue , it can be a bit creepy imo . 
  waiting to see how the automatically filled deductibles are supposed to work next year , it will be cool if it works . 
   defence procurement minister he actually looks like he knows how to start a generator and is doing it . 
  well done britain , and congratulations on the new ship , may god bless her and all that sail in her . 
  the 6 % decreased rate for medication is more than fair , and actually it \u00b4 s really useful because particularly now with the crisis they simplified things and just got rid of the medical-expenses-with-prescription , and if something is medical and 6 % you can put it as a medical expense on your income tax and it \u00b4 s so much easier than trying to remember which invoice is what and trying to keep prescriptions . 
  and now with the electronic receipts and all , if you give your tax number at the pharmacy or other places ( for the general expenses deductions ) , it \u00b4 s supposed to be going pre-filled in your tax forms next year . 
  tax evasion crackdowns , lol , they are bribing us by making some income tax deductions easier or automatic , and it \u00b4 s not bad . 
  i might end up saving as much as 5 euros on income tax lol , 
  it is listed , so yeah probably true . 
  that is interesting , not sure if there is a break for hotel stays . 
  in portuguese we call the sector restaura\u00e7\u00e3o e hotelaria , and all of the sector complains really loudly about the vat increase to 23 % , as here for example http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/economia/iva/hotelaria-e-restauracao-maioria-em-alto-risco-de-falencia and they say 60 % of hotels and restaurants are on the verge of bankrupcy . 
  i haven \u00b4 t stayed in a hotel recently to look at vat tax receipt , but the rest is all 23 % indeed . 
  they really have been complaining very loudly about the 23 % in the last few years though , lol . 
  house/apartment rentals which is very usual here for holidays otoh are subject to corporate 28 % tax . 
   i mean for my daily life nothing would change . 
  i wish with all my heart that the daily life of all greeks will not change for the worse , any time soon . 
  but i think all of you need to go and take a very good look at how other people on this planet and in the european union are actually living like . 
  that is an improvement , i guess  small steps . . 
   take a look a german tax rates . 
  germany can have the tax rates , retirement age and whatever they want - as long as they can balance their own budget . 
  and greek tourism is not in competition with german tourism industry . 
  it is in competition with other souther eu countries and other non eu mediterranean countries . 
  the non eu mediterranean countries can offer much cheaper prices , but with current geopolitical problems , i don \u00b4 t think it \u00b4 s a 10 % price increase is going to dissuade western tourists . 
  the competition against eu tourism rankles . 
  because portugal has had to put its tourism vat at 23 % years ago , because croatia does not have special vat taxes for its islands , and it seems like all along greece has been trying to compete unfairly . 
  i was a lot more sympathetic to greece till i saw the exact conditions being asked . 
   the unification of the vat at 23 % even in the price sensitive branches for tourism is weird portugal had to do it some years ago and it \u00b4 s still being maintained . 
  not a nice thing , no , and i hope it will be reduced back sometime in the future as we are getting rid of the troika more and more . 
  but tourism is not that price sensitive imo , or not nearly as sensitive to 10 % tax hikes as it is to news of of say social unrest and financial collapse , and fuck it greece was competing against us or spain for example with lower vat rates . 
  as a portuguese person reading that list is downright infuriating . 
  a lot of the azores are like that but harder . 
  and they just got a smidgeon of discount on vat , and remember it \u00b4 s much harder , much more expensive to move things back and forth from our islands . 
  that list of things greece just can not accept could very infuriating to a portuguese person . 
  maybe some re-calibration of expectations from all sides will be a good thing on the medium and long term . 
  good luck and all the best to greece and the greek people . 
  may you be iceland . 
  ( but you are going to have to do something serious about corruption and tax evasion before if you want to to be iceland rather than argentina or worse ) . 
   what do you think the greeks have been doing ? 
  they 've been cutting and cutting . 
  they 've done much more than any country has . 
  i looked at that list the eu published , and i am really ** not ** convinced of that . 
  we have had 23 % for hotels and restaurants for a while . 
  the azores and madeira do have special rates , but they are actually really far ( fuck off greece , your islands are not that far ) , but they are just a smidgeon lower than the mainland vat , not 30 % lower . 
  the corruption thing , what the fuck have you been doing all this time , greece ? 
  61 years retirement age !, 
  even now !, 
  i hate the austerity , and if i could just wave it off from my and any countries suffering from it i would . 
  but fuck it , wasn \u00b4 t the second bailout already a sign you needed to fix stuff just a little bit and meant it seriously ? 
  because it \u00b4 s going to be either the all drama or third bailout and some of the conditions now deing to maybe consider we had to take them in our first ( so far only , good riddance ) bailout . 
  sunk cost fallacy . 
  no guarantees they will fix it any better than they have done in the last 5 years , or that any strings attached to money now to not have it misspent will not be ignored or considered humilliating . 
  they are a sovereign state , they have the right to exit anything . 
  enough is enough , it is going to be painful to all of us , but unions , monetary or political are voluntary , this has been dragging for too long anyway . 
  good luck to greece and the greeks , i honestly hope this all turns out to have been for the best of them as well . 
  we really need a real picture of the real vulture baby in question , because it \u00b4 s really really really cute http://www.publico.pt/ecosfera/noticia/nasceu-no-alentejo-o-primeiro-abutre-negro-em-40-anos-1700124 but a correction , it \u00b4 s the first black vulture born in alentejo in 40 years , there have been breeding pairs in tejo internacional and dourto internacional all along .
