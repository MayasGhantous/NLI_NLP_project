  this was just an effort at expanding the species into some of its older , more extensive territory , near moura and it \u00b4 s interesting and seems to be working . 
  it \u00b4 s the same area , the same municipal estate that they are also releasing lynx , btw . 
  black vultures and iberian lynx . 
  no news of lynx pregnancies yet though , but let \u00b4 s hope !, 
  really sad . 
  and no real theory about how he encountered the bacteria . 
  i wonder how many encounters of the vaccinated with pathogens go unnoticed . 
  this was only noticeable because the poor kid was vulnerable . 
  rip, 
  portugal all beaches are sandy ** except in madeira and 8 out of 9 beaches of the azores . 
  but all of mainlanda , porto santo and santa maria all clear . 
  i am not explaining this in english because no way i can translate or explain brandos costumes in english . 
  being fake or real makes a difference to what the police can do , as that article i linked to point . 
  if they are selling fake drugs , it \u00b4 s not necessarily ilegal and not much police can do except if people report harassment and are willing to testify about it . 
  something should be done but frankly the idea of putting people , even scum like this , in jail , without due legal process , to not annoy tourists is distasteful . 
  within living memory it happened , and for many other reasons , never again . 
  yes , but it was an effort on far more fronts than the criminal status of users or not . 
  but this video like most , or all , articles from foreign press make it sound hey decriminalization lead to this ( with much confusion about legalization ) without realizing there was far more behind it , places being literally bulldozed , medical centers and infrastructure created , social workers approaches changing , etc. . . 
  it is now much much better than it was 15 years ago , but it was an effort on many fronts , and even some peculiar portuguese social characteristics might have contributed to it . 
  it was almost certainly not drugs , anyway . 
  a very badly translated ( ripped off i suspect ) article about it in english http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/authorities-at-odds-over-who-should-clamp-down-on-sale-of-pressed-laurel-pseudo-drug/34895 and complain to the police if you see any around . 
   ( not all the drugs were decriminalized ) . 
  all drugs were decriminalized . 
  all !, 
  and all are still ilegal , the only difference is the ammount which is considered `` personal possession '' ffs . 
  these topics are a fucking car crash every single time . 
  i did not know that , lol . 
  that should get a special award or category in the darwin awards . 
   , but also pretty dangerous . 
  those men were spectators . 
  yep , it \u00b4 s pretty dangerous , which i guess is the reason , the adrenalin thrill . 
  like parachute jumping but easier , and with more local traditions . 
  and like others have said it is partly a rural/urban and maybe also ( at least in portugal ) a north/south thing . 
  in portugal bull runs do show up north of the tagus but just a little bit north . 
  ok and the azores . 
  i am a bit surprised these deaths make news - they should , it \u00b4 s just that it \u00b4 s far from uncommon . 
  just some google news from events in portugal http://www.rederegional.com/index.php/sociedades/12681-um-morto-nas-largadas-de-touros-de-azambuja may 30th , one dead in azambuja ( plus 6 injured , 2 of them seriously ) http://www.rederegional.com/index.php/sociedades/12681-um-morto-nas-largadas-de-touros-de-azambuja and another dead on the same fair 5 years ago http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/tvi24/azambuja-largada-de-touros-faz-um-morto-e-sete-feridos last september ( this is a summer activity stops during autumn winter ) http://www.jn.pt/paginainicial/pais/concelho.aspx?distrito=set%fabal&amp;concelho=moita&amp;option=interior&amp;content_id=4126480 two dead plus a lot of injured in moita , on two separate events , at bull runs at night . 
  and they kept the program for the next few days . 
  and more stories of deads in the same town on other years . 
  last june , one dead in marv\u00e3o http://www.publico.pt/portugal/noticia/um-morto-em-largada-de-touros-em-marvao-1639862 and that is superficial googling , there is lots more surely . 
  i think the night events are particularly dangerous because drunk , very drunk people . 
  something should be done . 
  they are all adults , but drunk adults at 2 am pushing each other , well it \u00b4 s a little bit darwinian , but still at least make organizers have big life and accident insurance policies or something , have the insurance companies lean on them if necessary . 
  google personal union . 
  and this was what i meant http://theportugalnews.com/news/british-bather-drowns-in-lisbon/35115 poor guy . 
  costa da caparica can be dangerous, 
  that you will notice on your own very fast and won \u00b4 t kill you . 
  and actually it also depends on the tide , on the sea bed , and what time of the year it is . 
  that is not the mediterranean , it \u00b4 s the atlantic . 
  it might look blue and tropical , but it \u00b4 s got tides and strong waves and currents . 
  don \u00b4 t underestimate it . 
  a surprisingly large percentage of beach deaths are tourists ( and drunken immigrants ) . 
  not mutually exclusive . 
  both . 
  and eastern europe as well . 
  though those concepts are sketchy to me , it \u00b4 s far . 
  philosophy is a `` general culture '' topic for 10th and 11th grade ( at least among the `` regular '' student programs not counting professional schools ) , everybody has it along with portuguese , and a foreign language ( english almost always ) and phys ed also i think . 
  if you can manage the portuguese here you have the criteria for the correction of this particularly exam , including that question http://cdn.iave.pt/provas/2015/ex-fil714-f1-2015-cc-vd.pdf, 
   do you want to know what happened with the bailout money in portugal for instance ? 
  some went state-driven investments ... there 's actually an anecdote i have n't been able to verify that they build 2 parallel highways that lead nowhere important . 
  i can \u00b4 t think of any highway built since the bailout nevermind two . 
  the only one who is now being built , which is sections of the mar\u00e3o highway , the a4 , was stopped for years and is now getting work started on it again and arguably it \u00b4 s a highway to nowhere important , but if you wanted highways just to connect important places to important places it would not help much most of the people . 
  and like i said , it \u00b4 s getting started again now in 2015 . 
  which roads were built post bailout ? 
   do n't know what other european country has philosophy exams in high school ( if any ) , portugal has http://www.examesnacionais.com.pt/exames-nacionais/11ano/2015-1fase/filosofia.pdf though there is a lot more concrete questions in there and just a few development questions , which seems more fair because it will reduce subjectivity when grading . 
  students are ranked according to their national exams grade , it \u00b4 s important those are graded as objectively and uniformly as possible . 
   croissants from the day before ? 
  a little bit of rain ? 
  nothing that could kill you or send you to jail . 
  they have military ( not even police police ) with machine guns on tons of places . 
  they got to think something can happen which can be prevented with machine guns . 
  it \u00b4 s really offputting somehow , but i am portuguese anyway , things are pretty quiet round here if you do not count football . 
  nobody is related closely to the people of the article and no superficial features are likely to be related to very old populations , just like red hair is not neanderthal red hair . 
  but within the reference of the posted article it is worth remembering indeed some very old indigenous very northern european are somewhat blessed with melanin ( lucky for them , they need it where they live ), 
  which people do you mean ? 
  the sami ate very very old and they look relatively ( for europe ) dark eye , haired and much more melanin favored than the most recent arrivals to scandinavia . 
  are you saying the sami are historically pale and light eyed or that they are recent arrivals ? 
  northernmost scandinavia eldest inhabitants which are also northermost inhabitants ineurope , they are indeed darker skin , darker eyes , darker hair than average for `` europeans '' and particularly for what you probably think of as `` scandinavians '' . 
  but they are scandinavians also and for far longer than the rest . 
  like say 98 % of the time in the last 500 years ? 
  we also had a prime minister like that a while ago . 
  he is now currently in prison waiting trial , and i guess that he might learn some useful things regarding timekeeping there for social reinsertion when he is eventually released . 
  that is completely idiotic . 
  portugal \u00b4 s own internal policies on this or other issues do not seem to have caused domino effects on anything . 
  if you wish for decriminalization and legalization ( totally different things btw ) in france , spain ( where btw imo for all practical effects i think it is decriminalized already ) , britain and germany wish for the final result instead . 
  and btw it \u00b4 s not `` drugs like marijuana '' which are decriminalized , all drugs are decriminalized in portugal . 
  but i doubt any of any kind will be legalized anytime soon . 
  why the fuck wish that for another country , where presumably you do not live ? 
  if you think it \u00b4 s good for a country , wish it for your own country . 
   portugal has a high depression and suicide rate which drugs can cause giving it no positive outlook . 
  not true . 
  high rate of prescribed antidepressants , which does not mean it has necessarily more people suffering from depression , but that more gps prescribe antidepressants - this is not necessarily a problem imo . 
  in some countries gps do not even prescribe antidepressants , they just forward people , which seems quite more worrying because people in serious need will receive treatment of any kind . 
   40 % report gps give treatment ; this includes no countries in south-eastern europe or newly independent states . 
  http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases/mental-health/data-and-statistics regarding suicide rates , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate they do not seem particularly , relatively to other european countries at all . 
  and a bad economy is a catalist for drug usage . 
  i think we are in agreement that 17 to 21 is nice for a june day anywhere in europe . 
  my post seems to have worked and somebody already did the swap because temperatures seem to have come down some 5 degrees since yesterday and air is flowing . 
  21 degrees max today and some clouds in the sky , it \u00b4 s wonderful , it \u00b4 s air conditioning everywhere . 
  right now , a bit more rain and some lower temperatures .
