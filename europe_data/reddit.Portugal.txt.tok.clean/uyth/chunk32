  with increased sea water temperature . 
  i was hearing somebody practice gaitas ( transmontanas i think , but i am not a expert to be able to tell which variety ) a few days ago , right in the middle of lisbon , so maybe you are right . 
  and they were quite good !, 
  and i am free to express my feelings it is not welcome to me . 
   homeownership and often higher life expectancies ( poor portugal being the exception ) . 
  really ? 
  you got a source for that , the lower homeownership particularly ? 
  in every ask anything about your country there is the obligatory american response - which gets plenty of upvotes presumably from other americans and clogs things up rather than what are to me , more interesting response from other europeans to understand better what europe is , what we got in common and in what we are different . 
  you got the rest of reddit . 
  you got askredditshould apply some common sense that questions in r/europe are not going to be directed at americans - unless they are explicitly directed at americans of course which is fair enough ... 
  i don \u00b4 t know what you are doing here , or thinking questions apply to you . 
  check sidebar maps . 
  not everything is about you . 
  i hate to break it to you , but the us is not actually `` in europe '' so they can \u00b4 t qualify for most anything in europe, 
  well , chinese also have newspapers , supermarkets and their own churches , though those are usually protestant services and the locations are not usually not loaned by the catholic church , but they exist . 
  it \u00b4 s still important . 
  because it \u00b4 s not science if it \u00b4 s not studied , and only by studying it we can find paradoxes and unexpected results , which are we truly learn something . 
  like niels bohr said * `` how wonderful that we have met with a paradox . 
  now we have some hope of making progress . '' * sometimes it is studying what we know we find the paradoxes . 
  class warfare mined ground . 
  ( well , it \u00b4 s not a serious warfare all things considered but all class conflict mined ground ), 
  yeah , churches http://www.patriarcado-lisboa.pt/site/index.php?id=4920 http://www.portal.ecclesia.pt/ocpm/noticia.asp?noticiaid=31773, 
   however , the other day i learnt that they hate us , it \u00b4 s not true . 
  we might hate some instances of history , and we might hate some current political posturing but there is no real animosity , at least between the people , though you know you guys could try harder at understanding other languages and maybe also to make less noise ( but italians also , and americans , and teenagers of all kinds , and drunks of all kinds , so nevermind ) . 
  to be fair , it \u00b4 s not the only country which is teeny tiny and whose head of states wear peculiar clothes , but yeah i see your point and agree about san marino being adorable . 
  and if anybody lost any points playing football against them , your own bloody fault !, 
  no ukrainians ? 
  they are one of the biggest communities in portugal , i think probably the biggest from non-portuguese speaking countries ( and not counting retired ex-pats i guess ) . 
  ok and china . 
  they got newspapers and supermarkets and churches loaned . 
   not hard as everyone completly forget it exists most of the time . 
  technically , op did not specify that people needed to be aware of the existence of the country , just the least hated country in europe . 
  clearly i think it is san marino . 
  it \u00b4 s very good ham , to be fair . 
  i don \u00b4 t know why anybody not needing to follow kosher or hallal would hate spanish pigs ... 
   towards the end of his life churchill was visited by a young official to discuss the details of his state funeral . 
  the official showed churchill the planned route that his coffin would take from his home to london and was surprised that , though churchill proved flexible and uncomplaining about most details , here he demurred . 
  churchill suggested various other routes and when the young official finally asked why churchill tapped his fingers on the map of london and one of the capital 's most important stations . 
  ` if i outlive de gaulle , there is no problem . 
  but if he is still alive i want him to be part of the group that greets my body as it comes into waterloo ! ', 
  not that i am aware of , somebody better than me will have to find it . 
  but that there is a joke on it , there is , lol . 
  there is a fantastic joke about freedom and frittes and freedom fries joke in here . 
  if only i could find it . 
   but not worsening . 
  best wishes to him . 
   `` we have carried out a blood smear test on 57 children who were close to the [ confirmed case ] , and the bacteria is in eight of them , '' fuck . 
  if those had not been vaccinated and had transmitted forward to all 14 % of those in close touch and so so on , not pretty . 
  and btw , to antivaxxers this is what we mean by herd immunity . 
  any news on the boy \u00b4 s situation ? 
   i 'd be interested to learn if there is a strong effort to re-criminalize regardless . 
  there is no effort or interest or serious public interest in changing a single thing . 
  keep in mind one thing though , that drug consumption decreased a lot throughout these years . 
  left wing parties make some statements about legalizing `` light '' drugs ocasionally , but there is no serious interest . 
  the minister of justice actually recently said legalizing `` light '' drugs could be good ( sure , less work for her ministry ) , the minister of health is against it ( sure , more work for his ministry ) . 
  it \u00b4 s a non-issue in portugal . 
  it \u00b4 s fine as it is . 
  it \u00b4 s all in the european drug report just published this year \u00b4 s version http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/edr/trends-developments/2015 funnily enough it is one of the european agencies based in lisbon . 
   what about people who abuse prescription drugs ? 
  are you american ? 
  i am asking because i think prescription of pain killers is very different in portugal ( and i think the rest of europe ) than what seems to be in the usa . 
  i have received stronger painkillers while in hospital , but the only person i know who ever received prescription for serious painkillers to take at home was in a terminal oncology situation . 
  paracetamol seems to be what portuguese doctors prescribe for home uses for all possible situations - you had open chest surgery ? 
  chronic back pain ? 
  anti-inflamatory . 
  your chances of going to your doctor and getting a prescription for a pain killer worth abusing are really really low . 
  btw i have received medical treatment in another country and assisted in yet another country and paracetamol was what we got also . 
  i think portuguese doctors prescribe a lot of antibiotics , way too much , and prescribe often antidepressants ( can \u00b4 t judge ) . 
  maybe tranquilizers you might be able to get , if you describe a very stressfull situation , but not sure if you would be able to get the prescription renewed undefinetely without other treatment being suggested . 
   the last time was sort of the opposite of this post , about outlier bad traffic fatality numbers relative to the rest of europe do you have a source for that ? 
  that was true , like 20 years ago , or when compared to eec back then which was 12 , but it has really decreased a lot and right now we are kind of mid table on that , and not even the worst country even if you just consider western europe . 
  source http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=e8cmo79ldj412_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=kil_mio_pop&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;idim=country:pt&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false up to 2008 , but i think lately it \u00b4 s been converging even more . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/pdf/observatory/historical_evol_popul.pdf from 1991 to 2014 , it decreased from 323 ( per million i think ) to 59 . 
  it \u00b4 s not outlier, 
   i know the ships we send are baby-sized compared to the us ones , but that was a bit mean . 
  pretty much all other ships are , at least of the ones i have seen docking ( or lurking off at the river \u00b4 s entrance because they are not crossing under the bridge or nuclear reactors or something ) in lisbon . 
  and i have seen a lot . 
  ( it \u00b4 s kind of irrelevant anyway , they can all be sunk by a much smaller sub and small coastal ships can be incredibly useful ) and sweden and finland ? 
  wow . 
  it will do you do good to watch life of brian . 
  first it will be an introduction to the concept of sarcasm particularly when applied to deflate jingoism and religious bullshit - this could be life changing for you . 
  second , i think it is a far higher standard of historical accuracy than what you seem to be acquainted with , at least going by your very interesting perspective on the history of the iberian peninsula . 
  go on , then . 
  seriously , it will do you good . 
  they were a serious improvement on the visigoths !, 
  and that was basically the official word even on my school history books . 
  the visigoths , now talk about barbarians , they brought nothing , did nothing useful . 
  the arabs they brought food stuffs , they could do math , plan irrigation , built stuff !, 
  they could build straight walls and doors , which is an incredible improvement on the visigoths and suevi - it \u00b4 s completely amazing how you got old roman stuff which is totally fine , and well done and still good for purpose , and they you have tiny crooked , iliterate writing visigoth remains and then you got the moorish stuff which is again civilized . 
  plus you know your concept of dark ages iberian history sounds really really uneducated but then again that is your own problem . 
  refugees from africa , in their little unseaworthy wooden planks or long treks through asia . 
  we keep getting invaded , southerners , northerners , easterners , waves and waves of them . 
  weirdly never from westerners , which at least is nice . 
  it was a joke g \u00b4 vnor . 
  but kind of true as well , hungarians are relative newcomers to europe , and in genetics , come on . 
  now the basques , the basques can complain . 
  they were migrants , invaders from asia themselves !, 
  1100 ( or something ) years ago , which is not * that * much time even in some parts of europe . 
  the nerve of some people . 
   portugal gained independence as duchy of oporto from galicia , not castilla .
