  hmm , a lot of food maybe . 
   city centres have been abandoned in the last 30 years , on the contrary , at least in lisbon . 
  and by the way the countries you put up as examples , and sure they are not , not of urban decay ( but check portuguese inflation in the last 100 years and compare with them ) can be deeply flawed . 
  putting up the swedish or dutch rental markets ( or the swiss as models of rental controls , what ? ), 
  as in any desirable is shocking - do you even know the problems with those ? 
  ah , regions . 
  we got one for the whole country and presumably one for each autonomous regions but i don \u00b4 t pay much attention . 
  each municipality of which there are 300 + has a municipal assembly which is elected directly . 
   germany , sweden , netherlands , switzerland have controlled rents . 
  not consistently for 100 years with major inflationary periods since then . 
  apart from tuna , i don \u00b4 t really see it . 
   - foreigners usually dont understand why there are so many parliaments . 
  how many do you have ? 
  to be fair , i am a portuguese textiles , home and clothes chauvinist . 
  shoes also . 
  italy makes those very well as well , and spain is not actually bad at both either . 
  tinned sardines . 
  tinned fish in general . 
  and more . 
  at least for portuguese https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_portuguese_words_of_arabic_origin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabic_language_influence_on_the_spanish_language nottice how it \u00b4 s so technical and related to food and how many crops , or administrative organization ( prison , customs , lieutenant , weight measurements , etc ) also interesting notice the words , at least in portuguese and spanish is probably the same which remain from the germanic people , which is much much less - words for war , spurs , stake , and can \u00b4 t find a lot else . 
  weirdly though a lot more germanic personal names survived in usage , or as patronymics , at least in portugal , particularly in the north . 
  can \u00b4 t think of any arabic derived personal or family name in usage in portugal . 
  i am reminded of that terry pratchett quote * ` multiple exclamation marks , ' he went on , shaking his head , ` are a sure sign of a diseased mind . ', 
  * and will just leave said that rent laws did have a influence on the condition of buildings and urban sprawl in portugal . 
  of course they did , as they do , for better and worse often at the same time , in all countries . 
   some say that lisbon is named after ulysses . 
  yes , some say , starting with the romans . 
  even back then they themselves cast doubt upon it . 
  the phoenician name is the most popular story , but personally the - ippo suffix connected to the ~ ~ tartassians ~ ~ south lusitanian script languages is extremely intriguing you can read some more , to why the origin of the name of olissipo or gallaecia is not so clear cut and defined . 
  they didn \u00b4 t , they took over the entire peninsula with the fall of the roman empire , and that was arguably a worse invasion than the moorish one . 
  but there were several tribes of which the suebi was one , occupying mostly what is central and north portugal and galicia . 
  suebi kept a lot of peculiarities ( religious for example ) regarding the visigoths and were themselves not absorbed easily into the rest ( a bit like lusitanians also ) the reconquista happened north to south , so a gradient north to south is expected in both . 
  more germanic influence in what was more or less the suebi kingdom is very interesting . 
  i am not sure why there is a such a noticeable effect with the border of portugal and spain , it can be some database artifact , database of placenames being compiled differently , more extensively and that affecting the stats . 
  edit , to add a map https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visigothic_kingdom#/media/file:visigothic_kingdom.png, 
  greek probably not going to show up in portugal . 
  latin can be difficult to tell , because duh , just about every name is latinized and then might be a latinized version of an older name . 
  for older names can be more complicated , even if we know what the celtic or phoenician languages were like , and for other languages we don \u00b4 t even know that . 
  does anybody actually know , for sure , the meaning of the name of lisbon or the - gal in portugal and galicia ? 
  or the river names - `` probably the name of a god '' . 
  there are theories , but none definite , nor could they be definite . 
  particularly with preroman names, 
  yeah , gypsies with blonde hair and/or pale eyes ( gray/green/blue ) , some are darker skin , some have light skin . 
  not unusual gypsy children with blonde hair , but even in adults . 
  i don \u00b4 t think the are distinctions to being darker or lighter , i see couples and family groups . 
  eastern european gypsies often seem to be much darker , and just different . 
  i think portuguese/spanish gypsies do look down on them . 
  i know portuguese gypsies do not consider themselves roma people or romani - it \u00b4 s supposed to be the politically correct term in english , but in portuguese it \u00b4 s always `` povo cigano '' , they call themselves ciganos . 
  the language is called cal\u00f3 . 
  i think i never saw an irish gypsy . 
  that one i did not know . 
  alvalade and odivelas i knew . 
  alcochete probably also . 
  the fishing trips i think worked the other way genetically , since it was men doing the fishing . 
  relevant , the disease we call doen\u00e7a dos pezinhos https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transthyretin-related_hereditary_amyloidosis but the portuguese version got more about the places where that mutation ended up https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/polineuropatia_amiloid%c3%b3tica_familiar, 
  really ? 
  what about all those blonde and blue eyed ( particularly children ) gypsies ? 
  or algarvians ? 
  the prevalence of blonde hair and blue eyes might be attributed to ethnic descent in populations . 
  in individuals , it \u00b4 s a bit ridiculous . 
  don \u00b4 t know if it makes sense , particularly when you consider a large country like portugal . 
  nobody but the portuguese ( and even some of them ... ) seem to have a clue what portugal drug laws actually are ... 
  have you read the article ? 
  apparently they do try it , but apparently language barrier is a problem , which lol . 
   `` when it gets busy in the kitchen and you start shouting in bengali , it 's difficult for a romanian to understand , '' mr. azad said , raising his voice above the din . 
  i suspect if you can \u00b4 t find the right people for the right price , if younger british asian people do not want to do the job , maybe you need to adjust your field , rather than counting on importing third world labour to keep the field going . 
  maybe , but different languages and these place names are clearly from a different origin and time . 
  and it does , far more . 
  they did not give the maps for pre-roman or roman place names . 
  germanic - gondomar , bouro , guimar\u00e3es , trofa , https://ciberduvidas.iscte-iul.pt/consultorio/perguntas/as-origens-da-toponimia-do-norte-de-portugal/16162 ( mind you , there are far more pre-romanic place name all over portugal than germanic names even in the north ) . 
  arab place names - albufeira ( meaning dam , lagoon ) , alcantara ( meaning bridge ) , alc\u00e1cer ( meaning castle , fortress ) , odemira ( complex , ode is like guadi in spanish , meaning river , mira is the old pre-roman name of the river ) , algarve ( meaning the west ) . 
  and then you got the roman and pre-roman placenames . 
  pre-roman is particularly complex because we sadly lost those languages almost completely ( apart from basque which might not be related to local languages ) and can only guess from possible similarities to celtic languages or phoenician , nevermind the other languages existing . 
  just about every river name in portugal has uncertain meaning , because almost all are pre-roman, 
  not sure if they were on their way to constantinople but some of the coastal fishing village people in northern portugal got definite connections to nordic fishermen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%b3voa_de_varzim#feudalism_and_municipalism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siglas_poveiras, 
   but houses looked like they were falling apart on the outside particular in city centres , it \u00b4 s related to decades old laws of rental control , which led to some urbanistic problems , like yeah a lot of very badly kept buildings often right smack in some really expensive areas . 
  this summer , the heat extremes were much more noticeable north , or at least not here . 
  no records yet - well they are predicting some days of 20 degrees and sun next days , but that is st martin \u00b4 s summer , coming up . 
  do people in other countries also have it ? 
  should be noticeable in spain , ireland , britain , france , not sure if past that ? 
  the azores anticyclone moves west towards europe round this time of the year, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q0secjti48 ( cuidado com o link ) and have heard it before . 
  the dictionary has it http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/grelo, 
   i 'm not sure how i feel about that . 
  soon every drug will be allowed for personal use ? 
  i mean , heroin ... that 's a big one . 
  not sure how it will be in ireland , but at least here it \u00b4 s not a matter of a drug being allowed . 
  it \u00b4 s not allowed , it \u00b4 s not legal . 
  it \u00b4 s just not a crime on itself , though just about everything else still is . 
  i think with policies like this , it \u00b4 s not the ideology or the law which matters , it \u00b4 s the details and infrastructure , how much feet on the ground you actually put - doctors , psychologists , social assistants , police ( for the trafficking ) . 
  at least in lisbon , been thinking of it recently , how many neighbourhoods were literally bulldozed down to the ground around the time of the decriminalization ( and the places still existing , it \u00b4 s like it \u00b4 s a different universe from what was there before ) . 
  i do n't give a fuck about your desire or not to leave the eu . 
  not my problem and i got no personal emotional investment in the concept of the eu . 
  skeptic or not , i do n't care . 
  but i am posting , for whoever wants to consider it , as balance , an actually factual news article who at least researched portuguese law and history . 
  other portuguese people might express their opinions . 
  now pick whichever news sources you want to take as credible ( rubicon ? 
  wtf ! ), 
  it is your own mind you fill it with whichever you like . 
  but at least i tried to give you some better data and if you choose to ignore it that is up to you , your loss .
