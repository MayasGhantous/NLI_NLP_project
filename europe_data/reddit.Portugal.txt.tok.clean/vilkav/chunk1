also known as portuguese winter . 
  germany , pls . 
  the bus door is on the driver side . 
  being british it should be on the left side of the bus . 
  it should n't bother me this much that the door is on the wrong side . 
   damned british , stealing all your good colonies . 
  serves them right for stealing them from us in the first place . 
  that would make for an even weirder border . 
  i love it . 
  i keep seeing this argument , but during d. fernando 's reign , galicia was portuguese for 3 months , so the last time we were in the same country , you guys belonged to us . 
  :d but then castille murdered all your nobles :(, 
  not for lack of trying , though, 
  but our anthems are generally musically better , i 'd say . 
  a lot of eastern europe and northern europe have rather unremarkable anthems , melody-wise . 
  at least the ones i 've heard . 
  the western romance ones are definitely the best . 
  to my taste at least , although i guess i 'm suspect . 
  campinos/forcados . 
  the former are essentially cowboys in the literal sense , the latter grab bulls by the horns . 
  [ you still lit up your whole city with our flag and followed its orders like good boys  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=traffic+light&amp;hs=wt7&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqo5kt4ojtahxcshqkhbe4cbcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=987 ), 
  well , someone has to teach you how to make proper wine . 
  i seriously do n't get it . 
  it was a close * democratic * vote , of an almost 50:50 split . 
  at * best * these cartoons are starting a pointless fight with people that do n't agree with them and already think the continent is the bad guy , thus justifying their position - especially when they took it democratically . 
  at * worst * you 're just turning your back on the other half that did fight for your cause and that are now alone and stuck in an island , outnumbered against those they do not agree with , and those whom they saw as fighting with them are now turning their backs and branding everyone as a heretic . 
  europe can and should play hardball and be the bad cop all it wants on their decision - it 's their contractual prerogative - but this snobbishness and outspoken self-righteousness is europe at it 's worst . 
  it 's uncalled for and it should have no place in a continent that continually mocks england ( it 's rarely the uk ) for having been snobbish in the first place when they decided to leave . 
  these are just getting disrespectful and needlessly petty . 
  what is the need for all this smugness ? 
  what a quintessentially swiss name , `` ricardo '' . 
  in portugal the answer is often `` where i live '' . 
   do n't which that on my worst enemy . 
  but it is exactly our worst enemy that produces * spanish * wine by definition : * spain * . 
  spain is actually the largest exporter of wine in the world , yet they do n't seem to drink it . 
  weirdos . 
  i honestly do n't know where the chain is from . 
  it 's possible that it 's from brazilian emigrants in portugal or portuguese with close ties to brazil . 
  either way , brazilian food is great . 
  it virtually removed what was a considerable naval power out of the equation . 
  2 in fact , since after that the spaniards decided to invade us 7 years later and we kicked their biggest army to that date away , which in turn left two top spots to the french and english in the food chain . 
  it 'd happen eventually , but 1755 was definitely the trigger . 
  maybe because we do n't have good starter courses , i guess . 
  if everything is hard mode , we do n't have anywhere to learn/practice . 
   chimarr\u00e3o that 's actually brazilian food . 
  although i guess we 're sort of responsible for that , in a way . 
  interesting that you 'd find more brazilian restaurants than spanish ones around here . 
  he did n't know to look for qatar and pressing up . 
  anything east of vilar formoso is basically asia . 
  it 's also on top of a *** hill *** . 
  we have the [ largest one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garrison_border_town_of_elvas_and_its_fortifications ) . 
  beware , though , it 's dry so it may shock your dutch eyes . 
  that and internal travel probably does n't count if you return home in the same day , which like 90 % of the people do because everyone lives on the coast . 
  everywhere is pretty far away , and we have our own internal places to travel to . 
  the only cost-effective place to travel to would be spain , but * ew * . 
  ( in fairness there 's not much they could offer that we do n't already have here in terms of vacationing spots or sights to see - our histories went through the same checkpoints for the most part . ) . 
  everywhere else is either far away and/or prohibitively expensive . 
  you know , unless we find a job there . 
  it was a windmill joke , martijn . 
  \\  getting rid of water \\  building a big fan seems like two quintessentially dutch things to me . 
  the rooks , the knights , the king and the queen all have more than one person in the image . 
  i counted them all at 48 or something and then rounded up . 
   the two should match wits and so , the princess married the local woodworker , for he created the chess * board * , a small wooden replica of the event , revolutionising the game by removing the requirement of gathering 50 fucking people and 4 goddamn horses for each match . 
  truly a visionary . 
  according to maps posted here , here in portugal allegedly we have one of the highest caloric intakes per capita , exercise the least and seem to be on the slimmer side of the obesity rates . 
  i think it 's because we built almost every goddamn major city on a fucking hill so you have to keep climbing just walking from place to place , which does n't count as exercise . 
  i 'd like to see the dutch with their bikes round these parts . 
  means something in portuguese , too  :(, 
  `` spanish tiles '' ( the roof ones ) is the only thing that comes to mind that actually has the prefix , but there are tons of things that people think are spanish when they are not exclusively spanish or not spanish at all : reconquista , conquistadores , churros , touradas , chouri\u00e7o , etc etc. 
  i guess i was commenting more on the inclusion of the descriptor `` iberian '' and on how rare it is , more than saying `` spanish '' is very common . 
  you just hold the huge pig leg with your pinky sticking out while you bite onto it . 
  it 's classy and civilised like that . 
  the correct kind - tall omelette-like thingies with tons of stuff inside them , not the fake round cardboard ones from mexico . 
  i think those really are spanish , though . 
  we do n't claim them as portuguese , it 's not even a portuguese suffix : we call them * tortilhas * ( which is a portuguese spelling of the spanish word ) , not * tortinhas * ( which would be the portuguese diminutive if they were ours ) . 
  the problem here was that you guys decided to call yourselves after the whole peninsula , forgetting that you did n't own all of it , so `` spanish '' is now not synonimous with `` iberian '' . 
  how * american * of you . 
  it 's really the only example i can think of of something that comes from the whole peninsula that you guys did n't just call `` spanish '' but `` iberian '' . 
  now , if only you 'd call it presunto like civilised people . 
  not even top 10 . 
  portugal , for portuguese . 
  why is it cute ? 
  you 'd still use it in modern spanish to pronounce oliven\u00e7a , 
  i know galician/portuguese has more celtic influence than castilian does . 
  this is more noticeable in the accent , although that might have also been a cause of the isolation of the portuguese population from castilian ( iberia is empty ) , as i understand nothing of irish . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a list of common words , but now i 'm interested in one . 
  op , by selecting that particular wavy pattern i feel you led people into thinking that the pattern is specifically portuguese , when it is n't . 
  you can see that pattern done in a lot of countries and regions in a lot of different paving techniques . 
  now , what * is * definitely and exclusively portuguese * is the type and technique of the cobbling , and the fact that it is usually paired with images of ocean/discovery-type stuff . 
  it is only present in portugal * , and at least in mainland portugal , has been the default type of paving for sidewalks and pedestrian avenues all around , as opposed to concrete , bricks or god-forsaken-asphalt . 
  it does get mighty slippery in the rain , and if you remove one cobble , you let the neighbouring ones loose and it spreads , so it 's hard and a bit expensive to maintain , as it is a very particularly skilled job . 
  it 's definitely very pretty , though , and one of the things that we do n't take much notice here , but immediately feel is missing when abroad . 
  now , if you do visit portugal , * do not * remove them or even buy them as souvenirs , as they are often stolen and feeding that market costs us all money . 
  same goes for our blue azulejos . 
  ^ ( * includes former colonies ), 
  are n't they all taken at the same altitude ? 
  that would mean amsterdam would be the furthest away from the `` camera '' , thus appearing smaller . 
   galicians messing up spain we really * are * brothers . 
  we also have some pretty great rivers and tides for hydro-electric and even good volcanic conditions for thermal in the islands . 
  also one of the most expensive power bills in europe , go figure . 
  if i had any trust that these euros were being put into expanding it so it could someday become cheaper , i 'd be happy about it , but apparently we owe people money .
