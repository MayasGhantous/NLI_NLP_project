  we suck at it ), 
  why ? 
  tell me good sir , what 's the problem with vice ? 
  corruption is not being a tax haven, 
  of course they are . 
  tax havens always recover ... not like normal countries . 
  same over here in portugal . 
  sure , i know that , again , i never claimed that right wing parties were always bad . 
  neither that they were always good either . 
  the fact is , by a long stretch you usually see nationalistic , racist , and intolerant views coming from right wings ... and racism in europe has had bad results ... basically im looking back at history and i 'm afraid , because i do n't know what they 'll create in europe , they could either create good results or bad results but you know , i mean you know what happened 70 years ago . 
  it 's not that long ago . 
  sure , again , it does n't * automatically * mean that , but we have history books for something right ? 
  and right-wing parties have n't necessarily always been on the bright side of history ... 
  btw i hope you were being sarcastic with the whole `` welcoming with their european neighbors '' thing ... 
  not really xd he 's the one who 's confused ... 
  well being right-wing does n't automatically mean evil ill give you that , but you have to admit that all throughout history these kinds of movements havent necessarily done much good . 
  you sure ? 
  as far as i know most counties are changing dramatically . 
  especially countries in the north of europe . 
  more and more nationalistic parties are emerging and amassing huge support , and there are no signs of it diminishing . 
  this post is only one symptom of that change . 
  europe 's changing my friend . 
  we 're going back to how we were in the past . 
  it 's scary . 
  someone 's sexuality repressed ... 
  no , definitely not  sorry about that, 
  i think i actually read this word somewhere on memrise ( which a language learning platform ) xd, 
  i 'm pretty satisfied with my city ( [ * porto , portugal * ] ( https://www.google.pt/search?q=porto,+portugal&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj1xdq0kplpahxibhqkha5xcrwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1710&amp;bih=890 ) ), 
   * schutzpolizei * i 'm learning german and i thought it was * `` sicherspolizei '' * for some reason ... 
  portuguese logic : * ** segunda-feira ** ( * monday ; literal translation : second-fair * ) * ** ter\u00e7a-feira ** ( * tuesday ; literal translation : third-fair * ) * ** quarta-feira ** ( * wednesday ; literal translation : fourth-fair * ) * ** quinta-feira ** ( * thursday ; literal translation : fifth-fair * ) * ** sexta-feira ** ( * monday ; literal translation : sixth-fair * ) ... and then ** s\u00e1bado ** ( * saturday * ) and ** domingo ** ( * sunday * ) i never understood why the week starts on the second-fair and not on the first-fair ... ** edit ** * note that the word * ** feira ** * means * ** fair ** * but only recently , because that word comes from latin which means like `` holy day '' , but because people used to do some commerce after going to church , the word * ** feira ** * started to mean like a place to do commerce and thus * ** fair ** . 
  cool , when ? 
  i like it , 
  fuck barroso . 
  i hate him , i never liked him , especially when he was in portugal . 
  he fucked a lot of stuff over here . 
  wow ... that 's amazing . 
  i agree that spain is being a little bit too authoritarian with its separatist regions , almost outright prohibiting the thought of becoming independent . 
  exactly ... 
  in a way we need to kind-of `` police each other '' . 
  foster both education and the understanding of the utmost importance of it , and the respect for law . 
  in my view these are the most important things to prevent a country from `` going from ` kinda-ok ' - mode to ` greece-mode ' `` and make a country go from `` greece-mode '' to `` kinda-ok-mode '' ... 
  concerning what a citizen can do , well i believe that the best thing you an do in the short term is to respect laws , change the country by changing yourself first , for you are the country ... * btw : i think that exactly because a country is old is it more fixed and held back by all its traditions and customs etc and thus it makes it harder for the new culture of the 21st century to settle in . 
  because i firmly believe that if you respect every single law or just the essential laws of our countries as they are written the system can work . 
  the reason our systems fail so much is in my opinion not so much because they are wrong ( although some of it is wrong ) but because they are not followed or respected . 
  i 'm also including my own country ok , if you compare countries in the north of europe with most countries in the south you 'll notice that first corruption in the south is rampant compared to the north , and the culture overall is different , they respect laws , education is important etc. 
  it is no secret why they have better societies than us . 
  if greece and portugal for that matter want to have a future , some changes , some major changes have to be made otherwise our countries are gon na be even worse in a couple of decades . 
  that 's why you have a crisis right ? 
  most countries that have crisis are basically not developed be it economically , culturally etc. . . 
  i did n't make that picture jezz get off me will ya ? 
  i just found on freaking google ... 
  i 'm not the one who 's trying to get independence , i 'm just saying that if people in catalonia want to be independent you should let them be independent , and if they actually did that 'd be great , we 'd have a better iberian peninsula ( or not ) . 
  spain ( madrid ) is the ones who 's not respecting nationalities and they should probably start listening to the people of spain instead of forcing them to commit to something they no longer believe in . 
  and you may not feel exactly as i 'm describing but i know that many spanish people feel that . 
  we kind of do yeah , but that 's not my focus , my focus is on the respect for nationalities , the one who has n't been doing it is spain by pressuring every of its regions to stick together just because of money and power . 
  i agree with their independence . 
  actually [ this ] ( http://www.nacionespanola.org/img/cache-500x350/iberismo_secesionista-500x350.jpg ) is in my opinion the ideal iberian peninsula . 
  that 's crazy . 
  cmon thats just bullshit ... do n't talk to me about conspiracy bullshit ... companies and big banks controlling both parties in the states are doing it . 
  freemasonry and all that is just horseshit to divert peoples attention to pursue something that will lead them no where . 
  i mean for instance just look at who creates most conspiracy theories , the republican party with guys like alex jones working for them , these guys are just misinforming the public , that 's why guys like trump are successful cause the people have been brainwashed , they have no idea how the world works because what they hear from these is just not based on reality ... hillary clinton is another one that is being controlled to push an agenda , and who is funding her ? 
  it 's not the free masons for sure , it 's just companies and big banks , they literally control everything ... and all the control comes down to money in politics which bernie was fighting against , and look what they did to him , they just ignored him because a guy like him doesnt represent the values of the elites . 
  honesty and democracy are no longer the values of the united states and it 's been like that for years ... 
  i never watched rt. 
  again , just because i have these opinion does n't mean im sucking putins cock , i 'm just stating the facts that the west is afraid of admiring because the us shoved their propaganda down everyone 's throat in europe . 
  i 'm not falling for russias propaganda , if anyone is falling for propaganda it 's you guys . 
  i mean just look at isis , etc all of these things were created by the united states . 
  oh and btw you do know that isis is selling oil right ? 
  who do you think is buying it ? 
  isis was planted to control oil production in syria and other places ... turkey is the main buyer , why do you think the us wants to take erdogan out of the way ? 
  because he 's creating ties with russia , the us wants the oil to flow to europe ... that 's why some people want turkey to be part of the eu ... 
  it 's all about control of resources ... 
  inform yourself ... 
  still it 's not `` all over europe '' . 
  as far as i know russia has never created warzones in the iberian peninsula . 
  so unless you do n't consider the iberian peninsula to be europe it is not `` all over europe '' . 
  too bad it actually is . 
  `` all over europe '', 
  yup at least we had a revolution where only 4 people died by accident . 
  we did n't turn our county into a war zone . 
  sure thing bro ... look up who really donated part of the food ... you 've got google ... 
  as an example of what i 'm talking about is the attempted coup in turkey . 
  it also had american intervention , gulen was in the us commanding the operations . 
  but by saying this does n't mean i 'm defending erdogan . 
  i hate him , he 's dictator , a despicable one just like putin , but if the people want to fight their dictator they have to do it themselves the problem is that the us actively tried to create a coup so he could take erdogan our t of power because again he was getting closer to putin just like your dictator was ... 
  it 's all about power and the fight against russia ... and look that 's not bad , at all , but if a country is going to fight against their dictator they have to make the decision for themselves , the problem is that the us fuels and creates these revolutions because they want these counties like ukraine and turkey to cooperate with the us instead of with russia . 
  this makes a lot of sense i do n't know why you do n't see this . 
  and you 're getting me completely wrong , i never said i support russia , and i am not for sure falling for the `` kremlins propaganda '' , it 's just stupid for you to say that , my country is democratic and i love democracy , russia and turkey are oppressive regimes , especially when it comes to lgbt people which i am part of , so of course i wouldnt support guys like putin who hate gay people ... jezz , you guys are so blind that you distort everything i 'm saying . 
  you guys are dumb , they werent giving food cause you do n't have good , i did n't say that , they were giving food to the people in the square during the revolution ... 
  that 's a brazilian laugh xd, 
  look russia is a dictatorship and they have definitely no free press whatsoever . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you . 
  i 'd be crazy if i were disagreeing with you . 
  but you ca n't say that we have free press either . 
  sure our press is much more free than theirs but it 's not completely free so we ca n't say it is a `` free press '' ... 
  free press in the states haha you 're so naive ... you should learn more about the states ... are you gon na tell that europe also has free press ? 
  everything that goes against what you 've been taught is right ? 
  haha i bet you believe there is no such thing as american propaganda right ? 
  after all , the us is the absolute good guy in the world haha look i 'm neither saying that the us is evil nor that russia is good , all i 'm saying is that just like russia the us also has its agenda . 
  and whether you believe it or not it is a fact that the us indeed played a part on the revolution .
