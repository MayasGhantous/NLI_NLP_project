  i 'm sorry , but it is a fact . 
  i do n't know but it has cost some money in the past xd we had a revolution in 1974 we had a dictatorship before that and it is common knowledge in portugal that the us government sent people here to help the portuguese military plan the revolution . 
  but its different because it was a peaceful revolution and everyone wanted it , no one died . 
  so if any of you doubt that the us can be involved in revolution , you should think again . 
  power ... 
  it all has to do with power . 
  the president of ukraine was getting closer to russia and they couldnt take that . 
  there are many documents proving that the us was paying many people in ukraine , there are also documents proving that the guy who was in command of the revolution ( i ca n't remember his name now ) was working with and getting paid by the us . 
  also during the revolution , and there are actual videos shows that most people on the streets providing food to keep the revolution going were all americans ... 
  this is not a conspiracy theory , this is all declassified , all available . 
  the problem is that european news are so biased against russia that they will literally listen to anyone that says shit about the russians ... ( by saying i 'm not saying that i support russia , not at all , russias a horrible country , i 'm just saying this cause it 's obvious that most problems that are happening in the middle east and ukraine were caused by the states cause of power ) ... ** [ btw watch this video of a german show called `` die anstalt '' and watch them tell the hard truth . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=x-9qkqy5cz8 ) ** ** edit : watch this video too https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=ckovcxav63e**, 
  of course , i mean they funded the revolution for a reason ... 
  that 's awesome ... 
  why are the english crybabies ? 
  im from portugal and yeah i definitely want to know that ... 
  right , i forgot to laugh like a spanish xd, 
  what 's so special about san marino ? 
  no government ? 
  almost absolutely nothing . 
  well , while some stats are similar we are still different countries . 
  its like me saying `` hey , why do n't you look at the danish or the german stats . 
  its pretty much the same '' . 
  we have to prevent this . 
  poor balkans . 
  i 'd like to see the stats for portugal too . 
  wtf only now ? 
  jeez , and i though the us was weird . 
  i had no idea oyu guys did n't have it . 
  but oh well , congrats , i guess . . 
  me too . 
  wait , but they are singing in romanian ... im super confused now . 
  spanish or castilian is just backwards latin . 
  towns * [ here 's also a picture of it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ixsrvbr.jpg ), 
  yes , they still do it . 
  even romania ... 
  i 'm ashamed of my country . 
  it seems like as time goes on people get less and less polically active . 
  people do n't give a fuck about the economy , politics , fighting for their rights . 
  nothing . 
  this country is being dumbed down to an extreme . 
  people go to vote but they do n't understand it , they do n't know who they 're voting for . 
  it 's shameful . 
  portugal is my opinion an example of failure of democracy . 
  in a democratic country if people do t understand politics then you might as well just have a dictatorship .

  yes there are . 
  you clearly have n't seen any picture of portugal . 
  have you seen lisbon , porto , faro , aveiro , beja , braga , guimar\u00e3es , vila real , etc. . . ( these are portuguese cities with very different types of architecture ) . 
  educate yourself before commenting shit . 
  yeah , but i honestly have n't felt like it 's winter yet . 
  even at night . 
  right . 
  i do n't even believe that . 
  just yesterday i wore a t shit cause it was so warm . 
  i hate my country . 
  not even with this wave will it snow . 
  i 'm sure of it . 
  that 's gorgeous . 
  cmon portugal is greener than ever . 
  it 's been like 15 degrees recently ... portugal and spain are pretty green still . 
  it never snows here . 
  what is in your opinion the probability of le pen wining ? 
  right . 
  it 's 5\u00bac over here in portugal and i think it 's too cold . 
  shut up america . 
  thank you buddy . 
  we love you too !, 
  everything i know about belgium is that it should n't be a country . 
  i never voted on it . 
  thank you !, 
  i knew i 'd be nominated for something one day !, 
  well it was n't just because of one or two questions . 
  i generally thought the survey was badly done . 
  this survey is really stupid . 
  the question and the answers are just stupid . 
  i was actually almost over and saw the question with germany as the only answer and then the survey question with only yes as options and i just left . 
  this is a joke . 
  always the same guys starting wars . 
  wow, 
  it 's great that you guys always have data that includes my country !, 
  i feel so integrated in the european family . 
  thanks guys . 
  we 're gon na destroy ourselves again , i guarantee it . 
  portugal is pretty much the same . 
  so there 's no way he 's gon na be president right ? 
  i think there are many counties where the prime minister has limits . 
  i 'm not sure what county but yeah there must be some ... 
  yes there are . 
  wow . 
  that 's kind of stupid .
