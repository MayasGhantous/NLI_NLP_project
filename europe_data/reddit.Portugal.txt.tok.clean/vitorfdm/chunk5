  definitely . 
  it should be considered a human right . 
  along with education , food and shelter . 
  i 'm from portugal and i did n't know that . 
  do you know if klave has anything to do with spanish ? 
  like i do n't speak spanish but in spanish key is clave ( portuguese : chave ) . 
  ** `` bicha '' ** ( pronounced `` bee shuh '' ) in portuguese means both a line ( or queue ) and faggot . 
  maybe `` rural '' , basically words with lots of `` r '' sounds . 
  everything else is pretty easy considering i use english 80 % of my day . 
  well i would only be mad if someone mistook me for a spaniard . 
  or if they responded to me saying i 'm from portugal with `` so you speak spanish right ? '' ... 
  that would make me mad . 
  it 's really good actually xd and we do n't only have cod fish , we have that for main dish and then a ton of sweets and chocolate and all that stuff ... 
  so sadness ? 
  you have n't tasted portuguese sweets and wine . 
  and even the salted cod , you do n't know what good tasty fish tastes like xd i hope you do taste it though . 
  portugal is open to you my sweedish friend  merry christmas btw xd, 
  we usually have salted cod fish . 
  portugal also had a dictatorship until 1974 in case you did n't know . 
   like half the continent was n't democratic until very recently yes , but we 're not interested in what happened in the past . 
  we are building a european union , democratic and civilized . 
  i do n't care about the past . 
  ** turkey does not belong in the european union ** ... * yet * . 
  you must be really dumb . 
  most things are identifiable ... 
  shut your ass with that anti-semitic bs . 
  neither can i. . . 
  i does n't make sense to me either ... 
  it 's okay . 
  so what i saw was a glowing disk lifting up from a hill near my home . 
  it then flew over my small neighborhood and hovered over some houses and then hid in the clouds above . 
  it flew i 'd say 20 meters above my house , and it was very clear . 
  it was moving very slowly until it completely stoped and started ascending and then hid in the clouds . 
  the ascension was vertical as was the lift off from the hill . 
  it was completely silent and somehow things like tv and radio seemed to be disturbed by it . 
  btw when the object stoped , the light from its surface went off , so you could only see this black mass in the sky and then lights on the bottom of it started flickering , like a christmas tree , and then the surface light turned on again and it started going up . 
  the surface was ( and i know this is crazy , it does n't make sense ) was glowing with an orange color , and the surface semed to be like liquid . 
  you could see something moving on its surface , the only i can describe it is that it was like molten metal , really bright and you can see it moving . 
  that 's the best way i can describe it ... 
  the shape was similar to a 50 cent euro coin when you view it from the side ... you could see some dents on its sides ... 
  yeah i definitely could not identify a fucking huge glowing disk hovering over my house with my whole family watching . 
  yeah , complete unidentified . 
  yeah , but the idea that the nwo is being carried out by a global secret society conspiracy to control every human etc is bullshit . 
  i believe there is an elite that wants to make the world a certain way . 
  it wo n't be completely totalitarian or so orwellian as people think . 
  yeah . 
  these fireballs were called `` foo fighters '' back then . 
  but sure , go on mocking me by mixing up two different things one being clearly bullshit based on one single picture and the other based from thousands of accounts over history with radar data and actual governmental documents discussing it that in 2013 i discovered wasnt bullshit . 
  i used to make fun of poeple who saw ufos btw . 
  you allways do it cause it 's got ta be bullshit right ? 
  yeah i thought that too . 
  wtf . 
  what do flying disks and bigfoot have to do with each other ? 
  i really did . 
  i 'm really not kidding , and i have witnesses . 
  and believe me i would rather not have seen it . 
  i was fucking scared when i saw that thing . 
  nope . 
  not anytime soon . 
  not until they become a truly civilized and democratic country . 
  jfk , 9/11 , ufos ( seen one ) and nwo . 
  i do n't think it 's popular . 
  i do n't hear much about it ... 
  portugal , spain , and italy . 
  yes . 
  but especially when they come back . 
  they act like they are rich . 
  plus we have a place here called algarve , and over here it 's fancy to say you 've been there , or you 've spent a few days there on vacation . 
  right . 
  if my country had n't made an agreement to make a future referendum on our stay in europe unconstitutional then yeah , i would leave . 
  it 's unconstitutional in portugal to have a referendum . 
  that 's how democratic it is ... 
  yup . 
  painful truth . 
  that explains the downvotes . 
  lots of pandering to companies ? 
  definitely not . 
  our government is just a bunch of incompetent little children . 
  i 'm biased but going to spain and not going to portugal since it 's so close its a bit stupid . 
  you 're the oposite of portugal . 
  we always get down votes for no reason . 
  nope . 
  we have that in portugal ( not the same , but rice chocolate ) and i just love it . 
  it 'd amazing . 
  and i 'm sure that that brand is also amazing . 
  i 'm gon na try to find it around here . 
  it was n't an invasion like the other countries ... 
  i 'm not being misleading ... jeez , just fucking look it up . 
  nor really . 
  well he kind of invated portugal and was n't successful . 
  at least my city . 
  i 'm from porto , portugal and my city is called invicta ( the untouched one ) because napoleon tried to invade the city 3 times and failed . 
  he may have succeeded on other parts of europe , but he never fully invated portugal . 
  ( just an fyi : in porto we have a dish called tripas \u00e0 moda do porto which translates to guts \u00e0 la porto which is basically guts , and we have it because during the napoleon invasions , he tried to conquer the city and during the said invasions the people of the city would give all the food they had to feed the troops , they only kept pig guts , and that 's why we have that dish ) . 
  btw if you look through history you 'll get to the conclusion that europe would be so much better if france and germany did n't exist . 
  like germany alone has caused so many fucking wars . 
  so yeah , we 'd be better without them . 
  a fucking dumb bitch . 
  he tried to invade portugal many times and he kind of failed . 
  yeah but no real portuguese says `` ai '' .
