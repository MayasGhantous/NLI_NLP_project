  i 'd be very proud romania managed to shoulder with poland as a benchmark for east europe . 
  uhh ... ... ... ... ... . . 
  okay , i wo n't bite . 
  let 's just leave it at that , had no idea austrians could be so thick . 
  i was planning on visiting vienna but you and your country mates have single handedly made me reconsider and just visit something equally nice . 
  your point is being deliberately pedantic , preying on the ` weak ' just to impress a bunch of circlejerking high horses . 
  portugal is irrelevant in a broader stage ( sadly ) , romania is not . 
  period . 
  i wo n't give more hungry hungry hippos validation points , so please keep on with your my action man is cooler logic . 
  this is literally about hungary and romania , you humongous tit . 
  who the fuck contests romania up against heavy weight germany ? 
  got ta love the backtrack , as i was brought up being irrelevant and not having much power are two completely different concepts . 
  got ta get your social standing back on track in order not to lose any karma - chicken tendies are expensive these days holmes . 
  lol . 
  you mean 20 million people , important nato partner who polices the black sea , growing gdp , company profit heaven , oil and gas provider for eastern and central europe , educated workforce who , among other things , were the forefathers of flight romania ? 
  we swear like sailors though . 
  it 's incredible how little i swear in my two other languages , once i think about it . 
  no man , i meant nordics getting paid to patrol south italy ? 
  such a sacrifice, 
   also i doubt poles and swedes will want to stay guard at italian costs and keep out the illegal african immigrants heh . 
  oh , you 're serious ? 
  that sounds pretty freaking uncomfortable to be honest . 
  it 's not i 'm boring but i have a real aversion to drugs . 
  i do n't think it 's morally wrong , but it 's ... unhappy . 
  you 're too logical and not racist enough for this sub reddit . 
  please leave but first take my respect, 
  it 's impossible to get by nowadays . 
  either stop paying attention to the gargantuan cowards who have never had to go without food for more than 8 hours complaining about dirty immigrants , or unsubscribe . 
  unfortunately , no one will pay attention to your comment . 
  the world evolves and so does immigration . 
  the immigrants coming to europe are n't coming over to take over like the ottomas , they 're coming for a better life . 
  like ... oh , i do n't know the european settlers of america . 
  freakin ' irish are still ruining america to this day , as are all the blacks , italians ... 
  it seems to be very hard to get this across to a bunch of nitwits though . 
  where would n't they . 
  i would pay to see genuine sources for that piece of bullshit . 
  i know , but for future reference it 's valid . 
  it 's difficult to allocate heavy budget for that , right away, 
  was it a nice , or artesenal , restaurant or just a house with some plastic chairs outside ? 
  that sounds impossibly cheap :( if it was that cheap , i 'd live in my dear native portugal right now . 
  that sounds really freaking amazing , i 'd love more day !, 
  summers until 9 pm are not enough :(, 
   porto is great for portugal if you want seaside . 
  nah dude , porto does n't have fantastic seaside in my opinion . 
  just before algarve , you have the costa alentejana . 
  that 's my favorite , the beaches are awesome and it 's cheaper/less crowded by steaks ( what we call the brits that come every summer and get bright red sunburns ) . 
  second on the transylvania part , i love the mountain . 
  it 's awesome to go hiking there , and even the black sea is pretty nice . 
  i need to check the danube delta as well but damn is it far . 
  where the fuck did you go and when ? 
  as much i 'd like to say otherwise , do not listen to this dude . 
  a meal like that in current days will set you back 10 to 15 euros . 
  coffee in lisbon is * not * 40 cents . 
  i agree with the bulgarian , as a portuguese . 
  sure for west europe prices we have insanely cheap prices all the big earners love to salivate at . 
  now , bulgaria is just something else . 
  when i went , i bought * real leather and fur * winter boots for 20 euros . 
  i had a full meal for less than 5 euros and i got drunk off 50 cent spicy rum . 
  does n't explain this community 's hatred for immigration . 
  i am very pro-immigration and i have n't met a portuguese of my generation who does n't have black , indian , other european friends , and is openly anti-immigration either . 
  but i stress - i ** agree ** that hundreds a day is not a fantastic idea . 
  people will die , i know . 
  it 's awful and we ca n't help it . 
  what we can do is take number across europe we can accommodate , and heavily invest and help large neighboring african countries such as algeria to modernize and help carry the humanitarian aid weight . 
  to be fair i judge serbians as cheeky funny bastards and hungarians and czech as butthurt xenophobic trolls because of this sub . 
  urgh , this fucking post . 
  point 1 - are you really comparing refuges from * africa * to gypsies ? 
  point 2 - you live in a multi cultural world and czech republic is not a special snowflake . 
  point 3 - implying other immigrants are organized to cause real problems , lol point 4 - just forget it , i wo n't even address the atheistic nonsense . 
  what a terrible , terrible post . 
  i do n't check / r/europe so much anymore and every time i do , i leave with a piece of turd in my mouth . 
  it kind of does , if they eventually go back to their home country . 
  but in order for that to happen , they need said country to evolve so they can go back , use the skills they learned here and open the door for a modern country . 
  except you forget the part that in order to save our european bacon , we need to help the arabs solve their issues or face hardship . 
  europe exists to prosper , and in order to do so you need a stable , contributing global economy . 
   the biggest example of ethnic cleansing was that of the 12 million ** germans and german speaking people ** come again ? 
   young males bares lots of potential for conflict . 
  i think this is the main reason this sub is so afraid of immigrants . 
  they 're young males , and as sheltered young males themselves they feel terrified of conflict . 
  they go out in public , lower their head when walking past a ` brown ' person eating street food , furiously typing on their phones how uncivilized these uncultured masses of ` islamists ' are due to their inner fear of confrontation . 
  how 's it like being a crackpot ? 
   dutch ost india company  india company  dutch  dutch india company introducing spices to yurop ** discoveries jimmies rustled ** . 
  vasco da gama did n't die for this !, 
  surprising as most romanians i know are either darker than me ( no , i do n't hang out with gypsies ) or same complexion . 
  although , i turn yellowish in the winter . 
  it 's weird , must be a mediterranean thing . 
   estonia is the highest producer of fashion models per capita an american chick i dated was the daughter of a former model , who - you guessed it - was estonian-ukranian . 
  her mom was just stunning , super classy lady . 
  also super freaking nuts . 
   which comes from debt from greek government . 
  that 's not how it works , ya tit . 
  greece is a tertiary economy , they are n't industrial but they contribute with tourism , services and they have a big significance in sea trade . 
  and i believe that answers your half baked question . 
  because of the sheer ridiculousness of it . 
  romania once brought a homoerotic dubstep vampire . 
  serbia sent an actual cherubim who had way too much angel hair pasta this year . 
  epic sax man was from eurovision . 
  it 's just really fun to kick back and laugh at . 
   like ... did anyone vote for conchita because of the song ... ? 
  no mate , it was total shit did n't sound like a fucking bond theme at all must have been the fokin beard .
