  ww1 , russian-japanese war , crimean war , is when russia lost , and there are [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_russia ) , i 'm not attesting that russia always lost , because if they did , then there would be no more russia . 
  declare war on greece after 2 days on speed 5 , u.n. declares war on turkey . 
  turkey : unconditional surrender turkey has granted armenia 3 provinces , kurdistan gains independence , istanbul is granted to greece , cyprus gains 1 province , and turkey becomes a vassal of u.s. 
  you need no cheats for the ottomans in eu4 , they 're the cheat of the game . 
  do n't be silly man , every country had its lunatics in power , some had in the distant past ( charles vi of france ) , some in modern day ( donlad trump , president of united states of america ) . 
  but being proud of your country is on what it succeeded to do , brits brag about industrialization , french brag about napoleon , italians about pizza di napoli etc. 
  thus is no shame of being proud of germany , and come on , ask anyone in europe if they like germany , and most of them would have to agree . 
  without us supplies the war would 've been no more for the soviets ( not just russians ) , get real man ; how much blood shall you spoil for a war as a country ? 
  true , but eu together with us have made a huge success in trading , science and peacekeeping . 
  i must agree with you , even if trump was elected , us government can still be seen as serious as it was always considered for around 100-150 years . 
  and , imho , a united europe allied with us is a key to help other nations as well . 
  oh they still exist , believe me ... 
  gosh how many [ pancakes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuysgojuuau ) you can make out of so many eggs ... 
  if i was russian , i would n't care less about it , poland is not the country i serve , it 's russia , and thus all monuments related to soviet union that are not in russia and are not under the protection of the russian government should not be taken as an offense if somebody wanted to remove them . 
  if someone wanted to remove [ this ] ( http://www.st-petersburg-essentialguide.com/images/peter-the-great-monument.jpg ) statue then i would have all rights as a russian citizen to criticize and protest against the removal or defamation of the monument . 
  i do n't think that every russian liked soviet union ... 
  bro , not funny , go wank yourself elsewhere, 
  most of the balkans look alike , we share lots of things ( culture , history , dna , words etc. 
  ) , so it 's not really a wonder . 
  merkel from '91 reminds me of serena evans from the `` the thin blue line '' . 
  depends on the season , one girl i know there that works in tourist field told me that usually it is very crowded when it 's the chinese year , and you can see like tons of chinese there ... 
  when i got there ( two years ago in late summer ) lets say i had a quarter of what you can see in the video , still quite a lot . 
  probably, 
  thanks god those days have passed . 
  gifts to his friends probably . 
  come on man , seeing your fellow finnish mate 's derriere is a matter of common national pride , it 's something that all nationals do !, 
  it 's pure [ nationalism ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/16/5a/7d/165a7d99bbd7ba26cf9cac054e30c779--tears-of-joy-comic-sans.jpg ) . 
  i thought second picture would show the girls breasts , still did n't get disappointed . 
  2007 * , we are in 2017 it changed a lot since then ( in 2009 moldova had a mini-revolution ) ; i even had an ethnic fight with a russian because he told that russians and russian language were superior , nice days ... 
  but concerning about today 's facts i can say that people in moldova ( mostly middle aged people ) do use russian as how germans use english , just for the internet and for meme jokes , i 'm not trying to defend anything like ethnic identity or other things . 
  i know , i upvoted your comment and the post ; i find it cute as much as you do . 
  i would n't say the same thing for [ venetians ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/rf/image_lowres/pub/p4/2016/11/01/italia/foto/ritagliweb/stampaopezzo_20161101182426767-kdgi-u109014842879930o-1024x576%40lastampa.it.jpg ) ... 
  i remember browsing the dark net and i saw besides drugs and stolen credit cards , guns , and most of the shipment is usually taken to netherlands and germany . 
  otherwise , imho , for an m16 you need good relations in the weapon black markets . 
  i have n't praised this , i 'm just stating facts , and it saddens me to see people refuse learning something new . 
  it 's true that i have hatred more on kremlin rather than on russians ( i have russians in my family ) , but i do not encourage drop out or denial of studying . 
  mate , i was born in moldova , and i know quite well `` the widely spoken and taught '' level , it 's pure bullocks . 
  the russian i know was thanks to a russian nanny ironically from crimea ( lol ) . 
  the russian my colleagues ( in middle school ) have learned in school was meager and old . 
  and the russian mostly is used in satire jokes ( like how now days you hear some teenagers talking a mixed language of english and their native one jokingly ) by middle-aged people from cities , not even from the villages ( talking about the romanians ) . 
  russians will speak russian of course , but most of them left the country ; about ukrainians i do n't know much , even if i have some ukrainian blood . 
  the only times i used russian is when i had to speak to the russian kids around my flat because they were unable to talk in romanian . 
  ahh navarra , a nice country to play with in eu4 . 
  same shit happens in all the ex-soviet countries , nobody gives a shit anymore about russian teaching at school , probably some ethnic russians do but most of them either go to russia , god knows why , or to western europe and us . 
  this is quite sad to watch , a country where 20 million people live in poverty out of total 140 million and the government instead of thinking for its citizens it invests in the `` pseudo-war '' that is coming for russia . 
  dry bread cubes/slices with aromas from what i can recall about sukhariki . 
  i do n't think that europa universalis 4 rules work here though . 
  man , `` brundipudi '' is nuts , leave him be , probably he 's as mentally ill as the hamburg attacker or even worse . 
  do you even have proof to back up your childish arguments ? 
  can you give us a source where provides us the information that this deceased man has even voted in his life ? 
  and how in the bloody hell a normal citizen would do this `` at the very least responsible for not even deporting or detaining him after his asylum claim was denied '' ? 
  and when you think about that if maia sandu would n't have passed that law with the handicapped kids being in the same class with the non-handicapped ones , the oldsters would 've voted more for her and we would n't have then to listen this buffoon with his pro-russian nonsense ... ( i 'm an ethnic romanian from chisinau , also i wrote in english so that people would get what i 'm trying to say ), 
  holy jesus ... 
  i still feel bad for that 50 y/o , he just probably wanted to buy some beer to watch football ... sad : /, 
  still he made a kill , no matter all other details , he has to go in prison for at least 20 years . 
  what ? 
  to be honest , it 's not the best cathedral that i 've seen , and i do quite like the interior , but compared to what romanian orthodox church wants to [ build ] ( http://i0.1616.ro/media/521/2863/35040/16553186/1/media-146358332772738900.jpg?width=1200 ) next to our grand [ octopus ] ( http://evz.ro/image-605-388/cache/2016-10/casa-poporului-si-comoara-care-se-afla-in-cladirea-record-465x390.jpg ) i do n't find it at all ugly ... 
  for normal people ? 
  nothing . 
  for rich guys ? 
  everything . 
  savage , but true ... 
  like it 's the first time we see them . 
  i know that feeling ... 
  british humour at its best :'), 
  finland should 've given them good vodka instead of tea , and then a sauna to relax their mind then probably they would 've stayed . 
  still i do n't see why would they leave finland , it 's a neat country besides the complicated language . 
  do you smell it guys ? 
  pure democracy . 
  wait , did n't germans always loved germany ? 
  interesting content !, 
  thanks . 
  mate , this is old news ... we are eager to exterminate corruption , but what is the point in this article ? 
  since putin is the president of russia , the best things he ever did externally to its `` former allies of soviet union '' were tumours ex : transnistria , south ossetia , donetsk `` republics '' , now days he wants to try even with gagauzia f.f.s. 
  ; i would n't try to even talk with this kind of guy because it would be pointless ; the best thing was to give him sanctions and ignore him even though it 's painful economically . 
  i feel sorry for russians who have this idiotic government , but if they like to tolerate it , its up to them . 
  that means `` god will help you but you have to work for it . '', 
  ( ad litteram it means `` god gives man , but he does not put it in the tray ) . 
  that 's why i said that i 'll pray . 
  who would n't chuckle though ? 
  if `` pul vor '' is associated with `` pul ( e ) vor '' that means `` they want dicks '' . 
  if this is n't a joke , then it 's a very serious issue . 
  i will pray for your safety and prosperity . 
  i was n't called in such manner ... 
  thank you , may your soul be blessed . 
  bloody hell , i do n't get this at all , some say it 's good by attesting that it 's anti-corruption , other say that it is bad because those currently in power will become unbeatable . 
  can anyone illuminate me with an objective answer ? 
  sz is for `` sh '' like in `` shell '' cz is for `` ch '' like in `` chance '' rz is like a strong `` j '' sound , like the `` s '' in `` vision '' and there are lots of languages that have these sounds but probably most of them do n't have a specific letter . 
  as for history : wallachian nobility had lots of marriages with bulgarian nobles in middle-ages ; since bulgaria became a pashalik , bulgarians did n't live well , it was also described in a book ( from prague to focsani ) by emanuel salomon friedberg-m\u00edrohorsk\u00fd the way of living , of those living under the ottoman rule ( not quite good ) . 
  balkan wars , bulgaria gained provinces , after a while lost them . 
  ww1 sucked for them ( on the youtube `` the great war '' a really neat channel where it is explained meticulously about all the bugger ) , ww2 a bit better than ww1 . 
  communism was bad for almost everyone in the comintern . 
  modern day bulgaria : cheaper taxes for cars than romanian ones , better roads , and god it 's more beautiful than romania !!, 
  its caves , historical places , nature , forest , sea shores , but alas , there is still lots of corruption to deal with , and i hope fellow bulgarians are eager to resolve it . 
  as a romanian , i know how you feel ... , i hate that gypsy music as well ... 
  the last time moldova `` shooted them down '' resulted a tumor called transnistria . 
  i 'm cheering poles from romania !, 
  hopefully you get your corrupted people `` decapitated '' . 
  honest working men , it 's sad that you wo n't see this kind of acts all over the world , but still , thank you op . 
  unfortunately that 's not a republic , but the heaven on earth , the place where the one and truly messiah , alexander lukashenko , is living and is using the title of the president to grant freedom and prosperity to that holy land .
