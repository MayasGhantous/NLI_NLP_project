  i think balkans won the * offensive joke about your neighbours * award . 
  ` noel ** baba ** ' ( christmas daddy ) in turkey .

   hungary is a powerful nation that enjoys ** good ** relations with ** it 's neighbors ** which neighbors ?

  you went deep in the roots . 
  it 's from spanish word * polla * . 
   just come to skim the cream [ meanwhile in romania ] ( http://adevarul.ro/locale/brasov/unurs-dat-iama-gelateria-lacul-noua-mancat-frigiderde-inghetata-1_55f10f2df5eaafab2c72b548/index.html ) ( again ) , a bear broke into an ice cream factory in brasov and ate an entire fridge worth of ice cream . 
  hey , welcome to the [ club ] ( http://s29.postimg.org/4zmbikod3/tumblr_nu793mf_os11ucp6p5o1_1280.jpg ) !, 
  i agree here . 
  that was quick . 
  enjoy your staying !, 
   which is why i do n't do it anymore , that and the shitty music . 
  well you can always come here . 
  wow that 's a lot for one shot . 
  the cheapest i know is 1 euro . 
  in the clubs they are usually 2-3 euros kinda . 
  how much is a shot in belgium ? 
   there 's no law that guarantees minority groups in parliament like romania or anything similar oh , i see . 
  thanks for the info . 
   romania really has a better one i think except winter . 
  plus here not all pubs/clubs have heated outside areas for smokers because ** all ** people smoked inside until now . 
   50 cent for a shot wow that cheap ? 
  i guess i 'm going in the wrong places . 
  [ according this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_bulgaria ) , you have 588,318 ( 2011 ) turkish ethnics , that 's a half of 1 mil . 
  and you still do n't recognised it ? 
  what minorities are recognised in bulgaria ? 
  oh , i never got polish . 
  as i said , americans say that it sounds russian . 
  but i got from a german guy that romanian sounds like an italian-russian mix . 
  exposure has an important role . 
  romanian language is like 70 % latin 30 % * ( + other influences ) * slavic . 
  americans say that it sounds russian . 
  where are you going tho ? 
  yup !, 
  bulgaria get the f down . 
  russian . 
  but some say italian . 
  edit : ** italian . 
  but some say russian . 
  [ i tried . 
  well here , the smokers ( especially those in the club ) do n't like the idea of smoking outside ... in the cold . 
  in some way , i like the way people were so classy . 
   ( finally ) exactly !, 
   some critics of the bill have said it will put an end to the country 's vibrant night life , especially in the capital bucharest where late closing hours and the freedom to smoke indoors fill venues to the brim . 
  i 'm curious if the bars/pubs/clubs will ** really ** apply the law . 
   maybe he 's a vampire ?

  / r/craiovagroup stronk, 
  i 'd say medicine . 
  why all nordic countries do n't like sweden ? 
  for him , 5 it was enough to pass because he was entering high school . 
  for bacalaureate and university stuff you need indeed 6 to pass . 
  sometimes , to pass is the hardest to do . 
  beats me . 
  that 's how it always been .
