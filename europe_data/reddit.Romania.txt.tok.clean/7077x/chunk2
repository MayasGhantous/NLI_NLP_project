  well 1 is for cheating , test 's notation starts either from 1 or 2 , so you got to have at least 4,5 ( 5 ) to pass . 
  because it is supposed to know some stuff to get those 2-4 points for passing . 
  in hungary you can pass with 2 ? 
  yes , and you can pass classes with grades above 5 . 
  happy independence day , finland !, 
  the ex-communist countries do n't buy his `` new '' attitude , that 's for sure . 
  maybe she was stressed like the other guy who blowed himself up . 
  on a serious note , it 's sad that people with access of information get caught in such vicious circle . 
   killing them basically gives them what they want . 
  that 's true because they want to be martyrs ... 
  they should arrest what can be arrested , interrogate them for informations , lock them up for life , and then destroy the terrorist groups from inside . 
  why did they kill him ? 
  he was more useful alive , for getting information and such . 
  terrorists now want to create terror and chaos in europe , because when it 's chaos it 's more easy to infiltrate and do their thing . 
  just saw the news on tv . 
  good job hungary !, 
  boo back . 
  i 'm talking about terrorists/members of isis/islamic state who post photos with kalashnikov or post radical muslim stuff online . 
  there were other terrorist attacks in europe and the terrorists had such posts on facebook , etc. 
  and nobody could get the hint . 
  they are so open on social media about what are they doing and nobody ca n't anticipate their moves ... 
   today the islamic state has some 6000 to 7000 europeans engaged in jihad or who want to be . 
  these are the people who can lead terrorist attacks in europe . 
  it 's just because they were born in europe and have european ids . 
  i guess our dream to enter the schengen zone is gone . 
  [ something ] ( http://www.bdcwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tumblr_inline_mzvoflo1gb1r3ka5z.gif ) like [ this ] ( http://www.352inc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/lucy_assembly_line.gif ), 
  i hope you know , iohannis himself is a puppet too . 
  [ president of poland , andrzej duda , came and lit a candle in tribute to victims of nightclub fire . 
  yup . 
  people here are heavy smokers and for a non-smoker like me it is not that much fun coughing from smoke . 
  i 'm not informed about those kind of systems , but ` sometimes ' it can be very hot in the clubs because of the smoke , etc. 
  and i do n't know if that will work here right now . 
  but it worth give it a try to those systems . 
  we have the law that bans all smoking in public places but in most of places like bars and clubs people smoke a lot . 
  in the clubs you can see the smoke density and it 's like a fog . 
  same in romania . 
  he was talking about funerals not candles . 
  how western travel bloggers/journalists write about the balkans : and then i made my way to ( insert balkan country ) and i discovered the greatest secret in europe . 
  this ancient land , so mysterious riddled with bloodshed and poverty is a gem waiting to be uncovered . 
  covered by the cloth of communism now i have finally unveiled the deep ancient beauty of this land . 
  this land is a riddle no one can solve . 
  there are restaurants , and people !!, 
  dressed modern , and also people dressed ancient , and there are beaches and history and culture . 
  it 's so exciting . 
  since i have discovered this magical , mysterious place now we will all come here on our holidays !, 
  there is no war anymore !, 
  there are muslims but they wear modern clothes . 
  incredible . 
  such mix of east and west . 
  ride fast , die young . 
  nice view !, 
  i do n't know if it 's 50/50 [ anymore ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pxrqc/whats_the_current_state_of_moldova/cwal163 ) . 
  i do n't think there will be a new maidan because they are pro-russia , unlike ukraine where maidan was pro-eu . 
  russian anthem for sure . 
  for me are bulgaria and serbia . 
  i ca n't choose between them . 
  i like them both . 
  [ russians be like  ( http://comediva.com/images/stories/2013/russianmeteormeme7.jpg ), 
  if there was a strategy from the beginning , we all would n't had these problems . 
  this happens , when people act before they think , madame merkel . 
  oh , the irony !, 
  it 's weird indeed , fishy too . 
  i looked up on the [ site ] ( http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=44460&amp;tx_ttnews[backpid]=7&amp;chash=1b497ee5783e426669c3e8aada172c8b#.virpl34rliv ) and apparently people are more pro-russians . 
  they want a corruption free society and they are pro-russians ... are even people aware that the fact russia is a very corrupt country ? 
  i do n't always agree with him , but he 's right . 
  one thing i 'm sure of , communists are never pro-eu . 
  the ideologies are different , opposite . 
  look up to ukraine , the communists were against eu ( and pro-russians ) and because of that they lost the power . 
  now , i do n't know what people of moldova want , eu or kremlin . 
  actually just 1 of 5 migrants are from syria . 
  well , if the pro-eu want to change the government and the only left to take the power are the communists , how are they pro-eu ? 
  same thing in romania, 
  i think his point was that , the way the western europeans treated eastern europeans for coming in their countries , it is the same as east europeans treat syrian refugees for coming in their countries . 
  but in my opinion , these are different situations , reasons and such . 
  welcome to the western democracy , we got euros . 
  indeed . 
  what you just said , it remined me of anders behring breivik and what he did in 2011 . 
  [ you said it . 
  in usa you got guns , but here in europe we got knives . 
  edit : it 's sad to see how some people do n't know what satire is . 
  that 's russia for you . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  well done , good neighbor bulgaria . 
  [ indeed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ), 
  what a surprise !, 
  that wall should have been on the border with turkey not in the center of europe . 
  moldova always was run in the shadow by putin . 
  he has people in politic to do the job for him , just like it was in ukraine . 
  look what happened to ukraine when eu came in help , russia started a war in east of ukraine , stole crimea etc. 
  and now it started in moldova with those protest where russian people are brought into the country to protest against eu . 
  when you come in a new country , you adapt to the country , not country adapts to you . 
  that 's the rule . 
  my point in the beginning was that germany alone invited all those refugees without consulting the rest of the union.i am not saying this because i 'm against the humanitarian side of the move , i 'm just saying that the number of refugees , balkans and other poor countries can take , was not taken in into consideration . 
  you do n't know but everyday more refugeees ( not only from syria ) are coming and the western countries slowly close their borders , that means that more refugees are stuck on balkans where obviosly , these countries are poor . 
  we do not refuse help but we were not asked how much of it we can really help . 
  that 's true , but help can come in many ways . 
  i agree with you there . 
  and again , i never said no to refugees . 
  why there is n't any arab country ( like qatar , united arab emirates , saudi arabia , kuwait ) helping the refugees ?
