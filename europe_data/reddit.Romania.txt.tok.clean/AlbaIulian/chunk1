not to mention the eternal classic futu-\u021bi mor\u021bii m\u0103-tii . 
  ( fuck your mother 's dead relatives '' ) , and the way that transylvanians can turn even the most innocuous thing into swearwords . 
  `` futu-\u021bi dracii m\u0103-tii s\u0103-\u021bi fut , s\u0103-\u021bi dea dumnezeu cu pita peste fa\u021b\u0103 '' ( fuck your mother 's devils and may god strike your face with bread '' . 
  me neither , and i 'm european . 
  fml . 
  hmm . 
  hard to say as i enjoy a relatively wide smattering of songs , so i am rather inconsistent . 
  generally mainstream ; classical , pop , some rock and rap here and there , even some romanian turbofolk because balkans . 
  in short , plenty . 
  * are there a lot of places to see live music ? 
  no idea . 
  probably some parties like weddings or baptisms at most . 
  otherwise , prafctically nothing . 
  * what kind of music are they playing ? 
  mostly folk or lautareasca . 
  * how often do you personally go to see live music ? 
  never . 
  not really interested . 
  wealth : the north ( by which i mean transylvania ) has a reputation of being generally wealthier than the south , which has bucharest and . . aside from that not much really . 
  talking west and east , there 's a bigger difference ; the west part is clearly wealthier than the eastern part . 
  demographics : west ( transylvania ) has far more hungarians , some croatians , banat bulgarians , serbians and some germans . 
  east has more gypsies , and in the far south-east ( dobrogea ) there are some greeks , lipovan russians , tatars and turks . 
  the remnants of the italians also can be found in bucharest , and the aromanians make their home typically in the south and southeast . 
  geographical : north is hilly , south is flat . 
  probably restructuring the parliament into an unicameral one with a fixed number of seats ( 300 ) . 
  but aside from that , there are n't that many . 
  not really typica breakfast : usually skipped over lunch : depends on day ; try to vary it over the course of a week , but usually consists of chicken dishes , pizza/pasta or shaorma . 
  dinner : again not really eaten ; sometimes pasta or yoghurt . 
  yes . 
  aside from the numerous dacopaths ( dacians gave the romans latin , einstein plagiated eminescu , the truth about romania being the # 1 's in all is hidden in the secret vatican library and so on ... ) we also got anti-vaxxers , probably chemtrails as well and so on . 
  not really . 
  of course . 
  '' it was bad with der die das but it 's worse with davai ceas '' over here , people certainly thought the opposite ... 
  charismatic fellow , emblematic of the 80 's for some . 
  i appreciate that he was hard on the ussr . 
  maieu , but some say it somewhat like maiou - ro, 
  a geographic entity . 
  over the years i 've found myself steadily drifting rightwards . 
  i 'd say i 'm pretty firmly entrenched within the `` tory '' camp right now . 
  shaorma with everything . 
  vytautas mineral water !, 
  it 's earth 's juice !, 
  i certainly do n't feel that way tbh . 
  i 'm an outsider because i do n't drink coffee . 
  neither do i touch tea or alcohol . 
  over here we generally use `` evanghelic '' ( evangelical ) as a synonym for lutheran or older churches that developed from that tradition . 
  we also use the term `` poc\u0103it '' for reformed or certain newer protestant movements like the pentecostals or the adventists . 
  `` protestant '' would be an umbrella term for all . 
  not common over here . 
  fine by me to be honest . 
  the most common over here are : salt , paprika , cheese , sour cream and dill , onion and cream , barbecue and chicken . 
  there 's also chili and the limited edition flavors like shaorma or meat and mustard . 
  in a word , yes . 
  none atm . 
  there is no party over here that truly represents me tbh . 
  psd , because of the corruption degree among other mishaps . 
  grand canyon and niagara falls are the most well known . 
  try telling that to the balkan countries . 
  we love moonshine . 
  ( not me though ), 
  victoria 2 : covers the 1836-1936 period . 
  rome total war : any of the 3 roman factions . 
  rome 2 : rome . 
  empire : france , plc , russia , turkey . 
  medieval 2 : mostly use stainless steel , and even then it 's byzantium , screw you seljuks and fatimids . 
  if going catholic , it 's the hre or france . 
  ck2-varies , but i always held a sweet spot for persian and roman restorations . 
  also , screw hungary . 
  eu4-sworn enemies : ottomans , hungary , the mamluks , venice , austria ; unfortunately wish i were better to restore byzantium . 
  otherwise ... not sure , probably france . 
  v2 : usa , russia . 
  sworn enemies : communist rebels , ottoman empire , austria-hungary . 
  hoi4 : germany , romania . 
  sworn enemies : the ussr , the allies . 
  civ 5 : i 'm not that good , but i like rome , france and russia . 
  fuck you spain and england . 
  age of empires iii : russia and the aztecs . 
  no real enemies here , just who the computer puts against me . 
  according to [ this website ] ( http://nume.ottomotor.ro/ ) only 58 people share my last-name , and mostly around transylvania . 
  if the guy wants to hire people to cultivate it in his stead ... his problem . 
  does n't concern me what he is doing on his land . 
  the territorial losses of 1940 as well . 
  not very common over here ; never joined either . 
  summer camps and other such activities never attracted me . 
  people generally get along with each other . 
  some mild ribbing is to be expected , but there 's not much in the way of fights . 
  flair checks out ... until you realize there is no mention of dear leader . 
  romanian : * ro\u0219u ( red ) * portocaliu/oranj ( orange ) * galben ( yellow ) * verde ( green ) * albastru ( blue ) * indigo ( indigo ) * mov/violet ( purple ), 
  agreed . 
  not really . 
  was n't that into reading while younger , and never heard of those at the time . 
  even now i am not that much into reading . 
  yes , to say the least . 
   do church leaders have leverage on daily politics , meaning , are they in touch with politicians ? 
  yes , especially with the psd ones . 
  [ they ] ( http://www.debanat.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/icoana-psd.jpg ) [ picked a clear side during the presidential campaign ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/186/3927/13532077/2/646x404.jpg?width=1200 ) . 
  *  how much is church influential on desicions of government ? 
  they 're almost untouchable in that regard ; a big fuss was kicked up when the religion class was made elective instead of practically-mandatory , as it was until that point . 
   how much power , influence and wealth does church as organization have today in your countries ? 
  power : plenty , they can be a dangerous foe and a powerful ally .
