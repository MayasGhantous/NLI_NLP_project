  rip in peace , tribune :( * other times it 's stuff like exaggeration of politicians themselves ( basescu being a drunk sailor or mazare a womanizing costume afficionado ) or reminiscing of stupid statements , like `` summer 's not like winter '', 
  * mare nostrum intensifies *, 
  we do n't really care bout such things , even if they 're taught in school ; stuff 's measured by how crooked are the parties/politicans , from a scale from mafia to clean . 
  yeah , he does n't seem like too much of a sympathetic guy . 
  ok dougal , now repeat after me : these are small , but those are far away . 
  small ... far away . 
  great man , i tell ya . 
  actually beginning to identify as a gaullist over here to a degree . 
  no idea , either focsani or brasov . 
  focsani due to being the center of some common institutions during the time that they were separate , when we transitioned from wallachia + moldova to one romania . 
  and brasov ... central location , i guess . 
  let 's see ... post-1989 presidents were : * ion iliescu : hydroelectric engineer , communist party activist * emil constantinescu : university geology professor * traian basescu : merchant navy captain , mayor of bucharest * klaus iohannis : physics teacher , mayor of sibiu . 
  so , regarding presidents , there 's no real pattern . 
  just get in a party , hope you get to a mayor seat , and then afterwards , continue the upward climb . 
  now , regarding prime-ministers , after 1989 . 
  interims not counted : * petre roman : engineer . 
  * theodor stolojan : economist , worked at the commitee for state planning . 
  * victor ciorbea : jurist , currently ombudsman . 
  * radu vasile : professor * mugur isarescu : economist , currently governor of the national bank * adrian nastase : lawyer * calin popescu-tariceanu : engineer , currently president of the senate . 
  * emil boc : jurist , currently serving as mayor of cluj . 
  * victor ponta : prosecutor * dacian ciolos : agronomic engineer , eu commisioner * sorin grindeanu : it-ist probably . 
  so , again , no clear pattern . 
  i usually cheer for whoever i like most tbh . 
  so if it 's netherlands vs argentina , i 'd cheer argentina :p, 
  nobody really watches tvr . 
  they got some ok-ish stuff every once in a while , however . 
  romania : yeah in a way , kaufland , lidl and sometimes carrefour are popular . 
  bunch of crooks and idiots . 
  yeah , that . 
  smallest coin : [ 1 ban ] ( https://images.okr.ro/serve/auctions.v7/2016/aug/22/480f6416ed193d4627cb967a9a27a123-7025997-1000_1000_11.jpg ) : 0.0022 cents . 
  largest coin : [ 50 bani ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/ro-2009-50bani-a.png ) : 0.1098 cents .

  i like our money for one tbh . 
  meh , i 'd rather sleep . 
  catching up on the lost sleep during the week . 
  practically never . 
  only once , and i guess he was a tourist . 
  too bad . 
  he could 've merged the two once he became king ( tricolore smattered with gold fleur-de-lys or something ) or inserted a coat of arms with some fleur-de-lys in the tricolore had he just swalowed his pride for a bit ... darn . 
  mine was inhabited since dacian times , and became the capital of the roman province of dacia apulensis after the roman conquest of dacia . 
  after the aurelian retreat , it went into a decline only to reappear around 1199 with the current name . 
  it 's been there ever since . 
  got no problem with it tbh . 
  we do n't really have a film industry to speak of , so no idea . 
  then again , i do n't really give a damn about movies . 
  people over here were and largely are against it . 
  the migrants were like that as well ... 
  i remember that an afghan guy started crying when he found out he was sent to romania xd, 
  us , most likely . 
  probably somewhere slightly mountainous with a warm climate ( screw the cold ) . 
  in school we 're taught uk english , altough i generally write using the us spelling . 
  comes across as more natural to me . 
  while speaking ... 
  it 's rather unclear , sounds like something in between with a slight dose of eastern europe . 
  romania : the home of dracula , turbofolk and balkan nonsense . 
  run while you can . 
  i , personally , not much aside from history and language and some values . 
  i 'd say that azor/azorel would be the proverbial dog name . 
  nothing . 
  parliamentarians are on vacation . 
  yeah , similar . 
  not really , it 's just kinda there , but nobody bothers to watch . 
  meh , part of the jews ' culture . 
  who are we to tell them to change that ? 
  pineapple is good indeed . 
  ham and salami, 
  ate a pizza today . 
  no , only to taxi drivers , as regarding buses and trams ( what i assume you mean by streetcar ) you get off in the back , not front . 
  yep , they do help . 
  i wish that we still had ours . 
  would 've been a nice beacon of stability in these days . 
  probably right-wing . 
  comparing the 1938 constitution ( fun fact : first authoritarian constitution also gave women the right to vote , though a bit later than the men ) vs the 3 commie constitutions , former seems more preferrable if given the choice . 
  ( of course , with some old-fashioned propositions regarding women 's suffrage abolished ) . 
  probably right-wing . 
  comparing the 1938 constitution vs the 3 commie constitutions , former seems more preferrable if given the choice . 
  ( of course , with some old-fashioned propositions regarding suffrage abolished ) . 
  yeah , and i have n't met anyone actually following it over here . 
  it 's just like the olympics , where people act proud that romania won a medal , but then return to not really giving a shit the rest of the time . 
  not really popular . 
  in comparison to football , it 's a pale shadow . 
  do n't really see it growing . 
  quintillius varus , give me back my legions !, 
  not common , have n't seen anyone doing so . 
  it 's my home , where practically everything dear to my heart is . 
  despise the psd though . 
  ( articulated : domnul/doamna ) means sir/madam . 
  romanian first . 
  usually the traffic lights would be flashing yellow at that time . 
  otherwise , genuinely do n't know . 
  most people would probably wait from what i know , even if it 's frustrating , altough some might choose to just floor it . 
  i 'd say so , and it is a rather big problem over here . 
  thankfully , there 's no more smoking in closed public spaces , but underage smoking 's rather prevalent . 
  * nope , it 's part of the 7th grade biology curriculum : anatomy , section reproduction . 
  * male and female genital systems , pregnancy , and contraception ( with a certain emphasis on the fact that abortion is the last-resort ) , and std 's . 
  * depends on what age you 're in the 7th grade in . 
  usually around 13 or so . 
  * not much to add . 
  no real ritual . 
  as soon as i wake up via alarm clock ( around 7:07 ) , i get dressed , brush quickly my teeth , drink some water and leave for school asap .
