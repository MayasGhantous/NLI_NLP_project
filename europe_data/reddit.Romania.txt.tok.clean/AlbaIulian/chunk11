  florescu , probably . 
  the expression `` copil din flori '' ( child from flowers ) means child born out of wedlock , and '' - escu '' used do mean `` son of '' . 
  so , basically , while others would have ionescu or popescu , ( son of john or priests ' son ) , florescu would be `` flowers ' son '' , aka flower child , or bastard . 
  generally i 'd say people think of him in a neutral but somewhat positive way over here . 
  personally , i have a positive opinion of napoleon . 
  oh , there was splinter as well : players had to stand in a circle , holding a leg out so that the shoe ends touched . 
  then they said `` 2 ... 3 ... and ... 
  splinter ! '', 
  and pull their legs back at the same time . 
  then , taking turns , they attempt to eliminate the others by stepping on their feet ( but they have to make only one move per turn ) whilist avoiding being eliminated themselves . 
  last man standing is the winner . 
  there were also tag ( prinsa or leapsa ) and hide and seek ( v-ati ascunselea ) and clapping games . 
  and the ever-popular football . 
  regarding regulations , it 's rather freely sold in supermarkets or markets or anything . 
  do n't know of any happy-hours to speak of . 
  aside from that , idk . 
  universally you can only drink and buy from 18 , but that does n't stop particularly ambitious highschoolers from just buying some stuff anyway . 
  alcohol in advertising ... can happen every once in a while , altough i do n't really see tuborg or bergenbier or beciul domnesc ads as often as in past years . 
  drinking in public ... genuinely no idea . 
  in my case , number of classes per day depends based on plenty . 
  but generally , classes last about 45 mins , about 2 breaks 15 mins each for classes 5-8 . 
  ( 10:15 -10:30 and 12:00 -12:15 ) high school gets the second break cut in exchange for going home 15 minutes earlier than the middle-schoolers . 
  over here : full of delicious scandal , fine-looking but boring 2016 , back to the old wonderful circus . 
  our john smith would be ion popescu , or ion ionescu . 
  for females ... probably maria popescu or maria ionescu . 
  our equivalent of average joe would probably pulic\u0103 fr\u00e2naru , but that is used in far more informal contexts . 
  more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_placeholder_names_by_language#romanian ), 
  i have a general respect for the men in the armed forces and the institution itself , so a generally fine one . 
  the men themselves ... do n't know , never met an american soldier once , but would like to . 
  they 're generally far more behaved over here than the russians , when they came in the late 40 's and stayed till the early 50 's . 
  men can be men , so they can be very different between one another , that 's fine . 
  but a common goal of protecting the country ... 
  i respect this . 
  generally it 's `` alo '' , or sometimes `` da '' . 
  no , but there is a degree of euroscepticism in my circles . 
  which i am glad exists . 
  god no . 
  it is religious to a degree . 
  religion classes can be chosen by some students , people occasionally go to church , generally it increases if you go in rural areas . 
  personally i got no problem with organized religion , given that i have fondness for order and organization in general . 
  sure , people are corrupt , but we 're people after all . 
  it 's always gon na happen . 
  there 's the trinitas tv channel , which i believe is owned by the orthodox church . 
  aside from that , there may be smaller ones owned by smaller reformed churches , but they are n't really that relevant . 
  i would n't flee . 
  i 'd probably stay behind and try to help as much as possible . 
  appear unconspicuous while trying to secretly sabotage . 
  then , when the time comes , take up arms and help liberate my town or country . 
  george washington . 
  the fact that sz is s and \u015b is sh . 
  and \u00e1 is a and a is o. . . and your weird pronunciations in general . 
  adidas tracksuits . 
  yep , they 're weird , but got used to them . 
  eh , the compound words are n't as bad . 
  whatever was on cartoon network at the time . 
  * tom and jerry * ed edd n eddy * the cramp twins * knd : kids next door * courage the cowardly dog how much time has passed ... still glad i got the dubs instead of the subtitles . 
  the bloody articles , and to a lesser degree , verb placement . 
  it 's odd having to place them at the end while in romanian it can go almost everywhere it wants . 
  good one . 
  even better . 
  5 or 3 doctors ' approval to determine that the decision is n't made out of desperation , which can drive people to say the darndest things would be fine . 
  but still , it 's chilling . 
  well , what else ? 
  turbofolk or what ? 
  * [ the eternal classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hr4hp_-ksi ) * [ for my occasional folk-rock needs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) * [ and then 3 sud est , because why not . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ltklk0x4o4 ), 
  yep . 
  andrea , azis and ork ... just balkan things , knowing a country by the turbofolk singers  ), 
  nah , takes a bit of practice , but once you get the tone it 's surprisingly easy . 
  the russian anthem is wonderful . 
  guess our saying about romania ( beautiful country , shame that people live in it ) can apply to your land as well . 
  everyone knows at least part of it . 
  i like hearing it , fills my chest with pride , makes me remember why i love being romanian sometimes . 
  i can sing most of it . 
  as for other countries ' anthems , i mostly know the more militant ones . 
  more rousing , more memorable , i guess . 
  interwar one `` deutschosterreich du herrliches land '' is fine as well in my book , but kuk anthem really is something . 
  i 'd say manele ( our turbofolk/chalga ) are rather popular over here . 
  whether people like them or not , everyone knows at least one . 
  there have been incidents where people 've been beat up for listening to them in the tram without headphones , but aside from that , they are almost a must for parties . 
  i want to be alone . 
  fuck aliens . 
  it may be so , but i actually find it far more easy on the eyes than modern glass stuff or old commie-era apartment buildings . 
  i do n't really like them because : 1 ) they do n't fit their surroundings , especially here . 
  2 ) they can enhance the sun 's brightness , which is n't too good for my and other people 's eyes . 
  3 ) they look just awful compared to older ones , especially neoclassical buildings . 
  yep , got no problem with that . 
  let him come . 
  [ as i thought . 
  i like that he 's been nicknamed `` the incorruptible '' , but otherwise i think of him as a guillotine-loving tyrant . 
  ye , but it gives a small idea of our curses ' inventivity  ), 
  ( no offense , meant as an example ) as you can see , we can get very ... creative . 
  romance , obviously , because latin . 
  others , i guess : other indo-european families , faintly interested in tibeto-burman , na-dene and hebrew . 
  not common at all ; for smaller purchases or when going out , the leu is preferred . 
  euro is used very rarely , probably only with very expensive stuff . 
  yay for the ron . 
  the almighty promaja/curentul . 
  #justbalkanthings . 
  it 's common here , but i doubt that [ sour cream and dill ] ( http://www.masafestiva.ro/custom_images/produse/pop/5cd133f11.jpg ) chips are popular elsewhere .
