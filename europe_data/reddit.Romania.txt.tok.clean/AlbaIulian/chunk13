  continue until none are left . 
  such positions are fringe over here . ^ and ^ fringe ^ they ^ should ^ remain, 
  do n't really care , what they do in their country is their business . 
  do n't really like psd and alde either , altough i do n't really lean towards liberal parties myself , only towards the most anti-psd ones i notice . 
  a proper conservative party is rather hard to find here , and psd is the mafia . 
  art , german , history , and english . 
  * rise of competent right-wing leaders to unseat the psd * for the psd to go to jail already * expansion of cernavoda nuclear plant * continued economic growth * more referendums to see if eu is viable or not anymore ( if everyone votes to leave , then time to jump ship ...  ) * a reduction in eu involvement over here * for fillon to win * for merkel to lose ( preferrably to someone who is more right-aligned ) * states to gain more importance at eu 's expense . 
  second-largest gdp among the german states , from what i know . 
  so , rather powerful . 
  to both : we do n't really have that many jews anymore ; most were `` sold '' to israel by ceausescu or left the country anyway . 
  or were killed in wwii . 
  as such , people are mostly neutral towards jews , but there is a cringeworthy ultra-nationalist minority , usually of the dacopath type , that blames jews for plenty of bad stuff ( because psd ca n't go wrong , it 's soros . 
  ciolos does ok and psd is n't ? 
  soros . 
  and so on . ), 
  as such , jews in modern romania would generally be fine . 
  a giant shitshow , and i love it . 
  ripe for a resurgenge of a proper right . 
  because pensions , impossible promises , bribery , apathy , and the `` bread and circus '' projects of diverse psd mayors in bucharest , resulting in the following exchange : `` yeah , they stole , but at least they did something for the town as well '', 
  no , it should not , and i hope that this wo n't happen in the foreseeable future . 
  while european nations have much in common one with another , i would n't say that there are things that every european country shares aside from very broad-stroke things , like country and dishes . 
  regionally , you 'll find more shared beliefs and traditions , however . 
  not to mention that the eu will never , and should never , be a country . 
  it 's a big mess right now , caused by its attempts to envelop most of the functions that properly should be performed by a sovereign state : minting currency , defense , and organizing its political system . 
  also , the bureaucracy needed to run an entire continent ( or at least a big portion of it ) will be staggering , and i know cases where ordinary people have been screwed over due to eu regulations and their ilk . 
  not to mention that the current of internationalization that affects us today is affecting the national identity of the states in a very negative way ; instead of working for companies in the motherland , people instead have jobs working for foreign companies , feeding more money to germany than to romania . 
  and the guys in bruxelles have no way of knowing what is best for romania , for example . 
  over the time , the countries on the european continent have developed individual cultures , which , while influenced by their neighbors , are still distinct . 
  so , what might be a good idea for some countries in western europe may be a disaster for the east . 
  attempting to smooth out the differences between east and west would never turn out well in a sane world , and it goes against the uniunea lu ` peste 's motto `` unity in diversity '' . 
  if the union truly respected that , then they would n't attempt to slowly drive us into abandoning our old , slower-paced way of life for the urban-centered hustle-bustle of the west . 
  both might have their flaws , but a foreign model is very bad if imported rapidly . 
  maiorescu said it himself that '' * the second , and most important truth , is this : the foundation-less shape ( imports from the west not adapted to our circumstances ) is not only useless , but very damaging * ... * it 's better to not make a school at all than make a bad school * '' said my piece . 
  people from rural areas are generally stereotyped as voting for the psd ( social-democrats/the mafia ) , due to their practice of always promising bigger pensions and offering oil , sugar , flour and such things to people who vote them . 
  urban areas , it 's not very clear . 
  vote over here is mostly split over regions than rural/urban . 
  moldova and wallachia are psd strongholds , transylvania 's for the most part the domain of the pnl ( national-liberals ) , the hungarian areas are the home of the udmr ( magyar party ) , and bucharest 's a mix between psd and usr ( new kids on the block , against corruption ) . 
  there 's no `` right '' or `` left '' in romania . 
  parties might call themselves one way , but act another way . 
  so , i 'd say variable . 
  in broad strokes i 'd paint the psd as left-leaning , and the pnl as right-leaning , and given the pnl 's rather bad result in the new elections , it 's in a shaky state . 
  hope , however , that the right recovers and blows the psd out of the water . 
  israel is seen as rather ok in my country ( given we do n't talk about it often , and we 're generally ok with countries we do n't talk about . ), 
  people do n't really care , and i personally lean towards israel . 
  proud : * we still know how to take things slow every once in a while * still bound by tradition in many ways * hearty people , like to live well * wonderful landscape * trying to get rid of corruption dislike : * we seem to be overly-willing to bend knee to brussels in many regards * we still elect the psd in power despite it being corrupt * respect for tradition and the old ways seem to be dwindling among younger folks * some people keep wanting to increase the welfare state despite that being the last thing we need right now ; our economy ca n't take it * can be rather servile to brussels , altough i like that we voted no for the quota thing last year . 
  * educational system is rather bad ; no encouragement for kids to go into trades instead of going to college . 
  glorious !, 
  conference of paris unwittingly allowed moldova and romania to unite after the crimean war , 1848 revolutionaries over here were educated in the west ( france ) , belle epoque romanian nobles and upper-middle classmen were fascinated with french culture and expressions to the point of peppering their speech with frenchisms ( immortalized in caragiale 's plays , parol d'honneur ) . 
  we fought on the same side during wwi , france supporter our little entente ( us , czechoslovakia , yugoslavia ) during the interwar era , and french is taught in a vast majority of schools as a foreign language ( during communism that spot was filled with russian ) . 
  we are also part of the francophonie and plenty of exiled romanian cultural figures lived in france ( like eugen ionescu , emil cioran or constantin brancusi ) . 
  and the eiffel tower was ( do n't know in which proportion ) built from [ steel prepared in resita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/re%c8%99i%c8%9ba_works#beginnings_and_growth ) , at the time located in austria-hungary . 
  so , yeah , romania and france share substantial ties , which , while not to the level of poland and hungary , are still important . 
  too bad that the little paris ( bucharest ) has declined greatly in recent days . 
  yep . 
  we initially had [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/flag_of_the_united_principalities_of_romania_%281862_-_1866%29.svg ) then decided to turn it around to [ what it is today ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/flag_of_romania.svg ) because we were big francophiles at the time , parol d'honneur . 
  ( tv , not radio/music ) yep . 
  there 's no revelion without dan negru 's antena 1 new year 's special . 
  is n't dacian a similar case to daciana ? 
  and i guess tudor would count as well . 
  or calin . 
  [ the vadim all romanians know . 
  not really . 
  i prize my country 's culture being as it is , and people would be up in arms over here if you suggest that romanians might become a minority in romania . 
  do n't really believe that romanians might become a minority anytime soon , though , but we have to fix our fertility rate in order to fully avoid the danger . 
  romanian . 
  in school you get the choice to learn either french or german ( rather despised classes ) and later on , english . 
  altough only some people leave school knowing much french or german . 
  i personally know german and english . 
  other languages , a few words or probably a few simple sentences at most . 
  hehe , i happen to live outside of the citadel , but i 'd gladly do away with some parts of the town . 
  nah , i just find some of the more liberal laws of the netherlands regarding euthanasia and narcotics too much to stomach . 
  otherwise , i 'm relatively neutral . 
  personal dislike for some of the local attitudes , i guess . 
  otherwise , i 'm neutral . 
  i 'd go for the netherlands and for sweden at any rate . 
  doubt it 's been really reported on much . 
  so , news of that are practically nonexistent . 
  we 're too busy with local affairs ( aka the result of our elections ), 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastrami ) which we kinda borrowed from others too , because that 's how we rolled . 
  they are moldovan , so the status is rather ambiguous ... at least until the union , 
  they got one as well . 
  [ these guys are the ones i referred to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transsylvania_phoenix ), 
  i 'd just go along with it . 
  not that big of a deal , honestly . 
  hmm ... let 's see , who can i say is rather well-known . 
  pop : inna , alexandra stan , carla 's dreams rock : phoenix , pasarea colibri rap : b.u.g mafia , parazitii turbofolk , aka those who must not be named : sandu ciorba ( because of the 5 mil . 
  poles who saw the dalibomba vid ) , florin salam . 
  and , do n't really know of others . 
  feel free to add more in the replies . 
  only greeting the teacher as a group over here sometimes . 
  altough i kind of like the idea of a pledge of allegiance . 
  with europe : 4th movement of beethoven 's 9th symphony . 
  eu : bureaucracy and paper-pushers . 
  eh , too cold . 
  otherwise , neutral . 
  i personally got no problems regarding america . 
  i hope the best for trump and that he actually lives up to his task . 
  the election aside , love america . 
  wide open spaces all around , beautiful scenery , rather cheery and industrious folk , hospitable . 
  i may not be that big of a literature fan ( i prefer non-fiction , history books and so on ) , but i 'll probably give it to marin preda .
