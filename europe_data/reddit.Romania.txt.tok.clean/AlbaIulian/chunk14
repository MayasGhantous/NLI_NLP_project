  wrote one of the few school books i actually grew a liking to , altough i did grow bored and did not finish it . 
  yes , stop expanding , and probably begin to retreat as well . 
  yes . 
  too cold , too dreary , too much snow , too depressing . 
  i 'd have it so that summer is still hot and that in winter , temperatures never dip below 14 degrees . 
  worst-case scenario might be either the creation of the romanian ssr or a partition : ivan takes moldova and merges it into the moldovan ssr , leaves dobruja to the bulgarians , transylvania to the hungarians and wallachia becomes a puppet rump state . 
  [ 1940 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/p%c3%a9rdidasterritorialesrumanas1940-ro.svg/1280px-p%c3%a9rdidasterritorialesrumanas1940-ro.svg.png ) : the year when [ greater romania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/greaterromaniahistoricregions.png ) got ripped from us and we could not to anything . 
  been a while since i last measured , but i generally have no problem with my height . 
  we are formal over here : for teachers , it is domnule profesor , commonly shortened to dom . 
  profesor ( mr. teacher/professor or teacher ) , doamna profesoar\u0103 , usually shortened to doamna ( mrs. teacher/professor or mrs. ) . 
  * attempts to greet chinese tourists while raising right hand and speaking from behind a window , a perfectly square-shaped piece of dirt under my nose *, 
  yeah , and nobody over here really cares about that , and we got no autonomous industry . 
  so , yeah , old answer stands . 
  pizza and chicken schnitzel ( any other meat is heresy ) . 
  not a fan of greens . 
  [ `` ok , one last time . 
  these are small . 
  but the ones out there are far away . 
  small ... far away . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds12p0zqlt0 ), 
  they 're rare , but we got roadside crosses , which is related . 
  nothing . 
  comments on the other ones ? 
  also , if you are polish , can we into visegrad ? 
  indeed . 
  feels just odd to be in a big city , even if it 's only cluj napoca instead of london , or in the lowlands . 
  just feels ... off in my case . 
  i need the countryside to survive :p, 
  we got that here in transylvania as well . 
  eh , opposed to cannabis as a matter of principle , as i am to alcohol , tobacco and co. . would never willingly take such stuff , and i hope nobody else would want to , as well ... but unfortunately , the world is weird ... 
  of course that it does n't work when it 's under 33 % tax . 
  if cigs became overnight 41 e for a pack ... that would work better , hehe . 
  stuff like this is why i prefer rural areas and small towns to cities . 
  i love my home . 
  good old transylvania . 
  personally , opposed to practically all drugs , so i do n't really think of that in a positive way . 
  but if it is legal , then tax the hell out of it ( and alcohol and tobacco as well ) to keep people away , and continue the anti-drug campaign . 
  just because you can do something , does n't mean you have to do it , after all . 
  * home alone on protv every christmas . 
  * [ the battle of ruginoasa  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjg2nprtg2k ) every year , the villagers in 3 communes , most notably ruginoasa , iasi county , divide themselves into 2 groups : hill people ( deleni ) and valley people ( valeni ) . 
  these two groups put on heavy masks and , on the 31st of december , meet up at an established location to fight each other for the rights to organize festivities in the next year ( and implicitly for the girls , from what i gleam ) . 
  in recent years , police has been sent there to keep the two from actually fighting , unfortunately . 
  * bride stealing : at weddings , it 's become commonplace for some wedding guests to `` steal '' - take away - the bride to a place only they know - usually somewhere like a club or whatever , it 's their choice - , and then the groom has to `` negotiate '' with them her release . 
  from what i read , the bride 's shoe is brought to the groom as proof they have her , and after that the negotiations begin . 
  * [ the chicken dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsvs2p_x60q ) ... no comment on this one . 
  * fire jumping : on the day of st john 's birth ( sanzienele ) it 's apparently traditional to jump over a fire for some reason . 
  no idea about this one . 
  null-vote . 
  the current one , yes , altough if psd wins the next election , it 'd go back to no immediately . 
  - romania, 
  die wacht am rhein , panzer rollen in afrika vor , stefan hrusca and some national anthems . 
  with other stuff like sabaton or nightwish on the side . 
  very negative imo . 
  kaunas by far . 
  * fuego * puiu codreanu ( / s ) * parazitii and bug mafia * phoenix and pasarea colibri * pepe, 
  personally , i kinda celebrate it on the 24th : listening to hrusca and fuego , and probably stefan banica jr. are a must-do over here , and a big dinner takes place . 
  then the carolers arrive ( or not ) , then the day ends . 
  gifts arrive in the evening , usually . 
  buried in a mausoleum , preferrably located near my old haunts . 
  landscape , i 'd say netherlands . 
  too damn flat for my taste . 
  politically , i 'd probably say bulgaria . 
  with such characters as borisov , that puts even our worst exemplars to shame . 
  culturally ... hmm , no idea here . 
  do n't really like the netherlands , yet again . 
  too liberal for my taste . 
  `` i do not make word games / nor do i want to insult him / he is not too fast of mind / but he lies pretty damn much . '', 
  `` between you and old rembrandt / there is only one difference / he is the great fleming painter / you are just the starving painter '', 
  right now i am single , but i hope that i will marry one day . 
  i dislike it as a concept , but wo n't ban it . 
  instead , what should be done is instill good education so as to reduce the need for doing them in the first place . 
  probably slight paranoia on my behalf . 
  and i , as mentioned , do n't want to spend time abroad more than necessary and do n't really like travelling . 
  once done , i 'll return to romania and stay there . 
  gypsies migrated out of west india centuries ago , and have a largely negative reputation in romania due to a very large proportion of them being criminals . 
  as such , some internet romanians , probably of the dacopath type , say they should go back to india . 
  the way i see it is that europeans , especially in the west and in the north , are extremely smug about themselves . 
  they see the welfare state and scandinavia as a paradise and deride countries that , due to a different mentality or financial problems , do n't want to reach that ideal , as backwards . 
  personally i consider them to be at the crossroads between east and west , in a situation like cyprus , but more european than asian . 
  not really . 
  few trade schools , and high-schools are focused more on theoretical stuff . 
  urals -  ural river -  caspian sea -  caucasus mountains -  bosphorus + dardanelles + aegaean islands . 
  pretty similar to america . 
  that would create more problems than it 's worth ... 
  i know of a story about a farmer who ran a business selling pigs , ca n't really remember exact details . 
  i remember that he made a decent income , nothing was spoiled , everything went well until the eu came along . 
  with its bureaucracy , it proceeded to make it infinitely harder for the farmer to do his business , because it promotes big , monoculture farms instead of actual small farms . 
  hopefully not . 
  or even if , probably as a trade-only group or divided into more regional groups . 
  hopefully the recent events have shown the eucrats we do n't really want that . 
  if they do n't give up , we will just show them via elections again and again until their stubborn heads finally recognize the need to back down . 
  i 'm rather familiar with it , due to interest . 
  and i got no problem with it . 
  you guys run your country your way , we run it our own way . 
  yep . 
  united states of europe ... 
  wage ? 
  depends . 
  minimum wage is 217.50 euro per month ( 1250 lei ) , but as i said , it depends on the job . 
  * lay 's : around 3 lei for 1 normal-sized bag * chio : around 3 lei for 1 normal-sized bag * pringles : around 7 lei for 1 big can prices can vary according to variety and shop , and there are many other brands as well , but in principal , these are the big 3 chips over here .
