  starting variably from 3-4 , to 5 . 
  * scoala primara ( primary school ) . 
  classes 1-4 . 
  national evaluations at the end of 2nd and 4th grades , but i am not part of the state system , so i am not informed . 
  4th grade one kind of guides what middle-school you will go to . 
  ( middle/general school ) . 
  classes 5-8 . 
  exams at the end of 6th and 8th grades . 
  8th grade one is important because it acts as a high-school admittance exam ; the better your results , the better your high-school can be , or at least how i know it . 
  ( high-school . ), 
  classes 9-12 . 
  no 10th grade exams , but there 's the big bad bacalaureat ( baccalaureate , or the bac ) at the end of the 12th grade , which plenty of people dread . 
  * after the baccalaureate , you take the admittance exam ( admiterea ) for college , yet some unis dropped that as far as i know . 
  anybody can go , but exam result guides whether you go in the taxless bracket ( uni 's free , this is where the best ones go , but you have to work hard in order to stay here ) or in the tax bracket ( uni requires tuition ) . 
  duration depends on specialty , and bac grades influence your results . 
  * regarding trade schools , as far as i know high-school profile affects your career prospects , and there are a few specialized high-schools which offer trade programs , but if you become a tradesman , no uni for you , so for plenty of people , who already see these as a joke , going into a trade is n't too desirable , to say the least . 
  i got plenty ... but in spirit , they will always be age of empires iii , warcraft iii , and rise of nations . 
  ah yes , we got that too . 
  * a da bip * - literally , to beep . 
  only in official doccuments do i generally see this . 
  over there we also write our names surname-first `` franaru pulica '' instead of the usual name order `` pulica franaru '' . 
  it will become older and it will begin to decay . 
  romanian , english , german , italian , and russian . 
  romanian because it 's my mother language , english-world lingua franca german - it 's handy nowadays and it can be nice if done right . 
  italian - beautiful . 
  russian - influential in its own way , can sound wonderful if done right .

  for me , idk ... ca n't really decide between victor ponta , sebastian ghita , and liviu dragnea . 
  * ponta : worst pm we ever had ; we literally made history by having him the first pm who was prosecuted while in office , plagiarized , populist `` raise pensions '' and such shit just to get reelected while letting the country rot whilist not delivering it in the hands of the psd barons , attempted to obstruct justice . 
  * ghita : corrupt media mogul , in the pocket of the psd . 
  * dragnea : corrupt head of the psd . 
  known to be : corrupt , prosecuted for it yet refuse to leave office as psd president , raising the dead to vote in elections , trying to obstruct the dna 's proceedings , being a psd baron . 
  odd ; why do we need to halt imports so much ? 
  to over-generalize , beggars . 
  do n't really have any in my wallet . 
  still got the glorious 50 , 10 , 5 ban coins . 
  it is just perfect . 
  we got it : s\u0103tul / s\u0103turat . 
  dor : a special sense of longing , homesickness , and nostalgia , all rolled up into one . 
  similar , but different , to the saudade of portugal . 
  day after tomorrow : poim\u00e2ine day before yesterday : alalt\u0103ieri day after day after tomorrow : r\u0103spoim\u00e2ine . 
  i do agree , it does taste pretty good . 
  but each type of water is different in its own way . 
  aqua carpatica has a different taste than dorna , just like abendstaller is different from saskia . 
  but , in front of the queen of mineral waters , borsec , all pale , 
  we do , but us having them as prefixes/suffixes and our conjugations can lead to weird things if we learn german . 
  with pearls such as `` tragen '' for to bring instead of to wear , or , god forbid , sticking a '' - ieren '' on the end of words to make verbs `` plimbieren/gandieren/vorbieren instead of spazieren gehen/denken/sprechen '' . 
  not to mention the garbled grammar and such . 
  it 's ok , if i may say so . 
  altough i 'm a fan of the old guys over here , like parazitii and b.u.g , so idk much bout the newer ones . 
  what is it with germans and sparkling water ? 
  * complain about how the psd fucks the country over * eat mici * listen to at least 1 manea at some point in your life * eat seeds, 
  ah yes , the articles . 
  11-12 years of studying the language and i still ca n't wrap my head round those . 
  and i who was expecting that meiecundimees thing . 
  public care may be free as far as i know , but it 's shit . 
  people who can afford it tend to go to private clinics . 
  i do n't drink in general . 
  no idea on best beers and foreign beers , as i do n't drink . 
  but regarding most popular , timisoreana is very popular over here . 
  others : ursus , bergenbier , ciucas , ciuc , silva , noroc and golden brau . 
  * d\u0103 cu b\u00e2ta-n balt\u0103 * - he strikes the puddle with a stick , a.k.a a fail . 
  * buturuga mic\u0103 r\u0103stoarn\u0103 calul mare * - the small stump overthrows the big cart - the underdog can always win , or sort of .

  or do n't take care when a `` car-washing '' or so gypsy comes up . 
  no bloody idea . 
  oh yes . 
  a palace , even . 
  aka where most of the money they steal goes to . 
  we use some of the english ones ( lol being the most proeminent ) , but our native ones go like this : * plm : pula mea . 
  literally : `` my dick '' . 
  usually mean `` whatever '' *  ) ) ) ) : laughter . 
  used in place of xd or lmao . 
  add as many brackets as you like . 
  literally : `` fuck your mother 's dead relatives '' , it means a stronger form of `` fuck you '' . 
  ( what can you do ? 
  nothing ya can do ) . 
  again , it 's a whatever . 
  ( the dick ) . 
  one of the most versatile and used words in the romanian language . 
  can be used for a variety of needs .
