  * dreq : dracu ' ( the devil ) . 
  usually accompanied by `` futa-te '' ( may ... fuck you ) . 
  that 's all those that come to mind atm . 
  one about vaslui : * a man from vaslui is acclaimed as a genius after discovering that the belt can be used to hold up your pants as well , alongside its old use of beating your wife * another one , from u/grgc : * how you become a man in vaslui : sow a tree , enter a coma after drinking mona - rubbing alcohol - , rape a underage girl/old lady , then rip off the tree you sowed before to pick a fight with another vaslui man *, 
  and that 's only the tip of the vaslui iceberg . 
  same over here . 
  nobody likes bucharest ( `` mitici '' ) and bucharest likes nobody ( `` provinciali '' ), 
  even if fictional , is it usually in emsland ? 
  according to my old german teacher ( and current gym teacher ) , it 's the center of the universe . 
  those hessians :p, 
  [ sorry ] ( http://www.sereniti.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/vaslui-criminalitate-topor-politie.jpg ) . 
  have a rakia with these [ 2 lovely chaps ] ( http://www.clubulderas.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11390119_10204105177.jpg ) . 
   las 3000 viviendas  gypsy majority that explains a lot . 
  clearly needs more of [ these ] ( http://www.campia-express.ro/images/stiri_2011/international/palate_tiganesti_campia_turzii.jpg ) but regarding bad ` hoods , ferentari takes the cake in bucharest . 
  [ meanwhile in vaslui ] ( http://www.viorelilisoi.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dsc_0249.jpg ), 
  sounds similar to what stereotypical bucharesters think of the non-bucharest areas . 
  fish ? 
  pff . 
  at least they do n't drink rubbing alcohol and carry axes everywhere . 
  do they ? 
  a few dumpsters around town , usually 1 or 2 per neighborhood or so . 
  theoretically there 's a distinction made between them , in practice , everyone throws their stuff in whichever one they want . 
  romanian 2 . 
  patriot 3 . 
  conservative 5 . 
  i went to a private german school , yet i know enough about the state schools so as to gauge their effectiveness , which is : not that good . 
  as with the spanish system , we have to memorize a lot like parrots . 
  some teachers may make it a bit more interesting and allow us some leeway into memorizing it , in order to understand it better . 
  yet , at exams , you have to adopt wooden-language and use fanciful expressions in order to pass . 
  deviating from the dogma is penalized instead of being taken into consideration as another interpretation . 
  ( at least in romanian class , the worst offender ) . 
  and after that , you do n't really remain with anything . 
  very helpful considering the exams at the end of the 4th , te 6th and the 8th grades , the baccalaureate simulations at the middle of the 11th and 12th grades , and the baccalaureate itself at the end of the 12th . 
  the system shoots itself in the foot . 
  ah yes . 
  our favorite funny-accented , spirt-drinking , caruta-driving , axe-wielding neighbors :p, 
  popular consensus is that the beaches are better in bulgaria . 
  cleaner . 
  we do have good beaches over here as well , but the cultural cringe just has to act up . 
  one more thing : forgot something bout the bulgarians in the first post : they 're beach and vehicle-registration-country . 
  a lot of romanians go to bulgaria on vacation , ostensibly due to the beaches , but more do probably because of the sales . 
   all inclusive ; la bulgari-at the bulgarians - all inclusive ~ polanball also , vehicles : some romanians cross the border to bulgaria in order to register their cars there so as to not pay some taxes . 
  it became something of a fad as well . 
  hmm . 
  somalians ( or some africans in general , yet i mostly hear about them for some reason ) are seen as weak , due to starvation , with dark jokes like '' * - where is the highest population density in somalia ? 
  - in whichever direction the wind 's beating at the moment * '' the chinese are seen as being industrious , and very used to having a large population . 
  '' * a chinese in a romanian taxi : - what 's your country 's population ? 
  - around 20 million . 
  - oh great , then you all know each other !, 
  they also are seen as liking rice and nuclear bombs . 
  '' * a chinese eats rice on a nuclear bomb/un chinez m\u0103n\u00e2nc\u0103 orez pe-o bomb\u0103 nuclear\u0103 * '' americans are seen as liking guns and cars a lot , yet they are good chaps . 
  indians : what plenty of people know about india over here is the reverence of their sacred cows . 
  turks : stubborn , hardheaded , and hotheaded . 
  usually if someone over here calls you a turk , they call you hardheaded - usually after asking you for something a few times with no answer - . 
  over here , we also have a saying '' * cum e turcul , si pistolul/like the turk , so is the pistol * '' . 
  arabs : rich , slightly ingnorant sometimes , yet they know how to have a good time . 
  they also like to come here to study medicine . 
  we also have a thing for morocco for some reason , as , stereotypically , whenever an arab is mentioned and he 's not an oil sheikh from the peninsula , it 's usually a moroccan . 
  they 're seen as big partiers . 
  armenians and jews : there is some overlap here : both can be rather stingy , and very business-savvy . 
  yep . 
  being caught in the middle of the turk-austrian-russian power struggle for a few centuries can do that :p . 
  wan na know some other stereotypes we got ? 
  ( be they national or regional ), 
  hungarians ca n't speak proper romanian , always want either autonomy or transylvania . 
  are funny to be around , yet are rather hotblooded and somewhat native . 
  russians are stubborn , like vodka a lot , enjoy life ( aka are womanizers and enjoy parties ) , and are brave . 
  bulgarians : they like cucumbers a lot serbians : i do n't hear much regarding serbian stereotypes . 
  ukrainians : likewise ; probably conflated with russians . 
  crossing the border is like always : they check your passport and not much else if you do it in your car , yet queues can be very long , and for buses it is hell , unless the drivers give out some bribes . 
  as we 're not part of schengen , it has not affected us at all . 
  we have 1 , and only one official language : romanian . 
  altough , de facto , hungarian is also used in some areas ( mostly szeklerland ) . 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
  yes . 
  one god , three persons : the father , son , and holy ghost . 
   are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
  baptized romanian orthodox . 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  yes , if i need guidance , or help , or solace every once in a while , or if i want to thank god for the good luck , fortune , and just general wellbeing in my life . 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... 
  i perceive myself as a believer . 
  i believe in the tenets of my faith , despite not quite adhering to some of them . 
   what is your general perception of religion ? 
  generally , i see religion as a good thing in principle , as it gives you a greater purpose , a sense of belonging , and a moral code on which to model your system of beliefs on , yet , as with almost anything that man gets their hands upon , it can be , and has been , manipulated into a weapon.tldr : good thing in principle , implemented shoddily . 
  i also see god as a permanent pillar , as he is always there to fall back on . 
  as such , if i ever feel sad or down , i can meditate or pray , to seek his solace . 
  it relaxes me to know that he 's there if i need him , and that he 's always gon na be with me . 
  oh yes . 
  pula , pizda , and futai are some of the most used words in our language xd . 
  x = na\u0219a fiului ( sons godmother ) y = tat\u0103l finei ( goddaughters father ) z = na\u0219i ( godparents ) so , godparents are na\u0219i , and godsons are fini . 
  how is it shitty ? 
  it 's perfect . 
  we 're so chill we do n't even take death seriously in some cases . 
  either we make merry cemeteries , or we just are raised back by liviu dragnea to vote in elections . 
  i 'd go with parazitii : [ parol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhqwrj_qlb8 ) [ tot ce-i bun trebuie sa dispara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toud_aqo-to ) [ exprimare libera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m5bmrjzhug ) [ jos cenzura ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2t2erwajck ) phoenix : [ in umbra marelui urss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adro9oumolc ) pasarea colibri : [ vinovatii fara vina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxqub-uq-ne ) [ pisica neagra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn9fvqtylmi ) among others .
