  that would be fun . 
  country : life imprisonment . 
  defence of my country , or national unification . 
  biggest cons : psd and liviu dragnea . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_romania ) my experience was different however . 
  * alba iulia 's my hometown , as such i am an alba iulian . 
  because i could n't really think of any other cool name , i just decided on this one . 
  * well , i am romanian and identify strongly with romania , my home . 
  no , we are just too different for any superstate to be feasible . 
  regional groupings ... probably ( in the vein of visegrad rather than old eu ) , but anything more ca n't really work . 
  hmm . 
  if i had to choose only between these two , i 'd choose ... iceland . 
  somewhat less alien language , volcano . 
  only thing that made me think of finland would be the lower latitude and the slightly warmer climate . 
  in slavic languages , generally the word druzhba denotes friendship or is associated with that . 
  in romanian , druzhba ( drujba or drujb\u0103 , as it is written here ) , means chainsaw . 
  i 'd march out in protest and start gathering support for secession . 
  civitas evolved into cetate over here , which means citadel . 
  the word for city is ora\u0219 . 
   at what times do you eat not fixed , may vary . 
   how many meals are there typically ? 
  again , for me it depends on the day . 
  usually around 1 big one ( around lunch ) and a few smaller ones . 
   which meals are the biggest/smallest/considered the most important probably lunch would be the most important or biggest one . 
   is fast food big in your country ? 
  i 'd say so . 
  pastries , local pretzels and shaorma 's are popular over here . 
   how often do people go to restaurants ? 
  no idea tbh how much do some people go . 
  i can afford to dine out a bit more , so i may not be the best guy to ask . 
  * political scandals . 
  lots of political scandals . 
  * latest murders or ugly deaths * some festivals or recent events * terror attacks when they occur * some study or some presumed new `` discoveries '' * statistics about prices or what romanians are buying or whatever . 
  less rigged would be a start . 
  and that is the name of [ a football player ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciprian_marica ) over here , doubly-hilarious . 
  romanian : * frate * boss ( said in the romanian way ) * man ( said in the romanian way ) * b\u0103 * f\u0103 ( usually used in the south ) round ii : * mi\u0219to * fain * super * cool * \u0218ucar ( used rarely , among certain segments of the population , rare otherwise ), 
  george soros , foreign interests , multinationals . 
  psd and some nutjobs mostly use these , and any others probably are rather rare . 
  mostly the latter , he is seen as being harsh but fair . 
  people like to compare his time , where nobody dared to steal a cup near a fountain as the saying goes , with the present time . 
  i like it . 
  wonderful country that 's screwed up by a few people in power . 
  aside from that , it has a lot of potential , and it 's done a lot to try and valorify it ... but a bit more can always be done . 
  manele , anyone ? 
  or if you 're not the type , well there 's gems like this  between us , there 's a storm once again  devastating all just like a hurricane  we keep lying , like at the meteo  it may be sunny , but i do n't see it ooh ( obviously it 's ca la meteo ), 
  most known example would be the \u00e2 vs \u00ee debate . 
  both are used to write the same sound , but their usage proved contentious . 
  initially we wrote \u00e2 in the middle of words and \u00ee at the beginning and the end of them . 
  the communists then banned \u00e2 , and wrote only with \u00ee ( except the country name and its derivates ) , and we reverted to the old style after we got rid of them . 
  examples here are mostly cherrypicked from the 1923 constitution * \u0102 at the end of some words became e ( origin\u0103-origine ) * i at the end of some words became e ( cari-care ) * e at the end of some words became ie ( constitue-constituie ) * ei at the end of some words became ii ( ordinei-ordinii ) * - \u021biune became - \u021bie ( constitu\u021biune-constitu\u021bie , condi\u021biune-condi\u021bie ) * stradelor-str\u0103zilor vocabulary , plenty of newer latin borrowings replaced older native or slavic words , or at the least coexist with them . 
  both mean friend , and both are used , albeit with slightly different meanings . 
  prieten would mean a closer friend . 
  * neat\u00e2rnat ( unhanged , native ) and slobod ( free , slavonic ) were replaced with liber or independent ( free and indpeendent ) and some differences in pronunciation as well . 
  there are few differences between caragiale 's romanian and today 's romanian . 
  ( but enough to cause a few giggles when the former is heard ), 
  i find it a bit ridiculous . 
  well , universities here are usually either apolitical or just toe the current government line ( do n't speak negatively of it ) . 
  over here , the notion of political universities baffles people . 
  the students , however ... vary . 
  most generally either want no corruption or just want to breeze through the thing to get a diploma for bragging rights . 
  you do n't really hear about student organizations here . 
  hmm ... opportunity to propagate the right ... 
  i refuse to identify with it . 
  good in some private situations , or if you are going to the pool , horrible otherwise . 
  not really . 
  only aspects it is close are n't related to the government . 
  i 'd like : no crooks in government , a booming economy , but i 'd also like mantaining our own currency and border controls . 
  and a stronger and clean conservative party . 
  ** armenia ** * had its own kingdom since antiquity . 
  [ tigranes the great took it to its greatest extent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/armenian_empire.png ) * indo-european peoples , distantly related to the greeks . 
  * language has a distinct alphabet , attributed to meshrop mashtots . 
  * first country to adopt christianity as the state religion , around the 300 's . 
  still follow a brand of christianity distinct from their neighbors ( miaphysite if i remember , led by the catholicos ) * after the ancient kingdom was ended , spent much of its time under foreign rule ; first divided between byzantines and persians , then conquered by the arabs , then they had their own kingdom for a time under the bagratuni 's , then they got conquered by the byzantines again , then by the turks , then part of it was conquered by the persians and later on the russians . 
  * follow-up : language reflects its division : the western armenian dialect is distinct to this day from the eastern armenian one , reflecting the divisions . 
  * an extremely large diaspora , present over here as well ; the towns of gherla and dumbraveni were founded by armenian settlers . 
  * romania and armenia have a good relationship ; romania was the first country to recognize armenia 's independence and offer asylum to the refugees of the genocide . 
  * the armenian genocide . 
  * capital : yerevan . 
  mountainous , revere mount ararat . 
  * are n't too big fans of turkey and azerbaijan . 
  * they fought with azerbaijan over artsakh/karabakh . 
  * relatively poor and suffered much , but very resilient . 
  * they are members of csto if i remember , as a safeguard against their hostile neighbors . 
  * a lot of their names end in - ian or - yan . 
  example : sargsyan , khachaturian , vosganian * home of apricots ** georgia ** * language is distinct from pretty much all of their neighbors ; alphabet as well . 
  latter evolved into three phases : asomtavruli , nuskhuri , mkhedruli , if i remember . 
  * had their own kingdom in the middle ages , with tamar the great being one of its greatest rulers . 
  eventually it had to split into kartli , kakheti and imereti , with the first two reunifying into kartli-kakheti eventually . 
  all were conquered by russia eventually . 
  * persians had some georgian administrators . 
  * their royal house , the bagrationi dynasty , is one of the oldest extant christian ruling houses . 
  * capital is tbilisi , also known as tiflis under an old romanization . 
  * stalin was born in gori * do n't have a good relationship with russia due to the russo-georgian war , and their propping up of abkhazia and south ossetia . 
  * names end in - adze or - shvili a lot ; shevardnadze , saakashvili ... * they are orthodox , unlike their armenian and azerbaijani neighbors . 
  * used to be known as caucasian iberia . 
  ** azerbaijan ** * area used to be known as caucasian albania , and was inhabited by a people unrelated to the illyrian albanians . 
  * actually comprises only part of the azeri-inhabited region ; most azeris actually live in iran . 
  * they have oil reserves , making them rather important to say the least . 
  * they hosted eurovision in 2012 . 
  * do n't get along too well with armenia .
