  i hope so . 
  yep , this should speak volumes . 
  of course that iliescu would kick him out again in the 90 's while michael was at the curtea de arges monastery . 
  he felt threatened . 
  our own . 
  king seems like a nice guy , and it would be a neat way to repay him after the shit we put him through after wwii . 
  marry : moldova . 
  1918 borders never forget . 
  kill : ukraine/hungary . 
  practically nothing , and i 'm looking forward for some peace and quiet after i 'm done with the baccalaureate . 
  i kinda like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/naval_flag_of_the_kingdom_of_france_%28civil_ensign%29.svg/1200px-naval_flag_of_the_kingdom_of_france_%28civil_ensign%29.svg.png ) and [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/royal_standard_of_the_king_of_france.svg/1200px-royal_standard_of_the_king_of_france.svg.png ) . 
  you can guess why :p, 
  1 : non-desirable . 
  i 'd get fed up and leave 2 . 
  fine for me . 
  not much . 
  not many decent stations around . 
  antena 3 and rtv are psd propaganda machines , protv is fine , digi likewise , antena 1 may have a slight bias , and not sure if b1 , realitatea and tvr are relevant anymore . 
  asa ii ok . we just like it when people know we exist . 
  ok . then not a fan of that either :p, 
  i do n't mind . 
  we 've got our own little corner of the world , nobody disturbs it , and we like it this way . 
  ( even though it could use some enlarging . ), 
  not really to be totally honest . 
  we 're that irrelevant , we stopped giving a damn . 
  then , what did you mean exactly . 
  camping out , going to foreign countries ? 
  what , not all of us are europhiles . 
  in my area , plenty of young people like myself lean towards euroscepticism . 
  what 's there to say ? 
  there has to be a dissenter . 
  [ of ] ( http://alba24.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/p1296402.jpg ) [ course ] ( http://artifexlohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dscn8682-1-1024x822.jpg ), 
  divest more of its own sovereignity towards the states . 
  no , never felt the need to . 
  only instance would be some school-related trip to austria , which i do n't look upon with kind eyes . 
  traveling does n't interest me anyway , i prefer to remain within my own country 's borders . 
  some , because i could n't decide : the only way i would accept an united europe would be if the roman empire was still around and spanned the entire continent . 
  otherwise , federalization is a no-no . 
  absolute enlightened hierarchical despotism  democracy . 
  constitutional monarchies , or just monarchies in general , are better than republics . 
  autarky is the ideal all humans and countries should strive for , and the ideal state would interfere as less as possible within the citizens ' lives . 
  marx and the french revolutions were mistakes of history . 
  only a select few actually have the capability to go to college ; not everyone is suited for it . 
  the artist , the humanist and the poet is more important than the scientist , the it-ist and the mathematician . 
  civilized societies need to be hierarchized . 
  there . 
  it 's not used in my area . 
  * para ; parale * - turkish loanword for money . 
  * lovea ; lovele * - not sure if there is a translation . 
  * malai * - corn dough * bistari * - no idea , perhaps comes from turkish * galbeni * - yellows , nobody really uses this anymore . 
  * coco * - cocoa , used around cluj , northwards of my area . 
  checked in , wrote answer as well . 
  luni : monday . 
  day of the moon . 
  marti : tuesday . 
  day of mars . 
  miercuri : wednesday . 
  day of mercury . 
  joi : thursday . 
  day of jove/jupiter . 
  vineri : friday . 
  day of venera/venus . 
  sambata : saturday . 
  lords ' day . 
  again , pretty much all come from latin , so ... yeah . 
  america is one of the most beautiful countries on this planet , and i just love you guys . 
  tastiest : shaorma ( kebab ) if you get it in the right places , pretzels . 
  worst : badly-made kebab . 
  we 're big kebab fans to say the least . 
  yep . 
  a place to my liking like no others . 
  i 'd even have no problem if the borders were closed :p, 
  let 's see ... 1 . 
  my hometown , obviously . 
  do n't want to leave my native soil . 
  2 and 3 . 
  ... ok , ran out of ideas . 
  ca n't imagine living away from my beloved homeland , especially if it 's above a line going from bordeaux through the alps , carpathians and dnieper river up to the urals . 
  foreign and northerly areas are anathema for me . 
  for us , not at all . 
  yes , i 'm a deist . 
  no bloody idea . 
  mostly drink bottled anyway . 
  not really . 
  we 're usually rather suspicious of such things over here . 
  perhaps constantine xi for the king-in-the-mountain aspect . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/coat_of_arms_of_romania_%281992-2016%29.svg/671px-coat_of_arms_of_romania_%281992-2016%29.svg.png ) is the one i knew most of my life ; eagle comes from rome , cross , rather obvious , and within the shield on the eagle are the coats of arms of the 5 `` provinces '' : clockwise from top left : wallachia , moldova , transylvania , dobruja , banat . 
  now , they decided to [ recoronate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg/671px-coat_of_arms_of_romania.svg.png ) the eagle with the old iron crown of romania . 
  personally , i miss our [ royal ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/kingdom_of_romania_-_big_coa.svg/3000px-kingdom_of_romania_-_big_coa.svg.png ) [ coats of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/kingdom_of_romania_-_medium_coa.svg/2200px-kingdom_of_romania_-_medium_coa.svg.png ) , altough not a fan of [ the old eagle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/kingdom_of_romania_-_small_coa.svg/950px-kingdom_of_romania_-_small_coa.svg.png ) . 
  combine the modern eagle with the old design , bring back the monarchy and we 're set . 
  only time it worked was when it came from the other side, 
  well , somebody did try out that adage once . 
  did n't turn out too well . 
  traditionally gymnastics was our strong suit , but olympics have rather fallen in popularity over here a lot . 
  i do n't really have a favorite , do n't like to watch the olympics . 
  they 're just boring for me . 
  sometimes the goat comes on christmas , as it did over here a few times . 
  of course , i am a nationalist ( pan-romanian ) myself and i am young . 
  i love my country , it is very beautiful , however , it is tarnished by the crooks who hold the power at the moment . 
  i want to fix that , eventually .
