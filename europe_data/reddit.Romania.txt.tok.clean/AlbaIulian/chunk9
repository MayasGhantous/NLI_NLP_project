  not for nothing do we usually call it barbecue day :p, 
  well , we only know of one of them ( the one who wrote the three musketeers ) , so this is a non-issue . 
  itt : not really . 
  ideally we should : high school for more theoretical fare and trade schools for practical work . 
  however , the latter were closed down for the most part and now everyone tries to get a hs diploma just to have one . 
  not a good idea . 
  does n't seem too trustworthy to me . 
  inefficient mess that to me has overstepped its bounds . 
  i 'd generaly prefer either a simple trade deal or a thoroughly defanged brussel-equivalent . 
  and , as a question , what would you like the eu to be . 
  usually the elderly , poor and some rural youth vote social-democratic ( read : mafia ) , the young do not really vote , the middle-class vote national-liberal most of the time , the politically active youth and those seeking an alternative vote usr . 
  hungarians vote their own party , and the wealthy ... not sure . 
  but generally the trend is political apathy . 
  `` no matter how i vote it 's the same guys always coming to power '', 
  i pretty much do n't give a damn . 
  after some hesitation and tinkering from the initial ones , in fear of being perceived as too hardline , got [ this ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/02e36a4cc2798a81020bef7675765215.png ), 
  tbh i 'm afraid of sharing my results here . 
  to a degree , i am . 
  i always found older stuff more aesthetically pleasing than newer architecture . 
  i wish that neo-classicism returned to the forefront , or neo-byzantine architecture . 
  either the school uniform ( a gray suit and my choice of dress shirt , usually white or blue , sometimes black ) or a plaid jacket , a plain t-shirt and some jean-like pants . 
  chicken schnitzel or pizza . 
  beverages : water . 
  misplacing stuff , or bicyclists sometimes 4 . 
  daydreaming ; generally a bit happy . 
  uhh ... reply hazy , do n't know the answer right now . 
  forgetting to take my hand off the doorknob when leaving and slamming the door shut by mistake . 
  and when somebody argues loudly or acts disruptive , that is \u021big\u0103nie . 
  ( like a gypsy ), 
  universal healthcare ? 
  no idea , kind of . 
  single payer ? 
  costs ? 
  no idea personally , never had to look into it too much . 
  like ? 
  not much , there 's that eastern european fear of doctors acting up . 
  plenty . 
  doctor shortage ? 
  yes . 
  * glares at western europe * funding ? 
  no , it 's lacking . 
  * do n't remember if the indus valley is mentioned * early center of civilization and mathematics * alexander the great reached india * columbus wanted to find india , found the americas . 
  * da gama reached india by circumnavigating the cape of good hope * brits held india as a colony ... perhaps something about india gaining independence . 
  very rarely . 
  you said `` not just as single song '' , so the majority of what i could 've said went out the window :p . aside from that ... only sabaton would count i guess , as i doubt it that national anthems or military marches count . 
  hmm ... 
  oldest we talk about but we do n't study in-depth would be the chronicles of ureche , costin and neculce , around 1640 's . 
  oldest studied text would be alexandru lapusneanu , published in 1840 , about the second reign of the voivode alexandru lapusneanu - memorable because of the pyramid of heads within . 
  roma invicta , of course . 
  no idea tbh . 
  i mostly prefer cash anyway . 
  no idea about tarom , never flew with them . 
  even then , i travel very rarely . 
  well , have n't really seen pasca in my area  ), 
  total war series and the paradox gsg 's ( crusader kings 2 , europa universalis iii and iv , victoria 2 , and hearts of iron 3 and 4-personally prefer 4 - ) , i guess . 
  oh yes , curentul/promaja . 
  and i who thought it was mostly a balkan thing . 
  and god forbid you leave a window and a door open at the same time . 
  knocking eggs of course  ), 
  * do you celebrate it yes , we do . 
  * what days are off sunday ( 16 april ) and monday ( 17 april ) . 
  establishments usually publish a special program around this time , usually to indicate earlier closings or so . 
  * what are the traditions in your country/region/home . 
  well , on saturday around midnight people go to church with candles lit from a holy light , specially brought from jerusalem . 
  then if space permits , they surround the church with the candles about 2 or 3 times . 
  there 's also the painted egg tradition ; people greet each other with the greeting `` cristos a \u00eenviat ! '', 
  ( christ is risen !, 
  ) , the answer being `` adev\u0103rat a \u00eenviat '' ( indeed risen ! ), 
  and then knock the eggs together . 
  whose egg 's shell cracks loses . 
  there is also the `` udat '' tradition ; girls , unmarried or married are sprinkled with perfume , so that they 'll be beautiful the whole year , have strong kids and smell like spring the whole year . 
  they get their revenge on the third day of easter though . 
  the traditional meal on easter sunday is generally drob de miel , a lamb haggis i never liked personally . 
  there are also plenty of different traditions which i will not enumerate right now , due to tiredness . 
  * how are the days called in your language the days of the holy week , starting from the saturday before it ( cuz tradition ) holy week : s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na mare ( great week ) or s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na patimilor ( passion week ) lazarus saturday : s\u00e2mb\u0103ta lui laz\u0103r palm sunday : floriile holy monday : lunea mare ( grand monday , not really used ) holy tuesday : mar\u021bea mare ( grand tuesday , not really used ) holy wednesday : miercurea mare ( grand wednesday , not really used ) holy thursday : joia mare/joia verde ( grand thursday/green thursday ) good friday : vinerea mare/vinerea seac\u0103 / vinerea neagr\u0103 ( grand friday/dry friday/black friday ) holy saturday : s\u00e2mb\u0103ta mare ( grand saturday ) easter sunday : duminica pa\u0219telui easter monday : lunea pa\u0219telui / a doua zi de pa\u0219ti / lunea luminat\u0103 ( second day of easter/bright monday ) now , personally , i 'm not that religious but i still do celebrate it in some way . 
  knocking eggs is always fun for me . 
  i 'll stop here but if you got questions , feel free to answer . 
  there will always be a need for maintenance . 
  human labor will always be needed imho . 
  not to mention that human craftsmanship may be held in higher regard than robot labor ; artisans or human-run factories may bloom . 
  no , because i 'd stand to lose instead of gaining from communism . 
  there will always be a need for maintenance for those robots . 
  and who 's to say that old-style production would disappear ? 
  perhaps new human-staffed factories or craftsman shops would spring up , and the `` made by humans '' label could denote something of higher quality than mass-produced robot-made stuff . 
  it 's more common over here tho . 
  the [ square piece of dirt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x70bndpc70 ) from that same episode was equally hilarious . 
  both of them are considered democratic socialist . 
  sinn fein 's programme has items generally considered to be left-wing : * cap on public sector pay three times the average workers ' wage , * greater investment for the disabled , * greater state investment in the economy , * support for palestine , * support for the public sector of healthcare * support for same-sex marriage inc advocates for a form of civic nationalism based on equal rights , tolerance , freedom and equality . 
  it also supports a mixed economy , a form of affirmative action ( to be fair , one which is criticized ) , expansion of public healthcare and investment in public education . 
  indian national congress . 
  my country : that we cast off the shackles of communism in '89 and are working to remove the last remnants of it today . 
  europe : that the continent used to be the hegemon of the world . 
  it 's not , and it sounds rather weird to me . 
  what were we thinking with this combination . 
  yep . 
  what were we thinking . 
  not to mention that nationalism does n't necessarily mean far-right ; there are prominent examples of left-wing nationalism as well . 
  agreed on the hivemind part . 
  * former premier victor ponta ended up with the nickname `` mickey mouse '' due to [ this photo ] ( https://media.dcnews.ro/image/201411/w670/victor_ponta_1_68886200.jpg ) * former justice minister florin iordache got stuck with the `` alta intrebare '' ( another question/next question ) meme after he used that phrase about 24 times within a press conference during the oug 13 brouhaha . 
  * former nationalist politician corneliu vadim tudor became a goldmine due to his very angry outbursts of rage .
