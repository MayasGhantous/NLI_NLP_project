   how exactly would that happen ? 
  do you think putin stands to win an engagement with conventional forces ? 
  i do n't know but i know who will lose , everyone . 
  i do n't think anyone would be stupid to get the whole world blown . 
  ukraine 's current leadership 's ideals/dreams is not worth the death of hundred of thousand or even millions european , russian or americans . 
  it 's something we can simply not gamble or bluff . 
  so you 're saying that we should draw a red line over something ? 
  if it gets broken then what ? 
  how about russia 's red line , should we ignore it ? 
  i mean they stated many times and were very explicit that trying to get ukraine into nato and foreign involvement in ukraine is a red line , we ca n't say whatever happened after maidan took us by surprise . 
  my question is , what do we if red line meets red line ? 
  start a war with russia ? 
  destroy europe and maybe the whole world for the sake of having ukraine in the western sphere of influence ? 
   most of the people in the east want nothing more than to live in peace . 
  i think people everywhere want to live in peace . 
   increase the cost for russian intervention in ukraine until it becomes unfeasible for putin to be there . 
  and we ca n't increase that without worsening the situation . 
  i do n't think russia will quit until they no longer feel threatened , maybe until they can be sure ukraine does n't join nato or ignore moscow . 
  so far we have a couple of solutions to solve that mess : 1 . 
  federalization of ukraine . 
  not sure if it would fully solve it , but russia seemed interested in it . 
  negotiate with russia so that ukraine can join/follow eu in exchange of a non-nato entry . 
  i think they fear more nato entry than eu . 
  give russia something in exchange for giving up ukraine while assuring russians of ukraine will not have their rights stomped . 
  you 're making it sound like it 's something easy that can be solved . 
  in reality there is a very complex problem which can not be solved , as there is no real target . 
  what would the desired outcome of the situation be ? 
  because i feel like everyone who wants us to interfere more is just idealistic and lacks a sense of reality . 
  ukraine is a torn country with most of its problem being internal rather than external , they are nowhere in shape to join eu ( hell , they are even worse than romania when we joined and everyone got upset about it ) so that 's at least a decade away , crimea 's not going back to ukraine regardless of what eu does , and there is still a huge pro-russian population in ukraine and again it 's nothing eu can do about it . 
  so i have no idea what the people who keep yelling that germany/eu does nothing expect us to do . 
  expect us to sacrifice our own economies to sustain the ukrainian economy ? 
  with out huge internal problems ( greece ? 
  spain ? 
  italy ? 
  ) , we have so many problems to overcome inside of eu that we ca n't afford to focus anywhere else . 
  the ideals of eu is to become a community , a common economy , integration of countries and evolution and eu is doing great , countries are getting more integrated , it avoids war ( and when i mean that just look at the history of the last two centuries , do n't just give me ukraine or yugoslavia ) in europe and that 's amazing . 
  ukraine needs to sort itself out , it 's not us that can do it , it 's something they need to , they have expectations that are not on par with reality , some of them are really idealistic and just thought that they 'll join the eu and become another germany , they have n't even come to terms about their own differences . 
  germany 's the engine of the eu and they main force behind it , whether we like it or not , they do have a bigger say in its affairs than anyone else and has a bigger responsibility than anyone else , for example see the economical crisis and problems of eu states . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that it 's completely normal and expect-able that they put their self interest and eu 's interest before other things . 
  i know there 's a lot of hate for germany because they act like they own the eu at times , but we should face the truth . 
  it 's dumb to assume germany 's afraid of anyone . 
  they are n't , they have reached a certain point of wisdom ( they are n't doing great because they are stupid ) where they have learned to think on a long term . 
  their politic and external politic is very good and helpful for both germany and the eu , they manage to keep good contacts around the world which is extremely important . 
  for example , as far as russia , germany 's one of the few countries that are seen as valuable partners . 
  true , but it 's not like this is in any way relevant since in the eastern block you never had to worry about paying off your house or finding a workplace . 
  there was a pretty much permanent state of war with brief pauses when they managed to kill our leaders and put their own for a few years until he suffered the same fate and repeat . 
  that 's pretty common everywhere i think . 
  we romanians like to bash our country like no other , but the moment a foreigner does it ... it 's war !, 
  that 's icao regulations , means they are for the civil aviation , they do not apply to military aircraft . 
  the military communication channels are agreed by more parties . 
  because if turkey did warn but on a different channel than the one agree , it 's meaningless . 
  i saw it from bucharest that night , around 00:15 local time . 
  it was a pretty big flash , i was somewhat upset that no one else seemed to have seen it . 
  terrorists like that do n't have heavier anti-air systems . 
  what happened with mh17 is not plausible here , a buk was there to ensure the ukrainian af does n't bomb the rebels , and the passenger plane was confused with a fighter or a bomber . 
  that 's incredibly ignorant of you . 
  trains are awesome means of transport and have been , especially back before ' 89 , widely used by all categories of population . 
  in fact they are still widely used today , and from the numbers looks like rail traffic is making a small comeback . 
  though keep in mind there 's different classes of trains , with some ( regio - local trains ) being the ones used by commuters and all images provided are from such train ( cheapest trains ) . 
  that looks amazing , it 's really sad they will destroy it , even if it 's only 150 years old . 
  i remember playing that game when i was a kid . 
  let 's review this discussion , i think we 're missing . 
  you are saying that war memorial tanks ( unused tanks ) need ** significant ** maintenance and repairing before you can get them to work . 
  i 'm saying that you do n't , since even taking tanks from swamps were made to work with ** insignificant ** maintenance . 
  to sustain , i 've mentioned all those cases , and i 've even found the videos for the su-152 which was taken out of a forest pond ( if i remember correctly ) and some mechanics made it work in the same day : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aker9iwkjke so if abandoned tanks like that can be made to work on its own without ** significant ** maintenance then obviously war memorial or museum tanks can also . 
  and let 's clarify , significant means a lot of work , i view that as in weeks of maintenance , eventually changing a lot of its original parts . 
  insignificant for me means that it takes maximum a couple of days and keeps 90 % of its original parts . 
  why is that ? 
  that 's what they all do , they are masters of spinning shit around until it gets in a favorable position . 
  i never said you just walk out with them off memorials , i mentioned they are very sturdy and very simple , thus easy to make them function . 
  i do n't understand what you 're arguing here about , you just keep mentioning they need significant maintenance to make them work while just youtubing tanks being taken out of swamps and lakes , then someone with good knowledge of tank 's systems does a couple of hours of work and they get it to start . 
  another thing to note is that all russian tanks , especially the t-34 , were built very simple and to use common parts of vehicles like tractors or trucks . 
  you can see videos with russians that use t55s to plough their land , and they repair it with the same parts they get for their trucks/tractors . 
  that is embarrassing , however i have a high regard for lavrov , he 's a very good diplomat , has good and concise speeches , keeps his cool and has a very `` diplomatic '' way to talk . 
  such a joyful and friendly bear . 
  i think they 've always had one towards europe . 
  i do n't think that includes us though . 
  same in romania . 
  look , nobody 's saying you just get a tank out of the mud , pour fuel and go home with it . 
  it definitely takes cleaning ( which i can see is done by water jet ) and some maintenance but it 's not exactly what i 'd call significantly maintenance and repair work . 
  i think it took a day for that su-152 to have its engine started and move on its own . 
  of course you ca n't just go to battle after that and it 's likely to break down soon unless `` significant maintenance '' but you ca n't take it from them that they are extremely sturdy and simple . 
  not wwii russian tanks or vehicles , those were a monument of simplism and resilience . 
  i laughed out loud , so true . 
  while indeed , it would be impossible to find out , i do believe communism was the best solution for a few decades following the wars , our country was ravaged by war and took a lot ( maybe too many ) sacrifices but it got put into the right direction - industrialization , bringing education to the masses , helping people rise above poverty , creating the infrastructure , organizing the society etc. 
  however , communism ( at least how it as applied here ) has brought us everything good it have , and making a graduate approach to democracy and capitalism would have been the perfect transition . 
  before bringing any analogies with the west , keep in mind we did not have any culture of democracy , so capitalism would 've likely lead to what has been happening post 90 , exploitation of the many at the expense of the very few . 
  i 've never heard anyone to ever say we have an ugly country ... 
  very informative , but can you detail the spinners used to regulate the entire grid , i 'm quite curious as i 've never heard about it . 
  it 's not clear what they did yet , plus the protest was announced for a few days , a lot of people came from the country for it . 
  we do , but it 's not stopping deforestation , we need more drastic measures . 
  that 's partially correct . 
  it was legalized in '57 then again forbidden in '66 after the birthrate decrease was thrown on abortion legalization . 
  if vk is propaganda but fb is n't , you 're the owner of an incredibly biased mind . 
  again , vk is literally a russian facebook , you said it 's a propaganda machine . 
  so facebook is a propaganda machine ? 
  our president said that since internal investigations have proved there were no cia prisons here , he does not want to have more investigations . 
  that 's romania , usa 's bitch , and that 's our dumb american ass licking president ... 
  this is one of the reasons it pisses me off our government does n't invest * anything * in serious archeological and historical studies . 
  there 's so much more to learn :( .
