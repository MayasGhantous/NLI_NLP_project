  that 's saddening , but i 'm not sure about putin hate propaganda . 
  i think it 's because the problem of gays just received more attention that people have been sharing their opinions more , and of course , we 'll always have the phenomenon of adhering to bandwagons/mainstream . 
   i value your efforts to defend russia from western hypocrisy but in this case it is very out of place . 
  no i 'm not trying to do that , but by living in an eastern european country with horrible democracy problems , with not so respected electoral procedures , i understand that these are inherent in a young democratic state . 
   comparing their `` elections '' to anything happening in the west is extremely far off . 
  i 'm not comparing them , i 'm just saying that it was not an outright fraud . 
  for the record , i live in romania , which can be called western , and we have a lot of problems that unfortunately rarely receive attention from the rest of the world . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how better than the russians are we at democracy . 
  yes , we 're definitely better at freedom of press , but elections ? 
  that picture you showed me is nothing , we have buses full of people who are taken to vote for a candidate in different villages , millions of poor people who will literally vote whatever you want in exchange for a kilo of flour . 
  well , yes , but no one wants to do such a huge investment with so many risks and downsides . 
  nabucco was a failed project from the start . 
  the costs and risks were too big : iraq is way too unstable , iran wo n't do because of sanctions and because they are much closer to russia , egypt is unstable and seems that might realign itself , kazahstan is also pretty aligned to russia , so it leaves us with adzerbaidjian and turkmenistan . 
  i think it 's better to invest that amount of money in research . 
   yes these happen very often , and i believe in any place , especially considering that rusia is new to democracy . 
  same shit , maybe at even worse scale happens here in romania during every election , buses full of people moved from one section to another to vote twice , thrice or as many times as they get . 
  how much can they do it ? 
  irregularities are reported at the us elections as well . 
  i do not see something to that shows they are ** outright fraud ** but just problems . 
  russian parliamentary elections were pretty skewed , with many problems and i 'm sure it was planned to get them a couple of extra chairs . 
   and yes . 
  i see no problem here . 
  not one . 
  the reasons are clearly specified . 
  plus they would n't have had a chance . 
  everyone who had a chance , was there . 
  and you can see prokhorov did participate , which was regarded by most as the only real viable alternative for putin . 
   it 's not like they even attempted to keep in secret . 
  i do n't know russian so i have no clue what i 'm seeing . 
  that does n't mean the elections were n't correct . 
  there 's no real alternative to putin . 
  when he could n't participate , medvedev ( from the same party ) did and won . 
  the idea of `` democracy '' as it 's perceived everywhere is a laughing stock . 
  it perpetuates the point that you need to be powerful to be elected . 
  you need tons of money to make yourself known . 
   the duma elections were an outright fraud . 
  in the presidential elections nobody could get registered except his own scarecrows . 
  excuse me mister ? 
  do you have any proof for this ? 
  outright fraud ? 
  and all those who competed against putin in presidential elections are his own scarecrows ? 
  since putin is democratically elected , he should be defeated in the next elections , and while he 's definitely replaceable , there needs to be someone who is more popular , someone who can lead that giant , someone in which people can trust . 
  that is russia 's problem , there 's no real alternative to putin . 
  and i think even the russians who hate putin the most , would rather have him than jirinovski or the zyugov in power . 
  this is a main idea of western propaganda : we 're not fighting russia , we 're fighting putin . 
  which is n't true for some things , like that gay propaganda thing or this crimea is russia thing . 
  the russians , in a large majority back him up , so we 're not fighting one dictator that the people hate . 
  source please ? 
  i do n't mean literally governor , but someone who has that authority . 
   the executive power is represented by the council of ministers , headed by a chairman who is appointed and dismissed by the verkhovna rada , with the consent of the president of ukraine . 
  [ 5 ] [ 83 ] taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea, 
   compare this to the us presidentail voting where 40 % turn up and they win by slightly more than 50 % . 
  but that does n't mean it 's less legit because more people agreed . 
   because the person of the sovereign is shared equally both with the 15 other commonwealth realms and the 10 provinces of canada and resides predominantly in her oldest realm , the united kingdom , she , on the advice of the canadian prime minister , [ 1 ] appoints the governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties . 
  and you still think we 're talking about the same thing . 
  it was only 3 % of those who ** went ** to vote . 
  20 % of them decided to boycott the referendum . 
   also , the law did n't apply to the autonomous crimea . 
  if you still want to point out how autonomous crimea is , do it by pointing that they were n't allowed to elect their own governor , which had to be appointed by kiev . 
  smirnov is n't the transnistrian president , lol . 
  he lost the elections ( a couple years ago ) to an ukrainian ethnic named evgheny shevciuk . 
  this is a problem i have with our nationalistic movements who are very vocal about uniting with moldova , i ask what do we do with all the russians and ukrainians and other ethnics there and i get answered that we should deport them to russia . 
  i figure that 's very wrong , for both ethical reasons and practical reasons , we already have some problems with the hungarian minority , lucky for us hungary is very weak , can we deal with the future russian minority without creating conflicts ? 
  can we absorb and integrate them , are we cold headed enough to reach a compromise ? 
  my point is that russians have the same right as romanians/modovians to live in there . 
  sure it 's been a big injustice to break that part of our country , and the russians have been brought after , but we ca n't try and reverse this by doing more wrong . 
  exactly , that is why russia has the biggest community of tatars , and most of them live there and have their own state inside the federation called tatarstan . 
  i 'm not discussing what crimean tatars have suffered , that 's not debatable , i am arguing that sometimes things change and you can not use history as an argument for the same actions to happen in the present . 
  russia has the biggest tatar community , so what 's your point ? 
  got some data on it ? 
  do we have any source on this ? 
  methodology please ? 
  because it does n't look reliable . 
  it 's not like russia did anything to prevent iraq or libya , outside of strong worded letters . 
  so they used american precedent , and probably americans will use this russian precedent next time ... and so on . 
  they do n't have any treaty , get your facts right . 
  a memorandum is not legally binding unlike a treaty . 
   this is n't good and there have to be a lot people in the kremlin who are worried and furious at putin . 
  not really . 
  you seem to overplay this and think rich people will suffer . 
  rich people never suffer from these . 
   what about the fact that in a country which imports everything russia does n't really need to import everything , they have any resource they need , including human work force . 
  remember iran , which does n't have any power compared to russia , they forced iran to develop everything internally , which is actually better for them in the long future . 
  also , western countries sanctioning russia wo n't work at all , because they do n't mean that much . 
  as opposed to nk or iran where the whole world did sanction them . 
  russia will just switch to asia . 
  russia is russia , it will never sink too deep , it 's too powerful . 
  one day markets go down , next day they go up . 
  too much fuss about it . 
   now if the police could really keep noua dreapt\u0103 away from us during the procession , everything will be fine . 
  those are ultra nationalists , we do n't like them either . 
  and others will smell the opportunity and take their place . 
  well , you just got downvoted to hell and back . 
  what do you know of the events that helped shape this ? 
  truth is , if things get ugly , no one will be there for ukraine but ukrainians . 
  just so it 's clear , this is specific to the romanian - ukrainian border territories . 
  nope , he made himself a known rusophobe , he does actually hate them with passion . 
  romania for example , does n't really depend on russian gas . 
  we are quite energetically independent , and we could be 100 % independent with some investments . 
  we ca n't be blackmailed by russia with gas .
