  this stereotype comes from post wwii hollywood movies . 
  it 's not about direct threats but force projection . 
  just like russia or us are n't exactly using their armies to fight each other , they are n't insane . 
  they are using their armies around the globe to balance the geopolitical situation , and they are always used on smaller actors . 
  have you seen any big or decent wars around ? 
  no , just big actors stomping smaller actors . 
  excellent point . 
  but do you know what 's the problem ? 
  the west does the same . 
  we are refusing to listen to anything that opposes the west 's rhetoric . 
  that 's why we do n't have negotiations that work , the two parties are like two deaf kids talking to each other , just yelling their point of view and not hearing the others ' . 
  but would they actually join russia ? 
  does russia actually want them to join russia ? 
  that is the question . 
  because i believe the russian plan is to have them top level autonomy whilst being still part of ukraine , therefore having leverage on kiev . 
  ok , but let 's see it from another point of view . 
  the former power and the actual power , with help from foreign ministers , have reached an agreement ( which is even signed by everyone ) which meant having elections asap , and withdrawal of all abusing laws regarding protests . 
  why did they broke the agreement ? 
  because it seemed like a perfect transition , instead of throwing former power through sheer force . 
  i would n't say it 's completely because that , but it definitely plays a part and people should realize that . 
  because if we had the same situation with actors reversed , we would 've been seen a different affinity . 
  you just made a fool of yourself using this argument : ** `` you 're either russian or just ignorant '' **, 
   but somehow nobody seems to mention that the repeal was vetoed by turchynov , and the minority language law is still the same as it was . 
  but somehow , nobody seems to mention it was done only after russian troops started swarming crimea . 
  ministers from svoboda have been appointed in the government , i do n't like that . 
  i am a bit disappointed by what happened , i hoped the ukrainian people would change the whole corrupt political class , but instead they just paved way for the same corrupt politicians that were in power after the orange revolution . 
  the politicians that yanukovici won against , which makes it clear to see they did a very bad job last time . 
  so far , 3 hours later , not one report that could sustain what the article says , so i 'll assume it is fake . 
  while i do agree , the bias can also be seen in the proportion between the amounts of pro-russian and pro-west reports submitted . 
  so far , i 'll say it 's as unbiased as can be , and a very good source for information . 
  the live reporting seems to be much better now , especially since this is in europe . 
  i know they are n't , they do need to act professional and listen to orders , if orders say do n't talk , they wo n't . 
  but i 'd imagine the ukrainian would like to talk . 
  i just saw that pictures , i 'm using the live reporting in / r/ukrainianconflict , http://www.reddit.com/live/3rgnbke2rai6hen7ciytwcxadi it 's pretty informative , they put on everything they find asap . 
  but i was expecting more quality journalism , where they go speak with people , try to talk to ukrainian forces ( especially those surrounded ) and see what 's going on , and eventually with the russian forces , but i doubt those will be allowed to speak to journalists ... but they do n't seem shy from camera at all . 
  this has chance of being the first war that we can watch on the internet live , i can just now see journalists just taking pictures and asking questions from russian troops in the middle of fights . 
  do you have any source on that ? 
  i do n't get it , there 's a shitload of journalists in crimea at the moment , why do n't we get more reports/pictures ? 
  there is a knee jerk reaction because the western media is stronger , and over 80 % on reddit are westerners , who only view world through the western culture paradigm , and that is why they ca n't ( and do n't really want ) to even acknowledge the russian point of view . 
  i believe the general animosity against russians that stands from the cold war is partly to blame . 
  not that anyone will suddenly find russia to be completely legitimate , but they would at least understand they have some legitimacy and have strong reasons behind the actions . 
  i doubt it , they already had transnistria under boot which means as much leverage as needed in moldova . 
  plus so far they do n't have absolutely any legitimation , no right wing nationalists elected to rule the country , no one promoting even one law against the russian minority . 
  as a romanian , definitely ** no ** . 
  i 'm very upset that the idiots leading us let the americans built part of the shield here , i really do n't want us to be a target . 
  the only times when i believe us/other nato military troops of any kind should be on romanian soil , is when there are drills scheduled or when a war situation is imminent . 
  let 's just hope we 're not going to see bullets fly in any direction . 
  well , then you must be happy , because russia is n't staying aside while neonazi 's control ukraine and might wipe out other ethnics . 
  we have n't had a big armed conflict in europe , for quite a while , had we ? 
  this is just a formality , as the parliament asked putin to take ferm measures to assure safety of russians in ukraine . 
  it does n't mean there 's war starting . 
  hopefully . 
  because having relations with russia downgrading is worse on long term . 
  georgia was stupid , they saw that the russians were prepared to intervene , but they still went ahead and shelled villages in ossetia . 
  that 's exactly what i 've been trying to say . 
  we do n't want to try , we do n't want to reach another cold war . 
  the economical ties are very important as they somehow assure that we wo n't have major conflicts . 
  i think you 're starting to take everything too personally and get too emotionally attached in this . 
  have a break , take a walk in the park . 
  because if a serious war starts , we might never have the chance to do those simple things again . 
  well , it should not emit any territorial pretensions on crimea , sure . 
  but should it get over the fact that the government of crimea asked russia for help , to guarantee the safety of russian ethnics ? 
  ever since does the western world give two dimes about sovereignty ? 
  that used to be a russian line , remember ? 
  and they 've used it in both serbia , libya or syria . 
  see , i just called you up on double standards . 
  i perfectly understand what you 're saying , but you should try seeing this from the russian point of view . 
  first off , we also knew the potential consequences of the game , but we decided it 's worth . 
  it 's not like we were stupid and innocent without any idea of what will happen next . 
  how do you judge who broke the treaty ? 
  have we interfered in an internal conflict ? 
  yes we did . 
  does interfering in an internal conflict for one side , with the purpose of winning influence there , mean we broke the treaty ? 
  depends on who 's going to judge . 
  they did that to romanians in moldova as well . 
  it 's over and it 's past , we need to get over it . 
  crimea was part of russia for a very , very long time . 
  there are russians in ukraine and they have the same right to be there as the others . 
  with so many nationalists now being able to influence ukraine 's course , i would too want to see our government make a plan at least , to protect the ethnic romanians living there . 
  both options are equally bad and not viable . 
  if we 'd all follow moral relativism , we 'd probably have way less wars . 
  i do n't think russia could 've fought with media , as they are very inferior at this chapter . 
  they had an ace in their hand , which they used , and that is protecting russians . 
  i too believe it is a different class , but part of the same game , having the same purposes , power of influence . 
  as a romanian , any military activity so near , is very worrying . 
  but i ca n't help to call out the hypocrisy of the western world , which through powerful media institutions , has been pretty much internalized by a lot of common folks . 
  i see that just as worrying . 
   there is a difference between cheering somebody on and sending military to seize control , so i 'm not sure how it is double standards ? 
  we were n't simply cheering , we had an active campaign of demonizing yanukovich and probably contributed with money and promises to the opposition . 
  let 's not forget the sanctions imposed . 
  the russians are doing the same game , but in a different way , they sent in the military to parade to send a message , of back-up to ethnic russians and crimeian parliament , and of warning to kiev . 
  you can say they 're game is up one level , but it 's still the same game . 
  as for control , it was already under the control of crimea 's new prime minister ( who asked russians for help ) . 
  you must be one of the most stupid people i 've met on reddit , you ca n't even seem to read what i write so you answer to something totally different . 
  i was asking about russia , not ukraine . 
  never mind it , have a nice day . 
  as long as no shots are being fired and no clashes happen , i 'd say no . 
   good thing the new president has some brains . 
  this veto was more likely a result of russian pressure in crimea rather then a thoughtfully and willing act . 
  apart from that , the only action they saw so far spoke way more than any russian propaganda .
