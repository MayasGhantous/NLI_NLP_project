\u0434\u0430 and it brings memories , it 's terrifying . 
  * shivers * hello darkness my old friend !, 
  true , but there are other regions who did not have an ethic romanian majority either , but more illiterate , which they did not take . 
  i am pretty sure that current gagauzia was less romanian than cetatea alba , which had quite a large romanian population , maybe even majority , in the past . 
  oh , want independence , want to get on your own feet ? 
  let me take just this part of your country and manipulate your history from now on ... let me take a wild guess , russia by any chance ? 
  nah , it could n't be ` rolls eyes ' . 
  it is interesting how the most educated regions in moldavia were gobbled up by ukraine , whilst the red shape is now moldova ... 
  i guess literacy mattered too , illiterate populations are easier to manipulate and make think they are something different , something they 're not , right ? 
  seems the pattern is that the magyar , but especially the german minority were the places with the highest literacy , not surprising , since those were the richest parts of transylvanian society . 
  in wallachia ... things were surprisingly sad but ... oh well , we 've come a long way . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i do n't really care if your primary language is romanian or russian , as long as you speak romanian too , do n't held some unreasonable grudge against romanians , and are willing to integrate in a larger romania , you 're all but welcome to me . 
  quite frankly , genetically we are pretty much slavs too , also i am pretty sure after all this time most russian moldavians have some romanian genes and the other way around , so blood is not really the issue here , it 's will , at least for me . 
  sadly there are many russian speaking moldavians who have this hatred for romania i ca n't even understand . 
  what did romania do to them ? 
  do they hate us just because we exist , what is wrong with that ? 
  why are they so keen to love russia , did russia really love them , they took their ancestors and placed them in a poor and problematic region as moldova , there is nothing to be thankful to russia for ... and yet they still hate us - ____ - such is propaganda i guess , but it 's sad . 
  jeez , reddit is so picky . 
  - ______ - tell it to the article writers not me !, 
  the referee could have some fun with that too  ), 
  they called them equations in the newspaper so i used the word , i know they are just expressions :p actually they posted some math exercises too on the frf ( league ) web page , and links to math books etc. 
  anyhow , do n't bother with details too much , in one of their problems the result was that a player scored 9.5 goals  so eh ... do n't expect too much from them :p, 
  a bit of both , shit together and the eu . 
  eu placed pressure for this but it was romanians who started making a real change . 
  also the corrupt people involved in shady stuff are both romanians ( mostly ) but also many eu businessman and other outsiders . 
  so it 's a bit of both , eu helped but it was not the only reason . 
  and corruption was present in romania but it was also originally pretty accepted by the outside due to self-interests . 
  so we do n't feel like we are indebted to the eu for the change , but we are thankful for it . 
  literally the devil . 
  things are definitely improving in a way , not necessarily as in faster administration , it 's actually worse as now they are afraid to steal , so they do n't do anything all together , since romanian politicians have no interest to approve anything if they get nothing for it . 
  i wish it was a joke , but tragically it 's not . 
  however , they placed fear in all those little public servants who never did anything productive in their life ( not all of them , but many of them ) and who were little bosses all their life . 
  my father tells me they call this the ` worse government ever ' . 
  yes , bad for them , the leeches of society , for youngsters like me this is the dream becoming real , ciolos i love you !!!, 
  also , i think the most important effect is the hope that is getting born among the youth , that romania does have a future , that we can bring that future , and yes something can be done , we can improve . 
  yes we can !, 
  as a romanian currently in switzerland ( zurich ) i became more patriotic in the last years , going to romania on a yearly basis and seeing all the clear improvements , then i was when i left . 
  actually i was n't at all when i left but those last years reborn something in me , made me proud to be romanian . 
  yes , i am proud of my country , do n't care how many call me a gypsy or whatever , honestly fuck these people , and i will defend my fellow countrymen and get pissed when they are treated unfairly . 
  i do n't know if i will work full time in romania in the future , as my field of study is pretty specific , quantitative finance . 
  but i will definitely come back to romania to do business , one day , more often then not . 
  my dream is to even build some proper orphanages there as i heard all the problems with the state ones , maybe even fund some private hospitals for the poor ... of course only if i can get rich enough , but one can dream  ps : not only that youngsters believe they can make a change , but youngsters are also becoming less tolerant for bribery , for cheating , for breaking the law . 
  they have higher expectations , they want better quality in their life , etc etc. 
  the change in mentality is the real winner here !, 
  maybe not now , but in 30 years when this new generation is in power , things will be different !, 
  the youth are also less church loving , more lgbt friendly ( even though sadly still kinda homophobic ) , and a bit more critical , so i dream of improvements in those fields too in the future . 
  it 's true it was under a certain administration first , but not as much hungarian as mostly hasburgic , and usually under the administration of the stronger power . 
  we easily tend to forget about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum where the majority , although poorer were almost treated like slaves , having no rights whatsoever . 
  we talk a lot about the poor gypsies being treated like slaves , the poor jews etc. 
  nobody talks about how romanians where treated in hungary ... probably because we are white and christians , but the treatment was not any better . 
  so we wo n't forget that . 
  and you wonder why romanians were not so happy to be under hungarian administration ? 
  also did you know that when transylvania separated , the szekey protested together with the romanians ? 
  they did n't , nor where they treated like hungarians back then , they were their own thing ( just as estonians and the finish are 2 separate entities ) , the current rhetoric of them being hungarian is much more recent , and i think they just use it because it gives them more leverage when negotiating in this political conflict between hungary and romania . 
  the german minority which was just as large as the hungarian one ( but sadly went to germany during communism - we 're kinda sold ;( ) actually even voted for transylvania do join romania together with the romanians , another thing that your history book probably does n't tell at all , right ? 
  now let 's leave history behind . 
  what i 'm saying is , transylvania chose , and had all the right to chose to be part of romania . 
  transylvania was n't conquered , as many historicians tell you there , they chose in a vast majority to join us over you , ok ? 
  now that you understand this very important part , let 's talk about szekey-land . 
  i have no problem with giving autonomy to the szekeys , as long as they would prove that they won ; t isolate themselves even more . 
  i am afraid of a lesotho in romania , you forget the hungarians in romania are not on the margin like in slovakia , they are in the middle of the country !, 
  and even nowadays they tend to isolate in some scenarios where a romanian goes in their region and nobody can properly talk to him about some issues or he is even looked down upon . 
  with that i complete do not agree !, 
  as long as they are in the middle of romania , even if they were a separate state , they should try to work with us and learn proper romanian ( all of them ) and provide administration for all romanians , but if they do not do it even now when they are part of the country , do you actually think they will do it as a separate entity ? 
  until the szekey prove they are willing and will do this , i can not approve giving the autonomy . 
  if they prove willingness for such an integration of romanian communities and cooperation with the romanian state , i will support autonomy for szekey land with all my heart . 
  however , another thing i do n't like is this idea of them joining hungary . 
  they are not hungarians , they are szekey , and i doubt they would even want that . 
  do n't get confused by their current rethoric , they just use it as it gives them more leverage . 
  but they do not consider themselves hungarians , i know actual hungarians from the rest of transylvania who felt kinda discriminated in szekey-land for not being szekey hungarians ... so yes , i really doubt if they got autnomy they would want to be part of of hungary , was n't that what they protested against in the first place when transylvania separated ? 
  so do n't get your hopes up about that . 
  that 's how i view the issue , so whilst transylvania was a territory of the habsburgic ( not hungarian , the administration was hungarians only because there were more hungarians than austrians here , and they did n't want to give it to romanians as that would be a risk of secession - which did happen ) empire a long time ago , they treated a large part of their population ( probably the majority if we look at statistical data , which hungarians hate to do ) horrible , so they clearly did not deserve this territory . 
  and now the territory is where it belongs . 
  another one bites the dust  minimal sentences though :(, 
  the fact that we do n't have a day or whatever does not bother me at all , it 's not like it was needed or anything . 
  but the fact that after all we did for you in history most poles think we are a gypsy country due to some of our beggars going there , and even calling us the hellhole of europe , worst country in europe , or i do n't even know what other things i heard is ... very very disappointing privet polen , very disappointing !, 
  you would be surprised  ) some of your compatriots really hate the idea of romanian continuity in the region in any form ... no matter how much data that proves it you bring forth :p, 
  please excuse the poster up there . 
  if you pay close attention you will notice he is from transylvania ... you see , they have a bit of a superiority complex even against us other romanians , so do n't be too surprised by him :p, 
  meh , in romania we tend to concentrate all that mainly on 1 particularly of pains in die arsch neighbor . 
  then again , we are technically only 5 % balkan , so hey , what can you do \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  but we 're genetically more slavic than them :p i know , i know , i 've got to commit seppuku for defiling the proud 100 % romanxdacian heritage , but the truth had to be told . 
  but look at the plus side , the hungarians are even more slavic than even us , combined with a bonus of germanic and filthy romanian genes , i mean how dafuq can a blonde green eyed hungarian descend from a mongol ? 
  so it will certainly piss them off more than us , at least we 've got that  * hungary is a lie !, 
  calm your titties there my boy !, 
  we are not that ahead :p i mean sure , 10 years ago is right before the economic crisis , which did set us back quite a bit so ... in the hindsight , things were pretty nice back then , maybe you 're not totally wrong / jk actually , i honestly think we are ahead in 2 very important aspects ( there are other aspects , but not so important , where we or them are ahead ) : 1 . 
  momentum of growth - we are growing faster than them , and given that we are already ahead in economy , that means that instead of bulgaria ` catching up ' in the future , the difference will probably grow between the 2 nations . 
  corruption - in this aspect bulgaria is indeed about 10 years behind romania , it was even more than 10 years ago when the dna was created in romania . 
  they seem to be like us 10 years ago , not even being able to hope for a rich person to get arrested , and for many to be above the law . 
  and that makes me sad :( i wish they would protest or something and force their political class to improve in this aspect . 
  his comment on corruption is just hilariously idiotic , i wonder where he pulled it out from , his ass ? 
  but that 's it , in the rest of aspects we 're very similar . 
  in fact , we are so similar to them maybe we should consider a potential ** anschluss ** , 
  probably true . 
  ca n't say i did a market analysis on that to be sure , anyhow a major watermelon producer region nonetheless . 
  my stupid joke about friend chicken and watermelon was the point there  . , 
  60 tonnes of fried chicken o.o ? 
  also i am from a region where we have this location named ** dabuleni ** where 95 % of all watermelons in romania and 80 % of all watermelons in the balkans are grown ( it 's this desert like place with very sandy earth were watermelons grow best ) . 
  in conclusion , i foresee more african-american immigrants in our future / s, 
  not really , since the ukip 's voters view of the entire country is that of gypsies , and no matter how much the country develops , gypsies will still go to uk for benefits !,
