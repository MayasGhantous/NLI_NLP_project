i despise geert wilders , but i think i can agree with you . 
  building the european army would only mean increased funding and efficiency . 
  think about it . 
  even if the funding would stay the same on aggregate , removing 27 redundant hierarchies and departments would greatly increase our strength . 
  the only valid contention point is future involvement in conflicts outside of europe and the structure of the decision-making process . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  oh , no worries , those are the * good * immigrants . 
  she * rejected such claims * ? 
  oh then , i guess we can take her word for it . 
  you are completely and utterly wrong . 
  corruption is a cultural trend first and foremost , not a political one . 
  communism was not the first time romania had a government . 
  before that there was a royal dictatorship , a fascist dictatorship , and then a royal oligarchy , going back to the middle ages . 
  you 're trying to be ahistorical and this approach is n't compatible with reality . 
  i 'm not a fan of communism , but the corrupt environment of the romanian society ( and balkan countries in general ) stems from the ottoman occupation . 
  you 're kidding yourself if you think romanian society and politics was less corrupt before 1947 . 
  the communists simply preserved it . 
  we must remember that two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  the commission has n't handled ceta pr properly ( though they did a lot better compared to ttip ) , but in the end it is a favourable agreement . 
  this belgian posturing is n't praiseworthy . 
  hey people , i have an idea that will fix this issue : slashing government spending !, 
  yes , for a pragmatic reason : funding . 
  as it stands , esa has a laughably low budget , almost four times lower than nasa 's , even though it represents the space dreams of many more people . 
  ensuring adequate funding would allow us to do bigger things . 
  i do n't believe in such slippery slopes . 
  ttip and ceta have important differences . 
  somehow i doubt you were a remainer . 
  if we are to look at history , usually leftist parties are prone to becoming useful idiots , or at most , to be infiltrated by russian `` moles '' . 
  right wing parties , such as the ones currently in power in poland and hungary , are directly financially supported by the russian government and its private interest groups . 
  i bet you can also better understand the generalized russophobia in eastern european countries . 
  it 's basically shite like this x5 centuries . 
  the person that downvoted me should look up contemporary romanian orthodox churches . 
  they are ** not ** a pretty sight . 
  sure . 
  the rules are there to be ~ ~ broken ~ ~ bent . 
  theirs look good , at least . 
  sure . 
  and because romanian muslims are more sensible , they just dug up the pigs and re-sanctified the ground . 
  everything must be looked at in context . 
  as someone pointed out before , columbus was unnecessarily cruel and exploitative even for his time , and was a shitty explorer as well . 
  sure . 
  in a museum . 
  i usually am against leftist knee-jerking ( as a leftist myself ) , but columbus was a disgrace of a human being and his statues need not adorn european streets . 
  this goes doubly so with leopold ii . 
  a spectacular romanian website that deals with this concept : http://www.costingheorghe.ro/thenow/, 
  beautiful torygraph article in the vein of `` in 50 years there will be no more gingers ! '', 
  `` in 100 years there will be no more whites ! '', 
  because it 's like using the name oltenia to refer to the entirety of romania . 
  the theological and philosophical tenets of christianity have always been either factually irreconcilable with the world or morally irrelevant . 
  the few good christian philosophers we have had are almost inconsequential when compared to the great secular philosophers or moral teachers and radicals . 
  i mean , how many more times must we invoke the name of aquinas to justify christianity 's existence ? 
  it 's high time we dropped it altogether . 
  it is demonstrably not . 
  what we call modernity has been obtained by the sweat of secularists fighting against religious mores . 
  the freedom that we have now is in spite of christianity , not due to it . 
  we should n't enter the eurozone until ecb policies accommodate a bit more of the poorer countries ' interests . 
  it is used as such , and stupidly i might add . 
  it 's completely irrelevant if the romanians were `` first '' in transylvania . 
  for centuries they were the majority ethnic population without benefiting from any centrally-planed colonisations , ethnic cleansings , or displacements . 
  unfortunate as it may seem , the origin of the romanian people lies in the southern part of the peninsula . 
  the currently accepted ethnogenesis theory is quite weak when confronted by facts . 
  the similarity is coincidental . 
  * fa\u021ba * comes from latin * facia * . 
  false . 
  liberals do not tolerate intolerance . 
  we do not accept bigotry based on some fabricated absolutist moral law . 
  not surprising , since scandinavians seem to have a huge boner for american culture . 
  u-s-a !!!, 
  u-s-a !!!, 
  why are you moving the goalposts ? 
  the issue is n't that ** only ** the ussr sparked ww2 , but that they invaded poland . 
  and they did . 
  question : if nazi germany would have invaded poland after the soviet union , would you consider nazi germany as to not have contributed to the commencing of the war ? 
  i was just making light of the way your states are drawn . 
  and let 's not forget ** the longest straight border in the world ** that you share with canada . 
  it was quite awful . 
  but cevapcici with kaymak made everything better . 
  in fact , i do n't know if there is a tragedy that could not be neutralised by them . 
  i did eat burek pizza . 
  never again . 
  americans have an obsession with straight borders . 
  do n't deny it , kolozsvar !, 
  from my time in ljubliana , i can say that slovenia feels like a balkan italy . 
  or a central-european balkan country . 
  interesting . 
  typical anti-romanian sentiments from hungary !, 
  the rotherham case is n't brought up just because of the awful sexual crimes , but because the case was actively and aggressively covered up by the authorities specifically because the perpetrators were muslims . 
  if other pedophile rings were being ignored by government institutions because the perpetrators were white or european , you would indeed have a case . 
  and the joke goes swoosh over everyone 's head , 
  this looks quite bad , but is anyone actually surprised ? 
  things looked dodgy from the moment they closed nuclear power-plants and cranked up coal consumption , all in `` the name of safety and the environment '' . 
  he finally says something sensible . 
  took him a while . 
  countries like china and india have never held a holier-than-thou attitude towards climate change . 
  criticism against germany is much more justified , since their poisoning of the environment comes after ridding their country of `` those evil nuclear power plants '' . 
  the other countries ahead of them are outside of europe . 
  this is the europe subreddit . 
  no matter the outcome , things will never go back to normal . 
  it 's quite obvious that the uk ( england , really ) has started cutting its own nose off . 
  the eu 's rules have been known for decades - there 's no excuse for you , bitter leavers .
