  are you defending the sturmabteilung ? 
  also , you should check up on your history . 
  the sa ** also ** defended nazi rallies , but they were founded in order to disrupt opposing political actions and intimidate minorities and unionists . 
  well , we went back to the old system , relatively recently , after the 1989 revolution . 
  so you can always push for this . 
  being the birthplace of such a widely-used alphabet is quite the honour , so start a movement , undo cultural vandalism . 
  why not go to the pre-communist system ? 
  we did . 
  when you target * all of them * , it is arbitrary . 
  this is why we can not reason with fascists . 
  peaceful resistance and protests only work when the opponents are adherents of liberal democracy as well . 
  when fascists get in power , they wo n't give a toss about freedom of speech , so we should n't afford them this luxury either . 
  it 's not their fault , but they could help . 
  lives are at stake . 
  it looks like a modded simcity 4 map . 
  so bucharest is placed on manhattan . 
  yeah , probably ... 
  you 're replying to a troll . 
  this thread is getting brigaded , it seems to me . 
  at arms , push back the invaders !, 
  romania day in the eu parliament . 
  sarmale for everyone !, 
  it may also be rational to say that * perfect equality * might be the ideal to strive towards , even if you never reach it . 
  lower turnout is expected today . 
  friday and sunday will be a lot larger , i believe . 
  he does n't . 
  austerity lowers both living standards and collected taxes . 
  this is quite an infuriating trend in western european media in regards to eastern european events . 
  i could even picture a full-blown revolution with weapons and tanks , and you 'd only see a short story in the bbc sidebar . 
  a week later . 
   was this law never mentioned before the election so that the goverment actually cheated it 's voters bingo . 
  to be fair , many expected it ( even though it was never mentioned during the campaign ) . 
  to most , the far-reaching effects and the sudden push for the law were quite shocking . 
  too soon . 
  it ** just ** happened . 
  chill . 
  tusk is still in his pajamas . 
  that resignation was just political tactics in action . 
  the prime minister and the cabinet at the time had no direct fault in the events that triggered the protests . 
  the pm most likely resigned because of internal strife , and easily gave up power as a fuck you to the opposing psd faction . 
  the faction controlled by ... you guessed it , the current leader of psd . 
  yes . 
  the damages that are attributed to him are now below the limit of prosecution . 
  not even remotely comparable . 
  i wish the uk protested as hard as romanians have and will . 
  your complaints are founded . 
  you could have the same quality or better for a lower price in a single-payer system . 
  a private healthcare lobby group places private healthcare systems at the top of the list . 
  nothing sketchy here !, 
  it 's hard to find something * not weird * in their set of beliefs . 
  it depends . 
  there are plenty alt-right christians - read about [ christian zionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_zionism ) . 
  they hate jews , but want jews to control israel for the second coming of christ . 
  oh , and they also hate muslims . 
  obviously . 
  question : if a behaviour or object is banned for secular reasons , but allowed in religious settings , is this fair ? 
  in other words , if a comparable act of dominance and oppression ( covering their hair , face and body ) was enacted by european men against european women , should the government not intervene ? 
  thanks . 
  unless someone compiles an actual study on this subreddit , i believe we 're comparing anecdotal evidence here . 
  but , in my experience , the only comments that survive the downvotes are the ones that do not spew hate and simply propose building refugee camps in syria . 
  i personally disagree with them , but do n't wish to throw them in the same category with fascists and neo-nazis . 
  in the early days of the crisis , even moderate views skeptical of the open borders approach were violently downvoted . 
  we 've now reached a sort of equilibrium . 
  veil apologists itt : 1 ) b-but these women are wearing the veil voluntarily !, 
   5 minutes later ... 2 ) by banning the veil , their husbands/families will keep them confined to their homes !, 
  they get promptly downvoted . 
  when a subreddit becomes biased , those comments are at the top of the page . 
  r/europe is safe . 
  false equivalence . 
   why do you think the eu relies on turkey i do not think that we rely on turkey . 
   i would be totally fine with turkey being under the rule of russia and withdraw from nato . 
  turkey is not an ally of europe but a threat to the continents security . 
  you may very well be fine with them under russian control , but i am not . 
  and i tend to believe military and political strategists are n't as well ( unless i see a good analysis debunking my position ) . 
   as the interest in the middle east decreases and focuses towards far east turkey is not a loss , in fact europe profited from turning away from turkey since it meant to develop independent approaches to secure eu-borders . 
  a black sea controlled by russia ( do n't forget the bosphorus strait !! ), 
  would be a complete nightmare for eastern europe . 
  usr is torn between left-wingers and neo-liberals . 
  not cohesive enough . 
  in order for them to actually ** do things ** instead of reacting , they need to split . 
  this is why i never sleep with the heating on . 
  either wood , gas or electric . 
  the eu must keep turkey close as close can be . 
  by that i mean , germany must do whatever they want but release a polite , double-speak statement . 
  because fuck the turkish leadership , but still , we do n't want to push them further into russian hands . 
  it 's incredibly shameful that we have to choose between social services and anti-corruption fight . 
  there 's no credible party offering both . 
  we romanians have a tendency to really shit on ourselves . 
  the amnesty bill is a disgrace , but poland is in much greater shit than us . 
  i would gladly have any of our main parties ( psd , pnl , usr ) than law and justice . 
  if the only alternative to the social-democrats is privatisations , frozen minimum wage and austerity , then psd will continue to win elections in a landslide . 
  i 'm sure brits ca n't wait to become the new sacrificial generation . 
  this is an arbitrarily-chosen border . 
  it was only chosen because it more or less separates countries with a european culture from countries with different cultures . 
  which goes back to what i said earlier . 
  the only thing that defines europe is the culture . 
  au contraire . 
  cultural europe is ** the only thing ** that exists . 
  there is no clear geographical border between europe and asia . 
  our shared cultural environment is the only thing that makes us european .
