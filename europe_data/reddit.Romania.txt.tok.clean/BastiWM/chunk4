  and i contend that is also the thing that matters the most . 
  because badmouthing your own country is an eastern european thing . 
  went to ljubljana . 
  drank some cockta . 
  was disappointed . 
  it was like the bastard child of coca cola and dr. pepper , in a bad way . 
  true . 
  i hope we 'll pass these hurdles and advance towards the federation . 
  but it will happen slowly . 
  we 're currently trying not to drown in nationalism and separatism . 
  i predict the opposite , sort of . 
  i believe the uk 's economy will rise at a higher-than-expected rate , but the growth will not be translated into better living standards for average britons . 
  on the contrary , in order to maintain their gdp development , they 'll turn into one of the largest tax havens in the world . 
  this may trigger a trade and tariff war with the eu . 
  i 'm sorry for being so gloomy at this time . 
  i wish , but i 'm afraid not . 
  it 's now denmark 's and netherland 's time to shine in blocking further integration . 
  theoretically , the uk could thrive after brexit . 
  it could improve the lives and wealth of its citizens greatly . 
  but you know that wo n't happen . 
  benefits will be cut , markets deregulated , vital services privatised . 
  well , i was n't claiming that they had them during the battle of berlin , that was just a comment you made about soviet advance in europe . 
  i meant the western allies could have leveraged the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki against the soviet union . 
  well , the americans did have nuclear bombs ... 
  the so-called failure they 're invoking is insulting , to be quite honest . 
  disregarding the industry that they tested this in , the point of a shorter schedule is to improve the lives of the citizens ( with an expected financial hit ) , not to lower employment costs . 
  otherwise we would still be working 12-14 hour days . 
  it seems even mighty sweden has forgotten there is more to life than a p&l sheet . 
  my reaction to this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ufmvo5lu58, 
  homicide rates are influenced by economic development , culture and access to firearms . 
  let 's not beat around the bush - it 's obvious why romania has a higher homicide rate than czechia . 
  but it would be worse with a higher availability of weapons . 
  conversely , you would have an even lower rate with stricter gun control . 
  wrong . 
  czechia has a firearm-related death rate ( per 100.000 ) of 2.01 . 
  romania has a rate of 0.14 . 
   the right of the country welcomes this , even if they do n't realize that will be the result . 
  the left as well . 
  you look at the motive , means and context . 
  in this specific case , it is quite obvious the rnc was hacked as well , but their juicy stuff is being kept under lock for some long-term blackmailing . 
  perhaps . 
  trump himself was hacked as well , but assange mentioned his private and political leaks would n't be that interesting . 
  yeah , sure ... 
  that is absolutely true . 
  it boggles the mind that someone can willingly defend ** selectively ** publishing information . 
  accurate but incomplete data is sometimes identical to lying and falsifying . 
  ah , i was unsure if that was what you originally meant . 
  cheers !, 
  you could have not elected them , but then the other side was just as bad , you know ? 
  homosexuality does not correlate to childhood trauma . 
  it may not even be genetic , but it 's perhaps triggered by random hormone releases in utero , during the fetus ' development . 
  pfft . 
  i mean , this is seriously troubling . 
  but you know what 's worse ? 
  those mean atheists disparaging religion on forums . 
  allegedly . 
   in the middle ages , christianity managed to imprint upon a violent and highly tribal set of warrior societies that the killing of ~ ~ women , children and ~ ~ the clergy ~ ~ where ~ ~ was not acceptable . 
  ftfy, 
  this is a plan i can get behind . 
  this is how you 're supposed to do it , germany !, 
  romanians never let pesky western nations ruin their heritage by themselves . 
  this is the single most powerful eu programme that promotes a true european cooperation and identity to the next generation . 
  if it 's also promoting clubbing , drinking and apparently orgies , it 's fine by me . 
  it 's ... a joke . 
  true !, 
  one of my favourite sayings . 
  the world is becoming a scarier place by the day . 
  i now apparently agree with sarkozy . 
  damn ... 
  it 's not just that . 
  the nordic model shifts the safety burden from employers to the government , which allows for greater business flexibility without leaving people for dead . 
  if it was just neo-liberalism , without their incredibly extensive welfare state paid-for by high taxes , scandinavian countries would have collapsed already . 
  : i do n't want it to seem that i 'm a fan of deregulation and giving free reign to companies , i 'm just describing the state of affairs . 
  even scandinavian countries are having their nordic model eroded by neo-liberalism . 
  it 's spreading like a cancer . 
  i bet our numbers went down since train travel became free of charge for students . 
   that was after charlie suffered more seizures that damaged his brain , if he had seen him prior to those the situation would 've been much different . 
  the legal battle stalled charlie 's transfer and ultimately lead to it being too late for the american doctor to even try anything . 
  you seem to put much more faith in a single american doctor who admitted his exaggeration than in the countless british doctors who evaluated this situation and cared deeply about charlie . 
   an absurd statement . 
  they did n't even have an expert on the disease there , america did . 
  doctors are n't perfect , they make mistakes all the time . 
  the doctor ** s ** who had direct contact and intimate knowledge of his affliction were in a much better position to make this decision . 
   another ridiculous statement . 
  the right thing to do is to try everything . 
  even if the procedure is a failure then maybe the knowledge gained can help someone else in the future . 
  this is objectively false . 
  medical professionals have the duty to strike a balance between downsides and benefits . 
  they have a duty to avoid unnecessary suffering . 
  charlie was a human being , not a lab rat . 
  incidentally , the treatment proposed in america only showed promise on lab rats with a similar but different affliction . 
  it would not have helped him . 
  not really , no . 
  the parents ** do not own ** their child . 
  his illness and its treatment fell under the purview of the world 's best pediatric hospital . 
  they knew his chances of survival were null and refused to allow him to suffer needlessly . 
  the american doctor was also at fault here for over-hyping his offer in lieu of more data . 
  after he researched more on charlie 's case he also admitted there was no chance for a cure or even a small improvement . 
  difficult situation and an even more difficult decision , but it was the right thing to do . 
  this is exciting in a bad way .
