there are things that are regularly talked about in euro , but we pay in lei , at the day 's exchange rate . 
  for example mobile phone rates , and whatnot . 
  we do the opposite ... 
  i do too , but given the context , i think it was a bit over the top . 
  thank you . 
  please erase your edit . 
  it 's really not funny . 
  i 'd say hate is really too strong a word in this context ... 
  good luck trying to sell de-centralisation in romania ... 
   the former russian occupation zone is a part of russia today . 
  not really . 
  eastern poland is mostly former [ congress poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_poland ) , which belonged to the russians . 
  western poland is [ pre-wwi german poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z2cgzbc.jpg ) . 
  interbellum poland had a coridor to the baltics . 
   `` resourceful '' the resource being other people 's wallets , 
  that 's because op has a bad case of inferiority complex . 
  askreddit thread : [ redditors who lived under communism , what was it really like ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1zpo1u/redditors_who_lived_under_communism_what_was_it/ ), 
  yeah , well below the 6 % they get in parliamentary elections , but apparently it 's comparable to the 2009 score ( see [ here ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-opinii-18447936-primele-concluzii-dupa-turul-1-plus-paradoxul-unei-tari-care-mortii-voteaza-linistiti-iar-viii-probleme.htm ) , last point ) i have no idea how they are gon na play it in the 2nd round tbh . 
  the voters probably gravitate towards iohannis , but i 'm not sure about the party , because atm psd more determined to compromise on issues dear to udmr ( autonomy and stuff ) . 
  also expect the hungarians to vote overwhelmingly for iohannis . 
  context : * government party is center-left * diaspora is overwhelmingly center-right, 
   wait , is `` turk '' used in a derogatory sense by anyone ? 
  i 've certainly never seen it used that way . 
  well it is used in the phrase \u201e are you a turk ? '' in romanian , meaning \u201e do you not understand what i 'm saying '' . 
  but the word turk itself is considered perfectly neutral in any other context . 
  it only has a slight negative undertone in this specific phrase ( so it 's not an ethnic slur per se ) . 
  to add some context : even in the previous elections , the islamists had less than 50 % . 
  they only won in the sense that they were the biggest party because the secularists were fragmented into multiple parties ( overal scores was aalong the lines of * 40 % islamist , 40 % secularist and 20 % populists * ) . 
  even so , ennadha ( who ruled in coalition with 2 secularist parties ) is on the moderate side of the `` islamist spectrum '' , closer to a european christian-democrat party than the nutcase islamists of other muslim states . 
  they even cracked down on hard-line salafists and such . 
  really now ? 
  that happened sometime in the 10th-11th century ffs ... 
   and there is nothing the gagauz can do about it . 
  except seccede with full russian political ( and maybe even military ) backing . 
   if moldova democratically joined romania except , you know , there is a different regime in transnistria . 
  and you realize that the the vote to join romania would not be held in transnistria , right ? 
   romania would have the right to occupy transinistria just like serbia had the right to occupy kosovo ? 
  just like georgia had the right to occupy south ossetia and abkhazia ? 
   romania would have full military backing of the nato . 
  if you attack a territory under peacekeepers , be they legitimate , or no , you are counted as the aggressor . 
  you are the one opening hostilities . 
  as such , [ article 5 of the nato treaty ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty ) does not defend you . 
  fuck it . 
  let 's just nuke the planet !, 
  * \\ #unicelularmasterrace *, 
  maybe he just wants hungarian majority areas ... 
  indo-europeans should be repatriated to northern ukraine/southern russia , and the rest of europe given to the basques . 
   i 'm not sure what levers russia would have if romania occupied transinistria . 
  if romania occupied transnistria , russia would declare war , and we 'd be fighting russia alone , since we would be the aggressors in such a scenario ( so we can kiss nato assistance goodbye ) . 
  good look convincing the g\u0103g\u0103uz to give up rights they won ( such as the autonomy ) . 
  we 're either getting reunification without g\u0103g\u0103uzia or autonomy in szeklerland . 
  not to mention that fidesz has more than 2/3 of parliament since 2010 . 
  they do n't need no jobbik , and never have . 
  are jobbik in government or even in negotiations to enter government ? 
  happy cake day !, 
  rather ok , i 'd say , although rarely goes in depth , so people are ' t very familiar with the \u201e who does what '' part . 
  but key events are covered . 
  the most widely circulated news are the ones that have to do with romania somehow . 
  the coverage is neutral towards positive , given how we 're a pretty europhile nation . 
  it had a leveling effect . 
   as someone from cluj , i feel more at home in prague , czech republic than i do in moldova or bucharest . 
  people and the cities feel more alike . 
  that might be partially because of the architecture . 
  habsburg cities have the same vibe , no matter which country they are in . 
  i have realtives both in the south and in transylvania . 
  there are differences , no doubt about it , but we 're not as central european as we like to think   that 's actually very interesting . 
  in 2000 transylvania voted for vadim , rather than let iliescu win again . 
  it 's actually that they voted `` less for iliescu '' , than `` more for vadim '' . 
  you can see it in [ vadim 's voting map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_vadim.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_vadim.svg.png ) , that transylvania is about as `` vadimist '' as oltenia and dobrogea , but in the latter two iliescu gor more votes . 
   i disagree with you though . 
  i think the romanian identity is purely a national and linguistic one . 
  i think that the ethnic identities are according to the old principalities , such as moldovan , ardelean , oltean , muntean , etc. 
  not sure what you mean by this , tbh . 
   this seems to verify a rumor that i was formerly doubtful of , namely there are not only romanian and hungarian identities in romania but also something sort of a common transsylvanian one , in the sense that even romanian transsylvanians feel in a way different from others . 
  well , it 's complicated . 
  the primary identity is still overwhelmingly the ethnic one , but there is also a regional transylvanian one , mostly within the romanian ethnicity . 
  of course , there are some , mostly transylvanians , who greatly exaggerate the difference ( think [ along these lines ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo )  ) , andthere are some , mostly southerners , who get angry whenever anybody mentions that there might be some differences . 
  anyway , communism also did some leveling of the differences , and the hungarians here are also more `` blakna '' than they 'd like to admit   what is the main difference between the two candidates ? 
  main difference ? 
  the party supporting each . 
  psd , the center-left ( so to speak ) , has always been strong in the regat , while the right-wing parties ( here , pdl , center-right ) has always had an advantage in transylvania . 
  you can see this transylvanian anti-psd sentiment in many presidential elections : ** 1990 ** * [ only round ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/romanian_presidential_election_1990_-_overview.svg/1000px-romanian_presidential_election_1990_-_overview.svg.png ) ** 1992 ** * [ iliescu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_iliescu.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_iliescu.svg.png ) ( center-left ) vs [ constantinescu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_constantinescu.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_constantinescu.svg.png ) ( center-right ) and [ funar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_funar.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_funar.svg.png ) ( far-right ) * [ round 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_first_round.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_first_round.svg.png ) and [ round 2 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_second_round.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1992_-_second_round.svg.png ) ** 1996 ** * [ round 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_first_round.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_first_round.svg.png ) and [ round 2 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_second_round.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_second_round.svg.png ) * [ iliescu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_iliescu.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_1996_-_iliescu.svg.png ) ( center-left ) ( the center-right was more fragmented this time ) ** 2000 ** * [ round 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_first_round.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_first_round.svg.png ) ( collapse of the center-right , far-right candidate reaches 2nd round , and also wins most counties in transylvania ) * [ iliescu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_iliescu.svg/1024px-romanian_presidential_election_2000_-_iliescu.svg.png ) ( in the second round everybody and their mother voted for iliescu , so the nutcase vadim tudor does n't make president ),

   do n't know why op did n't compare it with that . 
  this map is old , and has been floating around the web since before 2011 . 
  it 's not op 's . 
  my first thought as well . 
  why the fuck did n't they use a divergent color scheme ? 
  the saxon settlement is the relevant one when talking about `` architecture in the old towns in transylvania '' , as / u/acidburnzdeleted did . 
  the schwabians were settled in banat and satmar ( partium ) , so outside transylvania stricto sensu , and were rural settlements . 
  oh , i know . 
  i welcome criticism of my work . 
  tbh , the only place in western europe that felt to me like it went through communism . 
  first german setlement was in the 13-14th century ( transylvania saxons ) second german settlement was in 18th century ( danube schwabians ) , and it was outside siebenb\u00fcrgen proper . 
  the balkan wars were at the beginning of the 20th century . 
  thank you for the kind words !, 
   the city was indeed a bit overwhelming at first , but we got the vibe of it pretty soon . 
  it really has a lot of sides to it , not to mention all the history we absorbed . 
   muslim turks ( and also tatars ) have never been good at keeping records as opposed to christians ( i assume in christians ' case , church played a big factor for keeping records in order to collect taxes , i may be wrong though ) it really depends on which christians we are talking about .
