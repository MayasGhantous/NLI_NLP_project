    it 's this which large elements of the media ( and , it would seem , david cameron ) missed . 
  even now , when you ask people about the european parliament ( you know , the way you do , down the pub ) you get back the `` powerless talking shop '' quip . 
    except it is n't true . 
  it used to be . 
  but now the ep can hire and fire the commission , block or amend almost any eu law , including the eu budget , and now , as david cameron has discovered , threaten to veto any european council nominee for president . 
  the european parliament just took on her majesty 's government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , and beat it . 
  powerless talking shop ? 
  they 'll be wearing `` our parliament can beat up your prime minister '' tee shirts in the espace leopold this week . 
    for years , europe 's leaders kept getting stick every time they negotiated a new treaty . 
  europe , they were told , is n't democratic . 
  their response was to throw a few bones down the stairs into the basement where they kept their pretend parliament . 
  but nobody seemed to notice that the parliament was gobbling up everything it was given , and growing , and suddenly there 's a banging on the basement door and europe 's leaders discover there 's a fully grown parliament standing in front of them , and it 's not happy living in the basement anymore . 
    jean claude juncker can see the new reality . 
  for the first time ever , we have a european commission president who did n't get his job purely from the gift of the eu 's presidents and prime ministers , sitting around a dining table and holding an election by after eight . 
  his name was one the table early , picked by the epp , and the parliament was adamant . 
  the council has the power to nominate whomever it wants , but parliament was only going to accept one name . 
    juncker is parliament 's man . 
  he knows it , they know it , and if he wants a second term , he 'll have to remember it too , and being the savvy old operator he is , there 's no doubt he will . 
  he is the prime minister of a majority of the members of the european parliament . 
  they are the hand that feeds , not the member states . 
    after all , do you know who ( and only who ) has the power to sack juncker ? 
  the parliament . 
  not the member states . 
  yet another bone the member states threw down the steps without thinking , hoping it would keep the shouting from the basement down . 
  now look what they 've done . 
    the whole affair can be looked at two ways . 
  one , the british way , is of an old euro federalist playing the game much better than britain 's poor outclassed prime minister . 
  britain outsmarted once again by devious backroom continental dealers with their compromises and everybody must win a prize ways . 
    or there 's another way . 
    how was juncker 's outgoing predecessor , jose manual barroso picked ten years ago ? 
  the answer : out of the blue days before the vote , pretty much unknown to anyone who was n't portuguese . 
    yet those of us who actually care about this stuff ( the trekkies of international democratic politics ) have known that juncker , the socialists ' martin schulz and the liberals ' guy verhofstadt were the names on the table . 
  in a debate before the european elections , transmitted on telly ( with an rte host , by the way ) and hardly watched by anybody , schulz said very clearly , with juncker to his side , that the next president of the european commission would come from one of the candidates on the stage . 
    this was n't some secret backroom deal . 
  this was the most transparent process for we have ever had for choosing a commission president ever , and whilst it 's true that most europeans did n't even vote in the european elections , that 's a choice in itself . 
  the whole point of being a democracy is that you ca n't make people participate in it , only have the right to participate . 
    but this all matters . 
  in 2019 , when the next european elections come around , will the media and the member states pay closer attention to the nominees of the european parties ? 
  you 're damn right they will . 
  this is a game changer .

  please do n't insult other users . 
  yeah . 
  it 's from the ottoman turkish word for jew . 
  interestingly , in romanian in shifted to meaning `` grumpy , uptight person '' . 
  it 's the standard format for / r/etymologymaps it includes yiddish though . 
  [ confirmed !, 
   in 2013 , thousands of hungarians demanding self-rule marched in transylvania . 
  they demand self-rule in the form of autonomy ( largely the szeklers , which are about half of romania 's ethnic hungarians ) , not independence . 
  the article makes it seem a bit as if all the hungarians want independence for all of transylvania ( where hungarians make up about 1/5 of the population ) . 
  the pro-autonomy part is mainly the compactly-hungarian enclave of szeklerland [ in eastern transylvania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/hungarians_in_romania_blank.svg/1000px-hungarians_in_romania_blank.svg.png ) . 
  actualy , it should just be `` alpina '' , because it contains both things `` cisalpine '' and `` transalpine '', 
  i have a feeling this will end up on / r/badlinguistics ... 
   please shut the fuck up . 
  please keep this conversation civil . 
  we call these `` maxi-taxi '' and we have them in some cities . 
   arabs are also semitic . 
  a word can mean something different than its etymology . 
  '' [ antisemitic ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitic ) '' means anti-jewish , even if there are other semitic peoples out there , including the arabs .

  ** yes it is legal ** moldovan [ law nr .

  ** flying [ the state flag ] alongside flags of other countries  \u00a7 ( 4 ) in places where the state flag is flown and european union flag may also be flown . 
  [ eu/coe ] ( http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000100.htm ) :  the principles of use of the european emblem by third parties have been set out in an administrative agreement with the council of europe . 
  this agreement has been published in the official journal of the european union on 08/09/2012 ( [ 2012/c 271/04 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:oj.c_.2012.271.01.0005.01.eng ) ) . 
   according to this agreement , any natural or legal person ( `` third party user '' ) may use the european emblem or any of its elements , as long as this use  ( a ) does not create the impression or assumption that there is a connection between the third party user and any of the institutions , bodies , offices , agencies and organs of the european union or the council of europe where this connection does not exist ;  ( b ) does not lead the public to believe that the user benefits from the support , sponsorship , approval or consent of any of the institutions , bodies , offices , agencies and organs of the european union or the council of europe where this is not the case ;  ( c ) is not made in connection with any objective or activity which is incompatible with the aims and principles of the european union or the council of europe , or is otherwise unlawful . 
   if the use of the european emblem complies with the above conditions , there is no need to ask for written permission . 
   registration of the european emblem , or a heraldic imitation thereof , as a trade mark or as any other ip right is not acceptable . 
  all the press is in a good mood i see : bbc : '' [ german sausage makers in * meaty * fine over price-fixing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28310694 ) '' * [ emphasis mine ] *, 
  yeah , but i was talking about the region in general , not strictly ethnic romanians . 
  the whole point of this comment-thread is that `` region a within a-u fared better than region b within ottoman empire '', 
  th implication is that it was more developed because it was part of a-h , * as opposed to the rest being part of the ottoman empire . 
  * was n't transylvania more developed in 1918 than the rest of romania ( which was part of the ottoman empire ) as well ? 
  please do n't insult other users , no matter how incorrect you find their ideas . 
  thank you . 
  cgpgrey should make a video explaining the whole nomination process to people . 
  i 'm getting tired of the * `` everybody rubber-stamped him because merkel said so , eussr amirite ? 
  '' * narrative . 
  is this a form of protest , or only a form of goodbye without any negative undertones ? 
  so what you 're saying is that farage is like hitler ? 
   has a de facto opt out that the likes of poland , czech etc do n't have . 
  what is the difference between sweden and the rest ? 
  i know the title is exactly how amnesty wrote it , but would you mind resubmitting it without all caps . 
  it makes the submission look very aggressive . 
  thank you . 
  there is no oppression of roma , it 's all their fault . 
  \u201e you keep talking about the atrocities that happened to your ancestors , but no word on the atrocities committed by the bolshevo-comunist kikes against us ? '',
