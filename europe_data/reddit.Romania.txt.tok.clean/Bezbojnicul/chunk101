  people in the former eastern block who paid attention during russian class . 
  german probably is more widespread in former austro-hungarian parts . 
  take into account that those same areas also held a significant german minority until recently . 
   i do n't think romanians borrowed a lot from the french and italians but they all share the same [ 1 ] common ancestor . 
  a bit further down the same article : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language#french_and_italian_words  since the 19th century , many modern words were borrowed from the other romance languages , especially from french and italian ( for example : birou `` desk , office '' , avion `` airplane '' , exploata `` exploit '' ) . 
  it was estimated that about 38 % of the number of words in romanian are of french and/or italian origin ( in many cases both languages ) ; and adding this to the words that were inherited from latin , about 75 % -85 % of romanian words can be traced to latin . 
  the use of these romanianized french and italian loanwords has tended to increase at the expense of slavic loanwords , many of which have become rare or fallen out of use . 
   in fact if i remember well , romanian is the closest romance language to vulgar latin . 
  well , romanian is conservative in some aspects , but the most conservative afaik is [ sardinian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_language ) . 
  [ again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language#historical_grammar ) :  romanian has preserved a part of the latin declension , but whereas latin had six cases , from a morphological viewpoint romanian has only three : the nominative-accusative , the genitive-dative , and marginally the vocative . 
  romanian nouns also preserve the neuter gender , although instead of functioning as a separate gender with its own forms in adjectives , the romanian neuter became a mixture of masculine and feminine . 
   rutabaga , kohlrabi , turnip we have that , but in its season . 
   why the flag has black/improvised mast [ ? ] . 
  why is that unusual ? 
   are all the policeman universally ignoring their own laws ? 
  not always ... why ? 
   what to do with all the bani if nobody accepts except for the 1 ban , i 've never had problem with it being accepted . 
   law does not enforce respect of the national symbols , in this case - the currency ? 
  we 're not too big on ` enforcing respect on national symbols ' . 
  not to mention the fact that people do not see loose change as ` national symbol ' . 
   why are there so many cables in the air ? 
  yeah , we 're working on that . 
    where is the winter ?!, 
  not in the west . 
  coldest area is [ szeklerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeklerland ) and the harshest snows are in moldavia and eastern muntenia . 
  [ article from last year ] ( http://www.toledoblade.com/world/2012/02/13/heavy-snow-cuts-off-thousands-for-days-in-eastern-europe.html ) , but you 're not going to see that in arad . 
   in latvia we have hard time to cope with new words . 
  we literally called `` startup '' - slut [ palaistuve ] , `` browser '' - web page overlooking program [ t\u012bmek\u013ca viet\u0146u p\u0101rl\u016bkprogramma ] , and i still have to find what t\u012bkl\u0101js is , just as miriads of other plain idiotic words . 
  i think in the case where you get long multiple-word expressions , you should just adopt a word from english ( or some other language ) . 
  * broser * ( im not sure how you would latvianize it ) should be the way to go . 
   also romanian has fair share of turkic words yeah , but the latin , slavic , and neo-latin ( via french and italian ) are the dominant ones . 
  we also have some greek , some hungarian ( some generally , and loads more regionally in the transylvanian dialects ) , some german here and there . 
   i still have n't been to oradea , waiting for better weather whenever you want to come , just leave a message . 
  btw , what 's your impression so far ? 
  what 's odd , and what 's familiar ? 
   is n't romanian at least in part `` an artificial construct '' ? 
  depends on how you define `` artifical construct '' . 
   and most ( all ? ), 
  european languages have been subject to standardisation efforts . 
  well yes , but that kinda makes all of them `` artificial '' in some sense . 
  i mean , nobody actually speaks pure standard dialect . 
   the fact that you still have n't incorporated moldova is , on its own , shameful . 
  is n't galicia like , your moldova ? 
   lack too many basic words for today that have to be invented , a lot of languages had this problem in the 19th century . 
  hungarian did pretty ok in generating new words out of existing ones when it transitioned from vernacular to literary standard  because if we borrow from others , then it eventually at some point will turn into the interlingua . 
  by that definition , romanian is interlingua ( or at leat turning into it ) . 
  we borrowed massively from french and italian . 
  virtually , what hungarian did through internal innovation , we did through borrowing . 
  because hundreds of languages are dieing out , so i feel that the effort put into a conlang would better be spent on those . 
  all languages have dissadvantages and advantages , so we might as well chose from one of the hundreds that are going the way of the dinosaurs . 
  also , if there ever was a pan-european language , it would have to be latin . 
  i 'd rather we revive that , with all its inherent prestige , than some artificial language . 
  brb . 
  going to kick moldova in the shin out of frustration ... 
  put historical pan-european things , or regional things . 
  an ancient map of europe . 
  multi-national famous people . 
  like marie curie , or king whatshisface iii who ruled over 3-4-5 european nations . 
  figures of ancient mythology , like europa . 
  roman emperors . 
  we could have 2 , at most 3 designs for each note , but 27 ( 28 soon ) is freakin ' ridiculous . 
  i 'm against conlangs . 
  i 'd rather revive latin , or better , a dying european language , than breath life into an artificial construct . 
  my parents , one from central transylvania , the other from the south-east both learned french ^ 1 - russian ^ 2 . 
  they are born in the mid - '60s . 
  i think it varied with time . 
  i remember somebody born in the mid '50s telling me that there was less russian in his generation , and more english . 
  english language is a thing in romania since the fall of communism , so we need more time . 
  before that , french and russian were the main languages taught in school . 
  used the list [ here ] ( http://blogulblog.wordpress.com/z-postari-pe-alte-teme-lingvistice/etimologia-unor-cuvinte-tiganesti-din-romana/ ) with slight modifications ( i.e. 
  added a few missing ones , removed some with very limited use ), 
  i do n't feel that makes it more defensible . 
  serbia de facto lost kosovo while it was bombarding/killing kosovans . 
  the fact that they did n't declare independence right away , but waited some years does not suddenly give legitimacy back to serbia . 
  ( just so we 're clear , i support the independence of both s. ossetia and kosovo , minus the northern part ), 
  i wish the euro would switch to plastic . 
  i 'm gon na miss our plastic money when we switch to the euro .

  lets move the discussion [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/169gbi/what_are_the_most_importantbest_books_from_your/c7tyqby ), 
  user / u/shenpen reminded me of ** mircea eliade ** , whose * history of religious ideas * is quite an interesting read . 
  ask folks over at / r/askhistorians . 
  the best answer out there regarding how much of it is accurate or not . 
  also take note that oliver stone has left-leaning sympathies , so you should take that into account as well . 
   i 'd say even more defensible . 
  how so ? 
  have n't read her , but the nobel thing is kinda important . 
  more like : ** suggested threads : ** * tv shows * books * food ( ? ), 
  * whatever ... 
  [ meta ] all these threads ( tv shows , books , etc ) should be linked to in the right side for the future . 
  a lot of interesting info . 
  seconded .
