  also worth mentioning that ** herta m\u00fcller ** , recipient of the 2009 nobel prize in literature , is a romanian-born german . 
  i know it 's complicated . 
  but you can get rough estimations by way of opinion polls ( but i do n't know of any ) . 
  so what ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they were in the minority by 1990 . 
  yes , if they enjoy popular support . 
  but the hungarians are mostly asking for autonomy , not outright secession . 
  those are a tiny minority . 
  there are others who in large part are content with the status quo . 
  i mean the uk and its peoples . 
  white guilt over what ? 
  which non-white part of the planet did sweden enslave ? 
  thank you !, 
   it is , but mem is german police slang for them . 
  what about non-nomadic gypsies and nomadic non-gypsies ? 
   the term `` zigeuner '' is actually being used , for example , the counterpart to `` anti-semitic '' is `` anti-zigan '' , not `` anti-roma or anti-sinti '' yes . 
  the word `` antitziganism '' is used in other languages too . 
   in luxembourg , portuguese make up for 20 % of the population . 
  should we claim it ? 
  when you hit 50-60 % you can claim it . 
   this leads me to believe that the uk is n't quite exerting its influence fully . 
  it 's not . 
  it could , with a little effort , get some eastern european states on board some of its projects . 
  i have a feeling he might be sarcastic/trolling . 
  how come sweden is so relaxed with immigration ? 
  do you guys need the workforce , or is it on humanitarian grounds , or what ? 
  the rules seem incredibly lax . 
  what is the profile of op 's link . 
  is it like the daily mail or is it serious jurnalism ? 
  there are more then just a few . 
  they do n't stand out that much though . 
   many people/countries support an independent kosovo . 
  but they do n't support an independent catalonia , an independent scotland , or an independent kurdistan . 
  they also do n't support the right of majority serbian populations in northern kosovo and elsewhere , and of albanians in the area surrounding tetovo to determine their future via referendums . 
  i support all of those . 
  yes . 
  a tri-state nucleus ( uk-fr-de ) is better imo than a franco-german core , which might often turn into a circle-jerk . 
  the uk is a breath of fresh air in many instances , but it needs to alter its modus operandi , and start forming strategic partnertshipt within the eu . 
  it might find that `` new europe '' is sometimes more economically liberal than continental old europe ( as per bad memories of state intervention ) . 
  there is a lot of potential the uk is failing to harness , as well as a lot of valid criticism that gets ignored , because it acts the way it does . 
  the estimates are in the 1.5-2 .5 million range . 
  ireland , iceland , cyprus and malta are all on islands . 
  hell , even if the irish do n't like me saying it , they are closest culturally to the brits , yet do not display this `` island mentality '' . 
  good . 
  we used to have a greater romania party in parliament up until 2008 . 
  they were mostly ignored by the larger parties , and eventually the electorate got bored of them . 
  nope . 
  unoficial estimates put the roma of romania at about 10 % -15 % of the population, 
   it 's not unreasonable to ask for the roma to change first . 
  this is not about who needs to change ** first ** . 
  both parties have shit to sort out . 
  saying the others should change first is just an excuse to do nothing for inaction . 
  confirmation bias, 
   romania tried integrating them for a long time , then they just gave up because it deemed it impossible . 
  romania is still working on integrating them , moving slowly in the right direction . 
  we never tried that hard , but we never gave up either . 
  there was no moment when we gave a big collective sigh and said `` fuck 'em '' . 
   they were provided with everything they needed , but they still went begging . 
  reminds me of people who win the lottery , but ca n't adapt to having lots of money . 
  i thought * roma und sinti * was the correct term . 
  so i heard elections are coming . 
  how much support do they have in the polls ? 
  are they gon na enter parliament ? 
  also , will their request for a referendum be dismissed ? 
  have n't had a * gypsy thread * in a while . 
  let the flame wars begin !, 
  alright , makes sense . 
  thanks for the answer , 
  i know . 
  probably that 's why you 're the only ones working on this while the others are out on siestas . 
  thank you . 
  spain has a lot of ground to cover to reach the level of ni . 
  the eta bombings were a good start , but people just do n't seem that serious about it . 
  tipical latins . 
  a lot of talk and cursing , but little action . 
  also , i asked another redditor about [ how voting works ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1669ye/plastic_bullets_fired_in_belfast_police_fired/c7t99gk ) . 
  maybe you know as well . 
  so if a child has only irish citizenship ( because that 's what the parents chose ) , can he choose at 18 to get a british one too ? 
  would he get one easily , or would he have to go through all the hoops as an immigrant ? 
  also , how does voting go ? 
  seeing that there might be a section of the population that has only irish citizenship , is it based on residence ( i.e. 
  if you live in ni you get to vote ) ? 
  thank you for taking the time to answer . 
  being \u201e identified '' can mean a lot of things . 
  i 'm simply asking if a child born in belfast , to parents from belfast , gets automatic british citizenship ? 
  so you can have half of northern ireland not having british citizenship ? 
  nationalism is not unlike a religion . 
  ah , northern ireland , western europe 's mini-balkans . 
  are n't citizens of northern ireland automatically `` british citizens '' ? 
  true : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mordovia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia but then again , to the average person : west of moscow = russia proper , east of moscow = siberia !, 
   nobody hates anyone unless that other person is committed in being a problem . 
  false . 
  some people hate foreigners ( as a group , including the ok ones ) for being foreigners . 
  obviously , you have to sugar coat it to sound ok , like cultural nativism . 
  i 'm not saying there is n't valid cultural criticism going on , but let 's not kid ourselves . 
  some people are xenophobic because ` fuck foreigners ' . 
  between a xenophobic local , and a well assimilated foreigner , guess which one needs to change his ways to adjust to the modern world and so called \u201e european values '' . 
   you would have to be completely blind to claim that the focus on israel is not extremely disproportionate to what israel actually does . 
  the level of protection the us affords israel is also disproportionate when compared to other allies . 
   europeans have no objective reason to dislike jews the way they do , and yet , they still do !,
