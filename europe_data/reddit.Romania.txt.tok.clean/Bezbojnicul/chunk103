  wow , talk about generalizing . 
  maybe if you do n't like stupid generalizations about jews you should not make stupid generalizations about europeans . 
  i bet you do n't like it when people say that \u201e americans are fat and stupid '' , now do you ? 
  yes , danish does sound like german with an lazy/anesthetized mouth . 
  sort of a chilled-out germanic . 
  and swedish does have a rhythm to it . 
  do n't know about norwegian though . 
  will watch \u201e troll hunter '' to form an opinion . 
  also , how does icelandic and faroese sound to you guys ? 
  you can find it on torrent . 
  i demand the image of \u201e mighty europe '' !, 
  subtitles ? 
  i do n't speak an iota of german . 
  romanian tv shows suck too . 
  romanian cinema on the other hand ... 
   it is in practice not the same deity . 
  by that definition every sect has a different deity . 
  muslims actually say that christians and jews worship the same god but they got him all wrong because of reasons . 
  christians believe jews worship the same god , and have mixed feelings about weather allah is the same as \u201e god '' or not . 
  i have no idea about the jews though . 
  the first two sound interesting . 
  and pumukli is cool ( watched it on hungarian tv as a kid ) . 
   kosovo police arrested two protesters and pushed several hundreds of albanians 20 meters away from the church so serbs could briefly enter the church . 
  good to hear the police are doing their job . 
  also \u201e borgen '' ( danish ) is awesome . 
  i 'm just about to finish season 1 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borgen_ ( tv_series )  borgen is a danish one-hour political drama television series . 
  it tells the story of a charismatic politician , birgitte nyborg , who unexpectedly becomes the first female prime minister of denmark . 
  `` borgen '' ( `` the castle '' ) is the nickname of christiansborg palace , which houses all three of denmark 's branches of government : the parliament , the prime minister 's office and the supreme court . 
  relative to other countries i 'd say it is . 
  i remember being denied french shengen visa in 10th grade . 
  we wanted to go on a summer school trip consisting of northern italy , barcelona and france up to paris . 
  next year , we did n't need the schengen visa anymore  . 
  i remember sitting at the czech border point , just me , my dad a friend of his and a car full of bulgarians , filling out some useless papers , while poles , slovaks and hungarians wizzed by waving their ids . 
  i remember my dad 's passport in the 90 's , full of border stamps . 
  it just blows my mind that i was born in a time when getting out of the country was a special priviledge , and many died trying to flee , and now i can go to lisbon and the only border is the romanian-hungarian one , 10 km from where i live . 
  it now takes less than a minute to cross , and i do n't need no passport , just my everyday id . 
  no stamps , not nothing . 
  and even that border is on its way out as soon as the dutch give us their ok to join schengen . 
  people actually moved across the border , as houses are cheaper in the villages in eastern hungary then the villages/suburbs around oradea . 
  as a romanian , i was a bit confused why this is news . 
  ( we have 2 + million citizens abroad , about 1 million of which in spain ) . 
  found this : http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np710_en.pdf ( page 4 )  in 2011 , the number of rumanian citizens [ in spain ] experienced the most substantial growth in absolute terms , with an increase of 30,263 persons, 
  i get the feeling brits do n't really get coalitions . 
  former education minister daniel funeriu is also a guy who for the first time made some reforms in the system with actual substance . 
  just as hated aas macovei , being from the president 's party . 
  also , renate weber ( pnl ) is doing a great job in the european parliament , and i vote pnl on the ep election despite the fact that i would never vote for pnl on the home front while it 's under the current leadership , them being ideologically closest to my preferences . 
   feels nice to be in an * homogenous * state . 
  ftfy, 
  you kinda said it . 
  relaxed and friendly people , good food , beautiful landscape , especially the beaches , nice warm weather . 
  greece . 
   as a romanian you probably very well know that gypsies are born to commit crimes , that 's how they `` earn '' their money in addition to welfare money . 
  not all romanians are simpleminded xenophobes , as i 'm sure not all czechs are . 
  that 's not really answering my question . 
  the soviet union was made up of 15 \u201e soviet socialist republics '' ( russia was the biggest , others were estonia , ukraine , latvia , georgia , kazakhstan , etc ) . 
  when the ussr broke up , the 15 states went their separate way . 
  kaliningrad was not a state , but only an oblast ( province ) of russia , like pskov oblast , smolensk oblast , and so on . 
  because all the other parts of the former soviet union were not \u201e russian territory '' , but \u201e soviet teritorry '' . 
  russia was just one part of the ussr ( albeit the biggest and most important ), 
  my bad . 
  i need to pay more attention next time . 
  - ~ ~ the border here is pre-1918 ( before ww1 and the creation of modern poland ) while the op shows pre-1940 ( interbellum ) ~ ~, 
  from [ last time this was posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/oxhsa/pre1918_german_empire_borders_and_2007_polish/c3ktx3w ) : http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/zombie-borders/  for one of the most remarkable examples of this revenant quality of former borders , we need only hop across the oder-neisse line to poland . 
  on the map of post-communist poland 's election results , one curious division keeps cropping up : the old imperial border between russia and prussia/germany , as it existed when poland did not , from 1848 to 1918 . [ ... ], 
   the fit between modern election result and ancient border is almost perfect . 
  but how can this be ? 
  the ethnic composition of the region has been shaken up thoroughly since the border last was in effect : following the second world war , germans were expelled from areas east of the oder-neisse line , and poles moved in from former polish areas to the east , now annexed by the soviet union . 
   yet in spite of these completely different demographics , the former border keeps resurfacing at polish national elections -- a zombie border indeed . 
  earlier treatment of this question [ 10 ] has offered up a few intriguing hypotheses : the resettled poles have n't had the time yet to `` get conservative '' ; the newer polish areas have richer farmland ( or a denser rail network ) , are thus more likely to have liberal politics . 
  but an answer that fits the question as snugly as the old border fits contemporary election results remains elusive . 
   it may seem overly deterministic to link modern election results to ancient borders that no longer exist ; but similar claims have been made about election outcomes in france , ukraine and the united states , to name but a few countries . 
  something simmilar for romania and its 2009 presidential elections : http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/oz2tn/romanian_historical_regions_and_the_2009/, 
  thanks . 
  it was n't behind a paywall when i submited . 
  weird, 
   fidesz won 51 % of the votes in the elections which translates to 68 % of the seats in the parliament that 's one fucked up system, 
   of those ~ 7000 released about 5500 are gypsies . 
  why not vote for a third option . 
  lmp maybe ? 
  ( who else is there besides them ? ), 
  well , this [ sounds kinda familiar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iliescu#pardons ) ... 
   more than 60 % of all poles , bulgarians and romanians return home after a few years of working in another country . 
  source for this ? 
  very few of the 2 + million romanians working abroad returned home . 
  and about half of them live in spain ( which has huge unemployment ) , and a lot have worked in construction ( which notoriously went bust ) . 
  for a lot of people , returning home is a sign of having failed abroad . 
   e.c. 
  european capital, 
  brussels , e.c. 
  not many internet users in romania , but the internet itself is top notch . 
  blue banana also includes western germany, 
   it 's like gmo vocabulary . 
  what a beautiful metaphor !, 
   you ca n't have a culture without a language to express it . 
  is there an irish culture outside the gaeltacht ? 
  found [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/15gz7m/extraterrestrials_like_it_out_west_map_showing/c7mcfpj ) . 
  aparrently [ source  ( http://www.larryhatch.net/eurall.html )  this map shows ufo sightings for all dates in europe , recently refreshed and brightened to 4 pixels each . 
  place-name `` tags '' show in dark green characters , e.g. 
  ger for germany . 
   sightings densities for each country depend heavily upon the activities of their respective ufo groups , journals and investigators .
