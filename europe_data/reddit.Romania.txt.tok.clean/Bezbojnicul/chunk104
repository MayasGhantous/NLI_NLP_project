  note the disproportionate sightings densities for britain and france , compared to germany , holland and points east . 
  cultural factors aside , the simple fact is that larry hatch ca n't read german , dutch , polish etc. , introducing a definite cultural bias . 
  +5 in oradea ( western romania ) , zero snow, 
  fair enough . 
  have an upvote . 
  caps lock ? 
  omfg !!!, 
  cr\u0103ciun is used as a family name in romania as well . 
   i believe you mean our francophilic period . 
  i mean our early nationalistic period , when scholars would bend over backwards to find latin etymologies for words . 
   many of the `` obvious '' etymologies of romanian words are the result of balkanism does that mean it appeared out of thin air ? 
   romanian * beat * and * fire * are `` obviously '' derived from their english homophones what are * beat * and * fire * 's english homophones ? 
  sounds like you might be talking about homographs . 
   most of the times this is done completely disregarding meaning of either word . 
  i think in this case the meaning fits quite well between the slavic and the romanian and hungarian words . 
  similar to the romanian * colind\u0103 * hmmm : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koleda, 
   countries that have their own minorities to oppress so they ca n't recognize other country 's minorities ( spain , slovakia , romania , china ) countries that fear secessionist movements . 
  this is not about \u201e not recognizing other countries minorities '' , but about fearing a precedent that can lead to secession . 
  chine recognizes 56 minorities , having a lot of ( theoretically ) autonomous areas . 
  on the other hand the minorities in romania are hardly \u201e oppressed '' . 
  while autonomy is not yet something the szeklers enjoy , minorities enjoy a lot of rights .

   you 're better than scholars like rosetti et . 
  scholars make mistakes too . 
  cre\u0219tinortodox.ro and dacia.org ? 
  really ? 
   yes , it 's similar to the slav kracun , but other theories are just as compelling . 
  no they are not . 
  they are deeply biased on ideological grounds . 
  you 'll note that most linguists who propose a latin etymology are from a period when our latin-ness was a national obsetion . 
  there are many documented instances when respected scholars have ignored obvious etymologies in favour of latin ones that were far less likely . 
  given the geographic spread of the term korochun and its meaning and the fact that its phonetic evolution is far more natural than a hypothetical * creationem * ( the only other theory with any merrit ) , i 'd bet my money on krochun . 
  a similar phenomenon is easter , a pagan holiday becoming a christian holiday * edit * a word, 
  nope , it 's a slavic holiday 's name . 
  it was considered the day when the black god and other spirits associated with decay and darkness were most potent . 
  max vasmer derived the word from the common slavonic for `` to step forward '' . 
  the first recorded usage of the term was in 1143 , when the author of the novgorod first chronicle referred to the winter solstice as `` korochun '' . 
   it was celebrated by pagan slavs on december 21 the longest night of the year and the night of the winter solstice . 
  on this night , hors , symbolising old sun , becomes smaller as the days become shorter in the northern hemisphere , and dies on december 22 , the winter solstice . 
  it is said to be defeated by the dark and evil powers of the black god . 
  on december 23 hors is resurrected and becomes the new sun , koleda . 
   modern scholars tend to associate this holiday with the ancestor worship . 
  on this day western slavs lit fires at cemeteries to keep their loved ones warm , and organized feasts to honour the dead and keep them fed . 
  they also lit wooden logs at local crossroads . 
  in some slavic languages , the word came to denote unexpected death of a young person and the evil spirit that shortens life . 
  also , moldovan romanian is the same as romanian romanian in the sense that * cr\u0103ciun * is written with ** \u0103 ** there too . 
  there 's a a saying in romania that the black sea is our best neighbor . 
  there are people still alive who lived through the 1940-1945 annexation of northern transylvania and subsequent oppression . 
   why wo n't the romanian govt come forth first and apologize for things that happened just a few decades ago ? 
  what period are you talking about exactly ? 
   we are having lots of problems with this as is in the bilingual areas . 
  not that many problems , imo . 
   bezbojnicul , do you like the idea of a unified hungary-romania ? 
  i 'd find it impractical . 
  too much bad history . 
  but there might be some , mostly hungarians and maybe one or two romanians who would not have such a negative reaction to the idea . 
   i have no idea how romanians would feel about it , honestly i just expected them to strongly disagree . 
  yeah , they 'd probably strongly disagree . 
  the eu is the only union with hungary that people endorse . 
  my guess : a macedonian politician ( not sure if [ gruevski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_gruevski ) ) placing flowers at the a monument featuring a [ map of the region of macedonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/greater_macedonia.png ) edit : seems to be something about the [ ilinden uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilinden%e2%80%93preobrazhenie_uprising ) and [ gotse delchev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotse_delchev ), 
   i 've never really heard of anyone required to bring their own bedding . 
  stop focusing on the bedding . 
  i 've heard plenty of stories of people who had to buy they own medicine , their own anesthetics , their own bandages , and so on , because the hospital had no funds to buy them . 
   i 've been hospitalized in the past 5 years at tg . 
  mures , at bucharest ( fundeni ) and at timisoara and cluj-napoca municipal hospitals . 
  those are most developed cities , so the standards are higher then the general level in romania . 
  think the guys in moldavia have the money to go to fundeni . 
  you think the hospital in b\u00e2rlad or vaslui is as squeaky clean and well staffed as the ones in cluj-napoca ? 
  i live in oradea and i 've heard stories of medical negligence that are unimaginable . 
  there are many who prefer to go to debrecen in hungary ( 50km away ) or to a private hospital to get a surgery than risk the state hospital here . 
  and oradea is not a poor or under-developped city . 
   i also have two members of my family . 
  one as a doctor and one as an emergency nurse at tg . 
  mures smurd . 
  they both get paid on time . 
  on time , sure . 
  but the level of salaries in healthcare are low . 
  that 's why most graduates head west as soon as they finish school . 
  2800 doctors left romania in 2011 alone ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.ziare.com/stiri/spitale/romania-a-ramas-fara-2-800-de-medici-in-2011-1155452 ) ] . 
  sure it 's not as bad as 10 , or even 5 years ago , but it 's not as good as you \u201e feel '' it is . 
  of course no comparison is perfect , and some details might not be the same , but it 's not that far off as you think . 
  let 's see what else was in the comment you wish deleted :  an old man said that he could no longer afford the medication for his heart condition . 
  there are stories galore of pensioners not affording their medications . 
  things might have gotten better , but the days when on the first of the month the farmacies would have long queues of old people hoping to get subsidies meds on time are not that far gone . 
   his pension had been slashed by half . 
  pensions have been slashed here too as part of austerity measures . 
   he had worked for more than forty years , and he thought he had done everything right . 
  now he no longer understands the world . 
  an all too familiar feeling among romanian pensioners . 
   there are n't enough disposable gloves and catheters see above . 
  curroption is also endemic . 
  remeber [ this article ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/rn2d8/romanias_hospital_scandal_babies_left_to_die_as/ ) . 
  how is this not true ? 
  close one ... 
  a few would say hungary . 
   an old man said that he could no longer afford the medication for his heart condition . 
  his pension had been slashed by half . 
  he had worked for more than forty years , and he thought he had done everything right . 
  now he no longer understands the world . 
   people who go to a hospital must bring their own bedding , and even their food .
