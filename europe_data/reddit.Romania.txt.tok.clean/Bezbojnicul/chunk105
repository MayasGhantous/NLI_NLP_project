  since the cleaning staff was fired , doctors and nurses , who have not been paid for months , have been cleaning the wards . 
  there are n't enough disposable gloves and catheters , and the eu is warning of the danger of the spread of infectious diseases . 
  sounds like romania . 
  see you in the upcoming gypsy thread my friend !, 
  in romania we have : `` sas '' - saxon , for germans brought to transylvania in the 12-13th centuries '' \u0218vab '' - swabian , for germans brought to transylvania and banat in the 18th century `` neam\u021b '' - german , colloqiually `` german '' - more formally, 
  i kept it in the \u201e positive to mildly negative '' zone . 
  i also heard that it could come from * bez govor * - \u201e no speach '' or something like that , essentially , to speak nonsense , or to not speak ( our language ) . 
  kinda like neam\u021b for german . 
  although this etymology is very unlikely , afaik . 
  italians - \u201e macaronari '' - macaroni eaters french - \u201e broscari '' - froggers , as in \u201e frog-eaters '' bulgarians - \u201e bulg\u0103roi cu ceafa lat\u0103 '' - thick-necked bulgarians is a an expression used in a mild derogatory manner when talking about bulgarians russians is sometimes mockingly called \u201e fra\u021bii / prietenii no\u0219tri de la r\u0103s\u0103rit '' ( \u201e our eastern brothers/friends '' , in reference to the commie time propaganda ) moldovans are called \u201e fra\u021bii no\u0219tri de peste prut '' ( \u201e our brothers from across the prut '' , this time lovingly , as most are ethnic romanians ), 
  this is inevitable . 
  because greek orthodox and russian orthodox are not different branches with different beliefs such as the different protestant branches . 
  there is essentially no difference between russian and greek orthodoxy baring some aesthetic elements . 
  also autocephalous churches can choose the liturgical calendar they use ( some use the julian , some the revised julian , which is kinda like the gregorian ) * ) - when reffering to the russian church i do not mean old believers . 
  that 's different . 
  yeah . 
  romania should [ look like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/roreligion.png ), 
  * mo\u0219 geril\u0103 * - old man frost - commie santa , used to come on new years eve , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  now totally forgotten and replaced by santa claus * mo\u0219 nicolae * ( sometimes called * [ micula\u0219 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikul%c3%a1s ) * in transylvania ) - saint nicholas ( old man nicholas ) - 5 december ( kind of a santa light , brings candy and/or [ stick ] ( https://www.google.com/search?hl=ro&amp;rlz=1c2avsx_enro398ro473&amp;q=virgacs&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.yms&amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=685&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=ecvsupv1j8lg4qsy44gacq#um=1&amp;hl=ro&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1c2avsx_enro398ro473&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=nuielusa+de+mos+nicolae&amp;oq=nuielusa&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.425.1623.0.3506.8.7.0.0.0.0.477.1016.0j1j0j1j1.3.0.pchsnhac..0.0...1.1.ttpgjfna_-i&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.bge&amp;fp=62070acb56d080e8&amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=685 ) ) * mo\u0219 cr\u0103ciun * - santa claus ( old man christmas ) - on christmas . 
  brings gifts under the christmas tree . 
  you should expand the comment so others know at least schematically why he 's worth mentioning . 
  i always wondered what would have happened had the [ popovici plan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ) been implemented ... 
  i remember reading [ paul lendvai 's book `` hungarians '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hungarians-thousand-years-victory-defeat/dp/0691119694 ) and comming away with a good opinion on both de\u00e1k and sz\u00e9chenyi . 
   the austro-hungarian compromise ( kiegyez\u00e9s , ausgleich ) [ 2 ] possible , which was followed by almost 50 years of prosperity . 
  on the other hand the period after the ausleigh is remembered less fondly by the minorities inside hungary . 
  the romanians also have a good opinion of him . 
  after all , he kept ethnic tensions under a lid , and governed a strong country that told the soviets to go fuck themselves . 
  also , yugoslavia was ahead of romania economically until 1989 iirc . 
  that part that has less information than greenland, 
  kog\u0103lniceanu was apparently kinda antisemitic , but hey , nobody 's perfect . 
  on the other hand i find this hilarious :  in 1885 , kog\u0103lniceanu strongly objected to a national liberal cabinet decision to expel moses gaster , a renowned jewish scholar , stating that the latter was '' [ the ] only man who works in this country '', 
   in sweden prostitution is illegal afaik only for the customer . 
  am i wrong ? 
  while i agree with your assessment of udmr , i think op means historical politicians . 
  [ kog\u0103lniceanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihail_kog%c4%83lniceanu ) , together with [ cuza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuza )  following the crimean war , with prince grigore alexandru ghica , kog\u0103lniceanu was responsible for drafting legislation to abolish roma slavery . 
  together with alecsandri , he edited the unionist magazine steaua dun\u0103rii , played a prominent part during the elections for the ad-hoc divan , and successfully promoted cuza , his lifelong friend , to the throne * [ of both wallachia and moldavia , thus uniting them into the new country of romania ] * . 
  kog\u0103lniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles , and to secularize the property of monasteries . 
  his efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote , leading cuza to enforce them through a coup d'\u00e9tat in may 1864 . 
  however , kog\u0103lniceanu resigned in 1865 , following his own conflicts with the monarch . 
  a decade after , he helped create the national liberal party , before playing an important part in romania 's decision to enter the russo-turkish war of 1877-1878 -- a choice which consecrated her independence . 
  he was also instrumental in the acquisition , and later colonization , of northern dobruja region . 
  during his final years , he was a prominent member and one-time president of the romanian academy , and briefly served as romanian representative to france . 
  also , [ constantin karadja ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_karadja ) is worth a mention . 
  the guy saved over 50.000 jews during ww2 . 
   president of western sahara, 
   op , were there any quotes in bbc 's title when you submitted this ? 
  yes . 
  the [ eurostat press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_stat-12-185_en.htm?locale=en ), 
  i think it might have to do with the commie regime 's obsession with engineers . 
  a lot of emphasis was put on the hard sciences . 
  i remember reading that romania had the highest proportion of engineer graduates in the eastern bloc in the '80s . 
  something like 60 % of college graduates were engineers . 
  got 'em all !, 
  sounds a bit like [ drob ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drob ), 
   roasted chestnut . 
  have n't seen it anywhere else . 
  usually sold by street vendors . 
  we have this as well , 
  the relationship is the other way around . 
  the it sector is big because we are good at maths . 
  evenimentul zilei really went full retard lately . 
  it used to be in the normal spectrum , but now it 's dailymailesque, 
  [ schnitzel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schnitzel ) made from [ \u201e parizer '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mortadella#central_europe ) ( sort of a central-european mortadella ) was a dish invented in the commie days when real meat was almost impossible to get . 
  it looked smething like [ this ] ( http://aphextwinz.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/diapozitiv718.jpg?w=655&amp;h=491 ) . 
  aka [ \u201e salo '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salo_ ( food \\ ) ), 
  black tea plus milk is awesome in my book !, 
  armenian and azeri politicians or politicians from other countries ? 
  are people really focusing that much on the religious aspect ? 
  are n't you thinking about the latvians ? 
  there was a time when i was really into asian food and chopsticks and stuff but the offer was kind of small , so i would eat spaghetti and other foods with chopsticks . 
  i was * awesome * !, 
  spoon-fork-knife people . 
  asians are chopstick-spoon people , different paradigm . 
  or the [ balkan style ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/turkishcoffee.jpg/320px-turkishcoffee.jpg ), 
   i thought everyone eats noodle soup with a spoon . 
  me too . 
  i 'm in wtf mode now because of that thread, 
   i have n't seen any beggar that was n't a gypsy in over 10 years . 
  plenty . 
   insanity/deranged behaviour has usually nothing to do with killing sprees . 
  more often those are committed by people being pushed over the edge by stress/perceived injustice . 
  interesting . 
  any source for this ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
   that 's not the same as banning something , that 's limiting its presence . 
  well , then the us should \u201e severely limit the presence '' of guns . 
  * le *  and it 's banned because we 're generally a conservative people who think that obscenities do n't belong in the public sphere . 
  but i thought you guys  do n't just ban things because they 're nasty or inconvenient or do n't like them . 
   you mentioned a chinese who slaughtered similar number of victims the difference being that the 23 victims from china ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chenpeng_village_primary_school_stabbing ) ] were not \u201e slaughtered '' ( i.e. 
  implying death ) but \u201e slashed '' ( aka . 
  injured ) . 
  there were no deaths in china . 
  see the difference between a \u201e knife attack '' and a \u201e gun attack '' ? 
  * edit : a letter *, 
  the industrial parts were mostly in the area now known as the [ pridnestrovian moldavian republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ), 
   colour of skin , gender or sexual preferences are things that you ca n't decide by yourself , however culture , values and beliefs are something that you can decide . 
  what about language ? 
  can i discriminate based in language ? 
  i mean , you can always change your shitty language , n'est - ce pas ? 
   there is one culture in finland and that is finnish .
