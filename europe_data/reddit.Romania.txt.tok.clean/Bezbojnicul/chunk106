  really now ? 
  what about the swedes there ? 
  the sami ? 
   caribbeans came to the uk they were happy to get here , they had the language , 50 + years on theyre a respected part of british society it was n't all fun and games http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_african-caribbean_people#recession_and_turbulence.2c_1970s_and_1980s, 
   83.2 % still does n't add up to 100 % . 
  weird . 
  excelent post !, 
  but as far as i know , the polish state is kind of looking out for them as kindred west-slavs, 
   the average kurdish guy would only want his language and culture to be recognized and not be seen as `` inferior '' to turkish culture . 
  [ ... ] the current government is very sketchy and they are unlikely to allow anything like this , but they have passed laws allowing kurdish tv and press . 
  this should have been done long ago , but baby steps are steps too . 
  the problem is that even if the laws say something , it 's very hard to change people 's mindsets . 
  in 1990 , fresh out of communism , romania saw [ ethnic clashes in the city of t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) between the hungarians and the romanians ( each representing about half the city 's population ) . 
  between 1992 and 1996 , the ruling coalition , called the [ red quadrilateral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_quadrilateral ) had 2 ultra-nationalist parties in it . 
  in the early 90 's , people were still of the opinion that giving in to the hungarian minority 's grievances will ultimately lead to the breakup of the country , and [ transylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) will once again be [ taken away ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award ) by the hungarians . 
  today , hungarians have broad rights , the language is used by the state institutions wherever there are at least 20 % hungarians , and nobody gets paranoid about transylvania secceding . 
  hell , hungary is one of our closest allies , and was a big advocate of our integration into the eu . 
  my point is that kurdish tv and press and other baby steps is the way to do it. , and although people 's mindsets change slowly , they do change . 
  and as they change , opinions for secession will shrink as well , if all is done right . 
  are you sure this answer is for me ? 
   i do n't think that any minority should have special rights . 
  it would be perfect if people could just get over the clan-thinking . 
  ok . how do you suppose a country can get over the inherent inequality that the majority 's native language is the official language , while minorities have to learn an additional language to get by ? 
   but i also think it should be acknowledged that the german minority in silesia is a special case . 
  silesia has always been german , until the west-transition of poland after the second world war . 
  suddenly , german villages found themselves living in poland . 
  that is true for a lot of minorities . 
  post-trianon hungarians , minorities in the balkans , etc. 
   personally i 'd say a minority is native once the first of them has lived his/her whole life in a foreign region and yet retained the heritage . 
  like turks in germany ? 
  would n't the sorbian minority in germany be a more apropriate analogy ? 
   `` germans in poland should have as many rights as poles do in germany . '' i never understood this `` if others are idiots , we should be too '' argument . 
  to expand : [ map of gdp per capita per county ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/romania_-_nominal_gdp_per_capita_by_county.png/640px-romania_-_nominal_gdp_per_capita_by_county.png ) . 
  the west tends to be more developed due to historical reasons , but bucharest pretty much dwarfs the rest of the country . 
  i bet cluj-napoca is n't doing bad either ( but i ca n't find gdp/capita figures for the city ), 
  fair enough ,

  this was in bra\u0219ov , romania , and the woman seems to be a pentecostal . 
   mihail neam\u021bu ( one of the leaders of the ard ) when he was younger was a member in a neonazi organization and , a few weeks ago , he was in a scandal for quoting a fascist poet during one of his speeches . 
  godwin-ing this thread is not really helpfull , and it 's inviting where the others start yelling \u201e comunists !!! '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , neam\u021bu is an idiot . 
  i 'm not disputing their merits , but international context matters . 
  i do n't think pdl would have been as hated today as they are had the crisis not happened . 
  also , the context for growth started , [ some would say ] ( http://turambarr.blogspot.ro/2011/06/pib-ul-romaniei-1990-2011-doua-decenii.html ) , in 1999 with is\u0103rescu 's reforms . 
  i would have loved to vote for pnl ( and i probably will for the europarliament where they vote ideologically ) , but their current leadership scares the fuck out of me . 
  some more context about the other parties : pp-dd seams to have entered parliament as well . 
  pp-dd is a populist party , centered around dan diaconescu , a tv chanel owner/host . 
  his tv channel is the lowest of the low when it comes to quality , and his voters come mainly from the more uneducated segments of society . 
  pp-dd candidates had some of the most incoherent electoral messages i 've ever heard , but some people saw them as a 3rd option , an alternative to the two big blocks mentioned above , who had dominated politics until now . 
  udmr is the hungarian minority party , and they used to get a confortable 6-7 % in elections . 
  for the first time , they had competition from another hungarian party on the national level , the ppmt . 
  that ate away at some of their votes , ant they barely made it into parliament as they got a bit over the threshold ( and that is a bit of a shocker ) . 
  their usual mo is to negotiate with the winning party/coalition and get some concessions for the hungarian minority . 
  since 1996 they have either been in coalition with or supported the ruling party ( regardless of whether they are on the left or right ) . 
  as the winning coalition ( usl ) wants to change the constitution , the negotiations between udmr and usl have already started . 
   since we had one of the highest gdp growth rates in europe ( ~ 8 % ) while the government was formed by pnl a couple of years ago . 
  to be fair we were riding a good economic context and a property bubble back then . 
  they are romanian citizens . 
  the word \u201e romanian '' is entirely justified . 
  change sicilian to apulian or calabrian . 
  i actually like the fact that it has a randomness element to it . 
  ( not saying it 's good , but hey , at least the politicians are also confused by it ), 
   catalan and spanish languages are quite different there 's a bigger differrence between ligurian and sicilian than between catalan and castilian ( spanish ) i think , yet both sicilians and ligurians consider themselves italians . 
  just adding to your point that language does not necessarily determine ethnicity . 
  45/45 while hung over . 
  had no problems except the fact that cyprus was missing . 
  and estonia is next to finland , because they both speak finno-ugric languages . 
  simplest goulash recipe : \u201e a lot of everything '' . 
  true story . 
   it 's december , so by the end of the month , the emergency services will again be overwhelmed by people who ate too much and too bad . 
  that is also due to fasting ( the pre-christmas fast is long , and the christmas dinner is a shock ) , which is way more prevalent among the orthodox . 
  there 's a stereotype that if you want to eat good as a man , you should marry a hungarian girl . 
  my dad , a 100 % romanian confirmed this . 
  she says the amount of [ r\u00e1nt\u00e1s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rantas ) in food is way over the top . 
  i think you missed the logic . 
  in hungarian , * \u0151rs\u00e9g * itself comes from * \u0151r * , which denotes a guardian , a keeper , plus the suffix [ - s\u00e9g ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-s%c3%a9g ) , which turns it into an abstract noun . 
  so the words might not be related . 
  i think you 're reading too much into it . 
   after the mongol occupation , only a very small amount of germans were settled , mostly craftsmen at that . 
  they might have been few , but in transylvania they were a significant presence . 
  the saxons survived all the way into the 20th century . 
   in total , the ratio of hungarians to others dropped from 80 % to a mere 42 % !, 
  i 'm really curious as to how those population estimates were made . 
  im not trying to start one of those endless debates , but i always get the feeling that estimates made in the 19th century are a bit unreliable , given the risk of ideological interference ( i.e. 
  nationalism ) . 
  romania kinda likes all of the balkans . 
   as a romanian , this thread depresses me . 
  why ? 
  the word * rend\u0151rs\u00e9g * actually means * keepers of order * or * guardians of order * ( * rend * - order , * \u0151rs\u00e9g * - keepers , guarding ), 
  was n't there another wave of repopulation after the habsburgs reconquered panonia ? 
  when the schwabs were colonized ? 
   also you romanian guys seems to dig our history like it was gold , what 's up with that ( no offense just interested ) ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by that expression . 
  do you mean to say we like your history , or that we know your history , or something else ? 
  makes sense . 
   bulgaria , we share too much with them ( culture , traditions , etc ) that we never get along . 
  also , ever since the eu admission , we 've been in this competition , to not be the last country in the eu in terms of this or that . 
  also , the relationship with hungary has improved immensely in the last 20 years . 
  i think russia is viewed much more suspiciously than hungary today . 
   these things change all the time , in the 80s the poles had bad pr in romania because they `` invaded '' all summer resorts and tried to sell all sorts of watches , bracelets and such .
