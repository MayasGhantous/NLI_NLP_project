  i never heard this being thought of as something negative before . 
  yep . 
  a lot of words changed . 
  `` leh '' became `` polonez '' , `` fran\u0163uz '' became `` francez '' ( but only in the masculin ) . 
  i 'm not sure about `` ungur '' though . 
  i think it existed alongside `` maghiar '' all the time . 
  and i suspect `` t\u0103ut '' used to be common in transylvania before it was surpassed by `` slovac '' . 
  also i remember reading about `` beciu '' and `` pojon '' as names for viena and bratislava ( via hungarian ) . 
  a san stefano bulgaria would have been an interesting thing . 
  had it lasted , i 'd bet we 'd have no macedonian ethnicity today . 
  they helped liberate us too , but the love quickly went sour . 
   the hungarians assimilated the people they found in pannonia , which is why genetically they 're closer to their neighbours than to the other finno-ugric people . 
  also there were recolonizations in panonia after the ottomans were driven out . 
  some of the colonists were from outside hungary , and many of them assimilated into the hungarian ethnos . 
  that 's why there are quite a number of hungarians with german family names . 
  romanians do to . 
  `` neam\u0163 '' is used alongside `` german '', 
  the countryside brings figures down . 
  we 're not healthy , just not ( that ) obese . 
  i 'm somewhat surprised by hungary . 
  i did n't notice any significant difference in obesity . 
  ( i often travel to hungary , as i live near the border ), 
  the transylvanian hungarian cuisine is not as `` oily '' as the one in hungary . 
  plus , romania is more rural and backwards , so peasants do more work ( no tractors and shit ) and they have no time to get fat , due to all the labor . 
  also , the hungarian minority os not that large . 
  it 's around 7 % . 
  we are n't that healthy , tbh . 
  we 're just not that obese ( yet ) . 
  my mom is a transylvanian hungarian . 
  she hates hungarian hungarian food . 
  says it 's too oily . 
  well , slavs came from what is today ukraine & russia . 
  ( i know this is a simplified way of looking at it , but my emphasis is that antitziganism has nothing to do with indians/pakistanis/bangladeshis ), 
   also does this mean that antiziganism is actually racism against indians/pakistanis/bangladeshi ? 
  is russofobia actally racism against bulgarians/macedonians/serbs / croats ? 
   what it comes to in the end , i guess , is the following : are they or are us responsible for their present situation ? 
  probably a bit of both . 
  agreed . 
   a rural vs. urban gypsies by county map would be interesting as well . 
   the [ preliminary mother tongue results for 2011 ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ts6.pdf ) could be used to make a rural vs urban per county romany spreakers map . 
  might get around to it , but not in the near future . 
  there is no rural vs urban breakdown for ethnicity yet . 
  a map featuring percentage of gypsies who speak romany per county would be interesting . 
  i always found [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/romi_romania_media_2002.png/640px-romi_romania_media_2002.png ) interesting as it goes against the stereotype that the south is more ` gypsyfied ', 
   i am applying the exact same rule you are . 
  not really . 
  hence the \u201e bad analogy '' part . 
  tell me who uses german and nazi interchangeably ? 
  or sicilian and mafia ? 
  which dictionary defines \u201e german '' as a synonym for \u201e nazi '' ? 
   i thought that if you want to help the social advancement of a people the first step is to correct the bad behaviours associated with it , not just hide them under the rug . 
  so everyone who is a roma should be associated with all the bad connotations of the word \u201e gypsy '' ? 
  nice . 
  also , this does not exclude in any way all the other steps needed for \u201e social advancement '' . 
  they are complementary , not mutually exclusive . 
  hmmm , never thought of that . 
  i was thinking more of the gabor gypsies of north-western transylvania . 
  well , who knows . 
  this would have been funnier coming from a latvian . 
  or at least an irishman . 
   although their earlier movements can only be reconstructed from linguistic evidence . 
  afaik , linguistic evidence sugests a route as follows : india -  persia -  armenia -  byzantium -  split into vlax ( romanian-influenced ) and non-vlax dialects . 
   sneaky flair , fane, 
   where does this stop ? 
  not at bad analogies , apparently . 
   but more importantly : how does this help ? 
  how does insisting on them being called gypsies help ? 
  surely conjuring up all the bad conotations when you say somebody is \u201e a gypsy '' can not help . 
  [ yeah , must be ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=romania%2c+the+land+of+the+roma&amp;rlz=1c1avsx_enro398ro398&amp;oq=romania%2c+the+land+of+the+roma&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=18&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ), 
  it is generally considered insulting because it carries with it , beside an ethnic meaning , one about socio-economic status ( marginal low-life ) . 
  gypsy is used not only as a synonym for roma , but also for certain marginal nomadic populations that may or may not be roma ( such as irish travelers ), 
   anyway , my question was n't answered : are exonyms insulting in english ? 
  sometimes . 
   in every case , the usual term is the exonym . 
  your wording emphasized the endonym . 
   what others call us in their languages is another matter completely . 
  so , for example , they could call us gypsies ... 
   there are a lot of exonyms used in english : hungarians call themselves magyar , greeks call themselves elines , japanese call themselves nippon , and so on . 
  those are endonyms . 
  and the japanese call themselves nihonjin ( or nipponjin ) . 
   are those exonyms insulting too ? 
  there are other exonims that are considered insulting . 
  lapp is one . 
  eskimo is another ( in canada and greenland ) . 
  hottentot and bushmen yet another . 
   yes , both gypsy and vlach ( olah in hungarian ) are exonyms . 
  but i do n't think i 've ever met a fellow romanian saying he was insulted by being called wallachian . 
  but maybe we should call ourselves olah/vlah , just in case . 
  i do n't know if the romansch in switzerland like being confused with us romanians so we should change our name . 
  what do you say ? 
  first of all it depends on what you mean by \u201e racial classification '' . 
  the difference between linguistic families and races ( in the sense of similar ancestry groups ) is that you ca n't go back to a common ancestor for all languages . 
  imagine races as a hand , with asians and amerindians as one finger , extending all the way into americas , blacks as another , whites another ( to simplyfy it to the 3 main groups ) . 
  central asia is the palm . 
  with languages , you only have the fingertips , which you can box separately . 
  you have a gradual spectrum from tiera del fuego ( or iceland ) to africa , so choosing where one \u201e race '' starts and where one ends is artificial . 
  on the other hand , one language family is clearly defined from another . 
  human races is more comparable to dialect continuums . 
  so while americans group desis with white folk , because they see the whole spectrum from iceland to assam , europeans group desis as a different race because they see the difference between them and and those from south asia . 
  it 's a matter of perspective .
