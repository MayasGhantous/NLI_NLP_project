   that 's not because islamic nations lack the will , they only lack the ability . 
  is an unsuccessful murderer less bad than a successful murderer ? 
  it 's not fair to argue discrimination when you have no minority to discriminate . 
   muhammad himself slaughtered an entire tribe of jews . 
  are going down history lane now ? 
  what is r/circlebroke ? 
   most roma have a lot of european genes ; in some cases it 's hard to tell the ethnic origin ( there are even blue-eyed blonde gypsies ) ; in the case of the romanian roma , a lot of that admixture also comes from rape : romanian boyars used to keep roma women as sexual slaves . 
  what 's interesting is that i 've seen more \u201e blonde '' romas in transylvania ( where there was no slavery ) than in the south , where they seem to be on average , more dark . 
  but then again i spent more time in transylvania than in the south . 
   why are you trying to minimize the plight of the jews ? 
  i 'm not , but saying the jews have it as bad as the roma is disingenuous . 
  plus for the fact that the relationship between jews in the middle east and the islamic world is strongly shaped by international politics of the region ( i.e. 
  the israeli-palestinian conflict ) . 
  it 's not simply a problem of minority-majority relations . 
  yes , let 's take palestine as a norm for how people tend to treat jews nowadays . 
  how do you say \u201e indo-europeans go home ! '' in basque ? 
   indian is a race . 
  well , some people consider desis as part of a different race than \u201e white euro-folk '' . 
  given how artificial notions about race are , do n't be surprised that different people divide humanity up into races differently . 
   `` culturalism '' is often just a way to be ~ ~ racist ~ ~ ** xenophobic ** without ~ ~ using the r word ~ ~ ** focusing on race ** . 
  * fixed *, 
  which were notoriously unreliable . 
   you are just looking to excuse the terrible gypsy-culture . 
  and you , my friend , are pulling statements out of your ass  gypsies have an unique problem , compared to most minorities i 'm inclined to agree . 
  a unique set of problems , both internal and external . 
   that urgently needs to be addressed is not racism but an imperative , if we want to let them into our societies . 
  i 'd rather we did n't address it \u201e urgently '' , but take the time to do it intelligently . 
  gypsy history is full of ( well meaning or not ) \u201e urgent '' solutions . 
  also , it would help to not look at them as outsiders . 
  after all , we do n't like it when they look at us as outsiders , now do we ? 
   jews are discriminated against . 
  as are roma . 
  neither group is `` marginalised '' in any meaningful way . 
  this shows you have no fucking idea what you are talking about . 
  the level of discrimination between jews and roma are not even comparable . 
   except it 's not . 
  says you . 
   there 's many a roma around the world who do n't follow the culture anymore and they tend to get on just fine , integrate well , live normal healthy functional lives . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why generalizing gypsy behaviour on all the roma is retarded . 
  the article in this thread was about the genetic ancestry of the roma , not the culture of some of its members . 
  imagine if all threads about the genetic ancestry of haitians degenerated into discussions about haitian ghetto culture . 
   it 's perfectly rational to describe roma culture as problematic . 
  it 's perfectly rational to describe certain parts of roma culture * as problematic , in the general socio-economic context said culture exists in . 
  ) * roma culture is another blanket term that can encompass anything from nomad culture , traditionalism , isolationism , ghetto culture , etc. 
  gypsies did not arrive through egypt . 
  they just claimed they did to get sympathy from christian western-europeans . 
  they said they are christian refugees . 
   jews are n't . 
  where are jews marginalized today ? 
  also , ever heard of the [ kosher nostra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosher_nostra ) ? 
   many ethnic minorities are n't . 
  not all ethnic minorities are marginalized . 
   many religious minorities are n't . 
  this is not a ubiquitous problem , and to ignore the roma culture as the problem here is insane and deluded . 
  and many are . 
  there are is a complex of factors ( among others roma culture , socioeconomic factors , blatant xenofobia ) , and saying that roma culture is * the * problem is simplistic and equally insane and deluded . 
  yeah , \u201e hours spent at work '' = / = \u201e hours spent working '' . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yakuza#constituent_member  according to a 2006 speech by mitsuhiro suganuma , a former officer of the public security intelligence agency , around 60 percent of yakuza members come from burakumin , the descendants of a feudal outcast class and approximately 30 percent of them are japanese-born koreans , and only 10 per cent are from non-burakumin japanese and chinese ethnic groups . 
   the burakumin are a group that is socially discriminated against in japanese society , whose recorded history goes back to the heian period in the 11th century . 
  the burakumin are descendants of outcast communities of the pre-modern , especially the feudal era , mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or ritual impurity , such as butchers , executioners , undertakers , or leather workers . 
  they traditionally lived in their own secluded hamlets . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burakumin  burakumin ( \u90e8\u843d\u6c11 ? , `` hamlet people '' / `` village people '' ) were originally members of outcast communities in the japanese feudal era , composed of those with occupations considered impure or tainted by death ( such as executioners , undertakers , workers in slaughterhouses , butchers or tanners ) , which have severe social stigmas of kegare ( \u7a62\u308c or `` defilement '' ) attached to them . 
  traditionally , the burakumin lived in their own hamlets or ghettos . 
  as a social minority the burakumin have been discriminated against . 
  the burakumin are basically japan 's version of the gypsies , minus the ethnic difference, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_romani_people#tsigani.2c_cig.c3.a1ny  the name originates with byzantine greek \u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( atsinganoi , latin adsincani ) or \u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( athinganoi , literally `` untouchables '' ) , a term applied to the sect of the melchisedechians . 
   in real life 99 % of the cases the real problem people have with them is violent aggression , not stealing . 
  you are very hungarian-centric about this . 
  the fact that the no . 
  1 problem in hungary is violence ( at least that 's how it 's perceived ) , does not mean that that 's everybody 's problem . 
  go check out the / r/worldnews thread . 
  most people talk about pickpocketing at least as much as about violence . 
  any marginal ( ized ) more likely to be criminal than most non-marginal groups . 
   that gypsies that live in greece have a genetic link to egypt rather then india . 
  . but it is hard to say . 
  it could be both . 
  actually the name gypsy comes from the myth that they were christian refugees from egypt . 
  they used the story while travelling through medieval europe . 
  * olah, 
  the fact that they were of indian origin was a known fact ( linguistics pointed that way a long time ago and genetics confirmed it later ) . 
  what this study shows is the social strata ( cast ) they come from . 
  there has been some debate up until now whether they come from the dalit ( `` untouchable '' ) cast or not . 
  i eat it with ketchup and by hand ( mostly ) . 
  there might be a belgian bias in this thread ... 
  there 's also a ukrainian road that passes a couple of kilometers through moldova . 
  chancelor of the union ( unionskanzler ) has a nice , germano-centric ring to it , 
  we need a new name to distinguish barroso 's post from rompuy 's post . 
  president of the comission and president of the council are too damn simmilar in name . 
  let 's just call the first one chief-comissioner or something .

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_transylvania#historical_population census of 1850 ( transylvania proper only ) : romanians-59 .1 % census of 1869 romanians-59 .0 % not that much higher , but it fluctuated more between the two . 
  not just because o assimilation , but also because of different methods of counting . 
  the one based on mother tongue counted jews as either hungarians if hungarian speaking , or as germans if yiddish speaking ( of jewish faith ) . 
  then , the further you go back in time the less reliable the info , and the more ideologically biased the \u201e estimates '' . 
   unfortunately , as the time went by , the hungarians made the situation even worse and ultimately they made a futile attempt to completely assimilate the romanians ( and other so called minorities such as slovaks ) towards the end of 19th century . 
  again this did not go well with romanians which by this time constituted 75 % of the population of transylvania . 
  according to the census conducted in 1920 , the romanian population was 57,3 % of the population . 
  it 's around 75 % today .
