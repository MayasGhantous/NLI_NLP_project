  actually non of the borders were fair , ethnically speaking . 
  but some areas with hungarian majorities were awarded to romania for more pragmatic reasons . 
  a just ethnic border would have created a szekely enclave in the middle of romania . 
  yellow is for people who * abstained * ( were present , but did not vote ) . 
  light blue is for people who were * absent * ( were not even present there to vote ) .

  a friend visited the [ z\u0103rne\u0219ti bear sanctuary ] ( http://zarnesti.net/en/useful-information/bear-sanctuary/ ) last summer and came back with absolutely heartbreaking stories . 
  does it matter ? 
  your comment was a blanket criticism of identity politics in general and the idea that specific ethnic ( and religious ) groups have specific interests . 
  you say that  * it implies that there are some inherent differences between different ethnicities * but i would say it implies no such thing . 
  the premise is not an inherent difference , but one within society , arising through social interaction influenced by various objective ( level of wealth and education of one group or another ) and subjective things ( societal prejudice and whatnot ) . 
  i would argue that \u201e identity politics '' starts from the premise that there is no inherent difference , but there is one in society , which should be corrected . 
  with historical minorities shit gets even more complicated . 
   ( the main hungarian party is [ udmr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_union_of_hungarians_in_romania ) , if you eanna read the wikipage . ), 
  heads up : i edited my previous post in case you missed it . 
  what do you make of ethnic minorities that vote for ethnic parties ( hungarians in romania and slovakia , turks in bulgaria ) ? 
   whereas in relation to almost every policy area of government , the interests of individuals are unconnected to their `` identity '' but instead are connected to their individualism . 
  i think this is where you make an assumption . 
  i think individuals can have interests connected to their \u201e identity '' . 
  and many do . 
  actually , the architectural equivalent of socialist realism is [ stalinist classicism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalinist_architecture ) . 
  the communist block of flats would be more of a [ brutalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) lite kinda style . 
  / architecture pedant, 
  maybe because it resembles the romanian word for old - \u201e vechi '' . 
   as `` pazar '' is turkish loanword for market . 
  many will recognize it in the form * \u201e bazar '' *, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nguyen  nguy\u1ec5n is the most common vietnamese family name . 
  [ ... ] by some estimates , forty percent of vietnamese people have this surname . 
  [ ... ]  many events in vietnamese history have contributed to the name 's prominence . 
  in 1232 , after usurping the l\u00fd dynasty , tr\u1ea7n th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ed9 forced the descendants of the l\u00fd to change their surname to nguy\u1ec5n . 
  when h\u1ed3 qu\u00fd ly overturned the tr\u1ea7n dynasty , he killed many of their descendants so when the h\u1ed3 dynasty collapsed in 1407 , many of his descendants changed their surname to nguy\u1ec5n in fear of retribution . 
  in 1592 , on the collapse of the m\u1ea1c dynasty , their descendants changed their surname to nguy\u1ec5n . 
  when the nguy\u1ec5n dynasty ( the descendants of the nguy\u1ec5n lords ) took power in 1802 , some of the descendants of the tr\u1ecbnh lords fearing retribution changed their surname to nguy\u1ec5n , while others fled north into china . 
  the nguy\u1ec5n dynasty awarded many people the surname nguy\u1ec5n during their rule , and many criminals also changed their surname to nguy\u1ec5n to avoid prosecution . 
  as with other common surnames , people having this surname are not necessarily related . 
   bistri\u021ba in romanian , a slavic word meaning quick and used exclusively for rivers and creeks . 
  this is a bit incorrect , given that there are several settlements named bistri\u021ba, 
  but there are some [ gr\u0103di\u0219te ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c4%83di%c8%99tea ) here and there . 
  sorbia, 
  none in romania i 'm afraid . 
  i got ta look up how many settlements we have with the \u201e - grad '' ending . 
  i know of [ moigrad ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/moigrad-porolissum,_s%c4%83laj ) and i know alba-iulia used to be called [ b\u0103lgrad ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/alba_iulia ) , but that 's about it . 
  also salt . 
  lots of salt ... 
  well , i guess a good place to build a city remains a good place to build a city many centuries later as well . 
   most people 35 + grew up in that atmosphere . 
  that being said , a lot of `` under 35 `` s from my facebook feed displayed similar levels of paranoia . 
  fun fact : covaci also means smith , 
  some of them have crossed the mediteranean . 
  that coupled with the fact that smuggling is not a foreign sport in the balkans leads me to think they will manage to somehow overcome them rivers . 
  and my aks !, 
  so you mean the buddhists were nazis before the nazis ? 
  partial . 
  metro came once every 15 minutes instead of usual 5 . 
  well , [ he does like swastikas ] ( https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dalai-lama-with-swastikas.jpg ) ... 
  can confirm . 
  visited paris in 2007 or 2008 ( do n't remember exactly ) and we had a metro strike on our last day . 
  we had to catch the bus to beauvais , and nobody could tell us the evening before what the strike meant ( total shutdown or just partial ? ) . 
  that raised some pulses  otoh , we had no trouble with the language . 
  hell , unlike the stereotype , almost all parisians ware nice and friendly . 
  you knew when you voted in the european parliamentary elections as well . 
  the parties were very clear about it and the spitzencandidate process as well . 
  people who paid attention knew that if the epp became the biggest party in the euparl , then juncker would get first nomination of comission-president . 
  romanian \u201e ora\u0219 '' ( town/city ) also comes from hungarian \u201e v\u00e1ros '' . 
  yes . 
  how about we let the saudis build them and than just give them all to sufis ? 
  i kinda miss the occasional presidential trolling . 
  kinda ... 
  it 's safe , do n't worry . 
  i used to be a mod . 
  the overwhelming majority were far-righters . 
  also , did n't a lot of banned users ( overwhelming majority of wom were far-right ) get unbanned recently ? 
  what interesting paralels do you find in how india and europe see themselves ? 
  also what notable differences iyo ? 
  do n't forget \u201e rapists '' ... 
  i wholeheartedly agree !, 
   lisbon problem sounds like athens as well ... 
  in romany ... 
  admit it . 
  you piss sitting down , do n't you ? 
  typical leftist !, 
  i 'm not talking about all the people here , but about some of the pro-independence-catalans . 
  there are many annoying things in this subreddit . 
  sometimes , the catalan independist circlejerk is annoying as fuck . 
  ( and i fully support self-determination and all that jazz ) . 
  given how subjective the whole race thing is , i would n't be surprised if some people consider middle-easterners different racially from white-europeans . 
  although , many saudis ( probably the southern ones ) look quite distinct from syrians , even though they are both \u201e arabs '' . 
  nice or avignon , not sure yet . 
  or maybe neither . 
  there is an element of uncertainty . 
  my wife has some job offers , but until she talks face-to-face we do n't know for sure . 
  the drive was long , but good in the sense that it was mostly on the highway . 
  i got back home at 5 am , and i just woke up and i 'm still a bit dizzy . 
  stressed . 
  lots of things to do . 
  planning to move to france come september , and there is still paperwork to sort out , a portfolio to finish ( cause i need a job too ) , and my wife 's grandpa just had a small stroke last week , so that added to the mix . 
  also , i have to drive to budapest and back tonight to pick my wife 's sister up from the airport , after her year of erasmusing . 
  also , autumn has just arrived and the scorching heat i love so much is over . 
  but all in all i 'm a big mix of excited and anxious . 
  you da mvp !,
