   truth be told , as much as love germany , i think in my case the other country would perhaps give a bigger shit about me than germany . 
  i guess that could count as a benefit . 
  interesting . 
  what makes you say that ? 
   imo , it mostly focuses on '' foreign '' passports aka middle-east/muslim and not so much on '' western '' passports . 
  depends . 
  there is some controversy about russian giving out passports in certain breakaway states ( transnistria , south ossetia , abkhazia ) and there was some scandal about hungary giving out citizenship to ethnic hungarians in neighbouring states very easily . 
  slovakia revokes citizenship to anyone who takes up such a hungarian citizenship iirc . 
  it would probably been much more controversial in romania too , except for the fact that we are giving out citizenship equally eagerly to moldovans ( plus there is the fact that the constitution states that romanian citizenship acquired by birth can not be revoked ) . 
  i do n't know how to read this ... 
  i was surprised he did n't turn out to be of [ adjaran origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adjara#population ) . 
  either that , or they 'll say it was cameron 's push that de-arch-federalized him . 
  it 's called a `` beep '' in romanian ( written `` bip '' ) , and the action is `` to give a beep '' ( romanian : `` a da un bip '' ) . 
  it 's actually not uncommon to think that one 's word for longing is , like , so much deeper than everyone else 's . 
  we say the same bullshit about `` dor '' , the romanian translation of saudade . 
   most voters in the european elections voted for right wing parties . 
  another way of looking at it would be : * most voters in the european elections voted for centrist europhile parties ( parties that went on to form a coalition , same as in every other democracy ) . 
   the way i understand it , stuff like moron in the heat of the moment and in a post that actually includes some discussion points is frowned upon , but tolerated . 
  actually , comments containing personal attacks are removed and the user asked to edit them out , and only then reapproved . 
  too many conversations have just derailed into personal attacks because at the end of a post someone wrote a `` you moron '' . 
  he was also the target of the [ rose revolution in late 2003 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rose_revolution ) which was basically the georgian version of the `` orange revolution '' that brought saakashvili to power . 
  while that is shitty comment that warrants removal ( i left it now for the sake of this conversation ) , it 's still not proof of him being a / r/whiterights poster ( which is indeed a serious thing ) . 
  it would be best if these accusations were backed up ( i could n't find any evidence in the last ~ 1000 comments he made , which are roughly within the last month ) . 
  also your comment tends to fall within the bounds of ** rule # 2 ** `` personal attacks that add nothing to the conversation '', 
   / u/the _ viper is racist and posts in / r/whiterights could you back this up please with a link ? 
   more advanced suggestions would be to draft juries to make decisions in particular cases this is a good idea , and it does work in the desired direction of more communication with the community . 
   i feel this is a real struggle . 
  honest moderating is a thankless and hard job ( like a janitor ) this is why i feel that `` elections '' should not be the only factor , and i think that the last moderatorial expansion was good ( combining elections with more technocratic appointments ) . 
  for example , spam detection/removal is really technical and something independent of public opinion . 
   otherwise , the only thing you can do is detect the raids in an ad-hoc manner and do your best to ban the offending users . 
  that is the current state of afairs, 
  super . 
  i 'm here now , back home . 
  i 'll start looking over the feedback in the post . 
   there is also some sort of sausage [ 2 ] called ` polonez ' we have `` polonez '' too , but ours [ is a bit different ] ( http://aphextwinz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/slide117.jpg ), 
   do you have time to be online and help me answer questions that are coming up ? 
  yeah . 
  i 'll be home after 15:30 gmt , but might leave later for a couple of hours ( 18:00 -20:00 gmt ) . 
  but other than that , yeah , i 'll be online, 
   and include every single moderator action over the time span of six months between 01 . 
  january and 29 . 
  june 2014 . 
  from what i can tell , the tool actually only recorded moderator actions from roughly the last 3 months . 
  i asked for info from january and february and it did n't return anything . 
   1 ) to remind you about our rules and guidelines and how they are enforced maybe something like `` and to receive feedback on how they can be improved/more efficiently enforced '' something along these lines . 
  i want it to feel more comunity-friendly and less top-down . 
   they did n't even make it in the romanian parliament in the last 10 years . 
  they were voted out in 2008 . 
   superiority complex ( similar to what / u/perseus0807 [ 1 ] said about india : `` greek culture    any other culture '' ) ye old \u201e everything comes from the greeks '' , 
  setting up a precedent . 
  giving up transnistria means that armed separatism is a reasonable way of achieving ones aims in moldova . 
  moldova considers the separatist regime illegal , so recognizing it gives it legality , and furthermore , it could , they fear , spark some similar shit in g\u0103g\u0103uzia . 
  most are not russians , but the population is 1/3 russians , 1/3 ukrainians and 1/3 moldovans . 
  so the moldovans are a minority , but they are a big % of the population , so chi\u0219in\u0103u does not want to abandon them because it looks bad politically . 
  the defacto borders of transnistrian republic do not overlap exactly over the de jure ones . 
  transnistria controls tighina , which is in moldova proper , and chi\u0219in\u0103u controls some areas in the middle of transnistria . 
  tiraspol does not want to give up tighina because it 's close to tiraspol and is majority slav city . 
  moldova does n't want to give it up because it 's on the right bank of the dniester , and they do n't want them ( transnistria and the russians generally ) to have a foothold on the right side . 
  not sure if you consider them good reasons , but i think these are the main reasons . 
   also cinemas wont have dubbing/subs in russian anymore and it will be replaced with romanian what was the situation of cinemas until now ? 
  does this ruling apply in g\u0103g\u0103uzia as well ? 
  i ca n't say this is a good move tbh . 
  how many russian channels are not banned ? 
  how big of a share did rossiya24 have in the russophone sector in moldova ? 
  i fill like i 'm missing quite a bit of context here . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_day_%28belarus%29  the decision to celebrate independence day on july 3 , the day of the liberation of belarus from the nazis , was made during the 1996 national referendum proposed by president alexander lukashenko . 
  interesting collection of pics . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fur_people  the fur ( fur : f\u00f2\u00f2r\u00e0 , arabic : \u0641\u0648\u0631 f\u016br ) are an ethnic group from western sudan , principally inhabiting the region of darfur where they are the largest tribe .

   oltenia : poor , lazy , dirty and stupid . 
  honorable mention : the city of caracal ( where the cart full of stupid people fell over ), 
   how did you avoid the ban from / r/europe ? 
  you told me all greeks deserved to die in the greek genocide . 
  yeah , i 'm surprised as well , but i corrected that mistake . 
  also , i 'll take this opportunity to remind you ( and others here ) to keep a civil tone . 
  '' [ and you are lynching negroes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) '', 
   but we 're quite confident good friend romania will soon ratify as well !, 
  politicians said they want us to be the first to ratify it , and that it 's gon na be done this week . 
  * eu pressure to tackle corruption has meant that corrupt politicians are being investigated and locked up like crazy . 
  this was unthinkable 10 years ago . 
  ( check out our weekly news roundup ) * the fact that generally our political class is under close scrutiny by western politicians ( not saying those guys are perfect , but they are of superior quality to our home brand ) * eu funds - it 's helping develop the country like never before ( infrastructure , historical buildings renovations , funds for agriculture , funds for new businesses ) . 
  as an architect , many of the projects i worked on in the crisis period were on eu funds . 
  * access to the single market , which means our businesses have the potential to grow way beyond what our national market could have offered . 
  * freedom to travel and work abroad , which mean both an end to our half-century of isolation and the possibility of self-development abroad ( erasmus , work abroad ) . 
  i have traveled a lot , and still remember being denied schengen visa . 
  now all i need is an id card , and i 'm held up at the border for maximum 2 minutes . 
  also , i plan to live/work in western europe in the future , and that 's way more easy than it used to be . 
  * the symbolic aspect of being in the `` european family '' once again . 
  you have no idea how much this means to us after being trapped behind the iron curtain for half a century . 
  * this is off the top of my head . 
  maybe others can add more *,
