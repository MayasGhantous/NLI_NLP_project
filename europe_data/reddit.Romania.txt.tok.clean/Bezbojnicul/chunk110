  imo , the [ odessa massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_odessa_massacre ), 
  / r/arabs did it manually ( i asked them ) . 
  the idea of implementing two flairs is n't new . 
  i thought about doing it back when i was responsible for the flairs , but there was no easy ( automatic ) way to implement it , and doing it manually is crazy . 
  so unless the admins changed some things , it 's still extremely difficult . 
  cc / u/reilly616, 
  * george soros ( hungarian jew !!!, 
  ) / alternatively petre roman ( of jewish origin ) invented the name `` rroma '' in 1990 so that people will confuse romanians with gypsies * ceausescu used blood transfusions of young blood to stay young * ceausescu defeated a russian invasion with a super secret laser that could melt tanks * the psd ( center-left ) is secretly working for russia, 
  territorial disputes until ww2 ended . 
   there is a slavic element , for instance in palatalizing d , t , n before e , i. 
  that is also virtually identical to the gy , ty , ny sounds found in hungarian . 
  also , coloquially , it would be :  * nu-i greu . 
  * which is from the inherited vulgar latin , not 19 ^ th century borrowing . 
  amen , brother !, 
  also , the thing with snoop dogg ... 
  i kinda like it ...

  to be fair , most people use \u201e siberia '' to mean anything east of the urals . 
  because of shared history and culture . 
   one of the perks of being a rhnegative basque . 
  what does rh have to do with it ( ccr5-\u039432 mutation ) ? 
  i ask as an rh-negative non-basque, 
  it 's entirely possible . 
  imagine [ 19 ` th century greater hungary 's ethnic distribution . ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/hungary-ethnic_groups.jpg ) . 
  at that time , hungarians were around 40 % ( iirc ) of the population . 
  now imagine imagine if the parts that make up today 's hungary had double the population . 
  than that would make hungarians over 50 % of greater hungary , even if large parts of the perifery were majority non-hungarian . 
  that 's basically what it 's meant when people say \u201e hungarians were majority in the carpathian basin '' ( * carpathian basin * is greater hungary , bound on all sides by mountains , not just transylvania ) . 
  now if you notice , [ the ottoman invasion ] ( http://cms.sulinet.hu/get/d/499d0a96-53c8-4764-8c2c-65b8fc3c0413/1/4/b/large/13_00n.jpg ) basically fucked up and depopulated the central parts of greater hungary , the parts that are majority hungarian , leading to a shift in the percentage of ethnic hungarians in the total population of greater hungary . 
  * disclamer : * while this scenario seems very plausible , i have not really studied the problem in detail . 
   budai nagy antal revolt or \u201e bob\u00e2lna uprising '' , as we know it . 
   of course not all 64k live in bucharest but i imagine most of them would do . 
  wrong . 
  only 14 % of romanian muslims live in bucharest . 
  16 % if you count ilfov county as well , which is basically the suburbs of bucharest . 
  on the other hand , 72.3 % of muslims live in [ dobrudja ] ( http://www.descopera.org/wp-content/uploads/harta-dobrogea.jpg ) . 
  do you think that there are no mosques in romania ? 
  do you think there are no mosques in bucharest ? 
  do you think all 64k muslims live in bucharest ? 
  because that is what you are implying . 
  which is very different from the statement that there might not be enough mosques to service all the muslims living there . 
  which is probably true . 
  [ some very nice designs here ] ( http://architizer.com/blog/8-modern-mosques/ ) . 
  we actually have a pretty good relationship with turkey , probably because ottoman domination was indirect , through local princes . 
  it was actually illegal to build mosques in wallachia , moldova and transylvania , and the only places with mosques were dobrudja ( under direct ottoman rule ) and the cities that were [ rayah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raya_ ( country_subdivision \\ ) ) ( but those were later abolished and some [ turned into churches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_holy_archangels_michael_and_gabriel,_br%c4%83ila ) ), 
  the mosque would be under the control of the romanian muftiate , which is headed by a moderate local . 
  the danger here is the saudi and qatari funded groups , which the mufti has warned against ( as evidenced in the wikileaks ) . 
  out of 27698 turks in romania , only 795 ( 2,9 % ) arent muslim . 
  according to the census : ~ 9041 muslims in bucharest of which : * 2607 romanians * 2163 turks * 376 tatars * 201 ( info unavailable ) * the rest , 3694 , of other ethnicities ( mostly , i believe , arabs ), 
   while i 'm against the idea of a turkish government funded mosque in romania ( even though there are 30000 turks in romania the turkish villages/towns in romania already have mosques . 
  this is more for the bucharest muslims whom i bet are mostly arabs . 
  i 'm all for building a mosque in bucharest under the romanian muftiat ( moderate ) , because otherwise informal , conservative mosques would take their place . 
  although i do question the size ( media said it would be the biggest in europe/eastern europe ? ) . 
  also i do n't like the romanian state giving away land and money to religious organisations . 
  cool . 
  x-post to / r/mapporn for extra karma . 
  i think the flag is a failed rendition of the [ andalusian flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/flag_of_andaluc%c3%ada.svg/500px-flag_of_andaluc%c3%ada.svg.png ), 
  very relevant : [ difference between `` trust '' , respectively `` distrust '' , in national vs. european parliament ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/20zcr9/difference_between_trust_respectively_distrust_in/ ), 
  i had no idea . 
  i spent my honeymoon in turkey ( istambul + bursa + edirne ) . 
  we wanted to see more than just istambul , so we thought that edirne and bursa , being close and former ottoman capitals as well , would make the most interesting places to visit . 
  ( we were right ) . 
  fun fact : \u201e karag\u00f6z '' actually entered the romanian vocabulary as an adjectiv ( \u201e caraghios '' ) meaning \u201e funny/foolish '' . 
  no , why ? 
  ( some are from our travels , some are gifts from relatives ), 
  * white ribbon flashbacks *, 
   they have a representative in the parliament . 
  not just them . 
  the bulgarian minority , which includes all the bulgarians of romania , although the banat bulgarians are the largest chuck of that minority . 
  id 's say bayash is the most distinctive of the daco-romanian dialects . 
  i 'd argue that it 's enough . 
  regionalism are part of what makes a dialect a dialect . 
  there are also [ other elements ( phonetic , etc ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana_dialect#particularities ) that add to the distinction . 
  romanian nationalism is very \u201e unity-centered '' . 
  our national day is \u201e union day '' and regionalism is kinda suspiciously looked upon . 
  there is less dialectal variation and less regional pride compared to the netherlands . 
   there are always dialects . 
  there are , but there are some interconnected myths about how romanian dialectal variation is not actually dialect , but \u201e sub-dialect '' and so on . 
  people will bend over backwards to prove that any internal variation within romanian is not enough to qualify them as dialects . 
  sure , our internal dialects might not be as divergent as other languages , but it 's still varied enough to make the \u201e romanian has only one dialect '' thing be kinda bs . 
  also , jan hus . 
   christianity - orthodox , greek-catholic , catholic , lutheranism , calvinism and more recently american neo-protestantism . 
  also the birthplace of unitarianism . 
  czechia is perfectly valid english form , and it is simmilar to how the country is called in other languages . 
  so , translation for other confused people such as myself :  basque flag displayed on balcony of city council of pamplona , capital of navarra , at the inauguration of the [ san fermin festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_ferm%c3%adn ) .

  as in \u201e romania '' . 
   but what i 've seen a lot over the last years is greek people acting like they 're literally one step below the congo in terms of living standards and , of course , that 's not their fault at all . 
  not even partially . 
  it 's easy for me to ignore such comments here in germany . 
  but i can understand that for somebody in a country with an even worse economy , those comment are infuriating .
