  laughter is also a frequent reaction here to the suggestion \u201e greeks are poor '' . 
  interesting you bring up the rules , given that there is no rule that states that english is the official language of / r/europe . 
  this is not an `` english subreddit '' . 
  it 's a `` european subreddit where most people speak english as a lingua franca '' but there is no ban against other languages , and there are times when discussions branch off in other languages . 
  given the political climate of macedoania , they are still many many years away from membership .

  the hellenisters always pay their debts ... 
  from the guardian 's live feed :  the euro has just plunged at the start of trading in asia , as the financial markets finally get an opportunity to react to the last 48 hours . 
  the single currency immediately fell 1.5 % to $ 1.101 , down from $ 1.116 on friday evening . 
  two nights ago , traders though that saturday was going to yield a short-term bailout extension for greece .

  i upvoted the article , because it 's an interesting and little known piece of history , but your description of the events is unpleasant to say the least . 
  * i say , jolly good comment old chap !,

  we have come full circle : [ original / r/europe thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vxn36/share_of_young_people_2534_living_with_parents/ ) ** including croatia ** : [ green/red version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/388h2zx.png ) and [ colorblind version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehef99r.png ) also : [ five year change ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vj6luoy.png ) * ( in percentage points ) * + [ colorblind version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qvvdxgg.png ), 
  [ here is the context of that quote ] ( https://youtu.be/ukww28mcv0c?t=3m17s ) . 
  it has nothing to do with the migration quota affair . 
  it 's a general statement on migration ( that it 's a positive thing ) . 
  the romanian article lumps two quotes from the interview together that are separated by quite a lot of text . 
  saying ponta agrees with the quota based on this interview is a huge stretch ( if not an outright lie ) . 
  could i get a source on that ? 
  * this is so far the official position , so romania is where it should be . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.derekbacon.com/derek_bacon_syria.jpg ) is my favourite , even though it 's heartbreaking . 
  reminds me of [ black abkhazians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abkhazians_of_african_descent ) . 
  when you 're far-right , everybody is to your left ... 
   is that a rule ? 
  no , but it could fall under 2.5 , or 4.1 , depending on circumstance . 
  yes . 
  spain and italy are our 2 biggest target-countries , especially for low-skilled emmigrants ( fruit-picking , construction , babysitting , etc ) , at least until the crisis . 
   vetoes the legal comite gives a non-binding opinion that the mps can choose to ignore in the final vote . 
  \u201e veto '' implies a binding decision . 
  rome was closer to bucharest in terms of cleanliness and less what i expected of a \u201e western european capital '' . 
  * ( this was in 2003 ) *, 
  yep . 
  no bucharest ? 
  * inb4 * circular logic by which a roma stops being a roma when he becomes a programmer, 
  the overwhelming majority of roma are n't nomadic . 
  communism took care of those that were , and even before that , only some of them were . 
  this is one of those soundbites that go in a super-simplified narrative of `` why we hate the roma '' . 
  the pro-circlejerk , or the anti-circle-jerk ? 
   but it would have been complicated diplomatically . 
  as well as economically . 
  that really would n't have been viable without the cooperation of romania , which i doubt could have been achieved . 
  the most possible would have been a sort of autonomy , but given the ideological atmosphere of the time , i doubt that too . 
   the villages around tham were predominantly romanian the vilages to the west and north of oradea are still predominantly hungarian . 
  basically all the way up to satu mare county . 
  the four villages that i know of being majority romanian west of carei are all post-wwi colonies ( mo\u021bi from the apuseni mts . ) . 
  i know of them because my wife 's grandparents live in the area . 
   with no regards to other factors ? 
  i think that factoring in only that which was advantageous for romanians and the romanian state ( in our case ) , while ignoring the right of self-determination of the borderland hungarians was wrong and short-sighted , even if it was within the rights of the winning side . 
   i would hope that most people would agree that these areas should have had the option to choose . 
  i think a [ schleswig-holstein-type referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schleswig_plebiscites,_1920#plebiscite_voting_and_results ) would have ensured a much more peaceful post-wwi atmosphere around hungary . 
   however , do you believe that connecting szeklerland to proper hungary was viable ? 
  until at least the late 20th century , having a szekler exclave for hungary was unviable . 
   do you think this is how the border should have looked after trianon ? 
  that is unfair towards the romanians inbetween , as well as towards the rusyns/ukrainians in zakarpatia and serbs in parts of vojvodina . 
   i mean the whole transilvania i do n't . 
  southern slovakia , north-western romania , northern vojvodina and szeklerland are all places where you can carve out hungarian majority areas . 
  `` if we ignore hungarian-majority regions , we can can safely say there are no hungarian-majority regions '', 
   i believe because existing administrative regions were used nope . 
  [ modern hungary superimposed over old administrative divisions ] ( http://www.napig.sk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/varmegyek-nagyobb.jpg ) . 
  the logic was ethnic + strategic . 
  * ethnic - include as many slovaks/romanians/serbo-croats as possible * strategic - include acces to danube ( also useful as natural border ) in the case of slovakia , or include transport infrastructure - in the case of [ western romania ] ( http://www.alkotmanyossagi-muhely.hu/2004_e1.gif ), 
  following that logic , yes . 
   and a minority in every other region . 
  depends how you draw the regions . 
   magyars actually came in the 7th century ad so it 's actually worst !, 
  it 's not in any way * worse * , given that the hungarians of today are the descendants of the local population that adopted the hungarian language . 
  so they did n't appear in the 9 ^ th century , they are as native as the rest . 
  only their language is more recent . 
  the hungarians that came , came in the 9 ^ th century , not 7 ^ th , read your links before opening your mouth . 
   and this relates to your claims how ? 
  it relates to the claim that hungarians are somehow immigrants while the people around are super-duper native . 
  which is bullshit . 
  saying that the hungarian conquest is immigration while the proto-indo-european invasion is not is just cherry-picking a cut-off point to suit your nationalistic agenda . 
  such an unexpected turn of events ... 
  yes , we 're also filthy rich when compared to eritrea . 
   in our case they are not majority next to the border . 
  pathetic lie . 
  all the communes [ displayed in various shades of blue on this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/maghiarii_din_romania_%282002%29.png ) are majority hungarian . 
  of course , if you want to be dishonest , you choose higher level administrative units . 
  i 'd suggest using development regions , so you can claim that hungarians are n't a majority anywhere . 
  for starters , the * proto-indo-europeans came to the carpathian basin around 3000bc . 
  by that time the entire area already had a native population of pre-indo-european descent . 
  -- for starters , the * homo sapiens * came to europe around 40000bc . 
  by that time the entire area already had a native population of * neanderthalian * descent . 
  just to show how ignorant you are when it comes to history , the huns have nothing to do with the hungarians . 
  your post belongs in / r/badhistory, 
  thank you . 
  i 'm sorry to go , but , time to move on i guess . 
  thank you , 
  i do n't have time to mod , and i ca n't represent the mod team , because i disagree with the general direction of the mod-team . 
  as such , i can not continue to make use of my privileges as moderator . 
  however , since i started writing this reply , i 'm gon na detail some of my thoughts on some of the criticism here : * i think there is nothing wrong with having an american moderator ( or non-european one in general ) . 
  sometimes trolls come out when europe sleeps , and it 's good to have a mod on different time zone * albeit somewhat radical , / u/crnaruka seems like a pleasant conversation partner . 
  i think that technically he has what it takes to be a moderator , but i still voted against his nomination , because ... * i do n't think controversial users should be mods . 
  not because they ca n't mod , but because it paints a giant bullseye on the modteam as a whole , and opens `` us '' up for easy criticism and red-hering-ing . 
  and i do n't think public support is to be neglected . 
  * davidreiss has been spot on many times when it came to smelling out spam and brigading ( and yes , there is brigading ) and hes not really some mini-stalin some people try to paint him . 
  there are other aspects that bother me , like the fact that he does n't quit in order to spare the other mods of having to prop him up .
