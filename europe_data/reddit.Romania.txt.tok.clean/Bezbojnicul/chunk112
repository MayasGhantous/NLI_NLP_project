  i do n't really care about the drama from / r/canada or whatever . 
  even if the accusations are bullshit ( and they may very well be as far as i 'm concerned ) , it still has a negative effect on others . 
  that 's all i can think of right now , but there is probably more . 
  it 's 2:00 am and my clock rings at 5:40 tomorrow . 
  yes . 
  this ha thoroughly been debunked over at / r/linguistics, 
  here you go  http://www.ziare.com/cultura/documentar/un-roman-extraterestru-starneste-furtuna-intre-romania-si-serbia-1158748, 
  how wonderfully paternalistic ... ( you know there are many kinds of autonomy besides full fiscal one , right ? 
  like you can have political autonomy without fiscal autonomy . 
  examples abound . ), 
   those people were slavs too :  nikola tesla not according to some romanian nationalists . 
   that ` s the future of szekelyland right there if they ever get autonomy . 
  you 're conflating autonomy with independence . 
   polish orthodox christians what 's the deal with them ? 
  are they poles who converted or belarusians who adopted the polish language / polish identity ? 
  greater hungary was used because there is little correlation in bukovina , so using austria-hungary woul n't be such a great match ( bukovina was under the austrians for a century and a half , transylvania and banat were under a hungarian or german elite for roughly 9 centuries ) . 
  greater hungary was just the final embodiment of what i wanted to show , and also it made a nice parallel to the \u201e german empire '' form in the polish map . 
  he means [ this pattern ] ( https://arnoldplaton.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/ungaria-mare-si-prezidentialele-romane/ ), 
  interesting . 
  til ( about the battle not happening . 
  i knew abut the edict of turda ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c8%98umuleu_ciuc#pentecost_pilgrimage  cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 became a pilgrimage site in 1567 , when hungarian king john ii sigismund z\u00e1polya wanted to convert the sz\u00e9kely population of the upper cs\u00edk to protestantism . 
  the sz\u00e9kelys refused to abandon the catholic faith and resisted . 
  a battle took place on a nearby field , on saturday before pentecost 1567 , from which the sz\u00e9kelys emerged victorious . 
  the monks saw this as a sign of the care of virgin mary , and since then , this event has been commemorated by a pilgrimage when the believers gather on pentecost every year . 
  beside its religious importance , the pilgrimage has also become a community event demonstrating spiritual unity of hungarian people living in and outside the historical region of transylvania . 
   as the szekelys remained roman catholics after the reformation many szekelys ( in the western parts of szeklerland ) are [ reformed ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/reformati_romania_%282002%29.png/640px-reformati_romania_%282002%29.png ) and [ unitarian ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/unitarieni_romania_%282002%29.png/640px-unitarieni_romania_%282002%29.png ) . 
   'd guess that moldova would unite with romania after ceding transnistria in exchange for budjak . 
  nobody really cares about [ the budjak ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/bugeac-etnic.png ) , and i doubt we would make any teritorial demands on ukraine tbh . 
  but if there were territorial demands , they 'd be over parts of [ northern bukovina ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/bucovina-ethnic.png ) before anything else . 
  the only ones that stand out a bit are some sections of the tatar population which have more asiatic features . 
  like the grand mufti , [ murad yusuf ] ( http://www.ctonline.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/iusuf-murat-muftiu.jpg ) . 
   but it suggests to me that perhaps romanians are n't as turcophobic as others . 
  well , because wallachia , moldavia and tranylvania had internal autonomy an no direct ottoman administration ( except some small areas ) or turkish settlement ( mosques were n't allowed in these principalities ) , there is no minority to hate . 
  also the one doing the exploitation on the ground was the local elite , not the ottoman elite . 
  so the indirectness helped . 
  and after bulgarian independence , good relations with the turko-tatar minority in dobruja was a way to fight off bulgarian nationalist claims on the area , which were a more imediate danger . 
   anybody want to `` remember '' this every year ? 
  sure , why not . 
   and this ex minister is her father-in-law if i understood correctly . 
  something like [ groomsman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groomsman ) * ( ro : na\u0219 de cununie ) *, 
   sandzak of tuna wiki : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube_vilayet, 
  otoh , while on vacation in turkey last year i met a saudi ( also on vacation ) who claimed ancestry from romania , sttrangely enough , as well as two turks whos spoke romanian quite well ( one mentioned doing some commerce in the 90 's in romania ) . 
   the romanian/aromanian communities grew faster ; also this region was sparsely populated pre-1900s . 
  there was also a state policy of colonisation , but no ethnic cleansing or anything . 
  the english wikipedia article is quite good on the subject : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_tatars_in_romania, 
   according to turkish wikipedia they are an offshoot of the crimean tatars . 
  actually they are a mix of crimean and an earlier wave of nogay ( i think ) tatars . 
   after the huns not really . 
  it was a happy concidence , but the name is after some turkic confederacy ( the `` onogur '' ) and it got an h some time in the middle ages . 
  trianon is no joke . 
  not really ... 
  yes . 
  born in 1986 . 
   no , it has n't shifted . 
  yes it has . 
  another example : http://mic.com/articles/107686/why-you-shouldn-t-call-poor-nations-third-world-countries  in the post-cold war environment , third world became a way to refer to the most impoverished countries and regions of the world , serving as a blanket term for characterizing the political and economic life of latin america , africa and asia . 
  it has also began to operate as a shorthand for extreme destitution in otherwise affluent countries ; the u.s. has often been described as containing bits of the third world because of its failures in health care or exceptional wealth inequality . 
  the cold war ended and the meaning of \u201e third world '' has shifted in the meantime . 
   over the last few decades since the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , the term third world has been used interchangeably with the least developed countries , global south and developing countries to describe poorer countries that have struggled to attain steady economic development , a term that often includes `` second world '' countries like laos . 
  i 'd say 90 % applies to romania as well . 
  fascist !, 
  thanks , 
  could you translate the entire legend ? 
  some of us do n't speak german . 
  we do n't call it `` sweet moldovan speech '' for nothing ... 
   is turkish even an official language within any country in the eu ? 
  cyprus , and is set to become official once the re-unification process is completed . 
  what is the difference beside the difference ? 
  there is no difference between the two if we ignore the difference . 
  obviously .

  fun fact : the old district of bucharest is named after the [ inhabitants of leipzig ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipscani ) .

  all the balkanians are ... 
   it should be somewhere like north west hungary ; i think they gave up on enough territory ... 
  [ bt , fuck yeah ] ( https://etimpu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/tigari-bt.jpg ) !, 
  it 's mostly intelligible , especially if one is familiar with archaisms and regionalisms , although the spelling is based on hungarian spelling . 
  i once helped a friend talk to a music band that sings in be\u00e1s , and i told the musicians that maybe they could talk to the organizer directly , in be\u00e1s and he could talk in romanian , but they preferred it if i intermediated in hungarian , saying it was too different , so who knows . 
  there is some controversy whether it 's a different language or not . 
  the hungarian state considers it a different language ( with its own standardized form and spelling ) , while the romanians of hungary object to this and call it a romanian dialect . 
  apparently [ it depends a lot even within the be\u00e1s community ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/be%c3%a1sok#a_be.c3.a1sok_viszonyul.c3.a1sa_nyelv.c3.bckh.c3.b6z ) . 
   i count be\u00e1s as a romani language i think the term used is [ para-romani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/para-romani ) , to avoid mixup with the indo-iranian language that they originally spoke ( and some still speak ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guiana_shield  the ** guiana shield ** is one of the three cratons of the south american plate . 
  it is a 1.7 billion-year-old precambrian geological formation in northeast south america that forms a portion of the northern coast . 
  the higher elevations on the shield are called the guiana highlands , which is where the table-like mountains called tepuis are found . 
  the guiana highlands are also the source of some of the world 's most spectacular waterfalls such as angel falls , kaieteur falls and kuquenan falls . 
   i know two are widely spoken by hungarian romas and these two are not mutually intelligible i wonder if you 're thinking about two dissimilar dialects of romany , or romany and be\u00e1s , because be\u00e1s is not related to romany , but to romanian ( it 's an archaic form of transylvanian romanian ) . 
  we should make may 9 ^ th a holiday too . 
  4-day weekends ftw !, 
   with almost no native romanian population there was some romanian population [ in the north and along the danube ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:dobrogea-bugeac_harta_etnica_ ( 1861 \\ ) . jpg # / media/file : balkans-ethnic _ ( 1861 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
   but we did population exchanges with the ottomans and gave them a lot of turks in exchange for aromanians . 
  i think you 're mixing up the story with the population exchange [ we did with the bulgarians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_craiova ) . 
   there 's also no separatism at all as turks , tatars , lipovans , greeks , aromanians and armenians all love romania and consider themselves romanian . 
  to expand on your comment turks and tatars like romania because there was no anti-turkish sentiment in romania on the levels of that in bulgaria and other balkan states . 
  also , romania treated them well as a sort of protection against bulgarian irredentism in dobruja . 
  also , about a decade ago the spokesperson of the romanian army was a dobrujan turk , and there are many succesful romanians of the muslim minority , like the coach of the romanian male handball team .
