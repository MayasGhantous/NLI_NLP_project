  it doe n't get any more local than the '' [ bihor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bihor_county ) anthem '' . 
  it 's sung in the [ local subdialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana_subdialect_of_romanian ) . 
  * [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb-ioybq6u ), 
   his dad 's name was eminovici which is also foreign to be fair family names could have been fixed under foreign rule , while his parents could have very well been romanians . 
  i know non-romanians ( lipovans ) whose name ends in * - escu * , and bussloads of romanians with * - ovici * at the end ( popovici is a common name where i live ) . 
  also there are shitloads of romanians in transylvania with names of hungarian origin . 
  silaghi , sab\u0103u , \u015eipo\u015f , socaciu , covaci , chereche\u015f , and [ many more ] ( http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_nume_rom%c3%a2ne%c8%99ti_de_origine_maghiar%c4%83 ) ... 
  neither does `` bulgarian '' ... 
  because it comes with the benefit of being eu passport ? 
  there is no distinction in romanian . 
  when we talk about `` moldova '' we have to specify which one . 
  `` our moldova '' versus `` republic of moldova '' or `` moldova from across the prut '' . 
  how are those examples even remotely `` like mongolia '' ? 
  yeah , but * because architecture * ? 
   romania is not really a european country ( especially not the szeklers ) ; at least architecturally , it 's closer to kazakhstan or mongolia . 
  cape verde is more european than romania . 
  i 'm intrigued . 
  could you elaborate with examples ? 
  also , having a mod that is active while most of europe sleeps is helpful , as activity exists even during the ( euro - ) night . 
   to be fair it could be autommoderaror that removed it . 
  it was . 
  i re-aprovved it . 
  was in istambul last summer . 
  that city is is all over the place when it comes to variety . 
  [ the turkish viewpoint ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/15/armenian-massacres-of-1915-the-turkish-viewpoint/ ), 
  relevant : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guttural_r, 
  yeah , i can handle it , 
   sometimes it is a bit disappointing like in miskolc , where the fidesz mayor speak in romanian with his closest political allies who are also born in romania ( not about literature of course , but about political or business issues , using romanian as a crypting ) . 
  til . 
  got a source on this ? 
  for the lulz !, 
  next time if you have a request fior the mods , please use [ modmail ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2feurope ) . 
  thank you , 
   this will attract the most ardent pro-eu and anti-eu fanatics like the european parliament 's facebook feed . 
  full of ukippers and such . 
   the map is a bit misleading , there were more cities named after prominent commies . 
  the map is not one of settlements named after all communist leaders . 
  it 's a map named after national leaders . 
  de facto leaders , `` commie dictators '' so to speak . 
   context : from 1953 to 1956 katowice was named stalinogr\u00f3d . 
  ** more context ** : [ settlements name after commie national leaders ] ( https://arnoldplaton.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/final_11.png ) ( stalin is orange ), 
   attempts to present mordor 's perspective of the war , i.e. , that feudal-fundamentalists turned back the clock of history by destroying a progressive industrial state . 
  sounds interesting . 
  how 's the writing ? 
  * [ the population of europe ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2177294.the_population_of_europe ) by massimo livi bacci ( my current throne reading ) * [ envisioning information ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17745.envisioning_information ) by edward r. tufte also , recently received as a gift , and ca n't wait to start reading it : * [ hungarians on romanians : birth of an ethnic image ] ( http://www.polirom.ro/catalog/carte/ungurii-despre-romani-nasterea-unei-imagini-etnic-5440/ ) by sorin mitu & melinda mitu * ( in romanian ) *, 
  yes . 
  persecuted in russia , fled here ( the general area of the danube delta ) . 
  what 's going on in north-west czechia ? 
  and most are old believers , so not your typical post-soviet russian . 
  also , turkey left eastern thrace , and croatia has no ( smoking ) islands . 
  it 's common in szekelyland too . 
   the one who burns his mouth drinking milk when it 's too hot , eats even yogurt carefully we have the same , except with hot soup . 
   every sheep is hung by his own leg . 
  our version is \u201e every bird perishes in its own laguage '' ( * fiecare pas\u0103re pe limba ei piere * ), 
  must be a balkan thing ... 
   100 % accurate i find the inaccuracy of how pig-slaughtering is portrayed the most offensive ... 
  i see . 
  my bad . 
  in romanian , \u201e \u00ee '' ( and \u201e \u00e2 '' ) is used to write the same sound as \u201e \u0131 '' in turkish . 
  i just used a hybrid spelling because : * i do not have \u201e \u0131 '' on my keybord * i 'm too lazy to bother finding it on wiki * the suffix \u201e - l\u0131k '' was imported into romanian ( as \u201e - l\u00eec '' or \u201e - l\u00e2c '' ) so it 's not entirely foreign . 
  no offense intended . 
  `` anya '' in hungarian, 
   bearson the - ev is a patronimic, 
  thank you , 
  nope http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-slavic/medv%c4%9bd%d1%8c  from earlier * medu-\u0113dis , equivalent to * med\u044a ( `` honey '' ) + * ( j ) \u011bsti ( `` to eat '' ) , hence literally the epithet `` honey-eater '' . 
  [ ... ]  there is also a folk etymology from * med\u044a and * v\u011bd\u011bti ( `` to know , to manage '' ) , hence `` one who knows honey '' or `` honey master '' . 
   from a scientific pov i would n't say `` scientific pov '' , but rather `` orthographic pov '' . 
  it 's not exactly hard science , but an orthographic convention that other languages do n't have . 
  but i understand that it 's not entirely correct from an orthographic pov , and accept that many people , especially native german speakers , have an issue with my decision . 
  thank you !, 
  because most of ireland is anglophone . 
  only the western fringes of ireland are colored for irish . 
  ditching capitalization with german was a design decision to make the words more coherent . 
  having some with , and some without capitalization looked dissorderly imo . 
  `` lubeni\u0163\u0103 '' or `` lebeni\u0163\u0103 '' is pretty widespread in bihor, 
   great job , thanks for the effort - much appreciated !, 
  thank you   it really looks painful when nouns in german are not capitalized . 
  to me , it looks more painful when some nouns are capitalized , and some are n't . 
  so i dropped capitalization entirely . 
  sorry germans . 
   and when you 're at it , it would be simply amazing if you could also include the grammatical gender of this words ( be it a pronoun for romance and germanic languages or simply a letter ) . 
  know this is much more work but pretty pretty please ... 
  i 'm not really investing much time in these maps any more , and they are time-consuming already without gender . 
   and , indeed , as my slav brethren say , i learned that `` ved '' part comes from `` to know '' . 
  it 's a mistaken etymology that is popular in some countries . 
  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-slavic/medv%c4%9bd%d1%8c  from earlier * medu-\u0113dis , equivalent to * med\u044a ( `` honey '' ) + * ( j ) \u011bsti ( `` to eat '' ) , hence literally the epithet `` honey-eater '' . 
  [ ... ]  there is also a folk etymology from * med\u044a and * v\u011bd\u011bti ( `` to know , to manage '' ) , hence `` one who knows honey '' or `` honey master '' . 
  disclaimer : some mistakes are mistakes that i am aware of ( and have mostly been corrected over at / r/etymologymaps ) and some are design decisions . 
  these are the first batch of maps , and with some of them i never got around to correcting eastern latvia . 
  someone pointed out the mistake , and later maps are corrected . 
  the base color usually means `` standard word '' while dots mean `` colloquial usage '' . 
  so , because moldova uses standard romanian , i used the standard romanian as dominant , and the ` dialect ' as dotted , even if everybody uses the dialectal form . 
  similarly , in turkey everyone uses salatl\u00eek , even if the `` standard word '' is h\u00eeyar . 
  look , this conversation has dragged on way more than it should have . 
  i ( we ) told you how english uses the words \u201e moldova '' and \u201e moldavia '' , you can either accept it , or not . 
  english is english , and romanian is romanian . 
  think about it this way . 
  * \u0218asesprezece * might be more \u201e logical '' , but it will still be wrong to a native romanian speaker . 
  it 's not the medieval kingdom , but it 's still a historic state ( and a pretty short-lived one ) , and that still does n't mean that moldova is interchangeable with moldavia . 
  i never said moldavia is exclusive to the medieval state .
