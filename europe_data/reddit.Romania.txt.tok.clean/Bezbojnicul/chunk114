  it 's actually more the opposite , that moldova is exclusive to the current state . 
  that 's how modern english function , and using moldavia for the republic of moldova just sounds off . 
   form the majority that 's a plurality , not a majority . 
  actually , what i said was that there is no distinction in romanian , but there very well is in english . 
  that being said , you 're both being silly . 
  he 's bringing up soviet connotation that do n't really exist in english , and you 're insisting that \u201e moldova '' and \u201e moldavia '' are interchangeable in english ( which is false ) . 
  the moldavia/moldova distinction that exists in english does not exist in romanian . 
  to add some prime ministers : * [ ion gheorghe maurer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_gheorghe_maurer ) - had a german-alsatian father * [ petre roman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petre_roman ) is of jewish origin on his father 's side , and apparently spanish-basque on his mother 's * [ c\u0103lin popescu-t\u0103riceanu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c4%83lin_popescu-t%c4%83riceanu ) is of greek origin * [ victor ponta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_ponta ) has both italian and albanian/aromanian origins,

  is there some european law that specifically prohibits what i mentioned ? 
  ( i 'm not personally aware of any ), 
  how so ? 
  i know that romania 's constitution says in [ article 30 , subsection 7 ] ( http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=2 ) :  * any defamation of the country and the nation , any instigation to a war of aggression , to national , racial , class or religious hatred , any incitement to discrimination , ** territorial separatism ** , or public violence , as well as any obscene conduct contrary to morality ** shall be prohibited by law . 
  ** but i have no idea if there is any law to actually prohibit it . 
  i can tell you that i dont remember hearing of anybody being convicted of `` defamation of the country and the nation '' ( and there is no shortage of romanians who talk shit about romania ) or any of the other things in this article , so it may very well be a toothless clause . 
  is it weird that my first thoight was not `` damn that 's a bit too specific '' , but `` damn , why are n't we this prepared ? 
  can confirm . 
  why not both ? 
  my grandpa still kept the `` well with electric pump '' system even after he had running water installed . 
  one year i did have one of those teachers that thought us about other religions , and quite objectively as well . 
  but that is the exception , not the rule . 
  and our word for `` homeless '' is `` boschetar '' , meaning `` bush dweller '' .

  you might be thinking of [ vowel harmony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#hungarian ) , which seems to be absent in standard estonian ( but exists in hungarian , for example ) . 
   you always seemed like a romance poser with all those weird-ass unnatural characters ( \u015f\u0103\u0219\u0163\u021b ) still an improvement from [ 2 centuries ago ] ( https://tiparituriromanesti.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/albina-romaneasca-februarie-1830-1.jpg?w=658 ) ,

  seems to have happened often actually : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_days_of_the_week#romance_languages, 
   vas\u00e1rnap : shopping day market day would be more correct . 
  i do n't know , but my hunch is that it 's probably related to the way sound changes happened and the fact that one word is longer than the other so maybe the stress falls on different syllables and that 's why we have the difference . 
  the folks over at / r/linguistics could maybe give you a better answer , since mine is speculation . 
  thank you . 
  these are all interesting , and i really wish the first point was more central to the whole brexit debate . 
  interesting . 
  seems to be [ the european atlas of soil biodiversity ] ( http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/atlas-soil-biodiversity ),

  interesting that catalan puts the `` di '' in front , not at the end . 
  well , it 's simmilar in romance languages as well , they are derived from the latin '' [ septimana ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/septimana#latin ) '' which comes from '' [ septem ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/septem#latin ) '' , meaning * seven * , but in hungarian the words are identical . 
  `` a week '' is literally `` a seven '' .

  it feels like such a fake attempt to generate a us-style federal identity agreed . 
  that and and the ever-present reference to a possible \u201e united states of europe '' . 
   actually i do n't think there is any possibility of human to human transmission , actually , the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zika_virus#transmission ) lists human-to-human transmission as a possibility :  ** in 2009 , brian foy , a biologist from the arthropod-borne and infectious diseases laboratory at colorado state university , sexually transmitted the zika virus to his wife . 
  ** he visited senegal to study mosquitoes and was bitten on a number of occasions . 
  a few days after returning to the united states , he fell ill with zika , but not before having had unprotected intercourse with his wife . 
  she subsequently showed symptoms of zika infection with extreme sensitivity to light . 
  foy is the first person known to have passed on an insect-borne virus to another human by sexual contact .

  given that there are over 1 milion romanians in italy , that is very much a possibility . 
  now i 'm curious what the guy looks like , 
   what would be the case in your country ? 
  some people would be upset , some would call it tasteless , some would call for it to be banned , but actually banning it would cause more shit than the satire itself . 
  there is ( or was until recently , i 'm not sure ) some law against the defamation of the flag , the nation and so on , but it 's unenforced ( i have never ever heard anyone being charged with something like that ) . 
  i love that song !,

  i really like `` the goat '' on new years ( if i 'm in a rural setting ) . 
  in the apuseni you often have one of the people play [ this awesome instrument ] ( http://www.ebihoreanul.ro/user_files/12%20higheghe%20 ( coloana \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  [ quick context ] ( http://celergo.com/new-years-traditions-and-customs-in-romania/ ) , for non-romanians :  the most colorful new year 's eve traditions are the mask-dances , magical ceremonials of death and rebirth , with a variety of representations from the animal world like goats , horses or bears , and fictional characters like the devil . 
   one of the most spectacular mask-dances is the `` dance of the bear '' , an iconic animal for the forests of romania . 
  symbolizing the death and rebirth of the new year , the dance of the bearbrings to the scene intricate costumes . 
  the dance is usually accompanied by the music of drums that dictate the rhythm of the performance . 
   another representative mask-dance is the `` goat '' that tells the story of powerful magical practices that have the power of resurrecting the animal after it was charmed , another symbol of the death and rebirth of nature . 
  usually , the goat mask is carved from wood , covered in fur , with a jaw that moves up and down and has horns from a real goat . 
  the body of the goat is made out of a colorful carpet . 
   attractive and spectacular , the mask-dances are the highlights of new year 's eve traditions in the villages of romania where they are still performed and conserved .

  sad to see you get downvoted . 
   by the way , here 's the map of regions with hungarian speakers outside the current borders of hungary missing the csango 's of moldova  * also , fun fact : * there is no hungarian dialect group that is entirely within hungary , and 3 groups are entirely outside it . 
  it also cropped out the [ csango village of oituz ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/oituz_ ( constan % c8 % 9ba_megye \\ ) ) , near the sea side , 
  well , even places that have less than 10 % hungarians , still belong to a dialect-area . 
  a dialectal map needs to include all the areas of the language , not represent majorities . 
  baltics , west slavs , a bit of east slavs and hungarian . 
  that 's an odd mix ...
