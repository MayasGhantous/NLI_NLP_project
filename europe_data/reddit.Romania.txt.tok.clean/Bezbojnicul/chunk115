  it is , but the uk seems to be the only country that 's gone beyond mere dissent to the level where they are debating whether to take part in the game at all . 
  you see , all countries have strong feelings about various issues ( like the easterners ' opinion on the foreign affairs high-commissioner ) , but the uk seems the only one that uses the `` if i do n't get what i want i 'm leaving '' card . 
   holland is just a part of the netherlands , so it is incorrect to call it such . 
  [ pars pro toto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pars_pro_toto#geography ) is used all the time . 
  it does n't make it incorrect . 
   the gaelic country actually , it 's literally the welsh country . 
  it 's an adaptation of the french `` pays des galles '' . 
  in french , initial w became g ( `` william '' -  `` guillaume '' , `` war '' -  `` guerre '' ) . 
  and `` wales '' comes from proto-germanic '' * [ walhaz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhaz ) '' , meaning `` foreigner '' , etymologically related to `` vlach '' . 
  it 's not etymologically connected to gaels and gauls , funnily enough . 
  sometimes it 's obvious , but sometimes it 's not . 
  marko b\u00e9la is often confused because marko sounds like the first name marco/marcu and b\u00e9la sounds like the italian adjective/last name bello ( and pronounced like that since \u201e \u00e9 '' and \u201e a '' sounds do n't exist in romanian ) . 
  marko b\u00e9la appears in hungarian name order even in romanian media . 
  others appear in western , and others in both ( usually , the more they appear in the media , the more one of the two orders becomes permanent ) . 
   i dont think it is that big of a hassle to reverse the order for ethnic hungarians that implies knowing which is which . 
  we do n't . 
  that 's why we do it unintentionally sometimes . 
  i have no idea how they measure , but a country that is 45 % white and 45 % brown like brazil is by any measure more diverse than romania which is 80 % -90 % ethnic romanian and orthodox . 
  ( * offtopic * you wrote the comment twice . ), 
   also , it 's tesz\u00e1ri zolt\u00e1n hungarian diacritics do n't exist in romanian ( and romanians are more relaxed about diacritics than hungarians anyway ) . 
  also , western name order ... 
  cluj-napoca  ** romania [ salo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salo_\\ ( food \\ ) ) **  cluj-napoca and throughout romania believes nokia and the future . 
  the town was built new roads and handsome to the airport . 
  they have it managed to attract a nokia set up a factory just to get there . 
  all looked good : people built their houses , and the city 's football team reached the champions league . 
  the eu promised money . 
  nokia designed the industrial park . 
  nokia stayed in cluj-napoca four years . 
  then , nokia mobile phones are no longer been sold . 
  of course it 's about nokia ... 
  romania more diverse than brazil ? 
  more diverse than the uk ? 
  the fuck has the mapmaker been smoking ? 
  interesting . 
  my variant is dialectal , and it 's probably from the romanian '' [ buruian\u0103 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/buruian%c4%83#romanian ) '' , or from slavic ( like the romanian one ) , and survived due to the existence of the romanian word , which probably reinforced it . 
   even the people that are against immigration should be aware that the people who are already accepted here will not magically disappear actually , die-hard anti-immigration people want deportation . 
  the more extensive the better . 
   gaz can mean weed or villainous does n't it mean `` trash '' as well ? 
  because it means that in dialectal romanian ( `` goz '' ) . 
  anyway , i never heard it used as a standalone word , only in the compound `` gazember '' . 
  the word for weed used by my grandparents was `` burij\u00e1ny '' . 
  should n't wales be white/green stripes ? 
  [ relevant map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/germany_name_european_languages.svg/1486px-germany_name_european_languages.svg.png ) . 
  good catch !, 
  i 've seen that hungary is starting to use `` georgia '' instead of `` gr\u00fazia '' like in other languages . 
  why is n't it written `` dzsorzsia '' ? 
  is n't it pronounced like that ? 
  somewhat [ relevant ] ( https://arnoldplaton.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/orszag_en1.png ) . 
   `` t\u00f3torsz\u00e1g '' ( t\u00f3tcountry - slovakia ) was n't `` tothorsz\u00e1g '' used for slavonia ( in croatia ) as well ? 
  i remember seeing something to that effect . 
   ( and used during the soviet era ) the same standard language as romanians , not a different standard based on the local dialects . 
  there was a brief period ( 1930s-1940s ) when they ( well , the soviet moldovan rass ) used the local dialect as the standard : https://cartimoldovasovietica.wordpress.com/, 
  estonia , letonia , lituania, 
   that area it still is a shithole and no future prospects for the local people . 
  that 's because the area was classified as a `` mono-industrial zone '' so you could n't develop anything besides mining . 
  the riversistem comming from there is : ro\u0219ia -  abrud -  arie\u0219 ( aranyos ) -  mure\u0219 ( maros ) -  tisa ( in hu ), 
  sons of perkele sounds awesome !, 
  ( or at least that 's what a certain subreddit conditioned me to think ... ), 
  the eu does n't offer much when it comes to defense . 
  it 's too dysfunctional , and thus not really credible as a defense alliance . 
  there is no pan-eu army , hardly any pan-eu foreign policy , and in a situation of crisis , no system of quick response . 
  by the time the eu convenes in summit to agree to the writing of a strongly worded letter , the crisis already played itself out . 
  you 're mixing internal politics and foreign policy . 
  yes , eastern europe wants to leave a lot of bad post-ww2 shit behind ( dysfunctional economy , corruption , etc. ), 
  but those are all domestic affairs . 
  you can not leave behind fear of an aggressive neighbor , because you can not move your country 1000km to the west . 
  you can not believe that an aggressive neighbor wants peace , when it acts exactly in a way which confirms your fears ( i do n't think you realize how much geopolitical anxiety the anexation of crimea and the invasion of eastern ukraine unleashed ) . 
  it 's easy to say `` leave it all behind '' when your not affected and your country is many miles away . 
  there is an old commie-era joke : \u201e you know why the russians are called `` our brothers from the east '' and not `` our friends '' ? '' - \u201e because you can choose your friends '' . 
   yes they took terrible advantage after the fact , but that is n't the topic . 
  if you wan na discuss eastern europe 's current foreign policy , it very much is the topic . 
  poland 's foreign policy ( as well as many other eastern european nations ' foreign policy ) today is very much a reaction to russian domination in the 1945-1989 period . 
  you really have to understand , ww2 basically ended in 1989 for many people . 
   and they knew that if the bear bit back , that the rest of europe would have to defend them . 
  poland 's defence is resting on nato , not the eu . 
  your last paragraph is meaningless . 
  there is no joint foreign policy of the eu and no eu stance towards russia that poland is obliged to adhere to . 
  you are mixing `` rule of law '' and eu membership ( the subjects of the thread ) with foreign policy , which is meaningless here . 
  also , you clearly show you do n't understand how eastern europe feels about wwii and what their security priorities are . 
  saying that `` russia saved europe '' is just ... wrong on so many levels . 
  by your logic , an institution that makes a mistake should continue making the same mistake , for the sake of not appearing arbitrary . 
  i would prefer the comission to act in all cases from now on , not give poland a free pass because it failed to act in hungary . 
  my position is that the comission should launch a review whenever necessary , regardless of past mistakes . 
  failing to act 10 times is worse that failing to act once and acting 9 times . 
  an a related note , i remember the controversial reforms in hungary were significantly toned down eventually from their initial ( more controversial form ) after eu outcry . 
  that may be a reason why the procedure was n't eventually launche , although it 's a speculation at this point . 
  it has been explained elsewhere that hungary * is the reason * this framework exists . 
  hungary was n't `` given a pass '' , because there was no framework in 2011/2012 , when the whole `` rule of law in hungary '' scandal was in full swing . 
  i am all for an honest debate , but the whole `` hungary was given a pass '' is downright false ( and as far as i understand , laws , including this framework , are , or should be , non-retroactive ) . 
   just because the eu gets new powers , this does not mean that we should think that electorates always want it to have those powers . 
  and just because a power did n't exist at the time does not delegitimize it . 
  poland signed up to the eu , and as such is subject to all the legal frameworks at the eu 's disposal . 
  if a new framework appears , it does so with the explicit or implicit approval of poland ( poland signed up to an eu with rules and rules for making new rules ) . 
  if poland thinks that a particular eu power is illegitimate , it has the right to withdraw from the union . 
   i think we can both agree that there are limits to the legitimacy of votes , but there are multiple ways to police them . 
  i think policing them with outside forces has the potential ( when we consider poland 's particular history ) to have negative consequences . 
  yes , it does have that potential . 
  and poland is in a situation when what it signed up for clashes with what it wants . 
  the eu not acting also has the potential to have negative consequences ( not only in poland ) . 
   the eu that poland joined did not have the existing rule of law framework are you seriously arguing that the polish electorate thought the eu would never change ?
