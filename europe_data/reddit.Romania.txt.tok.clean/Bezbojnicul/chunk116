   perhaps because i am british and we do n't have a constitutional court and have paliamentary sovereignty in which the powers of a particular parliament are constitutionally unlimited i instinctively think that the sentiment of the voter is of more importance than the constitutional court . 
  i 'm sure that is one of the reasons . 
  another is your dislike of the eu . 
   from what i can gather the polish constitutional court does not i was n't talking about the polish constitutional court . 
  i was talking about constitutional courts as a matter of principle . 
  since you argue that the most recent vote takes precedent over constitutional courts , do you also feel that the most recent vote should trump earlier votes ? 
  because a constitutional referendum is one such earlier vote , and your argument 's logical outcome is that constitutions are less legitimate than `` last week 's elections '' ( so basically , useless ) . 
   they agreed to a set of rules for joining the eu . 
  it 's baffling how few people seem to get this . 
   it also infantilises the polish electorate . 
  the same polish electorate voted for politicians that got them into a union that has the power to intervene in such a way ? 
  do you also believe that constitutional courts `` infantilise the electorate '' , since that also sometimes overrides the immediate voter sentiment ? 
  i 'm so sorry to hear that . 
  if you feel the need to talk to people who understand what you 're going through i recommend / r/cancer . 
  they really helped me last year when i needed it most . 
  internet hugs !, 
  fuck cancer . 
   if i see fellow countrymen be slightly better than me i do all i can to sabotage them . 
  ah , yes , the * `` may my neighbour 's goat die as well '' * - mentality ... 
  they celebrate on 25th, 
  some orthodox churches ( ro , bg , gr ) use the revised julian calendar , which is essentially the same as the gregorian ( western ) calendar . 
  so christmas falls on 25 december . 
  others ( ru , ukr , srb ) otoh use the julian calendar , and celebrate it on 7 january . 
  gregorian, 
  * some orthodox guys ( romanians , bulgarians and greeks do it on dec 25 ), 
  a lot of times it 's a slavic word . 
   b\u00f3j which entered , from serbo-croatian , [ into hungarian ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/baj#hungarian ) as * baj * meaning \u201e trouble , problem '' , and from there , dialectal romanian , as * bai * with the [ same meaning ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/bai ) . 
  \u201e r\u0103zboi '' also means loom in romanian too . 
  plotwist : the driver is actually a pterodactyl !, 
  love it !, 
   na of course just means `` not applicable '' . 
  very very nice map !, 
  my only critique would be that ** na ** is too blue . 
  i think desaturating the color more ( making it more grey ) would help bring the other colors more into focus . 
  that one has errors too . 
  the area that is marked as ( volga ) tatar is actually bashkir . 
  tatar is imediately to the west .

  thanks , fixed it . 
  i had typed an * 0 * at the end by mistake . 
  i remember reading about it recently , but ca n't for the life of me find it where . 
  i know there is a similar case with the word \u201e [ morav ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/morav/503308 ) '' which is basically an attempt to turn the slavic \u201e [ n\u0103rav ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/n%c4%83rav ) '' into a latin word originating from \u201e mos , mores '' doing a [ quick search ] ( https://tiparituriromanesti.wordpress.com/?s=rezbel ) for * rezbel * in the \u201e tip\u0103rituri rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti '' blog gives me only 2 results , one from 1855 , and one from 1856 , so around the time this shift would have been tried . 
  ( \u201e r\u0103zbel '' gives zero ) . 
  tbf , albanian is ridiculously latinized . 
  heads up : the distribution of russian is mistaken . 
  it should be [ more to the south ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/use_of_russian_language_at_home_in_latvia_%282011%29.svg/1024px-use_of_russian_language_at_home_in_latvia_%282011%29.svg.png ) also , what hapenned to the turkophone area in ne bulgaria ? 
   the archaic form of romanian `` r\u0103zboi '' is `` r\u0103zbel '' , which i always thought comes from a latin `` res ? 
  it may be a calque on the slavic word . 
  \u201e rezbel '' is from the time we tried really hard to find latin etymologies for slavic words , and we invented \u201e rezbel '' to make it closer to \u201e res bellum '' . 
  it was \u201e r\u0103zboi '' even way back , afaik . 
  i ca n't see the image . 
  try uploading it to imgur, 
  not tito ? 
  such is life . 
  `` ca\u015fcaval '' is a specific kind of cheese ( yellow one ) . 
  the general word is `` br\u00e2nz\u0103 '' . 
   romanian , even now , is very similar to latin . 
  even more so than most other romance languages . 
  this is a myth . 
  it is more conservative on some fronts ( it preserved some aspects that were lost in other romance languages ) , but it 's very innovative on others . 
   you guys are really close [ 2 ] ( also with croatia ) in ppp .

  centrist as in neither left nor right , not `` centralist '' . 
  should n't this :  united forces with mas to push for catalan independence . 
  they could also be decisive . 
  partido nacionalista vasco ( basque nationalist party ) : conservative basque nationalists . 
  unlike their catalan counterparts , be formated as :  united forces with mas to push for catalan independence . 
  they could also be decisive . 
   ** partido nacionalista vasco ** ( basque nationalist party ) : conservative basque nationalists . 
  unlike their catalan counterparts , also , i 've seen guy verhofstadt endorsing ciudadanos a lot lately , so i think the * euro group * section could be written as `` probably alde '' or something similar, 
  maybe he can donate it to an organisation fighting for gay rights ( not necessarily in russia if that gets them in legal trouble , but maybe in serbia :p ), 
  it 's common in many parts of the world : * [ chinese and pakistani border guards ] ( https://i.imgur.com/w1srtqo.jpg ) * [ american and saudi heads of state ] ( http://www.resourcesforlife.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/20150119tu-diplomacy-us-president-george-w-bush-holds-hand-with-king-saudi-arabia-6446422.jpg ) relevant wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holding_hands, 
  no stress . 
  but yeah , the lack of palatals is kinda funny . 
  car is kept in a * garaz * , 
  [ greek does n't lack [ b ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_greek_phonology ), 
  a big reason is because the inventory of sounds in the two languages is roughly the same . 
  yeah , the turkish in your video sounds more fully articulated , like the words are more fully pronounced , but the general feel of the language is the same . 
  i would n't call this `` rough '' either , tbh . 
   edirne , bursa and istanbul are all former capitals of the ottoman empire of course yeah , that 's why we chose those 3 cities . 
  do you have a video of rural turkish accent for comparison ? 
  i did notice that the turkic languages of central asia are a bit rougher . 
  ( i only visited edirne , bursa and istanbul , plus the turkish i heard from tv ) . 
  i think it was because there were a high number of polish tourist around that time ( this was in 2000 ) , so that was the slavic language tunisians were most exposed to . 
  it sounds really soft . 
  it has a nice flow to it , and is not abrasive , like some of the slavic languages for example . 
  to a slavic speaker , it 's probably the romance parts that are more evident , but some non-slavs it 's vice-versa . 
  people just notice some things that are sort of slavic , and default to russian . 
  in tunisia vendors would assume we were polish . 
   one of the bulgarian most interesting but sometimes pejorative saying is ** `` do n't quit like the wallachians at the shores of the danube '' ** ( `` \u041d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439 \u0414\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430 '' ) . 
  it means to quit doing something when the end of the task is in sight , or the advice to not fall in despair because something is difficult when the end is obviously near . 
  it also usually means that the tough part is over and it would be a shame to not finish what you started . 
  interestingly , we have the expression `` to drown like gypsy at the shore '' meaning * to fail at the last moment , right before finishing the job * . 
  eerily close . 
  also , obligatory : [ i am triggered ! ], 
   we have these \u0160arplaninac similar to the [ carpathian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpathian_shepherd_dog ) . 
  some other breeds are the [ mioritic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_mioritic_shepherd_dog ) and [ bukovinian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucovina_shepherd_dog ), 
   to be honest i 'm not sure how they 'll enforce the number of dogs restriction either ...
