  i saw mentioned on facebook that the restrictions existed already since 2006 , this law was just re-confirming it . 
  and of course it was not enforced . 
  if you wan na see the storming , click on the second video [ from this link ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/social/protest+tensionat+al+oierilor+in+fata+parlamentului+sunt+nemultu ) . 
  it 's basically because i volunteered to help them set up their flair system . 
  ( i am from romania , of mixed heritage ), 
  i noticed martinique also elected regionalists . 
  what are the implications there ? 
   many people had trouble finding someone they wanted to vote for ( lots of `` white votes '' ) . 
  to be fair , looking at the electoral material i got in the mail here in nice , the fn seemed to have the most professional and detailed leaflets . 
  also i looked at the posters , and the choices were pretty meh . 
  lots of small parties that were either \u201e patriotism !, 
  ! '' ( which is not my cup of tea ) , \u201e arise ye workers ! '' ( which is so last century ) and the greens with \u201e save the planet '' ( which is just too vague ) or the two big parties that just screamed \u201e vote establishment dude ! '' and looked like they were made of plastic . 
  the fn seemed like the only ones with a bit of life in them with specific points for everything ( and they were the first to get the leaflets in the mail , which is a big symbolic plus ) . 
  * disclaimer : this is the on-the-fly opinion of an eastern european living in nice , so please take no offence . 
  i 'm new to french politics *, 
  the wikipedia article on ottoman turkish seems to suggest that persian was the language of prestige , and a lot of arabic elements entered via persian . 
   yes it is !, 
  that 's entirely your subjective point of view . 
  i 'm sorry , but there is nothing inherently bad with having a lot of borrowed words . 
  do you think words of french origin like `` asans\u00f6r '' should be removed from turkish ? 
   would you be happy if most of `` romanian '' was russian and turkish ? 
  funny you should say that . 
  most romanian words are n't directly descended from latin ( although the most important ones are ) . 
  there are huge slavic , and to a lesser extent turkic , hungarian , greek , and so on influences . 
  we borrowed like crazy from french and italian in the 19 ^ th century . 
  none of the changes have made romanian any less romanian . 
  hungarian has less than a quarter of the original uralic vocabulary ( hungarian is an uralic language ) . 
  again , many borrowings from slavic an turkic languages , as well as german . 
  30 % of words are of unknown etymology . 
  it 's still 100 % hungarian . 
  moldova and wallachia used slavonic as a chancellery language in the middle ages , so unlike the ottomans , the official language wasnt a heavilly modified version of the local language but a different one altogether . 
  also , there are many cases when the standard dialect differes significantly from the local spoken variety . 
  arabic is a classic exmaple ( compare the modern standard arabic to the variety spoken by the arabs in the maghreb ) . 
  also , i am highly skeptical of the claim that arab and persian elements were `` forced '' upon the language , as much as they had higher [ prestige ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prestige_ ( sociolinguistics \\ ) ) . 
   i 'm confused where you 're getting the 50 % figure from or if its just an example . 
  i used 50 % because you made it seem as if having more non-turkish elements ( i.e. 
  a majority ) than turkish is somehow inherently bad . 
  fun fact : * `` dili '' * means * crazy * where i 'm from , 
  so if turkish contains less than 50 % turkish words , than it is \u201e destroyed '' ? 
  i know what ottoman turkish was . 
  i was asking about how you think the ottoman empire \u201e destroyed your language '' . 
   you 're talking about a caliphate who * destroyed our language . 
  * i 'm curious ... what do you mean by the above ? 
  it still is many languages . 
   since they are kosovar citizens . 
  ( i meant `` kosovar roma '' , not `` albanian roma '' . ), 
  and they have to do with kosovo , obviously , since they are kosovar citizens . 
  if you ask about origin , the roma come from what is now north-west india . 
  ~ ~ albanian ~ ~ kosovo roma have nothing to do with romania or egypt . 
  thank you . 
  i suspected that that is what she meant ( \u201e communotarianist associations '' ) , but the word \u201e enfermement '' was confusing me . 
   the most notable thing would be removing the financing of associations . 
  marion le pen said she 'll stop funding lgbt organisations . 
  she also said she/they will stop financing \u201e any association that supports illegal immigration '' . 
  what is \u201e association d'enfermement communautaire '' btw ? 
  she said she 'll stop financing those too . 
  i wish they did n't have to leave brussels , but i have to admit , i love the strasbourg headquarters , both inside , and outside . 
  so i see [ haplogroup n ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/haplogrupo_n_%28adn-y%29.png ) is related to [ haplogroup o ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/haplogrupo_o_%28adn-y%29_edit.png ) both descended from haplogroup no . 
   [ haplogroup n-m231 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_n-m231 ) is a descendant haplogroup of haplogroup no . 
  it is considered relatively young , having populated the north of eurasia after the last ice age . 
  males carrying the marker apparently moved northwards as the climate warmed in the holocene . 
   the absence of haplogroup n-m231 in the americas indicates that its spread across asia happened after the submergence of the bering land bridge ( chiaroni 2009 ) . 
  it is suggested that it arose in southeast asia 19.4 \u00b1 4.8 ky years ago , and then migrated in a counter-clockwise path from modern day regions of mongolia and northern china to as far as northeastern europe ( rootsi 2006 ) . 
  interesting stuff . 
  the initial map though needs some additional info on it ... like a title . 
  wtf am i lookin at ? 
  i 've noticed this to be true in a way with other denominations as well ( in my hometown there are many baptists and pentecostals and so on ) . 
  newly converted neo-protestants seem to be way more fanatic than second-generation people . 
  * strugl * - fom the english '' * struggle * '' ^ ^ i ^ ^ made ^ ^ that ^ ^ up, 
   and what is it doing wrong ? 
  communicating with the general public . 
   the sz\u00e9kely anthem is rather nice , too . 
  [ much better version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1t44q1xmzg ) imo . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/romania_historic_regions-hu.svg/640px-romania_historic_regions-hu.svg.png ), 
  source : https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/11/european-economies-most-optimistic/, 
   i assume that armenia deals with russia/europe division , too . 
  afaik , they are much more pro-russia because of immediate geopolitical needs ( the situation in nagorno-karabakh ) . 
  put a \\ before the ) for your link to work . 
  interesting how visible historic bretagne is on that electoral map . 
  why are they so much more to the left ? 
  why strange ? 
  too high or too low ? 
  according to an [ ires poll ] ( http://www.stiripesurse.ro/majoritatea-romanilor-de-acord-cu-finantarea-bisericii-din-bani-publici_952586.html ) done last april , 55 % of romanians agree with the state financing the church . 
  now that was 8 months ago , and judging by the downward trend , i would n't be surprised if that number went down a few percentage points . 
   in the quran , some verses contradict others , it is accepted , there is a rule to determine which is true in that case . 
  the one verse that was written the lattest historically is the one that prevails over the verse that was written before . 
  replace `` verse '' with `` sura '' ( `` chapter '' badically ) and your statement is more correct . 
  two verses of the same sura that are contradictory can not be rectified by your method , only 2 verses from differrnt suras . 
  fuck netherlands , am i right ? 
   it 's assumed these original nomads were the huns . 
  nope . 
  huns invaded in the 4 ^ th century , hungarians ( magyars ) in the 9 ^ th . 
  also , there seems to be no connection between them , except for the fact that both were steppe nomads . 
   and hungary meaning `` land of the huns '' . 
  wrong !, 
  `` hungary '' comes from the name of a turkik confederation named the `` onogur '' . 
  the ** h ** was added later . 
  even today , in many languages the ** h ** is n't there . 
  that 's hardly weird ... 
  so what should be our answer ?
