  never innovate ? 
   you can look at buildings from different time periods in europe and see continuity modernism did n't appear out of the blue , it has plenty of continuity with preceding styles . 
   well style is usually something that is built on over time . 
  there are plenty of examples of styles rejecting what came before . 
  the people of the renaissance rejected gothic architecture , the neoclasicists rejected baroque , there is a lot of continuity , but there is also a long history of styles breaking from the past . 
   there is nothing beautiful about flat surfaces and sharp lines . 
  this is the kind of statement that is a personal opinion masquerading as objective truth . 
  there are plenty of people who find beauty in flat surfaces and sharp lines . 
  if you think the kind of buildings made today by gehry or hadid are easy to make in autocad , i have bad news for you ... 
  also , a modern building worthy of a city center is usually not cheap at all . 
  i think your critique relies on the fundamentally false assumption that decoration is a sine qua non of architectural beauty . 
  architects never stopped caring about beauty , but beauty and refinement have moved to other areas : volumetry , the relationship of heavy and light element , the textures and materials used in the building and so on . 
  but let me ask you one thing : do you think architects should be constrained by popular ideas of `` decoration = beauty '' ? 
  i feel it 's very close to the idea that only figurative art is `` real art '' while the abstract art of today is somehow `` people being edgy '' . 
  at what point can we tell the general public that their definition ( of what is beauty in art/architecture ) is a bit dated ? 
   you can tell that the people who built them really put in a lot of effort to decorate them except until the protestant reformation , after which the protestnats ( well , lutherans at least ) painted the walls white and called it a day . 
    at the very least architects should put in some effort to beautify buildings in ways that can be appreciated by the common man , instead of focusing on being avant-garde at all costs . 
  one can be avant-garde and put in effort to make the building more relatable . 
  it 's not like architects are n't trying . 
  but the problem with contemporary architecture versus historical one is that you see the failures of modernity , while nobody really notices the failures of the renaissance that much ( at least those fuckups aquired historical value , while contemporary fuckups do n't even have that ) . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  there are plenty of valid criticisms against modernity , and some of the attempts to address them might be even worse ( i 'm not a big fan of post-modern architecture ) but some of the core elements of modernism are not inherently bad ( like lack of decorations ) if they are balanced out . 
  ( also many of what we know as classic architecture was hugely avant-garde at the time . ), 
  that is a masterfully executed work . 
  both were designed by daniel liebeskind iirc . 
   i do n't want to become one of those ` wrong generation ' types but in earlier days people built things with beauty and craftsmanship foremost in mind and now structures are foremost utilitarian . 
  you do n't want to , but you totally are . 
  just because people experiment more with structure , does n't mean that beauty is a second class imperative . 
  it 's just that people were more structurally conservative back in the day because technology had n't changed much in a long time , so they were experimenting more on other fronts . 
   you will never see a railway station like this built in modern times , for instance . 
  that 's because that style is long out of fashion . 
  aesthetic styles are very much tied to their respective time periods . 
  we do n't do baroque anymore because it 's not the counter-reformation any more ( for example ) . 
   you will never see a railway station like this built in modern times , for instance . 
  there is also an argument of numbers here . 
  the number of railway stations being built is also significantly smaller than during the time period that those railway stations were built . 
  now the monumental stuff is reserved for airports . 
  that 's because modernist architecture is strongly correlated with technological improvements such as reinforced concrete . 
  that allowed a lot of formalistic experimentation that just was n't possible before , and , as with any experimentation , not all results are are positive . 
  some of the criticisms of modernist architecture are already being adressed at least since the 1980 's , with the emergence of styles such as postmodernism , critical regionalism and so on . 
  also , there are plenty of examples of flat surfaces in traditional architecture , like in [ tibet ] ( http://c7.alamy.com/comp/dgy97y/view-on-the-tibetan-architecture-of-a-small-village-tibetan-houses-dgy97y.jpg ) or [ morocco ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2d/58/d4/2d58d4e3cb3b4a87303f19e3a7156584.jpg ) . 
   i also get the impression that a lot of these modern architects are often more concerned with shock value than with beauty . 
  like `` hey , look at me , i did something weird that few people are going to understand , i 'm an artist ! '', 
  while i agree that some parts of modern architecture might be hard to digest , and modern architecture does have its ( quite well documented ) downsides , i still feel there are plenty of examples of absolutely beautiful modern building , churches included . 
  tadao ando 's `` church of light '' is a - pardon me saying - classic example in this regard . 
  it really annoys me that people tend to throw modernist baby out with the bathwater . 
  also , what is beautiful and what is not also has a subjective dimension . 
  we generally consider gothic architecture to be beautiful nowadays , but the funny thing is that the name `` gothic '' was given by the people of the renaissance to belittle the stile as calling it `` gothic '' was synonimous with calling it `` barbaric '' . 
   for one , the mixture is completely off balance , with the modernist part quite literally dominating the classic building ( even sitting on top of the damn thing ) . 
  agreed . 
  the new part seems totally disconnected from the old one . 
  like it does n't want to touch it ... 
  also , since 14 november , 4 clandestine places of worship were closed in the [ alpes-maritimes departement ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/alpes-maritimes-position.svg/440px-alpes-maritimes-position.svg.png ) ( in nice , beausoleil , drap , and tourette-levens ) * [ source ] ( http://www.nicematin.com/faits-de-societe/lutte-antiterroriste-les-mesures-mises-en-place-par-le-prefet-des-alpes-maritimes-3015 ),

   and the horse is ...  ... yup , in the sausage . 
  better than ours ' , which ended up in the * beef section * of western supermarkets , 
  it 's done because just saying `` moldova '' always begs for clarifications . 
  `` ours '' or `` the one beyond the prut '' ? 
  1940 , as per the [ treaty of craiova ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_craiova ), 
  an honest mistake . 
  istanbul was the capital for a long time , and is still the most important city . 
   they both have their capitals in the balkans turkey 's capital is in anatolia , 
  that 's crazy talk ...

  text if behind paywall :  images : [ coat of arms ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/hc-gu038_coat_o_g_20151113150019.jpg ) and [ map ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/p1-bv571_badmap_16u_20151123184522.jpg )  lorch , germany -- marco barillaro is foreign minister of a country that got on the map by cartographic error . 
  never mind that his free state of bottleneck , now a tiny collection of castles and hillside wineries , lasted only a few years almost a century ago and was never officially recognized . 
  mr. barillaro and his government colleagues aim to keep its heritage alive anyway . 
    bottleneck 's self-appointed , unpaid cabinet meets erratically , usually at a tavern or foreign-ministry headquarters , a rustic restaurant at a campsite . 
  the ministers drink local riesling and brainstorm plans to promote the region or drum up support among locals . 
    `` when people see me walking through lorch , '' says mr. barillaro , whose day job is running the campsite , `` i can tell it clicks and they are aware of my role . ''   free state of bottleneck , freistaat flaschenhals in german , came about by a stroke of fate at world war i 's close , when allied powers mapped occupation zones in germany . 
  two carelessly penciled compass arcs around the cities of koblenz and mainz left roughly 17,000 people in limbo between the american and french zones , historians say . 
    part of the hourglass-shaped blank spot became a diplomatic no-man 's - land the size of gibraltar . 
  locals thought it resembled a bottle 's neck , cut off from the rest of unoccupied germany by rough mountains on the cork end and bordered by the rhine on the other . 
    `` it 's unthinkable today and , to be honest , it should have never happened , '' says german lt. col. achim kloppert , a military historian who has visited the region more than a hundred times . 
  `` officers at the time clearly did a sloppy job . ''   the region , including the rhine villages lorch and kaub , created territorial friction . 
  france tried to snag the area , but residents wanted no part of france and pushed to rejoin germany , says bottleneck president peter josef bahles . 
    `` most people think it was a joke , '' says monika kunz , a local vintner , `` but it was deadly earnest . ''   people of the steep valley begrudgingly established a government , printed money and lived an outlaw existence : no country recognized bottleneck , and its neighbors forbade commerce with it , so the occupiers deemed its foreign trade to be smuggling . 
    locals adapted to their absurd predicament . 
  bottleneck 's `` emergency money '' depicted people drinking local wine . 
  `` if adam had only had the wine from lorch , he would not have eaten the apple , '' reads the scrip , cherished by collectors . 
  `` this grape juice would have deafened him to eve 's cunning plan . ''   the wine proved more liquid than the bank notes . 
  rhine boat crews paid for bottleneck wine and liquor with meat , coal and other goods scarce in the outlaw land , locals say . 
    `` it sounds like a fairy tale , '' says alan sked , professor of international history at the london school of economics and political science . 
  `` something as amusing , comical and magical as this , you do not usually associate with german history . ''   it is n't clear when bottleneck ended its estrangement , historians say . 
  locals say it was when the french occupied it in 1923 . 
  university of mainz historian stephanie zibell says it was probably when french forces left in 1924 . 
    bottleneck reverted to german jurisdiction , but survived in local lore . 
  residents took pride in a former border-crossing post , left from the bottleneck era , that made a cameo in the 1960 elvis presley movie `` g.i. 
  blues . ''   in 1994 , some residents decided to revive the ersatz nation and declare themselves its government . 
  they created a flag and coat of arms . 
    `` ministers are appointed according to their skills and abilities , '' mr. barillaro says , noting he qualified as foreign minister through his sound knowledge of computers and new media . 
  `` it 's great to be the tourism minister , because i get to sample all the best wine and food , '' says harald kutsche , a restaurant head chef who has led the ministry of tourism since 1994 . 
  `` you receive special attention . ''   to attract tourists , the cabinet organizes annual wine tastings at venues such as a baroque estate overlooking the rhine that also serves as a dental clinic and beauty spa . 
  but it is usually the same faces that show up and quaff free wine , locals say .
