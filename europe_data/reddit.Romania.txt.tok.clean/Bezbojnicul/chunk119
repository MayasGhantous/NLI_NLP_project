  about 15 years ago , a local bank helped issue a regional currency , the bottleneck taler , for payments in local shops and restaurants . 
  few of the silver coins circulated , as collectors and speculators snapped them up . 
  with silver 's price down , leaders see a chance to issue new talers , but the minting machine is too outdated , says president bahles . 
    then there are the passports . 
  the government has sold about 4,000 so far to locals and visitors . 
  another 2,000 are on order . 
  the mock documents cost up to $ 55 ( about $ 59 ) and hold only novelty value . 
  their real draw is an accompanying three-course meal . 
    `` i do n't let my clout hang out , '' says michael roessler , whose title is minister of environment , conservation and reactor safety , although there is no nuclear reactor nearby , `` but i happily show off my passport to curious tourists . ''   manfred rose , a semiretired tour guide from wiesbaden , about an hour 's drive away , enjoys confusing customs officials with his bottleneck passport . 
  `` it can be a real door opener , but unfortunately not all international airports deem it fit for a visa , '' says mr. rose , who has collected stamps in his bottleneck passport from over a dozen countries . 
  he also presents his german passport . 
    bottleneck faces frequent military incursions . 
  officers from a german army base up the rhine often visit the local site of a daring 1814 river crossing by prussian and russian troops chasing napoleon . 
  bottleneck leaders say young germans should appreciate the region 's history more . 
  one and two centuries ago , says mr. barillaro , it was `` a bulwark against the french . ''   the cabinet now wants to establish ceremonial ties with other micro-entities , like the free state of boyard on france 's coast . 
  last year , boyard president marc vigneron-larosa visited bottleneck , although both sides stress it was n't a diplomatic mission . 
    `` we are interested in establishing a relationship , '' says mr. vigneron-larosa . 
  as to the question of `` whether micro-nations have a future , '' he says : `` it goes without saying . '', 
  but not all ethnic enclaves become ghettos , and i think that raises the question about how much each side is responsible for the situation .

  the old name for it ( now used only when one wants to sound poetic ) is \u201e t\u00e2rgul ie\u0219ilor '' , meaning the same thing you said . 
  the comment i replied too :  it 's illegal in poland as well ( but not enforced usually ) . 
  see how the last part says exactly that :  ( but not enforced usually ), 
  romania : we have them . 
  just not us style . 
   weekly pay . 
  we do by month . 
  twice a month is not that uncommon in romania . 
  only in france they remain , the rest of the eu does either cash or card . 
  even in france a lot of places have `` we do n't accept cheques '' signs . 
  someone told me that it 's partially because there have been lots of cheques that bounced due to eastern europeans scammers . 
  romania too . 
  it was equally weird for hungarian speakers ( and others ) when france had a president named sarkozy . 
  lots of people around my home town pronounced his name `` in the hungarian manner ''  also , remember when the belgian pm was an italian ... 
   we can incoporate foreign words , but we will `` galicizing '' them . 
  just like the speaker did in the video above ? 
   compare how he pronounced the words with how a native english speaker would pronounce them . 
  let me tell you , that for a non-french native it 's not that easy to pick out the english words . 
   yes , there is everything dumb about it . 
  no there is n't . 
  it 's just your subjective opinion . 
   ask an iranian to mix farsi and english . 
  there are many languages that actively incorporate english words as we speak . 
  romanian for example , and it does n't make the language any less romanian , just like when we did it with french 150 years ago did n't . 
  and have you ever seen indian movies ? 
  ( they incorporate a lot more english )  ask a beninese to mix fongbe and finnish . 
  i have a feeling francophone colonies have a lot of french mixed into their vocabulary . 
   as i said to the other guy , there is a huge difference to use `` business '' instead of `` affaires '' or `` commerce '' etc. , and telling `` check '' instead of `` v\u00e9rifier '' . 
  there is no huge difference . 
  it 's just that you dislike one of them because they are newer and less established , and still perceive it as foreign . 
  that does n't make it `` wrong '' in any objective way . 
  from a top / r/mapporn comment   [ 2014 ] the ef epi fourth edition was calculated using test data from 750,000 test takers in 2013 . 
  ** the test takers were self-selected and no demographic information was collected on them ** . 
  the tests are used by the company for marketing and placement purposes . 
  [ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index ) ]  is the reason for percived inaccuracy  tl ; dr : bullshit methodology , it 's not an official index of any kind but random data from some site, 
   edit : here 's the psa : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n7qea39ego wow ... just wow !, 
   and they are right , either you speak french or english you know , french can incorporate foreign words and still remain french ...  i would find it equally dumb if i saw an englishman throwing random spanish words while he 's discussing . 
  there is nothing dumb about it , it 's just your absolutely subjective perception . 
  there is nothing inherently superior or better about linguistic purism .

  hate will find a way !, 
  basically the same in romania . 
  actually , the reddit autosuggest gives you this title :  a man 's facebook post about being ` disappointed ' after taking in 24 refugees is going viral , for good reason, 
  ah , for fuck 's sake . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  it 's the title * autosuggest * gave me . 
  it 's literally the article 's title . 
  yeah , there 's a mountain chain running through the middle of szeklerland ( gurghiu/g \u00f6rg\u00e9ny - harghita/hargita - baraolt/bar \u00f3t mountains ) and the more protesatant areas are in the western lowlands , while the catholic areas are in the higher areas and in the eastern valleys , which are more isolated from the main north-south ( trade ) routes . 
  ebihoreanul says oradea was 1000 strong, 
  ultimately , it derives from the same persian root as `` georgian '' , but i know what you mean . 
  used to be in romanian as well , but it changed to georgia in the post-communist period ( iirc , the georgians themselves asked not to be referred to as gruzia ), 
  gruzia has a nice ring to it imho , but i hear it 's not really popular . 
  [ riga coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/coat_of_arms_of_riga.svg/1280px-coat_of_arms_of_riga.svg.png ), 
  that 's a nice logo ... 
  also looks like a logo of a city with solid medieval history , which is what i associate the baltics with . 
  hanseatics and stuff . 
   and turkey is not in europe for a bingo !,

  central-european culturally , eastern-european going by cold-war ( geo ) politcs , often used as shorthand for `` post-communist '' . 
  that was croatia . 
  do the dsp get votes from non-turkish voters as well ? 
  i think voter apathy is a bigger danger ( udmr is seen as corrupt , and rightly so ) than diaspora voting or rival parties . 
  you have to remember that the romanian diaspora also includes ethnic hungarians , and it might even be that they are over-represented in the diaspora ( i think there was a tendency in the 1990 for hungarians to emigrate in larger percentage than ethnic romanians , at least judging by how the ethnic proportions in settlements changed between the 1992-2002 cesuses ) . 
   the democratic union of hungarians in romania party ( tho ' not officially a party ) most of the political parties representing minorities in parliament are n't really parties , but `` minority organisations '' like udmr ( most are `` union of ... '' or `` association of ... '' ) , something the law specifically allows . 
   here in romania every oficially recognised minority ( 18 in total ) gets one representative in the parliament actually 19 in total . 
  it 's just that the hungarians are the only ones that pass the 5 % threshold , so they get more than the 1 seat . 
  if they would score less , they would get only 1 seat . 
  the 18 one-seat deputies usually form the so-called `` group of national minorities '' in parliament , and act as a distinct bloc , while the hungarian party , being bigger , acts on its own . 
  another funny thing is that the slav word for germany ( `` niemcy '' ) ended up meaning austria in arabic . 
   how do you see european influence in the world  * postive , we should do ** more **  * postive , it should stay the way it is !, 
   * positive , but we should do ** more **  * ... 
  should n't one of these say `` we should do ** less ** '' ? 
  my hometown ( of oradea ) still has a klezmer band and they are quite good .
