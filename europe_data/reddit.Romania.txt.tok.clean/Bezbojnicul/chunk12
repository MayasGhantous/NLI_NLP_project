   i 'm afraid that we could end up like greece , bulgaria , romania etc. 
  after joining the eu . 
  i ca n't speak for the other two , but joining the eu was one of the best things to happen to us . 
  sure it has negative aspects , but the positives far outweigh the negatives imo . 
   it just seems odd to know someone for years and not know that . 
  i second this . 
  family and heritage is important where i live , and therefore it comes up in conversations from time to time , so not knowing this about a `` close friend for years '' feels weird to me as well . 
  the [ fleg in question ] ( http://cdn1.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article30397554.ece/3ca58/alternates/w620/img_2477.jpg ), 
  i think you are talking to the wrong person . 
   in my mind if you think that the government can tell individuals what not to wear , then you do n't hold freedom of expression as ~ ~ an ~ ~ * the most * important thing . 
  fixed . 
  some people prioritize rights/freedoms differently . 
   it seems that most people on r/europe think that it is appropriate for the state to tell individuals what not to wear . 
  people may feel that freedom of religious and/or of expression through clothing need to be balanced against other imperatives . 
   it is very disrespectful . 
  i think that was kinda the point . 
   it is very disrespectful not just to the eu but to europe as a whole . 
  i disagree tbh . 
   it turns out that a lot of people do n't really agree where the limit on freedom of expression should be put . 
  ftfy , since that 's what that thread was about . 
  the separation between language and dialect is very political . 
  afaik ( from my visit last year ) , spain has both free and distance-based tolls on highways,

   but in relation to nudity an argument can be made in relation to `` public decency '' . 
  that 's just as subjective as `` general dislike of niqabs '' . 
  what is `` public decency '' after all ? 
  maybe this will help : http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/europe-28087824, 
  yeah , sunbathing on roof-teraces of commie blocks is not unheard of here either ... 
  quick g!translation , for our non-hispanophone users :  the problem is that we are not responding to our democratic mechanisms , words of palo iglesias in the ep `` when a house does not represent its citizens , and when meps receive outrageous salaries compared to what normal people get the problem of the the presidency is not whether he is too weak or too strong , if he has a hammer or not , you need a minimum amount of decent democracy .

   send us a mod email ? 
  i dont think that 's a good idea.do it the same way we did it last time . 
  i think i kinda agree . 
  it 's more in the open the old way . 
  there is an even bigger [ east-west divide ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cbvw6jq.png ) .

  inflammatory discussions of dubious quality was threatening to balloon the comment sections with something that had little relevance to the video . 
  hello . 
  may i suggest asking in / r/askeurope as well , for better results . 
  romania is missing the claim on [ northern bukovina ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/ukraine-bukovyna.png ), 
  eliminating bigotry and encouraging quality posts our two of our stated aims , and in this particular case , they were clashing , so we reluctantly decided to be in favor of quality posting . 
  i imagined your previous comment to be one of surprise of seeing such a username here , given that you , being an old user , are familiar with our rules and guidelines . 
  the good quality of his posts is the only reason his username has n't gotten him ` deported ' from / r/europe . 
  goodbye . 
   you are cumans and turks who needed to create a history since everyone knows you do n't actually have one . 
  another post like this , and you get a temporary ban . 
  keep insulting shit like this in polandball, 
   between 1526 and 1867 , you disappeared completely , partitioned , disassembled , divided , kaput . 
  we never left anywhere , nor disappeared geopolitically . 
  you are factually incorrect , and you are comparing apples ( the hungarian state ) with oranges ( the romanian people ) . 
  it 's somewhat similar to arguing that germany did n't exist between 1945 and 1991 . 
  --  i , personally , have serious doubts whether nowadays hungarians are the same hungarians of the old kingdom before battle of mohacs ; since we 're talking blood . 
  please do n't start these kinds of conversations . 
  sorry for late feedback , been out of town the last 2 days . 
   please do n't be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us . 
   if we see this rule getting broken , we will give a warning and ban those who continue to engage in this type of behavior . 
  i think this should be something like ; * please do n't be rude , and please keep conversation on the topic , and do n't attack the other person . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us . 
  * conversations that consist of nothing but name-calling will be removed and the users warned and if the behavior persists banned ( temporarily and permanently ) . 
  also this should be there : * if a post is of good quality/well argumented , but you throw in a `` you 're a moron ! '', 
  we will still remove the comment until the insult is deleted . 
   do n't tag posts as `` x-post from '' in the headline . 
  all content linked on reddit comes from elsewhere . 
  where you originally saw content is not of general interest . 
  if you want to add such information do it in the comment section , not the title . 
  i 'm not convinced this is needed . 
  -- some other things : * besides self-nominations , i think the community should have the chance to nominate mods as well . 
  in fact , i highly encourage it , with the clear specification that the unltimate choice is still our . 
  i do n't think we should import mods from other subs . 
  it 's not like david was welcomed with open arms . 
  * it should be made clear that being arrogant with the mods will not get them unbanned . 
  * i think bans should take into account post history of the user ( maybe you all do this but just wanted to write it down just in case ) . 
  * i think we should at least answer the question `` why was i banned '' with the reason and the post which sparked the ban , even if we do n't answer after that . 
  i 'm willing to do it , if you guys do n't wan na . 
  * i think we should engage more with the community . 
  even giving public warnings more often could make us look more visible . 
  i get the feeling people do n't notice our work , and i would n't mind us getting a bit more sympathy from the community . 
  -- one last thing . 
  i have n't gotten the chance to familiarize myself with the moderator toolbox , so i ca n't really say anything about that yet . 
  thanks for doing this , and sorry again for not responding earlier . 
  -- from modmail :  do you know some interesting facts or stats that should be included ? 
  there were some moderation stats that got posted some time ago ~ ~ ( by david iirc ) ~ ~ * ( by you , in the post about / r/toolbox ) * . 
  i could make some data visualizations out of them , but it would take a couple of days . 
  ** le ** here , i finished early : http://imgur.com/a/wgf2z  ** lle ** some more : http://imgur.com/a/yfvnz ** llle ** found a [ 2-month-old muw request ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/muws/comments/2451tr/request_reurope/ ) for / r/europe . 
  made a wordcloud out of it : http://i.imgur.com/qrqvw4u.png, 
   i suspected that but thanks for confirming . 
  please do n't engage in stuff like this . 
  i 've removed your comments . 
  they will be undeleted as soon as you remove the personal attacks . 
   you fucking moron . 
  please do n't use personal attacks . 
  you can drive your point across without cursing . 
  thank you !,
