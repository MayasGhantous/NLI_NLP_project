  also important methinks :  muslim groups are not alone in their scepticism . 
  some lawmakers in cameron 's own party are uneasy at the measures , while counter-extremism experts say the message of militants should be challenged not banned . 
  david anderson , the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , has warned that any wrong decisions risked provoking a backlash in muslim communities and driving people towards extremism and terrorism . 
  food offered by the school ... lol . 
  we used to have two options : 1 . 
  whatever you brought from home 2 . 
  whatever you could buy from the school shop ( like a bretzel/salty cheeze pastry or regular junk food like chips , [ pufule\u021bi ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gcw4bqw.jpg ) and soft drinks ) that being said , if the school does offer food , it should try to accommodate the largest spectrum of people . 
  but pork is as central to being european as christianity and melanin deficiency ... 
  will probably try , come spring . 
  also we did bring a big stash of it in dried form . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  things that were/are surprisingly hard to find in france : * [ cofee pot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/ibrik_coffee_brewer_1.jpg ) ( my so found one in the end , marketed as `` milk heater pot '' ) * [ parsley root ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/wurzelpetersilie_wurzel.jpg ) . 
  we found lots of exotic vegetables that i did n't know existed , but no parsley root yet ( so we make due with [ parsnip ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/panais_au_march%c3%a9.jpg ) ) things that we knew had no chance of finding , which is a pity , because it 's awesome : * [ lovage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovage ) ( [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/liebst%c3%b6ckel.jpg ) ) - apparently it 's mostly a romanian-bulgarian favoured herb . 
  so any context ? 
  what are the issues , who 's who , all that jazz ? 
  we 're arriving friday night from nice , so we 'll have all saturday and a maybe half of sunday . 
  german one is definitely on the list as one of our friends worked as a structural engineer on some elements of the german pavilion , so he want to see his work in the flesh . 
  ps : any personal recommendations ? 
  we 're going this weekend ... :(, 
  yeah , dolmabahce was the definition of \u201e opulence , i has it ! '' , 
   rapesan does it involve tentacles ? 
  i think regional cooperation schemes could be implemented to work around these problems . 
  for example , metropolitan councils that work cross-border , to ensure such problems are streamlined . 
  the block in bra\u0219ov also pays municipal-level taxes , so those could be used for municipal needs . 
  i think thinking about the problem at the municipal level would work better than directly at the state level . 
  maybe some pan-european legal framework could be considered so that block do not have to negotiate everytime , but already have a framework for cooperation , at least for basic needs . 
  when constitutional law and the right of self-determination conflict , i think the later should be given precedent . 
  border revisions based on self-determination could save a lot of people a lot of grief , and is easily doable within the framework of the eu and schengen , to the level of individual buildings ( but it could be scaled up a bit , for example down to city blocks ) . 
  with borders nothing more than internal administrative divisions , you could have multiple-level enclaves baarle-hertzog/baarle-nassau style without much hassle . 
  also , i think the [ 1920 schleswig plebiscite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schleswig_plebiscites,_1920 ) is an example that should have been followed way more than it was . 
  to give an example , all hungarians could live in hungary if they wish without moving from their current residence . 
  but suggesting border revisions would give most people an instant nose-bleed ... 
  and it also has some very hip and \u201e western '' parts . 
  it a mix of everything . 
  i very much liked it . 
  except \u00c7ar\u015famba , fuck that place . 
  also , edirne felt even more european ( very similar to the cities in dobrudja ) . 
  good thing he did n't say anything about gypsies . 
  now * that * would have been unpopular . 
  statistics can be just dry facts that need interpreting , and it really depends on who is doing the interpreting , and what their biases are : statistic : * \u201e as opposed to the general public , only 25 % of roma children go to school beyond the 8 ^ th grade '' * ( a fictional statistic but the general idea is not far from the truth ) right-wing interpretation : \u201e even with all the programs in place , a high amount of roma do n't want to go to school '' / \u201e due tu culture , a high amount of roma do n't value education '' / \u201e due to their insular mentality , most roma do n't want their children to have anything beyond a basic level of education '' left-wing interpretation : \u201e a high amount of roma do n't reach highschool due to discrimination '' / \u201e a high amount of roma are too poor to afford sending their children to school beyond the 8 ^ th grade '' / \u201e due to a history of marginalisation , a high amount of roma do n't value education '' the fact is the same , the interpretation is not . 
   ( eastern european countries see it as throwing off the legacy of communism , for example ) there are tangible benefits for eastern european countries , starting from development and ending with geopolitics . 
  while there is a \u201e sentimental side '' of \u201e reconecting with europe '' , that alone is a minor reason for being pro-eu . 
  we are no more sentimental than the uk tbh . 
  / r/datavizrequests, 
  those evil muslim ukrainians ... 
   i would like to go back to my previous question and ask when/where did they actually become vlach/romanian ? 
  i did n't answer because i did n't really understand the question . 
  i do n't think there is a moment in time when a people starts to exist . 
  i agree with the rest , there is more ways than one to skin a cat . 
  i know , but unlike ladins they are a bit more tricky when it comes to continuity of calling themselves `` latin '' . 
  it was in the [ baltics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) . 
  i 'm not disputing that today 's hungarians are genetically central europeans , but historical narratives do n't focus on genetics that much now do they ? 
  and there is an unbroken chain of leaders that link the nomad hungarians to the medieval/christian hungarian state . 
   there also is no evidence that you could point at and say `` hey this must have been made by/this must account for romanians '' until deep into the middle ages . 
  that is again beside the point . 
  ** one 's european-ness is n't measured in how many artifacts you can connect to your name . 
  ** otherwise the saami hardly classify as europeans , not to mention bosnians , or albanians , or the g\u0103g\u0103uz ... and , as i said , it 's not like modern romanians came from another continent . 
  it 's accepted that they lived somewhere in the general area of the northern balkans , and and descend from latin speaker . 
  this is n't being disputed , even by people who claim they immigrated recently into transylvania . 
   i do n't think anyone can ever forget the sound of a pig screaming for its life , along with the gargling noises . 
  can confirm , it 's the one nasty part of the whole thing . 
  the scream chills your soul . 
   latin is very much alive today through the romance languages hell , some of them [ still call it latin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladin_language ) ... 
  nope . 
  no difference ^ ^ / s, 
   has had quite a few centuries of fighting in response to the ottoman empire . 
  we also do n't have a good track record of winning ...  we do forgive , but we do not forget . 
  images of a neckbeard vlad \u021aepe\u0219 flash before my eyes ... 
  basques would like a word with everyone ... 
   so that is the `` thank you '' from 2015 's western europe for trying to defend europe from the turks for centuries . 
  everybody from vienna to yerevan think they saved europe from the turks . 
  this bullshit is getting old . 
   the hungarian homeland is around the urals other ugric speakers live east of the urals , so probably proto-hungarians came [ from ] asia . 
   so technically we could say we have been in europe from 2000 + bc . 
  by the same technicality indo-europeans still have hungarians beat , and basques can tell everyone to get off their lawn . 
  even if the romanians migrated to transylvania long after the hungarians ( i 'm not arguing either way ) , that still does n't refute the original assertion that * romanians have deeper roots in european history than hungarians * , since they did n't bloody well came from africa , now did they ? 
  the original theory states that they came from south of the danube , which , correct me if i 'm wrong , is still in europe . 
  what a silly comparison ... 
  because this way it still has leverage to force serbia to put this issue to rest . 
  otherwise , it might drag on indefinitely , and maybe involve the rest of the eu too , if serbia enters with such a territorial dispute .

  [ 55 most common street names ] ( https://arnoldplaton.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graf55.png ) of urban ** romania **, 
  i think there is a difference in perception between east and west regarding these types of buildings . 
  i remember an interview with a french woman in a newspaper that said she was absolutely horrified by her first cab-ride from the airport to the hotel in cluj as it felt the city is composed entirely of what she perceived to be hgh-poverty-high-crime type buildings . 
  then she found out not only poor people live in blocks of flats in romania .
