  i know . 
  i have made the same subconscious connection myself some time ago ... , 
  your comment reminds me of when i visited turkey last year and took my first bus ride from istanbul to edirne . 
  we took front row seats , thus we could admire first hand the miracle that is turkish traffic and the talent that is embodied in the turkish bus driver . 
  found [ this map of how the border shifted ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/turkmanchai.jpg ), 
   however all of them will have some significant knowledge of arabic because all muslims learn passages of the koran written in arabic . 
  i doubt this is the case tbh . 
  just because they had to memorize some religious passages does n't mean they can understand a translation of the german constitution . 
  not to mention that coranic arabic is not exactly the same as modern standard arabic , which in turn can be very different from the various spoken \u201e dialects '' of arabic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_arabic  classical arabic ( ca ) , also known as quranic arabic , is the form of the arabic language used in literary texts from umayyad and abbasid times ( 7th to 9th centuries ) . 
  it is based on the medieval dialects of arab tribes . 
  modern standard arabic ( msa ) is the direct descendant used today throughout the arab world in writing and in formal speaking , for example , prepared speeches , some radio broadcasts , and non-entertainment content . 
  ** while the lexis and stylistics of modern standard arabic are different from classical arabic , the morphology and syntax have remained basically unchanged ( though msa uses a subset of the syntactic structures available in ca ) . 
  the vernacular dialects , however , have changed more dramatically . 
  ** also i took latin in school ( 7 years ) and i think i can still recite the [ first part of cicero 's first catiline oration ] ( https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/oratio_in_catilinam_prima_in_senatu_habita#i ) , but you should n't think i could read and understand a latin translation of the german constitution . 
  i saw a report on the news about the refugees in \u0218omcu\u021ba mare ( there is a refugee center there ) . 
  the folks in the small community had generally a positive attitude of the refugees and the refugees helped out with work when needed . 
  i think it did n't work ( kept returning error ) , that 's why i turned to scapetoad . 
  many plugins for qgis are kinda wonky . 
  scapetoad to do the cartogram and qgis for the other tinkering . 
  well , since you made the data available , here is a remake of the map side by side with a cartogram ( made based on the `` population of voters '' parameter as a proxy for total population ) . 
  est europe best europe !, 
   a heatmap with intensity linked to population density would be still more insightful . 
  or [ a cartogram ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/46481000/jpg/_46481865_spain.jpg ), 
  somebody made [ one for italy ] ( https://i.imgur.com/kxmoyiu.png ) already . 
  romanians also say `` germania '' for the country but `` neam\u021b '' for the man . 
  we have `` german '' as well , but the former is the one used most of the time . 
  yeah , i 'm 99 % sure we got it relatively recently and it 's not something kept from roman times . 
  edit . 
  the existence of the obsolete \u201e [ \u0218vi\u021bera ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/svi%c8%9bera ) '' and \u201e [ \u0219fi\u021beran ] ( https://dexonline.ro/definitie/%c8%99fi%c8%9beran ) '' leads credence to this . 
  did some quick research and it appears that both versions were used in the 19th century :  [ svi\u021bera ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yodtbst.png ) - in 1867 , in ia\u0219i - geografia generala a europe\u012d , asie\u012d , africe\u012d , americe\u012d \u015fi oceanie\u012d , cu no\u0163iuni preliminarie in geografie : pentru usulu claselor primare ( 13th edition ) by dimitrie gusti  [ elve\u021bia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y6kkm1w.png ) - in 1842 , in bucharest - anuarul prin\u021bipatului \u021a\u0103rii rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti, 
  welcome all you fine gentlemen . 
  i 'm especially delighted to see reilly in the inner circle . 
  congrats to the mod team for the exemplary way this was handled . 
  y' all deserve a tall glass of champagne . 
  absentees, 
  here 's [ a map for better visualisation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/un_resolution_of_palestine_as_observer_state.svg/1000px-un_resolution_of_palestine_as_observer_state.svg.png ) . 
  in 2008 there was a really noticeable transition when you crossed the greek-bulgarian border . 
  people started looking very grumpy once you crossed into bulgaria . 
  i 'm guessing the greeks have aquired some grumpyness too in the meantime . 
  because i , for one , welcome our new german overlords . 
  also , it 's shorter than \u201e culturally german-influenced central europe '' . 
  also , i 'm [ mitteleuropean ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/577px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) meself . 
  the balkans less emotional than mitteleuropa ? 
  damn you brussels bureaucracy !, 
  so does hungary and western romania . 
  today has been a beautiful sunny day here !, 
  add to that the fact that when modernity came around the corner , hungarians were mostly peasants ( or nobility ) , while the cities were inhabited mostly by germans and jews , which kinda confused the everyman that was starting to internalize the new ideology of nationalism and the nation state . 
  people migrating to the towns saw that liberal jobs ( lawyers , doctors ) were dominated by minorities , especially jews , and this created resentment . 
  sure , they did start to assimilate ( so much so that at one point jews , who spoke either hungarian or yiddish were referred to as hungarians or germans of jewish faith ) . 
  but still a lot of people felt that jews were not really hungarian-hungarians , and coupled with economic grievances , it burst out as anti-semitism . 
  the same was true in romania , in the interbelum . 
  cities in transylvania were dominated by hungarians , germans and jews ( most became majority romanian only in the 60s and 70s ) . 
  cities in northern moldova also had large jewish populations , as well as the capital , bucharest . 
  a century earlier , anti-greek sentiment was strong in moldova and wallachia , in a similar way . 
  simillar to how jews dominated certain profesions ( trade , law , medicine ) , the chinese dominate in southeast asia and indians in some former british colonies ( like fiji , and untill idi amin kicked them out , uganda ) . 
  these so called \u201e mercantile minorities '' often face race-riots and a general distrust by the local majority population . 
  i was expecting just some tatar or dagestani or some other muslim from the russian federation, 
    anvar azimov , the ministry 's point man on visa negotiations with the eu ,  is not russian and should be deported to where he came from . 
  what is he ? 
  by the name he sounds muslim . 
  same here friend . 
  yeah man . 
  the [ 2.22 million euros ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-13613883-guvernul-aloca-circa-10-milioane-lei-din-fondul-rezerva-pentru-lucrari-biserici.htm ) the government gave the church out of its own emergency fund surely bumped us up a spot or two . 
  at least we have jesus !, 
   i 'm pretty sure every single european nation has an equivalent of chavs . 
  yep . 
  they are called \u201e cocalar '' in romanians . 
  the female equivalent is \u201e pi\u021bipoanc\u0103 '' or just \u201e pi\u021bi '' . 
  shit just got real !, 
   ppdd is a pdl satellite any proof for this claim ? 
   dont say its nationalistic read what i said again, 
  i think it 's the same here as well . 
   does a pirate party exists ? 
  in embrionic status . 
  we actually have [ a pirate candidate ] ( http://www.facebook.com/aipentruce ) , but he 's running under the ecologist party, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/election_threshold  in sweden , there is a nationwide threshold of 4 % , but if a party reaches 12 % in one election district , it will be represented even if it does not reach the 4 % level nationally . 
  however , through the 2010 election , nobody has been elected based on the 12 % rule . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.facebook.com/mai.intai.oamenii ) seems more of an euro-left kinda guy than of the sort you describe, 
  we do , but they are insignificant . 
  both alliances trace their roots from the fsn and both have factions of pntcd . 
  no use playing holier than thou . 
   probably the only social-liberal party in europe nope . 
  there are also in : [ denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_social_liberal_party ) , [ belgium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociaal-liberale_partij ) , [ the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberal_party_\\ ( the_netherlands \\ ) ) , [ austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_social_liberals_\\ ( austria \\ ) ) and [ lithuania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_union_\\ ( social_liberals \\ ) ) ( to name only eu-members ) . 
  also , it 's not uncommon in western europe for liberal parties to form alliances with social-democratic ones . 
  i remember at the last uk elections how commentators were saying that a lib-dem + labour coalition is more natural than a lib-dem + tory . 
  curiosity . 
  i usually listen to radio rom\u00e2nia actualit\u0103\u021bi kind of by default when i drive , and in election seasons they play electoral messages , so i listen to whoever is blabbering to see what they have to say . 
   a lot of idiocy . 
  man , i was listening to ppdd candidates on the radio , and i have to say those were the most incoherent electoral messages i heard in my life . 
  they are center-left , but as in many places , the \u201e center '' is quite to the right on the political spectrum . 
   in order to participate in the elections at national level , a party must pay 2355 minimum monthly wages ( a bit over 400.000 $ ) . 
  actually , the rule is something like 5 minimum wages per candidate . 
  ( so a party can pay less than that , but yes , that is the sum needed to field candidates for all constitituencies )  even though it 's supposed to be a first-past-the-post system , there 's also a election threshold of 5 % , so if your party 's candidates win some districts , they wo n't get in the parliament if the party did n't get more than that threshold . 
  also , it 's only fptp if a candidate gets 50 % +1 of the votes . 
  if not , than the seat goes to the next round , where they are distributed on a proportional way . 
  here 's the system explained : http://www.bucharestlife.net/2012/10/18/romanian-electoral-system-explained/  pp-dd -- people 's party -- some idiotic nationalist party , founded by a talk show host at a gutter press tv station populist is the best way to describe them . 
  nationalist themes have n't featured that much in their message . 
   the result is that practically , in most places , there are only three candidates of those big ( and atrociously corrupt ) parties besides the 3 parties above ( actually 2 alliances and 1 party ) , you usually have the prm , the nationalists lunatics , and if you live in transylvania , you also have the traditional hungarian minority party , udmr , and the newer ( but more nationalist ) hungarian minority party , ppmt . 
  just remembered : ** the 5 % threshold is the largest in the eu . 
  damn those moldovan separatists , breaking off from the soviet union !!,
