  sutra hints to indian origins 3 . 
  in romanian , a \u201e \u0219atr\u0103 '' ( which is pronounced simmilarly [ * shut-ruh * ] ) means a gypsy tent or a bunch of these tents , making up a nomad gypsy community also any ideas for romanians or bulgarians or hungarians ? 
  i think it 's more of a rule of thumb thing, 
   because freedom of expression . 
  you mean freedom of assembly . 
  they can express themselves in the non-catholic districts of belfast too . 
  my question was why do they allow the parade to take place in ardoyne , not in general . 
   think westboro baptist church . 
  funny you should mention the wbc . 
  they too have restrictions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westboro_baptist_church#responses  on may 29 , 2006 , president george w. bush signed into law the respect for america 's fallen heroes act ( pub.l . 
  109-228 ) , prohibiting protests within 300 feet ( 91 m ) of the entrance of any cemetery under control of the national cemetery administration from 60 minutes before to 60 minutes after a funeral . 
  penalties for violating the act are up to $ 100,000 in fines and up to one year imprisonment . 
  the bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in congress with a 408 -- 3 vote in the house , with 21 not voting , and a unanimous vote in the senate . 
  and since we are talking about belfast , which is in the uk :  on february 18 , 2009 , two days before the intended picket date , the ** home office announced that fred phelps and shirley phelps-roper would be specifically excluded from entering the uk ** for having `` engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities '' , and that `` other church members could also be flagged and stopped if they tried to enter britain '' . 
   an alliance of six uk religious groups ( the baptist union of great britain , evangelical alliance uk , faithworks , methodist church of great britain , united reformed church and bible society-funded thinktank theos ) made a joint statement on february 19 , 2009 in support of the government 's decision and condemning the activities of the westboro baptist church, 
  what 's the general atmosphere nowadays up in ni ? 
  hum much tension is there , and what 's its trend ( increasing , decreasing , the same ) ? 
  what do you think should be done to further decrease tensions ? 
  not really . 
  similar to yugoslavia . 
   apparently there is an annual parade held by british unionists which leads through the catholic district of ardoyne and stirs up lots of trouble . 
  why the fuck would the local authorities allow such a parade ? 
  or if they allow it , why do n't the police outnumber and clearly separate the two sides ? 
  til . 
  is that why i got 4 downvotes ? 
  you is both for singular ( you personally ) or plural ( you people , you croatians ) . 
  as in  is that a thing in croatia ? 
  do you [ * croatians * ] pray a lot ? 
    do you pray a lot ? 
   some things i like to keep for myself , including religion . 
  i think he meant croatians in general . 
  found some serbian or croat news : http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_category=64&amp;nav_id=660646 also in english : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/gotovina-and-markac-found-not-guilty, 
   there were ethnic germans who were deported , but after romania switched sides . 
  part of a larger trend , but unlike other countries , not all germans were expelled after ww2 , only about half . 
  \u201e roma '' is the endonim used by them in their own language since forever ( and is a cognate with \u201e dom '' , the name middle-eastern gypsies us for themselves ) . 
  derivatives of \u201e atsiganos '' and \u201e egyptian '' are exonims used by others , and by some gypsies that have lost their language . 
  these are well documented facts . 
  false, 
  you really think the media would do such a thing ? 
  lie through omission like that ? 
   so the hungarians living in romania are also just romanians ? 
  yes , romanians in the sense of \u201e romanian nationals '' , not in the sense of \u201e ethnic romanians '' . 
   so , no need for minority rights , education in hungarian . 
  this does not follow the previous statement . 
  minority rights are given based on ethnicity , not nationality , and they are internal matters of romania . 
  in external matters , people ask for your passport ( i.e. 
  your nationality ) , not your ethnicity . 
  the german police does not care what ethnicity somebody is , they care about nationality , so they know where to deport your ass . 
  that 's what any mildly secular dictator claims when they try to get legitimacy for a crackdown on dissent/rebelion . 
  also , love [ this image ] ( http://counterpsy.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bashar.jpg ) from your link . 
  at least in romania , romas had it better during communism than now . 
  the state housed them and forced them to go to work ( just like they forced everybody ) . 
  communism fell , and the first ones to get laid off once the factories started going bust were the romas . 
  except for presidential and semi-presidential systems , the executive branch is not directly elected by the people , and even then , the prime minister is usually appointed , then confirmed by mps ( except in the us , where there is no pm ) . 
  it 's not the habit to popularly vote cabinet members individually , and i suspect it has to do with the need of the executive to function as a team . 
  also , when one says \u201e representative '' it usually means mps , which are always voted by the population , including the meps , or the head of state , which may or may not be popularly elected , depending on the system . 
  i think it 's extremely rare , and thus kinda misleading , to refer to ministers as \u201e representatives '' . 
  i 'd really rather we did n't . 
  great to hear !, 
  i think this is the aussie / kiwi perspective : http://flourish.org/upsidedownmap/hobodyer-large.jpg, 
  actually i was n't generalizing anything . 
  i was comparing the eu with a political system that : a. he is familiar with b. is generally considered democratic and unless you can provide an example of people directly electing ministers , i 'm not going to consider that a benchmark that separates democracies from non-democracies . 
  [ evidence nr . 
  1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10gjll/the_story_of_a_forthcoming_parliamentary_coup/ ), 
   you not knowing any democracy is no reason to discount his want for one in europe . 
  i did n't say i do n't know any democracies . 
  i said i did n't know any democracies in which the people elect the ministers . 
   your point ca n't be attacked because the country you were born into has a policy , that 's a generalisation , possibly the worst i 've seen actually it 's a * tu quoque * , but it does make a point  dae uk bad ??? 
  i 'm starting too think you have comprehension problems , as you seem to have missed my point entirely . 
  being that his argument is that he did n't vote for any commissioner , and commissioners are analogous to ministers ( at a national level ) his argument is ludicrous . 
  in no democracy that i know of does the population elect the ministers . 
  they are usually appointed by the prime minister and confirmed by parliament . 
  it 's even more ludicrous when one realizes that in the uk , it 's the queen - not a very democratic figure iirc - who appoints the prime-minister ( sure , she respects the election results and the subsequent interparty-negociations , when needed ) . 
  by comparison , commissioners are appointed by national councils , which are voted on by the people , and approved by the ep , which again , is democratically elected . 
  sure there is valid criticism to the whole eu system , and plenty of it . 
  his , unfortunately is hardly that . 
   no one attacks him because he 's catholic ( a lot of europe is ) , includig iirc our beloved president herman van rompuy, 
   christians in europe is higher than your poll , it 's 76,2 % is that all of europe or just the eu ? 
  you know what ? 
  i 'll take the private train from oradea to cluj over the public one any day of the week . 
  it 's half the price . 
  have you voted for the minister of [ whatever ] of the uk ? 
  from the article :  the vast majority of european citizens today are christians . 
  ermm , nope : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_eu  eurostat 's eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 48 % of eu citizens did not believe in god . 
   the eurobarometer poll 2005 found that , on average , 52 % of the citizens of eu member states state that they believe in a god , 27 % believe there is some sort of spirit or life force while 18 % do not believe there is any sort of spirit , god or life force . 
  3 % declined to answer . 
  and i 'm willing to bet those nonbeliever numbers wave gone up since 2005 . plus the fact that the 52 % who believe in \u201e god '' also includes the muslim and ( religious ) jewish minorities, 
  got this off the ep facebook page : http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152476638395107&amp;set=a.188069385106.246713.178362315106&amp;type=1  tonio borg could soon be responsible for creating laws that will affect the lives of millions of europeans if he is appointed as health and consumer affairs commissioner . 
  before this happens , parliament will submit him to an intense grilling to assess his suitability . 
  watch the hearing live today at 15:00 cet @ http://epfacebook.eu/bf < http://epfacebook.eu/bf&gt; and tell us , what would you ask him ? 
   watermelons with a spoons is a genius idea !, 
  i will consider it next time it is . 
  we had no halloween and pumpkins when i was a child , so now and again i would carve up a watermelon . 
  ate the inside with a spoon . 
  sometimes people actually do talk about religion over on / r/atheism ( and i do n't mean in the usual hurr durr kind of way ) . 
   plus , we do n't have to elect them neither do some parliamentary republics ( the parliament does ) . 
  i feel ya . 
  interesting article , albeit the \u201e euro '' part of it is quite small . 
  i know , just adding some extra info to your extra info . 
   unlike many other eastern european countries , our constitution does n't define marriage as being between a man and a woman afaik , the civil code defined marriage as \u201e the union between spouses '' untill recently , when it was changed to \u201e the union between a man and a woman '' precisely as an anti-gay marriage move,
