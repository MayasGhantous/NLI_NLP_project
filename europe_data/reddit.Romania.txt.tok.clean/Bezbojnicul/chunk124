  i know . 
  bad choice of words . 
  ( although i think they meant it as \u201e people from what is now serbia '' more then \u201e ethnic serbians '' ), 
  also : [ jewelry & female figurines made by early serbians known to will go on display in germany - the 8,000-yr-old female figurines are of rock worn smooth by water . 
  others are made clay & bone . 
  the ` belica hoard ' was found in an early neolithic settlement earlier this year ] ( http://www.alphagalileo.org/viewitem.aspx?itemid=125649&amp;culturecode=en ), 
  pm me 4 romania, 
  the [ op ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/12v3tq/deptor_rate_overindebted_per_county_in_germany/c6yclj3 ) over there :  more informations/infographics at [ spiegel online ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/schuldneratlas-zeigt-wieder-anstieg-der-ueberschuldeten-in-deutschland-a-866036.html ) ( german language ) ( i speak no german , so maybe some of our german-speakers can give us more info ) also , obligatory * \u201e central germany , pay your debts ! '' *, 
  there are many chinese in hungary too . 
  are n't there sites that can automatically add `` badges '' to photos . 
  maybe we could automatically add a legend . 
  i 'd search and do it myself but i 'm at work . 
  i think most people like russians , but dislike russian politics abroad , especially in its neighborhood, 
  no , thank * you * czech republic !, 
  i can confirm this . 
  unfortunatelly not all gypsies share all or any or gypsy culture . 
  also i heard that progressives also tend to be against racism and for multiculturalism . 
  i 've never heard \u201e viking '' be referred to as \u201e a profession '', 
   i thought it was a totally bizarre question as it forced you to `` rate '' an entire race . 
  hehe . 
  some would say it 's not a race , but a culture , and `` rate '' it negatively in a heartbeat . 
  we sent that section to belarus for the vote-counting, 
   see gypsy as a ** profession ** rather than a race . 
  \u201e socio-cultural group '' might be more appropriate, 
  we either have 17 roma ( aka gypsies ) , or some romanians did n't pay attention to the answers . 
  it 's also interesting how london seems to have the opposite effect . 
  interesting how paris sucks innovation from the surrounding area . 
  zelko 's , right ? 
  just the copts do that . 
  yep . 
  his ancestors are from yugoslavia . 
  not sure is serb or croat or what http://wild-rooster.com/serbian-documentary-carries-a-message-of-peace/  former us pilot dale zelko -- whose grandparents came from yugoslavia -- spoke of the mixed emotions he felt before making his trip to serbia . 
  on the other hand , the \u201e serb who shot him down '' - zoltan dani - is an ethnic hungarian . 
  oh look , the iron curtain is visible ... ( kinda . 
  czechia and slovenia and estonia seem to be catching up to the west ), 
  so that everybody gets a piece of the pie and shares in the importance, 
   no wonder the sunnis consider them heretics . 
  if you 're aware of they way shia come to be i 'm sure you realize sunnis practice a less adulterated form of islam . 
  actually , [ ijtihad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijtihad ) fell out of favour in sunni islam way after the sunni/shia split . 
  you 'd make an excellent salafi cleric , 
   fundamentalists are the purest manifestation of islam , their version of islam is the closest to the original and thus the most genuine . 
  actually , the fundamentalists you see are a modern innovation . 
  they are as close to the original as neo-protestant \u201e non-denominational '' christians are to the original christians . 
  any kind of \u201e return to the golden age '' movement sees just a romanticised version of the past it seeks to recreate , not the real thing . 
  also , religious innovation is indeed frowned upon in sunni islam , but in shiite islam , it 's not . 
  the islamic republic system of iran is one such innovation . 
  but we 'll have to talk about this some other day . 
   i still have this apparently unreasonable expectation that people practice what they preach . 
  should n't i take people at their word ? 
  it 's unreasonable when you take words at their face value . 
  most religious adherents are hypocrites , as you say , because picking and choosing is elementary to religion . 
  so having the expectation that everybody actually a literalist believer is kind of naive . 
  anyway , i 'm off to bed . 
  no , ali is a fundamentalist and ahmed a liberal muslim . 
  you do not get to choose who can call himself a muslim , and you do not get to choose what \u201e real islam '' is . 
  all religions are self-contradictory , so everybody chooses what to follow and what to ignore . 
   a religion islam , its teachings , all the theoretical stuff . 
  i do not subscribe to the idea that islam is what muslims do . 
   its manifestations how ( and what part of ) that theoretical stuff menifests itself at any given point . 
  a religion usually has a shitload of comandments , teachings , and so on . 
  at any point in time , in a group of adherents , certain comandments/teachings will be followed while others will be ignored . 
  this is dependant on external factors . 
  so islams 's manifestations is what people chose to follow form the religion . 
   adherents people who self-identify as muslims . 
  many usually take the crooked logic that everybody who self-identifies as muslim is a follower of islam , and a follower of islam is necessarily one who obeys wholeheartedly all the teachings ( a fundamentalist ) , as islam is something rigidly defined . 
  therefore , everybody who self-identifies as muslim is a staunch follower of islam . 
  ( i 'm a bit tired , so sorry if i 'm not 100 % clear ), 
  6000 jews in romania ( out of 19 milion ) but negative stereotypes are still widespread . 
  yeah , we need an equivalent for [ `` holiday christian '' ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=holiday%20christian ) . 
   judging a person based upon their chosen belief system is n't such a ridiculous idea . 
  well , i think calling it \u201e chosen '' might be a bit misleading . 
  it 's not as if people grow up in neutral environment and at age 18 they make a choice . 
  people who convert , i.e. 
  actively choose a religion , are a small fraction , while other people \u201e inherit '' ( for lack of a better word ) their religion . 
  plus the fact that one 's religion may say very little about a man . 
  ahmed , who considers himself a muslim , but eats pork , drinks alcohol and does not give too many fucks about praying 5 times a day is a different kind of muslim than ali who builds his entire worldview around a literal interpretation of the koran . 
   you can hate a religion without being a racist . 
  you can . 
  i 'm not disputing that . 
  i 'm not a fan of islam myself . 
  but a lot of times people do not distinguish between a religion , in the abstract sense , its manifestations ( from the mild to the extreme ) and it 's adherents . 
  heard of him , have n't studied him in detail . 
  always seemed a bit too on the right socially . 
  but i 'll keep an eye out for him, 
  but you can be xenophobic towards adherents of a religion , and racist towards foreigners from muslim countries , no ? 
  i like these guys . 
  still on, 
  well [ you can jump in anytime ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12aj6n/serbia_macedonia_leaders_to_tackle_church_row/ ), 
  i think the difference between \u201e slavic neighbors '' and \u201e greek neighbors '' is negligible . 
  but my point was that conflating language and culture is really simplistic . 
  you seem to confuse/conflate culture with language . 
  who do you think romania is closer to culturally : a. 
  its balkan , mostly orthodox and mostly slavic neighbors b. 
  the other latin countries ( that are catholic and western european ) ? 
  second question : who is israel closer to culturally : a. 
  other semitic speaking countries , like saudi arabia , jordan , or egypt b. 
  western liberal democracies ? 
   if the fyrom slavs had maintaned the ancient macedonian culture and customs just like greeks maintained polytheism and pederasty ? 
   you cant claim a heritage because you invaded the land . 
  first of all the current inhabitants of macedonia are a mix of pre-slavics and slavic invaders .
