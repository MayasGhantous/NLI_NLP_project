  just because the slavic element assimilated the others does not mean that they all are descendant of invaders , as you so simplistically put it . 
  just like greeks are descendant not only from the greek invaders , but also from the local populations , like the minoans and whatever , that they mixed with . 
  hey , i though we were the poorest !, 
  you would n't believe how many nations have silly stories like this . 
  and i agree that macedonian history is full of silly things , but the sooner people leave them alone , the sooner they outgrow these myths by themselves . 
  now , being under attack , they rally around this false history . 
  everybody needs to chill the fuck out . 
   to make it up let me show you the only two words i learned from my trip to bucuresti : pofta buna . 
  just in time . 
  i 'm off to eat , 
   at least now they have a legitimate ** region ** to hate bulgarians freudian slip ? 
  yeah man . 
  and we should totally call greece \u201e new greece '' , not to confuse it with pederastic \u201e old greece '' , or bulgaria \u201e slavic bulgaria '' , to differentiate it from the non-slavic bulgars that invaded modern day bulgaria , but were turkicn not slavic , like the balkars in the caucasus , who are probably another branch of the turkic bulgars of old . 
  and the nerve on azerbaidjan , not calling itself \u201e north azerbaidjan '' . 
  iran must be terrified that they might have territorial claims towards the iranian province of azerbaidjan . 
   examples that do n't match ? 
  no analogy is perfect . 
   you obviously have n't heard some of the stuff they 're saying . 
  who ` se `` they '' . 
  the state or the people ? 
   some even claim that all white people come from macedonians . 
  some romanians [ do too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) , or think that the latins descended from the dacians . 
  a lot of greeks think \u201e everything comes from the greeks '' because a lot of words used today internationally have greek etymologies . 
  yeah , modern greeks totally share the culture of the ancient greeks . 
  i mean pederasty and polytheism is just as rampant as it was 2000 years ago . 
  and do n't even get me started on country names . 
  modern ghana does not overlap with medieval ghana in any way , benin has zero connection with the benin empire , mauretania is named after a kingdom that existed much more to the north , cambodia is named after a state in india and there was no such thing as a \u201e pakistani '' identity before the middle of the 20th century . 
  they were indians . 
  there is no distinction between moldavia and moldova in the romanian language . 
  we just call one \u201e our moldova '' and the other \u201e republic of moldova '' , \u201e moldova from beyond the prut ( river ) '', 
   macedonians did n't exist back then all national identities are ideological creations starting from around the middle of the 19th century . 
  also , had we not joined together , we could have blocked bulgaria over the [ asan dinasty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asanesti#origins ) that ruled the second bulgarian empire, 
  claiming copyright on history is equally stupid . 
  and if one can be greek and slavic at the same time ( as [ slavophone greeks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavophone_greeks ) seem to proove ) , one can be macedonian and slav . 
  and in case you have n't noticed , the french have a germanic ethnonim , and the bulgarians have a turkic one . 
  actually , gheorghe doja is acnowledged as a szekely , not an ethnic romanian , but history focuses on the social aspects ( the people vs the upper class ) of his fight , not the ethnic ones . 
  but moromete 's origins were unknown to me . 
  good one  also , dimitrie cantemir is claimed by the romanians , the russians , the turks ( cantemiroglu ) and probably the moldovans too . 
  yeah , because greece is acting like a child, 
  the area of moldova is now part of 3 countries : republic of moldova , romania and ukraine . 
  only 1 uses the name . 
  the area of luxemburg is divided between the grand duchy of luxembourg and the belgian province of luxembourg . 
  as a romanian , i can confirm that matthias corvinus , the greatest king of hungary ( if i 'm not mistaken ) is also claimed by romania , together with his father , john hunyady, 
  silvio , business as usual, 
  hello my fellow bihoranian !, 
  they also might be related to the [ t\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartaria_tablets ) and the [ vinca script ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin%c4%8da_signs ) . 
  man this is exciting . 
  there is a difference between \u201e having a language '' and \u201e having writing '' . 
  think about it . 
  i agree that it 's about many factors , not just the electoral system, 
   and what about mr. putin ? 
  russia is generally considered an authoritarian state , not a full blown dictatorship, 
  did n't france use proportional representation about 10 years ago , then everybody freaked out that the front national got a lot of seats , and switched back to the old system ? 
  i do n't know about that . 
  it 's known that a fptp system moves the political landscape towards a 2 party system , while a list system , like in the netherlands or israel favours political fragmanteation ( 5-6-whatever no . 
  of parties ) . 
  so it 's more than just the electorate . 
  come on . 
  the vatican is a weird fucking state . 
  it 's more of a corporation hq that got recognized as an independent state . 
  does it even have an actual population . 
  like civilians , or is it just clergy walkin around ? 
  while this is true , eastern europe is a bit more to the right than western europe ( due to recent history ) . 
  we are scared of the extreme left , while they are more scared of the extreme right . 
  he 's portuguese ( if i remember corectly ) , but with a chinese flair, 
  to be fair , polling only north-western europe makes this poll a bit problematic . 
  eastern europe would probably have given a few extra points to romney . 
   the democracy is defined by the constitution , but who defends the constitution ? 
  the million dollar question in any democracy . 
  i do n't know . 
  who defends it in germany , switzerland , poland , italy or the us ? 
   if the military is conscripted by the people how is it \u201e conscripted * by * the people '' ? 
   the turkish military has defended the republic many times and turkey is no military dictatorship . 
  it has been at times . 
  and that in itself makes this system highly debatable . 
  see : http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/24/the_historical_blindness_of_turkeys_detractors?page=full  in my country , the king is supposed to defend the constitution and he is the leader of the armed forces and the church . 
  yeah , but the monarchy is not really a shinning example of a democratic institution . 
  i 'm a fan of \u201e byzantium '' myself, 
  somewhat ontopic , there was [ an interesting article in the bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8675063.stm ) when coalition negociations were going on in the uk and i found it interesting how much anxiety that period of uncertainty produced in the british public and media . 
  i always get the feeling that at least part of the hate towards nick clegg is because his electorate , not used to coalitions , had too big expectations of him . 
  actually , i think most european states have a negative view of the millitary having any say in politics . 
  so erdogan might be right on this one . 
   if democratically elected ( like hitler ) then the burden lies to the entire state regardless who they voted for . 
  1 . the nsdap never received a majority of votes until after hitler was already named chancelor by hindemburg . 
  therefore it 's debateable if hitler was \u201e democratically elected '' 2 . 
  the burden may lie on \u201e the state '' , but \u201e the state '' is not synonymous with \u201e the population '' . 
   btw check what i found : you found revisionist history . 
  i 'm not even going to bother watching it . 
  interesting . 
  maybe lwow should have been included in post ww2 poland . 
  anyway , i can see an interesting parallel with transylvania . 
  in 1918/1920 when it became incorporated into romania , all nearly its major cities were inhabited by hungarians , and it was a historically extremely important part of the kingdom of hungary . 
  on the other hand , most of the population was romanian . 
  most major cities became romanian-majority in the 60s and 70s . 
  t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 is still 50/50 , with the romanians achieving a slight majority in 2002 . 
  to be fair , you were n't the majority there to begin with , so the analogy breaks down a bit http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/poland1937linguistic.jpg, 
   i suppose that since germany started the war this is a form of justice . 
  so ethnic cleansing against civilians is ok , if the state fucked up ? 
  so , let 's say that if golden dawn gets in power in greece and they start a war with tukey , then turkey can ethnically cleanse western thrace of greeks , regardless of the fact that not everybody there is a neo-nazi ? 
   the expulsions of the germans were ( from what i gather ) largely peaceful , not a genocide ( like the armenian genocide ) yeah , ethnic cleansing is a-ok if it 's not accompanied by genocide .
