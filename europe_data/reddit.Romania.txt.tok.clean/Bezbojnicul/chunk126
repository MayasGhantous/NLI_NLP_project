   an excuse to pass some unpopular laws . 
  what laws ? 
  ( i 'm genuinely curious ), 
   there could be some other form of compensation . 
  \u201e some form of compensation '' is quite different from \u201e to give back stolen territories ''  i am not familiar the the poland issue you mention . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_from_poland_during_and_after_world_war_ii actually , this happened [ all over europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_after_world_war_ii ) . 
  actually , the [ benes decrees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ) , which ethnically cleansed czechoslovakia of sudeten-germans , are still in effect . 
  we also have problem with looting , but i do n't really know to what extent . 
  although i do n't think it 's as bad as in bulgaria . 
  interesting bit , the one about the orphic mysticism . 
  thanks for the info . 
   also the tartaria tablets [ 1 ] were found in transilvania , romania . 
  they found something similar recently . 
  [ a ceramic fragment with writing from before 6000 bce ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/1/1706/10268882/2/descoperire-arheologica.jpg?height=451&amp;width=600 ) ( among other things ) . 
  it just made the news in romania . 
  will post the translated article later on / r/europe, 
   demographic realities ? 
  what about justice ? 
  should half of poland be given back to the germans ethnically cleansed after ww2 ? 
  some more info/pics : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2224702/residents-europes-oldest-town-sliced-dead-half-buried-pelvis-up.html ( inb4 daily mail sucks ) also , some more archeological news from bulgaria : [ looters strip bulgaria of ancient treasures ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/aleqm5htbdepk28o6dksrkkbrtuz_ity3w?docid=fe7e6330a2a9438c9745b5d5d08a4c5d ) :(, 
  fun fact : the name istambul has a greek etymology . 
   etymologically , the name \u0130stanbul ( turkish pronunciation : [ is\u02c8tanbu\u026b ] , colloquially [ \u026fs\u02c8tambu\u026b ] ) derives from the medieval greek phrase '' \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' ( pronounced [ is tin \u02c8polin ] ) , which means `` in the city '' or `` to the city '' . 
  also , the name got officially changed to istambul only in the 1920s . 
   but we 're not exactly europeans . 
  and not arabs or persians . 
  turks originate from north of china , then on the way we became muslims ( the pay was good  ) . 
  yeah , but a lot of the modern turks are just the pre-turkic inhabitants of anatolia ( greeks and whatnot ) that got turkified . 
  so in that sense you 're as european as greece , or georgia , or armenia , you just have islam instead of christianity . 
  but so do albanians and bosniaks , and rarely do people say they are not european . 
  hungarians ( magyars ) came from east of the urals ( therefore from asia ) , but nobody says they are n't european . 
   and we already see the outcome of this in various metrics , from politics to how many books are being sold yearly . 
  do you happen to know what is the number of books read/bought per capita in turkey ? 
  also , thank you for your post . 
  really insightful . 
   changed the demographics of kosovo afaik a lot of those serbs resettled north , and serbified vojvodina . 
  anyway , a lot of european regions have different demographics than 100 years ago . 
   kosovo was part of serbia since ever , it 's even considered the `` cradle '' of serbia . 
  transylvania holds a similar role in the history of hungary . 
  i think you mean islamist , not islamic, 
   let a free kurdistan be created , why ? 
  you can have a democratic turkey that respects minority right without creating a region called kurdistan  give back stolen territories to the armenian people today 's demographic realities make this obsolete, 
  the same for romania and the rest of the balkans, 
  also invite turkey to invade half of eastern europe and break italy and germany the fuck up . 
  it will be like the good old days ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe  eastern europe is the eastern part of the european continent . 
  the term has widely disparate geopolitical , geographical , cultural and socioeconomic readings , which makes it highly context-dependent and even volatile , and there are `` almost as many definitions of eastern europe as there are scholars of the region '' . 
  [ 1 ] a related united nations paper adds that `` every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct '' . 
  by some definitions they are . 
  your sarcasm detector is malfunctioning but , if you insist : http://www.george-damian.ro/la-chisinau-se-cere-moldova-mare-2519.html * ( disclaimer : i know this is a fringe group ) *, 
  or just \u201e former ancient greece '', 
  because the balkans , that 's why !, 
   it is somewhat difficult to identify jokes are you german ? 
   kings of old countries were cousins all european nobles were related through marriage . 
  moldovan rulers were related , through family ties with other states as well besides wallachia ( poland , hungary , etc. ), 
  i do not deny the shared history of wallachia and moldavia . 
  nor the fact that ethnic romanians feel kinship across political boundaries . 
  my point is that it 's anachronistic to call being part of the medieval principality of moldavia \u201e being part of romania '' . 
  romania did not exist prior to the mid 19th century ( 1859 ) . 
  by that time , what is today the republic of moldova was already a russian province for almost 50 years . 
  the two peoples are more alike than both nations are willing to admit . 
  is joke . 
  i 'm actually not insulted and agree with eu pressure on our political system . 
  sure , no problem . 
  it 's one of those weird regions that \u201e moved around '' a lot on the map . 
  what can i say . 
  / r/balkanworldproblems, 
   culturally we are closer to romania ( following being part of it for longer than being soviet ) . 
  depends on what you understand as romania . 
  what is now the republic of moldova was part of romania only between ww1 and ww2 . 
  before that they were part of tsarist russia , and before that ( pre 1812 ) they were part of the principality of moldavia , and there was no state called romania . 
   but turkish culture is most certainly very different from any european country i 've experienced . 
  well , it feells like greece culture , but instead of orthodox christianity you have islam . 
   have co-opted ancient greek culture to give themselves a sense of identity well , modern greeks have done this as well . 
   the greeks argue that recognizing a country called macedonia bordering its province called macedonia can open territorial pretensions . 
  just like the republic of moldova borders the romanian region of moldova , and totally wants to annex it ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldova_ ( disambiguation ), 
  [ historic macedonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/expansionofmacedon.jpg/602px-expansionofmacedon.jpg ) ( alexander the great 's home state ) was more or less inside greece 's current borders . 
  what your map shows is the \u201e region of macedonia '' , which is greater than ancient macedonia . 
  like most of this stuff in balkans , this is complicated . 
  so read up : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( region ), 
   only those in moldavia and [ transylvania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/evromare1930.png/797px-evromare1930.png ) , but they got holocaust 'd by the hungarian authorities, 
   what more do you want from us germany ?!, 
  our firstborn and our souls !, 
   the eu , they argue , does not need another romania . 
  could you send us back all the romanian professionals working there ? 
  kthnxbai, 
  well , tunisia has the greatest chances on coming out ok of this whole transition to democracy, 
  occupy switzerland !, 
   we need to rebuild the eu or at least fix some of the leaks ( i.e. 
  problems with democratic legitimacy , bureaucracy and so on ), 
  maybe . 
  i think cyprus , with its separatist region , is the closest thing to a country at war in the eu . 
  western balkans , moldova , turkey , georgia , armenia , azerbajdjan , ukraine , belarus - once they : a. sort their shit out with their neighbors and their separatist regions b. get democratic and embrace a european direction ( moving towards the common values ) also switzerland , norway and iceland can join anytime . 
  also , the idea of russia influencing the eu if it joins by sheer numbers ( 143 mil . ), 
  is at least as scary as turkey doing that ( 75 mil . ) . 
  maybe they should join together , to cancel each other out . 
  maybe israel too if it got its shit together . 
  but i find that israel , the ex-ussr and turkey have a pretty slim chance ( i.e. 
  almost none whatsoever ) . 
  ** i have always found the idea of [ capeverdean accesion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#cape_verde ) interesting , and i 'm not sure i 'd be against it . 
   the dialects of romanian are barely mutually intelligible with the standard , and some can be counted as separate languages ; these include megleno-romanian ( meglenitic ) and istro-romanian , both of which are nearly extinct , and the more vigorous aromanian .
