  http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/508379/romance-languages/74696/italian#toc74697  mutual intelligibility between the major dialects is difficult ; the megleno-romanian , istro-romanian , and aromanian are sometimes classed as languages distinct from romanian proper , or daco-romanian , which has many slightly varying dialects of its own . 
  http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/508587/romanian-language#ref287507  romanian and aromanian are mutually more intelligible than most accents of the same language . 
  take a man from alabama and a man from wales , their accents/dialects are less distant then romanian and aromanian do you have anything to back this up , or is it just your opinion ? 
   whereas i easily understood 90 % of what she was saying in that song . 
  i think that if that 's the case , that you are not representative for the majority of daco-romanian speakers, 
  also , his far-right party does n't even have mp in the romanian parliament, 
  good point, 
  what kind of european are you ? 
  hungarian first line reads : `` this book belongs to sivak jozsef '', 
  or just get with the program and put russia like everybody east of the iron curtain :p, 
  from what some of the serbian reditors told me , the same is true with timok vlachs versus vojvodina romanians . 
  only the latter group sees itself as romanian . 
  the greek state does not recognize minorities everybody is greek . 
  some are `` vlach-speaking greeks '' ( aromanians and meglenoromanians ) , some are `` slavophone greeks '' ( macedonian slavs and bulgarians ) some are `` muslim greeks '' ( turks ) and so on . 
  see this thread , for the perspective of a `` slavophone greek '' : http://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/xrn6q/any_greeks_out_there_who_can_answer_a_couple/c5p7n1o, 
  also , greek vlachs , and all aromanians in general , speak a languaage that is uninteligeable to romanians proper . 
  we like to call it a dialect of romanian but its a different language imo . 
  see the text here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm6tfzvtmx0 ( first line is aromanian/vlach the second line is romanian proper ), 
  although they do believe they may have a different origin , most of them self-identify ethnically as hungarians ( which is a mixed ethnicity of many assimilated things anyway ) . 
  source : half my family is szekely, 
  szekely is not so much an ethnicity as a strong subethnic iidentity . 
  motherf ...  ), 
  more like : * germany * deutchland * allemania * shwabia * saxonland * niemecia * tedeschia * merkelland and so on ... 
  hetero-male-atheist , but central/southeast european , employed and in late 20s . 
  i found the `` mediterranean '' weird , as i understood it as essentially the same as `` romance '' , but most romanians would n't consider themselves mediterranean . 
  no biggie though, 
   marriage has , at least in my country , religious connotation . 
  on account the fact that you lack a flair , what country would that be ? 
  what are you ? 
  greek ? 
  that word is canceuroous, 
  north europa beste europa, 
   seriously , it 's beyond me how someone , especially someone living in the former east , can honestly compare the eu with the ussr . 
  you 're not the only one ... 
  i like that word . 
  `` euro-curious '' . 
  nice and neutral . 
  gays already have [ a memorial in berlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memorial_to_homosexuals_persecuted_under_nazism ) and two more in other cities . 
  i 'm sure the others will as well in the near future . 
  also , [ a comemorative plaque in berlin ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/a_plaque_set_in_the_pavement_at_no_4_tiergartenstrasse.jpg/576px-a_plaque_set_in_the_pavement_at_no_4_tiergartenstrasse.jpg ) for the disabled people , near tiergartenstrasse nr . 
  that too, 
  so brave !, 
  romania ? 
  bulgaria ? 
  other non-eu european countries ? 
  i 'm not sure i 'd recommend coming by bike . 
  maybe train or bus/car . 
  regarding the redditor meetup though , i 'm not too keen on befriending romanian redditors , to be honest . 
  anyway , i 'll give you a tour of the local sights if you 're interested in architecture , including the fort , if you stop by . 
  may i ask what kind of volunteer work you 'll be doing ? 
  nice . 
  i live in oradea , so not that far away . 
  if you 're ever in oradea , pm me in advance , and we might grab a beer , 
   you meet them at school , you work with them , you share your neighborhood , etc. 
  in romania , the same is true with regards to the roma . 
  obviously , just like with the blacks in the usa , the shittier the school , the more likely you are to find blacks/gypsies . 
   they live outside the cities this is bad generalization . 
  they might be ghetoized at times , but in many instances they live inside the city . 
  where exactly to romania ? 
   we could either ask about european parties this would be the best and cleanest way to go, 
   prejudice against gypsies is a good thing . 
  anyone who met them , will agree with me . 
  i met them and i do n't agree with you . 
   i have n't got a direct example well , some of the coments in threads like : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11qo1q/brexit_europe_loses_patience_with_london/, 
  not chauvinistic , but a bit french-centric . 
  you 're notorious for trying to frenchify any english loanword and your relationship with the us has n't been that great lately . 
  so people assume a kind of nostalgia and pride for past greatness , given how important french culture used to be ( it still is , but not nearly as big as before ) . 
  the pro-gypsy or the anti-gypsy one ? 
  yeah , i was surprised by that as well, 
   we tend not to be religious depends on the country . 
   i found it odd that in a country filled with christians ( 78 percent according to ` the pew forum ' ) , 62 % disagreed with that in the us . 
  the idea of the self-made man is huge in the us ( `` pull yourself up by your bootstraps '' and all that ) . 
  i do n't think divine power is viewed there as you try to suggest ( as something you surrender to , as life is totally at the whims of your maker ) . 
  that sounds more like orthodox eastern-european fatalism . 
  depends on your definition of race . 
  i think most europeans would view them as a different race on the count that they are not european but south asian ( desi ) , but one could argue that they are caucasian ( aka white ) , so technically not a different race, 
   it 's nobody 's fault but their own yeah . 
  systemic discrimination is a fantasy and if it exists it never hurt anybody ... right ? 
   never integrate bullshit . 
  a lot of those who integrate just renounce their roots , call themselves anything but gypsies , due to the social stigma associated with the entire ethnicity . 
  plus add a bit of selective memory ( the ones with a shitty attitude do n't stand out ) and you have a nice little strawman of an argument . 
  i think they do realize . 
  then they can point towards the gypsies and say : \u201e told you they were dangerous/antisocial/whatever '' ... 
  romania too , no problem . 
  the south caucasus countries of georgia , armenia and azerbaidjan are sometimes considered culturally european . 
  the first two especially . 
  no , it makes it south-eastern european . 
  or balkan country . 
  just like cyprus , which is 100 % in asia . 
   an important thing which this article does n't mention is that the jobbik party accuses the leaders of the roma community , not the romas themselves , for the situation . 
  specifically , the leaders are putting all the aid money in their own pockets , while their followers can only complain about continuing to live in poverty . 
  corruption among the roma leaders ? 
  well i never ... another example of how some roma leaders are screwing their own people : romania has special positions reserved for roma in colleges . 
  a form of positive discrimination to make up for the educational deficit in the roma community . 
  what do the roma leaders ( the account was concerning some college in ia\u0219i or suceava ) do ? 
  they sell those positions to the highest bidding non-roma . 
   and if not then the second scenario would be to transfer the strip of land dividing flanders and wallonia to wallonia so that brussels has land connection to french speaking wallonia yeah , good luck with that . 
  the flemish will never accept it, 
   when i arrive i find the house an empty shell . 
  a construction company has ripped off its exquisite multi-sided balcony .
