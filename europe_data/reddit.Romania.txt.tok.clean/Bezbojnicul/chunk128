  thanks btw for the effort of translating this article . 
  it is indeed , interesting . 
  actually , north korea and south korea do want to merge , and consider unification as both natural and desirable . 
  making an analogy between flanders/netherlands and north korea/south korea is just plain wrong , as the problems ( based on this thread 's content ) are totally different . 
  north korea and south korea are divided by the fact that they share different political systems . 
  they do however feel that they need to be united not only on the basis of a shared language , but on the basis of a shared nation and a shared national history . 
  they see the current state of affairs as a temporary situation , based on external factors ( imperial powerplay during the cold war ) . 
  on the other hand , waht i get from this thread is that there are two distinct national identities in flanders and the netherlands , and therefore no willingness to unite and work out differences as the shared language is not enough . 
  and politically , flanders and holland are both democracies . 
   like someone did take care throughout last 50k years of human history . 
  through the 50k of human history human population , human demand for fish , human capacity to fish were never at the levels they are now . 
   do fish went extinct ? 
  yes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_walleye  the blue walleye ( sander vitreus glaucus ) , also called the blue pike , was a subspecies of the walleye that went extinct in the great lakes in the 1980s . 
  until the middle of the 20th century , it was a commercially valuable fish , with about a half million tonnes being landed during the period from about 1880 to the late 1950s , when the populations collapsed .

   ( what would happen to brussels , etc. ? ), 
  it would , of course , be a european capital city state , 
  also [ lesser romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_principalities ) ( or , as it was officially known \u201e the united principalities of moldavia and wallachia '' ), 
  well , when the [ romanian old kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regat ) united with [ transylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania#union_with_romania ) ( in 1918 ) one could say the differences between the two provinces were at least as big as those between flanders and the netherlands . 
  transylvania was in the central european ( hungarian , austrian ) cultural sphere for 900 years and that shaped everything . 
  on the other hand [ moldavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia ) and [ wallachia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallachia ) were influenced by the ottoman ( balkan ) cultural sphere . 
  ( things have evened out since then , but still one can feel the differences ) on the other hand , the [ unionist sentiment now between romania and moldova ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_romania_and_moldova ) are n't that strong . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that cultural differences are usually overlooked , or downplayed , when there is strong unionist sentiment ( be it for pragmatic or nationalistic reasons ) . 
  but from what i heard , the flemish do n't really want union with the dutch . 
   national pride . 
  belgians are n't very nationalistic . 
  the dutch overwhelmingly are . 
  given how well the flemish nationalist parties are doing , and how the language issue in flanders is so hot , people would have assumed differently , at least for the flemish .

   more people speak spanish in catalonia than catalonian ( 46 % vs 37 % ) . 
  that did n't stop irish nationalists . 
  just sayin ', 
  what do you mean ? 
  first off , thank you for the answer . 
  i 'd argue that even the melting pot model was n't that straight forward . 
  german-american immigrants were actually forced by circumstance to so thoroughly melt into the mainstream american population only because of the 2 world wars . 
  before that they were pretty distinct . 
  also there are minorities in america that are anything but assimilated . 
  the amish , ultra-orthodox jews . 
  anyway , this begs the question * what exactly does an immigrant have to leave behind and what he can keep ( and why ) * . 
  renouncing some parts of one 's identity is not a trivial thing , so one must have a good reason to do so . 
  as far as i 'm concerned names are the least of the problem ( since you mentioned it ) . 
  and by extention , we have to define * what kind of nation are we building that can include immigrants * . 
  we can agree that the old european style nation is hardly fit to make the transition from a monoracial to a multiratial type nation ( with the exception of maybe france and the uk ) . 
  i 'd say the shift of focus from ethnicity to culture is the main attempt to redefine european identity , but this process carries a lot of anxiety for the \u201e old european '' . 
  and since you brought up national minorities , even there the process is not that simple . 
  actually not everybody agrees that national minorities have the right to keep their old culture in total . 
  there was an is still a lot of majority-minority discussion and negotiation . 
  i 've hear it argued that countries such as canada are more selective with immigration , witch does n't need a more forceful assimilation being imposed . 
  would you know anything about this ? 
   i have the idea , by the way , that both your comment and the one i responded to above , are ` leading questions ' ( i.e. , meant to manoeuver me into a position where we do n't argue as equals , but you ask and i am supposed to ` defend ' my ideas ) . 
  it was not a leading question , and i was just curious about what exactly you meant . 
  not all conversations here are arguments , where i refute what you said . 
  i do n't want to argue with you , as i do n't have a clearly defined position on the issue of multiculturalism , but i am interested on what \u201e treating cultures equally '' means more exactly . 
  and even if i want to argue with you , i would like to have a more clear picture of what you stand for . 
  i would n't want to argue against a position you do not hold . 
   i prefer to have you state outright which part of my explanation you [ ... ] questions about . 
  was n't i doing that ? 
   many find it repulsive and morally wrong that the chinese eat dog many of them chinese actually . 
  western taboo about eating dog has already been taken up by some chinese . 
   see these articles : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nativism_ ( politics ) #nativism _ in_the_united_states http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/know_nothing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_american#world_wars http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-catholicism_in_the_united_states  so what parts of american culture have been changed and how ? 
  for one america stopped defining itself as anglo-saxon protestant and now defines itself as judeo-christian ( thanks also to the jews ) . 
  it might not seem as much but redefining a country 's identity like that is no small thing . 
  catholics ( subject to the whims of the pope ) and jews were seen as anathema to what a healthy protestant america should be . 
  see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_american#culture http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_americans#culture http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_american#contributions_to_american_culture_and_sport also , i 'm sure / r/askhistorians might be able to give more detail as to how american culture was in the late 18th century as opposed to how it is now , and how immigrants changed that . 
   because you notice the differences more than the things you have in common i see where you 're coming from , but it 's exactly those differences that give rise to friction , especially when they become subject of politics , as they invariably do . 
  the problem is that when two groups share a * polis * they have to change parts of their culture to move towards a common ground and a modus vivendi that is acceptable to all , without renouncing core cultural values . 
  now you raise the issue of cultures being treated equally . 
  the question is by who ? 
  the state where these cultures interact ? 
  the host population ? 
  the immigrant population ? 
  as all humans are prone to judge other cultures through cultural gogles , how can one expect anybody to treat cultures objectively ? 
  see irish , german and italian immigrants to the us . 
  first they were seen as foreign to the american nation , linguistically , culturally , religiously , you name it . 
  now they are the 3 most reported ancestries among americans and italian-american , german-american and irish-american culture is seen as core parts of american culture as a whole . 
   the distinction is about altering the new vs. altering the whole . 
  i think that both get altered , especially after the new becomes part of the whole  as for culture - you can find many definitions of it !, 
  i 'm curios about how those who oppose it tend to define it . 
   it generally encompasses the prevailing : language ; art ; food and drink ; attitudes ; social rituals ; and philosophies . 
  but i 'm guessing people have no problem with foreign \u201e art ; food and drink ; '' and the most they tend to focus on is \u201e social rituals '' and \u201e philosophies '' . 
  and even so it 's about certain social rituals and philosophies . 
  so i am a little intrigued by why people tend to focus on the umbrella term of \u201e culture '' . 
   but it 's really the only way to make sure everybody 's cultures are treated as equal . 
  what does that mean ? 
  ok . now i need a definition for \u201e culture '' . 
  i keep hearing the word tossed around , but everyone just assumes everyone else knows what it means . 
  i do n't feel your 2 definitions are mutually excluseive btw . 
   is it possible to talk negatively about multiculturalism here without getting labeled as racist troll bigot ? 
  yes . 
  but you need to define what multiculturalism actually is .
