   in three different european countries i 'm curios which european countries, 
  that 's sad :(, 
  this is the reason i dislike bot \u201e islamophobia '' and \u201e euroskepticism '' as words . 
  they can mean anything between valid criticism and irrational repulsion . 
   someone claiming that our negative reactions were unjustified and hinting that the anti-islam posts were orchestrated is stupid . 
  / r/europe went downhill way faster than the usual rate at which a subreddit goes downhill . 
  this place turned extremely fast from a civilized debating forum into place where more than half the comment are hasty generalizations full of hate . 
   heck , people killed and kill in the name of that fucking religion all over the world and it 's unfortunate but if you even dare to criticize that religion , you 're suddenly part of a conspiracy and belong to an extremist hate-group ? 
  you 're missing the point . 
  there is a difference between being critical of islam and outright hating all muslims + believing that there is a muslim conspiracy to fuck up europe . 
  there was criticism of islam before this place got kkk 'd , it just had a more civil tone . 
  i think that the entire zeitgeist is now very culture-oriented , that 's why xenophobia now is cultural more than racial ( biological ) . 
  even nationalism is on its way out , so tribal instincts are turned towards larger groups . 
  the cultures ( western , european , islamic , whatever ) . 
  i 'm not excluding racism , but i see a lot of hate now bypass race . 
  also cultural xenophobia is a lot more defensible now intelectually , while racism is not . 
  so the tribal us-vs-them kind of people vent their anger at the more acceptable targets : members of * other * cultures . 
  i do n't think anybody here thinks those reactions were anything but butthurt idiotic . 
  til . 
  thanks, 
   big cities could indeed turn above 50 % muslim . 
  yeah , god forbid a city changes it 's ethnic composition . 
  i heard bratislava went to shit since germans are no longer a majority . 
  i love how this thread turned into an example of the problem op was talking about . 
  also , i love how a group of intolerant idiots invade a subbreddit , then complain about muslims invading europe like they 're somehow better than the intolerant idiots from far-away-istan . 
  yes , i agree , the discussion is suffering . 
  this place used to be more normal . 
  also please stop reducing this to racism . 
  it 's xenophobia and [ nativism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nativism_\\ ( politics \\ ) #nativism _ in_the_united_states ) ( not unlike in the us in the past ) and not the 19th century genetic racism , aryan versus semite shit that gave us the holocaust and the likes . 
  the times have changed and hate has changed as well . 
   it 's essentially a whistle word . 
  is n't it \u201e weasel word '' ? 
   is black . 
  coloured . 
  as olddoc is talking about south-african race distinctions , you should note that there is a difference between \u201e coloured '' and \u201e black '', 
  [ interesting link ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/population_density_effects_on_living_conditions ) a redditor over at [ / r/mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/111kv5/population_density_of_europe_20102011_2480x1748/ ) found after googling about this map . 
  also a cool map : [ degree of europeon urbanisation ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/9/96/degree_of_urbanisation%2c_2001.png ), 
  i think it might go back to at least the 19th century ( the heyday of nationalism and all ) . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i never really heard it being used , but i 'm not particularilly surprised . 
   hungarians use ` romanian ' in a similar way , although only people of the lower class ... never seen educated people using it . 
  what 's the exact word used and in what context ? 
  ( i speak hungarian ), 
  ill leave this here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_profanity, 
  bring out the vodka my friend !, 
   * hutsi * and tutsi hutu, 
  actually , romania had two periods . 
  from 1950 to 1965 , the internationalist period , under gheorghiu-dej , when communism was quite anti-nationalist . 
  from 1965 to 1989 , the national-communist period , under ceau\u0219escu , when nationalism was mixed in again with communism . 
  by 1965 , enough time had passed from ww2 so that nationalism was seen as usable . 
  also , i do n't think that nationalism was seen as antifascist in ww2 here . 
  but i might not fully understand what you are trying to say . 
  could you expand a bit on your point ? 
  other soviet block countries had similar policies and the results varied . 
  romania and poland emerged as quite religious despite all the efforts to the contrary . 
  czechia and albania , not so much . 
  i thing the underlying society is important too . 
  the czechs and albanians were n't that religious to begin with so this just sped up the process . 
  just saying . 
  not untill both are in the eu , i suspect . 
  a lot of cool old flags are associated wit far right groups nowadays . 
  the dutch [ princevlag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/prinsenvlag.svg/500px-prinsenvlag.svg.png ) , the german [ empire flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/flag_of_the_german_empire.svg/500px-flag_of_the_german_empire.svg.png ) , and some others i do n't remember right now , but know seing on / r/vexillology, 
  ** romania ** - from what i remember from school : red - blood of ancestors ( and bravery and so forth ) yellow - wheat ( and by extention fertility of the land ) blue - the blue sky and the danubea and the sea . 
  or one of them at least . 
  also , the [ flag was originally horizontal ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/flag_of_the_united_principalities_of_romania_%281862_-_1866%29.svg/500px-flag_of_the_united_principalities_of_romania_%281862_-_1866%29.svg.png ) , but it got changed , probably because of french influence ( we used to love the french like crazy ) . 
   i also seem to remember someone mentioning that france 's flag is just the dutch flag rotated by 90 degrees , because during the french revolution the dutch represented freedom . 
  i remember the dutch switching from the [ orange-white-blue ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princevlag ) to the red-white-blue because of french influence , not the other way around . 
  the [ flag of france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_france ) itself is derived from the [ flag of paris ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/flag_of_paris.svg/480px-flag_of_paris.svg.png )  but where does the + in the swiss flag come from , or why do all scandianian countries have that + -- in their flags ? 
  christianity was big back in the day , so i 'm guessing that . 
  also , the scandinavian flags are probably all inspired by the [ danebrog ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_denmark ), 
  i was referencing this : http://i.imgur.com/ctbut.jpg from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/u8qmh/i_made_a_european_version_of_those_american_pride/c4t9wh8 ) . 
  i 'm a fan of the owl version myself, 
   i 'm a dane currently living in the uk , and the number of subtle accent differences that native english speakers have is immense . 
  are they posh ? 
  are they lower-class ? 
  are they from the north ? 
  manchester ? 
  liverpool ? 
  are they from essex ? 
  are they australian , american , south african , canadian ? 
  reminds me of this little article : http://www.jordipujol.cat/files/articles/times56.pdf , 
   but that 's a non sequitur . 
  it 's more of a tu quoque, 
  you do n't understand . 
  all french are the same . 
  just like all roma are the same and all muslims are the same ... 
   which iirc means something like wanderer . 
  \u201e untouchable '' . 
  see my coment below, 
  ** tsigan ** - the name originates with byzantine greek \u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( atsinganoi , latin adsincani ) or \u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( athinganoi , literally `` untouchables '' ) , a term applied to the sect of the melchisedechians . 
  ** gypsy ** - the english term gypsy originates from the middle english gypcian , short for egipcien . 
  it is ultimately derived from the greek \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( aigyptioi ) , via middle french and latin . 
  it was once believed that the romanies , or some other gypsy groups ( such as the balkan egyptians ) , originated in egypt , and in one narrative were exiled as punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant jesus . 
   what do you consider legal ? 
  legal in the framework of the spanish state . 
   i 'm not sure if international law has any general rules for the case when a bunch of people , the majority of the population in an area agrees that they wan na live in an independent or autonomous state . 
  i think it does have , given how much the phrase \u201e international law '' was tossed around in the context of kosovo 's secession . 
  ianal though  or , how would romania react if hungarians in transylvania unilaterally declared autonomy ? 
  well some did i think . 
  there was a brief uproar among the politicians and that was it .
