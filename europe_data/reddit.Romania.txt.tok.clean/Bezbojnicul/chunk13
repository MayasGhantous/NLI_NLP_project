   i wish . 
  i 'm an architect , but i do these kinds of visualization as a hobby . 
  ( [ see also ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/294soy/visualizations_of_party_reshuffling_in_the_ep/ ) ), 
  in romania , never . 
  fixed . 
  also added a chart . 
  thanks . 
  now i pimped it up even more . 
   pula is ` dick ' in romanian , right ? 
  yes  if you see people taking photos with the city name sign , chances are they are romanian tourists . 
  now color-coded for better visibility , plus some additional stuff : http://i.imgur.com/wxdexz2.png * ( now with chart !!, 
  the stereotypes will just shift from `` working little '' to `` working unproductively '' . 
  found this : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/hemicycle.html  ** how are the seats allocated ? 
  **  the rules which determine the allocation of seats in each chamber are laid down by the conference of presidents :  * members of the european parliament form groups based on their political affinity , not on their nationality . 
   * the chairs of the political groups sit in the first row in the semi-circle opposite the president of the european parliament . 
   * the third row is occupied by bureau members ( vice-presidents and quaestors ) . 
   * within the political groups , the remaining seats are generally allocated in alphabetical order . 
  they also have the layouts in pdf format ( [ strasbourg img ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xhmaag8.png ) ) , and it looks * group-based * . 
   word for word it says `` at the devil 's mother '' same in romania : `` la mama dracului '' or `` la mama naibii '', 
  * pizdeea * where i live . 
  also , * pulistan * . 
  thank you , 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  * * pocioveli\u015fte * is used in bihor county , in addition to the ones you mentioned . 
  source of data : [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_election_2014#results ) ( the inaugural session is tomorrow , and the groups are pretty much formed by today ) + the wikipages for each ep election made in inkscape ( with nicecharts for image 2 ), 
   the desired results . 
  the desired results might have been on the home-front at the expense of the continental front though . 
  since stereotypes , basically . 
  until someone looses an isle, 
   except perhaps a flight from bucharest ( romania ) to budapest ( hungary ) so basically , skipping romania ... ps . 
  try / r/askeurope as well, 
  when issuing warnings such as these , i think it would be better if you explained why he should n't take the train . 
  perfect . 
  they only needed one more party to form the group . 
  could n't they get the bulgarian vmro on board ? 
  first of all : i recommend you also try posting to / r/askeurope   my primary concerns are flying , particularly how to book such a trip when my schedule is so wide open ? 
  i do n't want to be tied to a specific airport on a set date/time . 
  is it best to book a roundtrip flight from us to norway over a large period , such as 45 days ( friend/host can accommodate travel back to airport for return flight ) then book smaller trips from norway to elsewhere ? 
  yes . 
  within europe look for low-cost flight . 
  do n't overthink stuff and panic . 
  a good place to start is by looking at low-cost airlines and what the prices are on specific dates . 
  you know what countries you want to see , and now you can get some specific dates . 
  very useful link : http://www.whichairline.com/  as far as when i 'm in europe , i 'm also comfortable with staying in hotels , using airbnb , backpacking , cycling/touring , and so on . 
  very useful for finding hostels : www.hostelworld.com / also check out [ wikitravel ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/europe ) for suggestions . 
  relax . 
  everything will be ok . , 
   i do n't know where else to post this question . 
  try / r/askeurope, 
   but at the moment , the only moderator that 's active and actually dedicated to just one subreddit is / u/bezbojnicul , and this subreddit is too big for just him to be able to keep track of the problem users that consistently break rules , or to jump on these threads and warn people about the shit they spout before they say it . 
  thanks for the appreciation , but there are other moderators that are just as active as myself ( albeit less visibly ) in weeding out hateful speech . 
  we do realize that the sub has grown and so has the racism ( unfortunately ) around here and we are preparing some changes to deal with this that will be announced soon . 
  better quality : http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/italy-migrants-refugees-asylum-seekers-1.jpg, 
   the epp ( center-right , pro-europe ) got the most meps ( 275 out of 751 ) . 
  221 actually , by [ the latest count ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_election_2014 ) . 
  275 was probably their score in 2009 . 
  in romania too . 
  even if other flags are not present , the national flag is accompanied by the eu flag 99 % of the time . 
  yeah , same feeling here .

  an interesting comment over on / r/unitedkingdom :  http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28pjih/nigerian_family_gives_up_new_home_in_belfast/cid8ocw, 
  no stress . 
  last time this was posted : * [ 448 comment thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1e6g59/young_adults_still_living_with_their_parents_in/ ), 
  he 's been doing that a bit now . 
  see : \u201e reform '', 
   hungarian is more like this : * yurt.jpg * or [ this ] ( http://www.oradeainimagini.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/palatul-vulturul-negru-detaliu.jpg ) . 
  so keep the * hurr-durr hungarians = mongols vs. romanians = gypsies * bullshit in [ / r/polandball ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/seventhworldproblems/ ), 
  it 's available in romania as well , under the name [ dots ] ( http://www.strategic.ro/wp-content/uploads/dots-23.jpg ), 
  well , he 's not wrong though architecturally speaking , just douchey . 
  [ we still do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awhlec9jfka ), 
   i 'm sure you can find links to those debates around here somewhere . 
  here is [ the thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25gogo/meta_index_of_eu_candidate_debates/ ) with links . 
  not all of eastern europe can be called central europe though ... 
   in the spanish civil war , foreign volunteers were likely not to be extremists , i 'm sure there were left-wing fanatics in the foreign volunteers , just as there were right wing fanatics ( for example [ mo\u021ba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_mo%c8%9ba ) and [ marin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasile_marin ) ) , as well as non-fanatics . 
   and they likely considered themselves french , or british or whatever . 
  people leaving to fight a jihad in syria are certainly not the very integrated bunch ... 
  the point is that these are people who go fight in a foreign war because of strong ideological convictions ( and for many , communism was a dangerous ideology back then ) . 
  whether they are/were integrated is beside the point imo . 
   i guess there is jobbik too . 
  given how much marine tried to clean up the fn 's image , getting in bed with the anti-semites would n't fly too well ... 
  did you by any chance get the impression that i have a positive attitude about them ? 
   what are they , one country short ? 
  pressure on marine , but surely there must be enough non inscrits still floating around ? 
  well , [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_election_2014#results ) , there 's still golden dawn , the german nazis and the bulgarian nationalist vmro party to choose fro . 
   what does / r/europe think of european citizens who go to fight in syria ? 
  i think they are no different from the volunteers who went fighting in the spanish civil war ( irrespective of which side they fought for ) . 
   what , if anything , do you think should be done about this phenomenon ? 
  good question . 
  i 'm not sure i cold give a good enough answer . 
   is there room within the framework of liberal democracy for public programs to deter people joining jihad groups ? 
  of course there is , why would n't there be ? 
  we fight poverty , social exclusion , extremism and so on on a daily basis in our liberal democracy , do n't we ? 
   would preventative police surveillance be acceptable on the sole basis of their former jihadi status ? 
  yes , although i do think it should n't go on indefinitely . 
  but i guess if you are harmless for 10 years ( for example ) , the local inteligence agency moves on to other folks anyway . 
  why not greens-efa ? 
  the * efa * part seems like their cup of tea . 
  i know it 's difficult , but if someone is being a xenophobe , please do n't respond with insults , but instead send us a message and we 'll remove the comment/user in question . 
  thank you . 
   we 're too different from the rest of the continent .
