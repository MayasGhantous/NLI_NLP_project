   then you 're intolerant to their views too ... intolerance of intolerance is still intolerance . 
  and if you can openly contemplate expelling him , then he should be able to openly contemplate expelling somebody else .

  [ dual citizenship has been permitted since 1973 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_nationality_law#dual_citizenship ) , so i would n't expect too many first generation immigrants to have only french citizenship . 
  the law in france , google-translated from [ french wiki ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalit%c3%a9_fran%c3%a7aise#d.c3.a9ch.c3.a9ance ) :  article 25 of the civil code states that revocation [ of citizenship ] is possible if the person has acquired french nationality by naturalization , and if it `` is convicted of an indictable offense or crime infringing the fundamental interests of the nation or a crime or offense constituting an act of terrorism `` or '' if it comes to the benefit of a foreign state for acts incompatible with the status of french and prejudicial to the interests of france . '', 
   it is a procedure that is used marginally in exceptional situations : from the department of immigration , we identified only five cases of revocation of french nationality in 2006 and none since . 
  the number of persons who have been deprived of french nationality was 14 on 9-year period from 1989 to 1998 , 7 of the 9-year period from 1998 to 2007 . 
  i think / r/europe should expel people like this . 
  their culture of intolerance is not what europe is about . 
   unless you suggest that the neural network of an immigrant from there gets magically reformed to leave those ideas behind by the act of crossing the border , i dont see your point . 
  yeah , because they remain carbon copies of their societies of origin . 
   source : http://dvmx.com/british_muslim_youth.pdf you should take note of the fact that the youth are more radical than the older generation . 
  given that the older generation is closer culturally to the country of origin , maybe you should search for the reasons the youth are more radical in the current setup of host-country / minority dinamics than their culture of origin . 
  plus the fact that immigrant communities are not mirror images of their home countries . 
  they do start assimilating , so i 'm fairly sure they are more liberal than the place of origin . 
  turks immigrated to german-speaking countries . 
  muslims of france are from the maghreb ( algeria , tunisia ) and black africa,

  yeah , tell me about it ... 
  you should talk to some old people in eastern europe .

  i tried to answer [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/10gwhs/are_romanians_descendede_from_local_latinized/ ) . 
  ( linking so as others can follow the discussion ), 
   \u00fei\u00f0 get those devil letters away from me !!, 
  google helped a bit too . 
  i found it interesting how the ep is asserting itself silently , while people are under the impression that the eu is becoming more and more undemocratic . 
   they give every basis i can think of . 
  no it does n't . 
  and i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to say with the following paragraph . 
  it 's poetic and all , but it really does n't mean much for the current discussion . 
   but transylvania never was a greek catholic . 
  half the romanian population of transylvania was greek-catholic ( uniate ) after 1700 . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_church_united_with_rome,_greek-catholic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_school  when there is no possible way to gather direct evidences , you simply rule out all the available false options how can you rule something out when you do n't have evidence . 
  remember , absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . 
   there was an interesting pool in 1699 when the romanian church united , and they asked the people about what basis they had when they made their choice and it turned out that they did n't have much idea about christianity at all ( let alone the east-west schism ) i 'd like to see that pole . 
  link ? 
  ( does n't matter if it 's a hungarian link )  transylvania which was mostly western catholic since the beginning , just like the rest of the hungarian kingdom or the austro-hungarian empire . 
  it might have had a roman catholic majority up untill the protestant reformation , but i doubt it . 
  i 'm not sure how reliable medieval censuses are . 
   we have dig sites of graves and ruins from different ethnics from different times . 
  history can track the agathyrsi , the avars , the clets and the thracians , etc , but there is no evidence of anything romance related from those times . 
  you have no way of knowing the language of those interred in those graves . 
  think about it this way : when the magyars changed their culture from nomadic pagans to sedentary christians , they did not loose their language . 
   it 's true that there are a few sites of some `` latin settlements north of the danube after the evacuation of 271 '' , but we do n't know who really lived there and the linking of those to romanian groups arriving in the 12th century is still inconclusive . 
  so we do have evidence . 
   it looks like that it was really a no-mans-land with negligible tribal or vandal activity for a long time , and whoever lived in those few settlements were `` gone '' for the later times it does n't look that way . 
  but a terra nullius narrative always favors the latest conquerors . 
   you do n't `` latinize '' an entire ( ! ), 
  ethnic group in less than two hundred years , that 's simply not possible . 
  nobody claims that all the dacians were latinized in 200 years . 
  the claim is that it was sufficiently latinised ( including through imigration ) in order for that the latin linguistic element to become dominant , and in the subsequent period to assimilate the rest . 
   ( and -- btw - even the wiki you linked is still an argument ) . 
  yes , an argument where there is various evidence presented in favour of continuity and against the imigration theory , including archeological evidence . 
  evidence which you did not address . 
   i was wondering if there is any recent genetic study out there to back up the daco-roman theory . 
  genetics do n't help one way or another . 
  romanians are similar to other populations from around the area . 
  see : http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/306-the-genetic-map-of-europe and http://www.tdaxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/genmapeuropea2-479x281.jpg and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/haplogroups_europe.png  for example , the szekelys found to have significant amount of asian genetic traits ( p-m45 ( xm173 ) ) which you ca n't find in any other european ethnic group . 
  this is very interesting . 
  although i do n't think you gave the right link . 
  this is what i found : http://www2.sci.u-szeged.hu/fokozatok/pdf/kovacsne_csanyi_bernadett/tezisfuzet_angol_csanyib.pdf ( although some parts of the methodology may be targets for criticism , like selecting all the szekely samples from one village ) ps . 
  no need to apollogise . 
  i prefer late answer to no answer ( and it was n't late tbh . 
  this is not instant messaging ) . 
  also your english is fine . 
  i remember most of the bullying happening in middle schoole ( grades 5-8 ) . 
  by highschool everybody would have mostly chilled the fuck out . 
   it does n't surprise me the hungarians want to claim it . 
  not only that , it also has a lot of significance for them historically . 
  kinda like their kosovo . 
   i 'm trying to say that `` sometimes '' and `` centuries '' are entirely different things , and they give entirely different basis in an argument about claiming rights in a justifiable and in a moral way . 
  the hungarian kingdom built insane amount of fortresses , and military outposts in transylvania to defend the homeland ( and europe ) against the eastern empires , and they fought there for centuries . 
  they give no basis whatsoever . 
  who fought for what piece of land , or who built the most where are not arguments for claiming rights . 
  demographics are . 
   they were forced to learn latin ( or german and hungarian later ) to be able to get higher education or to `` accomplish more '' and they were also forced to convert to some western christian denomination to be able to have a say in politics . 
  but that meant assimilation of the converted one , so they still had no say . 
  there 's a reason the national movement in 19th c. transylvania developed around the greek-catholic romanians , not the orthodox ones . 
   i understand , but there are no evidences about a romance present in the territory in question , while we do have a lot of archeological evidences about avars , celts and from all the other groups in that time period . 
  so how does one differentiate latin-speakers from avar-speakers in archeological digs . 
  also , how far do celtic traces extend ? 
  afaik they were n't relevant to the area by the time the romans left dacia . 
   i do n't know about any creditable archaeological , genetic or about any other non-biased evidences available whatsoever . 
  wiki mentions some archeological digs : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daco-romanian_continuity#arguments_for i do n't know what you mean by the genetic ones also , am i correct in assuming you are hungarian ? 
  also , i 've submitted a question to / r/askhistorians : http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/10gwhs/are_romanians_descendede_from_local_latinized/, 
   the claims of the daco-roman theory ( which was never proven ( nor accepted ) by any international history organization except the romanians ) citation ? 
  also , are you a historian ? 
  i think i 'll submit this topic to / r/askhistorians , to get some more ( non-central european ) feedback . 
   there was no claim for that territory from any entity , country or empire whatsoever , nor was there any force to defend the land against the arriving hungarians . 
  this is beside the point . 
  the romanians argue for a continuous romance population there , not a romanian state of any kind . 
  there could very well have been total anarchy .
