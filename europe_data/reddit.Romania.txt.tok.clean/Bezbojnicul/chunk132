  also , the ideea that if you only have one citizenship your is loyalty towards that country is ridiculous to be honest . 
  ( i find the ideea of `` loyalty to one country '' is a bit too nationalistic for my tastes ) you can very well have only german citizenship and want to utterly destroy that country . 
  you do n't even need to be a jihadist . 
  you can very well be a german anarho-terrorist , or whatnot . 
   germany requires them to give up their turkish citizenship , that 's stupid and counterproductive, 
  wiki : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kanun, 
  not really , if they do not become automatic members of the eu and the eurozone . 
  also , i do n't think scotland or catalonia are comparable with greece . 
  agreed in principle . 
  but the question arises , after how many decades do we accept the new democraphic situation as the status-quo and treat it as such . 
  let 's say that after 70 years , all the turks in northern cyprus are born there , irespective of the fact that most of their grandfathers are settlers . 
  so they are basically cypriots , and feel attachment to no other place than the \u201e republic of northern cyprus '' . 
  what then ? 
   new countries that will immediately be in the deficit . 
  what do you mean by \u201e being in deficit '' ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=469133303108322&amp;set=a.251051781583143.59756.204904669531188&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1 ), 
  so what if those become independent ? 
  catalonia might very well become independent . 
  people favoring independence in catalonia has exceeded 50 % according to a recent poll . 
  we 're quite pro-american ( and by extension , pro-israel ) since communism fell , but there is no blind love towards israel . 
  we 're friends because that is the proper thing to do between gentlemen , while the arabs seem a bit coarse . 
  on the other hand , there are historic ties with the arab states . 
  afaik , during the cold war , romania had a much more ballanced attitude than the warsaw pact states ( which were more pro-arab ) . 
  we were friends with both . 
  also , a lot of arab leaders were left-leaning ( assad , saddam , arafat , ghaddafi , etc ) , plus we were a francophone nation , so it 's no surprise we had good relationship with the sirians and the palestinians . 
  a lot of them intermarried with the local women , and stayed . 
  one of the most loved people in romania is [ raed arafat ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1409981-raed-arafat-reluctant-rebel ) . 
  but aside all this , i 'm sure the commie secret service was good friends with its arab counterparts . 
  so it would not be difficult to revitalize romanian-arab relations . 
  actually , ignoring these relations was pretty stupid . 
  i seem to remember redeaing about the fact that we could have been big players in libya in the 90s had the newly democratic powers in romania not decided to go full speed towards the west , and ignore all the rest of the world . 
   we will have to be pro-israel since romania and greece like israel actually , romania has had good ties with both israel and the arab world . 
  the arab links might have shrunk since 1989 , but there are links that can be revived . 
  so is todays islam . 
  under all the theology there are social and economic grievances . 
  you ca n't have fundamentalism without frustrated muslims . 
  they did now : http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-bangladesh-usa-idusbre88d0ir20120914, 
  oh , i do n't feel bad , do n't worry . 
  i never said it 's representative . 
  i said it was '' * in romania * '' . 
  or , if you 're ancestors were hungarian citizens and you speak the language you can get it for free * * - or virtually free . 
  there might be some small taxes involved, 
   more like the greek student ** s ** . 
  yeah , but stories usually revolve around one guy : `` there were quite a few greek students at my college . 
  i remember spiros , who was in our circle of friends . 
  he was quite a character . '', 
  [ then details about the fun things spiros used to do : party hard , swear a lot , whatever ], 
  amateurs ... you want `` ugly '' ? 
  this is ugly : [ tourist bashing in romania ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/foreign-bikers-attacked-with-stones-by-roma-in-romanian-village/65083/ ), 
   in the last decades , especially between 1980 and 1990 , many greek people have chosen foreign universities , but the popularity of romania and bulgaria is on the rise . 
  most people who were students in the '70s and '80s have one or two stories about `` the greek student '' , as they were cool people , swore a lot and partied hard . 
  also back in the '80s , having a greek student meant easier access to contraband such as jeans and foreign cigarettes . 
  by they might have gotten higher a bit , because of ro , bg and gr , 
  to be fair , it was n't easy for hungary to accept that transylvania is gone either . 
  the 1920-1945 period saw quite a lot of denial and iredentism . 
  serbia is still in the first phases . 
  but i agree . 
  they will get over it eventually . 
  at least i hope so . 
   relations have improved a lot , i 've met ordinary romanians at concerts etc. 
  who were very happy when they heard i 'm hungarian . 
  there was an article in the romanian press about a sociologist doing some fieldwork in bucharest 's run-down ghetto of ferentari . 
  he used to say he was from budapest when talking to taxidrivers and they would be quite friendly . 
  at first he used to say he was hungarian , and taxidrivers would think he was a transylvanian hungarian and start getting all political and stuff . 
   but yeah , people are way more relaxed nowadays , and not paranoid about `` them hungarians trying to steal transylvania '' and all that old jazz . 
  the article made it seem that this was something recent, 
  oh , i never meant to imply that it was a resounding succes ( or that it changed the ` core ' of the language ) . 
  but on the surface a quite a number of words got replaced with neo-latin equivalents . 
  and even when they did n't replace the slavic word , many times the neo-latin ones care more prestige . 
  starting with the 19th century and romantic nationalism , romanian started importing a lot of words from french and italian , in an effort to increase the latin-ness of the language . 
  romanian is a romance language surrounded mostly by slavic ones , so naturally , being `` latin '' was what set us apart , and around which the national narrative was built . 
  so we tried to de-slavicise the language . 
  therefore , the more slavic a sentence , the older it feels . 
  not exactly what you were asking for ( class distinction in french ) but more of a temporal distinction . 
  also , most words of romany ( gypsy ) origin are considered `` underclass words '' . 
  slowly http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_german#origins, 
  ever ? 
   the commission in the cvm report pays a lot of attention to the recent political developments [ in romania ] , and says it is seriously worried about the respect for fundamental principles of a well functioning , independant judicial system and respect for democratic instititutions . 
  this is why most romanians wo n't be surprised with the dutch decision . 
  your comment needs more  * / s *, 
  the korean war never ended , so america just entered an armistice . 
  vietnam they lost , and they did so painfully . 
  not to mention that vietnam was closer to people as tv coverage and whatnot started to spread . 
  there are many hungarians from romania who emigrated to hungary in the early 90 's ( my aunt for example ) or later ( again , a friend of mine ) , and like to keep in touch with folks back in romania . 
  also , some people ( including romanians ) in oradea have recently bought houses across the border , and commute daily to work ( again , i know at least one family in this situation ) , as the border is just 10km away . 
  but hungary is on ukraine 's list, 
  romanian emigration was directed mainly towards italy and spain, 
  also hungary , for romania 's hungarian minority, 
  from what i 've read , there is a nascent central government that is the process of absorbing the various militias . 
  anyway , this does not look like the doing of a militia that is part of the core rebel force , which to various degrees support the current government , though they still are reluctant to give up autonomy . 
  looks more like a fringe group . 
  not surprising given the proliferation of arms and the weak governmental security force . 
  i was n't contradicting you , as much as i was adding info to the conversation . 
  i understand what you 're trying to say . 
  ( i 'm also curious why you got downvoted ) http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/12/the_tragic_optimism_of_an_american_diplomat?page=0,1  to state the obvious , stevens was killed not by `` libya '' but by a handful of people in a crowd of several hundred . 
  it 's unclear whether , as administration officials have reportedly begun to conclude , the violence was premeditated , or whether it was an opportunistic response to the gathering of an angry crowd , but a consensus has begun to form that the attack was carried out by ansar al-sharia , a militant group . 
   so what does `` libya '' think ? 
  as my colleague marc lynch has noted , both libya 's leaders and libyans taking to social media have condemned the attack unequivocally , and have spoken of their high regard for stevens . 
  willliam lawrence , north africa director for the international crisis group , who is now in tripoli , says that even salafist groups have vocally condemned the killing , and ansar al-sharia has distanced itself from the rogue elements said to have carried out the violence , inviting libya 's militias to hunt them down and bring them to justice . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19584734  libya 's new prime minister mustafa abu shagur told the afp news agency there had been a `` big advance '' in the investigation in benghazi .
