  `` arrests have been made and more are under way as we speak , '' he said . 
  deputy interior minister wanis al-sharif said that police were gathering evidence and , in addition to those arrested , some militants were being closely monitored . 
  also , not all libyans should be lumped together with the wackos who killed the american diplomat : http://imgur.com/a/tlcyi  ( that 's the main reason i think a direct democracy ca n't work , sometimes we just become angry and make terrible decisions , like , storming a consulate for no real reason ) true, 
   denmark  ) try living in romania . 
  sometimes i feel like we live at the ends of the earth ... 
   you ca n't just impose a language on people without soviet union like repression . 
  so you 'll need a `` soviet union like repression '' imposed on brussels once it becomes part of free flanders , right ? 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  why would you think that ? 
  i 've always thought about this , albeit with the [ hungarian guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_garda ) or the [ hvim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-four_counties_youth_movement ) versus the [ ( romanian ) new right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noua_dreapt%c4%83 ) . 
  i would pay to see that . 
  after all , gladiatorial fights are a roman tradition , and we , as europeans should hold on to our graeco-roman heritage , 
   at this point i only trust an european organism to keep control of the rampant austerity and massive corruption in my country . 
  i 'd welcome an european federation with open arms and a bottle of champagne , if at the time i can afford one . 
  same feeling in romania ( and i bet in bulgaria too ) . 
  i would guess a form of automatic citizenship based on residence . 
  those uk citizens living in scotland ( and probably those born in scotland ) would be granted automatic scottish citizenship . 
  i would also think a form of simplified granting of citizenship to people of scottish ancestry would be set up . 
  so if you parents or grandparents were scottish , but moved to london ( or australia , or wherever ) some decades ago , they would get citizenship easier than , say , an immigrant . 
  ( some european countries have similar schemes of simplified granting of citizenship . 
  romania , hungary and greece i know for sure ), 
   i wonder if that means that the ( rest of the ) uk must reapply too . 
  i think the uk-lite will be seen as the successor state of the uk-of-now , and not as a new country , therefore all uk-eu agreements will still stand . 
  the uk will not be seen as breaking up , but only scotland will be viewed as seceding from it . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/successor_state  succession may refer to the transfer of rights , obligations , and/or property from a previously well-established prior state ( the predecessor state ) to the new one ( the successor state ) . 
  transfer of rights , obligations , and property can include overseas assets ( embassies , monetary reserves , museum artifacts ) , ** participation in treaties , membership in international organizations ** , and debts, 
  that would be option b. 
  they are working on it . 
  as it was my first time on that road , i 'm not really sure how much it improved . 
  some sections were quite ok . 
   but i doubt that 3-4 people qualify as a nation . 
  but then you have the complicated question of what is a nation . 
  i was asking more about the general mood of the catalans , not just your opinion particularly . 
  so are people fighting for an independent catalonia in the form of today 's region of catalonia , or independence for all the catalan countries ? 
  wat is the mood in valencia and the balearics ? 
  but it will take some of the steam out of it . 
  yeah , i was surprised this summer to see how many there were on road from vama veche to balchik, 
  go to new zeeland or something ... 
   former gypsies , because being a gypsy is more a matter of mentality than of race . 
  gypsy is overwhelmingly used as an exonym for the roma/romanyes , which are a population of south-asian origin . 
  so tell me how correcting a factual error makes me a defender of stoning/sharia/iran ? 
  [ a worldwide pew survey finds muslims in the balkans are markedly less rigorous in their religious practices than their counterparts elsewhere ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yijjo/a_worldwide_pew_survey_finds_muslims_in_the/ ), 
  also , it 's on the rise in africa and other parts of the world , thanks to american proselytizing ... 
   or you learn about honor crimes not all muslims commit honor crimes , and not all honor crimes are perpetrated by muslims . 
  there are quite a number of hindu honor crimes in india . 
  yes , they can overlap , but i do n't think that most people here assume hat race is a determining factor for culture . 
   well indeed not , as homosexuality is grounds for beheading iran does not execute by beheading . 
  saudi arabia does . 
   we have neo-nazis walking around propagating for a new holocaust etc. 
  yet their race/beliefs is never brought up . 
  they are just , rightfully so , seen as complete idiots . 
  true . 
  they are no more part of the so called ` western culture of tolerance ' that the jihadis . 
   would you then start going to a mosque every sunday ( ? ), 
  [ friday ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friday_mosque ), 
   the level of racism of / r/europe is just intolerable call it xenophobia . 
  it 's not ( mainly ) about race , but about culture , and racism is n't a synonym for xenophobia . 
  plus if you call it racism , they 'll pull the ` islam is not a race ' card . 
  they do . 
  and it 's wrong . 
  i 'm not saying there are no shitty gypsy or muslim communities . 
  but you ca n't judge how representative they are based solely on personal experience . 
   but i suspect they would integrate better , if we had mixed them up better with the local population rather than putting them all together in ghettoes . 
  yep ... http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/03/marseille/dickey-text, 
  [ grannies of eastern romania ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-11534058-fotografia-saptamanii-batrana-care-curata-singura-zapada-casa.htm ) are ready !, 
  latin as in roman-catholic ( western christianity ) , as opposed to orthodox countries ( eastern christianity ) , which are graeco-slavonic countries culturally, 
  but call yourself canadian ... 
   some women wear caps and sunglasses to complete the covering but in a way that appears secular or even fashionable . 
  how very french of them ... 
  attila is a common name among hungarians . 
  acces to central asia 's oil and gas is done via georgia and azerbaidjan ( when not done through russia ) . 
  if azerbaidjan becomes unstable or the regime changes , european dependence on russian gas will increase a lot . 
  now ask eastern europe how they feel about that . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbajdjan#transportation  azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials . 
  the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline ( btc ) became operational in may 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of azerbaijan , georgia and turkey . 
  the btc is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the caspian sea oilfields to global markets . 
  the south caucasus pipeline , also stretching through the territory of azerbaijan , georgia and turkey , became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the european market from the shah deniz gas field . 
  shah deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year . 
  azerbaijan also plays a major role in the eu-sponsored silk road project . 
  before anybody starts with the `` armenia and azerbaidjan is not europe '' please keep in mind that transcaucasia : a ) is sometimes included culturally in europe , as it 's mostly christian , and the muslims are quite secular b ) is relevant to european interests geopolitically and a war on europe 's fringe is bad news, 
   please , do n't just run around reddit bashing your country , you 're not the only one living in it , and it affects all of us because of ignorant people like you who only look at it from their own point of view , developed because of the mass-media focusing only on those students that failed their exam , and making them the laughing stock of a country . 
  please spare me the nationalist rhetoric . 
  the `` educational system '' is not only made up of universities , so please do n't accuse me of cherry picking , when you 're doing it yourself . 
  also , a few great students who study abroad do not make a good educational system . 
  the average level is what defines the system , not the top 1 % . 
  take for example the international pisa tests . 
  romanians have below average scores . 
  check for yourself : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pisa_test#2009  for example lets talk about mathematics and the romanians performance in mathematics , or physics , or informatics , or even trivial tests such as gmat or gre . 
  we top the lists , with having won these year gold and silver medals in all the fields listed above , at highschool level . 
  you ca n't argue that * overall * the system is good , because the top ones are spectacular . 
  that 's like arguing that there is no poverty in africa because some africans ( the politicians ) are filthy rich . 
  also , anecdotal evidence is not relevant evidence . 
  you can not analyze a system based on your biases and limited experience . 
  that is what is truly self-centered and narrow-minded . 
  meanwhile , in romania : [ article from 2011 ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5gqojrjektylacyflyyqutd-y93zw?docid=cng.8a42f67a199cf2c824119eb348348cc2.1c1 ) & [ the economist piece , 2012 ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/08/education-romania ), 
   although half the police voted for it i remember that statement being debunked round here ... 
  i have no idea . 
  [ this article from may ] ( http://croatiantimes.com/news/general_news/2012-05-11/26988/only_8_eu_nations_so_far_wont_restrict_croatian_workers_ ) says yes . 
   if possible , invest in an e-reader that is actually very high on my list . 
  i have loads of cool books on pdf and i hate reading on the computer .
