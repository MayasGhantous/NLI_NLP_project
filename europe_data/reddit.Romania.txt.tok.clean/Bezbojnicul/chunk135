  it 's a powerful reason to do anything . 
  this is very relevant to the eu as well . 
  europe is ` surrounded ' by existing and emerging superpowers ( usa , russia , china , brasil , etc ) just like switzerland was by the great powers . 
  western european countries can not have the same status they once enjoyed on the world stage without unity . 
  on the other hand , the east needs protection from russia . 
  `` hang together or hang separately , if you would . 
  it 's a powerful reason to do anything . '', 
  just as you said . 
  you should also add the western christianity/eastern orthodoxy divide , once you 're at it . 
  he was talking about food , music and especially political opinions . 
  do n't tell me there is n't a sharp political divvide between the south , and it 's now traditional pro-republican stance , and ne and cali , which are far more pro-democrat . 
  also , i never said their differences outweigh their commonalities . 
  but you have to agree that the south does have strong particularities within the us . 
  nationalism is a specific kind of tribalism , with certain characteristics . 
  please do n't conflate the two . 
  tribalism has indeed been around since forever , but nationalism is a fairly recent development . 
  as such , another form of post-nationalist tribalism will probably superceede it . 
   occiental-speaking population [ occitan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitan ), 
  the `` nation '' is not something empirical . 
  it 's an ideological construct . 
  an '' [ imagined community ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imagined_communities ) '' . 
  do not confuse the medieval term ` natio ' with the 19th century concept of nation . 
  one did not have a nation in the modern sense prior to the 19th century , when they were thought up . 
  also do n't confuse tribalism with nationalism . 
  there are other forms of collective identity , besides the `` nation '' . 
   values can not be created by [ ... ] philosophers . 
  sure they can . 
  nationalism is itself an ideological thing . 
   t should ... but first , we need to agree on some . 
  we 've already started : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism, 
   you see , the difference between say ... us and the hungarians for example is that we openly accepted german culture and still do to this day so did the hungarians . 
  it was them who colonised ( greater ) hungary with germans in the first place . 
  and a lot of germans asssimilated into hungarian society . 
  no true scotsman , ey ? 
   germans agree on more things than they disagree on , and i suppose it 's the same thing for romanians . 
  and that 's what europeans need to do as well  common values there 's a lot of talk about `` european values '' these days  ... and has widespread seperationist terrorism it 's declining , and somehow spain remained in one piece . 
   after centuries of war , peoples subduing each other and enforcing a common culture , after genocide and ethnic cleansing . 
  aversion to wars of the past is one of those common values . 
   average romanian  we do not hear the same music , or eat the same food , or even have similar political opinions , neither there are a lot of differences between transylvanian romanians and [ regat romanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regat ) too . 
  germany also has a lot of internal variability , as per the weisswurstequator . 
  also , your statement holds true in every way for the us as well . 
  the south is way different from new england , or california . 
   europeans had the chance to witness first-hand what happens to multiethnic countries switzerland is also mutietnic . 
  spain too . 
  the uk is multinational/multiethnic . 
  * edit : * italy also has internal cultural and linguistic differences, 
  romanian census of 2011 : `` atheists '' + `` no religion '' = total a staggering 0.24 % of the population . 
  and malta, 
  no , it 's an ethnic identity . 
  and their race is south asian , albeit diluted through intermixing with gadjo ( non-roma ) populations . 
  a lot of roma have strikingly similar features to pakistanis , and north-western indians , and their skin is usually darker than that of the host-populations of europe . 
  so calling atziganism ` racism ' is not far off the mark . 
  bot i do concede that it sometimes is mixed with cultural xenophobia . 
   there is not a macedonian nation you do n't get to decide that . 
  nations are about self-identification . 
  if they decide to build a national identity around being `` macedonian '' it 's not for you to decide weather they can or can not . 
  saying * \u201e others ca n't use the name macedonia because macedonia is greek and only greek '' * is doing exactly that . 
   sure they live in the much wider region of macedonia , nobody has a problem with this , but they can not claim the whole region for themselves or the culture . 
  neither can you . 
   also macedonia is a region , it 's not a country , i 'm sorry . 
  this does not make any sense . 
  moldova is both [ a region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavia ) , and [ a country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldova ) . 
  luxemburg is both [ a region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg_\\ ( belgium \\ ) ) and [ a country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg ) . 
  azerbaidjan is both [ a region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijan_\\ ( iran \\ ) ) and [ a country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijan ) . 
  bahrain is both [ a region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bahrain_\\ ( historical_region \\ ) ) and [ a country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bahrain ) . 
  `` history of religions '' would probably be more acceptable to many, 
  the leading urologist in my hometown is a zigeuner . 
   noone would complain if there would be roma engineers , doctors or workers . 
  there are . 
  you just do n't see them and they rarely make the news , the english language news even less so . 
  for example , the number one urologist in my hometown ( oradea , ro . ), 
  is a gypsy ( roma ) . 
  actually , romania 's kinda barbaric and surreal on the whole , with or without gypsies . 
  it 's in western europe where the gypsies really stick out . 
  also , some gypsies are more aggressive than others , and some regions of romania are more ` wild ' than others . 
   not even the most fucked up guy would say things like `` nuke mecca 2012 '' . 
  you really underestimate people ... 
  true . 
  especially the ones at the fringes . 
  also : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbians-lost-their-enthusiasm-over-eu-integrations  new survey shows that support for eu membership has now dropped below 50 per cent - but the percentage of those opposed to eu membership has also dropped , presenting a mixed picture overall . 
  this should be a pan-european commemoration day ... weird thing is , aug 23 used to be the national day during the comunist regime in romania, 
   young muslim men in germany are systematically trying to recruit their peers for jihad using sophisticated rhetoric and psychology and by targeting vulnerable youths who are searching for direction in life same as any far-right group, 
  regarding ( daco - ) romanian i can speak a light version of the [ cri\u0219ana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana ) dialect , but usually regional accents/dialects are looked down upon by the more educated as peasant-speak . 
  this dialect , like others from western romania it was influenced by hungarian , both phonetically and in term of vocabulary . 
  for more detail see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana_subdialect_of_romanian http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language#dialects a local hip-hop artist that sings in the dialect : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb-ioybq6u ( for romanian speakers ), 
   we can pronounce words with no nouns vowels ... 
   the one i best remember is `` paszuj '' for `` z\u00f6ldbab '' , that too  ) sometimes , when i speak hungarian , i 'm not really sure if my way of saying something is compatible with `` standard hungarian '' or i 'm just using szekely-hungarian . 
   off course , but without a mean to speak to each other we can never feel part of the same group . 
  do all the swiss speak german ? 
  i speak a watered down szekely form of hungarian , and always feel weird with some of the ways hungarians in hungary speak ( i live near the hungarian border ) . 
  the biggest difference i feel is in the way some vegetables have different names in transylvania . 
   i 've always thought it to be like `` krumpli '' and `` burgonya '' , where the former is more the more common or folkly word you want folky ? 
  try `` pityoka '', 
  probably daco-romanian of the timok kind, 
   but the junger generation , with mobile phones and the internet are often writing in swiss german , without real grammar it has grammar ( all languages have grammar ) . 
  i think you mean `` without a standardised written form '', 
  wtf is the ukraine morality commission ? 
  this ca n't be real ... 
   and according to the law , the permanent electoral authority is tasked with updating the permanent electoral lists , but they have n't . 
  the current chief of the permanent electoral authority was a member of basescu 's party you ca n't really blame basescu for this .
