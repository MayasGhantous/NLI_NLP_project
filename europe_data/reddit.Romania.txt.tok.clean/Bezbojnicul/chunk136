  not when the anti-basescu bunch formed the government . 
  and do n't even get me started on this * `` every single ` independent ' institution has been politicized to do one man 's bidding . 
   no , quorum is not part of the referendum law , it never was , maybe you are reading from bad sources . 
  yes it is . 
  http://www.becreferendum2007vu.ro/documente/legislatie/l3.pdf  * art . 
  * ( notice that this article is part of the original law , not a later amendment , as those are marked with an asterisk )  all elections are important , you ca n't say that one is less important than the other , it 's undemocratic to presume as such . 
  i 'm not saying that one is more important . 
  i 'm saying that one is an exceptional type of voting , and therefore is subject to exceptional clauses . 
   regarding the future census numbers , that 's the issue we are currently facing , the census result release has been delayed a lot as is , and if it 's released in 2-3 months , what will we all notice ? 
  that we have an illegitimate president ? 
  no , because laws do not work that way . 
  he is legitimate as long as the lists were not updated . 
  he might not be morally legitimate , but laws do not work that way . 
  you have to go through the paperwork to update the lists , if you want to base your legitimacy on the new numbers . 
   but they were heard and acted on by european people 's party members . 
  although epp members reacted more vigorously , some socialists also reacted . 
   viktor orb\u00e1n ( another epp member ) did the same with the hungarians in romania ( we have a pretty large number of hungarians here ) the hungarian minority is pretty pro-basescu , no matter what hungarian politicians urge them to vote . 
  sometimes laws supercede the the mob 's will . 
  for example , even if 8 milion people vote for the breakup of the country , their vote will count for nothing , as it contradics the constitution . 
  in this case , the vote contradicted the electoral law . 
  condition x ( quorum ) was not met , therefore the process of impeachment is not valid . 
   is it a sign of democracy working that the constitutional court , with judges appointed by the president only one third of the cc is appointed by the president , and only 2 out of the 3 ones appointed by the president were appointed by basescu , the third one was appointed by iliescu . 
  afaik 4 judges can be said to be pro-basescu , 4 pro-usl ( anti-basescu ) , and 1 pro-udmr , which might vote pro-basescu . 
   the quorum was reached not according to the papers valid at the start of the referendum . 
  you ca n't use tomorrow 's numbers for today 's referendum . 
   the constitutional court introduced the quorum requirement , even though this notion is practically unheard of in most civilized democracies , but basescu had to be helped to stay in power . 
  he said in 2007 that the `` quorum is an abuse '' . 
  how exactly was it it introduced to help him then ? 
  oh , and from what i 've read , the need for a quorum is part of the referendum law ever since its adoption in 2000 . 
   going by the quorum logic , the eu parliament should be invalidated too , because in eu member countries , eu parliament elections rarely go over 50 % +1 of the voting population . 
  the logic of the quorum is that it is needed when exceptional things have to be voted on ( like a presidential impeachment ) . 
  europarliamentary elections are not extraordinary in any way . 
  wanting to impeach a president is an extraordinary event , breaking a 5-year mandate , and the quorum is there to help ensure that impeachment is n't used too carelessly , whenever the opposition feels like it . 
   according to the permanent voter lists , which have n't been changed since 2002 the current government ( anti-basescu ) could have attempted to change them before launching the impeachment . 
  you ca n't cry foul after that . 
   but the funny thing is that there was a population census a year ago , and the preliminary numbers from that show that if the permanent lists were updated , the quorum was met , and then some . 
  then the impeachers should have waited until the new numbers become valid . 
  you can not validate a referendum today with numbers that will become official two month from now ( or whenever they become official ) . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you might have moral arguments against basescu , but according to the law - and we do strive for a law-based society , to a whim-based one - he is still president . 
  i bit the bullet when he became president again ( i did not vote for him ) , and accepted the fact that he 'll be president for 5 more years . 
  because that 's the way democracy works . 
   it 's of note that the new government attempted to change the constituion when exactly did they try to change the constitution ( which in turn needs a referendum to be valid ) . 
  do n't you mean the electoral law ? 
  ok , my mistake . 
  i was under the impression that just like styria , it was divided between austria and slovenia . 
  never said it was n't stupid, 
   it 's the original reasoning behind it depends how far back you go ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision#history also , it does n't appear to have been the `` original reasoning '' when american christians took up the practice, 
  man , these laws are stupid . 
  if one product has been traditionally made in a geographical area larger than country a or b , why should only one of those countries get to use the name ? 
  americans do n't do it because of skyfriend . 
  must be one hell of a sausage !, 
  even more context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians, 
  other do n't see it as simply as that ... 
  context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cham_albanians, 
  i 've heard the same about albanians , who were also between the catholics and the orthodox , just like the ` bosniaks ',

  ** the balkans : ** [ balkan insight ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/page/all-balkans-home ) is a great site . 
  the news articles are free but the analysis and op-eds are paid . 
  [ wikiarticle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_insight ) about it . 
  [ southeast european times ] ( http://www.setimes.com/ ) is nice , but `` lighter '' than balkan insight . 
  it is sponsored by the us european command , the joint military command responsible for us operations in 52 countries , an it sometimes feels a bit propagandist . 
  ** romania : ** [ hotnews english ] ( http://english.hotnews.ro/ ) is ok , but it has far less content than the romanian version . 
  also , the articles are just translations of the romanian ones , so it lacks some context for non natives . 
  it is a right-wing site ( pro-president ) , but generally accurate . 
  [ romanian insider ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/ ) - have n't followed it , but just a reminder it exists . 
  [ romanian times ] ( http://www.romaniantimes.at/ ) - same as above ** middle east : ** [ al-jazeera english ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/ ) - slight pro-qatari bias ( see [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aljazeera_english#criticism ) ) , but generally good [ al-arabiya english ] ( http://english.alarabiya.net/ ) - saudi site . 
  the english version is way less biased than the arabic version ( which i hear has been likened to fox news ) . 
  ( [ wikiarticle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_arabiya ) ) * ps * i would be interested in hungarian news sites in english, 
  actually , about half of the traditional muslim minority is of tatar origin , therefore they are easy to spot , given their asiatic features . 
  but the thing is , romanias traditional muslim minority is overwhelmingly found in only two counties in the southeast . 
  also , we do n't really have recent muslim imigration . 
  most young arabs you 'd see on the streets would be students from arab countries studying in med school . 
  and then there 's the kebab-shop owner here and there . 
  but you hardly feel the presence of a `` muslim community '' outside the traditional areas . 
  you and me both . 
  the same is happening everywhere else in the balkans . 
  old-style normal `` turkish '' islam vs. new , fundamentalist `` arab ( saudi ) '' islam . 
  so far , the muslim countries in the balkans have done a good job kicking fundamentalist preachers out , as far as i can tell . 
  romania is also avidly orthodox . 
  maybe other romanian redditors could expand on this as well for you ( i 'm currently at work , so i ca n't ), 
  the survey includes albania too , and i 'm sure it 's relevant for muslims in bulgaria and romania as well . 
   they are hated because of their culture , so i 'm not sure what 's the proper word for it ) xenophobia, 
  stop with this western bullshit . 
  you are threatening western civilisation * / s *, 
  that is correct !, 
  reddit , serious business !, 
  not really . 
  i was alluding to : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m and the sometimes strong xenophobia of an otherwise liberal bunch : the redditors . 
  well , i understand hungarian , and finnish is completely alien to me . 
  so yeah , 
  exactly , 
  so from one incident that is n't even restricted to gypsies , you jump to the conclusion that slavery is part of gypsy culture ? 
  should i assume that incest-rape is part of austrian culture based on the fritzl case ( and some other similar ones ) ? 
  now keep in mind that there are a lot of eastern-european ( non-gypsy ) gangs that run prostitution rings where the girls are kept essentially as slaves . 
  also , keep in mind that a lot of poor workers are lured into slave like conditions into italy and wherever , despite being promised well paying jobs . 
  but the roles were a bit different : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania, 
   the original magyars voluntarily adopted the christian faith more or less ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_christianity_in_hungary#pagan_revolts_and_consolidation, 
  but more than \u201e no-one '', 
  there are some who truly hate hungarians .
