  a tiny , tiny minority though . 
  most people usually dislike the hungarian politicians in those countries more than the people themselves . 
  the levels of \u201e unpopularity '' have been steadily decreasing , at least in romania , as open borders and cross-border cooperation with hungary , as well as the presence of the hungarian party in coalition over the last 16 years has done a lot to defuse tension on both sides . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gheorghe_funar ) or [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_clashes_of_t%c3%a2rgu_mure%c8%99 ) is unimaginable today . 
  people are no longer paranoid about \u201e hungarians who want to steal transylvania '' . 
  afaik they are sure , but people usually assume they are more closely related than they actually are . 
  i am not a linguist though . 
  maybe / r/linguistics can shed more light on the issue if need be, 
  gypsies speak an indo-european language , the same language family as most european languages . 
  but you would n't say the roma are `` cultural neighbours '' with the danish . 
   culture of stealing , murder , rape , and slavery what culture of murder , rape and slavery ? 
  theft from the non-gypsy is the only thing their culture might be said to condone . 
  murder , rape and slavery is not part of their culture any more than it is part of your culture . 
  there are plenty in romania and slovakia .

  txampion , demand your debts !, 
  no , but the 's a difference between verbal abuse and physical abuse . 
  there are different degrees of wrong . 
  one is destruction of property . 
  the other is blasphemy . 
  one hurts somebody 's property , the other hurts somebody 's feelings, 
  oh come on . 
  you were hinting at it ... 
  what exactly is nazi about this ? 
  maybe not that odd http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98resund_region, 
  i listened to religious crap all 12 years in school , and i turned out pretty ok . by highschool i was an atheist . 
  my parents ' lax attitude towards religion played a way bigger factor in my religious convictions than the religion teachers at school . 
  kids do n't actually believe all the crap they hear at school . 
  it 's 1st to 12th grade now , afaik . 
  and the ammount of hatred-spreading really depends on the teacher . 
  i 've had relatively ok teachers , except one chick who was kid of scary . 
  on the other hand my sister 's religion teacher tells the kids some pretty hateful things . 
  he 's the famous far-right politician that recently discovered he 's jewish . 
  i do n't think he wants the jews out any more . 
  also , racism is not synonymous with xenophobia , as most people who overuse it seem to think . 
   sports . 
  this is how blacks in the us or brazil become heroes and positive role models for their communities . 
  a few gypsy football star would be immensely helpful . 
  we have this . 
  a recent example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banel_nicolita  religion . 
  yeah , i know , reddit hates it because you are intellectuals or pretend to be . 
  but they are not and do n't even pretend . 
  for people in a poor situation and low education level and poor morals religion is extremely helpful . 
  it is not a theory , we have plenty of examples how gypsy families converted into religion , sometimes even whole villages , managed to live much better on every possible scale . 
  this is also happening . 
  [ here 's an article from bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6692881.stm ) it deals with bulgaria , but it 's the same in romania too . 
  a lot of gypsies are turning to neo-protestant denominations , and some of the more backward cultural aspects ( like child-marriage ) are vanishing among these converts . 
  romania too, 
   romania does a pretty good job at trying to integrate the gypsy population , there are a lot of programs in place for gypsies who want to go to university , who want to study and end up responsible members of society agreed . 
  the next thing i want to see is roma ngos that work from within the communities to get shit done . 
  that , and roma role models , that acknowledge their ethnicity , so that people understand that you do n't have to give up your roma identity to become integrated . 
   dude , there 's hundreds of people in romania who turn 18 and go to unqualified work in germany or spain picking cucumbers and cabbage and whatnot , and build a life for themselves there , and rarely come back or keep in touch with family . 
  and some of them are gypsies . 
  you just do n't see it in the news, 
   the gypsies can not integrate and anyone who says otherwise is a damn fool . 
  some already have . 
  but please , continue [ poisoning the well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_the_well )  their forced relocation during ww2 into bulgaria and romania what are you talking about ? 
   what does france do ? 
  they send them back , lock them up , do anything but integrate them . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iif4qhq3aji  you have to understand that they are not marginalized , they are n't pushed aside . 
  riiiight . 
   everything is being offered to them , their children forced into schools . 
  i wish upon your children the same treatment the gypsy kids receive in school, 
   most roma have a culture that is against integration most roma are n't actually . 
  or at least i demand to see proof before i believe this hasty generalisation . 
  the ones that are tend to stick out a lot . 
  the normal ones do n't advertise themselves as roma ( due to the stigma of being a gypsy ) and they are n't perceived as roma . 
   following the closures around lyon , about 240 roma were put on a plane at the city 's saint-exupery airport on thursday morning after agreeing to leave france voluntarily , in return for payments . [ ... ], 
  the compensation given - 300 euros ( # 237 ; $ 317 ) per adult - was a waste of public money , he argued , because many of the roma would return to france . 
  he is right . 
  it wo n't work . 
  actually there is a historical record of a french province doing this in the 15th century . 
  this is not a new idea . 
  or an efficient one . 
  for added context on op see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism, 
  actually , the european part of turkey was their first stop ( give that the current finding talks about migration from anatolia ), 
  reminds me of our own little miner 's marches ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mineriad, 
  filosofum not facit barbam, 
   mostly the fact that different languages often are from different language families . 
  just started a thread that might shed some light on the issue . 
  feel free to comment  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/xtrqq/foreign_language_learning_in_europe_how_is_it/, 
  thanks . 
  i 'll look into it . 
   i would be all for introducing english as the second language across all european curricula , preferably from the lower grades . 
  isnt english the first foreign language taught in europe anyway ? 
  or are you thinking about something more than that ? 
  commie !!!, 
  that , and this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugugzh3ne5w, 
  maybe if germany created a bundesland for the sorbs ...  it has n't happened in the past 30 years of european integration . 
  but i would think that meeting non-locals has been an increasing phenomenon in the eu in the past 30 years . 
  i wonder if there 's any study on this . 
   in reality , a bilingual village has one language group speaking two languages , their mother tounge they will fall back to , and another language they might have learned in school , but are not very competent in on average . 
  or two language groups speaking two languages . 
  for example a village/town in szekler land . 
  romanians have the mother tongue , plus a language that is used extensively around them and they pick up as a consequence , plus it has a degree of official status . 
  the hungarians have their mother tongue , plus the romanian used around them , which is also the taught in school , as the official language of the land . 
  it 's not uncommon in targu mures - for example - to hear people talking to each other switching from romanian to hungarian . 
   so what happens is that the secondary language is used less frequently and eventually vanishes unless it is needed for meeting with non-locals . 
  which for the general population happens infrequently and thus it 's effect negligable . 
  is n't this expected to increase with the european integration and all ?
