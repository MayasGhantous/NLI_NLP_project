  so , as promissed , here are some statistics : * 95 % say they believe in god * 88 % believe in the power of prayer * 63 % believe in an afterlife , 73 % in heaven , 52 % in hell ( apparently more believe in heaven than in afterlife ) * 84 % believe in sin * 53 % go to church at least once a month * 73 % say they pray on a weekly basis * over 50 % say they pray daily * almost half say they go to church at least once a month [ source ] ( http://www.adevarul.ro/life/viata/rugaciuni_din_suflet_sau_troc_cu_dumnezeu_0_314968997.html ) * 90 % go to church ( at least at important holidays . 
  think easter and christmas ) * 6 % go to church more than once a week * 25 % go once a week * 70 % give money to the church * 61 % say that prayer and religious meditation is part of their daily life * 73 % of citizens say they trust the church ( `` much '' or `` very much '' trust ) * 82 % think the church should stay out of politics among the orthodox faithful ( the majority religion - 89 % of ro ) * 59 % say they pray often ( compared to 93 % neoprotestants ) * slightly more than half go to church at least once a month , while 40 % only at important holydays ( on the other hand 90 % of neoprotestants go weekly ) * less then half have a personal priest and go to confession ( as opposed to 2/3 of the catholics ) other practices : * about 75 % of people questioned say they make the sign of the cross when passing a church , and a similar percent practice fasting , at least ocassionally , and respect the day of rest ( aka no work ie . 
  household chores and such on sunday ) * over half get their important ( long term use ) objects sanctified ( more prevalent in the rural areas ) [ source 1 ] ( http://www.soros.ro/ro/program_articol.php?articol=308# ) and [ 2 ] ( http://ph-online.ro/stiri-nationale/item/7556-suntem-un-popor-credincios-70-dintre-romani-contribuie-cu-bani-la-biserica ) * 80 % say that religion is important or very important to them * 75 % say one can be a believer without going to church * muslims are the most religious , but also the most tolerant towards other religions [ source ] ( http://soros.ro/ro/program_articol.php?articol=306# ) some other fun statistics : * 60 % agree with the statement \u201e we base our life too much on science and not enough on faith '' * 4 out of 5 romanians believe that \u201e there are miracles that can not be explained by science '' * 2 out of 3 romanians believe that \u201e the church does not make mistakes when it says something '' * 22 % believe that the horoscope is \u201e very scientific '' ( the highest rate in europe ) * 55 % of rural and 47 % of urban respondents believe that the colour red offers protection from [ the evil eye ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evil_eye ) and my personal favourite : * 42 % of romanians believe that the sun revolves around the earth [ source ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-opinii-7641636-romania-stiinta-ingrijorator-scandalos-sau-trivial-pentru-42-dintre-romani-soarele-invarte-jurul-pamantului.htm ) ps . 
  due to multiple sources , some data may appear twice, 
  yeah . 
  the communists actually forced the greek catholic church to disband , and its property was given to the orthodox church . 
  not to mention the fact that it might backfire . 
  see poland , romania , russia, 
  looks a lot like romania ... 
   romania and hungary are both very atheist countries there is a difference between non-practicing christian and atheist  the youth is 95 % atheist . 
  [ citation needed ]  in the urban areas there are maybe 10 % genuinely religious people , in rest maybe 40 % . 
  [ citation needed ]  the over 90 % for romania is because at the census nobody is asked if they are practicing a religion belief does not require practice . 
  one can be a believer , without going to church every sunday . 
  that does not make you an atheist . 
  it makes you a bad christian . 
  when i get off work , i 'll return in a couple of hours with some statistics about religiosity ( including belief vs practice ) in romania . 
  yeah . 
  people in bucharest are scared of the `` next big one '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_vrancea_earthquake http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_vrancea_earthquake, 
  that was our `` old german overlords '', 
  i for one welcome our new german overlords, 
  * eu+n orway + switzerland , not europe ... 
  the phenomenon you are talking about is called a [ euphemism threadmill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euphemism#euphemism_treadmill ), 
  yes . 
  i 'm guessing it will probably be . 
  it would be hard for an independent to finance a europe-wide campaign . 
  but even then , english could be used as the language for coordinating the campaigns , while the national campaign teams would translate everything into the local language . 
  most of the spoken material would not be live , so theres no reason not to add subtitles . 
  also , if there is a live debate or something , they could use english ( it 's already the default lingua franca ) . 
  i 'm sure they 'd be fluent in at least one more important foreign language ( french or german ) too . 
  on the other hand , written ads would be no problem . 
  they could just translate the campain posters into the 20 eu languages . 
  although not included in these statistics , in romania , about 42 % of people believe that the sun revolves around the earth, 
  i do n't really have that detailed of a knowledge ( i 'm from western romania , not many tatars around here ) , but from what i gather , the turkish and tatar minorities are counted separately in the census , but they are considered one minority when it comes to representation in the chamber of deputies ( in romania , each ethnic minority gets a representative in the lower house of parliament ) , being represented by the * democratic union of turkish-muslim tatars * . 
  also , the tatars appear to be a mix of ( earlier ) nogay tatars and ( more recent ) crimean tatars . 
  i think the main difference people notice is the fact that the turks look \u201e european '' while the tatars have \u201e ( east ) asian '' features . 
  i have no idea if the tatars here maintain ties with the ones in poland or crimeea , but they do have ties with turkey , afaik . 
  ** le : ** there was an \u201e international festival of turkish-tatar song and dance '' in constan\u021ba , in 2009 , and judging from the flags [ in this photo ] ( https://picasaweb.google.com/tatar.officemax.ro/yildizlar#5388499471882967426 ) , ukraine was also represented . 
  the photo is from the [ tatar.ro ] ( http://www.tatar.ro ) website , and judging by their * links * section , they appear to keep in touch with both crimeean tatars and russian tatars ( from tatarstan ) .

  if you 're interested , here are some articles ( 2010-2012 ) regarding the \u201e arab '' vs \u201e turkish '' islam in the balkans : * macedonia http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2010/08/20/feature-01 http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/t7jd6/radical_islamists_protests_in_macedonia/ * kosovo http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2010/03/11/feature-03 * albania http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanian-muslims-grapple-with-religious-identity http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/imam-s-dismissal-sparks-row-in-albania-s-muslim-community * bosnia http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/bosnia-cracks-down-wahhabism * bulgaria http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=120852 http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=130230 ( wikileaks cable ) * romania http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/wl0604/s00311.htm ( wikileaks cable ), 
  we always looked towards hungary as an inspiration , and we always hoped to outdo them one day, 
  i think it 's a mix of internal and external factors . 
  the historic turkish-tatar minority in romania has always had strong cultural ties with turkey , so their version of islam is influenced by turkish attitudes , which are conservative ( so is romania in general ) but not fundamentalist . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , this minority 's imams are schooled in turkey . 
  they are mostly located in the 2 south-eastern counties ( near the black sea ) , and their grand mufti is a young and generally `` liberal '' guy . 
  now the problem is that recently , the number of muslims have started to grow somewhat , especially in the bigger cities . 
  this , i think , is mostly arab immigrants . 
  the problem is that these are stating to gravitate away from the grand mufti 's authority towards imams schooled in saudi arabia , preaching a more hardline ( salafi ) version of islam . 
  this phenomenon is found throughout the balkans ( i 'll look up some articles after i get home from work if you 're interested ) . 
  the grand mufti even warned about this trend in romania . 
  now , to be honest , i ca n't really judge attitudes of muslims in the west for comparison . 
  i had few contacts , and i 'm reticent towards forming an opinion based on the way the media portrays them . 
  also , romania is conservative in general , so traditional muslim conservativism does not stand out against traditional christian-orthodox traditionalism . 
  but salafi attitudes will probably start to become more noticeable , as romania 's muslims will increase , given that we 'll slowly turn from a transit coutry into a destination coutry . 
  we have a very small and moderate muslim population ( although there are signs that this is changing somewhat ) , and there 's no hate really . 
  but ask most romanians about muslims in general , and muslims in the west , you 'll get the usual stuff that people like geert talk about . 
  same here ... 
   why are you trying to protect your corrupt president ? 
  i 'm not . 
  but given the fact that you ask me this after all i 've said means i 've clearly overestimated your ability to understand things . 
  do you know which highway it was at least ? 
  what bad \u201e guys '' ? 
  there was only one left in power . 
  the government is now in the hands of the opposition . 
  so is the parliament . 
  they did n't need to take down the president . 
  not with dubious reasoning and hard-handed tactics ( that damage both are reputation , and the stability of the rule of law ) . 
  the president does n't have much power if you take away the legislature and the government . 
  also , you should have learned by now that there are no bad guys and good guys in politics . 
  not in romania . 
  there are bad guys and bad guys . 
  tbh , i was considering voting usl until ponta started this whole shitstorm ( this plus the icr and the \u201e doctoral thesis '' scandal ) . 
  than why do you criticize me for wanting to uphold the law ? 
  there 's more to the state than hospitals and schools . 
  ( and to make matters clear i do n't agree with cuts in the medical and education sectors ), 
   i remember reducing the width of the highways to 4 lanes from 6 they reduced the with of the a3 ( bucharest-ploie\u0219ti ) highway only partially . 
  it was supposed to have 6 lanes up untill dumbrava ( where another highway will start in the future ) but they reduced it to 4 lanes between dumbrava and moara vl\u0103siei . 
   the complete failure of a few highway projects because of the massive bribes requested by the government . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  any links ? 
  also , i frequent [ skyscrapecity ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1291 ) , a forum dedicated to infrastructure enthusiasts . 
  from what i 've seen , they ( members of the romania sub-section ) have an extremely good opinion of anca boagiu , the boc era transportation minister . 
  you can ask them yourself , by following that link . 
  also there 's a lot of work being done on the a1 highway , as well as on the a2/a4 ( \u201e sun '' ) highway . 
  not to mention the work that 's been done on national and county roads . 
  you can criticise the boc cabinet for a lot of things , but infrustructure is is not the best subject , imo . 
   the infrastructure cutbacks his government introduced what infrastructure do you mean exactly ? 
   you are supporting a president wrong !, 
   i am not qualified to evaluate the legality of the decisions but now you cry foul ? 
  you talk as if you know when i do and do not cry foul . 
   after so many years of illegality and corruption you decide to uphold the law to protect your usurper ? 
  should the law be applied selectively then ? 
   not to mention the fact that plenty of articles i 've read say everything was done fast but completely within the law . 
  bending the law would be more exact . 
  but let 's assume that everything was within the law . 
  the end result is still a weakening of democratic institutions . 
   what is this stockholm syndrome ? 
  i have expressed no sympathy for b\u0103sescu . 
  what i have done was decry the weakening of democratic institutions and the abuse of power by the new prime-minister . 
  i hope you can tell the difference between the two .
