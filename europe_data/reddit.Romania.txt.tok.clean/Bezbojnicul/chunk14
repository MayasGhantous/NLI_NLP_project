  i 'll bite : how so ? 
  you forgot this :  / s, 
   one of the roma girls ended up licking my girlfriend 's ice cream as she got angry we did n't want to give any money  ) i think my so would have thrown the ice-cream at them ... 
  probably the hungarian word is of slavic origin . 
   how visible are successful gypsies ? 
  not very . 
  successful roma more often than not hide their ethnicity , so you only unsuccessful roma get perceived as roma , while the successful ones pass as non-roma . 
  succesfull african-americans really ca n't pass as whites , while roma can . 
   for instance , how often do you see gypsies as your manager in your office , or in political office , or in the music , tv , sports industries ? 
  in romania , you can see them somewhat more often than elsewhere . 
  some of the best known : * [ johnny r\u0103ducanu ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/johnny_r%c4%83ducanu#mediaviewer/fi%c8%99ier:johnny_r%c4%83ducanu.jpg ) - late jazz singer * [ connect-r ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/connect-r_%283%29.jpg ) - singer * [ damian dr\u0103ghici ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/damian_draghici_la_alegerile_europarlamentare_2014.jpg ) - musician and fresh mep * [ m\u0103d\u0103lin voicu ] ( http://media.stiripesurse.ro/2014/02/madalin-voicu.jpg ) - mp and frequent talk-show guest * [ b\u0103nel nicoli\u021b\u0103 ] ( http://yve.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/banel-nicolita.jpg ) - football player ( currently playing for fc nantes ) to name just the first ones that come to mind because of recent media exposure . 
  problem is , people explain them away . 
  i was just adding context to the discussion . 
  that last part was n't necessarily about what you said . 
   i think it shows what kind of attitude ** they ** want to create among russian citizens . 
  who 's * they * ? 
  this is just people trying to make quick money on current events by quickly writing their half-assed dubiously `` researched '' theories . 
  i 've seen the same regarding other events such as the arab spring ( iirc ) . 
  this is hardly a new phenomenon , and in no way restricted to russia . 
   they are still referencing gypsies as `` unwanted guests '' as that would be the default opinion of everyone on a regular basis and that expatriating them should be an option . 
  it 's funny , because the same rhetoric is used by anti-hungarian nationalists as well ... 
  that plus i suck at being a vampire . 
  the closest thing to a mythical creature i 've ever gotten is being someone who does n't hate gypsies even though being exposed to them since forever . 
  [ previous thread on the subject ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/227jji/name_for_the_symbol_around_europe_xpost_rmapporn/ ), 
   i 'm thus not sure if juncker really can be accountable in a real sense , but only in a technical sense . 
  while this is true , the endgame is to make the next spitzencandidate elections into something that has both technical * and * real accountability . 
  trolling on a european level ... 
   as a serious question , do you recall what was on your ballot papers ? 
  yes . 
   are the europarties used anywhere in europe on the ballot papers ? 
  not in romania . 
  they [ hardly appeared at all here , but they apparently did in slovenia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27a2ge/the_battle_for_the_european_commission_has_merkel/chyutrr ) . 
   that 's funny , i do n't remember seeing juncker on my ballot paper . 
  does cameron appear on all ballot paper across the uk ? 
  the * moderate `` turkish '' imams vs. fundamentalist `` saudi '' imams * struggle is happening all over the balkans . 
  i 've seen news pieces with every damn balkan country . 
  even with our minuscule muslim community . 
  crosspost to / r/mapporn, 
  there was some coverage , but nothing front-page . 
  debates did appear in the online press and the printed press ( i do n't have a tv , so i do n't know about tv coverage ) , but again , it was treated as minor news . 
  the public radio had more coverage , as they have `` electoral news '' and advertising by the parties , but the bulk of it focused on national topics or national-centered european topics . 
  all in all , it was a very small part of all the ep election news , and there was n't much coverage of who the individual candidates were and what they stand for . 
  there was only one nothworthy incident , when our president made some remarks about schulz ( see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27a2ge/the_battle_for_the_european_commission_has_merkel/chyutrr ) ) . 
  not really different in this context . 
  imagine if in the austrian census most german-speakers declared their ethnicity `` austrian '' while only a few , more pro-unification , would declare their ethicity as `` german '' . 
   i travel a lot , you know . 
  i 've had the chance to meet with people in other developed countries inside and outside europe , including canada , and so far , people in germany have proven to be the most aggressive and vile . 
  i feel as an outsider here than in other countries . 
  have you been to eastern europe , and if so , how did it strike you ? 
  [ an article from 2010 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/7595054/herman-van-rompuy-publishes-haiku-poems.html ) :  a relative unknown when he served as belgium 's prime minister for just 10 months before becoming eu president , mr van rompuy has become internationally renowned not for his political achievements but for his haiku , a 17-syllable form of poetry originating in japan . [ ... ], 
   his book , simply titled `` haiku '' , brings together 48 of his verses , following the rigid five , seven , five syllable structure , that reflect on the natural world and members of his close family . 
  the poems , with a print run of 2,500 copies , are published in the original flemish-dutch and translated into english , french , german and latin , europe 's `` lingua franca for so many centuries '' . 
   nobutake odano , japan 's ambassador to the eu , would not comment on the literary merits of mr van rompuy 's haiku . 
   and shortly after would hear them talk about their next trip `` home '' . 
  seems hypocritical to me to complain about not getting the absolute same treatment as the locals if you do n't even consider yourself one . 
  i do n't know the exact context , but my first thought is that one can have more than one `` homes '' . 
   some do n't want to learn romanian it 's a bit more complex than that . 
  thank you . 
  this indeed makes sense and is quite interesting . 
  but why do city-folks tend to vote self-det . ? 
  ( that 's what you are saying , right ? ), 
  * edit * someone answered below . 
  may i ask why . 
  yep . 
  why ? 
   sadly , since galicia is a smaller region , its often forgotten by the rest of the world :( i think it 's forgotten because it does n't make as much noise as the other 2 . 
  see [ ** fifth sociolinguistic survey ** ] ( http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/contenidos/informacion/sociolinguistic_research2011/en_2011/adjuntos/fithsociolingusticsurvey.pdf ) ( * of the basque autonomous community , navarre and french basque country by vice ministry for language policy of the basque government , 2013 * ) .

  yeah , forgot to mention this was 2004 data .

  interestingly enough , his comments are quite the opposite of what one would expect from a user with a name like this . 
   one house to represent the people like the ep  and one to represent the states like the council, 
  not necessarily sold , but western europe should n't be surprised in our reluctance to trade american security guaranties for european ones ( if the subject comes up ) . 
   a complete ban on religion was only in albania and it worked : the albanians are not very religious . 
  albanians did n't attach importance to religion as a pillar of their national identity even before communism ( because of existing religious diversity ) . 
  poles and romanians otoh put a much bigger emphasis on their `` national religion '' , so that 's why it came back with a vengeance . 
   this is n't some sort of banana republic . 
  yeah ... like [ denmark in the late 1940 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faroese_independence_referendum,_1946 ), 
  communism was n't that progressive ( instead of religion , they explained gay away medically ) . 
  you have to consider that one group of people they said they represented was the peasantry . 
  and after communism fell , the churches came out with an aura of victims , and repositories of our traditional way of life , which the commies tried to suppress . 
  also , if you go against the church , surely you are a commie !!!, 
  the whole debate started in the 90 's with us , and it 's partially seen as a western thing . 
  it 's just starting to be internalized . 
  it might very well be that the info is correct - we discussed the lack of media coverage a lot this past month - , but the aecr is just using it to their advantage . 
  i mean , from my point of view , the numbers are an argument for , not against , the whole ep-spitzencandidate-centered system . 
  please keep it civil and do n't use this `` all you cunts '' kind of language in this subreddit . 
  you can be passionate and upset about a subject without being rude . 
   did campaign literature/posters in germany say `` vote epp '' or `` vote cdu '' ( or even `` vote merkel '' ) ? 
  i know you asked about germany , but i 'll answer for romania , cause that 's where i live : the european party logo featured as an element only on the hungarian minority party 's posters ( [ example ] ( http://www.udmr.ro/uploads/news/image/hir_3894.jpg ) ) , and none of the other parties 's posters . 
  i did see the european party logo on campaign cars of other parties though . 
  as for the campaign message , it was entirely national-oriented , with the exception of the hungarians who had a regional message ( `` transylvania in europe '' ... ) . 
  schultz visited romania when the campaign began , and [ our president made some negative remarks ] ( http://en.roostergnn.com/2014/05/04/traian-basescu-playing-games-with-ep-president-martin-schulz/123510/ ) , so probably that 's why romania has a high score in naming schulz in the study . 
  via / u/ieya404 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27a2ge/the_battle_for_the_european_commission_has_merkel/chyticy ) . 
  as he points out , there are some interesting implications coming from this study on the whole debate surrounding the spitzencandidates . 
  obligatory : `` fuck yeah , romania is more knowledgeable than the average ! '', 
  we are . 
  especially the german-russian relationship,
