   a step backward for who ? 
  for people who do n't like it when state institutions are tampered with in order get an impeachment . 
  see here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vzeq6/romania_top_court_says_govt_threatening_rule_of/c599oha and no , the ends do not justify the means . 
   perhaps because arc , de , and triomphe , do not have direct english counterparts well , it could just as easily be called the triumphal arch, 
  you 'd be joining a very large crowd . 
  but religion is part of the problem when nationalism is defined ( and maybe even exacerbated ) by religious divisions . 
   i have never in my whole life heard anyone even mention something as absurd as this . 
  not \u201e friend of the jews '' , but the usual \u201e jews did n't suffer under antonescu at all ''  this is pamphlet patriotism that the writer ( s ) of the article misconstrued as something widely believed . 
  it is widely believed . 
   to be fair we have a shitload of churches in europe but nobody prays there anymore not all of europe . 
  romania is very religious still . 
  and apparently we do n't have enough churches , given how there 's a church-building frenzy here , including a [ mega-cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catedrala_m%c3%a2ntuirii_neamului ) near ceau\u0219escu 's mega-palace . 
  ** ro ** [ br\u00e2ncu\u0219i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brancusi ) , maybe ? 
  or [ caragiale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caragiale ) . 
  reminds me of our \u201e [ potato on a stick ] ( http://www.bucharestdailyphoto.com/2009/09/the-potato-of-the-revolution.html ) '', 
  wow . 
  the hungarian dowvote brigade sure is in full swing, 
  ( i wonder how one says fuck yeah in german ? ), 
   by the way , the 2000-2004 and 2004-2008 periods where we had psd & pnl prime ministers and governments , romania was for several years the fastest growing economy in europe . 
  the growth actually started after the isarescu government implemented reforms . 
  and the housing bubble was also a part of that fast-growing economy , and its bursting is partly responsible for the current state of affairs . 
   christial democrat leader ? 
  is n't he from the same european party as the president 's party ? 
  *  for good measure , because most state institutions are run terribly icr was excelently run ( even left-wing commentators , such as vasile ernu agreed ) . 
  so was the national archives . 
  the president 's men , but competent ones . 
  how institutions are run had no relevance . 
  this is political takeover , pure and simple , without regard to management abillities . 
  people would n't be so annoyed , had they only kicked out the incompetent ones . 
  [ europa the wise !,

  call it \u201e god energy '' so the press goes apeshit about it :p, 
  also rip acta day, 
   rmdsz is also seen as corrupt oh , i 'm not going to dispute that . 
   is that seen as an issue by environmentally conscious - or at least not corrupted - people in bucharest ? 
  well , i do n't live in bucharest , but i do n't think the environmentally conscious people there were too pleased with a pro-gold-corporation environmental minister . 
  people in general are n't too pleased with any pro-gold-corporation minister or politician . 
   how does one say in english * kibaszni a biztos\u00edt\u00e9kot * ? 
  \u201e to outfuck the fuse '' , 
   ( i.e. 
  as in belorus ) could you elaborate on that , please ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the language issue in belarus . 
  as far as i understand , romanian/moldavian will also be used in chernovitz and western odessa districts , and hungarian in transkarpatia . 
  what other languages that might benefit from this law ? 
  a very important theory is nearly confirmed , and we now know how mass works disclaimer : i 'm not a physicist, 
  http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/zombie-borders/  for one of the most remarkable examples of this revenant quality of former borders , we need only hop across the oder-neisse line to poland . 
  on the map of post-communist poland 's election results , one curious division keeps cropping up : the old imperial border between russia and prussia/germany , as it existed when poland did not , from 1848 to 1918 . [ ... ], 
   the fit between modern election result and ancient border is almost perfect . 
  but how can this be ? 
  the ethnic composition of the region has been shaken up thoroughly since the border last was in effect : following the second world war , germans were expelled from areas east of the oder-neisse line , and poles moved in from former polish areas to the east , now annexed by the soviet union . 
   yet in spite of these completely different demographics , the former border keeps resurfacing at polish national elections -- a zombie border indeed . 
  earlier treatment of this question [ 10 ] has offered up a few intriguing hypotheses : the resettled poles have n't had the time yet to `` get conservative '' ; the newer polish areas have richer farmland ( or a denser rail network ) , are thus more likely to have liberal politics . 
  but an answer that fits the question as snugly as the old border fits contemporary election results remains elusive . 
   it may seem overly deterministic to link modern election results to ancient borders that no longer exist ; but similar claims have been made about election outcomes in france , ukraine and the united states , to name but a few countries . 
  i have seen similar tendencies in romania , as well . 
  ** map : ** http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/oz2tn/romanian_historical_regions_and_the_2009/, 
  the fact that they also have hungarian citizenship . 
  they 'll probably vote at the consulates and embasies, 
  all this reminds me of a project in paris : http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2010/09/20109517141139327.html/, 
  background : the ruling fidesz party in hungary has considerably eased conditions for hungarian minorities around hungary to get citizenship . 
  probably fidesz now thinks that these \u201e hungarians from abroad '' will vote for fidesz in the next elections ( afaik , they can vote parties , but not individuals in hungary 's mixed voting system ) now , during the romanian local elections this june , fidesz lent its support to the emerging hungarian parties of romania ( ppmt/emnp and pcm/mpp , seen as more nationalist ) , as opposed to the big , more moderate udmr/rmdsz party . 
  udmr/rmdsz won the hungarian vote in romania by a landslide , and this is probably a way of paying back fidesz . 
  but i find the idea extremely interesting . 
  also , see this comment for further details , such as the fact that while the ( relevant ) commision analyzed the doctoral thesis , it was deemed illegal . 
   i had to have two years of foreign langauage in high screw . 
  that is very little in term of foreign language learning . 
  we have 11 years of foreign language nr1 . 
  ( english , starting 2nd grade ) and 6 years of foreign language nr .2 ( french or german ) . 
  we also have to take latin a year or two ( not exactly sure how many years ), 
   latin died out well , it did n't really die out . 
  people just started calling it in differently , 
  also : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-macedonia-nurtures-anti-greek-propaganda, 
  and the next paragraph :  the common international poverty line has in the past been roughly $ 1 a day . 
  in 2008 , the world bank came out with a revised figure of $ 1.25 at 2005 purchasing-power parity ( ppp ) . 
  the vast majority of articles discussing `` the poverty line '' talk about the `` international poverty line '' . 
  i 'm quite certain the ambiguity in the title was intentional , for the shock value . 
   if anyone were living on under 1-2 dollar a day in greece they 'd already be dead . 
  i know . 
  hence my skepticism towards the title . 
  also , the title says '' ** the ** poverty line '' , not `` the * relative * poverty line '' . 
  i would have not objected to the later . 
   the commission also notes that 68 % of the population in greece is living below the poverty line ( note that with income below 60 % of median national income ) and has more than 40 % of their income for rent or repayment mortgage . 
  yeah , this is not what people think of when they hear that someone lives `` below the poverty line '' . 
  they think of the `` under 1 ( or 2 ) $ per day '' poverty line . 
   seems like you have n't visited charleroi yet !, 
  actually , i wanted to end my previous comment with `` fuck charleroi '' but then i thought i might come off as too hostile . 
  our car was broken into there a few years ago , as we had the stupid idea of stopping there for the night , after visiting liege . 
   any romanian cities that are considered ugly ? 
  would love to compare them . 
  well , [ copsa mica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copsa_mica ) is a city in a league of its own . 
  there were many jokes about the pollution level there . 
  also the [ cities of the jiu valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jiu_valley ) are know for their post-mining-town status . 
  maybe other romanians around here will add others to the list . 
  but by romanian standars , liege is not that ugly . 
  it 's ... normal ( sort of ) , when compared to romanian cities . 
  it just stands out when compared to other western cities . 
  i swear to god , liege looks like a post-communist city . 
   they did , but the fucking euro-vultures were orgasmic when it all went to shit . 
  yeah , because europe wants nothing less than war and genocide at its doorstep . 
  spare me the self-victimization .
