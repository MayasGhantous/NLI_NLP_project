  it was the yugo-vultures who tore the country into pieces and set it back at least a decade . 
  do n't you worry , the eurocrats did n't need the breakup of the country to get their hands on the industry . 
  just look at other countries in the region . 
   no the romans did that to themselves . 
  so did the yugoslavs, 
   but the two posts on r/europe in 24 hours about aryan traits seems to be . 
  i posted this map because the other one was posted here , so i figured looking at both of them , plus the article about why people have fair traits in europe ( [ see comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vmqng/percentage_of_population_with_light_eyes_in_europe/c55stkj ) ) , might be informative .

   what does `` under 1 % . .10 % '' even mean ? 
  [ ... ] the same with `` 70 % . . over 80 % '' . 
  it means \u201e 0 to 10 % ( but there is no place with exactly 0 % ) '' and \u201e 70 % to 100 % ( but there 's no place with more than 90 % , maximum being 80-something % ) '' . 
  that ' t how i read it, 
  it 's more like : * 1 : under 1 % . .10 % * 2 : 10 % . .20 % * 3 : 20 % . .30 % * 4 : 30 % . .40 % * 5 : 40 % . .50 % * 6 : 50 % . .60 % * 7 : 60 % . .70 % * 8 : 70 % ... over 80 %, 
   does it also explain the baltics - i assume they are either orthodox or catholic ? 
  nope . 
  estonia and most of latvia are protestant ( lutheran ) , while lithuania , and a small part of latvia is catholic .

   dude , claiming cyprus is a money laundering centre and saying the eu was stupid to get them in is like the most turkish-nationalistic thing you can say . 
  you have n't heard that many \u201e turkish-nationalistic things '' , have you ? 
   of course , they 're unlikely to win over any xenophobes . 
  actually , it probably is n't meant to target hardcore xenophobes , but the \u201e undecided middle '' who , without an alternative point of view , would only hear the xenophobes ' side of the debate . 
  an old man from subcarpathia talks to a young foreign reporter : \u201e i was born in austria-hungary , spent my childhood in czechoslovakia , did my military service in hungary , raised my family and worked in the ussr and now i 'm an old man living my last years in ukraine '' \u201e wow '' - says the reporter - \u201e you must have traveled quite a lot '' to which the old man replies : \u201e nope , never left my village '',

  i do n't understand, 
  romania is pretty centralized too, 
  this just in : he attempted suicide . 
  the ambulance is taking him to get operated . 
  he shot himself in the neck . 
  there were some policemen with him ( he was at his home ) who were about to take him to jail . 
  he asked to go and take some books . 
  a policeman figured out what he was about to do , intervened , and the former pm shot himself in the neck instead of the head . 
  yes , please . 
  can we haz schengen now ? 
   turkey claims a minority in thraki so what if they have a minority there ? 
  so are you one of the people who claims that there are no minorities in greece ? 
  you 're really paranoid about territorial integrity , man . 
  do n't worry . 
  thrace and macedonia are n't going anywhere . 
  hey , the age of colonialism called ... 
   hell , one of the names that was seriously considered during the negotiations was north macedonia , which always seemed like an irredentist 's wet dream . 
  yeah . 
  i 've alwas found \u201e north macedonia '' is way more expansionist than simply \u201e macedonia '', 
  unless that stopped the moment the usa changed its name into something else , your answer misses the point . 
  yeah , it 's like poland , but reversed . 
  they are slavs , but belong to the roman-catholic church , while people associate the orthodox with the slavs we also have a [ greek-catholic church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniate_romanian_church ) , which was pretty important , [ indirectly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9ecoala_ardelean%c4%83 ) , in defining our latin-centered national identity . 
  they got royally screwed by the communists though . 
   next thing will be the minority in thraki explain  our territorial integrity is indeed fragile . 
  i think it 's not . 
  you 're just scared it is . 
   would it be right to back off and accept the term macedonia which defines a big period of our history and cultural heritage used as a part of an insane campaign against our territory ? 
  let me answer with a question . 
  is you territorial integrity and national identity so fragile , that you can not accept macedonia calling itself that ? 
  also , i have not seen any evidence for a \u201e campaign against our territory '' , a campaign which would have no chance of succeeding , btw , given the fact that greek macedonia is inhabited by greeks . 
  i personally think you should let the macedonians use the name . 
   sure , the status of serbian/croatian/bosnian and cantonese/mandarin might be complicated due to political considerations that 's exactly why macedonian 's status is not so clear cut . 
  politics . 
   but at some point languages contain enough differences to be unambigiously separate but that point differs depending on perspective . 
  bulgarians argue that there are n't enough differences from the western bulgarian dialects to call macedonian different . 
  get a flair . 
  it would be nice to see a macedonian flag around here, 
  you 're confusing language in the sense of \u201e spoken language ; dialect '' with language in the sense of \u201e standardized dialect '' . 
  when one talks about \u201e political constructs '' one talks about the latter . 
  for example , you can not separate the 19th century standardization of modern bulgarian from the political climate of romantic nationalism prevalent at that time . 
  it was n't as top-down as the standardization of macedonian , one century later , but it was n't apolitical either , as some would have you believe . 
  the slavo-macedonian language might be late when it comes to the moment of standardization , but it 's as old as bulgarian or serbian . 
  they just did n't call it macedonian back then . 
  [ dacians invented everything , including greece , therefore romanians are awesomer than greeks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ), 
   territorial claims . 
  so if \u201e macedonian '' is an exclusivelly greek thing , do the greeks also have territorial claims over the region of macedonia ? 
  also , if macedonians change their name , will they magically sop their territorial claims ? 
   and many other people have been to the area all those years . 
  actually , genetically , the populations of those areas were not affected by the migrations of historical times . 
  also , another question . 
  the the original bulgar ( ian ) s were of turkic origin . 
  they are slavic now . 
  should they stop using the name bulgar , because they got slavicised ? 
   what 's with the quote ? 
  ups . 
  accidentally pasted it from another reply . 
  ** ps ** i 'm not disputing the fact that the macedonian nationality is a recent creation , or that the macedonian language is closest to bulgarian . 
  but given the fact that all national identities are a thing of self-perception more than anything else , you can not argue that a macedonian identity exists , separate from that of the bulgarians . 
  nations are \u201e [ imagined communities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imagined_communities ) '' after all . 
   it [ macedonian language ] has not created by natural means , as all other languages in the world , but was created by political circumstances . 
  it is an absurd , that it was created on a certain date -- namely august 2nd , 1944 , and at certain place -- the monastery `` prohor pchinski '' , with a decree . 
  such an event has not happened to any other language in the world . 
  all languages are political constructs to some extent or another . 
  only dialects are natural . 
   ~ ~ you know too , how shit goes around this part of the world ~ ~ for two languages to be separate , a lack of mutual intelligibility is not a requirement . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual_intelligibility#list_of_mutually_intelligible_languages also , national identities evolve over time . 
  the austrians in the '30s felt pat of the german nation . 
  post ww2 , they have a separate national identity , based around the catholic and the habsburg heritage . 
  the swiss have a strong national identity of their own , although most of them do n't need translators when talking to a german . 
  and that 's just europe, 
  nice try , irish person disguised as a croat !, 
   you know too , how shit goes around this part of the world yeah , too much nationalism and too much paranoia about borders and neighbors and `` national identity '' . 
  so did a lot of countries , including mine and yours . 
   on the other hand calling your country macedonia which is a far larger region than your country is like you have territorial claims and at the same time not embracing that 1 .
