  united states of america - does the name of the usa imply teritorial claims over the rest of the americas ? 
  moldova - does the name of moldova imply [ teritorial claims over the east of romania ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/moldovatoday.png ) ? 
   i ' m not saying that it did n't happened but the slavic people had made their entrance in the territory around the 6th century . 
  ancient macedonian empire ended up to the hellenistic period and completed with the battle of actium in 31 bc ... 
  the period you seem to talk about is byzantium = eastern roman empire . 
  yes . 
  the ancient macedonians got hellenized ( if they were ' t greek to begin with ) , then slavicized . 
  somewhere around the xixth century , if i 'm not mistaken , the slavs of macedonia adopted the name of their region as a national name . 
   maj\u0103 is from hungarian ? 
  it might be that it 's from a slavic language originally , first entering hungarian , and then romanian . 
  it sounds a bit slavic . 
   what about `` dic\u0103 '' = 25kg i believe , is that from austro-hungaria ? 
  never hear about it , either in hungarian or romanian , and dex does n't seem to mention it . 
  might be of german origin , judging by the way it sounds . 
   i heard my grandparents use it also in transilvania which area more exactly ? 
  another interesting aspect is when traditional units become metric . 
  for example , in transylvania , some people ( old , in the countryside ) still use the old austro-hungarian unit of `` maj\u0103 / m\u00e1zsa '' , , which used to be equal to about 100 kg as shorthand for 100 kg . 
  mostly i 've heard it used in reference to the weight of pigs as `` over 1 maj\u0103 '' . 
  hungarians are not considered `` balkanic '', 
  because contrary to popular opinion , european citizens can reject something in a referendum and not get fucked . 
  actually , my ( hungarian ) grandfather still uses non-metric units when talking about certain things ( like quantity of grains and so on ) , although everything is officially metric . 
  ** later edit . 
  ** inches ( '' \u0163oli '' ) are also used in plumbing , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   i 'd suggest against calling [ ... ] the people slavomacedonian why ? 
   it 's a related , but * clearly * separate language . 
  `` a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' whether the idiom spoken by the macedonians is `` a separate language '' or `` a dialect of serbian or bulgarian '' is more of a political discussion than a linguistic one . 
  see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_continuum#south_slavic_continuum, 
  the technically correct for for netherlands in romanian is '' \u0162\u0103rile de jos '' . 
  but that sounds a bit poetic . 
  mostly people just say olanda . 
  why ? 
  this sounds a lot like the [ katharevousa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katharevousa ) vs. [ dimotiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimotiki ) issue for the ( neo - ) greek language, 
  i like it how you did n't repudiate the \u201e scots are cheapskates '' stereotype , 
  yeah but the way op framed the question made the answers seem like these are things we care about . 
  i know , 
  estimates are around 1.5-2 milion , iirc . 
   only 3.2 % officially ( self-declared at the census , that is ) . 
  estimates put the real figure much higher , at about 10 % . 
  roma who integrate ( in romania ) try to pass of as romanian or hungarian , because being a roma still has an enourmous social stigma attached to it . 
  i personally do n't give a flying fuck , but a lot of romanians would like to clear up the fact the roma and the romanians are not the same people . 
  roma are the people of indian origin also known as the gypsies . 
  romanians are a neo-latin people who get their name from the romans . 
  ( ** le : ** [ told you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/va7em/misconceptions_youd_want_to_clear_up_about_your/c52plxn ) ) also , [ transylvania is not a country ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idtdq8btvrc ) and we are not vampires . 
  i ca n't think of anything else , but i 'm sure the other romanians around these here part will add some more ... 
  yeah , that shit was hilarious . 
   under a rock or under canada :p, 
  theoretically , they are legal tender anywhere in the uk . 
  there was a long discussion thread not long ago about this .

  no , they let the colonies print their own pounds , so they feel more independent and do n't rebel . 
  you accidentally added added a word, 
  yeah . 
  that went great the last time ... 
  bucharest is not budapest .

  a month ago we had this : http://www.nature.com/news/plagiarism-charge-for-romanian-minister-1.10646, 
   i guess greece got flooded by the turks ehm , no . 
  most of the turks in today 's turkey are the previous populations ( including greeks ) that got turkified linguistically and islamicized religiously . 
  [ \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/06/2012617223351982587.html ), 
  eastern europe talks a lot about ww2, 
  i second this recommendation !, 
  the first party gets 50 extra seats, 
  expanding your comment a bit . 
   attacked the social-democratic leader ( geoan\u0103 ) the then sd leader . 
  he 's no longer leader , or even part of that soc . 
  party . 
   on the other hand , it seems that he was a pretty good head of the institute and that many intellectuals support him , regardless of ideological differences . 
  and this is the most important aspect , imo . 
   horia-roman patapievici constantly attacked the social-democrats for the last few years and now that they 're in power , they want him out of the institute . 
  not just him . 
  there seems to be an all out purge right now ( other institutions have had their top men kicked out , including the head of the national archives ) . 
  people do n't usually mind it that much when one party kicks out the old party 's incompetents to be replaced with its own men . 
  but in this case , patapievici did his job well . 
   a lot depends on how much criminal activity this jobbik group does . 
  do they attack and stab immigrants for example ? 
  do they have ties with the police ? 
  do they train violent militia ? 
  not immigrants . 
  gypsies . 
  and the first militia was called the [ hungarian guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_g%c3%a1rda ) , but it was disbanded . 
  now they have [ a new one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_guard_association_for_a_better_future ) . 
  http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/28071-jobbiks-anti-roma-crusade  [ ... ] investigators suspect the hungarian guard , which has recently been declared an illegal organization , of collusion in some of the numerous murders of roma people , which have also prompted criticism of the police , who failed to take action to defend the roma community . 
  shortly after midnight on february 23 , in the roma village of tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy , an unidentified attacker set fire to a house using a petrol bomb . 
  when the residents of the house attempted to leave the burning building , the attacker opened fire , killing a father and his four-year-old son . 
  since last november , there have been five murders of romas , and every week brings fresh news of further attacks on roma villages . 
  the police have acknowledged that the attacks were organized by the hungarian guard . 
  however , this is a view not shared by the new jobbik mep , krisztina morvai , who in the run-up to elections suggested that the deaths in hungary were the likely result of inter-roma feuding . 
   three independent organizations worked on the report on the tat\u00e1rszentgy\u00f6rgy murders . 
  initially , the police refused to investigate the killings , arguing that the deaths had resulted from an accident . 
  furthermore , the report suggests that the police actually impeded the investigation . 
  senior police officers subsequently admitted that racism in the ranks was an issue in the police force . 
  the hungarian chief of police , j\u00f3zsef bencz , even recently acknowledged that the ` professional ' style execution of the attack did in fact imply that the the killers may have been soldiers or police officers . 
  not to mention romania . 
   the thing is that ethnicity happens to play a major role here . 
  well , the publication 's target is the local population , not over-sensitive eastern-europeans . 
  why should they make the ethnic distinction ? 
  do you care whether a \u201e turkish '' gang in berlin is actually ethnically turkish or kurdish . 
  or whether a morrocan gang in holland is actually arabic or berber ? 
  while i agree that law enforcement and prosecution should take into consideration social aspects , - like adapting the type of punishment to the crime , and using adequate reintegration methods depending on social background - should n't the law be equal for everybody ? 
  you fuck up , you pay the price , no matter what your background is .
