  you should face punishment whether you 're from a disadvantaged category or from a privileged one . 
   but you just do n't see that with the roma . 
  because roma who integrate ( in romania ) try to pass of as romanian or hungarian , because being a roma still has an enourmous social stigma attached to it . 
  but there are lots of integrated roma . 
  you are probably being downvoted because \u201e romanian '' does not only designate people of romanian ethnicity , but also anybody with a romanian citizenship . 
  when the western press says \u201e romanian gangs '' they do not mean \u201e gangs of romanian ethnicity '' but \u201e gangs from romania '' . 
  the same way that napoleon is called a french emperor not in the sense that he was ethnically french ( he was corsican ) but in the sense that he was the emperor of france . 
  but 99 % ( - ish ) were done by men, 
  frisian does sound kinda like english .

  oh , then it 's ok . tv + landline phone + limitless connection ( as in no download limits ) is around 25-30 euros here too . 
  but if you want internet without the rest , than can get it for 10 euros . 
  nobody remembers the manx, 
   for 30 euros or so a month what ? 
  30 euro / month for internet ? 
  that 's expensive . 
  here you get an awesome connection for 10 euros max, 
  what about greece ? 
   koreans in japan the so called [ burakumin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burakumin ) of japan are an even better example of \u201e gypsy-style '' minority . 
  wont they be placed in a museum though , instead of their original location ? 
  that kinda defeats your `` organic part of the parthenon temple '' argument . 
  he means that other european countries have to give back things to iraq , turkey and so on . 
  not that iraq an turkey are european . 
   do any european laws discriminate against them ? 
  none that i know of . 
  some might indirectly . 
  i am not sure . 
   it seems that hatred for the roma is very common in europe . 
  it is  are there many of them ? 
  estimates put them at around 10 million , most of them in ( south - ) eastern europe . 
  but it 's hard to give an exact number . 
  many do not self-identify as such ( out of a variety of reasons ) . 
  romania for example has half a million self-identified roma , but the actual population is estimated at around 2-2 ,5 million . 
   is their treatment a big issue in europe ? 
  yes . 
  and a controversial one . 
  we had quite a discussion some time ago here on r/europe about them . 
  see thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/rslmd/how_do_you_feel_about_rroma_persecution_in_europe/, 
  until the 19th century . 
  they were freed around the same time as the blacks in the usa . 
  see article : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_romania, 
   the problem is that there is active denial in ex-communist countries about their past . 
  their history is history of victimization , of being victims of both german and russian aggression and crimes . 
  they deny involvement in aggression and crimes against humanity fuelled by ethnic hatred . 
  even worse is belittling of this that is too practised . 
  as an eastern-european , i can confirm this !,

  [ a map of said expansion ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/russia_1533-1896.gif ), 
  here 's a [ relevant gif ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/5/55/20070125205607%21the_development_of_the_german_linguistic_area.gif ) . 
  i think it has a few problems though . 
  the transylvanian saxons are a bit too far south and the german enclave in belarus should be further east , on the volga , not on the dnieper river . 
  also , the reason they went east was because a lot of them , during different times , were settled in low population area , and you would find said areas in the east . 
  in today 's romania ( transylvania to be more precise ) , for example , there were two colonizing periods . 
  during the 12th-13th centuries , when the so called saxons were colonized by the hungarian kingdom , in order to develop the area , and during the 18th century when the habsburg empire reconquered the area from the ottomans , and needed to repopulate some other war ravaged areas . 
  this second wave is known as the swabians . 
  the first wave became lutheran during the reformation , the second wave was catholic and remained so . 
  you can see their distribution in [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/deutschsieben_b%c3%bcrgen.svg ) but these waves are not limited to transylvania only . 
  you can read further following the links on [ this wikiarticle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germans_in_romania ) the [ volga germans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_germans ) of russia are also an interesting bunch . 
  they briefly had an [ autonomous republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_german_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) in the ussr , but they got expelled around ww2 . 
  some remnants can still be found in [ kazakhstan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germans_in_kazakhstan ) of all places . 
  a more comprehensive article can be found here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_german_settlement_in_eastern_europe, 
  germans east of today 's germany really got fucked after ww2 . 
  also , here 's a map of germans in europe in 1910 : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/german1910.png in romania , we do n't really learn about the imediate post ww2 expulsions that much . 
  but we know we had a lot of our germans that left ( read : \u201e were sold by the state to west germany '' ) during the commie times . 
  people always say that it was one of the stupidest things \u201e we '' ever did . 
  there are few remaining , mostly elderly , most of the german villages are inhabited now by the roma ( gypsies ) . 
  but one interesting anomally is that in [ sibiu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibiu ) , which used to be an important german town , has a german mayor , although there are less than 2 % germans in the city nowadays . 
  he was re-elected for a fourth term yesterday ( and even considered for the post of prime-minister a few years ago ) . 
  also , the sibiu city council is dominated by the ethnic german political party . 
  here 's mine : http://i.imgur.com/t65us.png funny thing is that i would n't vote for my nearest romanian party ( the pnl ) in the coming parliamentary elections . 
  although they are near ideologically , the party leader is a despicable snake whom i do n't trust one bit . 
  also , ideology is a lot more flexible on the home front , as opposed to the ep elections , where i know they will stick to the alde line , and vote ideologically . 
  that 's why i will still vote with them at the ep elections . 
  also they will probably get my vote in today 's local elections . 
  at least the mayor will . 
  the local and county councils , probably , but i 'm undecided yet . 
  also , [ ip ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ip,_s%c4%83laj ), 
   it sounds like nothing else out there it sounds like spanish , with all the lisping . 
  at least that 's how it seamed to me when i first heard it . 
  as old as any other language , actually, 
   in finnish and estonian , the stress is always on the first syllable . 
  hungarian too . 
   i tried to pay with it in a restaurant , but they would n't accept it , which was surprising to me , since in finland i 'm used to people accepting banknotes that are in pretty bad shape . 
  did you try to use it again after that ? 
   and lighting cigars in rap videos must be slightly harder in romania we do it with euros :p but yeah , i 'm going to miss our indestructible money once we switch to the euro . 
  beautifull, 
  they do n't , but they have n't changed that much . 
  there 's more cream , which is a bit softer , and a bit sweeter . 
  still awesome though . 
   this 1 litas ( it 's out circulation ) the woman on it is sometimes called lithuania 's cheapest woman . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vt3qvdclc2w/tz23blyspoi/aaaaaaaaaga/4pav1nrinyw/s1600/biscuiti_eugenia_mare.jpg ) which is a cocoa cream filled biscuit called an `` eugenia '' . 
  it 's been around since the '60s , and is one romanian brand that survived the transition to capitalism . 
  it 's cheap yet delicious , and loved by all . 
  because `` eugenia '' is a woman 's name ( the feminine for eugene ) , and it costs so little , there 's a saying that `` eugenia is romania 's cheapest woman '' . 
  * / slight offtopic *, 
  the romanian leu : [ banknotes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banknotes_of_the_romanian_leu#banknotes_of_the_fourth_leu_.28ron.29 ) , which are cool as they are made from plastic , and the [ coins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_leu#fourth_leu ) which have quite a shitty design , imo . 
  so here 's a story : one year , at the admission exams to the architecture university in bucharest , the applicants had to draw , among other things , a traditional romanian peasant house . 
  so one of them , in a stroke of genius , pulls out a [ 10 lei banknote ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/10l_rev.jpg ) from his wallet and starts drawing  also , although we had a denomination ( we cut 4 zeros ) in 2005 ( i think ) but a lot of people still use the value when talking about prices . 
  so 100 ( new ) lei might be called `` a million '' and 1 leu is `` ten thousand '' . 
  also , you could fold the [ old 10.000 lei banknote ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/rol_10000_2000_obverse.jpg ) so that the transparent part ( left ) overlapped the guy 's beard and mustache , and it looked like a hairy penis .
