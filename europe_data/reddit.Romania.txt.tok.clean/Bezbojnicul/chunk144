  the new 1 leu banknote has a different shaped transparent area so the trick does n't quite come out as it did . 
  my dad once had a northern irish banknote . 
  it was a bit of a hassle to exchange it , as all the exchange offices were unsure what to make of them ( as they never saw one before ) . 
  i think he finally exchanged it at the national bank . 
  i 'll leave this here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_minority#black_african_immigrants, 
   romanians queue as pharmacies run out of medicines ... used to be a monthly headline in romania not too long ago . 
   because until the [ 1 ] moors came , the spaniards and italians used to look a lot like the northern cultures . 
  the new dark skin tones are an inheritance from that time . 
  * [ citation needed ] *, 
  for example gypsies are not considered white ( in romania ) , although i 've seen some that are fairer than a lot of south europeans . 
  oops . 
  you 're right . 
  but nonetheless keep in mind that earlier migrations have a bigger genetic impact than later ones . 
  from that perspective , the hungarian migration into europe is quite recent ( 10th century ad ) , not to mention the fact that finnic ( finns , sami , estonians ) and ugric ( hungarians ) peoples split from each other even earlier, 
  it does , but geographic proximity is a better indicator of genetic proximity than language proximity . 
  they also have the highest rate of negative rh http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rh-#population_data, 
  i 'm curious as how much they are isolated . 
  for example , not including ukrainians and the people of the balkans , makes romanians look isolated compared to the rest of europe in the following map : http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n12/fig_tab/ejhg2008210f3.html#figure-title, 
  not necessarily . 
  it might go back to roman times as well . 
  and belarus , and western russia and ukraine ? 
  had they added those as well , finland would not have been as isolated, 
  see here : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/science/13visual.html?_r=2, 
  true . 
   russia did not create a state called southern ossetia or abkhasia ? 
  also , the unrecognised republics of transnistria ( moldova ) and nagorno-karabakh ( azerbaydjan ), 
   regarding matthias : there was n't really such a thing as ethnicity for high-ranking nobles . 
  [ ... ] the modern attitudes to ethnicity did not work the same way and did not count much back then . 
  yeah , i know , but i was trying to keep the example simple . 
  discussing ethnicity is anachronistic before the 19 century . 
   a popular historical novel ( four winds in transsylvania , l\u00e1szl\u00f3 passuth ) puts romanian immigration in the era of turkish occupation of wallachia , basically people fleeing from turkish cruelty . 
  i know that the \u201e standard idea '' ( so to speak ) in hungarian historiography is that romanians are medieval immigrants . 
  we are actually taught the roessler theory ( that 's how it 's called ) in schools , as a politically charged counter-theory to our \u201e true history '' as well as ways to refute it . 
  but while there surely was romanian immigration into transylvania , there was also a romanian presence earlier . 
  but this is somewhat beside the point . 
   sz\u00e9kelys often considered themselves the descendants of attila i know . 
  i have szekely grandparents , and my grandpa often says this . 
   given that avars were more or less demonstrably hunnish of origin afaik , this is false . 
  the avars , who came 3 centuries after the huns , were a turkic tribe , while the huns were either turkic or mongol in origin . 
  they might have both been turkic , but i have yet to read a confirmation that one is descended from the other . 
  there were many turkic peoples who came from the pontic steppe , including the proto-bulgars , the cumans , the pechenegs , but i think that viewing them as branches of the same tree is more correct , rather than descendants from each other . 
   they are the descendants of avars hungarians found around vienna do n't you mean hungarianized avars ? 
  although early hungarians borrowed a lot ( culturally ) from the nomad turkic peoples of the pontic steppe , i would not consider them related to the turkic people , given that they speak an uralic language ( whose conection to the altaic alanguages is questionable , iirc ) . 
  anyway , the ideea that the szekelys are descended from avar remnants is plausible , imo . 
  another plausible idea is that they are simply hungarians , but because of the different socio-political organisation during the middle ages ( as frontiersmen ) , they acqired a strong colective identity as different from the rest of the hungarian-speakers in ( greater ) hungary . 
  just like the mo\u021bi ( moccok ) from the apuseni mountains have a strong cultural identity , as a bit different from the rest of the romanians ( as blonde blue-eyed mountain-people ) . 
  i recomend : http://www.amazon.com/t%c3%b6rt%c3%a9nelem-%c3%a9s-m%c3%adtosz-rom%c3%a1n-k%c3%b6ztudatban/dp/9732605782, 
   the good thing about academia is that there 'll always be academics willing to carve out a niche for themselves by declaring `` everything these people before me have written is false ! '', 
  like this guy : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucian_boia, 
   also , you almost never meet anyone who is aware of the ukrainian holodomor . 
  not to mention the [ porajmos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos ), 
  an example : if you look at the wikipedia articles for [ transylvanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) cities/towns/villages in the hungarian and romanian languages , the * history * section differs quite a lot . 
  the romanian articles focus on ancient and modern ( post 1918/1920 - [ trianon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) ) while the hungarian articles focus on medieval and early modern times . 
  that 's because between the 11th and 20th centuries , transylvania was ruled either by hungary , austria , austria-hungary , or it was an ottoman vasal state with a hungarian ruling class . 
  on the other hand , the romanian historiography focuses on the modern times , or the ancient times when it was a [ dacian area , or a roman province ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians ) , and can thus include it in the romanian national narrative . 
  another aspect is [ matthias corvinus , king of hungary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthias_corvinus ) . 
  he was of romanian ancestry , therefore romanians consider him romanian . 
  on the other hand , he was fully assimilated into the hungarian nobility , and he was the king of hungary , therefore hungarians consider him hungarian . 
  the differences have softened a bit in the last two decades , but we 're still far from having a mutually acceptable narrative . 
  as a romance language speaker , i never felt the need for it , tbh . 
  actually , an early unregulated market and \u201e neighborhood networks '' between commie era apartment buildings did wonders , 
  sorry , thought you were my cousin . 
  afaik , tv5 shows french movies , often with subtitles . 
  see if they have livestream . 
  just a thought, 
  you should start exporting them . 
  some european countries desperately need a few .

  you only have to come as far as romania . 
  ask for [ manele ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manele )  random example : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk8bb-e1wxa ps . 
  the people in the vice article are known in romania as \u201e cocalar '' ( the male ) and \u201e pi\u021bipoanc\u0103 '' ( the female ), 
  and basque blood in the evening , amirite ? 
  i ca n't hear you unless you use ** bold caps lock ** !, 
   you could say that while the island of corsica or sardinia are not independent from france and italy , respectively , they both benefit from having a more influential voice within the union than those in luxembourg or malta . 
  that is only true if corsica/sardinia 's desire matches that of france/italy . 
  if not , the rest of france/italy drown out corsica/sardinia before they get to voice anything on a european level . 
  i 'm guessing a lot of catalans feel the same way . 
  on the other hand states of the eu enjoy certain powers ( i do n't remember exactly what , to be honest ) , and small states , for example have a bigger influence in the ep , because of mep/voter ratio is bigger in small countries . 
  somewhat similar : http://www.bucharestherald.ro/dailyevents/41-dailyevents/28728-magyars-in-hockey-national-team-refuse-to-sing-national-anthem-but-play-along-their-hungarian-opponent-team  an incredible moment occurred during the ice hockey game between romania and hungary on friday * [ sometime in december , 2011 ] * in miercurea ciuc : the * [ romanian ] * national team members were silent during the national anthem moment , but they sang along the hungarian national anthem !, 
   the romanian national team that won the game with a 4-1 score has 24 magyar ethnics in its composition . 
  the only non - magyars are gamekeeper adrian catrinoiu and ukraine born evgheni pisarenko . 
   libertatea * [ think the sun/bild ] * writes that , during the anthem singing moment , the entire team listened in silence , and when the hungarian anthem was played , some of the team members were more passionately singing than the host team . 
  also , after the two national anthems were sang , the entire hall sang the szeklers land anthem . 
  the same anthem was sung at the end of the game !, 
   would n't they be less relevant in the globalized world if they were detached from spain ? 
  no , because they would all be part of the eu anyway , and the eu is the one that will start mattering more and more . 
  transylvania did not belong to the \u201e austro-hungarian empire '' for 400 years . 
  1003-1526 belonged to the hungarian kingdom 1526-1711 ottoman vasal with a hungarian ruling elite 1711-1867 belonged to the habsburg empire 1867-1918 belonged to the hungarian part of the austro-hungarian empire,

   as i understand , this writer had streets named after him so did [ ion antonescu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ion_antonescu ) until recently . 
  having streets named after questionable people is nothing new . 
  yesterday , a statue was unveiled in bucharest for a poet that was a giant kiss-ass in the ceau\u0219escu regime . 
  he was a good poet , but a shitty person . 
  just like nyir\u0151 above . 
   and now suddenly he becomes a `` nazi '' ? 
  yes . 
  a member of the [ sz\u00e1lasi regime ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a1lasi_regime ) 's parliament , \u201e suddenly '' became a nazi in 2012 . 
   its the typical `` hungarian card '' as currently played by romanians it was n't the romanians who decided it 's a good moment right around elections to try to bury this fellow in romania .
