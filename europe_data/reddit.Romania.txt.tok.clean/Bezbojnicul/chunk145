  but i do agree with the fact that the romanian side overreacted . 
  but it 's election time , and the nationalist bruhaha might attract some votes on both sides . 
  context : [ local elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_local_election,_2012 ) are due shortly ( 10 june ) , and there are 3 parties representing the hungarian minority . 
  odorheiu secuiesc is located in [ szekler land ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeklerland ) , a hungarian majority area in centra-western romania ( eastern transylvania ) , and the 3 parties are fighting for the hungarian votes ( about 6 % of romania 's population , but a majority in the above mentioned area ) so starting some bulshit with nationalist undertones suites them . 
  there is a moderate hunagrian party ( udmr/rmdsz ) , which has been in coalition on and off during the last 16 years , and 2 more radical hungarian parties ( pcm/mpp & ppmt/emnp ) that want to displace it , so they use nationalism as a campain tool . 
  i 'm not really sure which one of these two it is in this case . 
  the romanian authorities are playing along as we 'll have [ parliamentary elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_legislative_election,_2012 ) this fall , and the romanian parties also stand to benefit from the nationalist shitstorm . 
  this is kind of usual during elections . 
  on-air sword-rattling . 
  a lot of people do n't really care about this fuckwad 's burial . 
  i 'm surprised nobody suggested a dove , since we 're hippie liberal pacifists and all . 
  but a dove with crazy eyes . 
  psycho dove . 
  you never know when it snaps . 
  i tend to think of them as somewhere at the crossroads of central , northern and eastern europe , for various reasons . 
  so yeah , 
  it 's consistent . 
  see previous comment . 
  because the article compares poland of 2012 with other countries of 2012 , while you compare poland in 2012 with poland in 2008 ( or some year before the crisis ), 
  actually , one might argue that there is no fail at all . 
  these are not strictly geographic terms . 
  from cultural point of view , poland belongs to central europe ( what the germans call [ mitteleuropa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) ) , but , from a ( post - ) cold-war historical point of view , it belongs to post-communist europe , aka , [ eastern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe#political_and_cultural ) . 
  for ** romania ** i strongly recomend [ sibiu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibiu ) . 
  ( [ see ] ( http://www.financiarul.ro/2011/06/03/sibiu-top-rated-romanian-tourist-city-with-three-michelin-stars/ ) ) also consider [ oradea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradea ) also see this list : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_world_heritage_sites_in_romania, 
  have another one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-r6hcuoem, 
  you might bomb us , so i concede you are right . 
  til, 
  romanian commies moved a few churches as well . 
  some pics in this article : http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/bucuresti-inginerul_care_a_mutat_biserici_din_calea_buldozerelor_0_431957442.html, 
   take away the kids , you break the chain . 
  it was tried , both with gypsies , in medieval spain and hapsburg austria , and with various \u201e uncivilized '' natives , in various anglo-saxon countries . 
  failed miserably . 
  you want irony ? 
  you know how romanians respond to anti-romanian prejudice in western europe ? 
  they blame it on the gypsies . 
  they tried it . 
  in spain , back in the middle ages , as well as in hapsburg austria . 
  it failed http://ling.uni-graz.at/~rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml, 
  hungarian is the way to go !, 
   i do n't know of any local slavs , just avars . 
  the avars had slavified heavily by the time the magyars arrived , iirc . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avar_khaganate http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/avar_kagan%c3%a1tus  this is what i was taught in school if i remember right . 
  school history is heavily politicized . 
  that 's why your history of transylvania looks nothing like the history of transylvania i was taught in school in romania , and which was equally biased . 
   plus i remember that slavs were moved in to the territories depopulated during the turkish occupation . 
  might be true for the southern parts ( vojvodina , slavonia ) , but i dont think it 's the case for slovakia for example . 
  anyway , we digress . 
  do you have any source that says the honfoglal\u00e1s magyars were more that the local slav-avar population , and that most hungarians come from post-honfoglal\u00e1s immigration ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious, 
   and the modern greek language , culture and identity was pretty much artifically re-engineered after ancient roots in the 19th century . 
  this has a grain of truth . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katharevousa but all national identities of the 19th century are ideological constructs . 
  and most languages of europe went through a phase of renewal in the 19th c. and that 's because most european languages were plebeian languages , spoken by the peasantry , yet all of a sudden , one needed a national standard that was equipped to be used in all spheres of life , includding the more cultured and technical ones . 
  for example , romanian wenth through a phase of re-latinization , abandoning slavic words in favour of french or italian borrowings . 
  that was because \u201e latinness '' is central to romanian nationalism . 
  also , keep in mind that the turks of anatolia are n't all invaders from central asia . 
  most are descendants of pre-turkic peoples who got turkified ( linguistically and culturally ) . 
  just like modern hungarians are mostly the local population that got \u201e magyarified '' . 
  so even if greeks got turkified and then re-greekified , it would n't matter . 
  another interesting example is the 19th century finnish nationalism , which was spearheaded by swedish-speaking finns , the so called fennomans . 
  because we 're not saudi arabia , or irak , and the oil was n't enough to sell and make money as fast as he wanted to repay our debt . 
  also , casa poporului and all the other construction projects of the 80s needed money . 
  i 'm not an expert , though . 
  i hope some scandinavian country invades romania . 
  i like the [ united principalities flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/flag_of_the_united_principalities_of_romania_%281862_-_1866%29.svg/500px-flag_of_the_united_principalities_of_romania_%281862_-_1866%29.svg.png ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_romania, 
  i think we did export oil . 
  * something , something * we were here first !!, 
  yes . 
  that , indeed , is true . 
  hungarian as well . 
  ok , color me skeptical . 
  do you have any source for this story preferably english , if not hungarian ) . 
  it looks a lot like a folk-etymology to me . 
  thank you . 
  ok , what is this , and what does it mean ? 
  well , as i said , when the national awakening occured during the 19th century , romanians wanted to reconect with their latin heritage , and distance themselves from the sorrounding peoples of south-eastern europe . 
  france was seen as a model , and the french language as a source for re-latinization . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_awakening_of_romania  in the romantic era , the concept of a national state emerged among the romanians , as among many other peoples of europe and a national awakening began . 
  defining themselves against the nearby slavs , germans , and hungarians , the nationalist romanians looked for models of nationality in the other latin countries , notably france . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_language#french_and_italian_words  since the 19th century , many modern words were borrowed from the other romance languages , especially from french and italian ( for example : birou `` desk , office '' , avion `` airplane '' , exploata `` exploit '' ) . 
  it was estimated that about 38 % of the number of words in romanian are of french and/or italian origin ( in many cases both languages ) ; and adding this to the words that were inherited from latin , about 75 % -85 % of romanian words can be traced to latin . 
  the use of these romanianized french and italian loanwords has tended to increase at the expense of slavic loanwords , many of which have become rare or fallen out of use . 
  as second or third languages , french and italian themselves are better known in romania than in romania 's neighbors . 
  along with the switch to the latin alphabet in moldova , the re-latinization of the vocabulary has tended to reinforce the latin character of the language . 
  knowledge in french as a foreign language is higher than you would expect : see map : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:knowledge_of_french_eu_map.svg we are members of * la francophonie * : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_francophonie also , the political system has a strong french influence . 
  we have a semi-presidential system , while the only other eu member to have one is france , afaik . 
  french architecture was extremely influential on late 19th c. bucharest :  in 1862 , after wallachia and moldavia were united to form the principality of romania , bucharest became the new nation 's capital ; in 1881 , it became the political centre of the newly-proclaimed kingdom of romania under carol i. 
  during the second half of the 19th century , due to its new status , the city 's population increased dramatically , and a new period of urban development began . 
  during this period , gas lighting , horse-drawn trams and limited electrification were introduced . 
  the d\u00e2mbovi\u0163a was also chanelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop tgo previously endemic floods . 
  the extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won bucharest the nickname of `` the paris of the east '' ( or `` little paris '' , micul paris ) , with calea victoriei as its champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es . 
  catalan is the closest thing to occitan , right ? 
   evolution of a culture occur naturally , nationalism is more of an active and instant man-made phenomenon . 
  well you could also say that culture evolved naturally into nationalism , than it acted upon itself . 
   it 's weird that you say romanian culture is more heavily influenced by that of france 's i was saying that it is as opposed to german culture , the two being the cultural powerhouses of europe in the 19th and early 20th century  as i would imagine the neighboring slavs , hungarians , germans , and turkish ethnicities would have much more in common with the average romanian in terms of lifestyle , political situation , climate/geography and mentality than with the distant french . 
  of course . 
  the balkanicity is strong in romania , getting stronger as you go from west to east and north to south   seems to me another example of an active push to change culture in a certain direction . 
  yeah . 
  romanian culture does have a sort of a schyzofrenic approach to itself . 
  it wants to be latin , and western and modern , but it can not escape its eastern-european/balkan slavo-orthodox roots , and it 's not sure it wants to .
