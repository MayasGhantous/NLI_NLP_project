   on another note , i noticed i often have these types of conversations with you every now and then . 
  i see you are interested in studying and analyzing how cultures develop just as much as i am . 
   indeed i am , and i enjoy these conversations too . 
  / r/europe is such a fascinating place in this regard . 
   seems to me nationalism killed a part of the original culture . 
  win some , loose some , i guess . 
  cultures change after all . 
  i guess it was similar to the way the turks went from an arabic writing system to a latin one and the central asian republics to a cyrillic one . 
  also , there is some german cultural influence in the north-west ( transylvania ) , the parts that were under the hungarians and later austrian control , and which had ethnic germans since the middle ages . 
  but the french influence was way stronger . 
  they were our \u201e older brothers '' and our gateway towards renewed \u201e latin-ness '' . 
  but they did conquer most of britain , and from what i hear , the weather is equally rainy there, 
   they didn ; t colonise us at all really i know   there 's a little bit of roman stuff here which i 'm guessing arrived there through trade , right ? 
  i 's your freakin fault for not letting the romans colonize you more !, 
  no , we were in the slavic-orthodox cultural sphere , so we used the cyrillic alphabeth . 
  ( just like the catholic priests used to preach in latin in the west , in the romanian church , until the 19th century , the priests used to preach in old church slavonic ) only in the 19th century , when nationalism was in full swing , did we switch to the latin alphabet , as the national narative was strongly based on our roman ancestry , and our differences from our slavic neighbors . 
  therefore , latin leters were seen as \u201e ours '' , in a traditional-historic sense , while \u201e cyrillics '' were seen as imports . 
  there was also an interesting mixed alphabeth , as we made the transition : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_cyrillic_alphabet img : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:alfbtranzitie.jpeg, 
  context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_prayer#use_as_a_language_comparison_tool  in the course of christianization , one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the lord 's prayer , long before the full bible would be translated into the respective languages . 
  since the 16th century , collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a quick comparison of languages about the book in which the map appeared : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/synopsis_universae_philologiae the 4 maps of the book together : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/hensel_1741_4maps.jpg ps : romanian is not featured on the map :( for the curious , this is sort of what it would have looked like : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg/1000px-romanian_cyrillic_-_lord%27s_prayer_text.svg.png  1850s romanian text ( lord 's prayer ) , written with the cyrillic script,

  as a romanian , thanks for the laugh !, 
  also , do n't forget the former communist countries . 
  honest as a romanian ... 
  having an extra passanger in the car is a no-no even if the driver is not a taxidriver, 
  2 different days : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ve_day http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day, 
  talk to * [ mykeana ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/teel6/happy_europe_day_reddit/c4lxa00 ) *, 
  oh , brits and their bets ... , 
  let me guess . 
  it 's derived from the french system ? 
   all of them with the exception of one use a legal system derived from anglo-welsh law which one is the exception ? 
    maybe you 'll do better this year , but untill then , puerto rico will continue to be american , just like scotland will continue to be british . '', 
   stop trying to backpedal . 
  plural * you * . 
  as in you puertoricans . 
  * vos * , not * tu * . 
  but maybe you know better than me what i meant to say . 
   you 're the kind of guy who tells black people that if someone calls them the n-word , they should n't be upset and should understand where the other person is coming from . 
  i was wondering when you 'd go from \u201e ethnocentrist '' to \u201e racist '' . 
   i 'm informing you , since you agreed with that train of thought . 
  i did not . 
   what we are legally is meaningless . 
  to you maybe . 
   politically , we do n't have a republican party , so politically using the republican party as an example is stupid . 
  i meant politically in the sense that pr is part or the us , not that it has the same political system . 
   after i pointed out the cultural implications which were offtopic since i asked a non-cultural question . 
  read the conversation again . 
   oh , and as an fyi , i am not using the `` appeal to consequences '' . 
  i am not arguing that since i 'm offended , i 'm not an american citizen . 
  you are . 
  you 're arguing that since you and most puertoricans are offended , the word \u201e american '' does not apply to you guys , under any circumstance . 
  which is false . 
   you did n't mean just an american citizen says the omniscient redditor ... also , i never said you yourself were for independence , btw . 
  please , read the thread again . 
  next time somebody says something you do not like , take the time to calmly explain what you do n't like and take the effort to see where the other one is coming from before you put on your arrogant tone and start calling people ignorant . 
  calling the other person ethnocentric ( ? ), 
  just because you ca n't handle words is quite lame , and might work in real life , but nobody on the internet cares what you are offended about . 
  as a romanian , i can relate to this feeling . 
   and i 've informed you we have no republican party maybe you should inform the one who brought up the republican party . 
   so what is your argument ? 
  what happened is that somebody mentioned the gop , you asked why , and i gave a suggestion that it might be because you are puertorican , and by extension , an american citizen ( not realizing that ) . 
  that is when you started getting all offended and saying that you are not \u201e culturally american '' as if culture was the thing being discussed . 
  it 's not my problem that you ca n't get passed your emotions and realize that american is a polysemic word , and that some meanings apply to puertoricans , whether they like it or not . 
  you are americans geographycally , and ( untill independence ) americans politically . 
  you are not americans culturally or nationally , and i have never argued this . 
  and since you 've discovered logic , i 'm sorry to inform you that i have not been using equivocation , as i have been talking about \u201e american '' as citizenship ( point * b. 
  * from above ) since day one . 
  there is no equivocation here . 
  on the other hand , you 've been bringing up being offended as if that 's an argument . 
  it 's an appeal to consequences , and that 's why i 've been ignoring it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_ethnicity i guess . 
  i feel it may be synonimous to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gringo in this case, 
   you 're attempting to make a semantic point that does n't serve your argument at all . 
  it does . 
  you 're just too busy being offended to see my argument . 
   why are you so set on calling me `` american '' i 'm not . 
  i 'm set on making you understand , that even if it offends you , or it 's rarely used as such , the word \u201e american '' is applicable to puertoricans in certain ways , as the word \u201e american '' may refer to : a ) a person from the americas b ) a citizen of the united states c ) a native-american d ) a person of american ethnicity, 
   the republican party was brought up because any topic can and will be twisted into something about america . 
  no more , no less . 
  this is not r/worldnews . 
  most people here are europeans . 
   can those romanian citizens vote for parliament ? 
  choose their own head of state/government ? 
  crucial difference . 
  you seem to be missing the point . 
  a century or so ago , the romanians in hungary could not elect their head of state/government . 
  yet they were considered hungarians , as in \u201e hungarian '' citizens/subjects ( whether they liked it or not . 
  hint : they did n't ) . 
   the republic party was brought up to me as if it meant anything , to better explain some insane notion that republicans are like nazis . 
  except it fails as a comparison because , unless we 're talking about the partido popular , partido independentista or partido nuevo progresista , it makes about as much sense as using french parties to explain to you something . 
  i know . 
  but here 's the thing : i did n't bring up the republican party . 
  i just gave you an explanation why the republican party was brought up . 
  do you really think most of the world knows that puerto rico has different parties than the us proper ? 
  you say that :  citizenship and sovereignty are legal terms , and had no bearing on how this discussion ever came about . 
  americans are foreign to us , just like the french and the germans are . 
  but it does . 
  because you ar not a german or a french colony . 
  people see you as somehow part of the us , and say \u201e americans '' , same as for the \u201e american virgin islanders '' or whatever . 
   except it fails as a comparison because no analogy is perfect .
