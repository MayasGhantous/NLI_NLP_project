   you can say we are `` american citizens '' , but this does n't mean we are `` americans '' . 
  sometimes , \u201e american citizen '' can be shortened to \u201e american '' . 
  just like some of my relatives are \u201e romanian citizens '' but not \u201e ethnic romanians '' . 
  they are romanian , and they are not romanian . 
  and romanian, 
   except nationality has nothing to do with status and everything to do with culture , for god 's sake . 
  nation = / = state . 
  politics 101 . 
  you 're the one keeps making this about culture . 
  it 's not . 
  this is about political status . 
  you are part of the united states of america . 
  for a lack of a better term , you are \u201e american '' . 
  it 's not my problem you do n't understand that the word \u201e american '' has more than one meaning . 
  i 'm not saying you are an ethnic american . 
  i 'm saying you are an american \u201e subject '' ( if \u201e citizen '' is not an appropriate word ) . 
   you 're being incredibly insulting ( in fact , you would even insult the pro-statehooders with that , which you would understand if you were familiar with the political climate ) . 
  i 'm insulting a lot of people . 
  i get it . 
  i might not be familiar with the intricacies of pr politics ( i could not be , i do n't live there ) , but unlike yourself , i am not letting emotions get the better of me . 
   understand that in puerto rico , american means rich , blonde , arrogant foreigner fucking us over . 
  people are for statehood to escape the colonial status , not because they feel american . 
  yes , i know that . 
   first , a lot of scottish people do n't consider themselves british . 
  this is irrelevant . 
  they are , by virtue of the fact that scotland is part of britain , whether they like it or not . 
  just like greenlanders will continue to be danish citizens untill they secede . 
  whether they consider themselves danish in the \u201e national '' sense is irelevant . 
   you do n't know much about puerto rican culture , do you ? 
  i 'm not talking about culture . 
  i 'm talking about political status . 
  is puerto rico part of the usa or is it an independent state ? 
   we did n't choose to get invaded and occupied . 
  but you chose not to become independent , and remain part of the usa . 
  [ 1993 referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_status_referendum,_1993 ) : independence - 4.4 % [ 1998 referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_status_referendum,_1998 ) : independence - 2.6 % maybe you 'll do better this year , but untill then , puerto rico will continue to be american , just like scotland will continue to be british . 
  is puerto rico not part of the usa ? 
   leftist extremists have killed more people than rightist extremists in the 20th century . 
  it 's not a freakin ' contest !, 
  [ it 's all in the style , man !, 
  ] ( http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgmez7hfyx1qe0eclo1_500.gif ), 
   ancient greek . 
  is that actual ancient greek or katharevousa ? 
  he was making an analogy that is easily understandable for an american . 
  because even \u201e the most liberal continent '' has its fair share of idiots, 
  so how is the immigrant romanian population affecting all this ? 
  we gather that we have such a low unemployment because all the jobless romanians fucked off to spain and italy during the 2000s . 
  so i 'm curious how the spaniards view all the romanian workers there ... 
  yes . 
  from facebook :  look at our chart of the day - on unemployment rates in europe - and read miles johnson 's article on spain 's lost generation . 
  more than half of those under 25 in spain have no jobs : http://on.ft.com/igqrxs ( i can not acces the article , it tells me to log in ), 
  pure , aryan blood !, 
   it 's definitely a case of `` so bad it 's good '' . 
  it did raise a lot of discussion , i 'll admit that , which is a positive thing . 
  but i do n't personally feel that it 's `` so bad it 's good '' . 
  ok , some more :  ** moucha : ** tee statue itself is of a certain trajan from the adp [ public domain administration ] who was assigned the task of holding the stray in his arms , which has puppies ( going by the tits ) [ ... ] we also mention that the stray is ill , being intubated and receiving food in the form of a thick salami , which she will turn into thin \u201e sausages '' at the rear end  i for one think the statue is very representative of bucharest :  1 . 
  the dog 's intubation requires a precise surgical intervention - simbol of our mayor-general , who is also a surgeon  2 . 
  it does n't matter that it 's an emperor , he 's naked . 
  [ referencing a poem  our country bears gold galore/but we beg from door to door  3 . 
  you can find the small \u201e sausages '' the dog produces at every turn  4 . 
  the stray 's tits - a simbol that she has pups . 
  how many , we do n't know , and neither does the town hall , symbol of the out of control way the strays breed  5 . 
  the smile on trajan 's face - the gratitude of being able to live in bucharest  ** bogdan : ** i send out an appeal towards the honorable members of the roma community , asking it to come and take the statue to the junk yard . 
  given the fact that it 's quite heavy , they should fetch a hefty sum for it . 
  based on the fact that a heavy iron bath tub was stolen from the hall of the block of flats i live in [ ... ] i do n't think the size of the statue will be a problem for the roma scrap metal experts . 
  thank you in advanced  ** ong ** is the bitch sterilized ? 
   ** chupacabra ** name : \u201e congenital pitbullic myotonia with drunk zoophile magician ''  \u201e dream of a drunk veterinarian '', 
   i love that it is taking the piss at our national myth of origin , right on the steps of the national history museum . 
  is it ? 
  i feel we have a poe situation going on here ... 
  some from here : http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-12130435-video-regal-ironii-adresa-statuii-imparatului-traian-muzeul-national-istorie-propune-pentru-lucrarea-arta-titlul-39-maidanez-ranit-fular-39.htm  ** bombanescu : ** the statue has many novel elements , such as the frigid bitch motif , hesitant at the mechanical and feeling-less touch of its master . 
  he looks away , she 's , literally , rabid with rage , not knowing whether he 's looking at another bitch . 
  not even the fancy scarf she bought recently , nor her bosoms , once so atractive , have the intended efect any more  ** ginel oboreanu ** looking at it , i find two more meanings : that we 're butt-naked [ i.e. 
  very poor ] since [ emperor ] trajan , something that happenedunder this [ other ] trajan as weel [ reference to the current president 's austerity measures ] ; and that stray dogs were a gift of the emperor , which , we , as heirs of rome , should keep in a holy place , just like the cows on the ganges [ ... ]  ** briggs ** if we leave it there , in 100 years the area will be know as \u201e at the flying dog 's '' or \u201e at the weiner and the dog 's '' or \u201e at the dog and the bare weiner 's '' i 'll post some more later, 
  this might be of help : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanians_in_macedonia#history, 
  ... romania, 
   quite a surprise ( for me at least ) . 
  me too , to be honest . 
  i thought he 'd hold out until the local elections at least ( this summer ) . 
  sighi\u0219oara , in transylvania , romania , has a medieval themed festival each summer ( in 2012 it will be between 20-29 july ) . 
  they have knights and stuff acting all medieval , and medieval music , and theater and so on . 
  its quite cool . 
  oh , and it 's held inside the [ sighi\u015foara citadel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sighi%c5%9foara_citadel ) , a 12th century saxon edifice , the historic center of the city , still inhabited and listed as a unesco world heritage site . 
  here 's the site for the festival , but it 's not that informative : http://www.sighisoaramedievala.ro/indexen.html, 
   you 're eu now , is it that bad ? 
  it 's better than before . 
  i 'm not saying we 're like the congo or anything  i mean , you must certainly be better of than say ukraine better than ukraine , but shittier than east germany  i mean , i do n't know , it 's just that at least here there are much more ukrainians immigrants than romanians . 
  you 'll find romanian emigrants mostly in spain and italy  gypsies here that come from there , but they 're not romanians , they 're gypsies they are ( most , not all ) romanian citizens of roma ( gypsy ) ethnicity , but not ethnic romanians . 
   i 'm assuming they 're as welcomed there as they are here . 
  yep , we have our fair amount of antitziganism, 
  romania is much more poor and desperate than the former east germany . 
  so romania becoming \u201e as poor and desperate as east germany '' would be progress, 
  czech republic , estonia, 
   that did n't stop them for turning religious once communism was gone . 
  not all of them did, 
  for those , such as myself , who did not get the reference : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_margarine  imperial is a brand of margarine distributed by unilever . 
  it is known or best remembered for early commercials in which a person who recently ate something with the margarine would have a crown appear on their head ( accompanied by a four note fanfare ) . 
  the commercial has inspired sporadic cultural references throughout the years . 
  the video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvvduwjsjx0 ** ps . 
  ** that 's the president of ro, 
  i like the idea of an elected president , because it would be the only politician * everybody * in the eu voted for .
