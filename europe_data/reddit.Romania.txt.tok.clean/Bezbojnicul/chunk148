  the european parliament is still made up of national segments . 
  pan-european presidentials would have a strong symbolic substance . 
  yeah , i wish romania was as poor and desperate as east germany ... 
  thank you !, 
  what ? 
  also true for farsi ( persian ) . 
  mandarin chinese is also pretty simple from a grammatical point of view ( the tones are the hard part ) relevant : http://bloggingheads.tv/videos/3124?in=03:48&amp;out=09:01, 
  imperial languages tend to be simpler than non imperial ones, 
  i 'll leave this right here : http://hashconspiracy.tumblr.com/post/21139571079/romania-a-surprise enjoy !, 
  how do you define \u201e imediate neighbour '' ? 
  yes . 
  humans have been moving around the planet since forever , and shall continue to do so until they go extinct . 
   ginn & company 's classical atlas , keith johnston , cartographer ( boston , 1894 ) keep in mind that our knowledge of that period has been adjusted and refined since this map was published . 
  plus this is terribly biased towards a western european point of view . 
  it mentions the arabs ( 7-8th century ) , who invaded iberia , but says nothing about the [ avars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_avars ) ( panonia , 6th c. ) , the [ bulgars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgars ) ( balkans , 7th c. ) or [ slavs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#migrations ) ( 6th c. ) , who invaded/migrated to central and eastern europe and fit the timeframe of the migrations period [ as defined by wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migrations_period ) ( 400-800 ad ) not to mention the fact that central and eastern europe witnessed invasions up until the 14th century , by the [ magyars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_prehistory#the_.22landtaking.22_.28honfoglal.c3.a1s.29 ) ( hungarians , 10 c. ) , [ pechenegs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pechenegs ) ( 10th c. ) and [ cumans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuman_people ) ( 11th c. ) , culminating in the [ great mongol invasion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_europe ), 
  as an eastern european , for us , the \u201e migration period '' did n't end until the mongols . 
  just saying , 
  i 'm curious what the alternative to pasok and nd would be ? 
  yeah . 
  they still got work to do , but they seem to be going in the right direction , more or less, 
  the western balkans + norway and iceland, 
  it 's more of a \u201e revolutionary wave '', 
  indeed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-r6hcuoem, 
  yeah , i met a guy in paris , in the hostel i was staying , a few years ago . 
  he looked like an average young somebody from southern spain , or portugal , judging by his skintone and clothes . 
  he was a czech roma whose parents , with him as well , had emigrated to the us when he was an infant . 
  as an atheist of mixed ( hungarian-catholic and romanian-orthodox ) background , i celebrate good food twice ( two easters ) :d, 
  yeah , i editorialized the title a little bit ... 
  i was never under the impression that bregovic is original . 
  he just takes songs from the balkans and reworks them . 
  at least that 's how i see him, 
  it 's northern-ish ... 
  http://euobserver.com/1016/115816  balkan musician goran bregovic has written a gypsy version of the eu anthem , beethoven 's `` ode to joy '' , to be used by incumbent president boris tadic during his campaign in the run-up to the 6 may elections . 
  tadic stepped down wednesday in order to advance presidential elections by eight months . 
   they like the traveller lifestyle this is a misconception . 
  there are virtually no nomadic roma left in romania . 
   try a policy similar to affirmative action to help integrate the roma . 
  we have that  maybe its hard to have white-guilt about other white people ? 
  roma are not considered \u201e white '', 
  there are educated roma with internet connection , and who might be working in ngos that deal with the roma issues . 
  they are not living on the moon you know, 
  not sure if joke ... or bad analogy, 
  some romanians call them , in a kind of faux-politically-correct , \u201e minority ethnics '' ( * ro : * \u201e etnici minoritari '' ) , 
  he 's getting ready for elections . 
  he wants to come back . 
  i 'm waiting for the serb redditors to give us more details on the situation, 
  the french have similar expression \u201e gens de voyage '' ( travelling people ), 
  not just romanians ... 
  it 's a pretty known fact that just giving something is not enough . 
  they need to earn that apartment building somehow , to have a sense of possession over it . 
  if they do n't , they 'll treat it as somebody else 's property , and wo n't give a fuck what happens to it . 
  that 's why , in africa , for example , or wherever , if they want to build something for the poor , they use the future owners as laborers . 
  so they feel it 's theirs , they built it , and they will take care of it . 
  you 'll be surprised to find out that not everybody who dealt with gypsies thinks they are all as bad as some people make them out to be . 
  because you touch yourself at night !!!, 
  on a more serious note : http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/04/20124483120488438.html  serbian president boris tadic has said he intends to resign 10 months before the end of his term , clearing the way for joint parliamentary and presidential elections in may . 
  tadic told reporters on wednesday that he would formally submit his resignation to the speaker of the serbian parliament on thursday . 
  analysts say tadic 's pro-european democratic party is banking on the president 's personal popularity to boost the party 's vote in the parliamentary poll , already set for may 6 , when he stands for re-election . 
   changes , unilaterally , this is a bilateral problem it 's not just as simple as \u201e stop discriminating and they will rise the economic ladder to equality '', 
  i think these kinds of discussions warrant nuance , not hyperbole . 
  caricaturing the roma ads nothing positive to the discussion . 
  you might feel that , but is that indicative of the situation at large ? 
  sociological studies would be more relevant than personal feelings , as they are not so much subject to personal bias . 
  foir example , someone who mostly had friendly experiences with gypsies would see the two sides ' willingness to meet halfway things differently than someone who had mostly negative experiences . 
  one does not stop being roma when one integrates into society at large . 
  just as one does not stop being romanian when one commita a crime or adopts a nomadic lifestyle . 
   they do not let a romani girl marry someone who is n't one . 
  depends on the sort of roma we are talking about . 
  there are many half-romani in romania , so there is some intermarriage . 
  on the other hand , the there are the more traditional \u201e noble '' silk-gypsies who wo n't even let their daughters marry a \u201e lesser '' kind of gypsy . 
  both they and society at large bear some degree of of responsibility . 
  yes , there is widespread discrimination , that is preventing the ones that do want to work from doing so , as well as other forms of discrimination . 
  and , yes , there is a degree of refusal to integrate and a higher propensity towards crime ( both from cultural and socioeconomic reasons ) . 
  both sides should work harder , imo , as both have things to fix with themselves my grandparents are from a small-town with quite a lot of roma , of different sorts ( traditional , assimilated ) and i have met both hard-working honest roma and petty-criminal sort of roma . 
   if they integrate they stop being roma . 
  false . 
  the history of us bashing each others head * is * our shared identity , 
  define \u201e * germaness * ''  countries with more natural boundaries - like the uk , perhaps or ireland . 
  oh wait  we have a shared history history can be read in many ways . 
  scottish secessionists and uk unionists read the same history to find arguments for their respective positions suggested read - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imagined_communities, 
  less than 200 people showed up for the ` european counter-jihad meeting ' in the danish city of aarhus http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/03/2012331142352883844.html, 
  such as /, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union#knowledge  at 18 % of the total number of speakers , german is the most widely spoken mother tongue , while english is the most widely spoken language at 51 % . 
  no-one is asking that of them, 
  there are many multilingual/multiethnic nations w / strong national identities, 
   the european parliament is trying to cultivate a `` european identity , '' with top officials saying that it is the only way to ensure a lasting union between member states . 
  we could start with a common president, 
  it 's not . 
  the origin of the news is http://uareview.com/misionerska-poza/ ( a satire news site ), 
  something of the opposite is happening in the former eastern bloc . 
  due to the communist dictatorships , people are much more geared towards the right ( including the far-right ) . 
  scandinavia is not , and has never been communist, 
  other eastern europeans probably feel the same way . 
  i know i do . 
  i 'm sorry ... http://satwcomic.com/robots, 
   the more honest ages of the past . 
  ah , yes , the myth of the bygone golden age . 
  http://www.lyricscrawler.com/song/3953.html  accept certain inalienable truths , prices will rise , politicians will philander , you too will get old , and when you do you 'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable , politicians were noble and children respected their elders . 
   the americans hated the irish immigrants for a time before turning their ire on the mexicans and finally onto muslims in this day and age . 
  it 's interesting how much anti-catholic sentiment back in the day in the usa resembles anti-muslim sentiments in the west today .
