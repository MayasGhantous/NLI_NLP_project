   our constitution is relatively new ( 1991 , revised in 2003 ) plus , from what i heard , the 2003 revision made it even more ambiguous than it was , in certain aspects, 
  yeah . 
  i do n't like the idea of mandatory military service , but the german system is a good compromise . 
  and as you said it does have its social benefits . 
  one example is my grandpa . 
  he lives in central romania , in the hungarian speaking area of [ szeklerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeklerland ) . 
  he said that the 2 or so years of military service ( in very-romanian [ oltenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oltenia ) ) were more helpful to acquire the romanian language than the 7 or 8 years of school with a teacher of romanian language who barely spoke the romanian language . 
  ( he later completed his studies , and went on to work in public administration , in the ciy of t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 ) . 
  not sure exactly what you 're asking ( a bit tired myself ) , but i think this would help the discussion : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe, 
  it 's a good idea . 
  but we should do it in an organized fashion . 
  two team , inside a large arena . 
  just like the romans did in the gladiatorial shows, 
  ` utopian ' is the word, 
  well , churchill and stalin made certain plans , but it was the greeks who fought that civil war in the late '40s ... 
  pandering to the majority is not the way one judges a news outlet as being unbiased . 
  do you think news outlets should report everything from an orthodox perspective just because the vast majority of romanians are orthodox ? 
  would that mean they are unbiased ? 
  when i mean they are biased i refer to the fact that they abandon fairness in reporting , and do the utmost to spin every conceivable news as somehow being the regime 's fault . 
  do n't be mistaken , i too think the regime has a lot to answer for , but still . 
  i 'm all for critique of the ruling party , but when one does it in a manner that reminds one of fox news , it 's doing more harm than good . 
  especially whit the talk-shows that are basically hysterical anti-regime rants with little substance . 
  a lot of news is at the level of can-can ( for non-romanians : * bild , daily mail * and such ) , but to be fair , a lot of news in other tv stations is like that as well . 
  and do n't think the pro-regime news outlets outnumber the anti-regime ones . 
  i do remember seeing some good pieces in jurnalul ( might not have been in the politics section ) , but i have n't followed them regularly , and seeing who it belongs to arouses my skepticism . 
  i will look into it . 
  the latest low in the antena-style journalism was the \u201e mirela bugetara '' fake reporting . 
  you 'll find more details in the [ / r/romania post about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/quc8c/reportaj_fake_de_la_antena_1_cump%c4%83r%c4%83toarea_este/ ) . 
   sadly most of the other ones are ridden with ruling party propaganda . 
  i admit , i do n't read jurnalul na\u021bional , but [ voiculescu 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_voiculescu ) tv networks are dreadfully biased , and jurnalul is part of his media group , so i am skeptical . 
  i do n't want to start a politically charged argument here ( i have no sympathies for the government ) but i felt the need to point this out . 
   i believe it has something to do with being associated to the slavic nations , thus situating romania clearly in the `` eastern europe '' . 
  i feel that `` eastern europe '' has a much more slavic feel to it , as russia instantly comes to mind . 
  the \u201e balkans '' are much more eclectic . 
  greeks , albanians , slavs , turks , romanians ( latins ) , gypsies , etc. 
   it 's silly , i know , but look at how proud we are at the origin of the language and how different it is from the languages surrounding romania . 
  well , the albanians have the same pride about being unique . 
  and do n't even start me on the greeks   i , for one , do n't agree with the romanians being situated in the balkans because i feel that the typical balkanic music is not part of our national identity . 
  i do n't think it 's abut the music ( although there are balkan influences , especially in the south ) . 
  it 's about the \u201e culture '' so to speak , the turkish influence that still lingers . 
  the whole absurdness of it all , and here i 'm thinking about kusturica for example . 
  but also the politics . 
  but it 's true , sometimes it 's difficult to tell eastern europe apart from the balkans . 
  grew up in oradea , went often to tg-mure\u0219 and on ocasion to br\u0103ila , 
   although , most romanians will denounce the label . 
  i have n't really heard people denouncing that label . 
   only smart part of it is on the peninsula . 
  it 's not only about geography . 
  it 's considered \u201e in the balkans '' culturally http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans#the_balkans, 
  the day you refused to get on the communist train . 
  but seriously , i had n't noticed greece ( and turkey as well ) missing . 
  weird here , [ southeast european times ] ( http://setimes.com/ ) does include you two, 
  [ balkan insight ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/page/all-balkans-home ) ** later edit ** is this suppose to include only anglophone media , or native language media as well ? 
  if the later , i also visit : [ hotnews.ro ] ( http://www.hotnews.ro/ ) and less frequently [ adev\u0103rul.ro ] ( http://www.adevarul.ro/ ), 
  it 's full of idiots :(, 
  hey , i 've heard this guy before : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-r6hcuoem, 
   * the anthropologist bronislaw malinowski had a conversation with a cannibal ( i believe on the trobriand islands ) during world war i. 
  the cannibal asked malinowski how the europeans could possibly eat the great number of people being killed in the war . 
  malinowski replied that they did not eat them at all . 
  the cannibal was shocked , and told malinowski that the europeans were utterly barbaric , to kill so many people when they did n't even have any intention of eating them . 
  *  source : * peoples and cultures of the world * , a lecture series from the teaching company , taught by professor edward f. fischer . 
  above text via [ this forum ] ( http://priuschat.com/forums/freds-house-pancakes/26237-malinowski-cannibal.html ), 
  as a romanian , i agree . 
  do you consider the swiss a nation ? 
   politicians knew this ( and many probably agree ) but did n't dare speak out until it was almost `` too late '' and so they had to go and make up additional reasons to deny bulgaria and romania access . 
  this is exactly the feeling we get . 
  that the netherlands are moving the finishline without warning in the last second , 
  read the link . 
  especially since they elected a new president recently : http://sofiaecho.com/2011/12/26/1734161_moldovas-break-away-transnistria-region-elects-new-president, 
  actually , people in romania are not angry because we deny we have problems with corruption . 
  we know that , and we will be the first to admit it . 
  we do n't even have problems with the fact that there are external pressures on our government to tackle corruption . 
  most romanians welcome european pressure , because we know our politicians are corrupt as well , and have a \u201e `` laissez faire '' stance '' the problem is that the dutch brought up additional criteria in the last minute . 
  romania was under the impression that if we fulfill the technical criteria for schengen , we 'll get it . 
  than , at the last minute , the dutch ( and a few others like finland ) , said that we have to meet some additional criteria , that we did n't know would be required . 
  and we got the feeling that they did this to gain political points with their own electorate at our own expense . 
  had they said from the start that there might be additional criteria , besides the technical ones , we probably would have gotten along with it . 
  we know we are corrupt . 
  but now we feel that we got fucked over for electoral reasons .

  now somebody 's gon na come of as hypocritical when scolding romania and bulgaria on the topic of honesty, 
  while listening to that song , i was looking through this [ photo album ] ( http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150471197823739.390679.663593738&amp;type=3 ) . 
  they worked together beautifully , 
  [ you started it !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufltq-0ue1g ), 
  [ oradea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradea ) is a 30-something year old lower-middle class guy who came from the surrounding countryside and lives at his once-rich and somewhat sophisticated aunt 's place . 
  she is sad because she tries to make a gentleman out of him ( at least partially ) but nothing seems to stick . 
  you can take the boy out of the countryside , and all that jazz ... 
  you have to join before we put you up on our cool graphs, 
  it would be interesting if eu and us would be colored differently, 
  it 's from 1897, 
   appropriate in the sense that greece is stereotyped as idiotic no , appropriate in the sense that greece is is being punished by \u201e europe '', 
  fixed , 
  i think it 's about the greek territorial claims , after the [ greco-turkish war of 1897 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greco-turkish_war_\\ ( 1897 \\ ) ) and not being satisfied with getting only ( internal autonomy for ) [ crete ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretan_state ) ** later edit : ** 1897 , not 1987 , dammit . 
  thanks * naurgul *, 
   you might want to read up on the `` tone argument '' you should as well . 
  let me quote your first link :  * the tone argument is where someone ignores or minimises a statement because , so is then claimed , it was worded too angrily or in a manner deemed too confrontational . 
  * i did not ignore , nor minimize your argument . 
  i actually complimented it , as great input .
