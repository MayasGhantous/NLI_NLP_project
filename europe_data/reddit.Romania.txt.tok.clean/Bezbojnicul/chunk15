   your help is greatly appreciated in most of europe . 
  especially in the east . 
   it 's blatantly obvious that europeans do n't feel threatened by anyone . 
  it 's blatantly obvious that nato is taken for granted . 
  it 's blatantly obvious that europeans feel they can take on any threat they may face without american help . 
  it 's blatantly obvious that what you say is only valid for western europe .

  this is a moderated subreddit , with [ rules and guidlines ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) . 
  make sure you read and follow them . 
  as they should . 
  gay men ? 
   from wikipedia i also see you guys legalised homosexual acts in 1996 actually , the last anti-gay law was revoked in 2001 ( the infamous [ article 200 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_200 ) ) under heavy pressure from the eu ( most people were ok with the law , and of course , so was the church ) . 
  public displays of affection between homosexual couples are still virtually nonexistent . 
  what really surprised me was that you guys had the first gay pride a decade after we had our first . 
  here , you lost this :  ), 
  or `` poker cards '' , when a distinction has to be made . 
   we use poker cards we also use [ hungarian cards ] ( http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic209021_md.jpg ) quite a lot in the western parts of the country . 
  * cruce * ( `` cross '' , a variant of [ * sixty-six * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-six_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) ) is by far the most popular card game in oradea . 
   but i came here expecting words of condolences to the families unless the families of the deceased are known redditors , i fail to see why you would expect this . 
  maybe if this was the thread announcing the shooting , but given that it 's about the apprehension of the shooter , i 'd be surprised to see condolences . 
   ** you ** should be ashamed , ** you ** should know better , and as europeans you should all think before you generalise an entire race based on the actions of individuals . 
  [ ... ] instead , ** you ** 're using this as an excuse to hate on muslims , immigrants , and for some reason gypsies !, 
  you might want to notice that the most upvoted comment here is one which discusses which particular strand of islam is the radical one ( so i 'd say it 's the opposite of painting all muslims with the same brush ) , as well as some differences between muslim communities in the netherlands ( again , something which paints a nuanced picture ) 2 . 
  the third most upvoted discussion thread is about the interplay of of discrimination and identity of second-generation immigrants . 
  i find your generalization of this subreddit particularly troublesome , given the dislike you profess for generalisations . 
  i do n't want to make it seem as if we do n't have a problem with bigotry to some extent , but your assesment of this thread and subreddit seem to be a bit off . 
  please do n't insult other redditors just because they have a different opinion than yours . 
  he 's being perfectly civil , and so should you . 
  map shows largest mep per constituency ( sub-constituency in the case of outre-mer ) . 
  french guyana is grouped with other atlantic tom/dom , except this map is wrong , because the atlantique mep is from s&d , not the left see [ here ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lections_europ%c3%a9ennes_de_2014_en_france#outre-mer ) and [ here ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/circonscription_outre-mer#.c3.89lections_europ.c3.a9ennes_de_2014 ), 
  yeah , but he set it up in a much more toothless version ( the pna ) iirc . 
  yes , we do . 
  according to law 486/2006 regarding the regime of religious denominations :  article 32  ( 1 ) the teaching of religion is secured by law in public and private schools for recognized denominations . 
   ( 2 ) teachers who teach religion in public schools is hired in agreement with the denomination that it represents , in accordance with the law . 
   ( 3 ) if a teacher commits serious violations of moral doctrine or worship , the denomination to which they belong may withdraw consent for him to teach religion , which leads to the dissolution of the labor contract . 
   ( 4 ) upon request , in the event that the school can not provide teachers of the denomination to which a student belongs , the studying of their own religion can be proven via a certificate from the denomination to which the student belongs . 
  so basically this means that the big denominations get religious teachers in public school , while the others can study in sunday school , and bring a certificate from their church , and the grades from sunday school are then written in the `` religious education '' part of their grades catalog . 
  so basically the orthodox church dominates the public school system , except for hungarian schools/classes . 
  in theory religious education should be the first or last class of the day , so the minority kids can skip it , but often they are in the middle of the day , so even if you made a request to not attend the class , there is nowhere else to go . 
  if you want to not attend , due to unbelief , you can make a request yourself if above 18 ( used to be 16 , but they made it 18 to ensure that basically nobody makes the request ) , or you can have your parents make a request ( which is unlikely , because parents tend to be more pro-religion than the kids ) . 
  also , there are numerous cases of parents making requests and being denied or pressured to reconsider by school staff . 
  also , a few days ago , the orthodox church and the ministry of education signed a protocol regarding the teaching of religion in public schools . 
  the text of the protocol shall not be made public . 
  can confirm , i saw him in concert with nigel kennedy in bucharest some years ago .

  wanted to recomend [ citizen havel ] ( http://dafilms.com/film/7188-obcan-havel/ ), 
  it 's not an enclave . 
   the language is related to mongolian actually , that hypothesis is considered by most linguists to be lacking enough evidence to be considered true . 
  see first comments [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1rxmb2/what_is_the_current_consensus_among_linguists/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1qx9nf/is_there_any_new_evidence_for_the_altaic/ ), 
  fair enough . 
   the very strong message of a whopping five to ten percent of votes there is also the `` other '' group which includes eurosceptics as well . 
  the front national alone is another 3 % of the votes . 
   you seem to be very emotional about this issue . 
  yes i am . 
  i got cheated in a very dirty way . 
   you should join ... oh spare me the bullshit lecturing . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qwinihw.jpg ) was the header of all the candidate 's facebook pages ( notice the alde logo ? ), 
  renate weber , mep candidate [ denied that they will join ppe ] ( http://qmagazine.ro/actual/exclusiv-renate-weber-pnl-nu-pleaca-la-ppe-este-o-enormitate/ ) , saying it was `` a story manufactured by the press '' 3 . 
  norica nicolai , mep candidate and first on the list [ also denied it before the elections ] ( http://www.cotidianul.ro/norica-nicolai-pnl-nu-va-adera-la-ppe-234537/ ) 4 . 
  pnl party leader crin antonescu in december 2013 : '' [ i support verhofstadt 's bid to comission president ] ( http://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2013/12/06/crin-antonescu-sprijina-candidatura-lui-guy-verhofstadt-la-presedintia-comisiei-europene-10-59-15 ) '' . 
  norica nicolai in october 2012 said [ the same ] ( http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/international/nicolai--pnl-il-sustine-pe-guy-verhofstadt-pentru-presedintia-ce-281055 ) , speking on behalf of the party . 
  pnl has always been high and mighty about how liberal they are , and have always been part of the liberal international and part of alde since day one and never hinted at ideological or affiliation change . 
  so please do n't insult me by suggesting i inferred things without evidence . 
   i do n't know much about south korea , what 's the tear gas thing ? 
  south korea basically became a democracy in 1987 . 
  untill then it was an authoritarian state basically ruled by the military . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_south_korea * ^ ^ disclaimer : ^ ^ i ^ ^ might ^ ^ be ^ ^ oversimplifying . 
  it 's mentioned at the bottom of each map . 
  you can read romanian , right ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/romania/comments/26iaew/crin_antonescu_%c3%aemi_asum_e%c5%9fecul_la/chrmqc9 ) tl ; dr - i did n't vote for the epp candidate, 
  lithuania also had presidentials , round 2 . 
  they have compulsory voting , so turnout around 90 % all the time i guess , be it national or euro-elections . 
  yeah , no . 
  last time we voted nationalists in the ep was in 2009 , and we have n't had far-right in the national parliament since 2008 . 
  the financial crisis , and the austerity measures - which stung a lot of people hard - do n't seem to have given any energy to the far-right .

   edit - why the constant downvotes ? 
  what was it about my comment that made you downvote ? 
  come on people . 
  please read and follow some [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting ) !, 
  * i am sorry for all the needless downvotes you are getting *, 
   the democratic party was since the 90s until 2005 part of the socialist international and in 2005 it switched to epp . 
  but were n't they a bit more open about it ? 
  they deserve the same fate as pntcd . 
  alde , like always . 
  my vote was n't necessarily for their sorry asses , but for verhofstadt, 
  and so , my vote will get hijacked towards another spitzencandidate ... 
   antonescu said he will propose that pnl joins epp and he does this because the left must not win ec presidency fuckin asshole !, 
  i voted pnl to get alde , not epp . 
  this fucker made me wish i had voted with psd ( s&d ) , and that 's something , because i fuckin hate psd , but i least i woul have gotten schulz , not junckers . 
  god i 'm angry as hell !, 
  from my experience , that 's true of most publications with comment sections in any country, 
  are dk and egy\u00fctt-pm also social-democrats ? 
  * psd is the current governing party . 
  center-left , voters tend towards the rural and the less educated . 
  former commies turned shady bussinessmen . 
  - pc ( junior partner of the above ) is a one-man project of voiculescu , a media mogul - antena 3 is one of the big national news channels - , very shady individual .
