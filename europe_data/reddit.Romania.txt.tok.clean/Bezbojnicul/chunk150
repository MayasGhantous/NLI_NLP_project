   facts matter , not intention , and you posted this map , period . 
  you should mention it to the one who accused me of \u201e spewing propaganda '' . 
  the wording implies a judgement of intention . 
  i read this as \u201e persians '' and wondered what this has to do with europe, 
  that 's some great input , fact-wise , but i take issue with your tone . 
  unlike you , i am not a lawyer in any country , but a redditor who happened to find an interesting piece of information , and shared it . 
  by not being a lawyer , i had no idea whether this was 100 % accurate or not , but be assured , my intention was not to \u201e spew useless and baseless propaganda '' , and i resent you suggesting this was intentional . 
  if you have issues with the factual accuracy of the map , take it up with [ ilga europe ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/ ) as they are the ones who made this . 
  reality does indeed come in many shades of grat , but when one wants to quantify it and compare it , one must find a means of simplifying the diverse issues that vary greatly from country to country ( we do this in economics when comparing gdps , for instance ) . 
  also calling it \u201e black and white '' is wrong , as it does not divide the continent into 2 colors ( above and below 0 ) , but , as with any abstract representation , it does have less \u201e shades of gray '' than reality . 
  [ here 's a . pdf file detailing the criteria used for the map .

  at this moment , it 's about your comment !, 
  truth be told , in some languages the netherlands are called holland , 
  til that * engelbert humperdinck * is a real person and not some grimm fairy tale character , as the name lead me to believe when i heard it mentioned for the first time, 
  there 's a romanian limerick that goes something like  * [ captain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_zelea_codreanu ) , do n't be sad *  * the [ iron ] guard goes on *  * through the communist party * because a lot of members of the far-right [ iron guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_guard ) party jumped ship at the end of ww2 and joined the communist party of romania . 
  * the captain * is the nickname of the guard 's leader , corneliu zelea codreanu ( who was executed in 1938 ) . 
  this is so familiar !,

   the problem is the first past the post two-party system , and until that changes we 're unfortunately going to be putting crazy people in positions of extreme power =( this is exactly what europe focuses on . 
  we do n't mean to say that half of americans are loco , but the fact that \u201e the crazy dude '' has a chance to become the presidential nominee ( or maybe the vice-presidential nominee , just like palin ) for one of the two major parties is really scary . 
  that is why their \u201e europhobia '' comes up . 
  by a guy who probably is a better french speaker . 
  crazy americans , 
  the far-right did have a group in the ep a few years ago . 
  it split up because they fought amongst themselves, 
   insula \u0218erpilor this is translated as the island of snakes , or [ snake island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insula_%c5%9eerpilor ), 
  * [ cough cough ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qk2ce/ouch/ ) *, 
  i found the title a bit misleading , as i thought this was about [ lega nord 's padania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/padania#lega_nord.27s_padania ) vs. [ mezzogiorno ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_italy ) . 
  still an interesting article though, 
  actually , the european parliament 's [ facebook feed ] ( http://www.facebook.com/europeanparliament ) has been \u201e cool '' for quite some time now ( at least i fond many posts interesting and/or informative ) . 
  so does [ jerzy buzek 's ] ( http://www.facebook.com/jerzybuzek ) ( the former speaker of the ep ) . 
  i ca n't remember which one ( probably the ep one ) hosted some interesting ama 's ( live q&a 's ), 
  he might be referring to this :  from the 13th century onward , encroachment by the tartars ( in russia ) and the turks ( in anatolia ) shifted the definition to a more spiritual one : europe came to be identified with christendom -- specifically , western christendom . 
   in this definition , europe ended where turkey began , even when turkey extended deep into the continent proper . 
  when the turks controlled large parts of the balkans , those areas were considered to be beyond europe [ 8 ] , the eastern edge of which was the border between the austrian and ottoman empires . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qhbkn/where_is_europe_you_might_as_well_ask_what_is/ ), 
   only pre ww2 democracies were france and britain .

  context : [ sir humphrey explains foreign policy ] ( http://www.videohippy.com/video/113264/yes-minister-sir-humphrey-explains-foreign-policy ), 
  \u201e minorities ca n't rape yuropean wominz if they are many '', 
  i 'm an atheist , thank 's for asking . 
   it gives it more emotion exactly . 
  it brings it down from the intellectual level to the emotional . 
  just like the religious do . 
   using the word `` fuck '' on reddit does n't make anything irrational or rational . 
  no , but it does bring the level of the conversation down , and i think somebody must meet a minimum level of intelligent argumentation before his comment can be labelled \u201e rational '' . 
   also i find it funny how buthurt religious people read `` fuck religious customs '' as `` fuck religion '' . 
  which \u201e buthurt religious people '' did that ? 
  my point is that * lekotar * calling your post \u201e the only rational comment on this thread '' is ridiculous . 
  yes and no . 
  the black french do n't get nearly this much hate afaik as the muslims . 
  it 's more akin to cultural xenophobia rather than racism , nativism , as the us has seen with every wave of new immigrants ( germans , irish , latin-americans , jews , italians ) . 
  many of the same arguments we hear with respect to islam in europe , we could hear many decades ago with respect to catholicism in the us . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nativism_ ( politics ), 
  saying \u201e fuck religion '' does not necessarily make a comment \u201e rational '', 
  i approve this post 130 %, 
   anybody saying otherwise is * racist * . 
  people should really start using the word * xenophobic * , otherwise they will get the automatic \u201e islam is not a race '' meme also , i agree with your post wholeheartedly, 
   imagine a party where 10 % of the guests refuse to eat because their meat was n't slaughtered according to their ancient scripture.might be , but it still creates an invisible wall between people . 
  imagine a party where 10 % of the guests refuse to eat because their meat was n't slaughtered according to their ancient scripture . 
  imagine a party where 10 % of the guests refuse to eat because they are vegetarian, 
  emotions are always a good substitute for logic ... 
  oh spare me the apocalyptic rhetoric . 
  western european culture is not going to be destroyed any time soon , and especially not by kids eating halal meat in schools . 
  the fact that you find terms like \u201e nativist '' denigrating , is not my problem . 
  [ nativism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nativism_\\ ( politics \\ ) ) is a spot on description of your ideas :  nativism favors the interests of certain established inhabitants of an area or nation as compared to claims of newcomers or immigrants . 
  it may also include the re-establishment or perpetuation of such individuals or their culture . 
  once he 's a french citizen , he has the same right to ask for stuff as any other french citizens . 
  what constitutes a \u201e frenchman '' , whom you so dearly like to defend , is not a technicality , but hey , do n't let me stop your nativist ranting, 
   anyone who abides by french society 's rules is a frenchman . 
  actually , a frenchman is someone with french citizenship . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  i was n't talking about skin color . 
  do they serve vegetarian food at schools ? 
  \u201e the french people '' is not only the non-muslim majority [ / brainwashed lefty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_the_well ), 
  yeah , we got our independence around the same time . 
  cheers !, 
  context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war,_1877%e2%80%9378, 
   that is n't going to change , unless you take all the children from their parents ( which would be very unpopular ) . 
  not to mention , very ineffective . 
  history has already shown that this does not work . 
   there are still people in serbia that think that bosniaks are muslim serbs and that croats are catholic serbs or that serbs are orthodox croats , etc. 
  romanians mostly view serbs , croats and bosniaks as orthodox , catholic and muslim versions of the same people . 
   people here think that the west is trying to destroy glorious serbian nation . 
  there is even people that think that jesus was speaking serbian , that we are not from earth ( we came from syrius ) , that alexander the great was serb ... etc this is mostly familiar ( we have this too ) except for the part about syrius . 
  wtf ? 
  we have the [ protochronists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protochronism ) ( which were influential during the late ceau\u0219escu period ) that think that the dacians are the inventors of writing and civilization , and the forefathers of all great civilizations , from the romans to the japanese . 
  i 've also heard about ideas that jesus was romanian , and that [ jesus was hungarian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_turanism#turanism_and_hungarian_fascism ) ( fringe groups on the internet mostly ) there are a lot of wackos in the world  ), 
   they want us to persuade vlach to feel romanian ??? 
  more like wanting serbia to stop persuading them they are n't romanian ( the idea that they might feel anything else than romanian has not crossed our minds )  its ok but not in that manner ( to block our integration process ) . 
  there has been talk about romanian reaction , and there been some talk about shengen issue . 
  ( eu is delaying your shengen assessment or something and you want to make attention ) yeah , since the netherlands fucked us over with schengen , we had a lot of these dick reactions . 
    i dont believe that there is any kind of ` assimilation master plan ' . 
  here you have to understand that the romanian point of view is influenced by analogy with the \u201e [ moldavian question ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldovans ) '' . 
  long story short : the soviets , and the pro-russian forces in the post-ussr period have stressed that moldovan romanians are not romanians , but a different ethnicity called moldovans , that speak a different language called moldovan , written with cyrillics . 
  this is ridiculous , as \u201e moldovan '' is just romanian with some extra russian loanword , but the ideea is that there was/is a policy to \u201e de-nationalize '' romainians in the ex-soviet regions , and a lot of people have interpreted the vlach organizations that say they are not romanians as something similar ( state assimilationist intervention through subservient organisations )  i dont think that there is a political problem to recognize them as romanians , but our presidents and politicians can not do that ( that was my point ) i understand , but some here are more \u201e conspirationist '' ps . 
  thank you for all the info , 
  in bucharest , it can happen to just about anybody , even romanians , 
   people need to realize that not all cultures and countries are equal .
