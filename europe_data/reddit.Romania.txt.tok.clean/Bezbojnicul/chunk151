  some just are inferior to us this is really not the point here, 
   however i think that the way of doing this is wrong . 
  sure , it was a last minute knee-jerk move , probably for internal political capital ( the elections are coming , and the ruling party is going to fare poorly ) . 
  how 's the reaction seen in serbia ? 
   anyway , what is the sentiment in romania regarding this issue ? 
  well , it 's somewhat of an ignored issue . 
  it rarely pops up , usually when the serb side does something like invent a \u201e vlach alphabet '' , and it gets media attention . 
  people feel that the the \u201e romanians in timok valley '' do n't enjoy all the rights they should ( schools and church service in the romanian language ) and serbia is trying to assimilate them , but it 's seen as a minor issue overall , and many feel that it 's somewhat our fault for not applying pressure on serbia . 
  [ countvontroll ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/countvontroll ) does a good job at explaining these things, 
   not all authorities are invalid because they are in a position of authority i never said that they are, 
  also , top-to-bottom , \u201e white man 's civilizing burden '' approaches will fail if they limit themselves to just a paternalistic \u201e do this and do that '' . 
  authority alone is n't enough ( as history shows us ) but it is necessary on a certain level . 
  on the other hand , the subjects need to be addressed in their social context ( family and community ) . 
  community leaders are a good medium for change ( they can facilitate communication between the state and the problem-community ) , but the single most important aspect is family . 
  there was a series of articles in a romanian newspaper about roma individuals who went from a childhood of extreme poverty to being successful and well adjusted citizens . 
  most of them cited their family 's pressure to study and succeed as the most important factor in their development ( even when others , including their teachers , were telling them they will never succeed ) ps . 
  the spread of neo-protestant christianity seems to be having a \u201e civilizing '' efffect . 
   i think they do n't care wtf is going on in the netherlands . 
  i do , and so do a lot of others to a certain extent . 
   our fundamental viewpoints differ on everything we 're working on it ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism there 's been a lot of talk recently of ` european values ', 
   we want to settle down and normalise - we 're serious . 
  the large majority of roma in eastern europe are sedentary . 
  traveling caravans are almost non-existent also , what does \u201e normalise '' mean ? 
  is having a functioning social structure , voluntarily segregated from the * gadje * , \u201e normal '' ( like the case of more traditional gypsies ) ? 
  is asimilating linguistically and culturally into the * gadje * society \u201e normal '' ? 
   also , how much help would people be willing to give ? 
  housing ? 
  money ? 
  job training ? 
  education ? 
  what ? 
  sometimes it 's not a question of what you ( the state ) give , but ** how ** you give it . 
  since we 're on the subject , this is a great book about gypsies http://www.amazon.com/gypsies-peoples-europe-angus-fraser/dp/product-description/0631159673, 
  happy cake day, 
  i never realized those two words are cognates , but now that you mention it , it seems quite logical . 
  interesting . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  somewhat similar to the aromanians in northern greece . 
  a lot of them claim they are \u201e vlah-speaking greeks ''  ps . 
  so why do you think that the romanians in vojvodina identify more strongly with the greater romanian ethnicity/nationality than the timok valley vlachs ? 
  see [ ethnic map of serbia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/census_2002_serbia%2c_ethnic_map_%28by_localities%29.png ) ( in the northeast ) for areas inhabited by romanians vs areas with vlachs ( valachians ) from [ another article ] ( http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2012/02/29/feature-01 ) :  * radisa dragojevic , president of the vlach national council in serbia , told the serbian media that romania should not apply pressure on serbia because of the vlach community . 
  `` firstly , we do not feel threatened in serbia , and secondly , we do n't feel like romanians , but like vlachs , '' said dragojevic , who is also the president of the municipality of petrovac na mlavi , where he was elected as a socialist party of serbia candidate . 
  *  * pedrag balasevic , president of the vlach democratic party of serbia , says that the vlachs are an autonomous people in the balkans who speak two dialects of the romanian language . 
  `` however , the central question is not whether vlachs are romanians or not , but rather which rights we have in serbia , '' balasevic told setimes . 
  he says that the vlachs do not have education in their mother tongue , or the right to religion in their language . 
  `` those responsible for this are the people from the vlach national council who believe vlachs are serbs and that they should write in cyrillic . 
  they are mostly under the influence of the ruling parties in serbia . 
  nowhere else do people of romanian origin write in cyrillic , '' balasevic said . 
  * the question of whether vlachs are romanians that are being \u201e de-nationalized '' , or a different ethnicity , that speaks a similar romance language but writes in the cyrillic script is causing anxiety among some romanians , who see it as something very similar to the \u201e [ moldavian ethnicity/language question ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldovans ) '' . 
  ( it 's not a huge issue , but it gets mentioned in the press from time to time ) * ps . 
  * i 'm ambivalent about the issue , but thought you guys might find this interesting . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lustration  ** lustration ** is the government process regulating the participation of former communists , especially informants of the communist secret police , in the successor political appointee positions or in civil service positions in the period after the fall of the various european communist states in 1989 -- 1991 . 
  it also applies more broadly to the process of nations ' dealing with past human rights abuses or injustices that have occurred . 
  see my above comment, 
  problem is , the netherlands changed the rules in the last minute http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_gb/features/setimes/features/2011/10/15/feature-01  european parliament ( ep ) members on thursday ( october 13th 2011 ) approved a resolution urging all eu member states to allow bulgaria and romania to join the so-called schengen border check-free area . 
  the call came despite fierce opposition to the bids from the netherlands and finland . 
   '' ** romania and bulgaria have fulfilled all the criteria for successful conclusion of the schengen evaluation process ** , '' stated the document , pointing out bucharest 's and sofia 's bids should be judged `` solely on the basis of existing membership criteria '' . 
   the ep rejected a proposal to introduce additional criteria for the two countries by strengthening the schengen acquis on the basis of concerns related to organised crime and corruption . 
   ** thursday 's resolution came on the heels of a similar document approved by a large majority at the ep in june . 
  it signals a general agreement that the two candidates have done what was required in order to boost security at their borders . ** [ ... ], 
   the netherlands was the country which opposed abolishing visa requirements for serbia , while all other countries were for it ; yeh , they recently blocked romania and bulgaria 's entry into the shengen area too, 
  * sigh * [ it already is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/upuag.jpg ),

  i know what it means , etymologically speaking . 
  but now people think of yugoslavs as south - * western * slavs ( thus , excluding bulgarians ) , and usually forget that it 's more than just serbs , croats and bosniaks . 
  yugoslavs = slavs that shot at each other in the '90s, 
  they should just use the name * yugoslavian language * . 
  i know it excludes slovenian and macedonian , but people usually think of the sers and croats and bosnians when they say yugoslavs, 
  probably the baltic ones, 
   it would be cool if they had also added the language we call here vlahic . 
  it 's on the map . 
  it 's called [ aromanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanian_language ),
