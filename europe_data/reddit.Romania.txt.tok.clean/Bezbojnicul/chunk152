  genetically they are descended of the peoples before them . 
  they were assimilated culturally , but genetically the change was insignificant . 
  all this is irrelevant though . 
  they should call themselves whatever the fuck they want . 
  you do n't see the citizens of rome getting all bitchy about romanians calling themselves that . 
  or germans getting angry that the french use the name of a germanic people . 
  well , henri coanda 's momma was romanian too , so he is tecnichally corect :p, 
   the people that got out of the country and invaded europe are mostly not romanians . 
  most of them are romanian citizens though  they have been put there ( gypsies ) by fucking hitler himself . 
  so , let 's blame germany for the gypsies in romania . 
  wait , what ? 
   the romanian people suffered for 500 years at the hands of the turks so you can prosper in peace , in the west . 
  do n't forget that . 
  every country from viena to the caucasus thinks this about themselves . 
  did you know that the main invasion route from tukey to western europe was not through romania but through what is today the \u201e former yugoslavia '' ? 
   and do n't you dare forget , that even though there was a french empire , a habsburg empire and all that , none of them even gave a hand to helping romania keeping the turks out of europe . 
  yeah , it was the romanians who defeated turkey at the gates of vienna . 
  yep ... 
  reminds me of when i was a child , and cable tv was something new , and the hottest women were the ones on italian tv . 
  the part of romania that borders the republic of moldova is called moldova, 
   udmr ( the party of the hungarian community ) being in the governing coalitions for 20 straight years . 
  actually , 16 years . 
  before that we had [ the \u201e red quadrilateral '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_quadrilateral ) , which included 2 ultranationalist parties ( punr & prm ) . 
  also , they were n't officially * in coalition * during the n\u0103stase premiership ( 200-2004 ) but they did support it \u201e unoficially '' , 
   there are 7 continents [ highly debatable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number_of_continents ), 
  cyprus on the other hand is 100 % in asia, 
  yep . 
  europe should annex the whole world ... again !, 
   being called `` former soviet republic of '' \u201e yugoslav '' is not a communist moniker, 
  don ' y worry . 
  cypus is in asia, 
   we are joining next year ( croatia ) and i do n't think we are fully ready . 
  do n't worry , we were ' t ready either . 
  cheers romania & bulgaria, 
   \u201e greece ? 
  albania ! '' lol  ) . 
  this must piss off a few greeks . 
  maybe not as much as \u201e greece ? 
  macedonia ! '' would have ... 
  i 'm genuinely impressed by all the compromise i 've seen lately between serbia and kosovo, 
   is drinking coffee popular in romania ? 
  i would guess it is . 
  i personally do n't drink that much coffee , but yeah . 
   people would just pour boiling water on coffee grounds and call it coffee here too . 
  also , in the southern parts , there is a tradition of making [ turkish coffee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_coffee#romania ) i have no idea if the pisswasser you find in village bistros qualifies as \u201e proper esspresso '' , but urban establishments do have then . 
  i know and agree with what you 've said , but you ca n't really be surprised that the \u201e hungarian = asian '' stereotype pops up , given the somewhat foreign nature of the hungarian language , and the history of the honfoglal\u00e1s , about which other europeans know only that \u201e hungarians came from the east/from asia , and settled here '' . 
  people do n't know all the detail , and you 'll be lucky if they do n't equate huns with hungarians . 
  also , go on any article in the romanian press that deals with the hungarian minority ( especially in a political context ) an you 'll most likely find one idiotic comment on the lines of \u201e go back to asia '' . 
  about anything from 0,7 $ ( village bistro ) to 1.2 - 1.5 $ ( average city , normal range ) to 2 $ ( bucharest fancy-place ), 
   romanians are ... smart googlebomb campaign was successful http://www.romaniansaresmart.com/, 
   hungarians are ... asian . 
  excelent idea !, 
  historical grudges are a shitty reason in my opinion . 
  the present should dictate why russian should or should not become second language . 
  actually europe stops on the caucasus mountain range ( [ see map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png ) ) . 
  so everything to the south is in asia , and is called transcaucasia ( basically gorgia azerbaidjan and armenia ) . 
  on the other hand , the areas to the north , called ciscaucasia , are in europe geographically , and consequently , all the non-indo-european languages there are in europe . 
  look at [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/ethnic_groups_in_caucasus_region_2009.jpg ) . 
  everything that is inside russia is on european soil . 
  chechens , ingush , all the dagestani peoples , the circassians , as well as turkic peoples suck as the nogay , balkar , kabardin and the mongolic kalmyks further north, 
   above the `` weisswurst\u00e4quator '' this needs an explanation, 
   korttelikapakan for instance looks very similar to k\u00f6rtep\u00e1linka ( plum brandy ) . 
  first thing on my mind too  ), 
  i think this might help the conversation : [ map of german dialects , 1894 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/brockhaus_1894_deutsche_mundarten.jpg ) also , apparently , the [ german standard language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_language#origins ) is based on the southern , [ high german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_german ) , dialects, 
   to me it seems like the czech are speaking in diminitives , which is very sweet . 
  i 've heard this before , 
  a [ dialect continuum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_continuum#south_slavic_continuum ) , as they say, 
  \u201e a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' , as they say  ps . 
  interesting post, 
  same here . 
  i understand italian quite well ( italian tv was easy to decipher as a kid ) . 
  also spanish a bit . 
  and french and portuguese , more the written version than the spoken one , but i learnt french in school . 
  or turkish and azeri . 
  or many other non-indo-european languages from the european part of russia ( especially the caucasus ), 
  i really have no idea . 
  we have one nuclear power plant , with 2 out of 5 reactors finished : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cernavod%c4%83_nuclear_power_plant, 
  i see . 
  thank you . 
  what ? 
   i 'm guessing the romanian hungarian party is just as shitty as the serbian hungarian party , which supported the milosevic government . 
  the rmdsz hungarian party here would never have supported [ prm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_romania_party ) . 
  they were ( and are ) sworn enemies . 
  but the party does have its fare share of corrupt folk . 
  verestoy attila is the most notorious for his business involving timber ( from the forests of the szekler land )  you know , maybe the romanian romanian parties should fix the situation on their own , without pressure from the minorities . 
  the romanian romanian parties do not have platforms for the hungarian constituency . 
  even in areas where hungarians form the majority , the ro-ro parties represent the romanians . 
  i guess the unwritten consensus is that hungarians are the rmdsz 's constituency . 
  plus the fact that addressing hungarian issues by a ro ro party is risky politically . 
  they would probably lose votes in the non-transylvanian areas of romania . 
  also , the rmdsz is the more moderate of the 3 hungarian parties ( and the oldest and the only one to have mps ) . 
  the others are the [ hungarian civic party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_civic_party_\\ ( romania \\ ) ) and [ l\u00e1szl\u00f3 t\u0151k\u00e9s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laszlo_tokes ) 's people 's hungarian transylvanian party ( or something along those lines , a rather new party ) . 
  i would personally like to see something more inclusive along the lines of the [ most - hid party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most%e2%80%93h%c3%add ) from slovakia . 
   asia-pacific & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  romanian ... forever alone ( yeah , yeah , i know romanian is different because of the slavic influence ), 
   together with a plan to teach more subjects in lithuanian ( especially history of lithuania ) i really do n't understand why people are obsessed with teaching the \u201e national history '' in the majority language . 
  lithuanian history does n't change if it 's taught in a different language . 
   even if you solve this one , they will pick something else and try to make everyone ( poland and eu ) think polish people in lithuania is somehow an abused minority . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's how minority parties work . 
  and it 's ok , and nothing bad happens .
