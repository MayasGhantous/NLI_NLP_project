  hungarians in romania , for example , have gained a lot of rights during the past 20 years , and the majority population have gone from being vehemently against it to accepting it . 
  there is still work to do , but trust me , there is a point , where asking for more and claiming discrimination gets you less and less attention internationally . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  on the other hand , the situation in general is far better than in lithuania on a lot of issues . 
  hungarians ( and other minorities too ) have education in the minority language , nobody is trying to romanianise their name ( like they did before 1989 ) , nobody cares really if store signs and city signs are bilingual ( except in cluj , maybe ) and so on . 
  i agree that the situation with the cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s is serious , but it 's more of a local problem than a generalized thing for the whole country . 
  i wonder why udmr/rmdsz ( the hungarian political party , for those who do n't know ) does n't do more for the cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s though . 
  i mean they have been in coalitions with the ruling party / - ies pretty much for the last 16 years , having managed to secure quite a lot of rights for the hungarians here . 
  this resembles some of the discussions romania had about its hungarian minority , their divergent view of the past , hungarian language rights and hungary 's involvement with hungarian politicians in romania . 
   i m so tired to hear that we are frauds and lazy . 
  it 's very easy when somebody is down to tell him that it 's his fault . 
  you might be tired of hearing that it 's your fault , but it 's still pretty much true , and greeks should learn something from it . 
  saying that it 's not your fault but the mp 's is just a cheap way of not taking responsibility . 
  all of greek society is responsible , not just the politicians ( which were voted in by the greeks , btw ) . 
   but when it comes to our sovereignty i will chose my country and my dignity . 
  you signed off your sovereignty when you got on the euro bandwagon . 
  it 's like a marriage . 
  you share both the good , * and the bad * . 
  so only mps partake in tax evasion in greece ? 
  troll the family . 
  marry an andalusian :p, 
   in my post above i actually said that the romanian culture is somewhere between the culture of all our neighbors . 
  labeling romanians as balkanic is an over-simplification . 
  well , truth be told , balkanic is a somewhat fuzzy term . 
  and i do n't have a problem with your nouances , but i felt you were running away from our balkanness . 
  also , keep in mind that the capital is in the most balkanic part of romania , so maybe that ads an extra balkanness to the country . 
  as a transylvanian with relatives in greece , i know we are not * that * balkanic , but that we also are . 
   it is one more aspect in which thracians are not our `` primary ancestor '' i think thracians ( if we accept dacians as a subset of thracians ) are our ancestors in a genetic sense of the way . 
  oversimplification : if we wan na go back all the way our ancestors are the first who settled here , who somewhere along the way got indo-europeanised , became \u201e dacians '' then those guys got latinised , than later those same guys got partially slavicised . 
  i have a greek family name , that came through the ukrainian language , a romanian father , a szekler hungarian mother , armenian and italian ancestors , asian eyes , not to mention a cousin who 's a greek citizen and studies in britain . 
  i am a \u201e european '' , i guess . 
  primary ancestors of all europeans are the first fuckers who came to europe ( way before the proto-indo-europeans ), 
   you seem to want to paint the romanians as more balkanic then we are . 
  i do n't think he does . 
  we 're pretty balcanic . 
  also evident in language ( since that came up ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund  the [ 1 ] balkan peninsula does n't even contain romania . 
  and europe does n't contain cyprus . 
  but cyprus is european , and romania is balcanic, 
   culturally , most important would be the language . 
  as * flyingorange * said , that is untrue . 
  but i do understand why you would say that . 
  the romanian national narrative puts an incredibly large emphasis on language as a defining characteristic of \u201e romanian culture '' ( in opposition to the slavic neighbors ) . 
  but speaking a romance language does not mean that the culture is closer to italian and french , rather than to the surrounding eastern european peoples . 
  i think culturally , the turks , the slavs and the byzantines with orthodoxy have had a far grater influence on romanian culture than latin , and latin/romance culture . 
   i do n't think so , you can speak chinese but it wo n't make you a chinaman . 
  it does if others ( primarily other chinamen ) recognize you as such, 
   lately truth be told , this is at least 2 years old http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_economy_act_2010, 
  thank you, 
   `` bulgarian model '' & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; you mean , the \u201e romanian model '' / jk, 
  translation ? 
  we had one snowfall in early january and in melted in about 24 hours . 
  it 's below 0 \u00b0 c right now , but no snow . 
  western romania is weird that way, 
  the turd makes me sad :(, 
  til that bulgaria did not deport jews except from the newly occupied teritorries, 
   in countries were the job market is free to act , people from all generations share the burden of unemployment i disagree . 
  i think the oldest and the youngest in the workforce will always be in a disadvantage . 
  the young are too young and inexperienced , while the old are too inflexible and slow to adapt to change . 
  ups . 
  you 're right . 
  i remembered 2 separate news items , and my memory probably fused them into a single event : 1 . 
  [ that the pirates joined the greens and they will vote as the greens ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/06/swedish-pirate-party-mep-joins-the-green-group-/65332.aspx ) 2 . 
  [ that the greens adopted the pirates ' position on copyright ] ( http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111007/01093816244/heres-surprise-eu-green-party-adopts-pirate-partys-position-copyright.shtml ), 
  ~ ~ that 's because ~ ~ the pirate party mep ( s ) joind the green/efa group and they have an agreement as follows : greens vote according to the pirate party on technology/internet related issues * ( as they already had a similar position on these issues ) * and the pirate party votes on anything else according to the greens ** ps : ** * i made some edits , as i remembered things incorrectly . 
  i got the idea that it was neutrality . 
  either promoting no culture or promoting minority cultures along with the majority culture, 
  the \u201e nationalism '' part really needs a reform if they want to solve the kurdish issue . 
   i 'd rather live in a society where the government does n't try to promote any culture . 
  is n't that the general ideea of multi-kulti ? 
  internet . 
  serious business !, 
  a word 's meaning does not have to be exactly its etymology . 
  therefore \u201e antisemitic '' does not have to mean \u201e againts semites ( in general ) '' any more than \u201e understanding '' has to mean \u201e standing under something '' . 
  \u201e antisemite '' has a [ very clear meaning ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisemitism ) in the english language , and that meaning refers to jews , not semites in general . 
  the idea that ashkenazi jews are of european descent is overruled by genetic studies . 
  while there is european admixture , there is also a clear semitic origin to the european jewry ( see [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ashkenazim#genetics ) ) 3 . 
  \u201e israeli '' is not synonimous with \u201e jew '' . 
  truth is that 20 % of israelis are arabs ergo , saying that \u201e israelis the most anti-semitic people on the planet '' is plain wrong , and is a cheap argument . 
  the israeli state might be treating palestinians like shit , and it might be \u201e xenofobic '' or \u201e anti-arab '' , but calling this \u201e antisemitism '' is incorrect .

  ... especially after eating beans . 
  why . 
  what happened ? 
  euronews might say that \u201e turkey denies the genocide happened '' . 
  euronews is not denying the genocide ever happened , while at the same time being balanced in its coverage . 
  you do n't have \u201e realistic expectations about technological progress . '' ? 
   there 's as many cars in bucharest as there are people as an example . 
  2 milion people , 1 milion cars .

  [ my eastern european reaction ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cb60k.gif ) ... 
   unfortunatly many does not consider this halal . 
  so , is there a debate inside the muslim community ? 
  disclaimer : i come from a culture that is used to animals ( [ usually pigs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig_slaughter#european_tradition ) ) being slaughterd with just a knife to the jugular , so i guess i have a different level of tolerance towards animal cruelty . 
  well , immigrants do tend to gather in one place as this gives them a social support network of like minded people close by in a foreign land . 
  it 's pragmatism initially , but it has the potential to lead to ghettoization . 
  with regards to your previous post :  i should have halal because it 's part of my tradition it does n't matter if it 's animal cruelty i do n't think it 's that cruel . 
  i think they should be allowed to slaughter the halal way all in all i agree with your post, 
   yeah they do that * here * where is that ? 
  i think these two articles might help with this discussion : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europeanism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_dream,
