  one of the major parties in the philipines , for example is a center-right mixed christian-democrat/muslim-democrat party ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lakas_kampi_cmd ) . 
  in a future integrated turkey , the akp will probably join the [ epp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) group of the the europarliament, 
  from my point of view , demographics is the second problem , after * \u201e the occupation of cyprus , kurdish conflict and armenian genocide are all issues that have not been solved and need to be , along with chronic issues of human rights and freedom of speech abuses . '' * ( as someone said [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/omnhy/on_turkeys_possible_accession_to_the_eu/ ) ) i think if the human rights record of turkey would be at \u201e a european level '' , people might not make that much of a fuss about demographics . 
  norway should join the eu . 
  i findthe penis on the euro coins completely unacceptable, 
  yeah . 
  some still consider them the same \u201e serbo-croatian '' language, 
  it 's not just demographics . 
  it 's also ideology . 
  the last 30 years have seen an upsurge in religious thinking in muslim countries . 
  it 's \u201e fashionable '' intellectually to be islamist nowadays , just as it was \u201e fashionable '' to be secular some decades earlier . 
  the whole intelectual zeitgeist has changed over the decades . 
  it 's not just demographics . 
  i personally think demographics do n't have that much an influence . 
  yep . 
  people generally have no religious problem with muslims from the balkans joining the eu ( albania , kosovo , bosnia ) . 
  they might invoke the fact that these are poor and underdeveloped countries , but i think i never heard somebody say albania should n't be in the eu because it 's mainly muslim, 
  from my point of view , the most pressing issues for turkey are points 4 & 5 :  4 \\ . 
  low gdp and education . 
  even though there is growth , it is relative . 
  the low level of gdp and lack of education along with demographics is something the union can not absorb . 
  the occupation of cyprus , kurdish conflict and armenian genocide are all issues that have not been solved and need to be . 
  this along with chronic issues of human rights and freedom of speech abuses . 
  it 's not about logic .

  thank you !, 
  oh , very interesting . 
  truth be told , when you said \u201e they '' i thought you meant the albanians , but still , interesting to hear other opinions beside the official one . 
  another question : why does vojvodina have autonomy , and extra minority rights ? 
  or more to the point , why are n't those minority rights extended to all of serbia ? 
  i ask because sometimes , romanians remember that the \u201e vlahs '' in timok do n't enjoy the same rights as the \u201e rumanians '' in vojvodina and some people get uppity about it . 
  also , how do you ( and other serbians ) feel about the possibility of serbia giving some albanian-speaking regions to kosovo ( presevo , bujenovac ) in exchange for ethnically-serbian northern kosovo ? 
  you should add a legend to it ( maybe make it a bit bigger ) and submit it to [ / r/mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn ), 
  not in romania :(, 
  interesting ... ps . 
  what do you mean by \u201e extra treatment '' ? 
   * navajo : * b\u00e9\u00e9sh bich ' ahii bik\u00e9yah ( `` metal cap-wearer land '' ) , in reference to stahlhelm-wearing german soldiers . 
  you 're doing a bad job falling into the serbian stereotype , 
  m\u0103 hazardez s\u0103 cred c\u0103 cifrele au sc\u0103zut de atunci ** english summary : ** latest polls : curent coalition 's voting intentions : ~ 25,6 % ; trust in the presidency : 15,6 % ; trust in the government : 12,3 % ( all figures were from before the current scandal ),

  it belongs to an american living in romania : http://kingofromania.com/ you probably wo n't decide to move here , but you might enjoy some of the stories here : http://kingofromania.com/2010/12/22/why-am-i-so-positive-about-romania/ http://kingofromania.com/2010/04/13/choo-choo-riding-the-rails-romania-style/, 
  no , your opinion is invalid for other reasons . 
   the only problem there is adopting the problems associated with the euro or staying with a currency pegged to the bank of england and having no control over inflation . 
  i think by the time scotland does become independent , the euro either would have kicked the proverbial bucket , or would have been saved and its current problems would have been overcome, 
  you 're romanian , are n't ya ? 
   for god 's sake why is everybody calling them roma ? 
  fucking call them gypsies . 
  the same reason that people call romanians \u201e romanians '' and not \u201e vlahs '' . 
  it 's what they call themselves , and what they want to be called by others . 
  inspired by a fellow euro-redditeur , who said he * \u201e [ would be all for introducing english as the second language across all european curricula , preferably from the lower grades ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/xs7fb/would_europe_be_better_off_with_a_common_language/c5pgyxi ) '' * i was curious how foreign languages are taught in your respective countries ( because romania kinda meets this above criteria ) . 
  ** how many foreign languages do you learn during 12 years of school ( plus college ) ? 
  ** when do you start the first language ? 
  what about the second one ( if it 's the case ) ** 3 . 
  ** which are the preferred languages ? 
  ** any other info regarding this subject you might find relevant ( like facilities for minorities to learn their respective languages and so on ) ? 
  ** ----- so i 'll start with * romania : * usually 2 ( foreign ) languages are taught , english almost always being the first , and then french or german being the the preferred second . 
  i 'm not sure , but i have a feeling french is more often the choice over german - given our [ francophilia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_international_organization_of_the_francophonie ) - , but this might be changing slowly . 
  usually , english starts in second grade , while language nr . 
  2 starts in grade 6 , and they go all the way to grade 12 . 
  given the fact that i attended a high-school class specialized on foreign languages , i also had the possibility of studying a third foreign language for one year , as an optional class ( in my case german , in the 11 grade ) . 
  people attending other specializations would not have this option . 
  after high-school , one also has 2 years of foreign language study in college ( the language depends ) other than this we also study some latin , but not that much ( a year or two , more if one attends a language high-school class ) . 
  we study this because , well , romanian is a romance language and all that jazz . 
  usually people do n't remember much from this course , aside from a few latin proverbs . 
  the minorities have additional \u201e maternal language '' classes . 
  actually , they study everything in their mother tongue , except languages , and romanian is just another foreign language they have to master . 
  for the older generation ( pre-1989 ) , the first language was russian , and the second one french . 
  few people studied english ( language of the capitalist-imperialist enemy ) . 
  so what about your country/provinde/land ? 
  ( i ask other romanians to correct me if i got something wrong ), 
  xenophobia , and those damned gypsies . 
  * a somewhat long text from a [ romanian paper ] ( http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/editoriale-opinii/articol/istoria-viitoarei-lovituri-stat-parlamentare-un-fel ) , but quite interesting , about the slow rise of the european parliament . 
  i hope you find it as interesting as i did . 
  sorry if the translation is not perfect * [ ... ] barroso is to withdraw ( as a third term is unprecedented ) , the post of commision president will be free . 
  reding is circulated as a possibility . 
  amongst the people 's party another possibility appears to be [ polish ] prime minister donald tusk . 
  socialists are circulating the name of the current president of the european parliament , martin schulz . 
  in the european parliament there are intense speculation and fierce negotiations . 
  wait a minute , take a break !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  what does the parliament have to do with the election of the commision president ? 
  in an article on euractiv.ro from 4 september [ ... ] : `` reding told euractiv that she thinks the commission president should be directly elected by the european parliament , representing all eu citizens '' . 
  so how does the parliament want to choose the commision president ? 
  well , sall i remind you how barroso was elected ? 
  the heads of state / government of the eu went into a room , they quarreled for about ten hours , blair and the guy from spain cornered chirac and finally they came out and said , dear europeans , this is commission president !, 
  yeah , pretty much as the pope is chosen . 
  the only difference is that instead of cardinals , here we have politicians elected by their people . 
  so what happened since barroso got appointed ? 
  how we end up discussing the election of the commission president by the parliament ? 
  it 's no small thing . 
  this is the very essence of a parliamentary system : there are elections , the party that wins propose a head of government and the parliament votes on him . 
  whether he 's called prime-minister as in the uk , or chancellor as in germany , he is elected by parliament after the elections and his power results from the parliamentary configuration given by the elections . 
  so what do reding and the others want : european elections in 2014 , the winning political group to nominate the head of the commission and parliament to vote on him . 
  that means that the eu will be a parliamentary system ? 
  when the hell did this happen ? 
  if you were to talk like in bucharest , this would be a true parliamentary coup : parliament is assuming powers that it has not been given by anyone . 
  yes , except that unlike in bucharest , it does so elegantly , slowly , patiently and with the constitution / treaties on the table .
