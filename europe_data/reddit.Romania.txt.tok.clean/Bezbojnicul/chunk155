  [ ... ] so , how does one choose the commission president ( pc ) ? 
  \u25cf 1958 - the treaty of rome established what was to become much later the eu . 
  pc is elected by the council unanimously , that is the heads of national governments . 
  so begins the tradition of papal elections for the pc . 
  [ ... ] indeed , it 's harder than the pope , here there is need for unanimity . 
  good , but what does the european parliament do ? 
  not much , as it 's a rather sad assembly , powerless ( not even named the pe then ) . 
  and so it stood for decades . 
  \u25cf 1979 - direct elections to the european parliament are introduced . 
  the people elect them . 
  now we have people with legitimacy that want some real power . 
  and here the parliamentary revolutions or coups begin ( parliamentary lovilutions [ a combination of the two ) . 
  that spans for decades and is likely to continue . 
  in more serious terms : the rise to the rank of true parliament . 
  and that is the first task of a true parliament in a parliamentary system ? 
  precisely to appoint the chief executive . 
  does the pe name the pc ? 
  far from it . 
  \u25cf 1993 - the maastricht treaty changed the procedure : pc is named by the council unanimously , but after consulting parliament . 
  just this ? 
  after 35 years of rome and 14 years after direct election , all parliament gets is consultation ? 
  outrageous , is n't it ? 
  so thought the meps as well : just consult us and that 's that ? 
  but national governments believed that they already gave them too much : we named the pc for decades , what do these guys want ? 
  some were downright annoyed : eu 's a union of states , we represent the states , we name the pc and that 's that . 
  come , sir , others reconciled them , it 's just a consultation and we hear them out , but do as we want . 
  so be it . 
  but what does `` consultation '' mean ? 
  and here comes one of those moments when meps put aside political differences and enter into the institutional war council . 
  they gathered and voted internal rules . 
  the result is the so-called `` rule 32 '' , saying bluntly : `` if the vote in parliament for the person nominated by the council is negative , the president ( of the parliament ) requires governments to withdraw the nomination and send another nomination . '', 
  let us discern . 
  therefore , the board proposes someone and then consults parliament . 
  in the council 's mind this consultation means nothing . 
  but by virtue of rule 32 it makes consultation of parliament a de facto veto : if we vote it negatively that you proposed to us , then you are required to nominate another . 
  the story set in motion a kind of miniwar , parliament postponed the voting of the eu budget [ ... ] . 
  as the european parliament always has more time and patience than the heads of government from the council , it usually wins wars of attrition . 
  so it also won this one . 
  \u25cf amsterdam treaty - it is clearly stated in writing that the person appointed by council as pc `` must be approved by parliament . '', 
  case closed : the consultation from maastricht became formally veto in the amsterdam treaty . 
  ah , and how much pleasure the parliament derived from the use of this new power . 
  how they tortured the poor barroso at his first appointment , they played the commissioners at the hearings , decades of parliamentary frustrations were seen there . 
  goood . 
  yet parliament does not nominate the pc . 
  national governments do and the pe only accepts ( or not ) . 
  so , it is only half a parliament in this matter , is n't it ? 
  yes , that 's right , you 're right . 
  but now we are seeing it : parliament started the institutional war to take the other half . 
  remember how after the maastricht treaty there were `` consultation '' and the ep used this to put its foot in the door and got a veto . 
  now we have another foot in the door . 
  \u25cf lisbon treaty - the procedure itself remains the same : council appoints , the ep approves it . 
  but we have an additional sentence : `` taking into account the outcome of the european elections and after appropiate consultations , the council nominates ... '' . 
  take a good look at that phrase . 
  it seems harmless , but actually it 's a huge foot in the door . 
  and beyond the door is the transformation of the eu into a parliamentary system . 
  so from 1958 onwards the council and only the council nomination . 
  how does it do it ? 
  however it wants . 
  in fact , as the heads of national governments want after they reach an understanding ( the treaty of nice since been dropped the need for unanimity and now we need a qualified majority , which has massively changed the dynamics of the decision of the board itself ) . 
  but lisbon has a little catch : nomination has to be made `` taking into account the outcome of the european elections . '', 
  what do you mean ? 
  well , the council says , sir , we consider them , you know , in general terms , but we still nominate on who we want . 
  nope , says the parliament , wait a minute : what europeans vote should be taken into consideration - right ? 
  and who are chosen by the europeans ? 
  we are , the parliament - right ? 
  so you have to appoint who we say , because we represent the results of the european elections - right ? 
  and what i say is not some gut feeling interpretation . 
  what i say is based on a ep motion . 
  immediately following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty , the ep passed a resolution that basically says how to interpret the treaty . 
  as they once consultation into a veto through rule 32 . 
  now , on may 7 2009 passed a little thing called absolutely boringly `` european parliament resolution on the impact of the lisbon treaty on eu institutional developments balance '' . 
  and what does the resolution say ? 
  that prior to designating the pc , the council must consult with the political groups in the ep and the european elections should be `` a key role '' in selecting the person appointed . 
  get it ? 
  that `` considering the election results '' of the treaty is `` an important role '' . 
  you propose who we tell you propose . 
  we do not know how the heads of government will react to this . 
  it seems they are stuck with each problems - the economic crisis , democratic problems in euro-banana republics etc. 
  perhaps they have not yet learned , but the european parliament has just stolen the plate with the decision to appoint the head of the eu government . 
  that 's why i love european parliament - that everyone undervalues it , but it almost always wins . 
  just like this , slowly and patiently . 
  ** tl ; dr ** * the european parliament is about to become the one who nominates the commision president turning the eu into a parliamentary system *, 
  so here 's [ that article ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hotnews.ro%2fstiri-esential-13523979-descoperire-arheologica-importanta-traseul-autostrazii-sibiu-orastie-cand-aparea-lumea-internationala-starni-furtuna.htm ) i mentioned earlier :  a ceramic piece engraved with unknown symbols , which could prove the existence writing in the early neolithic , was discovered by archaeologists on the site [ orastie-sibiu motorway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a1_motorway_ ( romania ) #or . c4 .83 . c8 .99 tie _ . e2 .80.93 _ sibiu ) , north of [ miercurea sibiului ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miercurea_sibiului ) , the director of the brukenthal national museum , sabin luca , announced on wednesday . 
  [ the ceramic fragment ] ( http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/1/1/1706/10268882/2/descoperire-arheologica.jpg?height=451&amp;width=600 ) , discovered in a residential complex dated before the year 6000 bc , could prove the existence of a writing system during this period and is , according to sabin luke , `` the only known fragment from that chronological moment , with such symbols . '', 
   `` i am shocked . 
  i organized i do not know how many symposiums , i published many volumes on international signs , symbols , seeking to deconstruct this idea that there had existed writing systems then . 
  i 've always said that there were communication systems that were not writing , but mere symbols . 
  i know not what to say as these are something ordered , variable symbols , and you realize it 's not an ornament . 
  it 's clear that it 's a system implementing something in a sequence with different types and will remain an occasion for dispute . 
  when it arrives on the international scene it will cause a storm '' said the director of the brukenthal national museum . 
   the housing complex that has been found is in the archaeological site called `` miercurea sibiului 2 '' , located north of the city of miercurea sibiului , on the garbovei valley and certifies to the first wave of neolitization in romania . 
  `` i had a chance to find another site of the first wave of neolitization of romania . 
  ( ... ) this is due to communities who came at that time from somewhere in macedonia , the closest analogies being discovered materials in serbian macedonia and greek macedonia , so northern greece . 
  it 's weird , but that is history . 
  scientifically speaking is a great discovery '' , said sabin luca . 
   archaeologists have explored three houses , with ovens and thousands of fragments of pottery , but it could be , according their calculations , another three to four houses of this period left unexplored nearby . 
  `` these findings show that these communities came rushing in with new technology such as neolithic agriculture , animal husbandry , another architecture , other social relationships , compared to the hunters that were here before and had ruled the area first - [ oltenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oltenia ) , [ banat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat ) and part of the western half of [ transylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ) '' , said sabin luca . 
   excavations were conducted at a depth of about five meters , during march-june this year . 
  [ ... ] on the miercurea sibiului 2 archaeological site a total of 29 of complexes with archaeological material were found , belonging to early neolithic - [ starcevo-cris culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star%c4%8devo%e2%80%93k%c5%91r%c3%b6s%e2%80%93cri%c5%9f_culture ) , the first iron age and early medieval period . 
  ** later edit ** : found an english language article : http://www.romania-insider.com/ceramic-piece-from-early-neolithic-found-in-romania-could-prove-existence-of-writing-8000-years-ago/68326/ and another discovery from two months ago , on the same motorway dig , but this one near the city of cristian : http://www.reddit.com/r/archaeology/comments/xxomo/discovery_of_8000_year_old_settlement_in_romania/  the oldest neolithic settlement in the country was found by archeologists in the fourth sector of the sibiu-orastie highway , near the town of cristian , sibiu county .
