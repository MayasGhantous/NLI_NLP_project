  the head of brukenthal museum , sabin luca , said the settlement was set up by the first wave of farmers who migrated from the near east . 
  [ ... ]  luca said the settlement was found four meters underground . 
  `` all the nine sites investigated produced exceptional archeological materials . 
  why is this site important ? 
  we found at this side a thing people think exists in theory , at least on romanian territory , and that is the first stage , the oldest stage , the oldest moment when the carriers of neolithic technologies appeared , the moment when , after a major climate change , people from the east , from anatolia , which were closest to us , began colonizing this area , which had a population of hunters and fishermen , '' luca explained . 
   among all the items found at the site , the most important are a mask , which could be the oldest in europe , and the oldest pot with two mouths . 
  luca also explained that the settlement was undisturbed and that nobody ever created a new settlement on top of it . 
  `` nobody lived on top of them for 8,000 years . 
  this is our great chance , '' he said .

  [ ... ] the battle for ukraine , which is being held between the eu and russia has reached its peak . 
  november 18th 2013 is the date by which the foreign ministers of the eu countries must decide whether or not they conclude an association agreement with ukraine , an agreement that will lead to an important rapprochement between the two regions . 
  meanwhile , russia is using all peaceful means ( for now ) to prevent this association , wishing that ukraine would become part of the eurasian union , putin 's imperialist project . 
  after just two decades of prospering in the gray area between europe and russia , leading politicians of today 's ukraine are negotiating though . 
  the air of government offices in kiev is extremely tense . 
  officials and politicians with whom i met pronounce words like `` classified information '' , `` last chance '' , `` retaliation '' . 
  at stake is more than the fate of a single country , `` failure to sign with the eu will have significant effects on how russia will behave with its neighboring countries , '' said a foreign diplomat in kiev . 
  russia appears obsessively in all discussions , along with the name of charismatic blonde yulia timoshenko , the former prime minister of ukraine . 
  tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison just months after losing elections against incumbent president viktor yanukovich , identified by the media as chief of the clan named `` the family '' . 
  seen from a distance , ukraine resembles a feudal state where many wealthy and corrupt landowners struggle trying to conserve power and access to the most important source of income : the country 's treasury . 
  here `` a typical gang war unfolds that has the whole country as its stage '' , says writer oksana zabuzhko . 
  ** why `` the family '' needs europe ** no one in `` the family '' particularly wants the european union , but they have no choice . 
  viktor yanukovich 's interests relate only to preserving its power and , consequently , of the group that coordinates with his son , oleksandr . 
  only the thing is that yanukovich will not win the 2015 presidential election ( he sits very badly in the polls ) , and the country is on the verge of a serious economic crisis . 
  to avoid this crisis , yanukovich needs cheap gas and cheap loans . 
  currently he can not get either one nor the other . 
  irritated by the stubbornness of ukraine , whose independence is for russia a `` betrayal in love '' ( aleksandr solzhenitsyn ) , moscow imposed on kiev a hefty price for gas . 
  the difference between the gas ukrainian buys from the russians and the one that it sells the population is subsidized from the budget . 
  just half of this difference , 4-5 % of gdp , is stolen by important people in the state , a businessman in kiev explained . 
  the state thus accumulated large debts to gazprom ( currently estimated at 882 million dollars ) and it can not issue bonds . 
  ukraine can not break its energy dependence on russia without starting to develop alternative energy resources and exploit shale gas . 
  but the energy ministry officials said that shale gas extraction will not start sooner than five years and that in an optimistic scenario , the peak will be reached only after a decade . 
  to overcome the crisis ukraine needs $ 15 billion , money that can not come exclusively from washington or moscow only . 
  kiev 's problem is that without a signed agreement with the europeans , it would be impossible to get a loan from the imf . 
  although the ministry of finance in kiev and now trying to get cheap loans in the international market , the prospects are `` not very positive '' admits an official of the presidential party . 
  ** policeman vladimir and repeat offender victor ** ` marry the highest bidder ' seems to be the logic of the family boss , viktor yanukovich , who had a meeting with vladimir putin a few hours last week . 
  `` yanukovich is still waiting for a concrete offer from russia '' , explained a political leader from kiev . 
  only , instead of offer , putin showed until now to yanukovich just the stick ( threats ) . 
  bad relationship between the two is notorious and generated by each one 's past . 
  if viktor yanukovych was sentenced for robbery in his youth , vladimir putin is a former kgb officer . 
  nobody knows how to conduct a negotiation between an ex-con and a former police officer , but in the political circles of kiev it is believed that putin would have already explained to yanukovich that signing with the europeans will create the context of his removal from power . 
  moreover , in the relationship with ukraine , russia is betting on fear : `` there are business people who tell me that russians would never forgive them if they approach the eu and that would be terrible . 
  it 's going to be awefull '' says a diplomat in kiev worried about possible economic and energy punishments of ukraine by russia . 
  ** blondie dilemma ** under threat of moscow 's stick , ukrainians look with some hope towards europe . 
  `` i asked if the european union in brussels will respond promptly if it happens to us the same thing that happened moldova 's wine exports when they were banned from russia , '' another official told me . 
  `` i have not received a direct response from them and i feel like the eu or the european commission will not try to react immediately . '', 
  only thing is that the europeans have put three conditions for signing the association agreement and , until today , none has been fulfilled . 
  among them the release of yulia timoshenko , the third condition , is the poisoned fruit which is at the hand of president yanukovych . 
  for ukrainians is hard to understand why europeans have conditioned the signing of an important agreement for the issue of a corrupt politician just like all the others who led ukraine in the recent years . 
  timoshenko was sentenced for signing the contract by which ukraine buys russian gas at a very high price . 
  european union however cites the incorrectnessof the trial , that timoshenko was closed because it is the most important electoral opponent of president yanukovych . 
  it probably matters that party yulia timoshenko is part of the epp as leading european politicians directly supports her release . 
  ** you europeans have done that !, 
  ** regardless of what camp one is comming from , in ukraine things are seen differently . 
  `` do not bind the future of this country to a corrupt lady , '' said a major figure in kiev , politically unaligned . 
  `` the issue is not whether yulia tymoshenko is guilty or not , but whether ukraine is ready to pay the price , '' says yuri miroshnichenko , president yanukovych 's representative in the the parliament of ukraine , commenting negotiations for the release of yulia timoshenko . 
  `` you made a symbol of selective justice from timoshenko and yanukovich into a star because now everyone wants to meet him and wants to know what he will do . 
  he 's the man of the hour '' notes journalist tetiana sylina . 
  `` you europeans have done that . '', 
  meanwhile , president yanukovich uses bureaucratic tricks to avoid the release and rehabilitation of yulia timoshenko . 
  neither current opposition leaders are very excited about rehabilitation , because that would mean an extra competitor in the the race for the 2015 presidential election . 
  the only ones who insist are europeans , but complete rehabilitation sentence seems to lose ground in the favor of pragmatic solutions of partial release of yulia timoshenko in order to undergo treatment in a clinic in berlin . 
  yanukovich negotiated however through tough soviet style . 
  he hopes he will sign the agreement without fully meeting any of the conditions set by the eu . 
  in fact , other ukrainians believe the same thing : `` the european union should sign the agreement without any condition . 
  even if tymoshenko remains in the jail '' says journalist tetiana sylina . 
  however , the dilemma of the blonde 's release hijacks attention from the other two conditions imposed by the eu , the reform of the electoral law and the reform of the prosecution , which are potentially more dangerous for ukrainian oligarchs and groups around the family . 
  yet both reforms are tangled up on the bureaucratic route somewhere in a country where everything can be resolved quickly after a phone president yanukovich . 
  ** russia lurking ** yanukovich , along with people `` the family '' consider the strategic interest of the europeans for ukraine is so great that the europeans will be willing to make any compromise in the end . 
  every foreign diplomat in kiev we spoke with say , however , otherwise . 
  a misunderstanding of which only russia will benefit . 
  a lurking russia using threats in kiev and trying to manipulate certain member states in brussels to vote against the deal . 
  `` it 's happened for a member state to vote against '' a european diplomat noted , and that would be enough to collapse the entire building . 
  `` the signing is probable , but not certain . 
  could be delayed until 2015 . '', 
  there are some european countries that are not especially interested in ukraine and try to manipulate the release of yulia timoshenko dilemma to hinder the process . 
  `` i can tell you which eu member states are against signing the agreement with ukraine , but then i 'd would have to kill you , '' said a senior official ukrainian mischievous smile . 
  the most important geopolitical battle of the year will take place these days right at the northern border of romania . 
  in one way or another , all countries in the region will be affected by the outcome . 
  if agreement between the eu and ukraine will not be signed now '' , says jorge zukoski , president of the american chamber of commerce in ukraine , `` in ten years , the members of the international community who were part of the negotiations will have a beer and cry on each others shoulder remembering the days in which they lost ukraine '' .
