  what 's public opinion like in your country ? 
  a lot of hu gypsy names soun roumanian ( like ` csorba ' & the secon one you mention ), 
  judging from what the british press writes : either `` wildlings '' or `` white walkers '' ... 
  i have never heard `` poc\u0103it '' being used for the reformed ( i 'm from oradea , and we have a healthy dose of both ) . 
  you might be thinking of baptists . 
  reformed are mainline protestants , like luthetans , except the former tend to be hungarians , while the later tend to be germans ( specifically transylvania saxons ) .

  hungary and greece . 
  i also have relatives in italy , but i have never met them . 
  brazilian portugurse more so than the european one imo ... 
  balkan is more than just ex-yu + albania ... 
  * coco * in romania . 
  quite slang though . 
  hence : [ crab mentality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crab_mentality ), 
  `` tractor-driver tan '' in our parts , 
  tbh , it is n't especially autonomous either , with the communist party watching everything ... 
  romania -  france ( 2015 ), 
  bucure\u0219ti - `` ora\u0219ul lui bucur '' , the city of bucur ( mythical shephard who supposedly founded the city ) . 
  boto\u0219ani - `` boston city '' ( heard from a native ) , tongue-in-cheek, 
  also `` ionescu \u015fi popescu '' as a sort of `` tom , dick and harry '' ... 
  `` pierre , paul et jacques '' is the french `` tom , dick and harry '' . 
  i 'm ethnically half romanian , half hungarian , and speak both languages ( raised bilingual ) , and identify as both . 
  in transylvania it 's not uncommon , and there is even a word for people like me : `` fele-fele '' ( hungarian for ` half-half ' ) . 
  i have other nationalities up my family tree ( italian , armenian , maybe greek ) but since they have no relevance today , they are more on the level of interesting family stories . 
  i do n't feel much connection to those cultures via family . 
  also * pan bagnat * in nice . 
  yummy ... 
  not very since ww2 . 
  my hometown used to be 1/4 jewish at one point , and the neologue synagogue is one of the dominant landmarks of our city center . 
  now there are way under 1 % , although the community is quite active ( google jews of orafea and ` hakeshet klezmer band ' ) . 
  one girl in our group of friends is jewish , but there really is n't anything that signals her ethnicity in any way my high-school principal was also jewish . 
  my hungarian-speaking grandpa still uses * v\u00e9ka * ( ` bushel ' ) for measuring grains ( no idea how much that is in metric ) . 
  also * m\u00e1zsa * ( in romanian * maj\u0103 * ) is still used as equivalent to 100 kg ( in imperial it used to be 100 pounds ) . 
  in romanian inches are still used for pipes ( * \u021bol * , from german ) and screen diameters ( * inci * , from english ) , although they are n't really from ` prior to conversion to metric ' . 
  in romania , digi24 is seen as the most neutral news channel . 
  not perfect , but in a different league from the rest . 
  emperor trajan and king decebal, 
  [ m\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/m\u0103r\u021bi\u0219or ) would be the most obvious one . 
  also new years eve gets mighty pagan-y with [ the goat going around ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=capra+anul+nou&amp;client=ms-android-asus&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ ), 
   * implying romania is slavic * them 's fighting words, 
  yeah , i had my share of shit comments/jokes about begging , prostitution and general ` anti-eastern-europeanism ' . 
  life goes on i guess . 
  the balkans were n't in the eu when they went apeshit . 
  we 're not conveniently ignoring anything , it 's you that does n't understand the argument . 
  when we speak of post-wwii peace we speak of the context of relations between eu members plus close allies such as ch and efta members . 
  yeah , although 99 % or gypsy words are colloquial/low prestige words . 
  i believe french works of arabic origin will also be integrated into yjis cathegory . 
  trust me , the feeling of weirdness can go both ways , 
  yeah , same in romanian . 
  in my area ( oradea ) , noticeable amounts of hungarian as well . 
  where my grandparents live ( tg . 
  mure\u0219 ) , the hungarian slang has plenty of romanian words as well . 
  ( [ my favourite example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx08agqhsmg ) ), 
  is n't `` bled '' also used used for ` home country ' ? 
  as in `` il est parti au bled . '' ? 
  also `` niquer '' - to fuck, 
  ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ case, 
  oh god ... 
  five : * romanian , hungarian , english , french , italian *, 
  the only connection that i could find is the fact that our countries share the same patron saint . 
  but i have a cute story from the city i now live in ( nice , france ) :  the nice cannon has been making tourists jump and pigeons soar with its noon blast for over 150 years . 
  it started in 1860 , when very punctual scotsman sir thomas coventry and his easily-distracted wife were living in nice . 
  having become increasing frustrated by his wife 's tardiness in presenting the noonday meal , he approached the mayor to propose a daily noon cannon shot just like back home in his scottish village , and offered to foot the bill . 
  some years later , sir coventry returned to scotland , taking his little cannon back with him , but by that time the locals were so used to their midday marker that they petitioned the city to continue the tradition , and it continues today .

  in my hometown of oradea , besides romanian , you hear hungarian daily , and romany as well , quite often . 
  it 's not uncommon to be greated billingually in shops ( `` pofti\u021bi / tess\u00e9k ! '' ) . 
  in my grandparents ' town of t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 hungarian is as widespread as romanian ( still romanian is the `` default '' ) . 
  i once witnessed a romanian busdriver talk to an old hungarian lady where both used their own language . 
  the more deep you go into the area known as szeklerland , the more dominant hungarian becomes ( although contrary to some myths , you can get by not knowing the language , and virtually all know some romanian save some old people ) .
