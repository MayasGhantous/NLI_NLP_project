  as always , the text agreed upon is something that can be read multiple ways , so some people can claim x and others can claim y , and not seem contradictory . 
  relevant part from the [ the rome declaration ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/03/25-rome-declaration/ ) signed today :  [ ... ] unity is both a necessity and our free choice . 
  taken individually , we would be side-lined by global dynamics . 
  standing together is our best chance to influence them , and to defend our common interests and values . 
  ** we will act together , at different paces and intensity where necessary , while moving in the same direction , as we have done in the past ** , in line with the treaties and keeping the door open to those who want to join later . [ ... ], 
  make of it what you will ... 
  my hometown of oradea has a flea market , open sunday and monday , sometimes saturday as well . 
  it 's called '' \u00d3cska '' by everyone ( sometimes spelled as `` ocico '' ) and it looks like this : * [ photo 1 ] ( http://cdn.ebihoreanul.ro/static/gallery_big/cumparatori-perdele-piata-vechituri-ocska-bihoreanul.jpg ) , [ photo 2 ] ( http://cdn1.bihon.ro/2013/07/5anticar-650x435.jpg ) and [ vice article ] ( https://www.vice.com/ro/article/targul-de-vechituri-din-oradea-e-un-cimitir-al-anilor-80-90 ) ( nsfw ) one of the coolest things though is the autumn fair in negreni , which is like a flea market on steroids . 
  [ vice article ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/romanian-fair-876 ) ( the text is kinda crap but but the photos are nice ) and [ another nice article ] ( https://madeintransylvania.wordpress.com/2012/06/11/negrehni-fair/ ), 
  the only thing i can think of is the tongue-twister * \u0218ase sa\u0219i \u00een \u0219ase saci * ( six saxons in six bags ) . 
  in my hometown in romania , maybe once a month ( there is an east african family that lives not far from where i used to live , and there are a few black students studying medicine ) . 
  where i now live ( france ) : daily , including at work . 
  * `` cartofi fran\u021buze\u0219ti '' * in romanian as well ... 
  yes . 
  people , of course , are pro increasing it ... 
  communism, 
  the only particularity with stickers like these is the abundance of [ greater hungary-shaped stickers ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ma/magyaridiot/image/renault4_s.jpg ) in hungary . 
  the idea that the genesis and constitutional / societal setup is in some ways markedly different ( implicitly in a positive way ) from the other countries on the planet . 
  while somewhat true in the late 18th century , it 's not really applicable today ( plenty of enlightenment-inspired republics , plenty of post-frontier societies , plenty of new world post colonial states out there ) . 
  to paraphrase a saying `` they are special , just like everyone else '' . 
   6 or 7 [ mpg ] just did the conversion . 
  holy shit , that 's ~ 33 to 39 litres per 100km . 
  [ cri\u0219ana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cri%c8%99ana_dialect ), 
  politicians will be politicians , but what i hate is the `` so what ? 
  others stole as well/at least he also did something '' excuses from the some people . 
  my aunt moved to budapest around ' 91 , so i heard my fair share ... 
  what about ` kajkavianising ' standard croatian ? 
  i hope to live to see this generalized in france ... 
  not a major difference , and not radically different , but i like this quirk from my area :  in some constructions , analytic forms are preferred to synthetic ones , e.g. 
  the preposition * c\u0103t\u0103 * ( `` towards '' , standard * c\u0103tre * ) is used instead of the dative : [ o z\u0268s \u02c8k\u0259t\u0259 \u02c8min\u02b2e ] ( `` he said to me '' , compare with standard * mi-a zis * ) . 
   it 's actually a popular joke that buzau and braila , the easternmost counties in wallachia , are in moldavia because ... well ... they speak that way ( a bit ) . 
  well it 's not wrong . 
  their manner of speaking is closer to moldavian dialects than the more southern ones . 
  otoh , brasov dialect sounds like `` southern light '' , although if i tell that to the locals they do n't like it ... 
  god , i hate the hungarian-hungarian use of definite articles with people 's names . 
  whenever i hear '' * a * sanyi '' or '' * a * laci '' i involuntarily take out my pocketknife ... 
  \u201e du-te \u0219i te-mpu\u0219c\u0103 ! '' - go shoot yourself !, 
  a more general `` fuck off '' would be \u201e plimb\u0103 ursu ' ! '' - go walk the bear !, 
  some more : * b\u00e9la iv the second homeland-founder ( rebuilt the country after the mongol invasion ) * andrew i the white / the catholic ( broke with his pagan supporters , restored christianity and declared pagan rites illegal ) * b\u00e9la ii the champion / the wisent ( earned during wars with germans ) * ladislaus the cuman ( his mother was the daughter of a chieftain of the pagan cumans who settled in hungary ) * vladislaus ii nicknamed vladislaus dob\u017ee ( he was polish and always approved the decisions of the royal council - `` dob\u017ee '' = `` very well '' ),

  architecture and urban planning, 
  have n't been to portugal , but i work ( in southern france ) with a great number of portuguese immigrants . 
  most are hard-working folks , and i enjoy working with them . 
  my boss is also portuguese , and he 's more on the sneaky side . 
  interestingly enough both types remind me of my fellow romanians . 
  we have many working class folks working on construction sites , and the `` work hard abroad , build house in home country '' - type is not unknown to me . 
  one interesting thing is that given that basically all the portuguese i work with come from the same area of northern portugal , they all look eerily similar they all have more or less the same height ( lower than average french ) , and many look like they might be distant cousins to each other . 
  there is a slight `` clone army '' vibe in the air  . 
  also home-made porto wine is good stuff man ... 
  ** tatars ** - as a historic minority from dobrudja , i never really heard anyone say anything bad about them . 
  they are cool , and people like them . 
  ** albanians ** - we have a small historic minority , but the image of albanians is mostly shaped by that of albanian emigrants in the west ( so criminality is part of the image ) as well as by the recent events in `` yugoslavia '' ( and since we have a good opinion of serbs , and our own anxieties about the hungarian minority , we tend to view albanian armed struggle in the balkans negatively ) . 
  ** bosnians ** - most people just view them as * [ trigger warning !, 
  ] * muslim serbs more or less , so the image is largely neutral/slightly positive . 
  sanda marin 's `` carte de bucate '' ( ` cookbook ' ) , or as we call it `` the sanda marin '' . 
  it 's every self-respecting romanian housewife 's cooking bible . 
  the amazon description of [ the english version ] ( https://www.amazon.com/sanda-marins-traditional-romanian-cooking/dp/0967169208 ) :  from the carpatian mountains comes the most comprehensive collection of traditional romanian recipes . 
  this 516-page book , with colored illustrations , offers bilingual titles and search index and metric and english units for 1,296 recipes translated and adapted from the 1966 edition of the most favorite romanian cookbook . 
  one area that could be our `` coal belt '' is the [ jiu valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jiu_valley ) , a mining valley . 
  another settlement that had a strong reputation back in the day was [ cop\u0219a mic\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cop%c8%99a_mic%c4%83 ) , a settlement famous for it 's pollution . 
  as for de-industrialisation , most major and mid-sized cities had factories built by the communist regime that went bust after 1989 . 
  same overall family , but different subfamily . 
  like english and farsi , for example . 
  hungarian . 
  cause i speak it ... 
  do you have an example ? 
   ) that song by mahala rai banda is not in romanian , but in romany ( the indo-iranian language of the roma ) . 
  here in nice , most boulangeries seem to be usually staffed by maghrebis . 
  otoh , my corner store seems to be indian owned ( although it 's pretty exceptional from what i 've seen ) . 
  erik marchand & taraf de caransebe\u0219 - ' [ marv eo ma mestrez ] ( https://youtu.be/ku6vab6rzdq ) ' ( ` my beloved is dead ' ) [ breton ], 
  my dad was from southern romania and he learnt to speak the language in his early 20 's ... 
   how did romania retain its latin heritage while being surrounded by slavic peoples ? 
  it retained its `` latin * language * '' but culturally - if that 's what you mean by ` heritage ' - it 's very much balkan . 
  i 'd say the closest countries culturally are bulgarians and serbs , both slavic countries . 
  yes , it 's the law . 
  it is relative , but there are states where minority individuals identify more with their ethnic group than with their citizenship , and this might impact social and political dinamics , so it is a relevant factor to be known . 
  i admire french egalitarian approach , but it has both upsides and downsides . 
  made up or rare/unusual ethicities go into the ` other ' category in romania . 
  our census collects ` ethnic group ' , ` mother tongue ' and ` religion ' . 
  we do n't ask for ` race ' , since we do n't have many racial minorities . 
  some ethnicities ( the ` historic ones ' - see table in [ this article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/minorities_of_romania ) ) already have predetermined codes for the census , the rest are grouped as ` other ' . 
  as a side-note , our minorities would be up in arms if the state would cease collecting ethnic data . 
  it would be seen as a move towards trying to claim that `` there are no minorities '' / `` everybody is romanian '' . 
  for the hungarian minority , for example , ethnic identity is more important than citizenship . 
  the best advice i got was '' * s * / * z * pronounced with the tongue between the teeth '', 
  deutsche welle 's `` inside europe '' is a nice current events podcast which , while not focused on culture per se , can give you glimpses into european culture . 
  plus al the entertaining drama that goes with it . 
  ( yes , i 'm enjoying this election season ), 
  i intrpreted the question to mean the current constitution . 
  for the local stuff : * [ ebihoreanul ] ( http://www.ebihoreanul.ro ) * [ nice-matin ] ( http://www.nicematin.com ), 
  nice also has an anthem - [ nissa la bella ] ( https://youtu.be/15ozvztsyyw ) . 
  it was played a lot here on the radio after the july terrorist attack . 
  the ethnic hungarian area of [ szeklerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz\u00e9kely_land ) has an unofficial anthem , which is usually sung , afaik , at the yearly pilgrimage in the \u0218umuleu-ciuc , or as the anthem of the miercurea ciuc ice hockey team . 
  * [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/jczxwzt-5ey ) ( turn captions on for english lyrics ) this is the only one i can think of , and even this is unofficial . 
  romania : it 's from 1991 , with some revisions being made around 2003 . 
  regret ? 
  hell no !, 
  emigrating from romania to france was one of the best and most enriching decisions of my life .
