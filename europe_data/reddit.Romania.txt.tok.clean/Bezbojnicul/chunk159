  i finally feel like there is more to life than hopeless struggle . 
  i do miss certain things though : * speaking hungarian ( it 's the one language i use least here ) * drinking beer at the pub . 
  france has an amazing wine culture and wine diversity , but southern france is n't exactly your most in tune area with beer . 
  luckily we did find a more belgian-ish pub in the neighbourhood , so that counts . 
  * on a similar note , oddly enough , since i went to southern france for the weather , i sometimes miss the small week-long rain from back home . 
  you know , the one that makes you cosy up in a pub . 
  here all rain has a `` summer rain '' feeling to it . 
  * the food from back home . 
  some things just are n't the same , and even making the dishes here is n't the same , as some ingredients are hard to find , and some are a we bit different . 
  being close to the france-italy border , and thus having acces to both countries culinary culture and products , sure makes up for it . 
  * family . 
  and most of all i miss my sister . 
  it 's hard being far away from family . 
  * my maybe one regret is not going to my grandma 's funeral . 
  it was at the moment we were most financially strained ( i found a job the next month , after 6 months of searching ) , so i took the decision not to go . 
  yeah , the difficulty in conversation is the hardest thing . 
  * in varietate shitpostia *, 
  one is more different than the other though ... 
  in some parts of romania , that became * cocioanye * , designating the same food . 
  why is that not a thing in romania ? 
  jesus , some people ... 
  pretty much the same in romania . 
  we dismantled most of our communist factories , so that had a nice , `` green '' side-effect ... 
  even 2 meps is enough imo . 
  they are 33k versus malta 's ( least populous member ) 420k . 
   keep silent in greek do n't think that 's possible , 
  romanian : daily with my wife french : daily with coworkers and strangers ( i live in france ) italian : at least once a week , sometimes as often as daily ( have italian friens and coworkers ) hungarian : whenever i phone my grandpa , and sometimes when i talk to my mom . 
  english : whenever i am abroad , with english-speakers or when tourists ask for directions . 
  bussines or pleasure ? 
  west and south : tangier , morocco ( 35 \u00b0 46 \u2032 n 5 \u00b0 48 \u2032 w ) north : amsterdam , netherlands ( 52 \u00b0 22 \u2032 n ) east : alanya , turkey ( 32 \u00b0 00 \u2032 e ), 
  are you asking about euro * vision * ? 
  once month , give or take . 
  i live near the franco-italian border . 
  there is still anti-semitism , but most of it is the `` omg grandpa said something cringey '' rather than the politically charged vitriolic type . 
  wife is dental technician , says \u00fcber-white teeth implants are ordered by the less educated , who might end up with 1-2 false pearly whites among a collection of more yellowish ( i.e. 
  natural ) teeth . 
  well , the corsicans cared , since they kinda rebelled ( see : fnlc ) . 
  for the orthodox , easter  christmas, 
  two sz\u00e9kelys visit bra\u0219ov right after it was renamed ora\u0219ul stalin ( * stalin city in romanian * ) by the commies . 
  - j\u00e1nos , that 's why the [ red army used to steal wrist-watches ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/red_army_soldiers_raising_the_soviet_flag_on_the_roof_of_the_reichstag_with_two_watchs.jpg ) , * mert stalin is \u00f3r\u00e1s volt * ( because stalin was himself a watchmaker ) . 
  -- the joke is that the hungarian * \u00f3r\u00e1s * ( watchmaker ) sounds like romanian * ora\u0219 * ( city ) . 
  it basically requires you to be familiar with hungarian , romanian and the history/geography of romania . 
  i think he means the pm ( the question seems focused a bit on the parliamentary system ) . 
  since we had elections recently , the outgoing pm does n't represent a constituency since he 's a technocrat ( he used to be agriculture comissioner of the eu ) , and we do n't know who the next pm will be . 
  * romanian * - from paternal side of the family , as well as from school and life in general . 
  * hungarian * ( somewhat dialectal ) - from maternal side of the family . 
  * english * - from school ( 1 ^ st foreign language ) + watching all those undubbed cartoons . 
  * french * - from school ( 2 ^ nd foreign language , so way less emphasis compared to english ) , as well as from moving to france a year ago * italian * - from watching italian cartoons during childhood and from interacting now with italians in france . 
  i also had latin in school , as well as a year of german , but not much stuck . 
  it 's bs because it 's an oversimplification . 
  i explained why in another comment . 
  it has also been debunked multiple times on / r/linguistics, 
  well , then you have to split transylvania et al. 
  into `` romanian areas '' and `` hungarian areas '' , given that thete are some sensible cultural differences between those two as well . 
  `` closest to latin '' is bs . 
  `` closest language to latin '' is a major oversimplification that is a one way street to / r/badlinguistics sardinian is conservative in some ways ( phonetics ) , romanian in others ( noun cases , neuter ) , and both have diverged from latin in their own way . 
  romania : * transylvania ( center + west ) vs regat ( south + east ), 
  we used to sing the anthem each morning in elementary ( ' 92 - ' 96 ) . 
  do n't know if it was school policy or if it was just our teacher who could n't shake of her commie reflexes . 
  sometimes i see someone and thete is this eery familiarity about his looks/facial features . 
  9 out of 10 i hear him speak romanian a minute after . 
  i 'm an atheist and do 2 easters a year . 
  in romanian it 's '' * salat\u0103 de boef * '' , which makes no sense , since it 's not made with beef , but poultry . 
   with a little research i found out that it 's a croatian version of dobos torte in the style of zserbo , without the caramel on top . 
  dobo\u0219 would have been my second guess , but it was missing the caramel on top , 
  also , since about 2004 , * panettone * has kinda become widespread around christmas , thanks to our diaspora in italy ( i remember that bringing * panettone * as a christmas gift was all the rage about a decade ago ) . 
  which itself comes from `` bis - '' * twice * and `` cotti '' * baked * . 
  like ` biscuits ' . 
   - ma\u0111arica - judging by its name , it should originally be from hungary , but i do n't know if it really is looks like [ zserb\u00f3 ] ( http://www.mindmegette.hu/karacsonyi-zserbo-szelet.recept ) . 
  the link itself says `` christmas zserb\u00f3 recipes '' . 
  [ apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caf%c3%a9_gerbeaud ) it 's named after a guy from geneva called emil gerbaud  - orehnja\u010da / makovnja\u010da - roll with walnuts/poppy seeds looks like * beigli * , 
  if you decide to go to sevillia , pm and i will recomend some awesome restaurants/tapas bars . 
  proposed to my wife in sevillia , so yeah . 
  there is romance there . 
  yes . 
  people in nice go to ventimiglia to shop . 
  when i was young , people in oradea used to shop in debrecen . 
  * mecdonalds * , * mec * for short, 
  an article with lots of pictures of what my homrtown of oradea has to offer : https://citybreaksaaa.com/2015/06/21/oradea-lart-nouveau-voile-et-devoile/amp/ ( i.e. 
  lots of hungarian sezession ), 
  would work even better with lusatia . 
  the idea is that people do n't associate roma with us passports , not that americans ca n't be roma . 
  it was a statement about the border guard 's perception ( and inherent biases ) . 
  europeans smile less than americans 2 . 
  customs officers smile even less . 
  some look mean to see how you react . 
  nobody thought you were roma , given you handed him a us passport 4 . 
  he probably knows what a muslim looks like , given there are quite a few in europe 5 . 
  you speculate , but truth is you have no idea why he was grumpy . 
  maybe his wife left him a day before 6 . 
  if it was xenophobia ( which we have no way of knowing if it was ) , it could also have been general anti-americanism , not necessarily racism 7 . 
  from the comments here , you generally come across as someone not particularly likeable . 
  maybe it was n't your colour , but your attitude ? 
  30 y.o. 
  m , married since 2014 . 
  after 9 years we made it official , cause i felt introducing her as `` my wife '' is more appropriate . 
  til we do : [ come with me to oradea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wzmjieaehy ), 
  also , we have cathegories for mixed race people . 
  children born from an african parent and a romanian parent are usually called `` mulatrii '' , and are often considere a different cathegory from `` negrii '' ( , ` blacks ' , i.e. 
  ` africans ' ) .
