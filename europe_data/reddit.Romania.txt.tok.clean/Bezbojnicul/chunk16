  - unpr is a collection of various defectors used by the president to create a parliamentary majority back in the day , but who turned against him * pnl in government until recently together with psd . 
  center-right ( liberal-conservative ) . 
  one of the so called \u201e historical parties '' ( because it was refounded in 1990 as the heir of the pnl from the interbellum ) . 
  i do n't like the current leader . 
  * pdl is the presidential party . 
  former communists turned from center-left to center-right some 10 years ago . 
  they governed before psd , introduced austerity measures and are hated for it . 
  * pmp second presidential party , made up of some people from pdl . 
  ( there were 4 parties affiliated with the president in the race ) . 
  party boss is elena udrea , shady businesswoman . 
  president 's daughter ( former mep ) also member * udmr and mircea diaconu - see above * disclaimers : * ideology not that important to said parties on the national level ( they seem more coherent on the eu level ) , and shady businessmen present in all of them . 
  i stickied it in the hopes of turning into a \u201e results thread '' but then i made another thread and stickied that instead . 
  sorry for confusion . 
  germany results in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/26ga2y/projected_results_of_the_european_election_in/ ), 
  10 minute until polls close and exit-polls can be published . 
  biggest party is expected to be psd ( s&d ) with around 40 % , then the liberals at 15-20 % . 
  will return with more exact numbers after exitpolls .

  he was initially barred from running because he had been found incompatible by the national integrity agency , but the court later overturned the ban . 
  * udmr is the hungarian minority party * greater romania party ( far-right ) , which had 3 seats in the 2009 elections did not make the threshold . 
   i guess because we always have elections on a day when most people are working :-) well , we have it on sundays , and still we close polls at 21:00 . 
  all these early poll closings have confused me as well . 
  inkscape . 
  ( free vector graphics editor ) i get . svg maps of wikimedia commons and adapt them to fit my need . 
  well , one way of looking at it is that 85 % of the people 's will was that they do n't give a fuck either way and accept whatever other decide . 
  exist polls ? 
  is voting over , or are they partial exit polls ? 
   independents stand at 27 % combined , i think that 's the important part and it was n't even mentioned . 
  interesting . 
  how come they score so high ? 
  better try / r/askeurope instead of here . 
  you might get more answers there . 
   using that proof , they will go legally after the republic . 
  good !, 
  i also think brussels should bitchslap the cypriot authorities to hell for this . 
   the minister was n't there to talk to the protesters , of course , but rather to attack them . 
  `` i ca n't discuss with mouthy women '' jesus christ that 's sexist as fuck ... 
  what 's interesting is that romania seems to be increasing compared to the previous euroelection . 
  added to my list of `` ep election maps and visualizations '' . 
  next week will be fun in this regard , 
   it 's disappointing to see czech republic and slovakia at 20 % and latvia at 30 % turnout . 
  it ca n't help the perception of the eu parliament . 
  i think these numbers should also be weighed against national election turnouts , to see it they are abnormal , or part of a more general apathy . 
  ^ ^ idea : ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ i ^ ^ should ^ ^ make ^ ^ a ^ ^ map ^ ^ about ^ ^ it ... 
  i want that too . 
  how ? 
   if he was french or spanish and would have made that ad in france or spain nobody would even blink . 
  that 's because nobody fears a french or spain-dominated eu . 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  this is one of the stupidest things he could have done . 
  local , national and european levels at least ... 
  yes for netherlands , no for uk, 
   there are lots of americans around brasov visiting bran , rasnov , sinaia probably sibiu and sighi\u015foara also have a more international crowd when it comes to tourists . 
   you also forgot bulgarians . 
  there are lots of bulgarian tourists coming here . 
  i was n't aware tbh . 
  good to hear !, 
  mostly hungarians , and then germans . 
  mostly because transylvania used to belong to austria-hungary , and [ ethnic germans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germans_of_romania ) , and especially [ the saxons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons ) , also played an important role in its history . 
  i live [ in western romania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradea ) . 
  same here . 
  to us it 's just another election , albeit one which we do not fully understand . 
  i understand , and i 'm not looking to push any buttons , but pre-independence ireland was part of the uk , and they did fall under the `` brit '' name , to outsiders at least ( although i 'm sure there were some irish who did identify as brits ) . 
  i apologize if i offended anybody . 
  i was thinking in terms of pre-independence , so i could draw a better paralel with today 's spain/catalonia . 
  both . 
   yet , south ireland has no culture given that the irish are roman catholic , while the ~ ~ rest of the ~ ~ brits are mostly protestant is a big cultural rift between the two . 
   original thread then post there to debunk the thread , not make another thread about it . 
  ( fyi , at the moment the deal was n't reached , they reached it later . 
  see title and subsequent conversation [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/263qej/china_to_delay_russia_gas_deal_in_blow_to_putin/ ) ), 
  / r/europecirclejerk is fine too, 
  did n't it turn out that the metro trains were ok after all ? 
  there is a somewhat well established color pallete for europarty group colors used in graphs . 
  s&d in dark blue ? 
  why ?? 
  he might mean [ akrotiri and dhekelia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ), 
  awesome vid . 
  both this and the other one, 
  for those who missed it : [ video link inside ] ( http://programm.daserste.de/pages/programm/detail.aspx?id=d5e15cdefbf3b78b560307608a9caecc ) ps . 
  updated the index as well, 
   guess it 's too hard to teach journalists the difference between racism and xenophobia . 
  tbh , the two words have become synonymous in the english language . 
  keep it the relevant thread, 
  and why does czechia take 2 days to vote ? 
  czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible . 
  it makes very little effort to speak the other language . 
  english is taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice . 
  romanian , hungarian , english , french and a wee bit of italian . 
  and did n't the austrians also like this new identity to some extent because it made them victims of the nazis , rather than perpetrators , like the germans ? 
   you can also find plenty of information , for example all the debates via [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25gogo/meta_index_of_eu_candidate_debates/ ), 
  subs would be awesome . 
  i wonder if there is a way to get transcripts of the english version ? 
  do n't worry . 
  soon we 'll start lamenting that europe functions behind our backs and has no democratic legitimacy ... 
  she seemed even more so than in the first two debates tbh . 
  i think campaign fatigue is setting in . 
  verhofstadt seemed a bit off at times as well .
