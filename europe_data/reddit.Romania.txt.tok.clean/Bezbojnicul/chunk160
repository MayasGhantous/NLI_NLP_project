  i also heard `` metis '' as a cathegory for asian/euro mix , but have n't heard it being used in conversations . 
  well , hawaii is n't in the americas either ... 
  and he formed a governing coalition supported by the majority of meps . 
  and the actual `` head of state '' , i 'd argue , is collective , being the council itself ( the one made up of the national heads of state/gov ` t ) . 
  not really . 
  english might be widespread online , and it might be the default lingua franca with foreigners , but virtually everyone knows romanian in romania ( even if it 's not the mother tongue of some people ) , so the default assumption is you can use romanian always . 
  english is for speaking abroad or with foreign visitors . 
  romanian has a long history of absorbing foreign words and influences . 
  today it 's english , in 1860-1940 it was french and to a lesser degree italian , before that it was turkish and greek , and in the dark ages it was slavic and to a lesser degree hungarian . 
  colloquial romanian also contains many romany ( gypsy ) loans . 
  it might be fashionable to code-switch in `` romenglish '' in some circles ( high-schoolers , corporate yuppies ) , and that might piss off purists and pedants , but outside of those contexts romanian is pretty much as strong as it ever was . 
  there is no actual competition between the two languages because they are seen as serving different functions . 
  ural mountains =  ural river =  caspian sea =  caucasus mountains =  black sea =  bosphorus =  marmara sea =  dardanelles =  mediterranean sea =  strait of gibraltar, 
  from what i see , georgia seems quite similar culturally to romania . 
  orthodoxy , byzantine-ottoman cultural influence , a lot of sheep , grapes and so on ... they have that balkan/eastern europe mixed vibe about them that is just too familiar . 
   people responded with : it 's too popular and everyone does it . 
  wow ... 
  [ tartiflette with reblonchon cheese ] ( https://www.meilleurduchef.com/cgi/mdc/l/en/recipe/tartiflette-recipe.html ) . 
  might add some leftover asiago and some other bits of cheeses i have in the fridge . 
  what i like about him is he 's very presidential . 
  a bit paternal , but not insufferable . 
  also , i like the fact that he 's not le pen . 
  sarko and his friends ( like estrosi , ciotti ) , otoh , are amazingly insufferable . 
  in my hometown of oradea , romanian , hungarian and romany ( gypsy ) can be regularly heard in the street . 
  i do n't know . 
  some people say it is commie legacy , some it is n't . 
  the diffrence is that hungarians always use eastern name order , while romanians only do so when they want to sound official ( ` popescu ion ' is the `` bureaucratic order '' ) while in normal speach , western name order is used ( ` ion popescu ' ) . 
   the main deficit is in people paying attention . 
  and the media ...

  [ la brigue et tende ] ( http://images.slideplayer.fr/1/10878/slides/slide_7.jpg ) ( 06 ) were annexed in 1947 . 
  almost 1 million romanians migrated to spain since the 00 's ( much more than to the uk , for example ) , yet there was little to no hysteria surrounding them ... 
  bagged milk used to be the norm in romania in the '90s - early ' 00s . 
  nope , not really . 
  yes . 
  december 1 ^ st involves military parades . 
  it 's big , and people care . 
  especially in bucharest . 
   why u did this romania :( ( ( ( ( payback for being cooler than us before 1989 !, 
  we call it `` ca\u0219caval pan\u00e9 '' . 
  one thing that i found to be very specific to our area is using the herb ' [ lovage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovage ) ' ( leu\u0219tean ) . 
  i think bulgarians and hungarians also use it but that 's probably it . 
  another romania-specific thing is [ bor\u0219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bor%c8%99_ ( bran \\ ) ) . 
  on a more local level , i really missed my hometown 's [ potato flatbread ] ( http://www.reteteculinare.ro/assets/files/recipe/804/fdb_1475476641_placinte_cu_cartofi_si_varza_murata_6993_804.jpg ) ( with sour cream , telemea and [ mujdei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mujdei ) ) when i went to college , 160 km to the east . 
  it 's very local and delicious . 
  also , i was surprised to find out the french do n't use parsley roots in cooking , only parsnip . 
  my folks have had remoulade sauce in the fridge al the time for at least a decade . 
  it 's not very well known , but you can find it in hypemarkets . 
  ajvar looks pretty close to our `` zacusc\u0103 '', 
  we usually bought some forints before we went across the border , and whatever we had left at the end we kept for next time . 
  ( so yeah , having some forints around the house was n't unusual ) . 
  yep , it 's oradea  what 's the context of your visit ? 
  bussines or pleasure ? 
  using the geopolitical term is very much relevant here . 
  eastern europe never had the discussion about racism and the far-right , that the west had . 
  also , virtually no immigrants . 
  my hometown in romania is 10km from the hungarian border . 
  crossing to the nearest city ( to go to the mall there , or buy this or that ) is not unusual at all . 
  i now live in france , 30km from the italian border . 
  we buy groceries in the nearest italian town about once a month . 
  also , more colloquially , and mostly about other people 's gf/bf :  ( m ) gagiu  ( f ) gagic\u0103, 
  i do n't think that a hungarian autonomous region in szeklerland is the end of the world , nor is it necessarily the first step towards secession . 
  it could in fact calm the region down ( a la south tyrol ) . 
  furthermore , even if it did end up declaring independence , the transition could be very smooth , given eu and schengen membership , and would be beneficial to romania in the long run ( the hungarian minority would drop under the 5 % electoral threshold , so they would become less relevant politically ) . 
  [ the media ] ( http://m.origo.hu/tudomany/20151029-europa-jupiter-hold-ocean.html ) seems to use ` europa ' though ... 
  basically the psd candidate in 2004 and 2014 presidentials made a lot of young people go `` if he wins i 'll emigrate ! '' . 
  during the 2nd round of the 2004 there was a poem that went around via sms to get young people to vote against the psd candidate ( adrian n\u0103stase aka `` bombo '' ) , higely corrupt , and very close to winning . 
  ** in english ** being :  and if branches hit the windows * [ first line of a famous poem ] *  and you vote with bombo ,  i 'll stick my dick in the people  and emigrate to congo ( since the `` emigrating to congo '' is sort of our expression encompassing the same feeling ), 
  you could reserch how national media focuses on eu related stuff in various countries . 
  like the eu elections , comissioner appointments and so on . 
  french ( daily ) and italian ( ~ weekly ) .

  what we have is by no means a `` huge separatist movement '' . 
  germany allows dual german-othereu citizenship . 
  `` un de\u021b de p\u0103linc\u0103 '' is the only context in which decilitre is used in romania , and only regionally , 
  you can tell the general area ( scandinavia , central europe , iberia , etc ) sometimes . 
  ** geopolitically ** : everything that was communist pre 1989 ( warsaw pact + yugoslavia + albania ) ** culturally ** : russia , ukraine , belaris , probably moldova as well romania is eastern geopolitically , but balkan ( south east european ) culturally . 
  was ' t there a short-lived united `` central america '' as well ? 
  do n't know about the rest of france , but there seems to be a noticeable brazilian community in nice and thereabouts . 
  djingis kek, 
  i 've noticed it comes in waves , but one recurring things seems to be that it gets far-right-y on friday and saturday nights . 
  i guess the moderates are out socializing and having a social life . 
  of course i have . 
  but in france , where i now live , it seems impossible to find ( they only use parsnip ) . 
  ` cant ' means `` narrow side '' ( and comes from german ) . 
  '' [ curb ] ( http://www.pavajesatumare.ro/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bordura2.jpg ) '' is called ` bordur\u0103 ' . 
  what made you think it 's ` cant ' ? 
  romanian for `` i 'll do it ! '', 
  is '' * fac eu !, 
  * '' which can end up sounding very close to `` fuck you ! '', 
  there is an archeological site in corsica called `` cucuruzzu / capula '' . 
  first word reads like regionalism for `` corn '' the second like `` like [ the ] dick '' , which is an expression meaning `` of bad quality '' , like the english `` shitty '' . 
  so read out , the site translates something like `` shitty corn '' said by some country bumpkin . 
  the root more than the leavestalk . 
  the leavestalk is somewhat of a novelty . 
  otoh you do n't eat the root of the parsley ... 
  so does romania ... 
  nice , france .
