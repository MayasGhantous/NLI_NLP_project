  we used to write with cyrillic and switched to latin mid-19 ^ th century . 
  it would be cool if we re-adopted the mongrel [ transitional alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_cyrillic_alphabet#unregulated_transitional_alphabets ) . 
  it would make us unique , and be an interesting reflection of our culture . 
  afaik , to claim asylum you need to be `` in country x '' , but if you have n't gone through the ` border checkpoint ' you are n't , you 're still in international territory , ( and [ with a syrian passport ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/visa_requirements_for_syrian_citizens.png/800px-visa_requirements_for_syrian_citizens.png ) there is little chance of passing ` the border ' ) . 
  corporate-speach is called rominglish here . 
  romanian is a language full of lonwoards that just continues assimilating everything . 
  now it 's mostly english , before it used to be french and some italian , before that turkish and greek and slavic . 
  the words get adapted to the phonetics and grammar of romanian . 
  spelling varies . 
  some enter with their native form and later get a romanian spelling , some keep the original spelling , some get stuck halfway .

  he 's awesome . 
  creuze de ma and buona novella are absolutely wonderfull albums ... 
  just looked . 
  it 's not the app . 
  maybe it 's their site . 
  i know i 've seen francs being displayed still . 
  no , it 's a default feature . 
  i mean , it 's only a years since i came to france , so it 's not like i have it since 2002 ... 
  i think my bank app still displays french francs alongside euro . 
  yeah , was browsing to see the examples of ` foreign-to-latvian ' translations , and it popped out . 
   * eminesku * not in a million years would i have expected to find [ that name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihai_eminescu ) there ... 
  man , you went straight to the jugular ... 
  yeah , i 'm sure there are loopholes and stuff . 
  human nature after all . 
  still was a funny situation , 
  i once had a piss-drunk saudi try to explain how islam was the truest religion ... 
  romania 1 . 
  the child takes the family name of the parents if it 's the same , or if not the parents decide on whose name the child takes ( i think the posibilities are : mother 's , father 's or of both hyphenated ) 2 . 
  family name is not declined by gender . 
  i know women of bulgarian and russian ( lipovan ) origin , and their family name is in the male form . 
  restrictions : you can not give names that are `` ridiculous or insulting '' , but very few fall into this category ( think `` bin laden '' or `` hitler '' or `` refrigerator '' as given names ) 4 . 
  the law states that names are written `` in the mother tongue , using the latin alphabet '' . 
  in principle this means that any diacritic is allowed , but in practice it varies a lot . 
  if your name is erd\u00e9ly\u00ed alad\u00e1r \u00d6d\u00f6n ( and thus ethnic hungarian ) , it might end up being written erdelyi aladar odon in some documents if the clerk is unfamiliar with hungarian names/letters . 
  but it 's not really a big problem ( there has been no controversy around it ) as non-romanian diacritics are kinda optional , and those who are familiar with them ( let 's say other hungarians ) know when to mentally put them back . 
  in practice , even romanian names tend not to be declined : genitive form `` of mary '' can be declined `` a mariei '' or the alternative `` a lui maria '' which does n't modify the name itself and in everyday speech , people use the latter , so there is no pressing need to have the names fit a certain mold ( like latvians and lithuanians say they do for example ) . 
  the only pressure in speech might be to end an '' - a '' at the end of some female names . 
  people unfamiliar with foreign names might turn `` judit '' and `` edith '' into the more ` confortable ' `` iudita '' and `` edita '' ( but only in speech really ) . 
   you would need to speak french ( easy for romanians ? ), 
  in theory it 's easy , but even if you payed attention in school , spoken colloquial french can be quite difficult to understand at first ( compared to the more standard french you would hear on the radio ) .

  ours are called [ ` decre\u021beii ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decree_770 ) ( i.e. 
  ` children of the [ anti-abortion ] decree ' ), 
  had interviews in both romania and france and as far as i can tell :  are they usually one to one or in groups ? 
  i was alone in the interviews ( but the ones doing the interviews were usually 2-3 , i.e. 
  your immediate superior-to-be , and at least someone from management )  does what you wear matter ? 
  yes , you should look mildly professional . 
   are you expected to act ( overly ) enthusiastic ? 
  why would you ? 
  ( an interview is a two-way street . 
  you 're looking for a job , yes , but they are also looking , for an employee . ), 
   does it mainly consist of you answering questions or do you have to show off your skills ? 
  answering questions ( although last time we went into technical stuff ) . 
  you usually have a 2 week or more trial-period when they can get a better feel for what your actual skills are . 
   are personal questions allowed ? 
  i only remember getting into personal stuff once , when my life plans were getting in the way of their preferred date of starting the job ( i had to push it back a month and a half ) . 
  other than that , i think 1-2 personal questions can be ok , if it is to get a feel of the person . 
  general `` are you married ? '', 
  stuff , not overly detailed stuff . 
   do you personally find them easy or difficult ? 
  if not intrusive , i find them relatively easy . 
  i just answer truthfully . 
  also the level varies from country to country ... 
  yes , [ in transylvania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/transylvania%2c_banat%2c_crisana_and_maramures.svg/640px-transylvania%2c_banat%2c_crisana_and_maramures.svg.png ) , especially so in the darker areas . 
  do n't the brit student societies have some `` stick your dick in a pig 's head ' initiation ritual though ? 
  well , i have heard multiple times people saying that `` antonescu should have finished he started '' , i.e. 
  the ethnic cleansing of roma gypsies . 
  * bucharest * budapest * sofia ( outskirts in transit ) * athens * istanbul * bratislava * prague * vienna * rome ( + vatican city ) * san marino * paris * monaco ville * amsterdam next one will probably be [ berlin ] ( https://youtu.be/o5mim4bpbwe ), 
  i speak : romanian and hungarian ( due to family ) english and french ( due to school ) italian ( due to tv ), 
  or / r/askanamerican, 
  what an ignorant thing to say ... 
  not to contradict your general point , but there are paralels with russia 's siberian frontier , and russia is european . 
  there still are in very very poor communities in romania . 
  unfortunatelly .

  very visible during presidential elections . 
  [ see maps here ] ( https://arnoldplaton.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/ungaria-mare-si-prezidentialele-romane/ ) . 
  transylvania ( the bits that used to be governed by hungarian or german-speaking elites ) tends to lean towards the center-right . 
  the regat ( the bits vasal to the turks that used to be governed by romanian and balkan elites ) towards the center-left . 
  it still retains that meaning in romanian though . 
  `` cocalari '' for the males , `` pi\u021bipoance '' for the females .
